007174889X|4.0|This is a great set to have. As they call it the bible of internal medicine. This is more for reference when you need to expand on a particular disease. Not to be read cover to cover.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I really enjoy the murder/mystery genre, so this book was right up my alley. The ending was confusing, so I had to retread the last four chapters to understand who was who, almost like an Agatha Christie murder mystery. I've become a Harry Hole fan, ( he is somewhat like a Harry Bosch character, but a bit darker.) I'm trying to read the Harry Hole novels in order, hope Amazon can get the translations from the author's earlier works.
0525953728|5.0|The book was wondferful, exciting and an easy read as well as interesting.  It was a fast ship and the packaging was very good.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|My 9 year old and I enjoyed playing this over the weekend. A fun game with good graphics that didn't take too long and wasn't too short. Good value for 99 cents.
0062082353|5.0|Great read... very interesting and exciting.  It is truly amazing what you learn about day to day over there from this book.  Would definitely recommend.
0062127241|4.0|This was almost a great biography, save for one thing.  Townshend does not tell enough stories about the songs from his time with the Who, nor his solo career.  He tells many great tales from every aspect of his career.  All in all this was a solid biography worth reading.
1401324649|4.0|Did anyone else think that this was a bit like the movie Forrest Gump? However, because I really did like that movie, I then enjoyed the book. It is a light read. The author did a great job of describing the characters. I could actually picture them in my mind. Especially sitting around the table at the end of the book...making a plan. I only give four stars because I wouldn't consider this book \\"forever memorable\\", just a really nice read.<br />Maybe we should all look at life like Allan does, \\"just take is as it comes\\".
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I was curious to see what this movie was about (as if you couldn't tell by the title!).  The special effects are great and it does keep your interest throughout, but I think it is not really a great movie only a good one.  And, you have to admire the director and producer for having the courage to make it in the first place.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the structure of the book.  Characters were alternately sympathetic and evil.  Kept me guessing who the truly bad guy was.  The ending was somewhat creepy.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a very good movie.  A simple story that comes alive because of a great cast.  Two thumbs up!
B000I186FW|3.0|This is your typical and fashionable Euro anti-Americanism whereby all the dark forces of European historical absolutism of the left and right is blamed on America and all things American. Anything new here?  Hugo Weaving is great with the alliterative lines.  Yet the simplistic plot thick with overblown acting-- otherwise known as dramatic posturing or 'chewing the scenery' style associated with British acting schools--overwhelms the 'story' if one may even call it that.  Of course we forgive movies with simplistic bombast if they are also entertaining.  V the movie is far more interested in its 2-dimensional statement of 'blame the yanks if life is going to hell in a handbasket' than in any semblance of entertaining its audience or provoking new thought.  I give it a moderate three stars for a jolly good display of Euro acting 101.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|When you sell something as unintuitive as how to use as a tablet camera some minomum information should be included.
B0045XICB2|3.0|The movie skipped, words didn't match the mouths, and some parts were really blurry<br />I would recommend the movie to everyone if quality was better
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am used to physical kybd on my old blackberry. Now on GS3 for 5 weeks. Swype is ok but slow for me. Tried several kybd apps. Swiftkey worked best for autocorrection and speed.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|The movie skipped, words didn't match the mouths, and some parts were really blurry,<br /> I would recommend the movie to everyone if quality was better
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Lacks a rear facing camera. Too expensive not to offer this feature. I will give my Kindle HD to a relative.  I am purchasing the iPad mini, a tablet which has this feature.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Everything she seems to make it just golden in my opinion, this is no different. Vocals and music are both incredible, I keep replaying it over and over again.
B003K16P3M|5.0|There are a few grammatical errors that are a nuisance, but easily overlooked. The characters are well thought out and the story flows with great ease.  I eagerly look forward to diving right in to the next addition.
B00006AFF5|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies. Really did the cartoon justice and the cast was awesome. Must add to any collection
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Fun game, great for killing time in small doses.  It reminds me of newer Space Invaders iterations.  I've always loved these types of games and this one is very well done.<br /><br />The only negative point, IMO, is the inclusion of in-app purchasing.  I realize devs are relying on this model to help detour piracy, but a free app should be free.  Maybe this is more a gripe with Amazon though....
B000JMLFLW|5.0|a book everyone should read if they havent. A love story  anyone would enjoy. Plus Jane Austen wrote it enough said
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I am not a TV junky. Normally I watch Criminal Minds and the news but this show has captured my attention. I am totally addicted to it and could watch the same season over and over again. I was,however very disapointed when a few political positions snuck its way into the story line. It only happened once and I hope it does not happen again. I will be looking for more and more seasons. This series will become a classic. the fictional characters of Olivia, Peter and Walter work so well togeather and are so believable they really do seem to be real and not actors.<br />I cant wait for season six. I pruchased the first 4 seasons, I seldom will buy a series, but will buy as many as they can produce and have told all my friends about it.<br />Good luck to the cast and the writers I am a fan forever. Just stop with the politics!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Gotta love the Winchester boys. Add Bobby and Cas and just makes it so much better. The monsters got scarier. we lost Cas  but got him back. gained a ally in demon Meg and lost Bobby :'(  Just great season.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves Ninjago and recently got this for his birthday and reads it frequently.  I am constantly having him put it back where it belongs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The best way to play this game is with one of the new stylus. It plays like all of the others and is a kick to play but frustrating to get 3 stars (my challenge) to move up.
1401224792|1.0|It pains me to say this being a HUGE Fables fan but this stand-alone graphic novel \\"Werevolves of the Heartland\\" may be the single worst entry in the ENTIRE Fables canon. It's THAT weak. The concept is interesting enough: Bigby Wolf encounters a sleepy, Normal Rockwellesque little hamlet in the Midwest populated by werevolves who worship him as a God and have a mysterious connection to his past.<br /><br />When I first read that tagline I thought \\"Sweet\\"! But then I got the book and that's where the hijinks ended and my tears began. The writing is mediocre...huge chunks of the story are told in blocky, awkward narration. \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" is apparently a technique this writer never learned in Generic Writing School. The entire first fourth of the book is basically a retelling, almost page by page, of a story we have ALREADY read before in the main Fables story. If this had been a monthly it would mean that basically the first issue would have been a retread. I would have seen red if I had bought it.<br /><br />The story is riddled with plot holes. One of the key characters regenerates after being burnt to a crisp because of his werewolf blood...but later in the book it's shown that actually werewolves are terrified of fire because it's one of the few things that can hurt them! Say what? What an amateurish mistake.<br /><br />Bigby meets an old friend, who confesses to terrible, savage crimes and he just shrugs it off as if it was no big deal. This character's wife by the way, is an old enemy of Bigby which he despised deeply...but apparently he's forgotten all about it since it's never mentioned again. The depiction of this couple's first meetings and eventual joining together to create a werewolf town are so terribly written you will struggle not to laugh.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of this work is the art. It's nice and original...reminds me a lot of a discount P. Craig Russell. However, even the art is not without its faults since inexplicably the artist chooses to illustrate every single inhabitant of Wolf Town in the exact same Aryan way so you'll basically have no idea who's who.<br /><br />Not that it matters. Only 13 year olds would be engrossed by this story. I lost interest in the 10th page and just read it the whole thing because of a grim determination to getting my money's worth. Quite frankly I cannot wait to donate this to a local library and get it out of my sight.<br /><br />Do not recommend in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />P.S. I just remembered another thing about the art: near the end of the story...for absolutely NO REASON at all a different artist draws two pages. It's jarring enough to make you wince and I have no idea why it happened. Usually fill in artists are hired to illustrate monthly books because the main artist is behind on schedule. This graphic novel wasn't a monthly publication. It's a stand-alone work written and drawn completely before release. Why in God's name would they need a fill-in artist? This just add to the overall amateurish aspect of the whole thing.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a typical Solitaire game, nothing much to comment on. I need to find a solitaire game that lets me chose which run I will play on. In the meantime I play this on occasion.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is a family favorite. It's sweet & hilarious, and appropriate for kids too. Watching Elf is a Christmas time tradition.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This I find to be quite challenging because there aren't any understandable directions, so I need to kind of guess what I am supposed to do and what the goal is. Because of this, progress is slow, but intriguing. There is an illustrated book - nothing written - to be used as directions - can be used a hints, I guess. Because I am naturally a problem-solver, I find figuring this game out as part of the challenge. I find this game enjoyable.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My little ones love this movie! Great for the whole family! Came quickly to us as well. Great stocking stuffer!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very interesting game. It appears to be easier than it is to connect the dots in completing each &#34;pipe.&#34; Starts out easy and becomes progressively more challenging. There aren't any timers or any other added challenges, which makes this game just plain fun.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I've had both the A50s and the new Tangos.  Sound quality is close probably favors the A50 ever so slightly but the other features pushes the Tangos way ahead
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I purchased this after using the free one. As with anything after you try it - if you like it - buy it! There are progressions and personal completion time to be challenged if you like. I notice that there are three stars for each game. It appears that a game played a 7 minutes gets one star, so must be that fewer minutes earn more of them. The goal must be to get three stars for each game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm in awe, this is just too wow, thats the only word i can think of as of right now
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoyed this enough that I purchased it. The challenge is good and can be stopped and resumed at a later time which is nice while waiting for an appointment.
B008458O3S|5.0|I love the problem solving involved in this game. I have made it through most of the levels, but I am stuck on a few. I love coming back and trying the tough ones over and over. I like the fact that under OPTIONS you can select a second player. My 9yo son is player #2 and he really enjoys the challenge and gets a laugh out of the trains going really fast when he wants to just be crazy. The tutorials provided were very helpful.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil Young is one of the great musicians to transend the ages.  His music is inspiring and inspirational for listeners of all ages.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I would recommend getting the tenth season especially if you enjoy watching Smallville. It's the last season in the series. Clark finally becomes Superman. Disappointed in CW for ending the series.
B003QSMC18|5.0|This is a great story with something for everyone.  Great family values, an excellent adventure, and a happy ending to tie it all up with.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's such a hard game to describe, I guess it's just Build, Discover, Survive.  You can build up, dig down, but just watch out for the creatures that appear in the night.  The world is there to explore and manipulate.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Ground breaking effects that look great on blue ray and HD.  A terrific story with twists turns and lots of action.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show kicks ass!  Surprise after surprise in this show.  All the characters will make you go on a roller coaster of love and hate for them.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I'm 14 years old and still enjoy a great Disney movie and this was another one.  However, I watched it with a 7 year old and she thought is was the coolest movie ever.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Thanks for the shares. When reading the reviews and finding out you don't get the full game at the full game price I decided I will not purchase any more Rovio Angry Birds games any longer. You're cheating us without disclosure first. Shame on you.
B000HL0FQ6|2.0|This show could have been great, but the plot and the way the characters act is just ridiculous.<br /><br />The captain and the crew act like immature, compulsive children with no manners or common sense. They unnecessarily blow up part of a monastery, when they could have just surrounded them from several sides and shot them. There were only 4 Andorians!<br /><br />Then Captain Archer betrays the Vulcans, their main alleys, by deliberately giving the Andorians top-secret Vulcan info. If T'pol was really logical, she would have killed all the Andorians as well as her human crewmates on the spot.<br /><br />It's like this show is a parody of human stereotypes from a Vulcan's point of view, it just makes all humans look like idiots... This show almost has me rooting for the bad guy..
0978545095|5.0|I just LOVE this woman and what she could do with a camera... Genius. I am inspired with her technique and insightfulness. I can literally feel the image in my heart. Such a shame she never received the well deserved accolades in her lonely life...
B008XNZMOU|5.0|As usual this is awesome! Can't wait to hear the next cd!! We will buy them all! Thanks Taylor !
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander articulates an incredible journey describing visuals that at times read like poetry.  He presents his experience in a series of concurrent threads that help to build perspective for the reader. His message, for those who are willing to consider the possibility that there is a heaven and an afterlife, I found to be tremendously reassuring.  He is an excellent writer who understands clearly the challenge of convincing a skeptical reader and has done his best to refute alternate explanations for his recollections.  The book is worth marking up and rereading.
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a non-stop, edge of your seat thriller.  True story of how average people can do extraordinary things.You will love it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm loving Winter of the World and am enthralled with it.  However, my Kindle download is defective and is missing the first pages of almost every chapter.  After contacting Amazon tech help, they determined it was the publisher's fault.  I couldn't believe a book of this stature would have such a glaring flaw.  The third tech also downloaded the book to his Kindle, and it too was missing pages.  It's very frustrating.  When I've finished reading my book they told me I could contact them and be refunded the $19.99. I considered buying the hardbound but at over 900 pages and nearly 3 pounds my wife doesn't want to read that heavy  hard copy nor do I.  Maybe if I paid the hardcover price I could get the whole book?<br /><br />Anyone else out there have missing pages at the beginnings of chapters?
B009YU62H2|5.0|Soundgarden are back and this is one helluva return.Pick it up and turn it up..LOUD..Got it for 4 bucks the week it came out..great bargain at Amazon..

B008MM9630|4.0|this game is ok. I just don't like the fact that the character moves so slow. the graphics are ok as well.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It is fairly basic, but I gave it 4 stars because it does the job and I encountered no problems.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game in a number of Angry Birds; I personally think it is the best. The graphic's are amazing, the game play is hard at times but yet manageable. The characters in Angry Birds Star Wars specifically accomplish with Your help to get rid of the enemy.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|I have two boys but even when I was a kid Mega Bloks was the also-ran to LEGO.  LEGO was the standard.  Wonderful quality, bricks fit together and stayed together.  Mega Bloks never reached that level.  I bought a set here and there, kids would get a set here and there for gifts, and they were never of a level of quality that would favorably compare to LEGO products.<br /><br />Until this set!<br /><br />The fit and finish of the vehicle combined with their already wonderful articulated figures makes this set worth every penny.  We bought the Seraph set also and if that is equally as sturdy I will consider Mega Bloks to have finally reached the summit!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|There seems to be a glitch when you fast-forward or wait out the intro sequence that sends you back to the Kindle Fire home screen. While waiting for the game's menu screen to appear you may notice a white square somewhere in the bottom left corner before the game kicks you back to the Kindle home screen. When you skip the intro or the sequence ends tap the middle of the screen and the bottom left corner near where the white square appears...tap repeatedly without stopping as the screen remains black until you are certain you are not being sent back to the kindle screen...the Spider-man menu should come up. I was having the same problem as everyone else and this worked for me so maybe it can work for others.
B00371XIJE|4.0|Very good movie, but also quite sad, just to prepare you.  Great acting on the dog's part, the people did okay too.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I wasn't really a Papa Roach fan.  My wife wanted me to buy this for her.. Its actually really good. Its their best one yet.
B006IND5M8|4.0|Okay sci fi, but not great... Some high powered actors, but the movie lacked power punch, but worth watching for the fun of it.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I went to Radio Shack and Best Buy asking if there was an adapter that would allow me to play my android music stored on my tablet through an Ipod connection cable in my car. Both stores said no. I went home and did an internet search and found this cable. It works great. I can now easily play the music on my tablet in my car. Thanks CableJive!
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Tropic Thunder takes the cake for the worst movie I've seen! Worse than Battleship, which sucked and should have been called Battlesh*t! But this one is not only idiotic it is downright insulting. Luckily I watched it for free: DVD from my local library. Truly a waste of time!
B000058983|5.0|\\"Well I remember when you used to look so good and I did everything that I possibly could for you...\\"<br /><br />I first discovered this album when a record store owner, having seen me buy tons of CDs for years, cornered me one day and practically forced me to buy it. \\"You will not be disappointed,\\" he said.  Respecting his taste, I took it to my recording studio and gave it my undivided attention. That was in 2003.<br /><br />\\"Served my time, served it well, you made my soul a cell...\\"<br /><br />My initial impression was rather puzzling. The sound took me back to the Summer of Love (which I was too young to appreciate) and I remember feeling both intrigued and repulsed by the music coming out of my monitors. The record store owner had warned me that it might take a few listens to \\"get it.\\" I had had that experience on several albums, not really liking them at first but gradually giving them a chance to work their magic. I played it a few times in the weeks that followed and one Sunday afternoon it hit me with full-force. \\"This is an incredible album!\\" I declared. I found myself singing along with the tunes and the themes and imagery were resonating with me on a very deep level. I swear that CD LIVED in my player for months because I couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />\\"You are just a thought that someone, somewhere, somehow feels you should be here...\\"<br /><br />That was no small feat. I'm a hardcore CD collector and I work in the music industry as an engineer, musician, and consultant. There isn't much out there I haven't heard. Forever Changes is now one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br /> \\"Moon's a common scene around my town<br />Yeah where everyone is painted brown<br />And if we do get stuck away<br />Let's go paint everybody gray\\"<br /><br />What makes this album unique is its combination of clear musical composition, deep emotional expression, fantastic instrumental playing, and top-notch singing. Yes, the lyrics are nonsensical at times, but that's part of the charm. You don't have to ask, \\"What did he mean by that phrase?\\" You can FEEL it. Forever Changes is a product of its turbulent time, but its themes are timeless.<br /><br />\\"The news today will be the movies for tomorrow...\\"<br /><br />You may have to listen to this record a bunch of times before it grabs you. And grab you it will. The \\"Voice\\" of this record has no ego or attitude, it doesn't brag and it doesn't judge. It makes you think, about yourself, your life, what it means and really, what it ALL means. It asks big questions, it warns, it despairs, it celebrates, it hopes, and it cares, about you, about EVERYBODY. It isn't Arthur Lee's point of view, it's THE point of view. You know, the one we should all be listening to. This record is your conscience. And it isn't very happy about some of the choices you've made. But that doesn't seem to matter. What matters is that you listened, took stock of yourself and learned something. Something profound about what it means to be human, to be alive and have a choice in how one lives and loves.<br /><br />\\"Write the rules in the sky, but ask your leaders why...\\"<br /><br />Musically, one can hear bits and pieces of many influences. Forever Changes doesn't get bogged down in one type of musical expression. The parts fit together perfectly in a seamless mosaic. They transcend the mundane to create an addictive, intoxicating soundscape that's impossible to resist.<br /><br />\\"There's a man who can't decide if he should<br />Fight for what his father thinks is right\\"<br /><br />When Forever Changes was recorded, the Vietnam War was just coming into national focus. It wasn't going well and the body count was rising. There was growing opposition from the Flower Children, who found themselves fighting a non-enemy to no purpose. An undercurrent of foreboding permeates the record, but it's not depressing in the least. In the end, \\"You Set the Scene\\" sums up its optimism clearly:<br /><br />\\"This is the time in life that I am living, and I'll face each day with a smile...\\"<br /><br />Ultimately Forever Changes is a celebration but it is much more than that. It's a positive statement about life in America in the late 20th Century that no one is ever going to forget.<br /><br />\\"They're locking them up today<br />They're throwing away the key<br />I wonder who it'll be tomorrow you or me?\\"<br /><br />Buy this CD and give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.hat I am living, and I'll face each day with a smile...\\"<br /><br />Ultimately Forever Changes is a celebration but it is much more than that.

B0090EJ99A|1.0|I felt like a fool for wasting my money on a very avoidable movie. It is replete with misogyny, hurtful stereotypes, puerile sketches. All of these things can provide for a supremely sarcastic, yet entertaining farce, if done right (provided you are the kind of person who can find this stuff funny). However, in this movie is most of the above were absolutely unfunny. The entire movie ends up being a string of poorly thought out and badly executed sketches. The joke truly was on me, the viewer, for paying to watch this.
0596522347|5.0|Nancy Durate's books are amazing!! Do you know why? I read hundreds of books. They are full with the \\"what\\" and \\"why\\" but very poor with the \\"how\\".<br />Nancy's books are clear with the what and why but more importantly they tell you how to make it happen, how to implement it and how to achieve great results.<br /><br />This book is not the only one I like. I loved reading \\"Resonate\\". It's a reference book. Simply reading Nancy's book is a journey towards success.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love how rick reordan put two narriators instead of one. It rally let's you understand the story and the two main characters. I also love how he mixed a already fantastic story and added one or two crushes between characters. I have noticed that he must really love history and myths based on all the ancient Greek and Egyptian myths in his books. This is a really Interesting book that will probably make you want to read up on your Egyptian history if you don't already know most of the stuff they talk about.

B002436WFI|3.0|The movie is great! I'd recommend the movie hands down. I had to own it for myself. However, I was looking forward to the bonus features (deleted scenes, blooper reel, actor interviews, etc.) that was promised in the product's description, but this version only had the movie itself, so I'm quite disappointed on that front.

This particular calculator was a great choice, better than the average, was looking for something not to complex with the ability to calculate percent easily. Currently using for about two weeks and have not considered looking for something better.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|lnteresting.- didn't know that there were three books in the series or I might not have read it. . Still it was pretty good.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Was happy to find this film at such a great price.  Good fun and entertainment for the whole family. Great Value.
B00846TTDG|2.0|Kind of disappointed by this movie. Not very strong story or high-tech stuff. I don't think it is well positioned as an action movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is just awesome I love the hole thing my favorite mob is a creeper and my favorite thing to do is explore
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect about this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise.  The movie was not quirky or cheesey.  It was a nice carefree movie.
B006PAZMMK|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. Some songs do not jump out and seem too similar to the popular ones.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|dragonvale is really neat<br />if I had any compliants it would be they do not give you a lot of gems to use
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I like this album because of the hit song(s) in it and I recommend it to the mainstream listeners out there.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|My 20 year old daughter and my 17 year old son affectionately remember this film and enjoy watching it with my granddaughter.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I liked this album. Frank does a good job with vocal and from my opinion create art with his music.
B008602KQI|4.0|this movie is a very well acted movie...close enough adaptation of book...action packed...if the nex one is as good I looking forward to second installment...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best new sci fi novels I have read in a long time.  The style of the writing perfectly suits the story and the witty, sometimes cynical, views of big organisations really hits the spot.  It kept me rivetted to the very end
B005WYFLNU|3.0|Our 5 year old girl likes it and even the 10 year old girl has given it a try, too. It was hard for the young one to remove the pieces initially but once they were out it was easy to use but she has lost many of the shoes.  They are like Colorforms of old.  Press to adhere, easy to peel off. Nothing sticky.  As far as little girl cuteness, it's exactly what you'd expect.  You've got your basic cheerleading outfit, some costume type items, and various dresses and gowns. Lots of shoes. Depicted are scenes of a slumber party, ballet recital, party time, runway fun and wedding day. There are girls of various skin tones and hair colors, but is 2/3 lighter skin. The clothing items are modest.  It kept my daughter happy for a few hours but certainly won't be around long.
B004I744AS|5.0|I never thought I'd like a Dictionary so much but this App is so cool specially the extra games it has it's fun and at the same time your learning.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a \\"sleeper.\\"  Thought for the price it'd be a dog, turned out to be one of the best books I'd read this year.  Sort of a Robinson Caruso on Mars, with a delightful and captivating series of events that kept me glued to this book for many enjoyable hours.  Very rich in technological details and frequent problems occurring that require skills, all editorialized with a charming black humor by the hero.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|It makes it easy to find and the strap makes it easy to carry and it keeps it safe.It is easy to find and easy to put away.
B000FC10MU|1.0|I heard nothing but praise for this book prior to picking it up. I saw dozens of copies at most books stores I went to in the 'staff pick' section. After reading it ( not all the way through mind you, I got within 100 pages of the end and finally gave up ), I can't see why this book is so well liked. I haven't read any of Gaiman's other work, so I may not be getting the entire picture of his style, but this book was so choppy and stuttering, jumping from scene to scene and plot to plot with very little transition or explanation. The plot is all over the place, and it seems to be missing a singular thread to tie it all together. It seems like a bunch of interesting notes jotted down and then later Frankensteined into something resembling a a coherent story. How in the world does someone make a war between new technology based gods and obsolete mythological gods boring?!?! This book manages to do so by drowning any interesting parts in mundane tedium. I have never really regretted reading a novel before, but this is absolutely the closest I have come.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I'm always facinated by the things I read about heaven. Although the book was ok, it was a slow read. I kept wanting to finish it already so I could start on something else.
030746363X|5.0|I love the way the book is assembled. You can scroll through and find subjects you care about or you can read and learn it all. His advice on losing 20 lbs per month without exercising works. The kettle-bell adds muscle in a few minutes per week just as the book promises. I guess what I am saying is that the advice in this book works! You should try it.
B001R4BTSU|5.0|This is the kind of music that you have to listen in a vinyl,is better than a digital or cd (I have all).
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very interesting book told by a well-known academic neurosurgeon. It is thought provoking and original and very worth reading.
098478280X|5.0|I am in the stage where I have started to prepare for coding interviews. After reading many reviews and recommendations from my friends, I've decided to buy this book. According to me, this is a must have book for interview preparations(coding).
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|Silent Hill Revelation 3D Review: Stunning Native 3D Dimension<br /><br />3D:<br />If you're looking for the best 3D available in horror cinema, look no further than Silent Hill Revelation 3D. With its stunning, powerful 3D, the characters, demons and monsters are presented with incredible dimension comparable to Avatar 3D and even surpasses the 3D efforts of Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Not only does it deliver powerful 3D among the best movies 3D has to offer, but also sustains this 3D from start to finish.<br />The pop outs are second to none, reaching way past the barrier of the screen as monsters strike out at the viewer. Particles like falling ash/snow and a nice variety of scenery, in the city, school, amusement park, etc. I cannot say enough good things about the 3D dimension, depth, pop outs and volume in Silent Hill Revelation. Spectacular 3D.<br /><br />The film itself follows up the story of Mason (Sean Bean), and his now older adopted Daughter Heather, who is being sought by the evil order of Silent Hill's underworld, to free them from their hell bound prison  by using her as a vessel for their deity. Discovering more as she proceeds, she abandons her hope for a normal life, and re-enters Silent Hill in search of her father and experiences the relentless monsters inhabiting the realm. The story focuses heavily on detailing (back story) as much as possible, why she is there, and how she can resolve her horrifying situation. The sirens return along with the fog, the town with empty buildings, familiar and new monsters and the metal and twisted creatures of the dark realm.<br /><br />3D Dimension: 10/10<br />3D Depth: 10/10<br />3D Volume: 10/10<br />3D Pop Out: 10/10<br />3D Overall: 10/10<br /><br />Story; 7/10 Interesting, but with loose ends and much back story.<br />Acting: 7/10. Good range of emotion among some decent acting delivery.<br />Horror: 7/10. Plenty of scare moments, but mostly disturbing imagery.<br />Visuals: 9/10. Disturbing imagery at every turn with great special FX and monsters.<br />Gore: 6/10. There are some gory moments, but not many.<br /><br />Overall: Entertaining visualization of a nightmarish realm in spectacular 3D. Do not pass this one up if you need a horror 3D film to add to your library.very turn with great special FX and monsters.<br />Gore: 6/10.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|The injection of the Star Wars characters makes this version of Angry Birds a lot more fun. I highly reccommend it.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I deleted half of my apps so it could fit, but when it finally downloaded, after watching the lengthy intro, it closes. Every time I open it, it just closes back!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was fun and interesting. I'm looking forward to part 2. once I started to play I didn't want to stop.
B005R32L66|5.0|I purchased Skype app from a free app option for Pnasonic tablet, it down loaded and now I am able to enjoy it interanationally.
0316227706|5.0|For the author to publish this book after seeing his photos on the Internet. It is fabulous! Would strongly recommend to dog lovers.
B002NWOOXW|1.0|Thought I would like it because I liked the first one so much,  but it is terrible!!!!  Not even my favorite actors could save it.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok just so you know its FREE and the update came out so yeah don't be blabbing about it being too much money and not being worth it.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean really did a great job with this album. If you're a fan of his work with Odd Future you should get well acquainted with the more personal side of this artist. Pyramids is probably one of the best songs I've ever heard.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Nice retro game play and will likely provide me with hours of distraction. Would have received five stars if there were continue options on death of the Velocispider.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Game is fun but mindless. Great for wasting time waiting in line ect. Very colorful and gets harder as you go.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|Newman finally writes an action score and he is superb at it. I feel sorry for all those who dismiss it as &#34;not Bond enough&#34;. I guess people just don't like change.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Of coarse this was a great purhase.  dexter is a great piece of entertainment.and I want to have it at home.  I love it
B004W2UBYW|3.0|The book shows the best and the worst of a controversial man that change the world with his vision and gadgets
B002N5N5M0|5.0|.. I needed another season of dexter.  Gotta have it.  Great storyline. Love it. Only a few more seasons eft to get.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic series! Lots of blood, gore, and violence, some nudity, great acting, real emotional depth, cohesive and complex story line. Thank-you Amazon Instant Video!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Loads up and lookes pretty,  but only displays the latest 10 or so posts. Very frustrating. Fixing that and enabling me to share other peoples posts would be great.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Not very challenging, but loads of fun. My 5 year old loves it and he already finished all the levels.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If you're an action adventure fan, Homeland is a must see.  From the first episode to the last it is non-stop action, with twists and turns that will keep you guessing and wanting more.  I highly recommend!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was the first book I've read by this author.  What a waste of time! Just dumb.  Got me hooked at the beginning, but started rambling with twists and turns that didn't make sense.  And the end!  Wow!  Don't waste your time on this book.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I have watched this movie 4 times ad sure I'll watch it more than just that. Awesome Movie well done Johnny
0307951529|5.0|As someone who is living that dream, I appreciated this book. Some people just aren't going to get it but others are going to. I found this book to be an easy read filled with easy to activate lessons and plenty of good, practical advice -even for a guy like me who is already doing it. The advice is basic, but if you listen - you will get the message.<br /><br />All there is to it, is to do it. That's what my Caribbean friend told me to kick my ass into gear. I hope that Chris's message kicks your ass into gear if it isn't already. If it is - you dig it the most.<br /><br />Thanks Chris. It's a message that those of us who listen are glad to hear again and again. I'll let you know if your advice helps take my biz to the next level, but I'm pretty sure it already has.<br /><br />~Vago Damitio
0316228532|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book. All the characters were so unhappy, and the book ended up in my unfinished pile. Loved the Harry Potter series and would definitely recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|they should bring down the price because I want this but my parents said I cant it costs to much so bring down the price or make a lite free verizon of minecraft please. like if u agree.
B009EELDWW|5.0|This is a modernized movie length version of the A-Team show from the 1980s.  If you are the type of person who is bothered by logical flaws and plot holes, this is not the movie for you.  If you want to see what an A-Team episode would look like if they doubled the length of an episode, added top flight actors, and used modern special effects, then this is the movie for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game always keeps my friends occupied when I am so busy. when I have free time I love playing the games
B0047WJ12K|3.0|The dream tampering idea is a pretty new sci-fi concept to me. It had pretty decent special effects most of the time (some of the explosions in the snow scene appeared fake. Character interest wasn't developed too well in my opinion.
B006GH6IWU|4.0|My only issue with this CD was that it is too short! I wanted more!<br />Interesting interviews with the guys. Good music videos.<br />Nicely told history, all the way to the sad end.<br />I do recommend this!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So addictive. Great ideas! Everything is very practical. Love creating my own boards and organizing ideas. _ _ _  _
B00021R7CG|4.0|Having grown-up during the cold war, this story was quite possible when released in the '80s.  The cast was real talented and many of them are still working and are stars.  There is a little bit of cheesiness, but what the hey; just enjoy the movie and hope that we never return to that mentality.
B006GLM5EQ|1.0|I thought there was no way that this show could be as bad as the reviews said it was.  I should have listened!  This show was so tacky it was pitiful!
B00124BNF4|5.0|I bought this on a $5 deal and what a deal it was!  Listen with good headphones to notice the many quiet intrumentals that were very well produced.
B008KW43TE|2.0|Not sure why this got such great reviews because I disagree.  I bought this because I loved his previous songs &#34;Novacane&#34; and &#34;Swim Good&#34; as well as &#34;Thinkin Bout You&#34; off this album, but was very disappointed.  I think there may have been one or two other OKAY songs, but nothing great.
B0001WTVUW|2.0|Despite a few big name actors, I just didn't believe or care about the characters.  The budget must have been fairly low and production time may have been short.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|The whole album is good, but my two favorite songs are #8 - &#34;What Now&#34; and #9 - Stay... I can't get enough of those two!
141659521X|5.0|Normally I don't Write reviews but I have become so tired of the constant one and two star ratings on really good books because of the high prices on the Kindle book. It's not fair to the author who doesn't set the price and who worked very hard to write these books for us. So, please people stop giving one and two star ratings because of the book price - you are just bastardieing the rating system, not accomplishing any thing and should spend your energy writing to the publishers.  Amazon is powerless to change the prices.<br /><br />Now, to the book.  Mitch is back and better than ever! If you are a Vince Flynn fan, you will enjoy this novel.  The plotting is very interesting as well as the action.  I hope we get another installment soon.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I luv this game. it reminds me of a game I use 2 play wen I waz lil.its so addicting and so much fun.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like mahjong, you'll like this. nice music, good graphics, I can't really complain about anything with this game.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Soundgarden is my all time favorite band. So needless to say, I was very curious to see what they would sound like after almost two decades of down time...<br /><br />I have to admit, this is what I consider a \\"quality\\" rock album. One that doesn't hit you at first, but you like it more and more each time you listen to it.<br /><br />In retrospect, I think I was initially put off by the lack of the angry, hard sound of \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" or the naked emotionalism of \\"Overfloater\\"...but then I realized that this isn't 1992 Soundgarden...this is 40-something-year-old Soundgarden.<br /><br />By expecting something similar to what I'd known, I was inadvertently putting my band in a box. Since I wanted something that sounded like early twenty-something Soundgarden I was, in effect, asking them to be something they're not.<br /><br />They are 2012 Soundgarden...which, as it turns out, is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't play any of my fb games, nor can I select to have my newsfeed organized by most recent rather than top stories, I want to be the one to decide which posts are important thank you very much. I can't search for pages that I've liked unless they've posted recently. Honestly the only thing it is good for is checking my friends' statuses when I can't get to a computer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so fun! it is made well and I have no complaints! it is challenging but it is still fun!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It has too many ads that you have to get rid of before it will let you play, it's kind of annoying. other than that it's fine.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Enjoying this app very much.  Ive spent hours scouring Amazon for good music/ sound for relaxation &amp; meditation; this is as good as anything Ive purchased.  Love the binaural beat feature.
B001KZG99A|3.0|A little ridiculous in the technology feats (building a super-tech suit with hammers and a welder), but that's comic books.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is awesome as the heavy.
B009KKLQVS|2.0|Having seen the 50th anniversary concert in person, I expected better.  Less than half of the actual playlist is on this DVD with many of the best memories omitted.  I'm sure there is enough fottage left to issue a \\"volume two\\" which could include the rest of the concert.  Hopefully the powers that be will consider releasing the complete concert at some time in the future before all of the baby boomers that love this group are dead and gone.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I loved the movie, but they could have left out the 3 way.  I dont think any guy, that was sane, would let his best friend have sex with his girlfriend.  The action was awesome, but the love story was weak!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Dont get sucked in by fake reviews. The game does NOT work on Kindle. Believe me now thank me later. locked up wont restart on kindle fire. what a pos. glad I only spent a buck.<br /><br />save your money. get a game that works.
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie about 6%. While I cannot say it's that bad...it's pretty darn bad. There are many bad things about this movie.<br /><br />Now...if you are going to take a plot out of any of the Silent Hill games...Then take it from Silent Hill 2. Because that was the best of the bunch and it had a great mysterious story? Nope...Instead they decided to have a main character from Silent Hill 3... This in and of itself isn't bad. But when they decide to try and make the movie like the game...it is bad. First there is the creepy relationship between the dad and the daughter. Several awkward moments.<br /><br />Next they make it a habit of dishing out items (like you would in a game) The vest the main character wears, a crest of some type... All of which works nice in a game. But not at all in a movie. It just ends up sounding dumb. It'd be like creating a Zelda movie and focusing the plot on gathering a fishing pole.<br /><br />Next they bring back characters just to bring them back. The nurses were creepy in the first....but in the second they are just dumb. Not scary at all. Next pyramid head, which is the greatest creepy antagonist of all time is reduced to a puppet this time...Not shining on his own but being a protector of Alessa.<br /><br />The graphics were awesome. Some of the monsters were to. But there was no plot, nothing developed enough for you to care. It wasn't scary or suspensful. The end boss fight was laughable. I found it more funny than scary. Since they've skipped over the best story in the franchise, I can only imagine where it goes from here. Don't give into any hype. It was a bad movie. It might be worth a rent for a few cents, but nothing more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|When I first watched this movie on TV, is have to say I was unimpressed.  However, the following Christmas I gave it a second chance and began to see how great the movie actually is.  I love the story and the animation.  Check it out if you haven't yet or maybe give it a second chance, you might be surprised at what you find.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is really intuitive and easy to use on my kindle. Love the interface. Couldn't be more pleased. glad its free.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I found myself immediately wrapped up in this story as only Stephen King can draw me in.  It was really nice to see some \\"old friends\\" from Derry as well as the new characters.  While I think some elements of the near-end of the book were a bit over-the-top and stretched a little too far beyond believability, overall this book was excellent and I am glad to have read it.  As a near lifelong fan of King, this did not disappoint.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I've been using it for only a short time so will edit this review later and add more details later.
B0045XICB2|4.0|This series was alot better than I thought it would be. Not the norm for vampires and I will always say that vampires DONT glitter but still a good series.
B000VZE398|5.0|Awsome live album wouldn't expect anything less from Nine Inch Nails. I wish I would've of been able to see them live.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I would have expected this from a free app but not one I had to pay for I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this app because I played it for about 5minutes closed out of it and when I went to go back in it did exactly what all the other reviews said played the intro and went right back to my home screen. save your money and don't buy it
B0043UB0EI|4.0|We love it. Great series. My bf thinks the blood scenes and cinematography should be more realistic. But still great.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|The tiles are so small that you cannot see them. How are you supposed to play a game that you can't see???
B005HSL626|5.0|good game, stop complaining. about ads though, tots a free game. and its really fun, I reccomend this game to anyone that just wants to have fun and relax
B00A4NWSDK|5.0|I love Kid Rock's New album, especially all his songs referring to Detroit. Detroit rocks!<br />Love that Kid Rocks loves his home town and the State of Michigan!! Keep it<br /> coming!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Disney did it again. Although there is a misconception about the plot of the movie when you watch the  trailer, Brave still captures it's audience with stunning animation and non-stop suspense throughout. I gave this movie a four star rating because of the predictable story line and dialog that has plagued Disney animated films for quite some time, but since this movie was aimed at children aged 6-10 and their parents, then it serves the demographic well. Great animation, the diverse culture of the characters mixed with the thick accents was on point, definitely recommend for the family.
0142501247|2.0|We bought this hoping my son would take to it after &#34;where's spot&#34; was such a hit.  No go, he's totally uninterested.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|The only reason I reviewed this movie was because Amazon wouldn't stop sending me emails to review it. The story has a lot of holes. PERIOD. Tim Burton did his usually superb cinematography, but it didn't make up for the writing in this movie. It had all the potential to be a great dark comedy, but the movie really had no substance. Only way I would own this movie is if it were less than what I paid to rent it or it was on Netflix.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I pretty much live on facebook and am on everyday.  The games are great and can pretty much find everything I need to know about.  Love keeping in touch with family and friends.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We purchased this movie for the grandchildren.  It arrived in two days.  I have a feeling this will be a family favorite!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Fun game to waste some time. It's like Space Invaders, but with power ups and a nostalgic 80s/90s era soundtrack.
B002GNRA1Q|1.0|The whole series just gets a thumbs down from me because the last few seasons just kept getting worse and worse.  The very end was a disaster that made me feel like I should have been doing anything but watching this show.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|although i enjoyed the movie i kept running across things that were very very similiar to alien movies...copy alien stuff okay..copy story elements over and over again then you get snoozefest.
B00A9Q70Y4|3.0|This is the first show that I've actually looked forward to watching each week in a very long time, but this season is lacking. I have left nearly each episode either furious with the writers, or with a feeling of \\"meh\\" about what just happened. I want to like the characters, I want them to make intelligent decisions, I want to see something interesting (not just over-the-top or extremely shocking) happen! Hoping the episodes get better soon, or I may lose interest altogether.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Our entire family LOVES this movie!  We have fun identifying family members with each character!  lol  We highly recommend it!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Thought this movie might be entertaining, but after half an hour I had to stop. Based on what I saw, I'd give it a 2-star rating but I bumped it up to 3 stars deciding that I probably just didn't give it enough time. I'm sad to say that in the case of this film, I'm one of those people that 'just doesn't get it.'
B00A8ECU24|5.0|please be my buddy in Gameloft I have no one for a friend this game IS made by Gameloft!!!!!  :(  ;)
B0090P0O70|5.0|A great classic that portrays the human spirit. Ambition, good and evil, regret, and innocence. A must have for everyone's collection.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I loved how fast it was shipped to my house and that it was so much less money then it was in the stores.
1594203334|4.0|I thought it was very well written and a good read.  Druckerman approaches it not as a self-help or “how to book,” but autobiographically as both a journalist and American mother living in Paris, comparing and contrasting Anglophile and Parisian styles of parenting.  It’s really a thoughtful cultural perspective, as she struggles to put together what makes sense to her in raising her children. She makes note of the French emphasis on gently providing children opportunities to “learn/educate” patience/frustration tolerance/delayed gratification/self-sufficiency/manners.  Another interesting piece was the French parent’s manner of being “authoritative without being authoritarian.”  One of Druckerman’s parting comments was how she is “still striving for the French ideal:  genuinely listening to my kids but not feeling that I must bend to their will.”
B0086VWCPG|3.0|I upgraded from the free version with the expectation of more bells and whistles, but found that I did not get the automatic weather and also my view of the maps no longer worked. Also had issues with the upload to Facebook. The website for questions or problems with the app was not user friendly. When I submitted questions for my problems, I did not get direct feedback. You have to browse through hundreds of question from other users. I never did find the answers for my questions. The free version worked better than the upgrade to Pro.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great story line, good character cohesion, thoughtful and endearing movie.  I would recommend this to anyone young or old. Yippee!
B003O86FMW|3.0|After reading the first book (The Hunger Games) I was thinking that this book would be as fast pace as the first, however it was not. The book has a nice pace to it to keep the reader wanting to read more. Once you get through the first couple of chapters, the action begins and it does not stop until you finish the series. The author allows you to get to know the individual characters without distracting the reader from the main character and objectives she wishes to fulfill.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Another of my favorites.  Great acting, story line is strong, and lots of subtle humor.  ALTHOUGH ITS A BROMANCE IT IS A WAY BETTER LOVE STORY THAN TWILIGHT!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good book that had little surprises throughout the chapter to keep the reader engaged. I must admit that the beginning was a little dry and at time I thought hmmmm is it going to be as good as I imagined...and the answer is yes it is. The author slowly brought you into the world of Panem and allowed you to be a witness to the uprising and feel as if your in the battle first hand.  The author also kept the reader engaged by placing a &#34;cliff hanger&#34; at the end of each chapter so the reader can't help but to want to continue. Overall I enjoyed reading the book...the ending would leave the reader satisfied but yearning for more of The Hunger game series
B00190OHD6|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  A true love story.  It sucks you in and by the end after all the tears you have a smile on your face.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|very well done, crazy cool I got my bf to suggest we watch a musical that's never been his thing. But there wasn't a single song on the soundtrack he didn't sing along to
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Thought it was going to be really bad but actually turned out okay.  Not the best acting but had some really good moments.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Fun game but really hard even on the first game. good graphics very addictive, not for a novice. A a
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two Steps from Hell has released another masterpiece. &#34;Invincible&#34; and &#34;Archangel&#34; were masterpieces themselves. So how do you follow up those albums? TSFH did it with Skyworld. It's been my favorite album since it's release, especially when I am up driving around in Colorado's mountains. I specifically recommend &#34;El Dorado&#34;, &#34;Winterspell&#34; and &#34;Blackheart&#34;. Stop reading these reviews and buy the album. It's only $8, but frankly as good as it is I'd have paid $25.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have heard repeatedly that this series was the better version of Fifty Shades. I don't agree. I enjoyed this read just as equally as I enjoyed Fifty and I'm not to keen on all the comparisons I have heard/read. Mainly because although there are some similarities all throughout I think both story lines make such similarities not only insignificant but mere coincidence. I mean just look at sci-fi and fantasy novels.<br /><br />Anyway I can't wait to read the next instalment of this series (which I'll undoubtably purchase after this review) and find out what happens next for Gidieon and Eva. Awesome read and story that sucks you in so deeply you won't want to come up for air or food until you've turned the last page.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This turntable is perfect and is priced so cheap that I can't believe Sony can afford to make it. I fits my needs great and am enjoying all my old album collection on cd now.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Wonderful film. Looked great on my new flat screen TV. Looking forward to my next purchase.<br />The connection was good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very slow start to the game unless you wantto spend real money to buy game money and permits. The review this game on several media's as goals is very silly. The game is in day 2 and my city is coming along though so far so good. But wish you didn't have to buy progress.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|\\"North and South\\" is the powerful story of a sheltered clergyman's daughter uprooted from an idyllic home in the south of England to the gray and gritty north. There she clashes with a stern factory owner and befriends several millworkers as they protest the poor conditions and pay.<br /><br />This mini-series has so much to recommend it, especially its leading man. Deep-voiced, hawkish Richard Armitage (who, I predict, will become the next Official British Dreamboat when \\"The Hobbit\\" is released) is masterful in his role as the industrialist. Even when his character, John Thornton, is inflexible, Armitage gives glimpses of the conflicted and honourable man beneath.  When he finally shows his tender side, it's swoonworthy.<br /><br />(For a real appreciation of Armitage's range--and to see his great, cheeky, Daniel Radcliffey grin--I highly recommend viewing \\"The Holy Wholly Happy  Ending\\" episode of \\"The Vicar of Dibley.\\"  He is the ideal Tall Handsome Stranger. He and the brilliant Dawn French are marvelous fun together).<br /><br />While Armitage is a standout, he is backed by an amazing cast.  Tim Pigott-Smith and Sinead Cusack are excellent, as always, and Brendan Coyle--now best  known for his role as the valet in \\"Downton Abbey\\"--brings real fire and contained fury as a union leader.<br /><br />Sandy Welch (who wrote the fabulous Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of \\"Jane Eyre\\") works wonders with the script, as do all involved in creating this 19th-century world. The scenes in the mill are especially beautifully photographed and haunting--the cotton fibers drifting through the interior look simultaneously like a magical blizzard and a white hell.<br /><br />The one aspect of this series that wasn't superb is its lead, Daniela Denby-Ashe. While I liked her more on a second viewing, there is still something lacking in her perfomance. She physically looks the part--she has a dairy-maid complexion and a curvy, Victorian figure--and there are times when some spirit shows through.  However, there are several key scenes--including holding a dying girl and the grand finale--when she seems to just check out emotionally, and her reactions are bewilderingly placid. We need to see Margaret's spark and sparkle, even when she is subdued or contemplative, but sometimes Denby-Ashe just seems blank.<br /><br />Despite Denby-Ashe's occasional tepid acting, I'm giving this production 5 stars because the series succeeds so beautifully in every other way.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I'm not a typical rater for music. (5) of the songs on this CD make me move and I sing along with the catchy choruses. Favorites: Demons, Radioactive, It's time and On Top of the World
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Absolutely delightful. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is arguably Jane Austen's breeziest, most light-hearted novel, and this BBC adapation gets the tone and subject just right. In fact, it's hard to imagine how this production could be bettered.  It joins Emma Thompson's interpretation of \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam version of \\"Emma\\" and the BBC Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in most accurately capturing Jane Austen's characters and world.<br /><br />Felicity Jones triumphs in the role of Catherine Morland, a good-hearted but naive girl who learns not to let her imagination--or her gullibility--misinterpret people or situations. Ingenues are often unbearably simpering or one-dimensional, but Jones brings so much humor, sweetness, and integrity to the role that we totally understand why discerning clergyman Henry Tilney (a charming JJ Feild) falls for her.<br /><br />The cast, as is generally true of these productions, is uniformly excellent. Catherine Walker gives a particularly affecting performance as Henry's sister Eleanor.  In the subtlest ways--an anxious smile, pressed-together hands, a near-bow--she suggests a young woman both dignified and repressed.  Carey Mulligan also shines as the shallow Isabella, who uses her winsomeness and wiles to secure one man as she seeks out another, richer one. (Screenwriter Andrew Davies takes a major liberty with Isabella's fate, but it is in keeping with her character and makes her subsequent behavior even more telling).<br /><br />I don't know where they find all these wonderfully natural child actors (is great thespianism part of the British DNA?), but the youngsters playing Catherine's siblings are unselfconsciously adorable. They, along with the actors who portray Catherine's likeable, salt-of-the-earth parents, really give an impression of a secure and happy household.<br /><br />The music by Charlie Mole deserves a special nod. The violin theme that plays when Henry and Catherine ride out together is achingly beautiful and all too brief.  In fact, the soundtracks from the BBC Austen offerings of about 5 years ago were often the highlights of otherwise iffy productions.  I wish the BBC would come out with a compilation...<br /><br />Catherine's fantasies are amusing, if predictable, as her imagination becomes more and more fevered by reading lurid gothic romances. Without showing too much, they hint at her awakening sexuality (the 1980's version to me is unwatchable, in part because the fantasies shown there are gruesome rather than sensual).<br /><br />\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is the perfect film to watch for a winter pick-me-up.  Or, really, any time you want an hour and a half of undiluted film pleasure. (I understand some parts were trimmed from its British release and hope to see them included sometime, but I felt that the story ran smoothly even with these omissions).
1451695195|5.0|This book is an amazing testament to the power of the human spirit. Through his experience, Dr. Alexander changed himself from a skeptic to a believer. Not a believer in the conventional sense, but a believer in the Truth about God and Eternal Spirit. It's the stuff they don't teach you in church. They can't, because they have no first-hand experience of what the other side is like. It is difficult enough to put into words when you have actually been there, because there are no mortal words to describe the other side of the veil. For the Holy men in our temples and churches who are bound by the scripture they have been taught, who have no first-hand experience, it is impossible.<br />Dr. Alexander has been there, and through a true medical miracle, he has lived to tell the tale. Read this book. It could transform your life!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|You will not regret buying this....I am actually pretty old to be a ONE DIRECTION fan but after watching them on XFACTOR UK, I was amazed by their talent and instantly became a fan.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|The movie is great. And the instant view was amazing. I streamed the whole movie via 4G network, not once did it stop to buffer, skip, or lose sound quality. However, I should have rented it instead of buying it. I'm new to this digital media--maybe Amazon could offer a return that results in only charging me the rental price instead of the full purchase price. Does Amazon have a program to rent digital media with an option to buy, thus the rental fee would be applied to the cost to own?
1451695195|5.0|After watching Dr.Alexander on a few television programs promoting his book, I felt compelled to grab a copy for myself. His story will add weight to the NDE phenom and hopefully drive home the fact that we are all here for a reason and move on to next level when this expierence is complete. I always felt the Christian view was closest to man's way of comprehending the after life. Love, beauty, angelic beings, and a loving creator is what awaits us all. Atheists really need to read this book and think long and hard about their worldview. We have a purpose. We have lessons to learn. God is real.
0525952926|5.0|Having read the first installment of the Century Trilogy I was very excited to read his second part. The story picks up almost right where it left off (not to the point where you couldn't skip the first) and has the same entertaining and twisted flow. Only downside is the story is awfully predictable but, I believe this trilogy is too entertaining to take a star off for that small purpose. Loved every page of it and you will too!
B0013TTLDE|1.0|I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them thoroughly. This one I did not. It was slow and almost completely lacked any movement in the plot.  Its style reminds me of a biography where there are lots of tangents and ramblings.  I kept thinking it would get better so I kept reading.  Wow I was really wrong.  Very boring.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for a convenient app to connect me to my favorite local radio stations and this one is perfect.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I hate that this game resets it by itself.  I can be fighting the lizardturn the game off and I would have to restart not cool
1608871045|5.0|Like a pop up book for your full grown geek. My boyfriend absolutely loved his birthday gift. It comes super packaged so nothing is missing.... had a disc in it, though I'm not sure if it was a cd, dvd, or dvd rom... It's full of decals, cards, photos, and mock up maps and case files... incredible. He loved it, I loved it, money well spent! (And nerdy girlfriend points when bought as a gift too!)
B0094WK9GU|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing, that's all that there is to say, this is pretty much a concert set, it's not whole songs which is fine with me cuz I can just download those separately if i want them. It's a great cd for a party or just to listen to, greattness all overrrrr! I love SHM!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It is a great movie that makes you wonder and reflect on life. It is exciting and insightful. The actors are great.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good series that doesn't get boring.  Sometimes, i wish the chapters were shorter because I can't stop reading until I get to the end on the chapter and I need to go to sleep.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|What can you say about one of the greatest lead singers in rock of all time.  His range cannot be matched by anything in today's music.  All the music is run through computers...not like this just pure music.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|if u r a vet or just starting out with paracord knoting this is the book for u. great step by step directions.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I saw this movie with my husband and my two sons (one adult and one teenager). We all love it. It represent the Christian values that our society should cherish. It brought me to tears. Definitely shows how fatherhood should look like. Wow!... and trust and honesty were shown very clear. Every young teenager should see it and we parents should talk more about fatherhood to our boys.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book really opened my eyes to the beliefs of others, and is a very thought provoking story. It is dramatic, humorous and educational, three descriptions that rarely cross paths. A great read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game as does my son and hubby. It is very interesting and keeps me entertained when I am on a break from work.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great App! I wanted a music app that had a volume slider on the play screen. This is the only one I could find. It works great on my Nexus 7. It has all the functionality of the paid apps. Did I mention it's free!
B004GKMV3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was light but heavy at the same time as it covered major life dilemmas. Couldn't put it down once I started!
B00973902K|5.0|I think this is one of the neatest songs I have heard in a long time. I think it was a true show of her talent that she won at the AMA's
B005DN5BE4|3.0|Required to view as an ethics course assignment. Would not recommend to the weak stomached. Horrible treatment of human beings.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  She loves puzzles and combine that with trains and she is in heaven.  She recently had surgery and this app kept her quiet as she recovered.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I have limited experience with smarthpones and am still learning my way around the apps. This cloud drive app helps me to transfer the images I have take with my phone to other devices. That has proven quite useful in creating a database of images for use in my design business.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|seemed to get ridiculously difficult at wave 2. not impossibly so just not much room for practice, skill development, or improvement. fun to play, nice throwback to oldschool games.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I really like the album, even though I only knew a few of the songs. Katy Perry does not disappoint. Amazon mp3 albums tend to be great quality.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Great quality, and &#34;Give Me Love&#34; on the album is an extended version from the one you would find on many music networks.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Received in ample timing. It came as it was described. There were no issues what so ever. Would order again!
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|I'm a &#34;moderate&#34; zombie movie fan.  I like &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;, &#34;Outbreak&#34;, &#34;28 Days Later&#34;, and &#34;I Am Legend&#34; shows/movies.  Not so much the older zombie movies.  Zombieland is a great combination of zombie and comedy!  I mean, it has Bill freakin Murray in it!!!!!!
B004DP9QFS|5.0|I think this is an awesome app.  I use it as my live wallpaper on my ICS Toshiba Thrive tablet.  Seeing the lighted and darkened portions of the globe move across the screen, watching weather develop and move across the oceans and the land and more are an ever-changing  treat.  I really am glad that I've gotten this.
0385344333|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books; this one is especially engrossing. I'm going back to see what books in the series I might have missed!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I downloaded the Edge demo and found that I really liked it.  I hadn't even worked all the way through the demo when I decided to purchase this &#34;Edge Extended.&#34;  I don't regret that I have.  I have no problems controlling the cube on my 10.1 inch Thrive Tablet.  The graphics are incorporated invisibly into the game, in other words I don't say, &#34;Wow&#34; so much that I'm distracted from the game or &#34;Ugh&#34; (at all) and am turned off.<br /><br />This is a well-done game, and I heartily recommend it to you.<br /><br />--Michael
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Really good movie ,fresh and entertaining. I would recommend this movie to enjoy  with the  family..the topic was very well developed.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|so many times we don't know how to just &#34;be&#34; - this book allowed me to realize the Four Agreements is what we all should do moving forward.  If you are reading this book, then you also need a direction in life, some advice, or just something to give you strength...this surely is helpful in all these areas. Quick easy read!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It is an easy book to skip pages because you miss very little of the plot. My wife read it first and I wondered how she finished it in one day but when I picked it up I also found it easy to skim. There is a lot of filler which Grisham needed to fatten the book up enough to sell. It is well written as are all of his books but the plot is a yawner.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|If you liked Natural Born Killers - sex, drugs, rock n roll, violence, you'll love this movie.  If not, you'll probably hate this crazy intense sexy bloody trip.
0545101417|5.0|I listened to book#1 and #2 during my commute. Really enjoyed book #2 and can't wait to get the final book #3 that is on the way.
075669812X|5.0|My 9 year loves this! He is a Lego fanatic. He loves to build and rebuild with his own ideas.
0545101425|5.0|Book #1 was terrific and also just finished book #2.  Onward to book #3.  Really enjoying this series on my daily commute.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Whereas this is an excellent film... The product as supplied by Amazon would not play on my DVD player for some as yet un-fathomable reason. It played fine on a laptop, which ment that we had to &#34;sit close to the fire&#34; in order to see the often lost action. I only hope that the time/space continuim warps so that we can watch TinTin on the big screen TV.
0793542049|5.0|Through the years, I have received many positive comments about my &#34;walking&#34; bass. Wanting to pass this information on to my bass-playing granddaughter (12), I was pleased that the Friedland book was a concise, accurate, and well organized set of ideas.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this story it really kept me thinking. I would highly recommend, the characters are well drawn you will love most of them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is full of non-stop action, and is just keeping me on the edge of my seat.  I can't get enough of this show, and Season 3 has not dissappointed at all!!  Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love Minecraft and have it on my Mac Airbook.  It is a little challenging to work on a Droid, however.  And like all games on the phone, they do tend to run the battery pretty hard.<br /><br />I find that I don't use it much, preferring the larger screen of the laptop and greater ability to control and move that a laptop affords.
B0094U0RJQ|3.0|I'm an avid Dylan fan for the last 20 years and have nearly every album.  I've been through this album three times now and am just not as in love with it as I had hoped.  Admittedly, Dylan has released some things historically that I had to grow to love, but first impressions mean something and this one was just not great.  There are certainly some really good tracks on here starting with the lead off song Duquesne Whistle, but there is just more to dislike than to like.<br /><br />I'm not a music critic and won't propose to make comparisons and critique tracks for you.  If you're a Dylan fan and get him, you might enjoy it.  If you are anti-Dylan because of his voice, this certainly won't finally endear him to you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When you are reading a trilogy as grand and fascinating as this one, you always wonder a little as you begin the final book whether it will both continue and ultimately conclude the story in a satisfying way.  Mockinjay does both very well indeed!!  Great continuation, a page turner on multiple levels, and the ending manages to both surprise and satisfy.<br /><br />I can recommend this book highly.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This movie was a huge disappointment.  The acting was horrible and the characters were unsympathetic.  One of the worst films I have seen in a while.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Most people are, by now, quite familiar with Hunger Games from the movie - which I did not see, preferring always to read the book first and then catch up with the movie after.  In this case I wanted to read all three books, which I have now done, before taking on the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, you never know with a second book whether you will be drawn on through the story in a credible way, or disappointed.  Catching Fire definitely does NOT disappoint.  It takes the story on a completely unexpected journey while furthering the overall business of the trilogy - though you don't know, of course, until you finish book three just how well books two and three will carry off the oh-so-ably done book one.<br /><br />Suffice to say, you will not be disappointed.  And you won't be disappointed in book three either!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this sequel down. I cried three times laughed several more and was totally enraptured by this novel. Can't wait to read number 3.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|not entertaining and rather boring. good for 4-8 year old children. antiquated graphics. don't spend the time downloading it. upside - it works fine.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really love this app. I purchased a polaroid android tablet . There was no reader installed. There were so many to choose from, I didn't have a clue where to start. Now, I'm no geek, so it had to be easy. I figured I'd try the android Kindle because it came standard in so many e-readers it would likely be easy to figure out. Turns out--I was right. I love it. It's so easy to operate my kids can do it. Even I can do it. Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle. Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for--a portable library. It's so easy to go to amazon, find my book, download it and read. The selection is great, and the prices are way better than say-- driving to a big bookseller to search for and buy a paper ( save the trees) book.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I have always been a fan of Carrie's but this album is a cut above.  I really enjoy this album, especially the title song.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is the first time I had ever played an Angry Birds game. I actually got it for my Grandson to play on car trips and in waiting rooms, grocery store trips, etc. He loves it. So-- of course I had to see for myself what could be so great, it kept a six year old totally entranced for hours. Now I'm hooked, too. This is possibly the best deal on a game I've ever gotten. I know you can get free versions with ads, but-- I hate commercials and it's worth a few bucks not to have them. This game is worth every cent.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|This might be Rih's best album since Good Girl Gone Bad. Great all around listen. Favorites are &#34;Jump,&#34; &#34;No long allowed,&#34; and &#34;nobody's business&#34;
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong and have many forms of this game on all my electronics. This one was actually free. Some of the games I paid well to get--- especially for my PC and game system. This one compares to the one I gave twenty bucks for, so I'm pretty happy with it. I like the symbols this one uses, they are easy to see. The layouts are challenging enough, but not impossibly difficult. The game can be played quickly enough that if you only have a little time to play, you can still complete a game. If you've never played Mahjong, it's a bit like concentration with strategy. It is entertaining and in this case-- free. I highly recommend it.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|Its a great movie ending a good series. Looking forward to the remake of the first movie coming out next year.
B0068ZGHQM|5.0|I don't watch TV so this was a surprise, kinda sick sometimes but still fun. Getting to see all the episodes in order makes it feel like a top notch horror movie... a really long one. The quality of TV shows must have improved greatly since I last watched TV because this one is very well done.
0446547573|1.0|As with all Nicholas Sparks books, this one is drippy and unimaginative. The diaglogue is bland at best and repetitive. There is a 'twist' at the end that made me want to throw this book out of my window. The only interesting character is Kevin. It would've been really interesting to read an entire book from his perspective. The climax at the end is ridiculous and waaaaay too long. In addition, there isn't a lot of resolution at the end of the book. There are 100 questions that go unanswered at the end. All in all, not worth your time or money, but I'll probably download the movie...illegally, because there's no way in hell I'm paying to see that either.
B005CFWO0C|2.0|I had bought  Patricia's which were great  and bought these thinking they were the same but ran much smaller. Color was pretty but they are going Back.  Also these don't have the little silver crocs emblem which I liked on the Patricia's.  made these look cheaper.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is absolutely the ultimate superhero movie.  And the banter between the action scenes is hilarious.  Mr. Downey Jr. is at his best.  Love the CGI on the Hulk.  If you enjoy the genre you must see this movie.
030746363X|5.0|I read this book, and it is great.  It is entertaining to read through even if you don't use every part (such as gaining muscle).  I did only the Slow Carb diet for a few months, and lost 20 lbs.  I'm not on the diet anymore, but have managed to keep the weight off by knowing what foods pack on the pounds easily.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie is certainly entertaining.  I'm not a big fan of the Alien series, and this movie has moments that are clearly pulling from there.  Could have been just a bit more heady for my liking, but I suppose that's not exactly what this movie is about.<br /><br />The CGI is amazing.  Can't say I've seen better.  Definitely want to have a good sound system to watch it.  Helps with the immersion factor.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|it crashes after the movie piece. it is very disappointing . gameloft usually does better than this. either refund the money or fix this bug
B004XGN8W4|5.0|We ordered this device for our 9 year old son that is currently spending quite a bit of time in the hospital while fighting Stage IV cancer. Up until we purchased this device we had been packing his xbox system and a small flat screen tv in a suit case that we take with us so he can play games in his hospital room to help pass the time. When I found this item I was very excited because it's so compact. You can fit the entire Xbox system,controllers and even a few games in this case. The case is pretty hard which is great for protection and makes it very easy to take it anywhere you go. The T.V works great and has a great display. The sound is really good for such a small t.v.! You can buy optional sticker sets so you can customize your case or you can just choose to add your own to give it a bit of style. I have 3 sons ages 9,12 and 16 and they all love this device. I highly recomend it.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|For the first time I feel Amazon mislead us when they advertise the new Kindle with an HD camera when it is a web cam that they will give you a link to download an app so you can take a of picture of yourself . It does not have a rear eye so, in my option, it is not a camera only a webcam.  I am a Kindle lover and still love the product but I have no need for a webcam and the other advancements did not benefit me enough to have traded up from my Kindle Fire . I had already promised my Fire to someone before I received the HD because I was so excited about the camera, and when I realized I didn't get a camera it was to late to return it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book was truly amazing.  The plot and pace of the book was great. I wish it were longer. Hopefully there is more to come.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|great series, love the story. Lots of action and drama. Sometimes I forget that theres lots of nudity in this series because Im so in-tune to the story.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Arnold's autobio reads fast and basically gives a chronological account of his life from childhood upto the present day. For me the most interesting arts were from his childhood and bodybuilding days before he became the moviestar we all know.<br />If you are looking for deep introspection you will be disappointed, but if you are interested in one of the most unusual and successful careers of our time then you should enjoy the read, and the photos.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|5 stars all the way with The Walking dead, yes it has zombies, blood and gore but it also has drama and a great story. Best TV series.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. Worth the price of a movie ticket, so buying it on Amazon is a steal!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have been an NCIS Fan for 2/3 seasons, I enjoy the show and the story line. The Actors are fun!
B0063M22QO|5.0|If you like mahjong this is a good game with lots of options for different skill levels, fun to play
B001DPC4SC|3.0|My rating reflects the sound quality on the Rhino vinyl release. I expected a vinyl release would merit audiophile quality sound. Instead, the life has been sucked out of this otherwise joyful collection of songs, presumably due to an overly aggressive and misguided noise reduction processing of the original tapes. I cannot recommend this Rhino release.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of our favorite shows.  This is quality entertainment, which is hard to come by on television!  Hope there's more to come!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading the book.... love the book and the trilogy. I wish there were more books... easy to read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this game!  The only problem is that I cannot get it out of the hands of my kids!  Love it!  Cannot wait for the update.
0547884591|5.0|Having read both of Tim's prior tomes, I opened the 4 hour chef with the highest of expectations. Truth be told, I am not even very close to finishing his book: I just completed the first recipe in the DOM section -- all I have to say, is that it is awesome. The section on metalearning is, in itself, pretty invaluable -- his approaches are like none other.<br /><br />Having skimmed over a bunch of other parts, the typical it seems as though Ferriss quality is all there and I am pumped to internalize the foundations of cooking great food.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|-wonderful book.  I do not usually like books about war, but Hemingway has such a way with words that you are taken to the middle of each moment. As if you were there. Very impressive.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't stop watching this show!  Characters are well developed, writing is clever, acting is superb. I could have watched episodes one after another for hours on end.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Excellent.  Damian Lewis is as good as he was in Band of Brothers.  Can't wait until the next season is available.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love books being made into movies. Because I like to see my imagenation come to life.I was so glad when this book was going to be made into a movie. This book is a great literary series so I was extremely pleased to see that those who brought this book to life for us made it as closely related to the book as possible. Its great.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Bought The LORAX  for grandchildren - can not rate it until they come for Christmas. The children are very excited as they are<br />crazy to see it.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|it looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing but kind burned your throat and didn't provide a good buzz.<br />B Del Toro was outstanding and is always worth a watch. Story was beyond far fetched.  Kind of like Scar Face for the 2000's and like that film, will appear to be hilarious, campy & pretty much stupid in a few years.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|We love this app so much, we actually bought the full version! My son spends a ton of time  taking care of the sick animals and cleaning up the &#34;mess&#34;! =3
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love my app! Its so easy to operate! it's quick easy and seriously they exact same as being online.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Got this for my granddaughter for her 6th birthday. She is into Barbies and this is great, does not take up the whole room but has enough for her imagination.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|It had the songs I wanted to listen to. The price was within reason and the fact that it was easy to get.
B009AP2G26|2.0|Glee used to be a show featuring a group of unique, talented, and driven high school kids, but, now, it's a show about a group of boring, untalented, and mediocre high school kids that are nothing like the originals.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Easy to find older music that is not from recycled music store. Has the songs I wanted but would have preferred viinyl
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Action & Comedy all in one. Great Movie! All the great badass actors in one movie. As good as the first one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am very sad that I have finally completed the trilogy. I loved this series. I thought it was very charming, young and fresh, enticing and overall, lovely. I was happy to see how everything played out. You can't go wrong with the \\"happily ever after\\" for a girl like me!<br /><br />I thought E.L did a great job and I am looking forward to reading more of her works.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and found that my phone was faster however with the new app it is also fast and I do not get the freezing on my Kindle Fire. I am an addicted Pinterest fan so if it doesn't work, I let it be known:-)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG Holy effin Shick!!!!!! I can't think of much else to say as of right now. I'll have to add an update later. What I will say is... READ THIS!!!!!!!!!
1451695195|4.0|Good reading...but was hoping Dr. Alexander wrote more about his OOB experience and shortened surrounding events in the real life.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the second novel I have read from Patrick Rothfuss and I have to mention that his writing style is something that is truly impressive. He uses words and expressions that not only pull one into the story but also leave his characters well portrayed and deep in a way that most authors leave out.<br /><br />If ever there was a pair of Novels that deserved the term &#34;Page-turners&#34; it would be this and it's predecessor &#34;The Name of the Wind: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day One&#34;<br /><br />I read the first book in just under a week, and had to pull myself away from it for nasty things like work and food. The main character is very unique and well thought out on a level that leaves most other characters in most every novel I have ever read just feel hollow. Not enough good can be said about this book. If you are a fan of Fantasy set in a believable, honest and realistic setting, you will not be disappointed. If you have not already read the first book (a requisite to understand the second book) go back and read that first.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip's first CD is a home run! I don't know how many of the songs he penned himself but they are all great.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|A great movie Story well written and acted.Sets were also very good.Only note,Nero killed himself with a dagger,he was killed as shown in Movie.Overall a good movie and wish their were more like it<br />  John P
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This had to have been one of the worst movies of the year! The video quality was great but the movie it self was lacking everything.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this game the day it was released i has revitalized the series because the birds all have new powers to stop the piggies and the piggies also have recieved a new life in the star wars universe with the themed levels and building blocks the level designers used. Highly recommed this game
0439023513|5.0|Best book of the series. I think this book has a great plot. As you read it it just keeps getting better. The end of Mockinjay makes you want to read Catching Fire.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|I wont be buying one next year unless the price drops. It has gone up every year and more than it should.
B000002MUW|5.0|I like Madonna, and this album is no exception.  It's a great mix of styles and showcases her versatility.  Recommended.
B008RZF2I0|3.0|Tommy is very good and mixes well with Kamelot music. But this album is a little subpar to the others, but still enoyable
B00005Y7LD|4.0|Most people will be familiar with Rock the Cradle of Love, his best known song of this album. But he does an admirable cover of a Doors song, as well as a classic oldie that fans will appreciate.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool little fun minigames it is worth downloading. fun to pass time. some are harder then others. go get em.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this a pretty cool game  so far. no problems. yes more games like thesesplease. my frie ds kids love this game so does mom.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|storm of swords I love this book  can't wait to read the other books in this series and as always amazon delivered straight away.<br />thanks amazon your the best.
B000PAAJYW|3.0|A very bizarre watch.  Hard for me to get into, but if you are in the mood for something different it is worth the watch.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy this game it passes the time well. my kids hooked me on it. I don't know why I have to write a review
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Bought this movie for my wife who loves the movie.  I found the price to be very reasonable for a new realease.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie has so many layers to it and describes a world that never existed . . . but I wish it did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than the first.  I couldn't stop reading.  I had to know if Peeta survives.
1451695195|5.0|A fast moving quick read sure to open the heart and mind....very reassuring for those approaching death and their loved ones who may be afraid to lose them.<br />Also of great interest to anyone wondering if the soul survives the death of the body.<br />Also what a model of a loving, supportive family!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This movie is great!  Super cute twist on the tinker bell series.  My kids loved watching the suspense and drama.
B009329ZF2|3.0|OK movie but predictable. Decent action and Special Effects. The loser has the required skills but the wrong attitude until the big bad aliens wake him up.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|good grip and nice touch, however only lasted about 1 year...<br />would buy again<br />although something fragile<br />nice cost benefit
B002RTMXIY|4.0|While the action follows a group of men who encounter a UFO, the main thrust of the story has to do with the way their story is received by their friends and family. Living in a small rural community, the news of the incident spreads rapidly and suspicion falls on the young men who had witnessed the event. Their story meets with immediate skepticism and there is a quick turning against them by the townspeople.<br /><br />This, in turn, triggers their anger at those they had know all of their lives and who now think the worst of them. By and large the movie is well paced and holds the viewers attention as the situation develops and begins to turn bad. There are some rather interesting but frustrating scenes in the alien vessal where one of the young men has been taken.<br /><br />All told it is a fairly adequate telling of the story and provides an evening's entertainment for the Science fiction fan at least.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Class still shows when it comes to watching how the upstairs-clan over-ride the downstairs-clans.  Maggie Smith is at her best which lines and looks that could kill.  The entire cast is very well played and the humor is very, very stylish.  Enjoyed every moment of this series.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I really like the layout and function.  but, it takes way too long to load on my galaxy s3.  not sure why that's happening, but definitely a drawback.  please fix lag.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Shows the roman times as lusty as we have be led to believe.  Enjoyed every minute and recommend watching very carefully or you will miss something.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I was home recovering from chemo and was booored, my sister sent me an invite and have been stuck ever since!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everything from the scenery to the acting to the story is valuable to understanding our lives and what defines us.  Well done.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game...good goals and more easy to get points and extras. addictive but easy to go back to if have to set down.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bought this movie for my wife and it came. Rey fast in great condition no scratches and plays perfect with great picture and sound would recommend this seller
B0092W2GSG|4.0|I have been a fan of Calexico for many years, after a friend played their Feast of Wire CD for me while on a road trip. Ever since I've managed to pick up most of their albums, and they have continued to impress me. I feel this album has a feel more like their older albums, and less like their last two, which were my least favorite by far. After many repeat listens, I would highly recommend this album to any Calexico fan, as I think it stands with their best stuff. If you are new to Calexico, I would still recommend starting with Feast of Wire or Hot Rail.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Every disk in this set is in perfect condition no scratches and all play perfect with a great picture and sound it even came with all the original inserts great seller highly recommend
B007M45PMU|3.0|I felt it has some good (maybe great) songs, but lots of mediocre songs in between. I find myself losing interest every time I try to listen to it straight through.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I personally loved her previous Lights album, however, I find myself virtually unable to listen to it now because Halcyon is leaps and bounds better. I don't know how she did it, but Ellie Goulding totally one-uped herself and she has her work cut out for her if she doesn't want this to be her peak!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It has some awkward moments, but overall is a funny and heart warming story. This is a little bit of a spoiler, but I am really glad there is finally a Disney movie where the female character doesn't end up being saved by or being with Prince Charming in the end.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Highly recommend this movie. Colin Firth was amazing. The movie shows the struggle of Elizabeth II's father (George VI) and the lengths the King went to over come his speech impediment. We enjoy this movie in our home.
B000002GAF|4.0|Always good to hear the drums on this one, as well as all the other great musicians. Of course the vocals are fantastic too
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|To make things simple, it's a very nice album to keep on repeat for those who like subtle electronic and indie music. And with the current price of the album ($3.99) it's definitely a steal. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTIONS FOR THIS GAME TO PICK FROM.  IT ALSO DOWNLOADED VERY QUICKLY.  I WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITHIN MINUTES.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is so adorable, the entire family loves it.  We are all looking forward to another one being made.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|After seeing Part 2 last week at the theatre, I went back to see this part of the story again. I was amazed at what I had missed before. Bella's wedding gown was exquisite! What is so great about Twilight is how you are totally carried away into their world and the love story is so beautiful. I am sad to see it end!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a Lee Child fan and have read all of his books.  His character Jack Reacher<br />is one of the most unique and quirky characters I have encountered in mystery<br />novels.  I'm an avid reader of mysteries and I can't wait for the next new book<br />by Child, Baldacci, Woods. Patterson, Crais and Sandford.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept my attention from start to finish.  I was not familiar with this author but I recommend this book wholeheartedly.
0812417755|5.0|i like this copy... hard cover always looks better. it is a good book though, im glad i got it
B005COO1X6|5.0|Very good, holds the interest.  Stephen King fans will not be disappointed.  I love it when kids get to be heroic.
B007N85POS|1.0|Stopped working 2 days after I downloaded it. Purchased regular AB Rio, and it looks exactly the same as the HD version.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought this book was better than I thought it might be.  It made me want to purchase the 2nd and third books - which I now regret.  I was really sick of them by the time I finished.  So repetitive and unbelievable with never ending mini tragedies and stupid quarrels.  Stop with the first one and be happy.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Ive used the free version and now to find one without ads is awesome. All of you review trolls can get out.
1401216676|5.0|The Joker is my favorite villain in the Batman universe, and to have a somewhat definitive back story to this mysterious character intrigued. Alan Moore does not disappoint and what lacks in action is made up with a powerful and gripping story, aiding with beautiful and detailed artwork. One of the best comics I have ever read; I will definitely treasure this masterpiece, especially since so many Batman arcs have roots in this comic.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over and never tire of it! It's got a great plot and the actors really make it believable with their awesome chemistry! Definitely for the romantic in all of us!
1401207529|5.0|Another excellent origin story for the Batman universe. Now we know how Batman came to be, as well as Gordon and his family and even Catwoman. Frank Miller does an excellent job at weaving everything together and making connections between the characters even before they knew each other in their respective ways. Very immersive and influential to other Batman arcs, this is a must have for all Batman fans, new and old, to really understand why Batman is who he is and why he does what he does, as well as to get in the minds of Gordon and Batman, with further support from Selina Kyle.
6305622914|5.0|Have been watching this movie for years. Never tire of it.  Finally decided needed to have this for my DVD collection. Even saw a Live Production a few years ago..  One of the BEST MOVIES ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very additive and it keeps you playing for hours and its endless fun for everyone it gets harder as you go along and you cant stop playing it is a cool running game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Downloaded the free version to play on my Kindle Fire for times when I am on flights or in a queue and wanting to just kill time.  Ads weren't invasive and hardly noticeable and the game played as well, if not better than all the Angry versions I have on my smartphone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This period piece is exceptional.  Very well done.  The Blu Ray discs are beautiful! I would highly recommend this series to anyone.
B009X01C64|3.0|The Marware Revolve case has it all, a fine-grained, padded leather case, a hand strap, a rotating stand with 3 viewing angles in both portrait & landscape mode, a sleep/wake function, an elastic strap closure and the Fire can be charged when the case is closed. And, it has an elastic band to hold the case closed.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like or need the sleep/wake function but found out that I love this feature. The Fire HD snaps securely into a hard plastic enclosure. I'd rather secure my Fire in a leather pouch, but Marware's hard plastic enclosure has proven to be more secure than I imagined. I love using the hand strap when I hold my smaller Kindle Fire HD, but the larger, 8.9\\" Fire, is a slightly more cumbersome for me to hold using the hand strap so I rarely use it.<br /><br />Marware listened to customer complaints about its previous case for Kindle Fire HD. Marware improved this case. You can rotate the 8.9\\" Fire 180 degrees to access the ports which allows you to charge the Fire when the case is  closed. This feature works great. The sleep/wake function also works in this position.  Rotate the Fire back to its original position when it's charged to protect the ports.<br /><br />5 Stars<br />Great case, with great features & several color selections.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I was walking around with the case folded back, my Fire HD in landscape position & the Fire fell forward. I'm not sure how to describe this, but it looked & felt as though the Fire was free falling out of the case & was within a fraction of an inch from hitting the counter -- But it was still attached to the case by the plastic frame and the piece that allows the Fire to rotate. Thankfully it  missed the counter. This has happened to me on more than one occasion and has also happened when other family members have been using my Fire. I hope that Marware can address this problem in future cases.  In the mean time, I've attached a piece of Velcro to the case & the piece that rotates. (A photo has been uploaded showing my solution. In comments below, I mentioned that I had to secure the Velcro with carpet tape)<br /><br />Another solution would be to hold the case in portrait position if there's a chance that the freefall/flopping issue might cause a problem. The freefall issue doesn't happen when the case is folded back & used in portrait position. Also, when the case is used in an angled position, you won't experience this problem.<br /><br />I removed 2 stars because of this(A photo has been uploaded showing my solution.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|Like Demille's fast paced style of writing and well researched material on the material.Would recommend The Panther to at least two or three friends.
B007MG360G|1.0|I bought this game thinking it would be challenging like doodle god. Well guess what? I was wrong. I finnished it the night I bought it. No mini games to play on the side when you are done.  It is a total waste of money!  Do not buy this app!
B000FGGE68|5.0|I caught this movie by accident on cable and could not believe I had never seen it.  I had to have it on DVD.  Amazon had the lowest price and I received it very quickly.  I am happy now.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This is the first album I've ever purchased from an AI contestant. This new album by Phillip Phillips is well made, with some nice raw pieces, some overproduced pieces and many just right pieces. It appears he had a great deal of say in what to play and how to record this album, and that's a serious positive from AI peeps. I'm sure he'll continues to develop his writing skills as he's destined to be making music for a while. I've listened to this album at least 4 times, finding much to like and continue to enjoy and some to skip. Just personal taste. BTW, my wife wished for Volcano to be done here in a full version as that was the first piece she 'loved' by him.
B005723JSQ|3.0|This book is categorized as a light, easy read. I enjoy these types in-between deeper, more emotional novels.<br />The book contains a cute story line with a very predictible ending however.<br />My only criticism for this book, read on a Kindle, would be that the footnotes included throughout the entire chapter can only be found at the very end of the chapter. I was a little annoyed with going back and forth from current page to the end of chapter.<br />I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's books as they take away some of the negative and violent of the every day life and they keep the heart young and hopeful.
B005USZML4|3.0|Have not finished it yet. Please ask me in about three more months.  I have had no time for reading during the holidays.  Thank you
030788743X|3.0|I know this book was supposed to be fun, but I thought it was too silly and pretty predictable for me to really enjoy it.  There are a lot of cool 80's elements brought up in the book, and that's as far as they go...simply being mentioned and not really utilized.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad read, since I quickly read through it, because it was paced well.  But at the end, I was a little underwhelmed.<br /><br />There were also some minor social commentaries that were made, that I though were unnecessary. Also, being from Texas, I found these comments to be the typical Austinite attitude, which is kind of played out.<br /><br />Definitely a borrow, but not a buy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app soooooo much. and i play it every single night!!! my younger siblings play it all the time also..
B00932A2MC|3.0|Ok movie if you want some easy entertainment and a fast action pace movie. A little bit fake but hey it's all sci-fi action what can you expect
B0063IH60K|1.0|The product is only about solicitation and gathering your persinal information which is in really bad taste!! Don‘t be fooled into downloading this!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Perfect movie for the holidays with your kids and family. Have never read the book but after watching the movie I can't wait to read the book to little ones.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|From the information that I studied before I ordered the Kindle Fire 8.9 tablet, I expected a great product. Unfortunately, that is not true at this time. The Facebook app will only show 10 or so posts and then just sits and spins. Basically, the only thing I have used it for is Words with Friends, the weather, and ESPN football. I noticed in the comment area that many people have complained about the Facebook app, but it hasn't been fixed yet. Why hasn't it been fixed?
1451627297|2.0|I have to question if this book is really indeed written by the same Stephen King that used to require TP (toilet paper) as a standard accessory while reading any of his books or moves.  It's not all it's, \\"chucked\\" up to be and eating a burger at the Denny's Restaurant in Bangor would be more exciting!
B004CEUEWE|4.0|This was a thoroughly entertaining movie with lots of action and good acting. I recommend it if you're looking for something entertaining to watch.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Love this series. It's suspenseful, dramatic edge of your seat.  Highly recommend.<br />I find myself counting down to Wednesday now.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I've just started this game and so far it's interesting and fun.  if i could've waited before posting I probably might have given it 5 stars!!<br />I've alreadyy purchased the next one!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good movie, Excellent storyline and good quality video..Family friendly and my kids absolutely loved this movie. Definitely worth the price...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love it. Great game. I have been playing it for a few months now. Easy to play and entertaining.  Give it a try!  Definitely recommend it!
B007D15N1K|4.0|This book is so hard to read if you try to get into the poetry, the Latin and mythological references. So I suggest if you struggle with it, skim the difficult bits on the first read through.  The mystery is really good.  Then I recommend you go back and re-read it again, seeking out an understanding of the difficult stuff.  Worth the time. The author must have an amazing retentive mind, we're lucky she likes to share.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Clesr crisp music and a different more aggresive side of them u may not have seem before. Cool songs yeah
B00571F26Y|4.0|A lot that is said in this book rings true for me.  I think the information and explanations are very helpful although I would say that all nutrition must be weighed up with one's personal needs and a balanced view gained from a broader knowledge on the subject.  The book is well written and is enhanced by access to a website and blog.  Worth the read.  Good recipes too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book!  Wool is a very well written book, which is lacking in today's modern literature.<br />  The only problem I have with the book is that by the middle of book 4 foul language is splattered throughout the remainder of the story.  The swear words didn't add to the plot or the feel of the story, but it was distracting.  It almost felt like the author sold himself short by dumbing down his writting in the hopes of appealing to a wider crowd.  His writting is so rich and absorbing that he doesn't need to lower standards in order to have a strong following.  Hugh Howey shows from the start that he possesses a dense vocabulary, so I found it disappointing that he resorted to such a base use of words.<br />  If his other books hold the same quality without the profanity, I will consider him among my favorite authors.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This game is ultra fun. Nothing like alien shoot 'em up blasty goodness. Easy to pick up but we'll see about mastery.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I saw Nev Shulman on The Jeff Probst Show talking about this documentary which intrigued me enough to want to see it. I loved it - but the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I'm not sure I would have been able to follow it as well if I hadn't heard many of the details on Jeff's Show.
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game for the kids and adults that have a little extra time ! The only problems is prying my phone from her once she gets started:)
1451695195|5.0|This book is well written, held my interest, and introduced some new NDE information. Dr. Alexander offers logical explanations as to why this experience is not a product of the mind.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Completely and thoroughly researched, Goodwin has given us the ultimate story of Lincoln and his Cabinet. A must read for all Civil War buffs, presidential historians, or anyone who wants to know how truly great leaders respond in times of crisis.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This book is one for those of you who enjot your Fantasy more grim, gritty, and most of all, GREY, as no-onw in this world is what could be called 'good'. Those few that are quickly become dragged down into the muck of intrigue and are either destroyed or learn what they have to do to survive.<br />This may sound a bit depressing, but what struck me most is how downright funny the book is - especially the internal monologues of the torturer Glokta had me snorting milk through my nose a fair few times.<br /><br />Another huge plus, at least for me, is that the trilogy is finished; no waiting around for years to find out how it all ends. Abercrombie has however written three more stand-alone books set in the same universe, with some characters returning, so if you enjoy this there're five more books to look forward to!<br /><br />If you enjoyed George RR Martin or Steven Erikson, or you want a more nuanced universe than your Lords of the Rings or Wheels of Time, look no further.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It works wonderfully and tells me how long I should charge and how long I can browse the Internet until the battery goes dead. Though whenever I plug on the charger it pulls the app up which can be annoying if you are in the middle of something - like a video or game.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I really like this version of Emma. I bought it for my mom for mother's day and she loves it.
B009K45Y62|5.0|What a great end to this awesome trilogy. I found myself feeling sympathetic for the Batman, but at the same time fell in love with Bane. I had to rewatch Batman Begins to fill in a lot of questions I still had when the movie ended and it made the 3rd installment that much more enjoyable. I can't wait for this Blu-Ray to drop so I can watch it again.<br /><br />With all that said, I really want that Limited Edition Bat Cowl. I'm looking forward to a Blu-Ray/DVD combo. I don't care for the digital copy. I'll just rip the DVD to watch on my portables (Nexus 7, Galaxy Nexus, iPad, flash drive).
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Well acted. Great story with lots of excitement even though most of the facts of World War II are known.
B009UMTMKS|2.0|It should be much shorter: you'll get the same ideas out of it. I had a hard time to get &#34;hooked&#34; to it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Everyone wants to be loved, and this movie shows how being loved, can change a person for the better.  Feel good movie!
1932100660|5.0|I chose to give this book 5 stars because I felt it was a comprehensive study, well done and very motivating.  It also lets us know that we are responsible for our own health and not to believe all the hype put out by food giants and media...personal research is a must!!  This book goes a long ways in helping us know the importance of personal responsibility and research.
0345803485|5.0|This book is considered one of the popular books to read and I was able to go to Amazon and get a copy.  The book was delivered timely and in great condition.  Thank you!

054537409X|5.0|After seeing the movie, I was curious about the series, so I ordered it.And I am glad I did, it was hard to put them down, I could see why this was so popular. I enjoy young adult books, they are easy reading and relaxing.<br />I am looking forward to the other movies.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was really excited about reading JK Rowling's first novel for adults.  As a huge Harry Potter fan I was sure this book would live up to the standard set by that book series.  I was seriously disappointed.  \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" was unremittingly dark and depressing.  There was exactly one sympathetic character in the entire 500+ pages and she was killed off at the end.  Should I consider buying one of her books in the future I will buy a print copy so I can return it if it is of similarly poor quality.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|So Funny! I really enjoyed it with my girlfriend. We couldn't stop laughing. Must see this movie. Five out of five stars.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|My first concert was June 3rd, 1977 Tampa Stadium for Led Zeppelin. I got 3 or 4 songs and a huge dose of tear gas!  This was the Riot show in Florida!<br />Well I never got to see Led Zep again. Of course the DVD's are part of my collection and all the vinyl, CD's and music are dear to my life.<br />This friends is an awesome show and may be the last full show we see from the Hammer of the Gods. This concert has been a long time coming, but worth the wait. Sure the guys are older now and maybe can't hit every note they did in the day, but hey, this is a hell of a show. Be sure and get yourself ready for a special evening. Put in the DVD and enjoy it to the brim.<br />For a Zep fan It dont get much better!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had heard so much about this series that I was really anxious to see it. I am so glad I oredered the original UK version as I heard it was better than the US televised version. I was not disappointed. It was superb. Huge fan. Can't wait for season 3
B008SOS63S|5.0|Bonamassa ranks up there with the greatest blues men.  His picking will send chills down your spine.  So will his voice.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Superb casting and a more than viable script make this a story dear to me and I would think close to the heart of anyone near retirement age. The interpersonal relationships are delicately balanced with strength and insight.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|Its the twist at the end.  Its not her usual type of twist and although I had suspected what the end might be, its how she writes it out and tells the story that remains a surprize.
1400082773|2.0|Purchased as I was curious about this guy and what kind of person he might really be,  and the book was cheap. However this book made me very uneasy about having this man as our president.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Always look forward to David Baldacci's books. Never fail to make me burn through the pages. This book is no exception.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It puts me to sleep every night. It never has gaps or stops. I also listen to it while reading at night.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest. I'm ridiculously addicted and I rarely have problems with this app. I use it everyday and every now and then it will freeze up but nothing too serious.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, I truly did.  It stands to reason that I would not have bought the second and third books if I did not enjoy the first book.  As a fantasy it is quite good, and the sex scenes are very evocative.  (Often to the point that I wished I were 30 years younger)  That having been said; as a 58 year old woman, I am far too pragmatic to buy into it, as have so many younger women.<br /><br />Let's start with the premise of the 22 year old virgin.  Yes I know they exist, however, I find it a little tough to believe that someone who looks like Ana left home to go to school, and then made it through four years of college with her virginity intact.  That ranks right up there with believing in Santa.<br /><br />2. In a perfect world, everyone would always climax at the same time; in reality, not so much.  I don't care how loud he yells my name.<br /><br />3. If a man is that good at sex, chances are he will not be a handsome billionaire.  Billionaires are too busy raping the environment and squashing the little guy to think about developing their sexual skills, and they look like Donald Trump.  He will be a handsome bartender or a ski instructor, and expect you to pay for lunch.  People seldom come in a deluxe package.<br /><br />4. After Ana and Christian move in together, they start having sex 2-5 times a day, EVERY day.  Even at my peak, I could have handled maybe three weeks of that before I started looking for a second job, just to keep from going home.  I have nothing against a healthy sex life, but you should still be able to walk a straight line at the end of the day.<br /><br />Despite my jaded tone, Fifty Shades of Grey is still a great read, and I recommend it to everyone out there who wishes to keep the dream alive.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter just loved it! Disney does not disappoint!!  So cute and Tinker has a sister!!! awww too cute and very entertaining!

0060974176|5.0|The Machine That Changed the World arrived on time and was new, as posted.  It is one historical perspective and exposes the reader to what they may have taken for granted.
044024367X|4.0|I've read most of the Lee Child Jack Reacher books and I've thoroughly enjoyed them.  This, in my opinion, is not his best.  it certainly didn't keep me on the edge of my chair, but I don't agree with many of the other reviews that it was boring.  It just wasn't as exciting as many of his others.<br /><br />I find it amusing that Child makes such a big deal about Reacher owning only the clothing on his back, an ATM card,  and a folded toothbrush.  In this book, as in others, he has Reacher buying cheap new clothing when he's worn his current clothing out, or long enough that they probably smell - even though Reacher keeps his body clean (a point Child also makes in the book. He even has Reacher going without underwear because he's been wearing them for so long.<br /><br />Points and Chapters:<br />He bought new clothing, stiff and new in Chapter 25. In chapter 41 he takes a shower.  Child mentions that Reacher keeps his body immaculately clean even if not his clothing. In Chapter 48, he buys more clothing from a hardware store. In Chapter 52 he ditches his underwear. In Chapter 68, he takes stock of himself after falling from the wall and sees no physical damage, beyond mud and grease and oil all over his clothes from the sticky earth.  Ewww[...]  I can't find where he might have bought more clothing.<br /><br />He and Vaughan get out of the compound and get into a car.  I can only imagine what the mud, oil, and wet did  to the seat covers.  Even the paper in Reacher's pocket is soggy. They then go into Despair to use the telephone. They detonate the bomb and watch the fireworks.  By the middle of the afternoon they're sitting outside a dry goods store with nothing more to do so they head back to Vaughan's house and shower and dress again. What does Reacher put on? Did I miss the part where he went shopping again?  Were we supposed to infer that since they were sitting outside a dry goods store he went inside and bought new clothing?  Did he also buy new underwear?<br /><br />I agree that this whole point is a trivial one  and that it doesn't make or break the story, and I'm really poking fun at it...mostly. But with all the time Lee Child spends on description, sometimes to a fault, this should not have been overlooked. Child always makes such a big deal about  Reacher's clothing, then at the end of this book leaves it up to the reader to assume he bought new clothes before taking a shower at Vaughan's house.  Nowhere is it mentioned that he throws away the old stuff either.  He then lets Reacher leave town in muddy, oily--probably smelly clothing...clean body, though.<br /><br /> Yeah, I know Reacher isn't supposed to care, but...really?  This was a bit much.
1559944323|5.0|Your Erroneous Zones arrived on time and new, as posted.  This was my second pass having read it years ago.  It is good for discussion in general, but I found it particularly useful with having cross gender discussions with my daughter and my mother-in-law.  Having both a male and a female participant in on the discussion raises many interpretation challenges that help in everyone's understanding.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. my younger brother originally downloaded it, but once I tried it I became obsessed. it is a fun way to escape your rather chaotic life. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and genders.
B0094GW6YE|3.0|Well here we are again.  The promise of a heavier sounding KISS album than ever before and once again, I am dissappointed.  I AM A KISS FAN but let's face it.  I think KISS is done.  I can not find one song on Monster that is worthy of me blasting through my subwoofers!  To any beginner KISS fans out there....stick with the pre-1980 albums and you'll be just fine.  If Paul Stanley could just write another Detroit Rock City or Love Gun song, I would be happy.  Now Paul's recent solo album has several excellent songs on there.  A few rocking tunes plus a few ballards.  None of this appears on Monster.  For me, Monster is just as good as any other KISS album released in the last few albums.  Stop at the album Revenge and you'll hear some kick ass tunes.  Other than that, do like me and purchase Monster, don't open it, put it on a shelf and maybe in 40 years it might be worth something.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|The game load great on my motorol xoom but the controls were very flaky. I had to do where gyro type tilt to get the ship to move side ways. And it always seemed to want to move go the left no matter what i tried.
B000TENKV8|3.0|I bought this after hearing 'Into Dust' on 666 Park Avenue and reading the reviews on here. I listened to the whole collection and it's just not my sort of thing. Some of it was rather unpleasant.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Although I read one book (this one) about Cancer, it is the best. Dr. Mukherjee's narration was really good. All oncologists must read this book. I bet one can learn more from those narrative books rather than text books. Good one and highly recommend for those who are suffering through this unbearable disease. I felt like I lived through a cancer patient's life while reading this book.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I thought the subject matter was realistic and the human side of prosecutors is something you dont see much of.<br />i hope he writes another.
1608871452|5.0|I just got this book today and was totally blown away as soon as I opened it. It's very interesting and entertaining. Lots of beautiful color photos and very informative seasonal chapters loaded with removable surprises(personally I'm keeping the book intact). Any Supernatural fan is going to really enjoy adding this to their collection. I know I am. A very well done book!
B006VREHRS|5.0|totally the best show on today. The authenticity of the script, the scenery nad wardrobe as well as the history are unparalleled
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Another page turner. I wish all cops were as good as Harry Bosch!! Always spot on and looking for the bad guy but very thorough with his investigation. Another great book.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The streaming sucks, we have not had these problems when streaming through itunes. The show itself is excellent! I am only through the first half but it is very addicting.
B0041IPE2Q|5.0|Anyone interested in &#34;unusual&#34; folks music - this is a must-have. You can judge his lyrics, voice, guitar, and arrangements for yourself, but there really isn't anything out there quite like it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Truly enjoyed both books and am looking forward to Book Three. Do you have any idea when it will come out?
0547884591|5.0|I'm a fan of everything Tim Ferris does, this latest magnum opus is no exception.  Although I'm roughly 25% of the way through the tome, I truly feel like I've received my money's worth.  This will clearly be a text that I will read and reread for years to come as I use it as a reference guide to all things learning.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I ordered this to use when hand holding my go-pro hero 2.  I love it.  With this item it's much easier to hold the camera steady for handheld shots and perfect for setting the camera down quickly anywhere with having to mess with a tripod.<br /><br />Need to pack it carefully when traveling as I could easily envision an airline snapping it through rough handling because of plastic construction.  But for the money this is a great purchase!

0812452240|5.0|My 15 year old has been in love with Stephen King books for years now. This is the one he has always wanted, but we've been unable to find, even in the library! I gave &#34;it&#34; to him as an early Christmas gift and he is loving &#34;it&#34;! Excuse the pun....<br />Quality is also good, thanks Amazon!
B000TERIW0|4.0|There was a time that I thought of Steve Hackett as the least important member of Genesis, but a guitarist that I liked and respected. After his departure, Genesis continued along the path of success; Hackett not so much. I loved this album when it was released, and I was excited to listen again. Not only was I pleased with the memories; the structure and inventiveness of these songs has led me to reassess my view of his importance in early Genesis albums. I fully endorse this great collection of prog gems!
0425263916|3.0|i like the book dont get me wrong but when u read the first one ur thinkin the next is goin to be so much better...i would still tell people to read it. i really thought she would have stepped up her game once fifty shades hit like it did..when i first heard about this book they told me it was like fifty shades  the first one as great but if the third book isnt great i dont know alot of people that will hang in there with the books...i just think it could have been better but im waitin for the next one
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who loves to read fantasy books this book includes love, deceit, hatred, and so much backstabbing and twists, it's hard to put down.

B008V1IR4Q|5.0|Understand Mr Wyman's tepid reaction to the packaging, but for $2 and change<br />per disc, whqt can you expect?  The booklet as described sounds quite adequate, if a bit less convenient than having info on the box and sleeves.<br />Just keep the booklet handy, grin and bear it, and wallow in Cortot.  I'll be<br />back when I've heard the discs.  Watch this space.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great series - I'm dying for more! Really interesting, creative story and I totally fell in love with the characters. Please, write more!!!
1936608618|2.0|would really like to give it a 2.5/5, but all 2.5 comes from the layout and presentation.<br /><br />the main reason i give this 2 stars is that this is a plan for general fitness and will not help you sent PR's at the longer races and has some bad information.<br /><br />pros:<br />- The layout and presentation of this book is fantastic and among the best I've seen for instructional books.  Each section has a color-coded tab you can easily flip to.  Then there are many photos taken from different angles to supplement the text.  In terms of fitness books, the layout/presentation of this book is the best I've seen.<br />- The mobility section is a must read in terms of content.  Can't wait for K.Star's book to come out.<br />- mid-line stabilization discussion is right on.<br />- section on hydration is a must read.<br /><br />cons: (note - i'm not a biker or swimmer so my review does not include critiques on those sections)<br />- in terms of form, this book clearly prescribes doing several exercises at best sub-optimally, at worst incorrectly. for example the bench press and deadlift.  so i was interested to see if this bad form was a cross-fit thing and went to the main CrossFit exercise demo website and found this book does not follow what even CF says in terms of setup and form with these exercises.  As these are two of the big-3 lifts and they couldn't seem to get them right, I read through the rest of the exercise demo's in the book with a grain of salt.  even if it has the best presentation in the market, what good is an exercise book if it doesn't teach the exercises correctly, even according to its parent organization?<br />- on the internet people claim CFE ignores the benefits of the LSD.  This book clarifies that when elite runners are doing LSD runs they are far more intense than rec. runners out on a easy job.  however  nowhere do they incorporate the mitochondrial benefits of the long distance run.  so it seems they choose not to add the benefits of longer runs but don't say why?  this carries over to other aspects of the plan.  seems like rather than taking what works from 'conventional' plans and adding to it, they do try to create something completely different.<br />-  CF and CFE trains a lot in the anaerobic glycolytic zone.  this is not a compatible training mode for aerobic endurance as it affects the mitochondria negatively.  no wonder mackenzie has had so many DNF since he came out with this.<br />- nutrition: never addresses very valid criticisms of the paleo diet including the fact that many people today can process lactose with no problem.(evolution of the digestive system, for one, lack of longer lives and thus more age-related diseases for hunter gatherers, for two.)<br /><br />in my opinion, a reader should use this book to supplement their overall knowledge of fitness.  do not use it if you want to become a great endurance athlete.
0307592731|5.0|Beautifully written book with a great story. The title says it all, Lost and Found.  The narrative was never preachy or self serving.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, these are the original broadcast scripts without the added material on the DVDs.  So, if you want the extended versions founds on the DVDs, then you might be disappointed in this set.  If you want the original broadcast versions, then I highly recommend it.  The video quality and widescreen presentation are very nice.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this set.  The video is the best that I've seen for this series, and the audio quality is great.  I'm only on the first season so far, and while the video detail isn't at the same level as modern shows, it's definitely better than the DVDs to me.  (I actually like that the video isn't a lot more detailed than when I first saw it.  The original Star Trek series is interesting to watch in HD, but you can tell that the make up job on the actors wasn't intended to be seen in HD.)  I'm also very happy with the audio.  I watched almost the entire original run on a 27\\" TV in stereo, so to watch it on a 50\\" TV and have it look so good and be in surround sound is awesome for me.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the DVDs didn't include the original broadcast versions (even as a viewing option), but that's because I had watched the original broadcasts with friends/family and liked the nostalgia of it.  I own the first two seasons on DVD, but I don't watch them much because of that.  However, for those of you who like the extra material, or who saw the show for the first time on DVD, I totally understand being disappointed that it isn't on the blu-rays.  It would be nice if the blu-rays had the option to watch either version.  For me, though, this release is perfect.<br /><br />As a note, I own the U.K. version.  I bought it from Amazon.co.uk, and as far as I can tell, the discs and video are identical to the U.S. release.  The packaging is a bit different, though.  I mention this because you can sometimes find it quite a bit cheaper there, and I usually get it in Arizona within 10-12 days of them shipping it.<br /><br />(This was updated on 11/27/2012 to try and make it more helpful.)<br /><br />Update 12/17/2012: I've watched the first three seasons so far, and the video and audio quality have stayed the same throughout.  The video isn't as detailed and sharp as current 1080p shows, but it looks great.shipping it.<br /><br />(This was updated on 11/27/2012 to try and make it more helpful.)<br /><br />Update 12/17/2012: I've watched the first three seasons so far, and the video and audio quality have stayed the same throughout.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life was perhaps the most transformative I've ever seen, bringing Big Self perspective -  magnificence, tenderness, wholeness, innocence; appreciative, non-possessive love - to the struggles, extraordinary and ordinary, we as humans face, always with an underpinning of spiritual longing.  Every level -acting-expressing, visual majesty and simplicity, deeply evocative.  I love this film.  I return to it in my heart to remember.
0062127241|4.0|Mr. Townshend must have based his book on diaries he´s been writting since the sixties. This is not a bad thing, as accuracy and eye for details throughout his life must be everywhere in his prose, which is engrossing. However the text does not give all the scoops on his bandmates - Mr Townshed´s relationship with his band mates has plenty of \\"Roger details\\" but does not go deep enough on Keith´s problems & antics nor on John´s life. C´mon,Pete - you should tell us much more about them, they were part of your life for decades....Some inaccuracies also surface - for instance, when he regrets the passing of George Harrison \\"on December 1rst\\" (it was on Nov. 29th). All in all, a good text and an entertaining reading, though.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, I enjoyed Grisham's latest novel.  It's not the best I've ever read from this author, but engrossing.  Don't want to reveal much about the book except to say that nothing is ever as it seems.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Completely satisfied !!! With this streaming experience.I'll definitely be streaming more movies on amazon. Easy to use from my revue.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I read The 4 Hour Chef cover to cover and could not put it down because it is (a) extremely charming and entertaining  (b) not all about cooking, and (c) gives some wonderful advise, for example:<br /><br />I now know that putting the oven at 350(F) is fine, no matter what, in 90% of the cases you can't really go wrong. I also know how to brew the best coffee in the world after the experiences that Tim had with the 2008 world champion barista Stephen Morrisey. But perhaps the biggest secret I learned is to put vinegar in the salad BEFORE the olive oil (otherwise the vinegar sinks to the bottom) a wonderful tip from chef Marco Canora (the brilliant mind behind New York City restaurant Hearth). How did I not think of that?

0375869026|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book for ages 9-12 years old, and then some! The author wrote the book after she saw a little girl with Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS), which is a craniofacial condition, or \\"facial difference.\\" This book is particularly touching for me and my children, since my daughter was born with TCS. The author was intentionally vague about the condition, so as not to call out any particular child, and to allow this book to have broader appeal regarding children born with any physical difference. This very engaging and entertaining story is told from various characters' viewpoints--which makes it quite unique, and very effective in it's gentle, anti-bullying message. This book should be a staple for every 4th-7th Grade ELA teacher, and copies should be readily available in every elementary school and middle school library. And, yes, the title of the book was inspired by Natalie Merchant's beautiful song, Wonder. Note: I bought several copies as teacher gifts.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Originally only bought it for a couple songs, but the album is starting to grow on me as I listen to it more.

0547884591|5.0|I have been following Ferriss since before the 4-Hour Body and I believe this is his best work yet. The 4-Hour Chef is gorgeous, brimming with full-color pictures and interesting side-bars. The recipes are elegant and designed to teach basic culinary skills that, with practice, will add up to an impressive arsenal. If you read only the cooking lessons, this book is well worth the sticker price. But Ferriss adds significantly more, placing his cooking lessons under the umbrella of his learning methodology, useful for everything from language acquisition to wilderness survival skills. I may never want to create a \\"hobo-can\\" stove or catch a pigeon (by hand!), but tips for quick-chilling white wine or creating the perfect campfire are going to be useful at some point.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is excelent. I am not going to review it here because if you haven't seen it yet then shame on you. The blu-ray disc is excellent. The sound is excellent also. I would recommend buying this one for sure.

1423140605|5.0|Another good one by Rick Riordan.  I don't think this guy could write a bad book if he tried.  Readers young and old should love this book and this series as well as the Kane Chronicles.  Rick is one of my fiction favorite writers.
8866131350|5.0|I love this planner, although like others I am disappointed with the new monthly calendar system. But I am happy to overlook that detail since the rest of the planner is perfect. This product is great for those with a busy schedule, the open design allows for multiple entries in each day, and the extra page provided for each week is great for additional details and to do list.<br /><br />I used this planner all through collage, and now have one for my daily life. It functions perfectly for both.
B00136JR2M|5.0|Just get it, it's worth it, yo. Not the most lyrical, but lyrical enough rhymes and probably the best flows of any cyphers are caught on the album.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Slightly expensive but really worth it! This new collector's edition is far superior for quality to the Universal edition from 2011. Sharper picture, better sound and a good bunch of extras. Being in England, this is one of many blu-rays which make me so glad that I bought a 'Zone A' American player for! The tv version on the bonus DVD I thought was awful, as many other fans will but being part of the package and an extra who's gonna complain? Superb.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book kept me reading and wanting to know what was next. I had to buy the second and third book right away to continue with the story line!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie was what I expected.  A lot of vampire killing action.  I like movies I don't have to think about, and this was one of those.  If you are looking for an Abe Lincoln history movie, watch the other Abraham Lincoln movie.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|5-Star movie for sure!! The acting was very good BUT it was the special effects that blew me away.<br />It has many endearng moments and takes the imagination for a ride.<br />A must-see with rewatchability. Everyone should have it in their movie library to enjoy many time over!!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I love this book.  I try to read it every year.  It is always good for quiet get away weekend.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I love this movie!  It's one of my favorite of all the superhero movies!  Robert Downy Jr. is incredible and really funny!
B007JCP8FE|4.0|Very good cd.  I only listened to the album once the whole way through, but I pretty much love every song.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A romantic getaway of sorts.  Still trying to figure out the characters after reading all 3.  Go for it,  this kind of story doesn't come around too often in conventional literature
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Everyone(with the exception of Taylor Kitsch) performed as if they were in a parody of a crime movie.I can take that if everyone is in on the joke, but it appears that Oliver Stone wasn't.Ridiculous script filled with ripped off moments from other films. The voice-over narration especially was an almost exact copy in tone and content of the narration of the much better True Romance.I hope to never see another Blake Lively acting attempt.
B00881PPTO|1.0|I don't understand why it says it costs a dollar when it's a free app, it even says it in the video. So I looked on another store and it says free as well..... I don't get it
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this movie twice at the theater the first week it was out! If you're not a fan of the Super Hero genre, this also probably won't be your &#34;thing&#34; but if you are a super hero fan, this is a must have!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Okay, so I was intrigue from all the talk about this book and finally caved and read it. What a waste of time that was! The writing is juvenile and the author uses very basic language but then will throw in a word that you know she looked up in the thesaurus, which completely jar the reader and ruins the flow (or what there is of flow.) The characters are very 2-dimensional and the plot gets very repetitive. I thought I might be able to get over the writing in the beginning, but by the time you get to sex scenes number 2 and 3 you start to notice a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.<br /><br />I will definitely not bother to pick up books 2 or 3 as I have read much better romantic/sexual novels and have better things to do with my time!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I think this is one of the best CD's from Adele. I downloaded it to my Amazon Kindle and use it alot.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|I miss the series and am glad I can revisit it.  It was one of my favorites.and I hated when it was over.
B009KUANWG|5.0|You just can't beat using a kindle to listen to your music while reading or going to bed. I love AMAZON.com and their products!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Nice game play.  Cool planes.  All you can do is land but that's the name of the app.  Cant think of anything bad about it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|While this is a basic interface that does not recognize multiple user scores, is an engaging and thought provoking game.
0316236535|5.0|I love reading this book to preschoolers.. Especially if I have the felt props to make the monster face. They love putting the face on and off, too.
6305128952|4.0|as far as I'm concerned .... scarlett johannsons best movie .... very well acted movie all around!  I very much enjoy this movie.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Had a hard time accepting and getting into the magical world at the beginning, but like it a lot now and it's hard to put down.
B000059GEH|5.0|this story never gets old ... but the actresses in this movie cannot be duplicated in a &#34;remake!&#34;  this is the best ...
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Good book. Wish she put in more detail into the life she lived after abduction. Recommend to anyone looking for a good read and true story
1451695195|5.0|This book was wonderfully thought provoking! It was very well written! I would recommend it to anyone especially those who contemplate the afterlife or those who simply wish to read a wonderful story of one man's journey in this world.
B006LSZECO|4.0|After hearing my friends rave about this book, I had to read it.  I found myself quickly sucked into the plot and the various twists and turns.  I love how Gillian Flynn turns a phrase so that it feels like you are actually observing the characters up close.  The book was amazing...until the end.  I found the ending totally unsatisfying and a real let down.  I hope when they make it into a movie they do a better job with the ending...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so easy to use and flexible. You can compare two or more versions. You can highlight important passages.
0316228532|5.0|Despite being a devoted fan of the Harry Potter series, I read this book without Potter and friends in mind. I knew this book was intended for adults and that it was supposed to be completely different than her previous books and I went into the story knowing this. That is my first suggestion for potential readers: don't expect Harry, this is a completely different book.<br /><br />That being said, I think this book was wonderful. Rowling did an excellent job building up the characters as regular people you can imagine in your own life. You hated some of the things the characters did, but still accepted them for their flaws. None of the characters were necessarily horrible people, they just weren't without faults. It was a reflection on ordinary life. No character was an idol or perfect... they were people just like your neighbors, local shop owners, high school kids, etc. It also wasn't a book with a happy-ever-after ending, but it was realistic. One thing I don't like in books and movies is the fluffy, happy, unrealistic ending. There was definitely resolution in the end, but it wasn't a fairy tale ending.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with the book and I recommend it to anyone who likes realistic books that discuss social structures and interactions.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Not a great plot but an entertaining movie... I did not like the way the movie it ended, it seemed like there should have been more to the ending.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Her books are so different!  This one is harder to get into than Girl Gone, but equally absorbing.  Not for everyone, though.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Truly wonderful movie. It exemplifies the strength of a determined, independent youth. Classic Disney/Pixar quality. Would have given it 5 stars, but Disney has so many that are better, I couldn't justify it.
1451695187|5.0|This book is extremely helpful in understanding the afterlife. I was touched by Dr. Alexander's courage and honesty in sharing his experiences and healing through writing this book. Very impressive.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset provides great sound quality, top notch voice quality, and is simple to use. Comes with a nifty volume control built in, and a mute function like you would expect. Had these for over two years and still working great.
B008R9H03Q|1.0|The \\"digital copy\\" included with this purchase is BS.  It can only be played and viewed using UltraViolet's proprietary player.  Essentially, worthless.  Fox needs to get in the game and stop with the UltraViolet CRAP.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|I remember watching this movie back when I was youngster. Recently, I found some of the songs on YouTube and was jonsing for some Hercules. Unfortunately, I only had the VHS tape and no VCR to play it! Thank you Amazon!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it's fun. just like playing at a fun center or something like that. hard to get all the colored prizes though.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Pointless film full of ridiculous violence. Who could possibly appreciate this? Why would someone spend time making this movie? Don't waste your money.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have really come to love this band. their sound is so different and unique and Nate's voice is a mixture of Fergie and Jesus.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|Works well enough on my droid x. But gets repetitive very quickly. Lame 8-bit graphics and no option to change controls from tilt to touch causes a loss of one and a half stars. The near impossibility to pass some 'waves' loses another half star.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I had only heard one song from these guys, but I'm very happy I bought the album. They have an outstanding sound.
0547884591|5.0|I consider myself a good cook ( ok maybe a little in the shoemaker category) and this gave me a fresh look at food, organization, and loving life.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great sound as usual on these haunting tunes. This band poor all of their heart and soul into their music and it is appreciated!
0802798225|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  I love the forbidden love part to it.  There are not many stories on gangs, so this was a refreshing change to all the teen drama out there.<br /><br />I would recommend this!
B0045EA1P6|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever purchased. These guys have one of the most unique sounds around and you almost feel as if you're at the theater enjoying a show. Must buy.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Bought this box set for my husband for christmas because he's a blu ray collector.  he loves them!  thanks so much.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I love this game. it is so addictive. u can even dress him up in little hats and stuff. it sooo cute
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was very impressed with the narrative and the eloquency of events and characters. A very different and refreshing perspective from the literature about vampires out there. The historical references and livelihood of characters kept the story getting better and better. A definite must for literature and history bookworms with an excellent look at fantastical creatures, how do we know they are not truly living among us? Thats the quality of writing coming accross... I am currently reading the sequel to this book and cannot wait to see how more adventures unravel.
B001P36OY2|1.0|Bad Script, Bad Acting....<br />He should have stuck to Fast and Furious, he obviously needed the money and that is why he made this one.
1423140605|5.0|I loved this book! Rick rioridan is such a fantastic author, the book was written so skillfully; I couldn't put it down.
B001XUW26Q|3.0|An good movie, but not a great one. Leo obviously did this one just for the money.<br />Hope they did pay him to much.
0525953728|5.0|If anyone has anything negative or degrading to say about our troops after reading this book?  Well done Mr. Owen !!  A must read for every American.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a feel good movie that I recommend to anyone, especially the senior citizens that are finding a hard time living on their retirement.
B00846REIS|1.0|I can't even start this review without rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Immediately felt the connection to FSOG and it was weak, for lack of a better word. Like one of the other posts I read and strongly agreed with, if you read FSOG don't even bother buying this one. I could not have been more disappointed. After I read FSOG, I went to the bookstore at almost midnight to buy the second one and couldn't put it down. This book, I read over the weekend, and found myself actually forgetting some of the events that I read a few pages before it was so boring. Fail.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This DVD is hard to find in South Florida.  I was happy to find and purchase it on Amazon!  It is a gift for my sister-in-law who has been looking for it.  She will be happy and surprised when she gets it!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|This band has a bright future, and since I am required to write more I'll say they are great. Woohoo
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is just a fun, addictive game.  I've spent hours playing already.  My kids love it too.  It's worth every penny ;)
B008B3MZNI|5.0|One of our all time favorite Supertramp LP's. We did view this one for we could not wait. Blue Ray to boot! We rate this a 10 out of 10. Recommend to all Supertramp fans. A must have!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  Just like Jetpack Joyride, I've spent hours playing it.  My kids love it too.  It's a blast.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The first time I went on Pinterest I was on for hours and still not bored. Always something new and exciting to see.  Many great ideas from talented people. Awesome!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I definitely prefer the regular Angry Birds game to this one.  It's not that it isn't fun - it is... I just prefer the original.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The movie itself is fantastic. Epic tale that is both heartwarming and breathtaking. 5 stars for the movie itself.<br />I would give the quality about 2 stars however. I paid the extra money to stream the HD version from Amazon Instant video and it wasn't even close to HD. It was grainy, standard at BEST. Very disappointed Amazon.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett is a masterful storyteller.  He manages to carry the reader through an historical time period by weaving the events into the lives of several families whose members are also interwoven with eachother.<br />This book covers the time period from the second World War to the Cold War, after the unleashing of the Atom Bomb, which devasted Japan and ended the second World War.  I look forward to book three in this trilogy. His characters are fully drawn and come alive, bringing the politics of their diverse international backgrounds to complete this historical tapestry.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I purchased this lavalier mic after reading a lot of the mostly positive reviews here.  I was a bit skeptical seeing how this microphone was on the more inexpensive side, but decided to chance it anyway, again because of the mostly positive reviews I found.<br /><br />When I received the mic I too wondered why there is no battery indicator  on the mic itself seeing that I left it on a number of times running my battery down without realizing it.  The quality was both good and bad.  I tested it out both on my Cannon T3i as well as my kodak zi8 and got he same result both times.  Pretty loud and clear audio, with an audible hiss in the background.  At first I thought it was because I was filming near my computer and it was picking up interference, but no matter where I went that hiss was pretty bad and muffling out the sound.<br /><br />I was able to remove the sound in post production without too much trouble, but not everyone has access to the time nor programs to do this I'm sure.  It would be nice if the hiss wasn't there at all.  Maybe I received a bad one, seeing that many others haven't had this problem, but enough other people seem to as well.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss serves up a hit (once again!) with his new book, The 4-Hour Chef.  Having per-ordered the kindle version last year, I was super excited to download this gem.  Having been a fan of Ferriss from the start, he once again, breaks down a complicated topic into his own brand of shortcuts and gives the reader a chance to become a rock-star.  I have used Tim's techniques over the last few years to simply my life, increase my productivity, travel more frequently, work remotely, get promotions at work, start a small business, lose over 40lbs and now I get the opportunity try my hand at becoming a more effective chef/cook. I have always thought of myself as good in the kitchen, and frequently get compliments from everyone that I cook for, but lacking in my ability to use the correct spices, oils, and techniques to truly set my dishes apart.  This book gives the reader all they need and more... including a blueprint to break the \\"code\\" of any complex task! I am over half-way done with the book so far and have already ordered a hard copy to keep in the kitchen (as well as several tools of the trade mentioned in the book, like the cast-iron dutch oven). For the most readable cookbook out there, buy the 4-Hour Chef and get cookin'!  My only complaint is that I have all of Tim's books signed and was unable to get a signed copy of the book to complete my collection... Cheers!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't mind clicking on the number of stars I rate this at but if I have to write you a review forget it.<br />I don't have time to jerk around with it.
0449014509|5.0|This is for a gift and the person likes the other books in the series as well.  Therefore we rate it as high as the others they already have.
0316174483|5.0|I love the book my grand daughters will have a wonderful time creating new images with this book I am looking forward to giving it to them for Christmas
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Just Mom porn. Written like the author is in the fourth grade and has a poor vocabulary. Don't waste your money
B000HAB4KS|5.0|. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . it was a great movie but the video quality had problems probably because of my internet acting up
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love, love, love this set of short stories!!! I was captured from the very beginning and couldn't put it down!! HIGHLY recommend!!
B00979CS50|5.0|My package came in a excellent timely matter.<br />I would recemend this to any of my friends and family.<br />Awesome!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This case is great! It's everything it says it would be excepts the case makes it harder to use different chargers. With the case on, u have to use the iPhone charger only b/c the opening is narrowed by the Lifeproof case. Other then that I'm super happy with it!
0525952926|5.0|I just loved this book. So impressive, so well written. And amazing how the author combinated the different languages! I'm looking forward to the next book!
B0068287TK|1.0|while the movie came, the book never did so sent it back..the customer service where I bought it was very nice though.
B0098460O4|4.0|I'm glad that Jonathan did not follow Simon Cowell's advice during the season of &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34;  as the sum of both Jonathan and Charlotte is better than each would be alone.  I look forward to hearing more from them in the future!!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The build quality is good and the lights and sounds are enjoyable - it was fun to take to the costume party.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Loved this book. Although very romanticized by the author, it was a beautiful romp thru the 70's and their love for each other, in all its innocence and ambition.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Lets be honest that a band that is essentially tagged as a super-group is unlikely to endure very long. Well their debut was over 2 years ago and \\"Afterglow\\", not including their cd/dvd live set earlier this year, actually represents their 3rd studio recording in less than 2 years. The pace is ridiculous and one would naturally assume that there would be diminishing returns in such prolific recordings. Not the case at all, as \\"Afterglow\\" is just as strong as their prior release \\"Black Country Communion 2\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the tabloids are indicating that all is not well in the BCC camp, with no indication that the album will receive any tour support, largely due to commitments for Joe Bonamassa to promote his own recently released solo album. With the voice and prime architect Glenn Hughes apparently at odds with the lack of touring it remains to be seen whether this will be the last recording from a line up that has connections to Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Dream Theater, UFO and indirectly Led Zeppelin,whose influences ooze through the music. If you enjoy any of the previously mentioned bands then enjoy this gritty classic blues rock sound machine while you can. Compelling and inspiring, BCC is clear evidence that when done right Classic Rock is never unfashionable but rather loud and proud and deserving to be saluted by flying in the face of trends.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Very good read just what you would expect from Rollins. The Doomsday Key was a nice paced book a great continuation of the series.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a big fan of DeMille but this was not one of his best efforts. You knew how it would end ,onced he bought the item in the gift shop. Very  Bland and even Corey's wisecracks  were not very funny.DEMille should get off Corey and find some different venue as he did in Goldcoast and the Gate Keeper.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The sixth season continues where the fifth left off.  The return of Howard Wolowitz from space and his new marriage to Bernadette drive the early epsiodes of the season.  The addition of Stuart (the owner of the Comic Center of Pasadena) to the main cast is welcome (great acting skills and body language/delivery).  Sheldon has a new assistant, Alex, and time will tell how her character develops (possible love interest for Leonard?).  Episode 4 \\"The Re-Entry Minimization\\" is the best of the eight episodes so far, in my opinion.  The games played in a battle of men vs. women is hilarious.  Also this season, we have had a Halloween episode (complete with costumes), another cameo with Stephen Hawking, and the return of \\"Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags\\" w/ special guests Wil Wheaton and Levar Burton.  Excited for the rest of the season of this LOL comedy!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|My young son saved and bought this game with his own money...game worked for an hour, but now it crashes after the opening video and won't play anymore.  I now see this is common.  I will submit a return and request a refund.  Waste of money!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Great holiday music to listen to when entertaining or just enjoying the holiday with family, you will not  be sorry.
B00973902K|5.0|Ended up caving in and downloading this song, and played it quite a few times on my iphone. good job getting stuck in my head!
B000002VMD|5.0|You  do not get tired of this movie, the soundtract is fantastic, may Whitnney RIP. Great movie to watch anytime.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|so hooked on this album.  I've been looping it over and over.<br /> Tip toe is my favorite song so far.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney was one of our greates singers, there will never be aanother Whitney, love it , can listen all day.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book, very moving story! And I truly enjoyed hearing the story from the dogs point of view.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author is a scientist without predisposition to create a fantacy that could make money through book sales, but seems to be an author who is simply trying to tell his experiences which actually are opposite of what he thought prior to his coma.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really like this one. mixed adventure games and hidden object games. awesome graphics and scarey story. hope they make a part 2!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Must read for all ages! Simple, easy to read and full of adventure! Dare I say that this book might be better than the movie?
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book was great...read it after seeing the movie and the movie held true to the book - but of course the book provides a more in depth look at the story.  Very satisfying book to read with kind of a surprise ending.
0547884591|5.0|For anybody who just enjoys learning new things every day, this book is for you. I've been busy with Thanksgiving and such, so have only made it through half the of the META Learning section. No need to worry, though, because I can already tell the entire book is going to be great. The amount of FULL-color illustrations and organization of each sections is nothing short of amazing. Tim makes it quite easy to find exactly what part of the book you would like to read (I myself am going to read cover to cover). First, you will learn how to learn anything in the quickest time. What better skill can you possibly have? Then, he'll go right into a detailed example of that with how to become a world-class chef and food expert in ONLY SIX months.<br /><br />If you're craving the ultimate knowledge and/or tired of Stouffer's out of the freezer, this book is for you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome reading!  Well written.  Enjoying the characters and the writing brings each one to life.  Great value for the money.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie was great (and I'm a full grown adult). It was full of action and it was hilarious. I like movies like this, where women are not waiting for their prince to save them-she was a strong and independent girl. Great for the family!
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|What a terrible movie, boring, two thumbs down, worthless piece of film to own.  I wish I could get the few hours I wasted watching this movie back.
B00064X3FE|5.0|This is one of the best Elton John CD's - would recommend to as a one the last classic Elton John's songs go.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Was a very interesting movie the wife and I enjoyed it and we're old folks the story line reminders me of another story I just can't put my finger on it right now.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Mark Owen isn't going to win the Pulitzer for this novel. His writing is chock full of unimportant and uninteresting details like what he ate for various breakfasts and lunches or itemizing every single piece of equipment he brought with him on every mission. However, his writing provides a pleasing, often humorous, account of the Navy SEAL life, and his description of the raid on the Bin Laden compound in Abottabad was incredibly gripping.
B000V8A95C|5.0|I love love love it..<br />Worth every penny.  I haven't gotten to ref of any song yet. I wish this could be a movie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! I just wish it was on Netflix and I didn't have to pay $2 every episode we watch
B007N5YIUS|1.0|ok this game is horrible it wont even open on my nook tablet after 2 days and turning off the tablet and restarting it. dont get this app until they fix it very disapointed
B009CPE424|5.0|This movie is definitely geared toward children. Good movie but not if you're over 13. My 9 year old loved it
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love this case because it fits me! It has my bold personality and it will never get changed and that's what you need to learn in life is that you are independent and nobody can change you no matter what!!!!!!
B001JU4S44|5.0|I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but I love these movies! They're very action packed but he doesn't make a good pick for a love scene.
6300274195|5.0|I loved this movie and still as an adult I bought it so my daughter can enjoy it as well alot cheaper than a DVD and she cannot scratch a vhs
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Good movie. would buy this movie to watch again! We rented it and watched it three times. &#34;he's so fluffy, I'm gonna die&#34;.
6302212529|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and still as an adult and I have a child of my own and she loves it too alot than a DVD and cannot scratch a vhs
B009X00E18|2.0|I choose this because of how much I like the version I bought for my Kindle Fire.  This one seems cheap and no way worth over $40.  Unlike the one for the Fire where it is fake leather and fits well this is plastic.  It does fit well, but the bi-fold front cover is lame.<br /><br />I was too fast at throwing away the box or I'd return it.<br /><br />Be patient and wait for a better case.<br /><br />John
0767811070|5.0|This movie is classic and I have always loved it very happy to find it here and less expensive than I thought
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|After two weeks product is holding up nicely. Light and durable.  Would buy again.  Seems to be of decent quality.
0307887448|5.0|Read this on a recent trip and thoroughly enjoyed it -- especially as one who grew up in the 80's.  The pop culture references support an engaging plot and strong characters within a world that was highly engaging.  Before leaving for my trip, I started with the audiobook which well read and fantastic.  So much so that I ended up taking a significantly longer way home so that I could hear more of it.<br /><br />One of the best books I've read while traveling in a long time.
0547884591|5.0|First of all, from the start, this book is beautiful.<br />Coming from a photographer its looks great. But I wasn't sure about the content.<br /><br />I started reading and thought Tim would go on these weird tangents like some reviews mention BUT... I don't think they picked up the right book.<br /><br />The book is thorough in every regard, and VERY well organized. Tim explicitly states that this isn't a straight read-through, but more of a choose-your-own-adventure book. If you're a guy in his 20's who hates cooking and recipes, like I do, this is your solution.<br /><br />Good teachers know that to get something across, they have to engage their students and make the material relevant. What more can Tim do than throw amazing images at you with tools and extra's, give you up close and personal tutoring for how he becomes world-class in different areas, and give you a fly-on-the-wall view of the best practices of chefs around the world.<br /><br />Instead of reading like the manual for how to build a washing machine (Like most cook books/recipe guides) , it feels like you're taking a journey that will improve your life not just in the kitchen, but outside as well.<br /><br />PS: The North African Eggs... I'll be making those for the rest of my life.<br /><br />So. Good.<br /><br />-Chase
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This book does live up to book one. I hope book three lives up to my expectations of Ken Follett. He is a master writer
B006ZNRD06|2.0|This &quot;free&quot; app still has audio/video sync issues.  I would think thar ABitNo would have resolved this issue since it has been an issue for more than a year.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had never had any interest in any of these kinds of book. But I kept hearing from friends how great it was. So I gave it a try and couldn't put it down. Loved it. Can't wait to read the second one.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie (The Book of Eli) has the earmarks of a new classic.  I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington and once again, he doesn't disappoint.
B00846REIS|2.0|A really bad imitation of 50 shades of gray.  Not worth it.  50 shades of gray was entertaining from the very beginning.  This one not.
B004J5C2XA|5.0|Any dedicated George Michael fan A MUST HAVE! It feels like he is there in the room with you whilst being interviewed.  Would highly recommend.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|It has all the major action guys of the 80's/90's. Don't give me the &#34; Thin plot, same old story&#34; line. That is how action movies are. Grab a beer and BBQ, turn your brain from &#34;over think&#34; to &#34;Kick A**&#34; and watch stuff blow up, butts get kicked and blood fly.<br />Analyze &#34; The Descendants&#34; . Get some whup a** with Expendables. I hope they make 10 more.
B008F5QQI2|5.0|Thank you to you George Michael for this song.  It expresses volume when an artist can write about a near death experience and show his gratitude to the world for their prayers of healing. The remix versions are great also!  Thank you!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Highly recommended.  This is a nice app to help you relax before going to sleep.... or just have as a background noise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love me some pinterest!  :) i try to use it daily! very easy to use!! highly recommend it! great one!!
B00884GR0W|1.0|IT WONT WORK ON MY KINDLE!!!! IFBIT ONLY WORKS FOR ANDROID I AM MAD!! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|.... Good game. Enjoyed playing the first few levels so far. It asked me to rate the game and I give it 4 stars.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Seriously folks.  This show keeps me glued to my seat.  I just can't get enough.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of the comic books since day 1 and have to say, the 'TV' adaptation is fantastic.  It's pretty amazing how familiar, yet different, everything is between the comic and TV series.  Just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, and enough changes to keep you intrigued.<br />Take 'The Governor' as an example.  His 'TV' version is soooo much better than the comic.  He's charming and smooth, which explains why he became 'governor' of Woodbury, yet still twisted and insane behind closed doors.  Love it.<br /><br />While the TV series is not nearly as 'dark' as the comic, they still manage to keep that same sense of dread and desperation afloat, with that 'glimmer' of hope off in the distance.<br /><br />Season 3 ratchets up the emotional intensity level and action, and will keep you coming back for more, every week.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Perfect. NOT for the squeamish. What more can you say about Walking Dead?? Lots of blood and great sound effects.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I loved the features that the mini series offered and the blu ray made it an increible experience.  I would reccommmend this to family and friends without any reservations.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|As with all the Twilight CD's, I love this one too. There are five movies so there are five CD's.
B008458O3S|5.0|My 14 year old son and I played this together. It was a lot of fun to compare our tracks and collaborate together.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|I missed War Horse when it was in the theatre so I ordered it.  My husband and I liked this movie.  In fact, we used it to entertain our family over the Thanksgiving holiday and will continue to show it to others that come into our home during the Christmas/New Year season.  I didn't give it an &#34;I love it&#34; rating because it is lengthy and a few scenes did not hold our attention.  But overall, this movie is worth seeing and I would recommend it to a friend who loves horses.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Well it has good special effects.<br /><br />Do you seriously believe maybe 10 guys are going to get a WWII Battleship out of what ever shape it was supposedly in and actually get it underway? And it has live ordnance on board to boot!<br /><br />They couldn't do that even if the ship was 100% ready for sea.  Fracking impossible.<br /><br /> Whatever... Total fantasy..
B00114RKT8|5.0|I had not heard of this film till recently, but am glad that I did. The cinematography was incredible. The sets and costumes were fantastic. The actors were perfectly cast. The pace of the story telling was spot on. What a moving historical tale.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a fun game.  it can be slow and freezes sometimes,  but I guess you get what you pay for :) I don't like that if you have to replace the kindle you have to start all over,  as this is a time consuming game. That's the main reason it didn't get five stars.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The imagery and animation were incredible, but I wasn't particularly sold on the story. I don't regret the download and viewing, but I will not be adding a hard copy to the collection.
0307276902|3.0|it wasn't awful. I found that the first 100 pages or so were so repetitive that I wasn't sure if I would ever finish this book, but it was.. okay.
141659521X|5.0|ive read all of his books, i got the audio book for this one and kept finding myself sitting in my driveway listening to it when i should have gone inside 20 minutes ago.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I was not a fan of Pink but always had respect for her. This album changed my opinions. I have become a fan. Worth every penny...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is both a history lesson and a great family saga. Follette does a wonderful job of bringing the families forward from Fall of Giants. And the time period, from 1933 through the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, is a fascinating time. His character development is so brilliant, you feel like you know and can reach out and touch these people.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have never been disappointed with an album from the Deftones and this one is epic. Chino's voice is used at its full potential on this album. Simply beautiful
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is a bit different for this author. But has hints from The Firm. John Grisham is apparently not a big fan of government law enforcement. But a good read with a nice but quite predictable ending.
B001BS3G6A|5.0|If you're looking for quality music, look no further than Melody Gardot.  Every song on this album is top notch!  This sounds even more wonderful as a vinyl than it did as a regular CD, it was meant to be heard this way.  I would recommend this artist to anyone and everyone!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love it.  The best part is that I can listen to music any where in the world; I don't have to be in the United States.  I like the various radio options available.  Great product.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Held my attention like few first efforts.  Has the potential to join some of the big series (Game of Thrones etc.) if the author can follow up.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|didnt have a chance to see all the star wars episodes way back home in my country, but now i can see it with my kids. Im a big fan of star wars. il recomend this  to my friends for sure..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wished that there would be more to read it was great. Please try and write more, it cannot end it to good to end.@
B008011XQQ|5.0|Good album, always good entertainment and guitar work from Carlos. Also knows how to pick the right vocalist for the song.<br />Thanks amigo
B00A135YUW|3.0|But all the songs begin to sound the same after a while. Good for an iTunes genius mix, though. Would love to hear her try jazz - great voice for it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved these books, they were so interesting and fascinating. I loved how the characters interacted, evolved the tender hearts developed.<br />E L James did a wonderful job in writing these books.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Amazon would not show this product on it's list of downloadable items! I really wanted to try this product! Problem with Amazon not product
B009GENZ12|4.0|I guess I was looking for a typical horror plot.  Instead this is a social commentary...sort of, manifested as a horror story, and the result is really something disquieting and scary.  After reading some other reviews I admit I was disinclined to watch it but I'm glad I decided to check it out.  I have to wonder...were we watching the same movie?  It's scary, and surprising, and ultimately thought provoking.  Not earth-shattering, but definitely Good.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but felt this one seemed very disconnected from the original Nanny McPhee. This one seemed more farfetched.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|As I was reading it, I was struck by some of the over-the-top claims.<br /><br />Then I became lost with the poor organization of his collection of random thoughts.<br /><br />I'll confess, I didn't finish it yet, but I was so disappointed as I was reading it, I felt compelled to write the review now (which I will edit when I finish it).<br /><br />I didn't bother to read any of the reviews before I bought it because it was only $5 bucks in kindle format.<br /><br />After reading the comments claiming that they are faked reviews, I suspect they are, which makes me mad.<br /><br />His chapter titles weren't even clear, and if you clicked a hyper-link in the kindle book, good luck figuring out where you were.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book after hearing Tim on the Robb Wolf podcast - seems like a really nice guy, so I'm sad to be writing this.<br /><br />I guess if I were to offer one piece of constructive feedback:  WRITE SEPARATE BOOKS and don't trying to combine a bunch of different books into one book.<br /><br />Mike
B000007MVD|5.0|It's really fab to hear the old songs the Beatles performed and to listen to their insights way back in the day : )
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I am a Disney Geek - so it was almost certain I'd like this movie. But because it wasn't highly rated when it came out, my expectations were a little low. So it was a very pleasant suprise when the movie was so wonderful!<br /><br />The princess is this movie is not the standard Disney princess - and more realistic for that. It was a wonderful way to escape reality for just a little while!
B000ICXQXI|4.0|The movie was just as exciting as I remembered it but unfortunately there were several moments where the video and audio were not synched, and that was rather distracting.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Bought this DVD to familiarize myself with the works of Ayn Rand.  I enjoyed viewing it very much, and I appreciated the allegorical message as much as I did the experience of the journey back to Gary Cooper's time, when my parents were young.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I never get sick of listening to this album. It is AMAZING!!  I can't wait for the new album to come out.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Without analyzing the album track by track I just want to say that for me Rit has been synonymous with the smooth LA sound for more than 30 years. I don't know all his 45 or so recordings but from what I have heard this (as his previous effort Six String Theory) is one of his best offerings. It's great that he is gathering other legends, as well as new talent, around him and making timeless music.<br /><br />I must add that the sound engineering on this CD is superb - a real bliss for an audiophile listener.
B009IAIC5I|2.0|All picture discs sound like garbage. The original, superior sounding black LP's of the first 7 Maiden albums are all very easy to find in used shops, record fairs, online auctions, etc... for much cheaper than this, usually under $15 for ones in great shape.<br /><br />Edit : 5 stars for the music, 2 stars for the disc only because of Riggs' awesome art !
0316228532|3.0|Ok, not as good as the Potter series. I could not get into this book. I found it boring. I would not recommend it.
B0053O89WY|1.0|Anyone who finds this show funny has an abysmal sense of humor. Just absolutely terrible and unfunny in every possible way. I imagine this is what stupid people think a smart comedy is.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app!  I live in a small town, and this app not only provides a forecast for my town but it is right on target!  Love being able to look ahead and also receive alerts specific to my geographic location.  Easy to navigate...easy to understand.
B002N5N4M6|1.0|Just garbage..total, complete, unfunny garbage for stupid people who wouldn't know clever comedy if it hit them in the face.
1593272790|1.0|My kids have tens of thousands of Legos, but the special pieces needed for most of the models in this book are very rare. We all went through the book trying to find buildable models to no avail. We also bought the book that comes with all the needed pieces, and the kids loved that one.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|The bottom line is that The Town is very entertaining, the highlight being the psychotic Jeremy Renner. It's enjoyable as a crime procedural, but I sense Affleck was trying to transcend the crime genre, and for me, he didn't succeed.<br /><br />First my issues:<br /><br />My initial problem with the film is the numerous plot holes and strange character motivations. In the movie, one of Affleck's crime buddies sacrifices himself for his team, yet he is not set up as a self-sacrificing character. Affleck hijacks a police car in broad daylight in the middle of a police investigation, and although Jon Hamm notices, he doesn't think it's strange that a cop car is leaving a brand new crime scene. And how does Affleck get access to buses and all those convenient uniforms? These are some issues I wish were addressed and would have been in a better film.<br /><br />Some scenes are merely expositional, especially the initial scenes between Rebecca Hall and Affleck. They converse about the bank robbery, but we don't see the chemistry build over time. I didn't believe in the relationship because we never saw Blake Lively's character's reaction to Affleck not spending time with her and because Rebecca Hall and Affleck seemed to have gone on six or seven dates before they kissed. Maybe I'm biased, but it seems like that's too long for anyone to wait for a first kiss, especially a Charlestown bankrobber.<br /><br />The action scenes are adequate, but I become wary of any film that features professional policemen missing targets at close range while firing automatic weapons.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br /><br />Jeremy Renner's character brings out the best of the film. You never know when he's going to mess up the situation, and there is one terrific scene where he catches Affleck at lunch with Rebecca Hall. Suspense is built just through a few glances and hand movements. In fact, the movie works best when its being subtle about what's happening. There's another great scene where Jon Hamm threatens Blake Lively with a dollar bill. And another where a cop pretends not to witness a robbery.<br /><br />The Town, like a lot of Boston movies (Good Will Hunting, The Departed) is about changing your way of life. I'm glad Affleck dove into the motivations of a bank robber. He was raised by a bank robber and is in a situation where he is pressured to steal by his peers (and later we find out what the consequences of him not stealing are). The movie builds upon the classic moral dilemma of a man forced to do evil against his will, and like a Greek tragedy, we see the consequences of his best intentions. The Town is a fine film to watch, gripping and entertaining, but at the end, I was left disappointed by the lazy plot, especially because I felt these issues could have been easily cleaned up. I hope Affleck will continue growing as a director; he is certainly a competent one -- he knows how to build suspense and has a flair for picking good subjects, which is the most important skill a filmmaker can have. After all, you can learn how to write or direct better, but you can never learn good taste.
B00A1U2SVS|1.0|This MP3, just out in time for the Christmas rush, will be a terrible mistake to purchase. The sound is uniformly fuzzy as if recorded from way WAY UP in the balcony. Not good.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Kid Rock rocks, as usual. Great mix of  Southern Rock and Rock n Roll.  The guy is so versatile and talented.  It's just friggin great.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|A very nice, light comedy, one of Hugh Grant's best movies ever. I don't want to talk too much about it, since, it'd spoil the movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, funny, emotional, all you can expect from a romantic comedy.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Our family thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It has all of the Christmas magic and some comedy too.  I recommend it for anyone!
B003QWRA3Y|4.0|The quality is good and acting is absolutely great. But it is a sad movie and emotionally complicated. A must see for someone who is a fan of movies, you'll enjoy some absolutely fabulous acting, actually, a breakthrough in drama.
B0013BOS6W|4.0|Good chemistry between the co-stars.  Eckhart is a hottie.  The little girl really adds to the plot and it all revolves around how something good can happen from tragedy
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I always admire Judi Dench and this one was no exception. It's a comedy about some people who happen to all decide to go to India for different reasons and happen to stay together at a hotel which to their surprise is nothing like what was promised in the brochure. They have interesting adventures adjusting to a new culture and end up falling in love with the country - most of them - in different ways. It's a good comedy for a couple of nice hours. Highly Recommended.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was good. It's not like 50 shades of grey, fortunately 50 set the bare pretty high but it's still really good. I thought it was funny that there is also a grey tie in this one too.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I loved this movie because it wraps up the series in an emotional way. the series ,wihich I was not interested in at first but friends had to drag me into, grows darker as it goes despite the premise that it is based on childrens books. last installment of harry potter gave me that sad feeling I had when I was a kid and my father took my sister and I to see Return of the Jedi. An end of an era feeling that makes you wish it weren't over but at the same time a fitting end to a spectacular series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It isn't like 50 shades of grey at all. There are a few similarities, but not enough to make it feel like a knock off of 50.
0788859544|5.0|my daughter has been on a mermaid kick and this sealed the deal . she hasn't stopped watching this since i bout it .
B0098VXBIA|2.0|It wasn't nearly as funny as I'd hoped. The only believable pregnant one was Elizabeth Banks.  The dads were the funniest part of the movie and that's not saying much. JLo and Cameron were lame & lacked any chemistry or depth. Meh. Skip it unless its free and you're totally bored.
B009M5CJI0|3.0|This did not grip me like the first one in the series-&#34;Fall of Giants&#34; -however I will read the final book to see how Century ends. The 3rd one hopefully is as good as the first in this trilogy.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I loved this movie. Very catchy songs but will stay in your head for days. lol. I would recommend it as a great family movie.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Love it!!! While viewing it with others, the conversation piece was that we/I wish that we remember our History a little better...
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best mobile Solitaire game I've had. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it's smooth, responsive, and fun. I'll certainly keep this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It very addictive. I played it all day and finally finished all the levels but there always an update with more level every few months
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Way before it was to be shipped, I was very disappointed when I actually GOT it<br />ANYWAY...So I am not happy with this order, instead I am quite peeved...
B0055B7IPE|3.0|It's ok. I can't say I did or didn't like it. It was funny but not the falling out of my chair funny.
0307270807|5.0|I've read many books by soldiers in the field and was happy to find a new view of the war in Vietnam.  Herr's prose is choppy and descrlptive as if he's taking fire as he writes.  A must read for students and war historians; Dispatches makes me want to delve deeper into many facets of the experience that was and still is Vietnam.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love that the cards are big enough to see. But do not like the pop ups after each game.
030758836X|5.0|A great suspense-filled book that won't allow you to be minimally engaged. Loved it! It has kept several friends up for more than one night. Fast delivery too.
159102594X|5.0|After starting this book due to rave critical reviews that I had read I almost gave up halfway through. I initially disliked most of the characters. I never fully warmed to one of the main characters being a torturer for the inquisition. However as I read further I was sucked in to the multi-layered plot and unique characters. The first book doesn't stand alone as a story as it ends on a cliffhanger, but if you are interested in a fantastic dark fantasy trilogy you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall I found Abercrombie to be the Anti-Tolkien. While on the surface it seems like a classic battle of good against evil it turns out to be anything but. I've only read one of K J Parker's works (Sharps) but if you are a fan of K J Parker I suspect you will enjoy this book, and vice versa if you liked this book you should check out Sharps by K J Parker.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It is about time I have gotten around to watching this show. Why did I wait so long? This show is certainly about war, terrorism and all that but its about much more. Or much more deeper. The characters are so real, I think they may live next door. If I lived in Washington DC. The story line is fast and furious with minimal I saw that coming moments.<br />I ranked it high because I want to rush home right now and keep watching. Anyone who is of average intelligence, has an interest in current events and is not bothered by concentrating a little bit harder than usual, will like this show.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of my favorites, got it because amazon suggested it, love the writing and cant wait for the squeals hope they are coming soon.
0553582038|1.0|Boring until the end. HBO show does these books some justice. Buying book was a good purchase. Fair price and all.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is my first CD of this lady. I have been listening to her at different times and I thought that a best or greatest songs would be added to my collection. i used one of her songs at a 25th Anniversary celebration (16 years ago) to the delight of my guests.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game on my kindle. It's so easy to use and it is an awesome game to play to pass the time
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it I play it like 247 olive this game hope it stays free but I got it so who cares
1881273873|5.0|I found this book so educational. I started trying some of the techniques, and sure enough, they work! I've also been passing it around to my friends so they can gain the same insight. We have all found it very valuable.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was okay.  It had a decent plot, chase, and happy ending.  However, my children are 1.5 and 3yrs. and they were both scared by the large evil bear in this movie.  Most new Disney movies are child friendly but I would not recommend it for children below 5 or 6yrs.  The bears are too realistic in the attacks and may give children nightmares.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This app is really great. It's funny in my opinion and quite challenging. Would recommend to all if you love Angry Birds.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Last year i purchased the MW3 tb deltas they where great only draw back in my opinion at times it you hear  crackle from interference you can get them to get zero interference but at times it was present but the tangos eliminate that unless you go far away from the lil tower but u really have to go far off  Really happy i use them for movies, xbox 360, on cell to answer calls when im online works great  for $300 there still worth it but i found them for $ 270
B0045XICB2|5.0|Loved this one, parts made me question what Bella was doing, but overall can't wait to see the final one, even though I wish there could be more
B008WHTFL8|5.0|I have been a big fan of The Darkness since around '03-'04, and this album certainly doesn't disappoint! While the music is definitely a bit different than what was found on the previous two CDs, it is no less entertaining and enjoyable! I give it two &#34;fumbs&#34; up. ;)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really liked the way this is set up. The different sceneries are great, whether you're down on the planet or up in space. The extra killings outside the plays are a tense relieving plus.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I gave three stars because I found it okay and sometimes I couldn't stop reading but sometimes also I grew tired of the scheming and intrigues and would have liked more information about the world itself
B00913DPW2|2.0|I am stuck on piecing the pictures together and there is no way to skip them. I am aggravated I can't get past this level. It wouldn't be so bad if the picture would just stay the way I set it so I can go clear my head but when I come back its all scrambled again. Aaaaargh!!!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|this phil collins cd was such catchy and made my family be calm and wonderful. thanks for selling this wonderful CD
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great graphics, clever puzzle design, and I like how the incorporated the hidden object scenes into the storyline. I'll play the next one.  Well worth 99 cents.
B00006RAKP|5.0|this elton john cd was wonderful and made my relatives and friends jealous i hope to buy more in the future
B0096I9UTE|4.0|Kylie is my #1. Basics. Obviously as an American, my childhood lacked the major dance hits Miz Minogue was pumping out in the late 80s, early 90s, also, I was too young! I was a better age though, when she blew the US apart with the 'Fever' album. That album takes me back to being 18 and in the clubs every Friday or Saturday night! To make a long story short, after a few more years of flirting with her, I fell heads over heals after picking  up 'UltimateKylie' on a trip to the UK in 2006, and then being blown away by 2007's 'X'. I have basically followed her every move since.<br /><br />I was excited about the \\"Abbey Road Sessions\\" project since the blogs started buzzing about it last year. I heard the K25 and  other online footage and was intrigued by what I heard. How PERFECT would it be that I was able to purchase the album on it's first day of UK release on my most recent trip!?! Lucky me, my copy came with 4 picture postcards that are GORGEOUS! I didn't have time really to listen to it properly while I was there but I will say I was kinda underwhelmed.<br /><br />Let's be real, her vocals, sound amazing! She is on tiptop form, as she always is, and she really shines on a few tracks. There are a few real gems on here that will progress as favorites off this cut. \\"On A Night Light This\\" first off is the biggest highlight for me on this album! I am not so crazy about the original version from 'Light Years' but this version is an absolute BANGER! It's still uptempo, but it's lush with a jazzy orchestral feel. Delightful! Also the new version of \\"The Locomotion\\" is inspired! It hits all the right spots and Kylie sounds like she's really enjoying it. \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" is represented here as a torch song, which isn't new if you've watched some of her tours. I think it shows how this album really works at it's core. Another, \\"Come Into My World\\", a song that I really could take or leave before, has a new energy and I've connected to that song in a different way. \\"Never Too Late\\", one of my fave Kylie tracks, is a stripped down, almost tragic version of the song. I will always go back to the original but I appreciate it's inclusion here. I also quite like 'Flower' but think it was a silly choice as a single, but the video is gorgeous!!<br /><br />One track that she did at 'Proms in the Park' that went off well was 'WOW', which is not here. That version with the chior was fabulous, and I would have rather seen it here than something like 'Finer Feelings'. Too many of the songs were slowed down, wouldn't it be possible to have 'Better the Devil You Know' still a stomper with whirling strings and passionate delivery?<br /><br />So as a dire fan, THANK YOU, Kylie for this. This unique recollection of your career is exciting and gives us a lot to chew on. Yet I find myself wanting something new as I go through this set. This will tide me over until next year's promised new album.<br /><br />I will say one more thing, I hope that the adult contemporary and classical stations in the US pick up on this collection. Ms. Kylie has done this unplugged/orchestral collection better than most.
0618918248|3.0|I guess I found the philosophy not so logical and just did not like the the way it did not explain what the alternative would be...
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|The film is a boring repetition of a standard theme.  No originality, no sophistication, poor attempts humor, and few redeeming qualities.  Don't waste your time.  This is way more Disney than Pixar.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|The quality of writing, acting, design and direction continues. We loved how this series delved more deeply into individual characters' stories, whilst still progressing the main story line and historical context.  Can't wait for season 6!
B007HU7NBK|2.0|I'd mentioned in my review about Duff McKagan's auto-biography, It's So Easy, that there are some bios and auto-bios that make me like the subject more and some that have made me like the subject less than when I'd started reading. Before I tell you which slot JT's auto-bio falls under, lemme explain a few things...<br /><br />Duran Duran was my favorite band throughout most of my teen years. I'm talking pictures all over my walls, in my school books, official fan club membership, collecting their records and videos, etc. I'd even began playing the bass because of John. He and Nick were my fave members...at least until Nick got married, then John held the title all by his lonesome. Later on, in my early 20s, my fanaticism with JT as well as the band as a whole had tapered off, but I still liked their music. The Astronaut album put them right back at the top of my list. The reuniting of the fab five...priceless! So, let's fast forward to my finding out about JT's auto-bio. My first thought was, \\"if there's a book signing, I'M GOING!\\" He came to NY and I met my bass god, got my autograph n' all that good stuff. Couldn't wait to start reading the book!<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />I felt like I was reading Cliff's Notes. Topics were mentioned with little or no detail provided. I'd also come away from this book feeling as though he'd taken the band's success for granted. To achieve the level of success that Duran had achieved in the 80s is extremely rare for any performer(s) and a hell of a blessing! Maybe it came too quickly for him *shrug* I'd read Andy's (Taylor) book a few months prior to John's, I couldn't help but compare the two books. Andy's won (and he'd always been my least fave member, but personality's everything and Andy has it in spades!! I love that kid now, lol!) Anywho, as I was reading In The Pleasure Groove, I felt my admiration for John diminish. A lot. At one point...okay, a couple of points, I just wanted to ditch the book and just move on to something else, but I decided to finish it since I'd purchased it 2ce (once for the Kindle version (convenience), and the hardcopy for the autograph). Maybe my expectations were too high. All that glitters... :-/<br /><br />I still love his bass playing though! That'll never fade.<br /><br />On the bright side, there are a crap load of great photos. It's also wonderful that he's no longer partaking in illegal substances. I wish him the best.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I so enjoyed listening to this CD - which I have done more than once already, although it is early in the holiday season still.  The rendition of &#34;Baby It's Cold Outside&#34; with Natalie Cole is especially enjoyable - in fact the best I've ever heard.
B008KE3960|5.0|This is an excellent game, really enjoy destroying tanks!!! No problems at all with it so it's worth the download!
B004J64QSI|5.0|We rented this concert from Netflix, watched it, and ordered it from Amazon the next day.  No criticisms.  It was totally satisfying to us.  We have a media room with excellent acoustics and surround speakers, so we got the full benefit of Blu-ray.  Fabulous.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Super fun to play and easy enough to understand for my 8 year old. I also enjoy playing it myself
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I didn't care for this game. Hate to say it, but I couldn't figure it out. I got rid of it and won't be getting it again. Glad I got the free version.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|makes you want to get up and dance, was an affordable purchase and recommend to anyone who loved the movie
B000069KE0|5.0|Music is a personal choice.  I love this album because Ballet For a Girl in Buchannon is so well done.  I don't have any Chicago albums made after Terry Kath died, and I have no interest in them.  Terry sounds great on this one.
1469984202|5.0|If you like science fiction, you'll like Wool.  If you don't like science fiction, you'll still probably like Wool.<br /><br />If you live in a post-apocalyptic bunker society, though, then this might hit a little too close to home.
B000069KGM|5.0|Music is a personal choice.  I like this album because it has less Peter Cetera on lead vocals then some albums.  Peter is great, just not my thing.  When you think Chicago, if 1980's ballads are all that come to mind, give this album a try.  I don't have any of their albums made after Terry Kath died, and I have no interest in them.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|For some reason apps are no longer downloading onto my first edition Kindle Fire.  I'm just glad I did not try to purchase the one that cost money.
0805091742|3.0|This product arrived very quickly.  Although I ordered this item, I ordered for one of my doctors here at work.  He seem quite pleased to get it.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Excellent, but you need to read all three of the books in the trilogy to appreciate the whole story. Loved it.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|My daughter, wife, and I loved this movie in the theater and enjoyed it again through Amazon.  It is a new take on Christmas and what matters most: everyone is important, and sometimes it turns out that the one you least expect is most important of all.  Great addition to the Christmas play list!
0547569653|5.0|I loved this book! I felt like Scott really bared his soul, and that means a lot to<br />a myself as a reader. As a one year vegan and new runner his story is very<br />inspirational...we really can do anything we want bad enough. I related to his<br />story in many ways, but I am the one with possible M.S....and bipolar 2 disorder...<br />both illnesses hitting at once in 2011. I've changed everything in my life and<br />now am not the same person. I run 5-10 miles at a time now and purchased this<br />book to help w/ motivation for my first half marathon coming up soon. I was very<br />surprised to read about his family especially his mom's battle with M.S.<br />Made me want to fight for my health all the more. Thank you Scott, I hope to<br />meet you someday!
B00881PPTO|5.0|This is an exceptional app, it is now easy for me find a flight plan, it even has conversions, it finds hotels it as well haven't messed with that part yet, if it finds rental cars too, then hot diggity damn, I think me and my wife are taking a trip sooner then we thought
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. A complete waste of time and money. So corny, hokey and stupid.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I received damaged pressings.  The LPs have numerous scratches and abrasions rendering sides and tracks virtually unlistenable.  Too bad the pressing plant didn't heed the suggestion \\"handle with care\\" mentioned in the accompanying book.  Also, most are warped.  This is quite a bit to pay for \\"used\\" records.****************************************<br />UPDATE: Amazon kindly replaced the first set. The second set has similar problems: Pressings damaged with scratches and abrasions. Also, they're warped, off-center, and under-filled. Using the best LP from the set, I performed a direct A/B comparison to the same album from the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs boxed set (1980s). I used identical ReVox tables w/Studer Linatrack arms, both equipped with Shure V15-V and new JICO SAS stylii. The difference is dramatic. The MFSL sound is clean, with clarity in the mids, sweetness in the highs. The new Capitol pressings sound mushy and indistinct in the mids, the highs are harsh. We won't know what the 2009 digital remasters sound like on vinyl until EMI makes quality pressings available.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I have many Collectors Editions in my DVD collections and this is the most beautiful of them all. very sturdy crystal plastic case that will last forever. Also there is the most BEAUTIFUL set of 5x7 Collectors set. of picture postcards of the stars of this beautiful film that are suitable for framing. Words cannot express how beautiful this set is..i will order. more from this seller as great gifts. And the movie itself is wonderful. All around, one of my best Amazon purchases. Highly reccommended!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  Cant wait for the next one to come out!  A must read!!!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|It was fun until it stopped working. Every time I tried to play it just exited back to the kindle home screen! THIS IS RETARDED!
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I anticipated a slightly more &#34;tell all&#34; version when I bought this. There was enough detail to give you an idea of her younger years, but the years has a young 20 something woman were far more explicit and it was largely more the internal struggle she had, having accepting that this would be her life. I couldn't book the book down, ultimately it is a story that, thankfully, few of us can relate to. Worth a read if you can stomach the story line.
6305428042|5.0|Halloween is the time for this. If it turns out to not be Halloween then maybe just wait for that to come around.
B000SEI230|4.0|A beautiful story that was very well represented by the cinematic version. Quick, easy read that I thoroughly enjoyed, with a positive message.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I would bet money that this movie is too good. It probably will make some people upset because of this.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I'm going to let this review act as my review for all four seasons as a whole.<br />Breaking Bad is the unique story of Walter White, and underachieving high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and resolves to start cooking meth amphetamine for easy fast money in his remaining years to live. This show is dark, hilarious, powerful, fascinating, and one of a kind, all throughout its first four seasons, latching a relentless grip onto your attention and never letting you go. It's difficult to get a taste of this show and not become a hardcore junkie, always wanting more.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Flashback to the 80's.  Didn't realize that it was a musical but it was okay.  Tom Cruise can do anything!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|its fun but needs some tweeking. also you shold make a minecraft one if ya don't now what minecraft is than google it.I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS but with star wars its WAY BETTER.<br />I hope you take my advice. Also make the minecraft angry birds free plz.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Read this on a cruise with a 2nd City Comedy Troupe on board.  Laughed out load the whole time. I think I annoyed the people traveling with me since I couldn't stop quoting the book the whole time.
B009KKLQVS|1.0|I just received this and just now saw that only 21 songs are included.  As others have noted they did up to 50 songs a night during this tour.  I thought I was ordering a full show.  Not even half the show is included.  What a disgrace!  I hope Brian or Michael are reading this.  Did you guys green light this ripoff?  Shame!
B004GYY714|5.0|one of the most entertaining app.....listen to best music of the world.....must have app...works well on low internet speeds too without bufering...<br /><br />team it up with shazam or other song recognition app to boost your music experience and enjoy favourite songs with lyrics...
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I just bought this game and it wont even open. whenever I try to play it the game loads to about 98% it just shuts off. please fix this.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This soundtrack could make watching paint dry turn into an epic adventure you tell your grandchildren about. Watching one of their concerts live must make everyone feel like running straight up a mountain while fist-fighting a pride of hungry lions.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This is at Disney's highest standard. Very entertaining for my grandchildren who are 11, 9, and 4 (and me). We have all watched it four times since receiving it a couple of weeks ago. It's always like a special occasion. Beautiful color and magic effects as well as a warm story.
0805086846|5.0|I chose this book because I like to read about history. This is not the history you learned in school. This is the native american view of the way it was. This is not the movie version of the American west. If you want a different version of what happened this is a great place to start.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I love The Walking Dead!! They can get my money anytime if they keep making shows like this. Who knew that it would be this tasteful, scary and fun. Makes me wonder how I would survive if that happened
1401201911|3.0|Millar begins with a superb premise, and while the story drags a bit in the middle, the climax of Lex Luthor matching wits against the Superman is well worth the read. Unfortunately the story doesn't have a denouement so much as a nosedive into an unnecessary \\"La jetée\\"-style ending that drove me up a wall.<br /><br />Also, it strikes me as odd that Superman doesn't take Truth, Justice, and the American Way to a ridiculous extreme, yet somehow being raised in the Soviet Union he becomes a dictator. However, I can see the point given the \\"scariness\\" of Russia in the minds of American audiences, and it doesn't hurt the story.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|is a greatest game for all ages.!!. my friends an me pass hours of fun is and they loved this game at the first time they played it
B000Z8KAUM|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing. On a grander scale this movie holds a different note than the previous two but definitely on the same scale with Eleven and better than Twelve. The crime is so sophisticated and complex I gotta give it to 'em :)
1452110581|5.0|Had to smile as i read this book. Made me think of &#34;Blue&#34;,Rupert, Daisy ...all gone for years,but all the great memories resurfaced. A great stocking stuffer  for cat lovers or anyone with a sense of humor!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|You can download the video file or as an mp3 file..fast! I've downloaded several files. Does not hang up or crash.Best app eva!
B000000OMP|5.0|Whitesnake is known for their sexy, seductive lyrics and good band performances, and this cd delivers all that and more...
B007N8RULO|5.0|Sometimes games are not the version you were looking for -- this one was perfect.  I was so glad i took the time to look for the version I was accustomed to.
0547569653|5.0|I know Scott as a friend. Not super close, but we've cooked meals together. We've run together. We've drank a beer or two and talked about life. He's a great guy. Really.<br />Then I read his book and now I really know Scott. It is strange, it isn't everyday you have the opportunity to know this much about a friend. Eat and Run dives into the deepest (and sometimes darkest) parts of Scott's life and gives you access to what makes normal but highly motivated guy tick. It's pretty cool.<br /><br />I learned about how Scott uses his body as a laboratory to learn about diet. I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but after reading this I have changed the way I approach food and the way I think about the calories I give myself.<br />I'm not an ultrarunner. I like to run, but nothing like distances that Scott does. What I did learn is that the joy I get from a run where I lose myself is the same as the joy Scott gets 90 miles into a run. He just gets it 100 times more intense but the idea is the same. It is fun to learn about psyche of someone who has trained himself to suffer so much and get a kick out of it.<br /><br />Read this book. It will make you psyched. It will make you understand about people different than you. And it will make you appreciate what a really truly nice guy Scott is. I now do.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is a great movie Charlize Theron plays the evil queen ravenna Chris Hemsworth plays the huntsman and Kristen Stewart plays snow white. This a really great movie to watch it has great effects
0525953728|5.0|I will not debate morals or giving away secret info<br />Seems as though you can buy all the stuff he used (except for a secret Blackhawk chopper) online<br />Nice to hear about people working well together and being commitetd
B0041KVW2K|5.0|this is a AWESOME COLLECTION....  MUSIC SOUNDS INCREDIBLE!!<br /><br />I COULDNT BE MORE HAPPY WITH THIS SET.THE MUSIC,THE PAKAGING, THE AWESOME BOOK IS OUTSTANDING!!.... ALL YOU NEGATIVE RATERS<br /><br />NEED TO BUY A NEW TURNTABLE OR HAVE YOUR EARS CHECKED!!!  BETTER YET STICK TO MP3'S<br /><br />LEAVE THE VINYL FOR US WHO LOVE IT!
1400069289|5.0|We do many things based on habit: brush our teeth, eat certain cereals, follow certain routines. Some habits are good. Some we may want to change. The latter are what this book is about. Author Charles Duhigg breaks a habit into three parts: cue, response and reward. In order to change a habit, we must intervene at one or more of these points. But there's more to it than that. To change, you must believe it's possible.<br /><br />Duhigg includes fascinating stories of corporations and how small changes in habits led to huge success stories. These keystone habits, as he calls them, help companies develop cultures in which employees support one another, which is extremely beneficial to all.<br /><br />One chapter explains how stores can develop advertising campaigns that will appeal to you based on your past purchasing habits. There's also a chapter asking whether we are responsible for problems and even crimes triggered by habits, such as a man who murdered his wife during his habit of sleepwalking.<br /><br />The appendix titled \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas\\" will help you move down the road to evaluating and possibly improving personal and/or occupational habits. More than 50 pages of end notes and a detailed index complete the book. This book is a fun read and just may offer a few keys to the success of our self-improvement projects.<br /><br />Reviewed by Shirley Brosius, author of Sisterhood of Faith and co-author of Turning Guilt Trips into Joy Rides.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I’m a major Grisham fan…. I’ve read most of his works. He has not lost his touch! The Racketeer tells an amazing story. It’s full of twists and turns. Another great work from a brilliant legal mind!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I wasn't much of a fan of the song, \\"Home\\", although it has become the ubiquitous theme song for so many things but the rest of the album appealed to me more.  Give Phillip Phillips a chance.
B007SGM084|5.0|I would most definitely purchase future writings by this author. I could not put these books down. Looking forward to a fourth book E L James is willing. 5 stars all the way!
B0012YYZYK|5.0|If you were aroun in the 1970s 1980s, you had midnite movies, and colleges and this was playing everywhere.<br /><br />The only problem was the film was too short. The blu-ray brings the footage shot but we never saw.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer will Blow You Away. I had no idea the original footage was this good. I saw this in HD on TV and my jaw was on ground, the actual DVD without cable compression, is even better.<br /><br />Essential for the Zep fan.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Not so much.  I was intrigued by the cover, the notion of using the photos as a story, but it does not hang together well.  At first, the mystery of the grandfather and the strange people in town is compelling, but once the secret is out, the novel becomes a bit tedious and predictable.  I would not recommend this one.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I really liked the premise but found the plot setup the same as the otehrs, reluctant superheroes drawn back together. Its been done so many times. Great graphics, great picture, but I found it a repeat of many others. Your mileage may vary.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|After reading the book, you still know very little about the Maze and the purpose of the Maze.  In spite of that, the action is intense and the series is a hit with my students.  It's a good one to recommend to boys.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I found this book disappointing.  It started well and quickly became bogged down in a boring and predictable plot.  Up until the last page I was anticipating a quick turn in the plot and nothing really happened.  The main character developed during the book; however, the other characters seemed shallow and were only in the plot to enhance the story telling.  I rate this an easy book to help you fall asleep and you will not be sorry when it ends.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I found the people interesting in this book, unlike the ones in Distant Hours.  The parallel plots were laid out in an interesting way.  I liked the realities of the war and the difficulties of being disappointed in those you love.  Although it's set in modern times, it retains some of the gothic feel that Morton does well.  I hope Morton returns to her more gothic self soon.  She writes well, even if you don't like the story or some of her characters.  (And we aren't really supposed to like all characters, are we?)
B00881PPTO|5.0|Its just like the free kayak but without the ads. I have no problem with there being no other differences since i hate ads and usually always buy the ad free version anyway. Shouldnt rate fhe app lower just because you dont want to pay to remove ads, some people want that option.
1596680180|2.0|Its ok, well organized, good pictures but in my opinion &#34;they all look alike&#34;!  I was hoping for something more.  Not a lot of variety for me personally.  I've found &#34;cooler&#34; info on youtube.
1451627297|4.0|This is a fantastic book for many reasons. A fictionalized account of time travel, what would happen if you tried to change history, and *spoiler!* why you couldn't or SHOULDN'T.<br />It's quite compelling at the start, when the time portal is discovered, the fun of living in a time before you were born, etc.<br />Unfortunately, this becomes sidetracked by a love story that, while integral to the plot, really goes on for too long.<br />The last 100 pages are a doozy. I was almost breathless, waiting to find out whether our hero can stop the assasination or not.<br />If you can get through the first 700 pages, you'll like this book. A lot.<br />Having said that, this novel reminds me somewhat of It. A fantastic premise, but immensely padded and long. At least this book has a satisfying ending. In the case of It, King creates this world that draws you in for 1000 pages, and you expect a big payoff, but seemingly King didn't know how to give the reader a truly worthwhile ending.<br />Worthwhile. Get it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really fell in love with the series. Could not wait for the next book to start it. Devoured all three books in about a two week time frame! however, it still left me wanting more but I did like the ending. Just now watched the movie for the first time and was so glad I read the books first. Really filled in the information. Wish the other parts, 2 and 3 were already out for the movies. Could not lay the book down. Amazing story and such vivid detail . Could actually see it in my &#34;minds eye&#34;.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Anything by Barbra is well worth purchasing! I love it that she went back and found music that shouldn't have been left out in the first place.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|The sound is crisp and it can easily be heard that Botnick did a lot of work on these recordings.
B005CZQ9I0|5.0|Anything by Barbra is well worth purchasing! And Alan and Marilyn write the most beautiful music and lyrics in the world.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Has all the elements of a great book!! Love, action, drama etc! The end was a little tough to read about war and more war, but it is necessary. I learned so much about history too.
B0043UB0EI|4.0|Lots of sex violence and a twists in the plot. At first it looks like just a bunch of T&A but it get better and better story wise.
0307946711|3.0|I love the unique narrative, a peek into two peoples' lives on the same day every year. The relationship is not always definable, comfortable or desired, but something keeps them together.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The laser weapon and the light saber are great. I would recommend this to anyone that has played angry birds before. even if they were not big fans in the past they will be after using the force.
0375842209|5.0|This book is best described as hauntingly beautiful. The voice of this is powerful and unique. It is the story of war, courage and the power of words to change peoples’ lives/perceptions. Two things make this book standout: death is the narrator and the primary characters are Germans hiding Jews in the middle World War II. I cannot say enough glowing words about this book.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I couldn't download this movie after several attempts. I reset my Kindle and it didn't help. I'm not sure what the problem was. I have comtacted customer support.
B008476HBM|4.0|I have not read a lot of this book yet.  It is very interesting.  It is set in older times when horses and buggies were used.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I loved angry birds so I knew I would like this one. It is a lot of fun figuring out how to build the crazy contraptions so they will work.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Haven't played for long yet but loving every minute so far! A lot like farmville or cityville but with the great charm of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|this game makes me throw my kindle fire on the floor and stomp on it.it makes me so frustrated I don't recommend this app at all.
0345803493|5.0|KEPT ME INTERESTED TO THE END. I HAVE PASSED THIS BOOK ALONG TO CO-WORKERS.  GOOD CASE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I am a die hard Rihanna fan who isn't afraid to say if I'm not feeling one of Rihanna's tracks of CD's but THIS IS THE ALBUM! I think this will be her number 1! She is so versatile in this album, and it's not what I expected at all and I loved how she shocked many of her fans with new dubstep and urban sounds! And the ballads were beautiful on this album! Good Girl Gone Bad is my number one favorite album by Rihanna, but this album has pushed Good Girl Gone Bad to the side! And Talk That Talk who? If you aren't ready for something new and different, don't buy this album, if you are, BUY IT!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a book that I will want to retread from time to time to help me gain perspective. I felt good reading it because of the way she invites us to live.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|These movies are never very realistic but always entertaining. I am looking forward to the next edition of Mission Impossible.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A bit slow at first, but all in all a charming movie about relationships, adjusting to another culture. and continuing to learn about yourself and your strengths well into old age.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just loved all the surprices. Gillian Flynn is a master of describing malfunctioning individuals from their own points of view.
B008F5QQI2|4.0|A 4-star effort indeed.  I really like George's music, but the only reason why i cannot give it a full 5 stars is there is just someting about the song that makes me feel like he either didnt put his best into it or something just wasnt quite right.  Make no mistake about it, i am not expecting another FAITH album, but i really would like to see George comeback strong and leave the doubters in the dust.
0861714911|5.0|I purchased this book about a year ago and it has been extremely beneficial. As a fledgling Theravadan, the earliest Pali suttas are important to me. As Bhante Punna (Pittsburgh Buddhist Center) and I discussed yesterday, this anthology of the Buddha's seminal teachings is the foundation on which all of Buddhism was built.<br /><br />If you are wondering what all the hype is about regarding Buddha, it's in this book. Everything from an objective account of his birth, to his incredible life as a world redeemer, to his teachings regarding meditation, to what people were discussing about him in the years after his death. You can read this book and hang in any conversation about Buddhism. If you are already a practitioner, this is your foundation right here, whether you practice Mahayana or Theravada.<br /><br />Enjoy this book. If you have any questions about further readings feel free to email me. I wish you happiness and well-being.
B00A135YUW|5.0|I love her style of music. It's has a classic American feel to it like Born to Die did. I think she will eventually have tremendous success at some point soon.
B00122FTQA|5.0|I like the title cut, Amarantine, especially. What else can I say to meet the required number of words? Enya is great!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The author states he wanted to write a book that did not require a lot of research. You can tell he has put much more into his other works than The Racketeer. I miss the richness of the legal process.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Lets just say we had a lot of amazing sex after we both read this book.  I still haven't tied her up yet, but the sex is still great!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is great to hear a first hand account of what really happened. I was happy to see they still have the M-79 grenade launcher, though modified, since it was my favorite weapon also. We owe a great amount of gratitude to someone who can provide us with such detail of how such an historic mission actually occurred.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved the show, love the books just as much!  Read these so you can finally understand why Cersei is such a ****!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is one of those gems you stumble upon that is so well thought out, so superbly cast, so fun to watch and a delight to the movie watching experience that you wish it would never end.  This is how movies should be made.  Charming and a must see for real movie enthusiasts.

B0073COMKW|4.0|I got these to replace a set of five 75W incandescent bulbs in my dining room fixture. I put them all in, turned on the fixture, and one of the five did not work. Given the price, I can't say that I was completely shocked. However, with Amazon's return policy and the fact that I have Prime, I simply just ordered another one and returned this one (shipping paid by Amazon) for a refund.<br /><br />Now as for the operational lights...they work good. They don't appear more than marginally dimmer than the 75W bulbs that they replaced. This is great since they are technically a 60W replacement bulb. The operation is silent, and the light hue is pretty pleasing to the eye and not far off from the incandescent bulbs (I got the warm white).  Bottom line...I'd buy more for some of the &#34;non-dimmer&#34; applications in my house.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family and I love this film. The minions and girls are lovable from the start and the &#34;hero&#34; grows on you very quickly. I highly recommend it for any family.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is so cool I did  not  expect so much fun so if you want to get the app get it. you will like the app if you like arcade games.
B0053O89IS|5.0|My sister and her family got me hooked on this show. My husband also loves it. It is funny and quick witted. I don't know biology so I don't know for sure if all the scientific statements are true, and it is definitely science fiction where the technology/policing is concerned, but dang if it doesn't make up for it in dialogue and story line.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is the best book I have read this year! And I read a ton of books! Would totally recommend it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book touched so many nerves in my being.  I cried through much of it.  The sadness and pain endured by orphaned and adopted children cannot be forgotten in a lifetime.<br />Eleanor M
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Wonderful and scary.  Different from last season, but just as good.<br />If you like suspense, you will love this show.  Just when you think you have figured it out  BAM!! things are never what they seem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love reading about Jesus and the stories regarding Him and those who have also been blessed with faith in times of adversity.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|Not my favorite version...It's ok and that's about it. I'm spoiled by the original versions and this one just doesn't cut it for me personally.  Still, I risked purchasing it just to see it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game so far. I wish it was on facebook to play to so my friends could enjoy it with me. this is the kind of game I have been waiting for.
1574216988|4.0|I chose this rating because the book is illustraited in easy to follow instructions.<br /> I have been doing  design doodling for some time and when I discovered  these Zentangle books  it has increased  my interest to take it further.<br /> There is nothing to dislike here.<br /> I would recommend  this book to ALL ages.........doodling lowers the blood pressure !
B00297FEUS|5.0|The Stay Hungry album speaks for itself... Not only a hit machine but also a great and heavy hard rock/heavy metal record by the goods Twisted Sister. The bonus material makes it even better... Those diehard fans (like me) won't complain about it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was tremendous!  My only wish was that it picked up a little earlier on.  The last 300 pages was a rollercoaster and I didn't want to put it down!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Iap not a big deal, don't do it if you don't like it, the game is cool. Seems stable on my galaxy SII. Thanks Amazon faotd.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|A very different sound (overtones of Deftones) and a kick a$$ attitude makes this CD so cool!! Brinks vocals are haunting and Chris and the &#34;new guys&#34; are certainly in top form!!!
B00881PPTO|5.0|I traveled a lot but never used Kayak yet. With the diverse reviews, I wanted to see for myself. Downloaded Google's free one first with no option from them to buy out of ads. Looked up hotels from a destination I stayed at a lot and the price was the same.. Kayak compares many sources and lets you choose who to buy from - no login needed by Kayak, but the free one did have an (1) ad. Uninstall Google's.<br />  Installed Amazons,  ran the same search with the same results... and no ads. For a veteran traveler, this is a great tool, all options in front of you by category. Kayak even built in maps and their own custom photos (not just copy/paste off vendor websites). This is a great faotd, I am having to say thanks Amazon again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an awesome show full of suspense. Every episode ending keeps me wanting for more. Its not just a mindless zombie killing series the storyline is good and the characters are well thought out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|People say this series is 'just like 50 shades'. It has some similarities in the character's backgrounds and is erotica, yes, but this story line couldn't be more different. I loved it and can't wait for book 3!

B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book in a day! I couldn't put it down. It was one of my favorites. It's a lot like 50 shades of Grey. The story line keeps you going! I couldn't wait to read the second one.

0547884591|5.0|I will say the key to Ferriss is he takes things that could be really boring books and makes you want to sit down and read them. I learned a ton in the four hour work and already knew much of what was in the four hour body but still was very entertained. The four hour chef entertains and teaches. The fact that he calls you out to a challenge and makes you keep score to do the cooking lessons is really smart...I admit it. I made recipe one Osso buco night two...a book made me do that....a book. Very cool.
0345803485|5.0|I bought it to give as a gift, and the person that received it was surprised and very pleased to get it,  it's not something I would want to read,,,,,it's just not my taste.
0547884591|5.0|Learn how to memorize a deck of cards in under a minute? Say What?!? Tim Ferris has managed to create a 600 page book that entertains, inspires, and yes, teaches you how catch pigeons from your local park and then eat them. Full of illustrations, there is probably something in this book for everybody, and I highly recommend it. My wife has not read this yet, but thanks to my new found culinary skills, I think my wife would recommend this book as well.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a great love story if you can get over the gay part. the love and friendship is heart breaking. great movie

B000W91RUG|5.0|Love this show and bought it for a friend for his birthday and he thinks it's great. can't wait to get the others.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I rated this okay because it is a standard game.  I have not found any way to get the screen to look like the one that is with this review.
B001RPIYV4|1.0|I heard it was a great movie from a friend so i bought it. didn't like the way they spoke in the movie old english
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|There are no instructions that I could find, no details of the object of the game.  I guess for a real gamer it would be ok.  However, for me it is useless.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|for me<br />another pretty cheesy action flick..<br />required almost nothing of the actors..<br />I'd like to see film students, pref. freshmen, mock it.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|A must-read classic with no edits.  I found that reading it in my middle age, I relate more with the adults. That was a surprise.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great show, really intense , hope they continue to put more weekly shows like this one... would highly recommend to everyone
B00992CF6W|1.0|ok I love this app. but now its just a piece of crap!! I tried opening it and turning off my kindle and it still refuses to work!!

B0040ZA2D6|5.0|My daughter was so excited to get this CD.  If there is a BTR fan in the house, this CD is excellent.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris is a unique guy that brings a fresh approach to all his books. In his the 4 hour Chef he shows us how to learn anything in as short a time as possible by applying some proven techniques. He then goes on to show us an example, cooking. I will apply his learning techniques to learning another language and the piano. In the meantime I'm learning how to cook for real, something I never thought I would be able to do!<br /><br />Thank you sir for enriching our lives!
0553288105|4.0|Well the whole book was really good and i enjoy it, while sometimes it gets you bored.<br />What is it that makes it a mastepiece? Well it is written in 3 parts-sections and SECTION 2<br />IS WHAT WE CALL A GENIUS WRITING! IT WAS PHENOMENAL! HOW ASIMOV COULD EVEN<br />THINK ABOUT SUCH STUFF AND THEN PUT THEM ON PAPER?That section deserves top 10 ever<br />in SF.Period.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Compelling and intriguing.  A new twist on Sherlock Holmes and Watson, but substantive and beguiling.  Of course, love Bill Heck as Watson (Lucy Liu's) ex-boyfriend.
0547884591|5.0|I see a lot of complaints that this book is unfocused and disorganized. These people clearly glazed over the part before meta learning where Tim tells you to skip it if you want to go straight to cooking. From there, you have the freedom to skip over anything not pertaining to cooking. Like the 4 hour body, it's about choosing what is relevant to you.<br /><br />On a similar note, all the reviews telling you with certainty that you won't learn to cook from this book can't possibly know this from the first week. Come back in a month.
0547884591|5.0|Got my copy of The 4-Hour Chef last week, and I was not disappointed. The first thing you notice is how beautiful the book itself is, a lot of pictures, and fun layouts. The first section, on Meta-learning, is invaluable, whether you want to learn to cook or to sword fight. The recipes go from easy to hard, slowly guiding you along the finer points. I can't stress enough how simple he makes it for you to be able to start cooking great food. It's a really fun book that you won't want to put down.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Only tried it a couple times - didn't like that I had to pay for it after buying an expensive Kindle.  It isn't as easy to take pictures with as I thought it would be.

0062127241|3.0|The whole is often greater than the sum of it's parts. This is particularly true in rock music where the music of a band may have been initially conceived by one person; but the final work is the sum of the whole band. Pete Townsend's best work with The Who should concern us and entertain us more than our idle curiosity into Mr. Townsend's personal life. Unfortunately we would like our musical heroes to also be like a good friend; witty,kind,  and understandable. And we would like the autobiographies of our heroes to have some of those same qualities as well. Pete Townsend's \\"Who I Am\\" is best when it illuminate his early life and early musical adventures including the rise of The Who. This is the strongest part of the book. Unfortunately the book becomes a long enumeration of drug and personal problems intertwined with far too many ideas for 'works in progress' that never come to fruition. We are left with a picture of a person who has abstract and grandiose themes bubbling up inside but without having the requisite finesse to articulate these ideas in an engaging, coherent or entertaining fashion. We do not have to like a musician as a person in order to enjoy the music that he once created as part of a band. But we do have to enjoy a person's prose style in order to wade through many chapters of manic deeds and personal weakness. At a certain point in \\"Who I Am\\" I came to lose interest. It was as if Mr. Townsend's telling of his incoherent life became too much like an early Who song, \\"I Can't Explain\\". Manic self-obsession may never be easy to explain; but this book will show you why it eventually makes for tedious reading.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Keeps you on your seat with the fast pace story, beautiful scenery. Follows the book closely.Can't wait to see season 2.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I had a great time playing this and couldn't put it down till it was done (many hours). I had to use the &quot;hint&quot; more than on Snark but I liked it just as much as it is a different type of game. I hope Alawar keeps these kinds of games coming as it is well worth the money. I get way more enjoyment out of these games on my off time than paying to see a movie. I get to use my brain and I don't get gouged for refreshments.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is a Xmas present for my son. he is 9 and hasn't seen the first generation of Batman movies. All the villians he likes are in this set.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and good variations.  First game I've tried on my new kindle and love it.  Recommend for any beginner.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Great transfer to blue ray, Great sound, opening scene worth the purchase price.  Peter O'Toole played the part of T. E. Lawrence perfectly. My Great Uncle Frank knew T. E. Lawrence and said when he visited us from England in the early 60's that he was even more of an &#34;odd bird&#34; in real life than O'Tool portrayed him.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game deserves no less than a 5-star review. Every single aspect of it was perfect 4 years ago, and now, WOW, there are no words.  You HAVE to play this game with your headphones on, so that you can truly appreciate the music, the audio, and the voice acting, which are all TOP-notch. It's a game that you want to pace yourself while playing too, so that you can get the most enjoyment out of it. There is so much to do, after all, so playing for just an hour or two every day after school or after work can be very satisfying. The story is rich and engrossing, and you'll probably find yourself thinking about it even while you're not playing. And the gameplay is fantastic as well, of course, but can be quite challenging. I recommend you select Normal difficulty if you're a newcomer, and that you grind a lot, buy a lot of useful items to increase your HP and SP at any time, and keep your equipment up to date too. Oh, and SAVE. Keep multiple save-files because there are other ways that you can get a Game Over in this game besides being defeated in battle.<br /><br />Overall, this a MUST-OWN for any self-respecting Vita owner. It's almost worth getting a Vita over, even if it's been out on the PS2 since forever. Don't hesitate and buy yourself a copy of this game ASAP, either physically or through the PS Store for the same price but at an added toll of 3.5 GB or so to your memory. Either way it's totally worth it. So BUY, BUY, BUY!!!<br /><br />And encourage others to do the same of course! This game is life-changing stuff folks!!! LIFE-CHANGING!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.: I almost forgot! Bring your philosophizing cap you guys! This game has a serious ability to make you think, consider, and look at things from a totally different perspective than what you might be used to. If you pay attention, you will certainly be rewarded with a fresh and new outlook on life... Don't believe me? Play it then, and see for yourself! :)
0547884591|5.0|I'm a fan of FHWW and FHB, but when I first heard of 4HC I thought that was stretching it too far. After only a couple of chapters, though, I'm already totally intrigued.<br /><br />It turns out a cooking book makes total sense - and is actually a great service to the world.<br /><br />Tim's approach to learning - and life - is truly unique. Applying it to food - and learning itself - can add a richness to millions of people's lives that they would likely never have found on their own. What a great thing!<br /><br />I am genuinely excited about this book. Kudos to him - and Amazon Publishing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Note: I will update this when I get the actual Blu-ray.<br /><br />Before I get to this most recent rendition of Ian Fleming's renowned franchise, let me start by talking about its influence. It's been 50 years since the character has been around in movie form with a total of 9 actor portrayals. Sean Connery WAS my favorite, with Pierce Brosnan at 2nd, and I guess Roger Moore at 3rd. Historically-speaking, I grew up watching a lot of the films on TV during TBS's Bond marathons. I loved the escapist reality, the sort of spy-fantasy nature, and the coolness of all the sleuthing, gadgetry, exoticism, and grandeur that became a staple of Bond since the '60s. But like all things, there comes a time when adaptation becomes necessary for survival. In relation to Bond, I was kinda' getting tired of the flashiness, that at some point in Brosnan's later run, started to become a bit stagnant. Then along came the Bourne movies, which for all intents and purposes re-defined the spy-thriller genre with a fresher, grittier depiction that relied less on flash (at least from the perspective of gadgetry) and more on actual character development.<br /><br />When Daniel Craig was cast as the newest 007 the influence of Bourne was very apparent in 2006's Casino Royale. It embodied everything Bond fans have come to love: the exotic locales, the stylish wardrobe, the beautiful girl (Eva Green was quite stunning), and of course, great action. But what's this? Not only was it everything we've come to expect out of Bond, but it even tried building his character. Long story short: Casino Royale is the beginnings of Bond. It portrays him as brash, wild, hard-headed, yet mentally tough. After falling in love with Vesper Lynd, his \\"armor\\" is broken and we see that he does, indeed, have a softer side and that he's still a salvageable human being. When he loses her, he goes on an angry revenge streak in Quantum of Solace, only to realize the emptiness that vengeance would bring him as well as allthe collateral pain and destruction he caused in its wake. Instead, he comes to peace by forgiving himself and those involved making for what was, in my opinion, a masterful story arc that definitely re-vitalized my interest in the franchise.<br /><br />And then came a Bond hiatus thanks to MGM being stuck on the verge of bankruptcy. It took 3 years, but the new one is finally here; Skyfall. I've heard a few people complain about the first 2 Craig movies saying they were too much of a \\"Bourne ripoff.\\" I disagree with that notion because Bourne is awesome, so combining cool with awesome was okay for me, and I think the majority agrees. That being said, here's take three for Craig, this time under the helm of Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. Now I've yet to see his claim to glory in American Beauty, but I have seen Road to Perdition, which I highly regard as a masterpiece in its own right for its dark, gritty, and bittersweet story of violence, redemption, and the touching bonds across multiple generations of fathers and sons. Craig worked with Mendes in Road to Perdition, and although Craig's role in the film was relatively low-key, I have to say I was really excited at the prospect when the news of his hiring was announced, as if the first 2 Craig movies weren't enough of a character study already.<br /><br />So how did the pairing work? (*clears throat*) Ahem.. brilliantly! There are so many things that work for this film from the plot, directing, overall presentation, and certainly, the very character-building elements that made the first two movies so engrossing. To me, Skyfall first and foremost comes off as a point of transition in Craig's career as 007. In fact, I'd even say it's a kind of \\"midlife crisis\\" for the character of Bond. Sounds weird, right? But hear me out. In the first, I dunno, 20 minutes of the movie we see Bond on mission in Istanbul, Turkey. He gets wounded and fakes his death for a little bit to get away from MI6 and the stress and pressure of being a double O agent. But when MI6 is exposed to, basically, the entire world, Bond comes out of \\"temporary retirement\\" to do what he does best: find the bad guys and kill 'em. However, he comes back in not-so-great condition. He's out of shape, can't shoot straight, has some lingering psychological issues with his past, but M still believes in him even amidst an investigation of her efficiency as their leader by the bureaucrats in Parliament.<br /><br />To summarize Craig's performance without spoiling much else, it comes down to the way he plays the whole ordeal out. Frankly, he (the character) looked like crap when he came back. I mean, physically and mentally: he had a scruffy looking beard growing, he wasn't as witty or verbally sharp as he had been in the first two movies, and it took him a while to get his stride back. But when he does, it's pretty bad-ass. The real joy in it, though, is seeing him fall into such ineptitude and rising back to prominence. Meanwhile, to fill the gap in-between this resurgence is the amazing job by Javier Bardem as the villain. If you haven't seen No Country For Old Men yet, then you haven't seen what Oscar-worthy performances are made of. He was scary and menacing in No Country. But here, he's scary, crazy, and plain-out creepy. I love the fact that Bond actually has a formidable villain to battle this time around as opposed to just \\"sneaky, under-handed thinkers with bad intentions.\\" Bardem's character provides such a striking contrast in character and has so much screen presence, that I really can't think of how any of the next movies will top this.<br /><br />And then to compliment all that kick-assery character dynamic is the presentation. Bourne and Bond lovers, rejoice. Skyfall is the perfect balance of the old school and new school. The film is as freshly-analytical as Bourne, but with just the right amount of vintage Bond elements to create this wonderful infusion of new and old. It's gritty, cerebral, and dark,yet flashy enough, very stylish in certain parts (love that night fight in the Shanghai building!), and contemporary in respect to the old Bond movies. Yes, Ms. Moneypenny and Q are re-introduced. But the beauty is that it's very subtle and underplayed, almost like a quirk more so than an homage. No, there aren't a whole bunch of gadgets, and we'll see what the future holds if Craig can churn out another 2 or 3 movies. But yeah, like I mentioned about Mendes' Road to Perdition being a movie about generations, his talent in handling such material really shows through Skyfall. If you've yet to see Perdition, then do so. It will help the themes and undertones of Skyfall seem a little more apparent.<br /><br />In terms of the technical aspects. I really enjoyed.. well, everything. The cinematography by Roger Deakins (who should've won an Oscar by now, dammit) is stellar. Action scenes have a wider lens to them, even more so than Casino Royale, and a lot more than Quantum of Solace. Gone are the Bourne-like fast-cutting edits of Quantum. Things are a little more static, with minimum zooming to give the scope of the film that big, grand Bond effect fans have been clamoring for. The film was shot digitally with mostly Arri cameras and even the Red Epic on some of the action scenes. The opening sequence and song by Adele are spectacular, and the score by Thomas Newman has a great mix of electronic and orchestral pieces (again with the theme of new and old school fusion). Actually, listening to the score while typing this, I hear a lot of influences: lots of Bond theme, a little bit of Bourne-type percussion, a little Dark Knight brass dynamics, and some occasional string and piano for the build-up/calmer moments.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't think Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace could be topped (by the way, I consider those as one big movie, not a sequel to another). In fact, after what both of those movies did, I didn't think old-school Bond would be as appealing tome thereafter. I was wrong. Skyfall goes above and beyond by not only elevating the character of James Bond, but also bringing back what made the franchise popular in the first place. Craig has been and still is my favorite Bond, and Bardem is easily my favorite villain. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about all the stuff I mentioned and how I can't say more about it because 1) it'd be way too long, and 2) spoilers are bad. If you're reading this and take my words to be enticing enough, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. And yes, I believe Craig can make at lest 2 more movies, maybe even 3 if he stays in shape and they don't make the sequels any more physically demanding. Thanks for reading, and don't forget to watch this in a good theater. The one I went to (AMC Stonebriar) used a Sony 4K projector, but had an absolutely terrible scratch on the screen that's quite noticeable.<br /><br />Overall score: 5.0 / 5.0
B009AMANBA|5.0|For all of the fine films made about Abraham Lincoln over the years, Steven Speilberg's Lincoln presents us with, arguable, the finest film portrait.  The focus of the film is the pivotal last four months of Lincoln's life, the culmination of the civil war and the search for a way to heal the divided country.  The main focus of the film is the passage of the 13th amendment to end slavery.  However, there are other struggles in film in Lincoln's personal life (focusing on his son Robert's (sensitively played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt0) desire to become a soldier) and the president's feelings on the terrible losses of the war and the question of how to proceed with the place of the freed slaves and how to bring the divided nation back together. Although a narrow focus, Lincoln gives us a full portrait of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis has given us a very human Abraham Lincoln displaying his humor, his political acumen and his family tragedies.  He also seems a tired man, weary after four years of war that he seen a level of destruction and casualties on an unprecedented level.  Mr. Day-Lewis brings Lincoln to life showing him playing political hardball with the Southern delegation and attempting to deal with his emotions as he deals with family issues.  Sally Field gave a full and convincing portrait of Mary Lincoln, still distraught after the death of their young son Willie but able to insult Thaddeus Stevens at a White House reception.<br /><br />Equally astonishing is the part Thaddeus Stevens plays in the passage of the 13th amendment (marvelously portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones).  Stevens is a firebrand politician, violently abolitionist who come s around to compromise to see the amendment passed.  Mr. Jones brings real passion to his portrayal of Stevens, and for all of his hardness we also see the softer side of Stevens when he takes the House copy of the amendment home to show to his \\"housekeeper.\\" The turbulent politics of the period are well represented in the debate in the House of Representative that becomes a lesson in civics for us all.  This is well represented by the trio of arm-twisters hired by Secretary of State Seward to ensure there are enough Democrat votes.  The trio actors often played with great humor by John Hawkes, James Spader and Tim Blake Nelson show us how things are done in the 1860's.<br /><br />The large supporting cast for Lincoln have some truly memorable performances.  Secretary of State William Seward is beautifully played by David Strathairn,  Lincoln's secretary John Nicolay is sensitively portrayed by Jeremy Strong) and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton is memorably played by Bruce McGill especially when he snaps at Lincoln, \\"No, you're not going to tell a story.  I can't bear to hear one.\\"<br />Mr. Spielberg recreates the period so very well.  The White House and other Washington venues were painstakingly recreated.  Lincoln's office was re-created with painstaking accuracy.  Much credit is owed to the production designer (Rick Carter) and costume designer (Joanna Johnson) for turning back the clock.  The costume designers and the actors themselves convincingly conducted themselves as people from the period with their look and manners.  Some of the reviews I have read prefer the mini-series to this film as being a more complete portrait of Lincoln.  I think the film needs to be appreciated and judged on its own merits.  A film is a limited form of communication where an hours long television series can afford details.  There may be events and anecdotes some feel needed to be included but this does not limit the power of Lincoln.nted in the debate in the House of Representative that becomes a lesson in civics for us all.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this series...this has started a whole new genre I now love.  Really hope she re-writes from his point of view!!
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I grew up when Tom Selleck was doing his Magnum PI series.  Never thought about him much since.  Recently discovered Tom's other movies, including this one.  Wow, what great acting and stories.  Highly recommend this Jesse Stone series.  Fantastic job by all involved.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I rented the movie unaware of the story line. I thought the story was captivating and the film was casted and produced well. If a movie drags it can lose me, but Hunger Games kept me engaged the whole time. Loved it..I give it 4.5 stars...can't wait for the next movie.
B002HC67U6|5.0|The tango scene alone makes this a movie to be watched over and over again.<br />Set in the thanksgiving weekend in New York, a perfect compliment after a heavy turkey dinner.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Oh yea...\\"No Strings Attached\\".  Mila vs. Natalie?  Natalie hands down.  If it hadn't just been done, this would have been a cute romantic comedy.  Justin Timberlake plays the character well, but I can just imagine that he is actually like this.  Ok.
B008EEHRAU|4.0|This was an extremely good adult movie,  I  would say, it would be better on a large screen but was not to bad on my computer.<br />Bjhj
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|So much violence and sexual violence at that.  I'm sure it adds to the story, but I can't stand to watch it.  Without it, I enjoyed the suspensefulness of the movie and the crime solving.  Interesting story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE THE BOOKS! Who doesn't? I enjoyed reading the first and second book, I am now on the third. So far so good.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I don't go nuts over most of these Pixar or other animated movies, but taken as a whole this movie was excellent. Interesting story, plenty of action.<br /><br />*SMALL SPOILER*<br />There was a fight between two bears that was excellent!
B0026SFEW8|4.0|Just watched this through the Xbox 360, rented the HD version. Quality was quite good, audio and video crisp and clear. The only issue I had was that the website claimed this was a 5.1 transfer of the original, but the subwoofer never kicked on from my reciever (set up in &#34;straight&#34; mode, which depicts exactly what the movie portrays with no processing by the receiver). Not really a problem for Grease, as it was never meant to be heard with a subwoofer.<br />Gave it 4 stars simply for the price of the rental... A little steep for the HD version. But still a fantastic movie.

The red slider is difficult to slide & overall, the item is bulky. Like other reviewers, I found the case itself to be sturdy, but what does it matter when you're stuck with dry wipes...that you cannot grab b/c the slider sticks?
B008OOYALE|3.0|all I can say is that I enjoy playing dragon story. I have an issue with teamlava games. they tell you its free. and yes you can play for free through the whole game but you can be charged through out the game. me and my cousin love this game a lot. its fun hatching new dragons and making your own village for your dragons. event though you can have all of what I explained there can be times when you are charged. if you want a certain habitat dragon ect. youhave to pay almost 500 gold bars.yet if you want gold bars to buy that perticular item you have to pay to get thoose gold bars. now I understand how they get 1 star and 5 star but ithink it is an okay game.
1476704163|4.0|Kesha's book is really an extended tour book, jammed with previously unpublished family photos and photos from the road.  The theme of the book is simply stated \\"be yourself, unapologetically, always\\".  Kesha details her upbringing, emphasizing her drive and dedication to succeed in the music business.  Here is what makes Kesha different from you and me: she dropped out of high school after being accepted to Ivy League colleges to chase her dream of being a successful songwriter and performer.  Ask yourself, would you have the guts to do this?<br />Musical from birth, Kesha developed her \\"dance pop/rock n' roll\\" image over a few years and set out to produce dance pop presented in a rock and roll, party-hardy style that you could both dance and bang your head to.  She knows exactly who she is and what her place in the music world is and apologizes for absolutely nothing.<br />She clearly states throughout the book that it is extremely important to her that her career continue, that she expand upon the successes of her first album \\"Animal\\", and that she continue to tell her fans it's ok for them to be different and themselves.<br />Rock can always use someone who is unique and loves a big beat, and the message that individuality is ok can never be stated enough.  The text in the book can be read in an hour or two but is sufficient to give you a clear image of who Kesha is in 2012: a creative songwriter and musician who is having a blast and wants us all to loosen up and have a little more fun too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1476704163 My Crazy Beautiful Life]]

0152023984|3.0|The Little Prince is one of my favorite works of literature.  I was looking for feedback on the pop-up version, because, well, I never imagined the book as a choice subject for a pop-up.  And I came across of a lot of negative feedback about a new translation by Howard, the current version in the market for the regular non-pop-up books.  I read the new translation by Howard and it was well, faster paced than I remembered and not as intricately written... and then I compared to my personal collection's 1982 hardcover translated by Woods in 1943, and wow, what a difference!  The Woods translation is so much more lyrical and beautiful.  Reminds me of my complaints when I read English translations of Spanish literature that was lyrical and poetic in its original language, but lost all the beauty in the translation.  The new Howard translation is simpler in sentence structure and definitely easier to read, and although the general plot is conveyed well, it misses the mark.  The Howard translation makes it another great story but you lose the subtleties that made the story so beautiful.  It is as if the publishers and translator wanted a piece of time tested literature modernized to be mainstreamed.  Now, I don't read French, so I can't speak to the true spirit of the original French version, which Howard claims his is true to.  Bottom line is, if you want an easy to read great story, get the Howard translation.  If you want a piece of literature and teach your children beautiful writing, then find the Woods translation.  I would say that the Howard translation may be appropriate for my 6-yr old, whereas the Wood translation would be something I would wait until my child is 10 or even 12.  But on the other hand, my 6-yr old is so sensitive that I do not think the ending would be appropriate for him until he is older, if you remember how the Little Prince returned to his world... so personally, I would stick to the Woods translation.<br /><br />Now, does anyone know if thepop up is any good and which translation it uses?  I guess I'll have to take a trip to the library to find out!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I enjoy pinbal because it includes ability and talent. If you don't have eye and hand coordination, it would be difficult to play.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Teriffic casting, top notch production and a convincing performance from all the cast. Just a great story that looks and feels like a movie production and not a made for TV series. Recommended for anyone that enjoys a well told story with interesting and enjoyable characters.

0316228532|5.0|I'm a little perplexed by the mixed reviews this book is receiving.  I was never a Harry Potter fan, although my children devoured the books (I found myself disturbed by his bratty messiah complex), and I opened this book with no real expectation of pleasure.<br /><br />A day later, groggy from lack of sleep, I lay it down in astonishment and admiration.  Man, it's a cracker!  And its brilliant construction and subtle bite make it for me an almost perfect literary offering, well and away justifying Ms. Rowling's fame.  If this is what she can give us adults (now that she's got the cash to try), than bring on more!<br /><br />In \\"The Casual Vacancy\\", a petty feud, a few offhand decisions and more than one town councillor's whimsical egotism set off a chain of events that, in a completely unforced plot, take contemporary bickerings over class, place and time to their awful logical extreme.  The results for at least one family in the village of Pagford are shocking and deadly.  Ms. Rowling's politics and sympathies are leftist, but PLEASE do not let this put you off (if it would).  She's far too smart a writer for simplification. I'm as libertarian as they come, and I was dazzled by Rowling's inability to let ANYONE off the hook in this book, which is as sure a modern tragedy as Sophocles or Shakespeare ever wrote in their times.<br /><br />And her language!  I kept marking passages for this review, hoping to include them.  I gave up.  There were too many.  Her wit isn't acerbic, it's downright acidic.  I found myself awfully glad I don't live in the same village as Rowling's...with her ability to observe every character's strengths and all-too-evident foibles, I'd be terrified of her!<br /><br />I'm sure others have more ably synopsized the plot--read their reviews if you're unsure if giving Ms. Rowling more money this time around is a good idea.  But take it from a woman who has been reading for 45 years--there's precious little ART out there.  I thought the day of the true novel was over.<br /><br /> But this book blew me over with its fireworks.  With its flawless construction, thoughtful characterization and wicked black humor--and compassion--this book literally kept me up all night.  How's that for art?  As Rowling's feral character Krystal Wheedon would say (after she takes the cigarette out of her mouth), \\"Pre-ey effin' RARE.\\"<br /><br />If they're not teaching this in High School AP English in a year, I'd be very much surprised.
0345803485|4.0|First things first.  What is seriously lacking here are reviews from guys on this book.  Therefore, I'm going to provide one.  This will probably be the best review you have ever read, but that is just an added bonus.<br /><br />Second - this is not \\"hard core porn\\" as some reviews have stated.  Stop it.  What rock have you been living under?  If you think this is hard core porn, then you are missing a heck of a lot.<br /><br />So - Before getting into the meat of this thing, I must first delight you with a short story of how I encountered a copy of 50 Shades of Gray at one of the local adult novelty shops.  So there I am doing my daily shopping and what do I see on the counter?  A paperback copy of 50 Shades of Gray.  \\"Hey\\" I say to the woman working the night shift behind the counter of an adult novelty shop... \\"I see you have 50 Shades of Gray.\\"  She responded by telling me that she had begun reading it herself and that she had many customers coming in to buy items mentioned in the book.<br /><br /> \\"Really...\\" I respond, \\"I hear that the book is very popular.  Especially among women.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes\\" she replies and ads that she thinks every man should read it.  She goes on to tell me that one of her friends has her \\"biker\\" boyfriend reading the book.  I found it interesting that she chose to distinguish a regular \\"boyfriend\\" from a \\"biker boyfriend\\"... perhaps a topic for another day...<br /><br />At this point, another woman comes over to take a look because she overheard our conversation.  She is middle-aged, really rough looking, and has some sort of insertable egg vibe in her hand.  She looks at the display copy of 50 Shades like it is a strange alien artifact.  She hesitates and then lightly touches it - almost like she is afraid that the book is an old manuscript that will flake away if she is too harsh.  Then she carefully peels back the cover a bit as though there would be something interesting to see in there...a motion similar to that of picking up adead bird by the wing before flinging it into the neighbor's yard.  All this while casually holding her egg vibe in the other hand as though it was just a garden tool.  \\"Gonna go dig me some carrots!\\"<br /><br />Back to the book - So what message does a guy get from this book?  If you are rich enough and good looking enough, she will do ANYTHING.  Just come up with any crazy sex stuff you can think of and go for it.  The main character, Ana, has no interest in the \\"nice\\" guys she meets, but when the rich, handsome, and mysterious Christian Gray turns up she goes from a virgin to a sex starved BDSM nympho in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Would Ana let anyone else do these things to her?  Heck no... they don't have enough money.  They don't run a company or have a helicopter.  How does she justify it?  A classic female mind trick - but he is really a nice guy!  See, he wants to feed the poor!  He had a rough childhood!  Besides, he can't help himself around me... he makes me feel special... it's not his fault...<br /><br />Hey - more power to the guy.  That's fine with me.  If I had unlimited wealth I'd probably be a freak too (or at least more of a freak anyway).  My point is simply that this book basically just proves every theory men already have regarding female behavior... which is further reinforced by the glowing reviews drooling over how wonderful Gray is.<br /><br />Now... now... now... I can already hear the counter arguments milling about in your mind.  But Moondonkey, it isn't that Gray is wealthy or good looking... it is his attitude, how he holds himself, how he treats Ana, and his Alpha male personality.  He is such \\"man\\".  Uhhhhh... no.  Take away the money and fame and turn Gray into just some guy at the office.  Same guy.  Same character traits.  Does he get away with the same stuff?  No.  Not a chance.  Now he isn't a mysterious manly man, he is just a perverted jerk.  Right ladies?  If any \\"regular\\" guy pulls out some Ben-Wa Balls, slips then in, then commands you to go get a glass of water, I suspect that your reaction would be different.  If the guy from IT or Accounting takes you home after a date to see his Room of Pain how is that going to go over?  Yeah... I thought so...  Add several million dollars and a corporate helicopter... \\"ohhh... ok ... whatever you want...(bite your lip)...\\"<br /><br />You can tell this book was written by a woman because she has Gray's motivation all wrong.  According to the author, Gray does what he does out of a need for control.  There are various psychological issues involved in that, but the nutshell according to the author is control.  Ahem... speaking as a guy... it's not about control.  Do you want to know why a guy like Gray does what he does?  BECAUSE HE CAN.  That's why.  This isn't rocket science.  There isn't some deep motivation or purpose.  Gray is rich.  Gray is handsome.  Gray is powerful.  As Ana's mom reminds her, men are simple.  What do rich, handsome, and powerful men do with their wealth and power?  They get laid, that's what they do.<br /><br />Anyway - 50 Shades of Gray is really all about what is going on inside the woman's head.  How do I feel?  How does he make me feel?  Why do I feel like this?  Should I feel like this?  Is it wrong to feel like this?  But I like feeling like this... does that make me dirty?  Am I dirty?  What would people think?  What do I think?  What does he think?  What am I thinking?  He is so mysterious... he is so dangerous...  why would he want me?  Does he want me?  Do I want him?<br /><br />Blah...blah...blah... shut the heck up and get to the action already.<br /><br />So why read it?  Why the heck not I suppose.  I read a lot of books... the majority of which are terrible.  Many reviews comment on how poorly this book is written.  Yeah, it is.  So what?  Have you read anything else recently?  I bet 80% of the books out there are garbage.  Therefore, why not take a flyer on something like this?  Besides, the book isgetting a lot of press lately so why not check it out and see what all the cackling is about.<br /><br />The \\"action\\" takes awhile to get started.  You have to get 80 pages in before the hot skin slapping starts.  In tracking the action, I noticed that Christian Gray uses the zombie \\"double tap\\" method of sex.  You may recall that in order to make sure a zombie is dead after the first shot, you should always shoot it in the head a second time (a double tap) just to make sure.  Well... that is the way Gray has sex with Ana.  He does her once, then goes back for a double tap soon after.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me - on page 101, Gray kisses Ana after she performs oral sex on him (with a happy ending).  Sorry - no dude is going to do that.  Not happening.  You might as well be reading a Star Trek novel at this point because traveling at warp speed through space is more likely.<br /><br />Soooo... the big elephant-in-the-room question here is why this book appears to have struck a cord with women... or at least a significant number of women.  Apparently, 50 Shades of Gray allows women to safely explore their inner slut (even though the book is pretty tame really - go read a Hustler and compare).  Except here is the problem ladies - why do you need a stupid book to do that?  Your boyfriend or husband would surely be happy to explore your inner slut, but he probably gave up hope.<br /><br />In the end, I found the book sort of boring.  I could write better sex scenes.  Personally, I'd give the book only 2 stars.  However, my wife also read the book and the results forced me to rethink my rating.  I'm going to give it 4 stars - pretty much based on nothing but the \\"extra\\" benefits.<br /><br />Is that worth an extra 2 stars?  Heck yes it is!  I don't have a million dollars and a helicopter (yet).

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I got what I asked for, and that's all that I'm looking for. The DVD came in perfect condition, everything works perfectly. The only thing was the packaging (shipping boxes) were a bit too sticky and it took a while to open.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I've been playing Dungeon Hunter 3, since I've had my Kindle Fire. This game in a great dungeon crawler, pardon the pun. A good selection of classes to play. Male and female versions too. Coloecing gold to buy nice item to level up as you go deeper into this new world of places and monsters. Ranging from little Goblins to bigger boss type dragons. Each place has a number of goals to gain the maximum experiance and gold.<br />Now there is a new update for fusion of potions and more online and local multiplayer. Go with friends or new people who wish to explore this world of Dungeon Hunter 3. Great rewards await you.<br />P.s. Some items will require real world money. You need a chalange don't use them unless you really need them. Tis still a great game.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|This is the fifth and last book in the Adrien English mysteries series and what a ride it has been! it's such an unbelievably good series any way you want to look at it. It is again a very good mystery. More than that though, for me, this book has provided the emotional closure needed after the events of the previous books in the series. If you had questions for Jake's character, and i had quite a few..., you will get answers. The answers are not always easy, but they are straightforward and truthful.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this series enough! - smart mysteries with a wonderful sense of humour, and extremely well developed and evolving characters.

Though I am a fan of Pixar and have seen almost every movie, I tended to stay away from the Toy Story series because I was worried that it was overhyped.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />It's a lovely heartfelt movie about accepting change and coming together with the people you find yourself with.  Also, it has a Joss Whedon co-written script and a heavy dose of humor for kids and grown ups alike.

B0012250IM|5.0|The movie is a family classic, and I can easily see the soundtrack becoming a favorite. Not all the songs seem to be in the movie, but there still well within the Christmas theme, and fun to listen to.. As the songs play you can visualize the images in the movie where the song is heard.. This is definitely one of those soundtracks that warms the heart during the holiday season.. Edifies the joy of Christmas by encouragement of \\"I Believe\\" I can see a few songs that could of been added, such as the instrumental that would inspire images when these words are spoken and then the sound of the bell can be heard? If you have the soundtrack, you will probably want to buy the movie, if you have the movie, the soundtrack is a good addition to the tradition.. Both are great to enjoy with a cup of hot chocolate!!!

B0098VYKSA|2.0|The movie was decent for the first half, but I found the second half to be boring and drag on for way too long. This would have been far better if it was about half an hour shorter. Unfortunately the bulk of the plot and most of the important events of the film take place in the second half, so it's just kind of a disappointment. I was hoping for an exciting reinterpretation of this story, but this was not it.

1936608618|5.0|My past has been in the endurance sport realm...a soccer player, a mountain biker, a cyclist, a runner, a mountain junkie (hiking, climbing, etc).  I wish I would have had this book years ago.  Myself, like many endurance athletes, have put in miles upon miles upon miles on the bike and running.  I have trained with the attitude of the more volume the better.  In the last several years I have shifted that mentality with my own research and experience, but this book explains it all and WHY we need to train smarter, not harder.  Endurance athletes are one of a kind...we just keep going.  But over time that continued, \\"go, go, go\\" will leave us broken and away from what we all love to do.  Brian MacKenzie and Glen Cordoza have developed a resource for all athletes and coaches that will make them better.  They will feel better, they will perform better and their bodies will look like athletes, not broken down skin and bones.  Power, Speed, Endurance: A Skill-Based Approach to Endurance Training is the whole package.  It touches on every aspect of training for endurance sports in a safe, smart and effective manner.  Thank you both for bringing to light the truth behind endurance training.  If you don't have this book in your training resource library you are missing out!  Get it NOW!
0446580848|2.0|I really have enjoyed previous DeMille books and John Corey's smart mouth. However, The Panther goes on and on for 90% of the book before it got interesting and a page-turner. It was interesting to learn something of the history of Yemen and the native culture, but that's not why I buy a 'thriller' novel. On the positive side, Corey's outdid himself with his smart mouth, maybe even too much; but it did add to this otherwise boring tail. Come on DeMille, you can do a lot better.

B009E2U7L2|5.0|Not only did the X Factor give us one of the best boy bands ever, One Direction, they also gave us Cher Lloyd who is awesome! I can't say enough of about this album. I love every song. Want U Back is just so catchy and I can't stop listening to it. Her new single Oath is awesome as well and will be a hit on the radio. My favorite out of the others is probably Grow Up. I recommend this album highly.
0345529057|3.0|These books are great but I have noticed that the pages come loose easily. I have taken these on several trips and they do get beaten up but I have had to tape several pages back in to 2 of the 4 books. This is not a problem I typically encounter with paperbacks, it seems like the binding isn't the best. For the price they are definitely worth it, just be careful!

B005NJU8PA|4.0|[edited] I'm nowhere near the end of this book. But I've done two of the assignments, my first attempt at real cooking in decades, and the food has earned rave reviews.<br /><br />Some background: I purchased the Four Hour Workweek; still have it, but never read it. I purchased the Four Hour Body, read most of it, but did not attempt anything - the book made for interesting reading, but I didn't feel inspired to play along. In fact, some of the more experimental adventures made me too squeamish (like sleeping only an hour a day). Even so, I found his writing accessible and some of his accomplishments very impressive.<br /><br />When he came out with the Four Hour Chef, I read the preview and found he was tackling a topic where I was fully willing to take the plunge with him, to act and not just spectate.<br /><br />One of the concepts I found intriguing in the Four Hour Body, slow carb, is expanded on in the Four Hour Chef, and put into detailed practice. And yes, there is much besides cooking in this book, but I bought the book specifically to get past my anxiety about cooking. I cooked when single, but for subsistence rather than pleasure; I rarely ventured beyond microwaved bulk items from Costco. I can follow instructions on cans and boxes, but I've given up on more than a few from-scratch cookbook recipes. I knew friends who took pleasure in cooking, but didn't know where to start on my own.  This book promised to provide that start.<br /><br />It takes many, many pages to get to to the first bit of actual cooking. There's a reason for this, and I stuck it through the introductory chapters on DiSSS and but I was impatient to get to it. Even so, I stuck it out through the DiSS and CaFE chapters and the daunting list of ingredients and utensils. I haven't made the Osso \\"Buko\\" yet because we didn't have a dutch oven (which arrived today). But the bonus-points meal, the chuck roast, came together quickly, and was a hit at dinner.<br /><br />The first meal we got to eat was the second lesson, scrambled eggs. Yes, I've made many batches of eggs in my life, but they were never \\"fancy\\" - just eggs and oil or butter or Pam, followed by catsup or salsa.  Here is where Ferriss' early chapters on learning to appreciate what's in your food, e.g. identifying the qualities of herbs and spices, etc. really paid off. The chapter gives a handy table of countries and the mix of flavors that define them. His cooking process for the eggs was far different from my usual, so I took care to follow the steps and notice the difference. My first batch was a bit bland; I went bolder on the second \\"North African eggs\\" attempt, and the next day went with a different combination. This is where the book earned its keep: I felt the confidence by then to experiment. More than a recipe, the book conveys key concepts and the reasons behind them; for me, this was crucial.<br /><br />Ferriss' claim to fame is breaking down successful skills and learning them quickly: languages, basketball, dancing - the 20% core skills that yield 80% of the results. Not a shortcut, but a solid foundation modeled on the principles key to success. He's also known for taking his body to the limit (4 Hour Body), \\"hacking\\" it in ways that sometimes worked well, and at other times - to put it mildly - did not. I read his second book as a combination of health guide, adventure, and cautionary tale. I'm glad that with this book he's walking the reader through a series of key skills in a more mundane field - skills that can be picked up in a short period of time, but which can produce great results from the very first meal.<br /><br />You may not follow every suggestion, and need not. I doubt I'll ever buy a sous-vide machine, and I'm not a wine or tea drinker and we have different musical tastes so his \\"pairings\\" didn't do much for me. But if you want to learn to cook, and other methods have failed, I'd recommend at least giving it a read to see if his approach resonates. At $5 for the Kindle version, it's a steal.  This book inspired me not just to want to learn to cook; it inspired me to start cooking. The results so far have motivated me to continue. My wife is thrilled with what I've served her the past few days. If you come for the cooking and decide to stay for his other advice, you may find that of use as well.he Kindle version, it's a steal.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much,  I had a hard time setting it down. I'm srious I cried like a baby @ the end&#62; I was execting the end to turn out that way. I was more accepting to someone else dying. I guess beacause this book made me so emotional, really on the  top of my list.

B00A6N7QIA|2.0|Think of pulp fiction, less than zero, swordfish, and Beach all mixed together into one.  Trying to compete with anyone of those great films (OK swordfish was not great) is a giant risk, but trying to be all of them is, well, not really doable.  Now the movie itself.  cliche, predictable and unauthentic.  The film puts too much weight on the characters and they all become larger than life, with a modern cutesiness that makes you cringe.  The idea that these heartless murderers are quirky and likeable just like me and you is deeply flawed and it doesn't work on screen.  Finally the narration by the girl throughout starts off well, but as you get to know her character on screen, her narrative doesn't match her personality at all.  It becomes annoying to hear her voice after a while.<br /><br />There are beautiful people, soft porn moments, and some funny lines and situations, that make it bareable to watch, but this is no classic.

0547884591|5.0|I'm addicted to learning, cooking, and experimenting, so this book was perfect for me. I've read Tim's other books with great pleasure, and this book continues to teach and entertain.<br /><br />Several of the recipes are things I will never try or cannot make due to lack of weird ingredients, and the outdoors recipes and molecular gastronomy will probably not interest many people, but the recipes I've made so far? Wow! The beef jerky was the first recipe I made, and the book was worth it for that alone. I'll be saving lots of money using this method for sure. The 'classics' are fantastic and simple, and Tim's advice on tools and tips to keep cleanup to a minimum inspired me to try more complex dishes.<br /><br />While it's so cheap (especially for such a huge, full color book), I'd definitley pick it up!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love my show, the 4th season was great! as for the DVD, all the extras are a lot of fun, I had a blast listening to the commentary on Cuffed.<br /><br />Plus the international shipping? very timely.

B0002XV30Q|4.0|Saint Saens is, in my opinion, one of classical music's more underappreciated composers.  This CD set, especially the first disk, will tell you why.<br /><br />Piano concertos #2 and #4, both on the first disk, are, to my knowledge, Saint Saens' most famous works and deservedly so.  Very melodic, memorable pieces.  I've also found that piano concerto #1 is a real pleasure, though one with which I was less familiar before I bought this CD set.<br /><br />The second disk, featuring piano concertos #3 and #5, is less engaging, I think.  Indeed, it's curious that the CD doesn't present the piano concertos in order.  It's almost as if \\"the good stuff\\" was purposely put on the first disk.<br /><br />The exception is Saint Saens' inventive and creative African fantasy at the end of the second disk.  This is a rousing piece of music that reminds me a lot of Gershwin.  It's track #8 on the second disk if you want to jump right to it when you put in the second disk.  That's what I find myself doing...

0060512806|2.0|I think Snowcrash was one of the best books ever written. Diamond Age was great but not as good.<br /><br />With that context, I came into Cryptonomicon with high expectations, and I was sorely let down. The prose was classic Neal Stephenson, and each sentence was sheer geeky fun to read. But overall big-picture, the story never came together.  I geeked out so much at various sections, where my favorite involved a 20-page (estimated) explanation of a math prodigy family's method for distributing an inheritance. But the story dragged along for over a thousand pages, rambling on and on. I kept thinking (hoping) it was some meta, self-referential joke where the rambling nature of the story was reflecting the crypto-analytic core of the story.<br /><br />But alas, no. After thirteen hundred pages or so of build-up and anticipation, waiting to see what would happen, the end just happened. In about 10 pages. I had to go back and double-check pages to make sure I didn't miss something.<br /><br />All I can say is this was a resounding disappointment. I found the whole thing to be a cruel, taunting joke. The prose, characters and dialogue were all great, but it all amounted to a colossal waste. Very sad.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love it. Wireless connection makes it useful. Also it has about 30 yard wireless coverage. The volume controls the PC volume entirely.
0547884591|4.0|Tim does it again with the 4-Hour Chef.  Great deconstruction of the basics of becoming a master in the kitchen, with some excellent recipes to boot!  Gotta try the Osso Buko if you haven't already - excellent.  I'm enjoying reading through the book and chuckling as I do so.  Tim's sense of humor is right on and makes the reading effortless.  This should help me stay motivated to keep with the Slow-Carb diet and learn more about acquiring some killer kitchen skills, as well.
B004NS710C|5.0|This was a great movie! Very suspenseful. Kept my attention the entire time. I would absolutely rent or buy it again!

B000YAA68C|5.0|This is a sweet story about love that transcends death. Hillary Swank is her usual terrific self and her GFs Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow are very complementary to her character. Kathy Bates and Harry Connick Jr are terrific support. Gerard Butler is, well, Gerard Butler. He's got great comic timing and is, of course, adorable.

0385737955|3.0|I really wanted to love this series.  I mean, it was on the NY Times Bestseller list, for Pete's sake!  But, I didn't love it.  I didn't even like it.  I kept waiting and waiting for the book to live up to its reputation, but it never did.  It started out weird and boring and stayed that way.<br /><br />When Thomas wakes up, the only thing he can remember is his name.  He doesn't know where he is or who he is.  All he knows is that he has to escape.  The entire book had one setting and I found myself wanting to escape it, too.  Thomas has landed in the Glade, a sort of perpetually moving bush maze with flesh-eating monsters.  The why of this is never really explained.  It's not very clear why this manic need to escape is in the story or why they have to desperately search the maze every day or, well, the 'why' of hardly anything is explained.  What is the point here?  Is it in the second book?<br /><br />It mostly reminded me of a modern day Lord of the Flies, another book I didn't love.  I just don't know if I have the gumption to sit through another book....I hope a lover of this series will step forward and tell me what I'm missing.
B007MJSYF0|4.0|Some viewers will be tempted to turn off this gore fest halfway through, but there actually is a worthwhile final act.  The real theme is how hidden survival instincts reveal themselves when all social rules disappear.  Some are willing to murder right away, some only when pushed, some reluctantly, and some not at all.  A deeper understanding of Japanese culture might have given me even more to reflect upon...or maybe not?
B009A87Z5G|4.0|I haven't purchased \\"Dead in the Boot\\" yet but i own the Japanese imports for the first 3 Elbow albums.

WOW!!<br />For now, i'll give this album 4 stars for the songs i already know and love by one of my favourite bands.
078401213X|3.0|I was willing to follow this unusual story anywhere, but it ultimately goes nowhere.  There have been much better movies about the fine line between genius and mental illness, alienation, paranoia, and city life in general.  There is a subplot about the place of jewish men in culture and technology, but even that fizzles out before it has really begun.  When you start with a weak script, the actors can only do so much.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|The experience I had viewing Snow White and the Huntsman was entirely unpleasant.<br /><br />I selected a seat about halfway up the steps of the theatre and just to the left of centre aisle. Typically, this is the ideal location when viewing a film. Unfortunately, the woman behind my on this occasion felt it appropriate to have not one, not two, but THREE cell phone conversations during the picture. I can understand if there were an emergency which necessitated her taking the call, but the calls -- from what I could deduce -- were from a relative of hers, discussing their Holiday plans (which were surely months away, at this point), and from a coworker during which she discussed the pros and cons of the employee which just joined their organization. In the third phone call, she had the nerve to complain about MY behavior during the film. Due to this woman I missed 8-10 minutes of the film.<br /><br />Additionally, I rarely purchase concessions while visiting the theatre due to their absurd prices. On this occasion, however, I decided to break that pattern and purchase some snacks, as I had eaten a very small breakfast that morning (I was running late to drop my son off, I memory serves). I was sad to find that the popcorn was overcooked and very dry. In addition, the bag of M&Ms I purchased had only 3 blue M&Ms (my favorite flavor). As you may imagine, having spent over $10 on these snacks, I was audibly perturbed by the quality of these snacks. As I had attended the film with my in-laws, I tried to keep any profanities to a minimum, but I rightly voiced my frustration over the quality of the concessions at this theatre. After a brief monologue (no more than 2 minutes) to other movie-goers on my row, the woman behind me began asking me to be quiet -- AFTER SHE HAD ALREADY TAKEN MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS DURING THIS SINGLE MOVIE!!! As you can tell, the experience was COMPLETELY unpleasant.<br /><br />The movie was fine.
B0019IIPXQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half and then it got sort of lazy.  There was room for more dialogue and character development.  It would have also been more interesting if different characters had lived and died, but it insisted on going against the audiences' expectations...trying too hard to set itself apart from every other \\"killer alien\\" or \\"stranded\\" action adventure.  It's still worth a rental for fans of this genre.
B001EBV0MG|5.0|Great classic movie!  Loved the whole movie from beginning to end.They don't make them like they used to.I know I will watch it over and over again.<br /><br />  .

B008FSCNTK|3.0|Diana Krall is one of the most extraordinarily gifted musicians of our time, both in the breadth and in the depths of her abilities.  This album is not bad at all, but it does not draw upon or display Diana's incredible talent.  Especially for Diana Krall, I actually found this album a bit dull.  Sizzling jacket though!  What a marvel this lady is: Julie London++++!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I must admit, when I first heard that Dylan was putting out another album I was not very thrilled. Following the logic of his second Renaissance (1997), I thought he would need about 5 years to create a classic like Modern Times. However, I am glad to say that I underestimated the man who one would think that after 50 years had no more tricks up his sleeves. In my honest opinion, \\"Tempest\\" is Dylan's best album since 1975. Everything about this album from the way it slowly descends, song by song, into the depths of darkness is a masterpiece. While the comparison to Shakespeare's play has been dubbed invalid by Dylan I think that he is not exactly a good source of his own work. Dylan has been known to mock the press ever since the 60s. Dylan sounds like he really may be at the end of the line on this album. On his darker songs such as \\"Tin Angel\\", \\"The Tempest\\", and \\"Roll On John\\", he makes frequent reference to death by the cutting the heart. These references may be allusions to his own fear of death considering his near-death experience with histoplasmosis in 1997. Dylan has never sounded so aged and afraid but yet this album contains no self-pity songs like those on \\"The Times They Are-A Changing\\".He sounds ready for whatever outcome presents itself. His narrative ability on this album is definitely at its height. I have heard virtually every album Dylan ever made and I have never heard such great storytelling on one of his records. He managed to employ many of the skills he developed later in his career with genius of his earlier work. Truthfully, I could go on for days about this album because i love it so much. I have a new favorite song off this album every month. People could fault him for his singing and plagiarism but I have never heard any of these songs which he supposedly quoted without permission and I think his singing is great for what he's trying to do. You;'re never going to hear Dylan sing the way he did on BOTT again because he's 71 years old now.However, I think he is still as great an interpreter of his own songs as he ever was. My only question is why so few people are covering his music now. I don't think this album should have been the #1 album in the country like MT but I think it is underrated at a time when quality music is waning. I sincerely hope it doesn't take Dylan's death for people to appreciate his contributions to music in his later career. If Dylan had died in '66, he would have already made enough material to solidify himself in the annals of popular music. To think that he has been rolling on for nearly 50 years after that and still outdoing himself is nothing short of miraculous. I only hope he can continue making more albums as good or better than this one for years to come.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I teach high school English. I got this book for my classroom library. I cannot keep it on my shelf. One of my students insisted that I read The Fault in Our Stars.

I think it is truly one of the best books I've read this year!
0385344333|1.0|I've read all of the Reacher books, and this one is simply the worst. It reads like a bad television script, and worse yet, it's boring. The plot is boring, the dialogue is boring, and the characters are boring.<br />Maybe it's time for Lee Child to take a long break. Bad enough that Tom Cruise is starring as Reacher in a movie-like a midget playing John Wayne.
0062127241|3.0|I would have enjoyed this book more if Pete would have given us a more vicarious experience concerning his life. This is not a &#34;tell all&#34; autobiography. Pete seems to hold back a bit on the behind the scene stories and the people that were with him and The Who. He's very open about his consequences in life, but hidden about specifics in getting there. Perhaps he's just a gentleman when it comes to exposing &#34;his generation&#34;?
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|Throughout the book he takes forever to get to his point.  I understand that as a person whose ideas are continuously under attack he wants to lay a solid bullet proof foundation but at least half could be saved for the notes.  An abridged version would be a delight to read.  This one fails to consider that many of us have other things to do and are desperate for concise narrative.
1608193381|3.0|The book is comprehensively written so that people with a less than advanced knowledge of economics may also find this an accessible read. The division into 23 short chapters covering different themes makes you go through it faster than with most popular economics books. The author covers the main aspects of capitalism and shows you in a persuasive style how some of the flaws of capitalism hamper the development of nations. For those short on time, the chapters can also be read independently from each other.<br /><br />Although not all 23 arguments are equally ground-breaking, the book succeeds in challenging conventional thinking about the capitalist system and international development and offers a fresh perspective on some of the general fallacies of the way our society is organized. Definitely a good read when you are interested in world affairs, (development) economics or working in the non-profit sector, but if you are looking for \\"Big Ideas\\" there are better books around.
B00881PPTO|5.0|To the guy who faulted the app because Kayak doesn't search Southwest or Alliegient air, that's not their fault! Some airlines simply don't allow it! This is a good app, and you can't blame them for something out of their control.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I love to unlock new people and those monkeys are fast so watch out I love this game it is so much fun
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I watched this with my kids, it was cute but not amazing. It was a So so story, animation was col though
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The premise was fascinating, and the descriptions of plantation life and slave families was compelling. However, I thought the main character not very believable. Her naiveté seemed contrived to suit the story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun to do in my free time but it is annoying when you have to play all those games just to get another one.
B0086449YA|4.0|I rated a few songs 5 on my iTunes rating system, most are between a 3 and 4. I own all of Mark's CD's and all of Dire Straits work
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This CD is a beautiful assortment of classical music to go along with the series of Shades of Grey books!
B0060D11OU|5.0|One of the best movies ever!!!  I love Mary Poppins and love the songs and singing! Highly recommend it to you!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really enjoy playing, I wish it was a little more intuitive regarding how to start new towns, etc. but overall a lot of fun.
030758836X|3.0|I thought this book would be much better.  I could not put it down, but that was mostly because I wanted to be done with it.  It had good elements, but I just never bought into the characters.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|just like so many others have stated, this app crashes immediately after you launch it.  I hope gameloft releases a fix for it soon.  till then I'm not purchasing any gameloft games.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! I have a major addiction to this show, so glad that Amazon carries it. My husband loves it too!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|DiCaprio almost never disappoints in any roll he plays --and this roll is no different. Every supporting cast member are also in tune with this movie. The story kept me eager to see just where it was going and I did not have a clue to how it would end until the last few minutes and even then I was still stuned. Good entertainment--give it a try.
0547884591|5.0|I just got this book and already have a ton of new ideas for how to break down, learn and teach skills. The recipes seem cool and all but the real value is in the skill development. I am a coach and these techniques can be used no only to better my self but those I coach as well. PS: the card memorization stuff is really awesome. I am working on my system now.
B003DT194G|5.0|Best western.  Music is great.  One of Henry Fonda's best movies I think.  Movie is not fast paced, so you can really enjoy it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Damn Channing Tatum is super hot in this!!! Total chick flick and definately my gulity pleasure, love it. love it!!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a really great app. I have never had any problems with it and you could play this thing forever
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I've listened to it as much as i listened to the Dixie Chick's &#34;Fly&#34; album when it was first released.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I was a little confused at first about this movie but It got better.  I really like how Charlize Theron played the part of the witch.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson captures an amazing story of who Steve Jobs is and how he began his journey to Apple-greatness. I was very excited to read this book and will definitely read it again. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a good well-rounded portrayal of the man behind the Apple.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There's a reason why Stephen King novellas make classic movies: they're more satisfying to read than most of his long novels.  Structurally, his shorter works just seem to hang together better.  The worst offender, and I think I'm not alone in this assessment, is IT.  I think 300 pages could have been cut from that one and nobody'd miss them.  THE STAND is a fun read, but it bogs down pretty badly about 2/3rds of the way through.  Reading later works like CELL and UNDER THE DOME are sort of like eating a whole French silk pie by yourself: it tastes good at first, later on you're wondering why you just don't stop and walk away, and when you're finished, you're left with a bloated feeling but nothing substantial to digest.<br /><br />Then you have 11/22/63.  Countless other reviews attempted to synopsize the story, so I won't bother.  All I really wanted to say about it is, for a long King novel, this one works, beginning, middle and end.  I won't say it doesn't START to bog down just past the halfway point, but it's not for long.  I think it's also a good novel for first time King readers, because it isn't a horror story.  It's just, to borrow a phrase, a ripping good yarn, and now replaces THE STAND in my personal list as the best King long novel ever.  Go.  Enjoy.
B00285K1KE|1.0|This movie was so incredibly lame and hard to follow. It was weird! I couldn't get into it at all. Not like I expected it to be. I guess my mistake was watching the Avengers, a really great movie by the way, before watching this one. I'll never get that time back and I'm more stupid for having watched it....
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I am Christian and like to understand other philosophies outside of the Bible.  The same agreements can be found in the Bible...just dressed up differently.
B007Y36K46|5.0|This movie was great! The special effects and characters were fantastic to watch. The first time I watched it I was a little confused, but the second time I caught enough to where I knew what was going on. I highly recommend this movie.
B00881PPTO|1.0|Even with it being free today, I'm quite reluctant to give it the permissions it asks for. It appears to be way overboard.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a great movie and my kids love it! Pixar and Disney knock another one out of the park with this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down and my 3year old was really good for letting me read it.. can't wait til the 3rd one...
B007SSDS24|2.0|This movie was no good. It was hard to follow and really left me wondering why I even watched it. The best parts of it were in the trailer. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the special effects are pretty cool. Story line, not so much.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|All I ever got to see was the original pilot for this series.  Finally, about 2 years ago, got to watch it on a free online TV show site.  I don't think I got to see every single one of the series, but I got to see most of them.  Now, I can watch them whenever I please AND I have closed captioning for hearing impaired, which none of the onine TV show sites had.  Was a relief to FINALLY  KNOW what people were ACTUALLY saying!  =)
B005LLSZNM|5.0|What to say about SOA...<br /><br />Well, I'm not normally into these types of shows. I don't like crooked cops and I like criminals even less, but holy smokes! I watched the first episode and I had to watch the next and then the next and so on and so forth. Now, I would not have purchased this season because I don't know how many times I will watch it over and over again, but I could not leave SOA and not see where the story was going. The season wasn't free...yet. So I purchased it. I'm not sorry I did, but then a week later Prime put it out for free. Oh well. I'll be purchasing Season 5 when it comes out...<br /><br />Very few shows get you rooting for the bad guys or leave you at the end of the show wondering what's going to happen next. That was the problem. I would watch one episode and the way it ended would force me to watch the next one. That's the way it went until I finished season 4.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|My only complaint is I need the hours back that I spent flying and landing!  Great app!  Everyone should own this app!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie! I love how Stark, Thor, and Captain America were the same actors from the other movies. I wish they had done that with the Hulk. Maybe then The Hulk movie would not have been so horrible. That's another story.<br /><br />This movie rocked and I purchased it without question. I've watched it several times and will certainly watch it again in the near future.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I bought this game for 99 cents which was a fair price for it.  While the game had some very nice hidden object games and some challenging puzzles it also required an enormous amount of running back and forth between scenes collecting one item at a time.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys spending 80% of your gamming time running through the same 14 scenes then this game is for you!  And (as mentioned in MANY other reviews!) the ending sucks!  After playing the game to it's final scene you NEVER get an explanation for all the mysterious goings on.  What a disappointment!  For 99 cents it's not a bad deal but if you're paying more than that for it you're being robbed!
B004DZXC30|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie, but after watching it I figured it was on my short list of watching again. So, being a member of Prime, I purchased the digital version for my Prime account.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie as did the rest of my family.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My husband has one complaint - the relationships or background of the situation that the world was in is not explained well enough. Not everyone reads books and will watch the movie first, so the relationships and background should have been more in-depth. Otherwise, we both loved the movie and look forward to the next one.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Enjoyable movie.  Not the best, but entertaining.  Loved the music and Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin are great in it.  Definitely worth seeing.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|We viewed this movie after thanksgiving dinner utilizing 3 generations of family.  Only one person fell asleep out of about 10.  I call that a good ratio!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I too think that season 3 is the strongest one so far.  The surprises just keep coming.  The only things I've seen so far that seem kind of weak: (spoiler)<br /><br />When Rick answered the phone at the end of Say the Word, I cracked up and laughed out loud with delight!  What an awesome ending!  Then, in the next episode, when you find out that it was just a nervous-breakdown hallucination on Rick's part - lame.<br /><br />Also, can Andrea really be that stupid?!?!<br /><br />But every series is going to have a few weak spots here and there.  Still the best series I've seen in a long time!
B009329ZF2|3.0|If plot isn't a concern and you can FULLY suspend your disbelief ... go ahead, watch it!<br />If you're hair requires washing, and you don't want to deal with obnoxious lead actors, timelines that don't compute, and extremely poor transitioning between scenes, you should probably just concentrate on hygiene rather than risk wasting your time.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have been playing Settlers for years, and this is a must have for any board game lover. Relatively simple to learn, but very complex in terms of strategy! A must have for family game night. I would highly recommend this product.
B00005JLF5|3.0|besides the opening episode, tying the show to the best of both worlds epic.<br /><br />DS9 season 1 is slow and boring....I know characters have to be introduced and it was a new setting.<br />DS9 had some growing up to do.....still is a good series though, and essential for the trek library
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I think Stieg Larson is a little wordy, but the story is a good read.  I enjoyed the whole trilogy.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|The item was as described packaged well shipped fast. Brand new in the package and exactly what I expected. thanks
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is my favorite holiday movie!  Great for families and adults.  I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, but this movie is great!
B008KE3960|5.0|This is well worth putting on your tablet great graphics and fun to play.<br />Even handy for my dad to play, problem is he wont let me have it back.....
B0091574VI|4.0|Well done story and message for both adults and children! :)  Unique bonding of males is very special to watch..
B005LAIHZY|3.0|We purchased this movie sight unseen because it was Pixar. We expected it to be as excellent as their other animated films (Cars - the first one, Toy Story, Up, etc). It isn't. I'm not really sure why it got such high ratings.<br /><br />Yes, the main character is fun, she's strong, she's witty, she has a mind of her own. Still, the overall storyline is weak in many ways. And really, although it was presented differently in this film, a family member turning into a bear has been done (remember Brother Bear?).<br /><br />The voice actors were well chosen, the animation itself is absolutely beautiful, but we certainly wish we had rented this before purchasing. Next time we'll know better.<br /><br />I agree with those who say that Pixar isn't what it was prior to the Disney merge, but really, did anyone expect it to be? I know I didn't. It's really too bad. Pixar had a great thing going. They were 'old style' Disney, something I think Walt would have been proud of. Maybe the next attempt will be better.<br /><br />Would I recommend Brave? Sure, it's good enough entertainment, but I do suggest renting, not buying.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is decent but the credits are pricey and the cash is nearly useless because anything of real value can only Be purchased with said credits.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|What a great CD. I've had the vinal for years and wore it out. The songs are all great and Roy Orbison, my favorite singer, is his usual terrific self. Well worth having in you're collection. Best, John R. Tracy
B0020M99LC|5.0|Daniel Craig's first film Its one of the best. The video quality was great, 720p and with a decent internet connection, does not stop at all.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Everyone in our family loves to play it.  It gets pretty challenging after you get into it and then sometimes my grandson gives up and asks me to help me!  Lots of Fun!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I am an addict. It can be addicting just like sims but easier because all you do is collect coins and spend it.  The challenge is not toactually purchase anything with real money. Do not be fooled with the sales.  Very easy game to play.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great Price, picked it up on sale at Amazon for $19.99 can you beat that for every version of the films released lots of great extras that have not been put on previous special editions and a true classic set of films.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great product for the price<br />I do recommend it<br /><br />And I am putting this extra words because I need to so I am allow to click submit :)
0374214913|5.0|I don't want to spoil the book for other readers, so let me just say that the book is a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />This is a book that deserves a Hollywood movie to bring it to life. I hope it gets translated into Hebrew and Spanish for different sets of friends of mine to read.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Inevitably, this was always going to get a huge level of interest from critics, and it would have had to have been outstanding to stand up to expectations.<br />Overall, some good story-lines and it's quite compelling.<br />The characterisation is more soap-opera than real life; there is a fair bit of stereotyping, and they're not very convincing. That said, it's not a book that is written for deep characterisation and it's not supposed to be high-brow. It's an easy read, with lots going on, and it keeps the pages turning.<br />Don't expect anything that gets you thinking, but good for a holiday read.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This classic Disney movie is a must have for a good choice for children and for grandchildren.<br />It is good to have it in DVD form instead of VHS.
