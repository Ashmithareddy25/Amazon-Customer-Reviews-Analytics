B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Very interesting book and well written.  The characters were believable and the story had its share of twists and turns.  Most of our group really liked the book and there were a couple who didn't think it was that good - thought it was okay.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The author's approach to this book is definitely unique and intriguing - it is narrated by &#34;Death&#34; (the proverbial dark-hooded, invisible-faced scythe-weilding character).  But honestly, he comes off as more caring and observant than one would imagine.  So definite points for that. The main character (but not only) focus is Liesl, a young girl in Nazi Germany (seems like I'm reading a lot of books of this ilk lately, but only by coincidence).  Liesl is abandoned (well, force of financial and other circumstances) by her mother, and is placed with a family near Munich.  She has low expecations - which are generally met early on, and shows a strong and resilitent character. She makes the best of her lot which, from a family and friends perspective, evolves reasonably well and the portrayal of same is well-written and enjoyable. The book title is a recurring theme in her life - she loves books (even though initially she can't read), and her initiation into &#34;book thievery&#34; is a Nazi-sponsored book burning, where she rescues one unburnt, slightly charred tome. From there her book thievery continues - on random occasions, but the scope of the book is far larger than that.  My primary enjoyment out of this book was the intermittent observations by Death, Liesl's growing circle of friends, the darkening clouds of war and Nazi atrocities becoming visible in village life, and her courage, friendships, and resiliency in the face of daunting times.  Not many books hold my interest, but this one did from the very beginning and was both an enlightening and enjoyable read.  Strongly recommend.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore long before the health care &#34;debate&#34; began was doing seminal work in this area and the production should be seen by everyone especially the whinny Republicans trying so hard to defeat the Affordable Health Care Act!  NOT OBAMACARE!

B001JEPVDM|5.0|Some critics I've seen on here complain of the author's bias and lack solutions for genocides that occur all over the world. But he's not writing as a journalist. Or as a foreign policy analyst. He's written a memoir of what he saw and experienced as a witness on the ground during the genocide and civil war that took place in Rwanda in 1993-1994, as someone who was tasked to keep the peace and not given the means to do it. Who wouldn't come out of such an experience reeling with anger and contempt for the major powers for whom the resources to properly support peacekeepers are a drop in the bucket, but who chose not to? He understood how the Somalia debacle had soured the world on humanitarian missions in dangerous parts of the world, but took that as no excuse for the tepid and uninspiring response from the UN and just about everyone who could've helped, aside from the former colonial power, Belgium, and France who was visibly biased toward one side. He did seem to go easy on Canada toward the end (when troops and supplies finally start arriving and helping), but for much of it he seemed quite as frustrated with his own government as he did with everyone else's.<br /><br />He's bared his soul and told his harrowing story seemingly in hopes of getting across his lessons learned which he lists in the conclusion, including policy covering not just conducting peacekeeping missions and overseeing transitional governments properly but at preventing and mitigating the vicious cycle of rage and hate, violence and revenge, at its roots - that is to say sufficient and sustained aid toward health, education, employment.<br /><br />I do see how such things as country soveriegnty, delicate international business partnerships, and general public disdain for intervening forces which &#34;smack of colonialism&#34; as he put it, can complicate a unified response. But if member countries at the UN didn't make it so hard to work together, a lot of good could be accomplished under theblue flag and blue helmets (as opposed to the flag of one particular country or other willing to send troops).

B00DOPEGAS|3.0|its a good loom but the hooks are just so pointed and its a pain getting the rubber bands off. The rubber bands, because of this either snap or the whole bracelet gets ruined after a couple of them fly of when you are pulling the bracelet off the loom. its also pretty hard to do even the most basic bracelet with the hooks
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Say what you want about this being &#34;similar&#34; to Fifty Shades, but these books stand all on their own.  Sylvia Day has an amazing way with writing a story so that it totally sucks you in from line one.  I absolutely LOVED these stories and can't wait for the next one.
034544678X|5.0|This is a book I recommend to most of the students I help train for Operation Freedom Paws (we match shelter dogs with veterans and others with disabilities, and train them together to become service dog teams.) This book clearly describes some of the differences between humans and canines that make communication between us a challenge. Seems that dogs are more flexible than we are, and their patience with us is amazing! I refer to this often when I'm trying to figure out how to help a handler work more effectively with a dog.
B00AF46Q5Y|3.0|This is the second book in The Clifton Chronicles Trilogy.<br /><br />It is very much a continuation of the first; you really need to read Only Time Will Tell first to gain an understanding of the characters and sitiuations.<br /><br />The Sins of the Father was not as good as the first book. It jumped around a lot and was not a plausible as the first.<br /><br />Hope the third is better!

076790592X|4.0|A true story about the author and his relationship with his college professor, Morrie Schwartz, which is revived some 16 years after Mitch left college. Morrie has been diagnosed with ALS, a debilitating disease that leaves his &#34;soul, perfectly awake, imprisoned inside a limp husk&#34; of a body.<br /><br />Following their first Tuesday together, Mitch returns regularly every Tuesday to listen to Morrie's lessons on &#34;The Meaning of Life.&#34;<br /><br />Soon before Morrie's death, when his condition has deteriorated so much that he can no longer breathe or move on his own, he confides that if he could have another son, he would choose Mitch.<br /><br />A poignant and moving story, beautifully written.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I can't top Stephen King's review in the NYT book review, but I will echo his assessment.  Tartt brings a Dickensian sensibility and treatment into the 21st century. The flaws that prevent me from awarding 5 stars are minor -- I'd give 4.7 or 4.8 if I could. The length didn't bother me -- I loved Seth's A SUITABLE BOY which is nearly twice as long. Highly recommended -- as long as you don't drop it on your foot.
0385751532|4.0|Even though this book is about the Holocaust and Auschwitz, it is told through the eyes of a 9 year old german boy and hence cultivates a lighter and more innocent ‘fable-like’ approach to the atrocities that occurred. The boy, having no friends of his own to play with outside of Auschwitz, befriends a young jewish boy in the camp and what ensues is a friendship that destroys ethnic and religious boundaries and which ends in a final, cruel twist of fate.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|If you enjoy any of the monogram puzzles (like previous FAOTD Crossme or the other popular one called FlipPix) or if you also enjoy playing minefield you might like this one. Basically you are given a picture broken up into hexagons. The colors shown on each one represents the colors of each hexagon that surrounds it. So, for example, if all the dots are the same color then every hexagon that touches it will be that one color. Or if you have a hexagon and you can see that all the surrounding ones only have the color red in common then you know that is the color for it. There is a tutorial included in the options section. After going through that, as long as you remember the colored  dots represent the surrounding hexagons and NOT the hexagon it is on then it's not too hard.<br /><br />I am taking a star of because at times it either too hard to tell what ones you already have colored and/or once you have one colored it is hard to tell what color the dots are on that hexagon to know what the surrounding ones should be.
0525478817|5.0|Wow! This is such a beautiful book; clever, funny, sad. I learnt, I laughed, I cried.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars tackles the topic of teenage cancer and John Green deals with it brilliantly, unpretentiously and realistically. Cancer is real, it is hard, and it is life.<br /><br />The main character, Hazel, has Stage 4 thyroid cancer and spends her life in hospitals and hooked up to machines. She meets Augustus, an amputee and ex-basketball player, at a cancer support group and they immediately hit it off.<br /><br />Behind the cancer mask, this is a love story between two young people who are touching death. The book is about the journey that they take and how they live and love in the moment.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the themes of this book - it is a MUST read; an unflinching look at mortality.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I just got the app originally to show my wife but became addicted. I just cant put the game down.
819073914X|5.0|Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth.<br /><br />The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.<br /><br />During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary comes to an abrupt and silent end.<br /><br />Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.

B00CHVJODE|4.0|Loved this DVD, It was so cute and funny and very colorful.  I like to watch it after a stressful day and get a good laugh.
0375707972|4.0|This was a very difficult book to rate. I read it after watching the movie and, in this case, I think that was a mistake. I thought the film surpassed the book in bringing out the moral ambiguity of the story.<br /><br />The Reader is about 15-year-old Michael Berg, who has an affair with Hanna, a woman more than twice his age. One day she disappears, and he expects to never see her again. Years later, he runs into her at a trial where she is accused of a Nazi crime. Michael must then wrestle with the implications of their relationship and whether he owes her anything.<br /><br />This book is a classic that does deserve credit. The questions it raises regarding morality and accountability leave a deep and long lasting impression.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Opera lovers will love this performance.  Villazon and Netrebko are unforgetable.  Wonderful production, cast and music.<br />Must have DVD.  Full of fun and get singing.
B00D81ZYVS|4.0|A wonderful inspirational book from start to finish.<br /><br />James Bowen is a street musician in London, England. He found Bob in the spring of 2007, and the pair have been inseparable ever since.<br /><br />Yes, the cat is cute; yes the story is a simple one. But it’s genuinely revealing about the kind of life led by those labelled &#34;in the lower echelons of society&#34;. It’s a window on motivation – on how and why people who’ve apparently given up on themselves might finally be spurred to get their life together. And it is a lesson to all - NEVER judge a book by its cover!<br /><br />A Street Cat Named Bob is a moving and uplifting story that will touch the heart of anyone who reads it.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The entire novel is the narration of the character Theo, from childhood to age. Never have I gotten into the most subtle nuances of another mind.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I started reading this book after seeing and online recommendation. It took me a great deal of self control to not finish it in one seating, but I really wanted to enjoy it. Which I ultimately did.<br /><br />I loved the story, loved the \\"tense\\" moments with Levi and Reagan just kept reminding me of Megan, Felicity's roommate (from the  1998 tv series Felicity). She wasn't nice at first either....<br /><br />Anyways, I really enjoyed this book! And just loved loved loved it!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy playing this game but do not like the fact that it has a time out period.  After playing a board for 10-15 tries it is really annoying to not be able to play it for another, i.e. 28 minutes!  (I have problems with my hands and therefore it takes me a long time to clear each board)
030758836X|4.0|Everything started out perfect for Nick and Amy Dunne. But soon, their lives spiraled out of control. Because of their marriage deteriorating, and issues arising, Nick seems to be put in a difficult spot when his wife mysteriously disappears on a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, being their fifth wedding anniversary. Nick becoming a prime suspect in this investigation but denying he did it leads to dramatic suspense throughout the text. The truth about her disappearance is soon revealed by the narration of the story, which is split into two perspectives: Nick’s present experiences, along with Amy’s past fading into present ideas recorded in her journal. After a series of vents containing: lies, violence, pregnancies, and identity theft; will their dysfunctional marriage continue, or be forced to a halt?<br /> New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn uses extreme plot reveals the psychology and dynamics of a long-term relationship. Even though each relationship is different, this story gives an idea of the more dramatic end of the events that could take place in a marriage of people who are not right for each other. This story also displays the affects of media in present day. Nick is perceived as a totally different person, just because of how the media makes him out to be.<br /> I rate this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Although at times the plot was slow, and you could easily predict what was coming next, every other aspect I enjoyed. The suspense kept you reading, while the extremity of the character’s plans kept you shocked. The dramatic change from psychologically demented to peaceful and joyfully character’s motifs gave you a spinning characterization. I enjoyed this for the sole fact that it kept me wanting to read. The comfortable language used in the book made it fair to understand what was happening, which was also a plus. “There’s something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.”(Flynn). The level of adaptation of this quote to sections of the book really portrays how plot turning and complex this book really was. I would highly recommend this to anyone that was curious, and I would be interested in reading any other sequels and tuning in to see a movie of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is hilarious. both me and my daughter laugh and cut up each and every time we play. highly recommend it.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The story was action packed but also a bit needlessly gruesome at points. The plot was a bit far fetched too.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|First off, if you've read the book and are looking for a replica, skip this movie.  The movie takes place at the beginning of the war, and as such, is not anywhere near the book in story or format.  That being said, if you approach it knowing that it is a new story and not expecting much relation to the book, you won't be disappointed.  It's a great movie with the right amount of balance between storyline, action & suspense.  If you don't gore, you won't be bothered by this movie.  Very light on the gore factor compared to most Zombie movies and without the horrible human nature element that discourages some from watching apocalypse movies.  I highly recommend this movie as a separate entity from the book.<br /><br />However, do not use this movie as a substitute for reading the book.  Since they are not the same thing in any way, you will really be missing out if you do.
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|I had these recordings on 8 track back in the 70's. I also had everything by the Doobies on vinyl. For whatever reasons, I had not picked them up on CD format, but when this opportunity arose, I jumped at the chance. What a great trip down Memory Lane! I am pleased with the total package!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|GlobalSat BU-353.  Works with gpsd under Raspbian Linux.  I was not able to get the newer version BU-353 S4 to work with gpsd, and read of others having the same problem, so I returned it for this older model BU-353.  The newer BU-353 S4 does seem to work fine with Windows, though.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|These recordings were done at a time when America couldn't get enough of the Fab Four. I was in 8th grade when The Beatles played Ed Sullivan; my musical frontiers were forever changed, and this offering brings back all the freshness of those four young brilliant musicians... good stuff! The liner notes and packaging are an excellent compliment to these spontaneous live versions, some of which were not recorded in the studio.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I really love this game.  It is very addictive.  It was easy to learn once you went through the tutorial.  I've reached the point where not all moves can be based on logic so being a good guesser is useful. The pictures are very colorful and it just happens that I LOVE hot air balloons! The gameplay is very smooth and no permissions or ads to deal with.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought all the Beatles' CDs when they first came out in the late '80's. I recently had an opportunity to listen to &#34;Revolver&#34; in its remastered version, and found it was a worthy purchase to consider the box set. There is a shipper out of China who is selling a bootleg version; I had received this, but returned it and reordered the box set through Amazon. Everything from the packaging to the fidelity of the music is wonderful in the official version! I am extremely pleased, and actually listen to everything in this set on a regular basis. Yay!

0061353248|5.0|Both this and Ariely's other book, The Upside of Irrationality, are great reads.  As with all books, some chapters are better than others.  But Ariely has a way of explaining behavioral economics in a way that anyone can easily understand.  If you internalize his lessons regarding the tricks your brain plays on you (and that marketers exploit) it can benefit your life in a serious way.

Charming, witty, thrilling and smart.  Despite leaning a bit too heavily on coincidence in a couple of points, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Extra copies have already been purchased as gifts for friends.

0399157573|5.0|Wonderful read, Cornwell continues to dazzle us with her detailed crime scenes and vivid descriptions of places in, and around Cambridge MA. The first person point of view puts us in the mind of our heroine, Kay Scarpetta, as she takes us through the scene of several gruesome murders. Dust keeps you guessing right up until the end, wondering who you can trust, from the jogger in the park to the FBI. Scarpetta, along with her usual gang, let the dead do the talking in order to solve the crime. Another hit for Patricia Cornwell.

B008JFUS28|4.0|Thor: The Dark World is another well done film in a long line of excellent Marvel Universe movies. If you had to ask me my favorite Marvel character, Thor would be pretty far down the list, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Once again, the acting was solid all around. There is less of a character journey for Thor this go around as he has settled in to his humbler and more thoughtful warrior role, but we do see some new dimensions to the Loki character. We get to see a lot more of Asgard and Thor’s family this time around. There are lots of scenes where you can easily believe you are watching a Lord of the Rings style fantasy, but the underlying science fiction is still there, especially in the final act. The climactic battle includes some very creative use of space portals to make the fight different than anything I have ever seen before. I believe there are even more moments of humor than the first, and all are well placed and well delivered.<br /><br />One question I had going into the movie was how would they create a significant enough threat to match the power levels of Thor, but at the same time making it plausible that the other Avengers wouldn’t become involved. Given that we have this connected universe, it makes sense that if something major goes down on Earth all the Avengers would once again assemble. Thor: The Dark World gets around this pretty well by putting a very short clock on the action happening on Earth, so that it is easy to believe nobody else would have time to react, thus leaving Thor to handle this threat without any Avengers backup. I look forward to seeing more of this character, especially in the future Avengers movie.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Great movie, always liked Superman. Its nice to finally have a movie that dose the man of steel proud.<br />Henry Cavill dose a superb job, cant imagine anyone doing a better job with that role.

0140143505|4.0|When a Facebook acquaintance posted a recommendation of this book, claiming it to be an excellent and quick read, I had to give it a go. It contains 20 years’ worth (from 1949-1969) of letters of correspondence between spunky American author, Helen Hanff, and subdued British book seller, Frank Doel. When she learns of the store, she writes to ask that he track down a book, which leads to more (and more, and more) requests of titles that to modern day readers will probably range from very familiar to rather obscure. The neat thing is that she starts sending the book seller and his colleagues foodstuffs that are difficult to obtain in Britain at the time, as gifts, because of which, these persons begin corresponding with her as well. The part where she writes about wanting to visit reminded me of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, but reading on showed the differences (and, in fairness, this book is nonfiction and preceded TGLPPPS). The end surprised me because in my obliviousness, I had not realized that it was a true story and I didn’t think that an author would choose to end things in the way she did. And I’m sure she wished they hadn’t ended that way, but as they say, c’est la vie. In summary, 84 Charing Cross Road is a neat, entertaining read that contains an intriguing and eclectic list of prospective books for the reader. Also good: Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn, TGLPPPS by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This movie is one that is so ridiculous, it's awesome! It pokes fun at all the teeny-bopper, good-girl-falls-for-bad-boy movies but still has a good story. I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and we watch it all the time.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|An epic tale highly recommended; the more you read the more you are drawn in to the story and want to find out what happens next. The main protagonist is enigmatic yet strangely captivating and you naturally want to explore his tale.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was really a good movie, the loyalty even in war time between the young man and the horse was fantastic.
B00136JR2M|5.0|Classic album from the best era in hip hop. The 90's were great. Not many groups in the game now.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it's fun for the first few months but  it gets a little boring after the first few months but it is still my go to game when I m bored I have had it for 8 months their is stuff to by but you can still have tons of fun I have not spent a cent on this game and it is still awesome as hell definitally get this game
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Excellent 3D quality with a decent story. High level special effects, good action sequences. Definitely worth the purchase. Amazon was cheaper than Walmart
147676459X|5.0|Allie Brosh is truly gifted - someone who can convey a sad story with such humor that you are cry-laughing through every page, or turn simple childhood memories into hilarious, epic tales. I love Allie's blog and was so excited to see she had made a book. Fortunately, the book does NOT disappoint. I was leafing through it at work and had to stop because I was laughing so hard just from some of the drawings without having the context around them (the cake Cake CAKE! one got me so bad I had to snap the book shut).<br /><br />Please buy Allie's book and support her. She has a lot to offer the world, I can't wait to see what she does next.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|Jane Austen...The words speak for themselves but it was really fun to read her works front to back without stopping!!!!!
B0024FAG6M|2.0|So disappointed. A life-changing film when it came out - young impressionable - high school. Bought it for the music, but still the video quality for blu-ray was terrible. I understand you need a good master to make a good quality film, but in cases like this there should be a disclaimer &#34;grainy&#34;. That said. This is still a good movie for the most part. Historically significant. Most movies of the era depicted hippies in a holywood fantasy way. This was closer to the truth. Done by Hopper. His and Jack Nicholson are worth the price of admission. the ending was shocking in its day is pretty tame now.
0425263924|4.0|Not as good as 'Fifty Shades of Grey'.  Story line is too similar to Fifty Shades of Grey!  Still worth the read....
B005VSRFEA|5.0|For me this was a introduction to systems thinking.  I really like systems thinking.  It especially helped me with explaining software concepts that I deal with every day to other people.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I think it was  very helpful helping me learn and pronouncing the  English. It is easy because I can understand the text .I hope you enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game very easy to play and one you do your are hooked! I hope there are more levels like Christmas and such!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|More great work by a great band. Several favorite tracks but all are really good. I'm ready for the next CD.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Even if you didn't like the ending, this neatly wraps up an great story and leaves an opening for future stories.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I love Jesse Cook's music! This is a must have CD if you like Jesse Cook - get it. :-)
0679805273|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's a perfect gift for a graduating senior.  I love the book by Dr. Seuss:)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the best apps I have. Love how it syncs across all my devices. I rely on this app everyday. Can't be without it.
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|A lot like mystery manor.  You have quests to solve that use up energy.  Some of the items in the scenes are hard to see.  Over all not a bad game considering it is free.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|Story is ok. I'm still trying to understand the timeline. Did need to clear some storage before l was able to donwload on to my kf. Runs well no glitches so far.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It kept me thinking about the story during the daytime. I read at nite & had to make myself stop.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The app is great as a digital cleaner, without all the chemicals used with an actual mop & broom.  Wish it were available for Windows.
B00DB624GS|5.0|One of the GREAT guitar albums of all time. Peter Green and Danny Kirwan play so well together, it's hard sometimes to tell who's playing what. To be sure there is some pseudo-hippie stuff on here and some very strange moments... &#34;Searching for Madge&#34;  has a groove going, but a voice interrupts to say &#34; yes.... YES !! ... and has a classic music interlude too.... very strange !! There are several Danny Kirwan compositions worth noting... the dreamy &#34;Underway&#34; classically segues into the nasty &#34;One Sunny Day&#34; - TURN IT UP !<br />I believe Dicky Betts, former guitarist from the Allman Bros. Band was inspired by these instrumental Kirwan pieces. They have the same feel to them ( ABB's &#34;High Falls&#34; comes to mind immediately ). For me though, the masterpiece on here is Peter Green's &#34; Before the Beginning &#34;.  The lyrics, music and Peter Green's great singing is incomparable - what a piece of music - NOTHING like this is out today !!!
B004SIP7AS|3.0|This is not my favorite version of Emma. Gwyneth should have starred in the version with Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley. That would have been a great movie. She's a powerful actress and played the character well, she just didn't have the support of a good script or cast. It's just okay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hours of fun and very challenging. Friends talked me in to playing now I'm mad that I waited so long to start playing because they are all on higher levels. I'll catch up :)
B000I3UMKM|5.0|So wonderfully light and funny...feels like Sex in the City of the 50's. Tiffany's versus Milano Blanics. . . .
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Great 3D Blu-Ray set.<br />Nice eye candy for the price. Shortly before I took delivery of my new LG 3D TV from Amazon, I bought a bunch of these short themed DVDs. The IMAX productions are well presented and really pop.<br />Be careful not to double order. These discs are sold separately.
0064404994|5.0|Great book to read! I learned about C.S. Lewis and his works and the class taught me about his speeches and beliefs.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Great 3D Blu-Ray.<br />Nice eye candy for the price. Shortly before I took delivery of my new LG 3D TV from Amazon, I bought a bunch of these short themed DVDs. The IMAX productions are well presented and really pop.
0316055433|5.0|I love the evocative language and the pace, and the characters, who are so well described. And I love that it's so long, the story can plow on and on, which is completely engrossing!
B0089LOG02|5.0|-heartbreaking story of lost love and family.  Gives one the hope that life  is good, inspirational, and families really are forever.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|If you go into this knowing exactly what your doing, this movie is pretty silly fun. It is not going to change the world, but it has a lot of the same feeling as Men In Black, and that isn't a bad thing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really fun<br />Play it in my deer blind. Would recommend it to anyone. Awesome graphics. Hard to get to at first
B00FEN000S|5.0|Pacific Rim is AWESOME.<br /><br />This movie is a love letter to the great Anime. Evangelion, Macross, Appleseed. The human story behind the armor is a perfectly told tale of military sci-fi.
0385335482|5.0|I've loved this entire series. They're the perfect books for reading on a plane, the beach, the subway, when you're exhausted from work and just want to laugh and veg out a little. Yes, they're about shopping, but they're well written and I love how the author has thought about how shopping impacts EVERY aspect of Becky's life and how she explores so many different types of shopping. (Who knew there was quite so much shopping to be done?) The crazy letters she writes to everybody are a hoot (you never see her letters, just the hilarious replies from her banker, the airline, etc). Each book in the series is as good as the last. I wish I could go to London and hang out with Becks and Suze. I've read several of the author's other books, and the Shopaholic series is her best work.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although the ending to Allegiant was sad, it was also beautifully written and full of meaning. I won't say why it was sad, I've probably already given away too much.<br />Like Insurgent, this book picks up right where the last one left off. Also, it's narrated by Tris and Tobias, which is awesome, if you ask me.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I got this game for my Kindle Fire HD and my kids LOVE it.  It is more fun for me to watch them play than to actually play the game myself!
1594746036|3.0|Somethings peculiar about Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  What's peculiar is you want to like this book as you are reading it because it is peculiar.  Just like you like reading horror books you want the horror, or mysteries to solve the mystery.  What's missing is nothing really happens in this peculiar book the ending leaves you flat. I'm guessing there is a sequel or  another story in another loop.<br /><br />The book is like the author said.  He found unusual pictures and made a story to the pictures.... He tried to connect the pieces but it didn't work for me. I love old pictures  that is why I read this book. wish there were more old pictures, better story, better ending.  It was just ok for me.
0739315293|3.0|The content is good but I would prefer to have it read by an actor rather than the author (I purchased the CD set).
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I've been playing these games for a while and love how they wrap my brain around the axle. Some hints:<br /><br />1. Read the instructions and/or play the tutorial. The rules aren't what you think they are.<br /><br />2. The dots on the hex tell you about the surrounding hexes, not about that particular hex's color.<br /><br />3. Play with the &quot;hide picture&quot; option. It's easier to see the colors of the dots and the picture is revealed when you successfully complete the puzzle, all at once.<br /><br />Love these!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|This album is fantastic for the listener that likes the full range of Eddie Vedder's musical & lyrical talent.  Several incredible ballads and a few raw hardcore songs too.  Love EV!!  Love Pendulum, Sirens, Lightning Bolt.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|This is a game somewhat like Minesweeper; you use clues to determine the color of a given hexagon.  You will need to work through the help screen tutorial, accessed from the HELP button on the home screen of the game.  There are also in-game hints. If an actual game using a smaller grid could be played with pop-up instructions as a tutorial, I think it would help, but the tutorial is good.<br /><br />Instead of numbers there are color clues provided by little hexagons inside any given hexagon.  If all the color clues are the same color, that means all the hexagons that touch the one you're looking at, that haven't been assigned a color yet, are the same color.  So, you can touch all of the surrounding spaces and select the color for those to &#34;clear&#34; them from the clues.  Don't be confused by the fact that all the clues will be adjacent to each other, the actual hexes might not be adjacent ones.<br /><br />Once you do that, the clues available in all the remaining hexagons that touch those will change to reflect the selection you made.  (If there were six color clues, and you &#34;colored&#34; in three of the surrounding hexagons, you will only have three color clues remaining.)  So, the clues are constantly updating to reflect the uncleared hexagons.<br /><br />I found it worked well to start from the edges.  As the instructions explain, you start working with hexagons that have all the same color clues within them, and clear those surrounding hexes.  Then check again to see what has changed.<br /><br />There are easy, normal and challenging levels and that the puzzles get more difficult as you work through the levevls.<br /><br />I love these kinds of games (I'm good at Minesweeper) and this is a keeper for me.  It may be a bit of a challenge to get your mind around at first, but I worked back and forth between the tutorial and the game I was working until I understood how it worked.   You can reset the game to start over.  It will track the number of errors you make and the hints you use.  If you make an error, you'll know because a big question mark appears.<br /><br />Also, the picture behind makes it difficult to tell, at times, whether you've already &#34;cleared&#34; a hexagon; you can turn the picture off if you wish.  If you can see the picture at all through the hexagon, it's been cleared.<br /><br />Tested on a Fire HDX 7&#34;mber of errors you make and the hints you use.  If you make an error, you'll know because a big question mark appears.<br /><br />Also, the picture behind makes it difficult to tell, at times, whether you've already &#34;cleared&#34; a hexagon; you can turn the picture off if you wish.  If you can see the picture at all through the hexagon, it's been cleared.<br /><br />Tested on a Fire HDX 7&#34;
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you like dark humor you will love this!  Once you start watching you can't stop. Great writers, Great actors.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|where to begin.  This is the entire Saga(or Hextillogy) of the six movies to be watched in order(unless you hate the prequal in which case you wil buy only the Original Trilogy also available) Though I am not a fan of the first movie(to save confusion I refer to the \\"Episode 1\\" as the \\"first\\" movie and Episode IV as the \\"4th\\" movie in chronological order-if you don't,, use your intelligence) I kind of want to rate this 4 stars instead of 3 except for the insipid use of muppet-style CGI used in Return of the Jedi and the first movie \\"Phantom Menace\\" for other reasons other than the well used CGI.  Reason, because I did enjoy Empire Strikes Back which didn't come across as a cartoon as much as the 4th movie where Han steps over Jabba and Greedo shooting first and Han being some kind of virtuous \\"paragon\\" like Matt Dillon in  Gunsmoke or Return of the Jedi as a whole especially Jabba's fortress with the muppets WAY over done and it was tollerable in 1983 but the 1997 crap is too Disney/Henson!  The thing I hated about \\"Return of the Jedi\\" the most(which is a good movie without Lucas's insipid changes) is in 2004 Darth Vader's dreaded \\"NOOOOOOOOO!\\" was dubbed in by Lucas as a sign he hates people over 35 who are his original fans who he would have nothing without!  Even if it is a clearly hated aspect of Darth Vader in Episode III, he went and dubbed it in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" as a real slap in the face to the true Star Wars veteran fans.  Even though I still love Star Wars-mostly for Empire Strikes Back where Darth Vader comes across as totally ruthless and evil killing off his generals like they were flies, I think there is some insult in the way he modified his second trilogy(as in original) the first trilogy(prequal) is a mix of okay to terrible(mainly Episode I) Episode II isn't too bad if you can tollerate Anakin and Padme being too mechanical in there acting together and Obe Wan trying to be funny and not being so at all in the least sense of the word.  The true performers were that of Christopher Lee(Count Dooku) and Ian McDiarmid(Palpatine/Lord Sideous). My favorite character in all of Star Wars isn't a Jedi at all, it's Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and I will say, he is the best actor in the central character department though in the 4th-6th movies all of them are good, including Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher's Leia.  I can't really complain about the saga but I can't really give it a good thumbs up totally and I reluctantly lower it from 4-3 stars.performers were that of Christopher Lee(Count Dooku) and Ian McDiarmid(Palpatine/Lord Sideous).

B00DCX08MW|4.0|This is as close to real flight as it gets . The dynamics of this game are real time and flight is easy but landing now that's tough air speed and flight factor's all apply keep trying  you will finally Land . Try viewing your landing to see what you did wrong
B00902AKK4|4.0|I am really liking this game. I am not having any freezing or control lagging like a few reviews mentioned, but them I am using a different device than those mentioned.<br />The only reason I deducted a star is for Flurry Analytics. I do not see the point in this.<br />The game is challenging, but fun. Makes you have to think a few steps<br />ahead, which I like.<br />Got it free, but would happily pay for it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Absolutely love All these Hero movies.  I have watched this movie at least 10 times since I recevied this movie.
0399536108|3.0|This book started out strong, with a good premise of taking charge of your life and making changes, but tapered off and became rather dull towards the end. If the last few chapters were removed, I'd increase the rating.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Rather depressing stories than the previous season.  I do not like Bates' storyline, which really needs to be concluded soon.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a really great app.  Used it to optimize my Wi-Fi at home and to help install Wi-Fi at a friends house.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|This one is what some would call........ Legendary! Better songs then albums past, glad he gets back to his roots.
B000006YYW|5.0|Excellent 80s synth pop album. Great tunes, wonderful singing, and it's not just about 'Juliet'. Every song is worth listening to...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved the way the Narrator, who also is death, portrayed many things. The way you look at little things, or the way war and death go together in such a different way. I like that it wasn't just written from beginning to end. I enjoyed the flash backs and glimpses forward.<br /><br />I love the characters in this book. It was hard to not fall in love with Liesel or Rudy. Plus the layers in the characters like  Rosa, Hans and Max were so real. We all have layers and mixed emotions on controversial issues and you could see that in the characters. You could see how Rosa was seen by others, how she acted, but knowing her real good intentions and love for her family.<br /><br />The author did a good job showing a glimpse of the life of those who did question what was being taught in Germany. That life wasn't easy. I am looking forward to the movie, hopefully I will still love the characters in the movie as much as I did the book.
B00846REIS|5.0|It actually had a storyline...Well written..couldn't put it down...I've already read the 2nd book and am on the 3rd...highly recommend.
B001RP22G2|3.0|vinyl never got to my house. money was refunded very quickly. I was looking forward to listening. maybe next time.
1423113462|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I loved the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, so I expected to like this book. I loved it instead. In a feat of writing unseen by me before, the spinoff series is as good as the original. This book blends action, friendship, love, betrayal, and history set in modern times masterfully. Bravo, Rick Riordan. Bravo.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This is a total crap app, don't waste your time downloading it. seriously, it is a waste of your time.
1250038820|4.0|It contains some great pictures, but additional personal stories about the subjects of the photos would have made a better book.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Great movie even for adults. It's kind of like Godzilla and the Robot Godzilla except more plot, better acting, and superb special effects.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So convenient !  Use this app all the time! It is a favorite!  Go Amazon for creating this app!  Love it!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I never knew there was a difference when it came to car chargers. I had a Belkin and it took forever to charge my iPhone. This charger is great because of the dual ports and they are marked which port is meant for iPhones. My phone was charged with a 30 minute drive.
B00G6Q29KQ|4.0|The &#34;Trilogy&#34; is a thought provoking entertaining read. Concepts based from &#34;New Age or New Thinking&#34; Spirtitual<br />Beliefs and disciplines portray how the world can be in peace,with out hunger,war,fear and greed. With out giving a spoiler alert this Trilogy is a story about our times now and how life could be.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Very funny with an intelligent script, great animation, beautiful artwork, creative plot, endearing and well-developed characters.  Ideal family fun movie.  They have managed to create something new and fresh.  Delightful.
B00198X0VS|3.0|I just was looking at reviews here specifically for the blu-ray edition and saw that no one mentioned the hilarious short of the Chubb Chubbs is NOT included with the blu-ray. I guess studios couldn't care less about giving people even the minimum features that were on the DVD version, especially when people will fork over their bucks without even noticing themselves!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I like totally hate this game it is so stupid<br />Don't buy this book<br />It is retarded I can't stand it so freaking lame like who has that much time
B00FLNRN06|5.0|I don't normally watch a movie twice but this one I will. Very funny will have you laughing the whole time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I just started a week ago and I can not stop! I have been playing EVERY spare moment I've had. It's so addicting! I highly recommend this game! It's loads of fun!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love being able to play weather I am on facebook or not. I enjoy the challenge that each level gives
B003O86FMW|5.0|The storyline of the book was very captivating. I could not put it down. That goes with all of her books. I wanted the story to go on and on.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|Clear writing, intelligent, out of the box thinking, insightful. Makes you want to keep the book and reread it later.
B00GINENG0|5.0|He funny cute little cat I love this game it's is fun  Cool stuff that I love<br />More talking friends  when are  little make talking Ben<br />And pepper to
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Could not quit reading.  Wanted to know the outcome and I  could relate because I knew of a situation similar to this.
B001EBWING|5.0|Who doesn't love Casablanca?!  What a great classic.  If you have not seen this movie, you must rent it… better yet, BUY IT!  Love, betrayal, war, booze, friendship, duty...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. there is so much to it. I especially love all the levels. they are challenging. I recommend this to everyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This version is a vast improvement over earlier ones. Simple navigation and clear interface.  would highly recommend to avid pinners!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much but the only thing  that it needs is a few updates.I mean, I want it to be like the PC virsion.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This author never writes a bad book!  Some stories are better than others, but all are designed to make you think.  I wish they came out a little more often, but I know he puts a lot of time and research into each publication.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|In my opinion, this is the perfect zombie book. World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War focused on the virus that caused reanimation, how the virus was spread, and medical/military strategies to detect/control/fight the epidemic. The book is told in an interview style as the narrator interviews people from different professions and cultures about the &#34;Zombie War&#34;. Because of this style of storytelling, I didn't exactly feel connected with the story but in retrospect I am actually glad I didn't because it is such a dark subject and the way the Zombie War is described made it feel real and like it could actually happen. I listened to the audiobook which was so well done; each interview subject was told in a different voice which again made the material come alive and feel real.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />“Most people don't believe something can happen until it already has. That's not stupidity or weakness, that's just human nature.”
B00COMLLX2|5.0|All around really cool game. Sound and graphics are really great. Got it cause I have full version on PS3 & love it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Lee Child is my favorite author, and I have read many books by many authors. No writer and no literary work approach perfection, but this novel is one of Lee Child's most flawless examples of Jack Reacher at his best. Reacher has no respect for authority when authority is not limited by a clear understanding of right and wrong, and to a lesser extent, not limited by the bounds of common decency, basic fairness, and constitutional constraints. Reacher places himself under fewer restrictions. He is not an instigator, but anyone who is and starts trouble with Jack Reacher can expect Reacher to be the last man standing after Reacher sorts out what is right from what is wrong. Once that line has been crossed, the retribution will be dispensed in direct proportion to how far the perpetrator has veered from the straight and narrow in interfering with Reacher's lonely path in search of freedom and justice, as he inevitably inches toward advancing age. Reacher is a loner, a survivor, and a crusader for justice and the American Way. He is a lone ranger more than the Lone Ranger of my childhood every was. If you are evil, he becomes for you a sociopath with no remorse. He becomes your personal Dexter as you become Dexter's next serial-killer victim. The predator becomes the prey and justice will prevail.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|I enjoyed the book and was glad I purchased it.  It's not great but I didn't expect it to be.  Since finishing the book I have experienced many conversational moments- about social media, the NSA, privacy, big data, etc. where I find myself saying &#34;but then I just finished reading The Circle and...&#34; I found Mae a believable character, an needy introvert constantly seeking validation. Ty, on the other hand did not seem real. How could he develop a plan so dependent on Mae - unless he intended to fail. The final scene in Annie's hospital room was really chilling.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So, i watched the HBO series before I read the books.  Love both but the books (as always) rival the series (which didn't entirely stay true to the books' story-line).  Highly anticipating the release of the final book/s!!
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|this should be a 5 star in my opinion. Even though it sounds like a total 'guy' movie there were few blood and guts scenes. For it's balance of action and romance it gets 5 stars from me.

0385537131|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by any of John Grisham's books, and Sycamore Row is no exception. His background as a lawyer makes all of his legal thrillers absolutely realistic. This was absolutely one of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; books.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen the Broadway play several times and never get tired of it.  I love the movie even though it wasn't as good as the play.  But then they never are when they make a movie out of live show.  But it is still good.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A Christmas Classic.  Just seems to bring out the best in everyone that watches it at this time of year.  I have bought several copies of this movie over time and have given it as a gift.  Always appreciated and loved.  Never get tired of watching it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|So far so good. I was worried because some of the reviews said the discs come damaged. I checked them all. in Season 1 each disc looks used but so far plays fine. In one of the later seasons the disc looked discolored, I haven't played that yet to check. I think I'll get slips for them and store them a little better.<br /><br />The West Wing! ;-) And what a great sales price.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Just plain old fun. How to kill 10 minutes with your phone.....this is it right here. Challenging, but limited games
B00DWZHTOU|3.0|Interesting conceptually but had a hard time connecting with the magician character.  Did not cheer for them, rather found myself wanting them to get caught by Mark Ruffalo.  Especially Jesse Eisenberg, his character had zero likeability, possibly by design as he was playing the most egoist among slightly lesser egoists, but still... I also didn't want to root for Freeman's smug character leaving Ruffalo as the only person you wanted to see come out on top, but... won't go on for fear of spoilers.  All in all, being my personal opinion, found it interesting and entertaining but not a movie I would enjoy repeatedly.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Well let's start off by saying I really liked book 1 in this series, &#34;Divergent&#34;. I thought the 2nd book was okay but redundant. And I am not even sure where to start with why &#34;Allegiant&#34; was such a massive failure. So much potential with this series! The concept was unique and extremely intriguing. But the execution in this finale was abysmal. It wasn't WHAT happened it was HOW it all happened. This book basically screams, &#34;I am an amateur!&#34;. Mrs. Roth's inexperience definitely showed!!!
B009YQJ322|5.0|Regret no seeing this on the big screen.  While there are other movies to compare this to in terms of true originality, it is a near perfect way to bring Dredd to the big screen, as opposed to the mess the Stallone vehicle drove to Hollywood.  It captures the demeanor I always imagined in live action.  Yeah, there are some comic books aspects that people associate with the character but to put it on the screen some adjustments should be expected, even by the faithful.  I hope this gets a sequel, there is a deep history for this character to explore.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is so addicting and fun for all ages. I would recommend it for everyone if you are tired of word puzzles.Time sure goes fast with this game, two thumbs up!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Though the books started a little slow and seemed to drag on, I kept reading to find out how he survived. It was such a pleasure to read and learn more about this Lone Survivors story. I felt drawn in and pained for him as he worked his way to stay alive. How grateful I am for men like Marcus and the SEALs who are willing to risk their lives so I might enjoy mine.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|At the same time, very personal and very wide. Chimamanda made me go back to when I was an immigrant, an outsider, an external observer of a new world. I could see myself in Ifemelu and Obinze, but was also able to take a step back away from their story and just enjoy it. Thanks, Chimamanda, I remain a huge fan of your work, and your way of seeing the world.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I forgot all about this movie, and then saw it on amazon and had to get the tenth anniversary edition. It has the regular movie, directors cut which I think is better and explains more. And a lot of extras. Now to talk about the movie. I don't even know how to describe it. It's sort of dark moody with great acting by the whole cast with a very complex story. If you like very different movies with a very creepy and interesting back drop and story you will love this movie. A lot of interesting cast choices in this movie. I don't want to tell to much about just check it out, I don't think you will b disappointing!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|At first I didn't think I'd like it but once you got to know Victoria you couldn't help but be right there at every turn with her!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved this book so much.  The story grabs you from the start and between the mystery, the beautiful descriptions of the circus and the wonderful character development - it never lets go!  I alternate between hoping they make a movie out of this book and then hoping that they don't because nothing on screen could compete with the pictures the author paints in your mind.  Can't wait to read the next book from Ms. Morgenstern.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This not my normal genre of reading but after much prodding I finally gave in and all I can say is WOW!!!!!  What an awesome book!!  So action packed and not a dull moment.  On my way to go buy book two!

B00D0Z2JR4|5.0|I bought the movie with expectations that i would have the option of choosing the English format but that was not the case, so why in the world would ur pr person think that DBZ would only be popular in Japan when America is ur biggest fans along with the rest of the world
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Another great story. My only complaint is that I can't put the book down and end up finishing it too quickly.
1250038820|5.0|I felt like I needed to buy this book since HONY is the only blog online that I follow...and I love it! It's a great coffee table book. I will admit that I enjoy reading the posts on the online blog more...just because the photo captions are more in depth and show more personality. Most of the photos in this book were limited to only a short phrase, or just a location, but I still definitely think it's a great buy.
0525425772|1.0|I like books by John Grisham, I like Young Adult fiction, so this book should have been a no brainer.<br />The writing is so simplistic and heavy with dumbed-down explanations of legal and political processes it's practically condescending. The politics are so heavy the story comes off as preachy.<br /><br />But the worse part is Theodore Boone, a thirteen year old who understands eminent domain but has to have someone explain to him what property tax is and where the government gets money to fund the construction of a bypass. He's just so inconsistent and it's obvious Grisham elected to create a particularly mature 13 year old so he wouldn't have to think too hard about how a typical adolescent's mind works.<br /><br />As an adult reader, I was bored to tears, and if I read this as a thirteen year old I would have been insulted by all the basic definitions and instructions that were a thinly veiled attempt to educate an audience who would most likely understand what's happening if he had just let everything unfold in context.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|It's a well written account of her experience and understanding.  Anita does a great job of putting her experience into words and in a form that we can understand.  In her experience, as she say, it was all happening at once which is a difficult concept for us to understand.<br /><br />I am not much of a reader yet I found it had to put this book down.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I would recommend this to readers would loved rick riordan's series and lovers of short stories! I like the interviews and the crossword puzzles
B008JFUPK8|1.0|I loved the movie.  I loved the writing, characters and the action.  However, I still will not buy this product.  It does not have I-Tunes.  To me that is a very important feature.  As that it does not have it I will not buy this product.  I think itunes is far more superiror then uv.  And if I were to buy the b-ray and the itunes copy it would be more expensive.  WB should do what Universal does.  They allow you to access both at no charge that way everyone is happy.  Or at least do what Paramount does.  Give a choice.  WB I will not be buying your products until this is fixed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't have cable, and a very small laptop (Samsung Chromebook), so this is the perfect substitute<br /><br />This is great! It works perfectly and it is the easiest thing to setup. The app list isn't that great (yet) but the ones that they do have works great. I run a Samsung Chromebook, which doesn't Cast very well, but apparently Google is working on that. This is really awesome, it's everything I need.
B0015RFCZ0|2.0|Cool concept of the musical prodigy, some great concepts for the scenes with music, but poorly executed - in that it's VERY obvious the actors did not play the instruments. Storyline achingly predictable, characters very one sided, flashbacks confusing. A highly contrived story that's not very well told either.<br /><br />GREAT music though!
B00881VLCE|4.0|awesome app my little nephew spends hours on this while we drive. He loves to do the puzzles its fun and great for his mind
B009KS4XRO|4.0|So far I like this app the best. It's only flaw is the occasional freezing. I wish it had different ways to bingo than the standard 13

B00E6G23TA|3.0|Chailly's previous Brahms cycle revealed that the conductor did not have a real affinity for this music.  Despite predictably gorgeous playing from the Concertgebouw, the cycle did not offer any revelations.  This new cycle finds Chailly with his new band, armed with allegedly new interpretations, ready to revolutionize Brahms in new and exciting ways.  Unfortunately, the result is equally ineffective as Chailly remains unmoved and disinterested.  Ironically, however, the cycles represent two diametrically opposed \\"schools\\" of thought: Chailly Concertgebouw cycle is very much of the heavy \\"German\\" school, while this new cycle is Chailly's \\"HIP\\" update, with quick tempos, extremes of dynamics, and forcefully driven.  Odder still is that the strength of one cycle is the other cycle's weakness.<br /><br />The good news to report is that the weak link in the previous cycle - the third - is this cycle's strength.  Chailly's Concertgebouw third was disastrously heavy and brutally ponderous.  After the opening wind chords, the velvety Concertgebouw strings, accompanied by thunderous timpani rolls, clogged the score of this particularly tricky work.  To that end, Chailly's current \\"faster,\\" \\"leaner\\" approach does wonders in the outer movements.  The opening allegro moves along at a nice clip, with colorful commentary from the winds and horns, but slows for a particularly atmospheric central interlude.  The finale is similarly fine, with menacing lower brass in the big crescendo leading up to the developmental/recapitulatory climax.  Still, Chailly's mechanical drive toward the finish line does not generate as much excitement as he imagines.  The first movement coda could have been better shaped, the slow movement's pacing is slightly off, and Chailly does not succeed at sustaining tension in the finale's developmental section.  As fine as it is, it does not displace those great thirds from artists as diverse as Szell, Wand, Levine, and Dohnanyi.<br /><br />The bad news is the great strength of the Concertgebouw cycle - the second - is this cycle's nadir.  At just under 18 minutes, with expositional repeat, this is one of the fastest first movements on disc.  And while Chailly's basic tempo might not raise eye brows per se, it is what he does (or does not do) with that tempo that is so frustrating.  Chailly's forceful drive works all sorts of mischief.  For example, the perfumed second theme is not given sufficient room to bloom, while the subsequent wind syncopations sound mechanistic.  Worst of all, the terraced brass chorals in the development are not given time to sufficiently build themselves towards the great climax they are capable of achieving.  Chailly's refusal to shape phrases, much less use any rubatto, results in a stale, insufficiently contrasted first movement, which is all the more frustrating when compared to his glowingly beautiful (and more appropriately paced) Concertgebouw performance.<br /><br />The first and fourth symphonies are on-par with their predecessors - well played but oddly unmoving.  Chailly's ability to \\"float\\" the violins in the slow introduction and in the subsequent development of the first's allegro is impressive but his inability to ensure inner part writing, especially from the winds, is always audible proves frustrating.  More rhetoric would have served the long crescendo towards the developmental/recapitulatory climax, as well as the coda as a whole, far better than Chailly's hard-hitting approach.  The beautiful organ-like wind chords in the finale's slow introduction cannot add gravitas where Chailly allows none, leading into an alpine horn episode which is frustratingly earthbound.  Chailly's rushed (and sloppily executed) developmental climax is particularly irritating after the preceding excitement while the mad-dash coda is almost comical in its false hysteria and manufactured enthusiasm.<br /><br />Chailly's fourth is commendable for the fine playing from the Gewandhaus strings and winds in the andante, flowingly paced and beautifully sung.  The scherzo is equally well-played, especially at Chailly's quick clip, but it could have handled more biting commentary from the brass, trumpets especially.  The first movement is run-of-the-mill, save for some unnecessary dynamic modifications and orchestral gesticulations, while Brahms's tricky part-writing trips Chailly up in the finale.  The coda, nevertheless, is its always impressive self.<br /><br />The \\"fillers\\" are a mixed bag.  Chailly is the least successful in the standard works.  For example, why the vulgar tempo shifts in the Academic Festival Overture?  What come up best are the lighter dances - the nine waltzes and the three Hungarian dances.  Chailly is often at his best in lighter music, where a light touch and a pinch of energy here and there is all the music really needs.  It was true of his Shostakovich and the same is true here.<br /><br />Finally, there is the matter of the Gewandhaus.  While the orchestra plays beautifully, it is not the world-class ensemble Decca would have you believe.  It is on orchestra that is rebuilding (albeit masterfully) under Chailly.  Thus, any notion that these interpretations come with the authority of authenticity because the Gewandhaus is one of the oldest orchestra's in the world must be dismissed.<br /><br />Altogether, while unfortunate, it is not necessarily surprising that this release is unsuccessful.  Chailly had not proven himself a known quantity in this music in his prior life.  His radical rethinking showcased in this set mostly consists of speeding things up and exaggerating dynamics.  What is lost is any sense of architecture or form.  There are many impressive moments and interesting things Chailly finds to say, yet the final product is the definition of a curate's egg.  Turn to the sets by the aforementioned conductors for real Brahms.s in the andante, flowingly paced and beautifully sung.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I bought Neon Bible several years ago and thought it interesting, but wasn't sure what I felt was true love.  Then, I began to see them on Austin City Limits and other shows .....  I was hooked.  I like my musicians to be intense about their music AND their performances. These folks definitely are intense, not to mention flat-out fun to watch.  Hoping I get to see them live someday.

B000P0J09M|1.0|I will state, as many others that left poor reviews, by saying that I absolutely love this film.<br /><br />It is a piece of modern art, in my opinion.  Great acting, dialogue, cinematography, this movie has the works.  But the DVD itself is so glaringly bad, so godawful, that I must rate this item 1 star.  I consider this movie the best &#34;mob/gangster film&#34; of all time, but even such a title is forever tarnished by this DVD. I'll go through this step by step.<br /><br />First off, the DVD itself.  When they say &#34;dual-layered,&#34; they really meant &#34;dual-sided.&#34;  I'm a DVD aficionado, and I hate dual sided discs with a burning passion.  They're much harder to take care of, they're harder to take out of the case and they're harder to put back in without scratching the surface.  And this is just me, but I like to have a picture on my DVD, I don't want to have to read the minuscule print around the center ring to find out what I'm holding, and I hate having to try and figure out which side of the DVD I'm about to play.  I'd understand if this were done as a cost saver because there is so much material that it couldn't all fit on a one-sided DVD, but as a further indignation, the two sides simply contain the film is in two halves!  There are hardly any bonus-features to speak of, save for a few short biographies and film credits of the actors and the director.  No behind the scenes, no cast interviews, nothing at all.  Just the movie, and some screens with about 3 paragraphs of information about a few of the actors and Scorsese.  Just a double-sided DVD of a film in two parts, so that after you've watched half of the film, you have walk over to your DVD player and flip the disc over.  This aspect of the item is most definitely an abysmal 0/5.<br /><br />Secondly, the menu.  Nothing fancy, it's an older movie so I didn't expect much, but it's awfully bland, an injustice to the least bland movie ever.  I give the sound 2/5<br /><br />The sound is okay,but for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, it doesn't sound that well.  As a matter of fact, it seems that when I watch this movie on Cable the sound is better.  The issue could be my DVD player.<br /><br />The image hasn't been updated to HD, which isn't an issue for me.  This is Goodfellas!  It wasn't meant for HD!  It would have been nice, though.  I watched the film for the first time ever with the subtitles on, which is something I do with all of my DVDs.  Sometimes there are lines of dialogue that the actor(s) don't clearly speak or deliver, so I turn on the subtitles because I want to know exactly what they're saying.  I feel sorry for someone that is hearing impaired and tries to watch this DVD, because the subtitles are wrong in numerous parts!  It's as if whoever wrote the captions was only passively listening and paraphrasing what the actors were actually saying. 2/5<br /><br />Overall, I was sorely disappointed by this DVD.  I wasn't expecting Avatar or some other high-tech HD film, I know that this film is over 20 years old and was made in a time before DVDs.  But the flaws are so glaring, so frustrating, that I would never recommend this DVD to somebody else.  It's a bastardization of a movie that I fell in love with upon watching the first time.  It would be as if the woman you loved, who was as if you were with the most beautiful woman in the world (in your eyes), but then you were suddenly thrown into the future where she's extremely old, decrepit, with cataracts, gray hair, and cancer.  It's heart-breaking and an abomination, leaving you yearning for the past.
1609611543|5.0|Very informative.  I had no idea that wheat has undergone so much change over the years.  It's kind of frightening.  What are we eating, anyway?  And, it's not just the gluten content that we should be worried about.  As a result of reading this book, I've cut way back on bread consumption, as well as other wheat containing products.

Adam Brown's struggle with drugs and alcohol were a great example of how a relationship with Jesus can change a life. Even today.

The music is exquisite, with some traditional ballads like Tam Lin and Matty Groves.  It's very hard to find those particular songs on other cd's.  But the rest of the cd is wonderful too.

B009H7SCMA|4.0|At first I was a bit shocked as this isn’t usually the type of book I would read but Gabriella is an interesting character. Her self -loving, explicit and saucy ways lead the reader through wild, humorous and seductive events, which take place on the cricket field.  You get to know Gabriella very quickly but when she meets Jim you find out that he is not like the others.  She has met her match! Overall this is a well written and quite entertaining read but I feel it’s for those that enjoy reading a mixture of comedy and sport, surrounded by regular sexual events.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|What is there to say about Lady Gaga's 4th album 'Artpop'???<br />In one word, it's simple AWESOME.<br /><br />For any Lady Gaga fan, this is another must buy. The Mother Monster has once again delivered.<br />The album is very fresh, fast, not as dark as the last one. This shows how flexible she is with her music.<br /><br />Caveat: This album does take some time to get used to. At first play, you may be like &#34;huh??&#34;, but trust me, keep playing it a couple more times, and you'll find the tunes moving into your soul; and in no time you will be blasting the songs out loud, at your office, home, or anywhere, with no care who watches.<br /><br />If I had to put them in order, I would put Artpop in 4th place. But this by no means infers that Arpop is bad. On the contrary, Lady Gaga's repertoir is soooo good that it's very hard to beat The Fame Monster. So it's expected Artpop to &#34;not be as good&#34;, but it is still &#34;very very good&#34;.<br /><br />I would place her albums in order of preference as:<br />1) The Fame Monster<br />2) The Fame<br />3) Born This Way<br />4) Artpop<br /><br />But ALL are a must buy.<br /><br />Now, going into Artpop, most songs have similar beats and template, so don't expect a lot of variety, but rather one continuous &#34;rave&#34; playing in your ears.<br /><br />The songs that I enjoyed the most, and can't stop pressing reply are &#34;Venus&#34;, &#34;Se*** Dreams&#34;, &#34; Do What U Want&#34;, &#34;Donatella&#34;, &#34;Mary Jane Holland&#34;, &#34;Gypsy&#34;, and &#34;Applause&#34;.<br />These are the ones I recommend as &#34;BUY&#34;. (Buy the album as a whole for best value). They are so fun to listen.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are songs that I can find myself enjoying them when they come up on my playlist, but I may not necessarily go and request playing them at the moment.<br /><br />So go ahead and purchase Artpop. Any &#34;Monster Fan&#34; of hers will enjoy this for years to come.

The Baratheon brothers both feel they should be the one to inherit the throne. The Lannisters fight to hold the realm together.<br /><br />Martin has woven a very intricate tale of a world where the magic is awakening. Strange things are happening and winter is coming.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works.  Very simple to set up and use.  Works as expected.  Can use any place that has wifi and that you don't have to login to the network through a browser window. ie not hotels. Have an hdmi for that purpose
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a really good book! It is really sad too. I feel bad for August because he looks so different from everybody else.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This book is so packed with events that were so pivotal in our nation and the world. What a year to have been alive. Those who experienced 1927 certainly lived in interesting times.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of the best series on TV -- it rivals 'Upstairs, Downstairs' . For those of us who are Anglophiles it really fills the bill. It's the kind of series that you'll want to watch more than once.
B00CWVM1AC|1.0|For most of the movie Yossi is still down in the dumps over the death of his lover ten years ago.  I could not believe that he would go to his lover's parents and tell them their dead son was gay.  I could not believe that a young soldier would be attracted to this out of shape, brooding man.  I could not believe that after a few (?) days the two of them would chuck their old lives and live together.
0205313426|5.0|Excellent resource for writers with easy and quick access to information. All previous reviews are truthful, this little book is a gem.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|I watched it when it was on TV and really liked it.  I was excited to get the DVD.  I was disappointed that it only had 10 episodes.  I wanted more, more, more.......Can hardly wait for the next season.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Abercrombie has worked into my top 3 of favorites (which are all ties).  I think he is way better than George RR Martin and much more supportive of the reader.  He also rocks with his female characters - something I have found male authors don't always nail right.  Maybe his wife/daughters have trained him.  Anyway, his female characters keep me coming back, but his male characters are dynamite in a hard, mythic kind of way.  Abercrombie doesn't shy from violence, sex, or profanity - so, don't expect a PG-13 reading.  If you start reading Abercrombie, start with his first trilogy, then his others are standalones - BUT, you will find so many ties within the standalones that you will make clear exciting connections.  I hope Abercrombie doesn't a pull a GRRM on us and make us wait forever (if ever - I gave up on GRRM at book 5 - boooo) to find out how Glokta, Logan, Shivers, Murcatto, Shy, etc. all end up.<br /><br />You will both love and hate at the same time some of Abercrombie's characters.  It'll mess with your head in a good way.  Oh, and another thing I like about Abercrombie is he leaves some sort of ending (instead of HANGING like others I won't mention anymore) in place - enough to satisfy you, but enough dangle to bring you back.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I had read reviews of this movie.  It sounded good.  I was not sure if the fast moving zombies would detract from the movie when normal zombies are very slow.  I was happy to see that the entire movie was good and was definitely different from the 'normal' movie.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|One of my favorites.  Of course, part of the reason is because I connected with the subject.  But, Cain is a thoughtful writer and makes you think - so another great reason to buy!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I had seen the series years ago, but think I lost interest before the last couple of seasons.  I was glad to see the sixth season to see how the series ended.  I actually watched all the seasons and liked it better this time around.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|I couldn't finish it.  I get it already that Goliath had disadvantages against David, and some of his real life examples are boring.  What he writes could be said in a lengthy article, not a book - he drags it out.<br /><br />With that said, I have always been a fan of Gladwell's writing and will continue supporting him.  This book wasn't a total loss, but just too much filler for me.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|My girlfriend loves this game but I cant stand it so day by day night by night I have to hear &quot;damn it 2 moves left &quot; So I left her and deleted this game. GO COLTS
B00AHXIC50|5.0|The whole CD is great.  Every song is worth listening to.  His voice has that crystal quality but remains very sexy.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Really great. If you plan on downloadin this game, go for it. This game is really cool, and once you know how to do everything, it's really fun.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very dependable! gets me to work on time every day.  I don't think I will ever need to buy an alarm clock again.
1476727651|5.0|King comes through with another great story, it was a fantastic continuation of the Dan Torrance story.  There was a much different feeling from &#34;The Shining&#34; But it should be I know i don't feel or come accross the same as when i was a little kid neither should Dan Torrance.  Really enjoyed every second and I am excited for whatever King is cooking up next.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|The seal for the battery is not adequate for what is was designed for...WATER!!  Had to replace two batteries before the trainer completely died!  Complete waste of money.  If you are a swimmer, look at other equipment and don't consider this one.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|HATED this movie.  Poor story line, totally predictable and bad bad acting.  Sorry that I purchased it...of course the streaming itself was flawless!<br /><br />I thought it would be a mindless comedy--sometimes I'm in the mood for one of those.  Nope, this wasn't funny and was more annoying than anything!
0812992784|4.0|Rushdie explains the fears, challenges and sometimes humorous side of his 10 years in protective custody.  A must read for those who appreciate Rushdie's literary gifts as the book provides a rare glimpse at his tumultuous life.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Liked the Facebook version.  I am really excited to play it on my kindle fire.  Wonderful graphics.  Same characters as the original.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I can't believe it is over this book was amazing and the emotions that were written in this and the plot was stock to it was just amazing I can't believe it is over I an so going to miss it
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This highly suspenseful film is full of ghosts, magic, and murder. It is great entertainment as you the viewer try to figure out whether the film is about magic and illusion or revenge and murder.<br /><br />The story takes place in the last 1800s in Vienna during the reign of the Hapsburgs. In fact, Crown Prince Rudolf is a primary player in the story. Rufus Sewell, who has played every European king in one film or another, does a super job of play Rudolf. But the primary story is about a young village boy who becomes fascinated with magic and a young aristocratic girl. Ed Norton plays the adult magician, Eisenheim, now grown up and returning to seek the girl he has never forgotten. His magical skills have increased exponentially and they are the tool by which he makes his living, and by which he courts his long lost love, and by which the film’s mysteries are finally resolved.<br /><br />This is great entertainment. The city of Prague was used for Vienna. Paul Giamatti is great as the chief of police who sorts out the mystery simultaneously to the viewers of the film. If you watch it with a group, have an agreement that whoever figures out the puzzle or plot first should not tell the others until everyone catches on to this cleverly produced mystery film.
B002PL5GTC|5.0|Just as written and arrived very early, which was great because I ordered late and it was a birthday present. Ended up getting there in time for the birthday!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is a hard book for a middle-aged Mom of teenagers to read.  I was interested, even compelled, to read Thirteen Reasons Why after reading an essay by a teenage girl about the personal impact of this story and how much she identified with Hannah Baker and her thirteen reasons why she committed suicide.  (That is not a spoiler.)  Chilling.<br /><br />From my adult perspective, it's easy to say, \\"Come on, Hannah, be stronger!  You can't let stupid kids affect you like that, high school is not the rest of your life.  It gets so much better.\\"  I am reminded, however, that in some ways, high school was the trial by fire, a very difficult time of Life, before most of us, eventually, find our own inner strength and sense of self.<br /><br />I am interested to see what my own teenage daughter will think of Thirteen Reasons Why.  I hope it resonates with teenagers to hold on, get help, find your strength and don't let idiots manipulate you or control your destiny.
0399161287|4.0|While I've never been a huge fan or follower of Mike Tyson, for some reason I was drawn to this book, figuring if nothing else it would be good for a laugh or two. I fully expected to start reading and have my head filled with tons of internal groans, but on the contrary, the more I read the more I found myself actually enjoying the book.<br /><br />It's no secret that Tyson has lead a troubled, somewhat controversial life, but I really didn't know just how troubled his life was until I read this book. What a hard row to hoe going from one of the top respected and feared fighters of all time to becoming the butt of late night TV jokes. In our society it's so easy for us to begin to think of public figures as characters of a sort rather than real people with real thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />This book made me really open my eyes to the type of things that can go on behind closed doors, regardless of how much prestige and glamour one may portray. I enjoyed his ability to reflect upon his life honestly, humbly and somewhat candidly at the same time. It really gave me a new perspective on the man as a human being, and not just as an over the top celebrity.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I haven't read Grisham for years, but because I so loved his earlier works, especially A Time to Kill, I gave this a shot.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Jake Brigance is back and so is Grisham.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|Nice HD graphics and works well with the Kindle Fire HD. It's a fun game to play, and I enjoy the spooky themes. I imagine that it could get a bit repetitive, but it's fun none the less. Glad I added it!
0061900656|5.0|Perfect for a child with a new sibling on the way,,,,delightful. Easy read and a good lesson for a small child
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I downloaded this game on a whim without reading any reviews or checking to see what the game was about, and I'm fairly glad that I did. Basically the game is exactly the same premise as &#34;Stupid Zombies&#34; but tennis themed. Luckily for me, I don't mind the similarities at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed playing the game, and it works well on the Kindle Fire HD. The graphics are decent, and it's an excellent way to pass the time. The beginning levels are super easy, but rest assured that the game does get more challenging as it goes along.<br /><br />Thumbs up from me!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an excellent brain game. It is useful to help with problem solving and good for visual perceptual skills.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like the app. Once you figure everything out, it's easy to use and keep organized. I like the fact that it backs my notes up, too. I can log in from any device and have exactly what I need.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|In the realm of &#34;found footage&#34; horror flicks, consider 'Cloverfield' a success, along with such gems as 'The Blair Witch Project' and the first 3 'Paranormal Activity' films. 'Cloverfield' starts out innocuous enough, as we follow a group of 20-something friends as they party in Manhattan. Thankfully (because of the bland characters and moribund acting) it doesn't take long for things to, well, blow up. What appears to be a terrorist attack (with intentional echoes of 9/11) soon reveals itself to be much more unusual...<br />  Since the producers were so intent on keeping the movie's true villian(s) a secret, I won't let the cat out of the bag, even though the film is nearly 6 years old now. I'll admit, my rating is probably 1 star higher than is merited. But I'm a sucker for a good mons...oops. I've said too much. Check it out.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have a terrible time with anxiety, especially at night, i cannot turn off my brain!  This app works every time!  Finally, sweet sleep!
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|Nothing Special here. 3 Stars only for the size, and lack of REAL Usefulness. I have others that are &#34;prettier&#34; and &#34;more useful&#34;.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Entertaining and intriguing with fun character development.  Julianna Margulies is smart, beautiful, strong and charming in her role despite the challenges of reentering the workforce and caring for her family and supporting her husband despite transgressions and legal issues.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Amazing movie, love all the actor/actresses in it.  It has action and love, a great combo in my book, definitely waited too long to see it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the way it lets me keep in touch and watch the lives of people I care about.  It has great support groups for almost anything you can think of.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A great game to have fun and create. Fun it can get hard and frustrating. You yes I am talking to only you. You better get it.
0767919408|5.0|Have always enjoyed Bryson books. His style is relaxed and easy to read.  This subject matter is enlightening - a time when a lot of things happened but a lot of them weren't very nice (to put it delicately).
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This lady.. What a class act. I love this whole CD, even if it's a bit over-produced.  It is Whitney laying herself out raw with all of her lyrical expression as beautiful as it ever was.  Whitney makes us FEEL.  That is why she was so special.  There is so many messages of love and strength and courage... and FAITH.  Whitney had a ton of faith and it was never more apparent when she sang. Buy this CD and let Whitney sing good-bye to you in only the way she knew how.  If it's listened to with an open mind and with love and compassion, there is no way you won't enjoy it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game..just wish there was a better way to get money and things.. lots of fun though.. enjoy the graphics
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|The children love it and the graphics are sharp. I play it myself even though I am not fond of video games
B0006J28L4|5.0|when i first saw this movie i could not keep my eyes off the screen the film without any doubts in my mind a film worth the price i payed to see it then and now
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is perfect for math from just the simple stuff to algebra 2. Sure, you have to work around symbols sometimes, but its reliable. I recomend using it landscape, otherwise your fingers can push like three buttons at the same time
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!! I could not put it down and finished it in only two days and had me in tears at the end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book about love, human perseverance ,and man's cruelty . The special relationship between Liesel and those she came to know was so well developed they felt real. I lived each day with them. How man can get so caught up in the feeling of being powerful that they can forget this is another being just like themselves(the beating of Hans and Liesel). Of course I realize they were brainwashed by Hitler and just following orders. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, both for me as well as my younger family members, I originally downloaded it for them but now I'm hooked. Great job
B00EOFIYZA|5.0|Wondrous music. I'm glad my friend told me about her.i hope to hear more from her in the future. Lovely
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My favorite app. This app has limitless combinations and has a timer and you can save your favorite combinations. A must have
8820345463|5.0|best quick reference for latin palaeography and textual criticism graduate classes. I originally took a palaeography class WITHOUT an abbreviations book and it was VERY hard. This should make things simpler.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The graphics are so cool. I like the levels, I love the upgrades, voice actor, and missions. But what I most love is the game's fighting system.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This is going to one of my favorite albums (and I have alot of music!!!!)  Not only are the singers great but they selected alot of great songs.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Fun to play, but can be very confusing. Interesting concept and interesting game physics. Still trying to work my way around the interface.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|No my favorite of the Celtic Woman, but I do love the Celtic Woman.  Why is not women instead of woman??????  who cares along as they keep singing with those angelic voices.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Get tired of the ads that pop up almost every time you open the game. Other than that it's a great game
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift to my business partner  - I had seen it and knew he would love it and he does  - can't stop watching it. It arrived on time in perfect condition and I'm very pleased. Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG OMG OMG! I can't believe I would ever like a book so much!<br />I read this book in three days! So awesome it's a must read!
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|Catchy melodic songs, heavy drums and guitars, and polished production make this sound huge. Can't stop playing it, which is rare these days. Very well done record.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|This game is just okay.  I found it didn't flow as easy as most games do and I couldn't move on.  I took it off my Kindle to try in the future.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Very cool movie. The graphics are really great. The acting is pretty good too. We're a fan of all 3 main actors. Thanks!
B00CGNYDIE|1.0|Didn't think it was very good.  I didn't have fun playing and thought it was somewhat confusing how to determine the color to pick.  Not Very Logical to me.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Love the story line .Had a enought seek and fine .There needs to be a part two.<br />I would buy it.
B0034G4P1W|2.0|I doubt that this is one that will capture the kids' attention.  There are lots of better animated movies out there.  This one ends up just appearing silly and uninspiring for kids or grown-ups.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Yeehaw! I am from Texas and lemme just tell you I LOVE blowing the hell out of errrrrrthin' that moves.
B005LAII0I|2.0|This so very definitely is not nearly as good as SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN.  In fact, it's not as good as several recent fairy-tale takeoffs.  I did expect better.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Sandra and Keanu have something inside them that came out in this movie. Something very pure and true, a deep longing to be truely loved.<br />This movie became very personal to me. I can watch it many times and never tire of it. There is something about the hopes we all have inside us to find someone who will deeply love us as we do the same. Sometimes even if the only thing two people have in common is the desire to deeply and faithfully love each other, it's more than enough to make their life together a happy one. I love the hope this movie gives me. Even if that hope is a personal relationship with God, waiting for the time we will be together and believing it will come someday.
B00AFEY354|2.0|I'm sorry, but this just plain wasn't a good film, not in my opinion.  It was overly done and an overt attempt to be an important movie.  I'm sorry,,but as far as I'm concerned, it failed.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really like it but it did cheat me on the misuse fight cause I payed 9 real gold to balance the stats and I beat him and u tried to share it on facebook with a friend and I said foreclose so I did and it took all 9 real gold but it didn't count me beating midus
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I had some crazy idea that the old women in my apartment complex movie group would like this.  I sure goofed.  I was very thankful when the last viewer left after sticking this out for 30 minutes, and gratefully shut it off leaving the DVD on the freebie table for anyone who wanted it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It's really good, not as good as the first to. But still kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0087IT8FK|3.0|There's a lot to enjoy in this film, but it was slow and not always easy to follow.  The acting was truly superb.  I recfommend it, but of course, this isn't for everyone.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Good pix. Choices of size etc  I would comment more often if I did not have to give so many words
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|I truly loved this animated film from Tim Burton.  Anyone who loves the old Universal monsters will get a huge kick.  Of the current crop of animated horror/comedies, this is the one I recommend the highest.  It's often hilarious and it's a great homage to the monsters I loved during the 1940's.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|If you like Science Fiction then you should like Tuf Voyaging.<br /><br />It hypothesizes about how characters would react to situations that we don't yet face, both  socially and morally,  using science, space,  and technology as a backdrop.  It poses some deep questions about free will, beneficence, corruption, and morality.  However, it's also just a good old fashioned Sci Fi romp.<br /><br />If this is the kind of science fiction that you enjoy then you should like Tuf Voyaging.<br /><br />It is one of my all time favorite books.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is much more than a documentary.  It's a wonderfully filmed affirmation of life.  Its Oscar victory is overwhelmingly justified.  Documentaries don't usually interest the movie group at my apartment complex, but this one was universally liked by mainly 65+ year old ladies.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is the first book by these authors that I have read, and I enjoyed it immensely.  It moved quickly and kept my interest as several story lines developed.  I will definitely read more of the Preston Child books.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This is an amazingly tender movie.  The description might scare away those who would enjoy it.  Yes, there's sex and nudity in this, but it's done in such a way that it's truly a tender and loving film.  I showed it for one of my apartment complex's movie nights, and the senior ladies were not at all offended by it.  Highly recommended.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is a good family movie.  You can laugh and enjoy. What a family has to endure to stay together during a difficult period in time
B005LAII8A|3.0|I've followed Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Leavitt since BRICK, but this is my first disappointment with either.  It's worth watching, but it's not the best.
B00006674X|5.0|Elvis at his best. I can see Elvis being Dr. Carpenter.  A caring man in a position to help others and enjoy the music too.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|All in all, this was one of my favorite two movies last year.  The adaptation was 100% and I did really find it exceptional.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's been a long time since a book has kept pulling me back to read it which is what Ready Player One did. It was an entertaining and engaging novel, and I only had two very minor issues with it. The characters are well realized, sympathetic, and wholly entertaining. This book has jumped into my top five novels.<br /><br />My only two criticisms (and they are very minor) are that there is one chapter that feels completely unnecessary. Thankfully the chapter is brief and takes about 10-min. to get through. It's not a badly written chapter, it just doesn't seem to move the story forward at all.<br /><br />My second criticism is that the first half throws 80's references at you where it becomes a little annoying. We get it: Wade knows his 80's trivia. Let's move on.<br /><br />By the end though the good of this novel definitely outweigh my minor grievances. The book is an outstanding debut novel, and I can't wait to see what Cline does next.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a great animated film.  Some reviewer qualifies for girls, and if that's the case, the women, over 65, in my movie group are &#34;girls&#34;.  Really, I don't see why guys wouldn't like it too.  Highly recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Compared to the first two book it just wasn't as capturing. I felt like I was forced to finish it. It was basically sex scene after sex scene, lacked story line.
B007TR1R22|2.0|Good acting, but unlikeable characters and annoying music overshadow that.  I did enjoy the pub scenes with the singing going on, but basically can't recommend this.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst ending ever.......The hero/heroine should never die in a post apocalyptic dystopian society. After the world has gone thru any type of war, even Purity Wars, the writer should strive to end things positive. There were so many options for better endings with the all the serums. What were you thinking, Veronica Roth? Leave the tragedies to William Shakespeare.
B007UW9WOQ|3.0|I'm sorry, but the idea of raw fish never has appealed to me.  I did think that maybe I'd find something here to awaken my interest in Sushi, and it was a nice thoughtful film.  But it is more for foodies.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Not a bad game. The aim is a little floaty or wandering. Otherwise I like the look of the graphics. Using two hands is a tad difficult though.
B008220C38|4.0|I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews here.  I thought it a beautifully filmed and quite well acted movie and I don't hesitate the least bit to give it a good rating.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|It's The Big Bang Theory!  Need I say more!  My family owns all the seasons and no matter how many times you watch you always laugh!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I'm biased since I've been a James Bond fan since DR. NO, fading a bit during the Roger Moore ones, but returning full fledged with Daniel Craig.  I should also include Juidi Dench as M, and the surprising promotion of Miss Moneypenny.  All in all, this has all the action, subtle sexuality, humor, and basic looks of the best James Bond.  Well, maybe not best since I still think GOLDFINGER is the best James Bond movie ever, but very definitely good enough.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Didn't take to long to &#34;get into&#34; the book.  I liked the authors writing style.  Before I knew it I was hooked and always left me wondering what was going to happen next.  Great book and I've been recommending it to others.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was a strong dramatization of Lincoln's life and Spielberg is to be commended for giving it to us.  Daniel Day-Lewis was definitely great.  A fine movie for adults and school kids alike.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|A book to read in a bus station or an airport; then to throw away in the first available trash can... a very, very  forgettable reading
B005LAIH2W|4.0|As an Edgar Rice Burroughs fan, I truly loved the John Carter stories.  I'm sad that it bombed at the box office because I was hoping for the other Mars books by Burroughs to reach the screen.  I guess that won't happen.  I do hope though that sci-fi adventure fans who skipped it eventually see it.  And maybe somebody will someday give the story another try.
B000IOMYDY|5.0|I love Joy Division. Unknown Pleasures or Closer are indispensable records for anyone who loves post punk music!<br />&#60;3 JD
B005LAIISA|1.0|Once upon a time, this was one of the best animated series around.  Gag repetition and over reliance on what once worked seems to have killed this franchise and hopefully this latest one will be the last.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Forest Gump is foundational in my understanding of a monumentally important era. I didn't really live through any of it but I'm sure its loaded in nostalgia for those who did. Tom Hanks at his best, which is to say as good as it gets. Masterfully shot, and scored. Instant Classic
B008220DGE|1.0|I fear that I'm on the &#34;hate it side of reactions to this.  It looked so promising and I liked the idea that it seemed to be a take off on L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology cult.  Alas, it completely failed me.  I can't recommend this one.  Sorry about that.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|You should have a alarm system on kindle fire so you can wake up and listen to your favorite music
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Definitely one of the 21st centuries best films and likely to remain so throughout the century..  There was a lotn of talk about the torture scene, but that wasn't really offensive at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew everyone raved about this book, and it did not dissapoint.  The descriptions are vivid, and your really get inside Katniss' head.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I found this to be a quite disappointing film in this series.  And as others mentioned, Ben Kingsley was wasted.  I hope for better next time if there is indeed a next time.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I love this show.  The DVD's were in great condition, everything arrived fine.  Nothing to complain about - love the show!
B0099114WO|5.0|This has its risque moments, but it basically shouldn't offend.  Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, and Steven Carrell all play their parts well and this is a truly enjoyable movie with its humor but grounded in truth.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome book super great with lots of action<br />Sometimes think so real that I thought it was happening in front of me
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This was definitely one of last year's best films.  I really expected it to do better at the Oscars.  I did have qualms before I showed it to my movie group thinking that being from Tarantino, it might be too violent for a bunch of ladies over age 65, but it was well received.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game as long as you can hold out for more lives! I did not want this game and was talked into trying it. Now I cannot stop!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This definitely is one of the best aviation movies I've seen.  I do consider it one notch below great, but it comes pretty close.
B008BO61BE|5.0|The Upgrade of this Classic is excellent; love the live bonus tracks in the CD but the Dvd is the real deal, the performance of the band is top-notch i wish i could was there at the time!! buy it now and add it to your Judas Priest Collection, Best Band EVER!!!!
B0034G4OYA|3.0|Animated horror comedies are quite the thing these days.  This looked good to me, but it was just okay as a parody of the universal horror films of the 1940's.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Following Up the Masterpiece &#34;Screaming for Vengeance&#34; JP come with another Masterpiece but with a more Faster and Agressive feel, this no mean that is bad, is another big step for JP, this is the Beginning of another masterpiece We Know as &#34;Painkiller&#34;, instantly you can notice this upgrades that gonna keep you headbangin all the time till the album is over. Straight Heavy Metal dont hesitate to purchase this you will not regret it. Excellent Album!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This somewhat predictably was my favorite film, almost tied with LES MISERABLE of the 2012 crop of movies.  This is one I expect to see again and again.  It was also one of my film group's favorites.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the read.  The characters were great.  I love the Grisham novels.  Hard to put the book down.  Wanted to see what was going to happen next.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Thisn is truly a su8itable conclusion to the Christopher Nolan Batman series.  The quality is so high that even the women over age 65 in my movie group enjoyed it.  There were gasps at the ending, and that's to be expected.  This is a great conclusion to a great series about a great comic book character.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|I found the movie was very slow in picking up momentum.  Personally I feel that besides Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan other 007's just don't cut it.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is one of those films that gets better the second time around.  The plot would seem unbelievable if it wasn't basically based on a true story.  It's not all that serious.  There are well placed bits of humor too.  Acting was top notch and this is definitely a must see movie.
B003UN409Q|5.0|This film is an epic depiction of its time: from psychedelic tripping to ego-tripping. Jim Morrison is a true American tragedy. A touching waste of talent and life....
B00A81MV3U|4.0|If you don't know what an ensemble film is, this one will certainly teach you.  It fully deserved the four acting noms it got.  The film itself didn't strike me as great, but it was pretty darn good.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I just watched this movie on Netflix and I am just blown away. I know I will be watching it more than once, I can tell you that much. It is sobering, which is a cheesy thing to say but it's the truth. I love it and am so pleased that Denzel delivered another stellar performance. The directing and everything with this picture was really spot-on. That's all I need to say. See it, soon.
B005LAIIFS|2.0|I mistakenly thought this would be a sequel to the excellant LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS, and could not have been more disappointed.  I imagine very young children might like it, but that's about it.
0062290797|5.0|Excellent book about one of our country's brave warriors. The author is not going for glory but just letting us know what he and all our military are going through for us. It's even more bittersweet that the author was murdered after surviving harrowing deployments. He makes it home to his family and is reaching out to help his fellow warriors when one of them suffering from PTSD kills him and his friend. He went through HELL to protect us all only to be sent to HEAVEN too soon
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|This is a Promising start for what should be a long lasting franchise..  I was hoping for it to be of James Bond quality, but I don't think this quite attained that.  However, future Jack Reacher films could easily achieve the same populatity.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Really enjoyed the book looking forward to seeing the movie<br />Would liked to have known what happened to max and how  his life ended
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I doubt I'll bother seeing any sequels in this trilogy.  This movie just doesn't have the charm and over all quality of the LORD OF THE RINGS movies.  I considered the original book very minor to the main story and this goes for the movie also.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year. Loved it. Can't wait for the next one in the series to come out.
B00A83075M|4.0|This is more fun than I expected it to be.  Even the oldsters in my movie group enjoyed it.  Gamers especially should get a tremendous kick from this and I especially recommend it for them.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|Fun book series, good for young adult audience. The series is a fast-paced paranormal detective-type series and I enjoyed it. It isn't great literature, but it's a fun time.
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|I was told that this needs to be seen on a big screen.  Maybe so, but I don't really think the theater experience would have been all that much greater.  I expected more also from the cast.  And I would have appreciated a more accessible story line.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Finally someone has explained my life. I feel lucky that I understood what was happening to myself and am quite content with my life.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This truly was a delightful film.  The cast was absolutely top rate.  I will admit that Maggie Smith was my favorite in it, but they were all great.  The story definitely had its smiles although there was a bit of a serious uindertone.  Highly recommended.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|You would be stupid to think otherwise. This woman has real talent. Buy the album and you will not regret it
B003G4W49C|5.0|I only read this book because the movie was coming out, and I didn't know about the story until I saw the trailer.  The trailer made me want to see the movie and the movie made me want to read the book before I saw it.  I'm not a big science fiction person.  It's one of my least favorite genres.  I was totally captivated by the story.  I finish one book for every ten or so I start, so just having finished says something.  I also found the Intro to the book mesmerizing.... there's something about the way OSC writes that is very captivating, I can get lost in what he's writing even if it's an introduction to his book.  Very entertaining, what else can I say.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it because it has like 300 billion different dragons and you can play all day long it is my favorite game by a long shot it has no violence like almost every game I love it
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It doesn't work.<br />I am not going to spend real money to play a free game.  Could this be &#34;bait and switch&#34;?
1451678193|4.0|I've read a lot of vintage sci-fi books, and this one is definitely near the top of the list. Ray Bradbury has a unique voice, and his ability to pull the reader into his world is unmatched. A classic and definitely one to add to your collection.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I thought it was a great game, awesome graphics, and great characters. My favorite character is twin cities but Zeus is the strongest but it should be atom.
B0058SNI5S|5.0|I love wearing my Jaynas with dresses and skirts and have several different colors to go with various outfits.  The Jaynas are very comfortable, as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As good as any Grishsam. Someone will make a movie from this book. Great story, well told. Familiar for all of us who read A Time to Kill.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I don't really feel that much smarter after using this app tor the past 2 weeks, but it's fun and beats some other apps of the same kind. Would recommend.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story was interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next page, next chapter, etc.  It's a quick read.  The ending appeared to be a bit rushed, but maybe that was by design.  I couldn't put the book down for the last couple of chapters.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Mama does a great job of building suspense, taking the viewer on the roller-coaster ride with dipps and turns.  Add a touch of motherly love and BAM!  Instant classic.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Purchased this to replace a heavier case that's too bulky.  It holds the kindle snuggly and stays in place when I use it in stand mode.  The case is thin and light, which means it tucks into a satchel or purse easier and the bright red color makes it easy to find.  I'm happy.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's a good way to fill time while I'm waiting somewhere.  Some parts are easy but there is enough challenging parts to make it interesting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is such an amazing trilogy. All three books are great reads!! I've already read the first two twice :-)
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I'll say this for him, Ridley Scott knows how to create stunning visual worlds.  The vistas and visuals created in PROMETHEUS are breathtaking and believable; a futuristic expedition to one of Saturn's moons to--perhaps--discover mankind's ancestral roots sets a promising beginning--until we get to vet and learn about the various characters, who are not only exceedingly reckless, but hopelessly unlikable and petulant and petty.  Yet even these disadvantages are trumped by the non-climax. . .when we learn that, ultimately, PROMETHEUS is merely a mind-numbing prequel for (*spoiler alert!*) Scott's classic [[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien]].  Such a discovery garners little more than irritable ire and growing contempt; the viewer, having invested two hours into this increasingly silly romp, feels utterly ripped off.<br /><br />With the exception of Noomi Rapace (a poor man's Sigourney Weaver)--whose self-performed abortion promises to cause excessive squirming--PROMETHEUS presents a cast of forgettable, or completely unlikable, characters, from Michael Fassbender as a conniving humanoid, to Charlize Theron as the expedition's stone-faced, unemotional commander, to Logan Marshall-Green as the Rapace character's love interest who is so clueless and reckless his demise can be seen from a thousand clicks away.  As to the rest of the cast:  Who was in this movie?  Beats the stuffings out of me.  With an A+ for visuals, but an F- for plot, character assassination, and gilded conclusion, PROMETHEUS is a Ridley Scott offering I'll be happy to avoid on any and all future occasions.  If I want to experience the absolute terror so magically captured in 'Alien', I'll go to the original, thank you very much.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|I've been disappointed with games lately, mainly because of how much time I feel is wasted trying to unlock useless achievements, but this game held my interest, and if those annoying achievements are there I didn't see them. Was easy to learn, and challenging enough, without being too complicated, or repetitive. In other words I didn't want to throw my Kindle across the room. I haven't played this type of game before so I can't compare it to others, but I think they turned me into a fan.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|My students loved this movie, and even those who read the book were not disappointed by it.  A thought-provoking ending.
B00ET3VHZG|1.0|The Chess Pro display appears UPSIDE DOWN. Contacted their support but no follow-through or correction. Lousy game since almost unplayable!
B005JE7XW0|5.0|Best comedy horror movie Ive seen in some time. Good amounts of gore to satisfy any horror fiend with original comedy. Great cast with decent effects, not too much CG. If you like Evil Dead 3 and Idle hands, you will probably enjoy this flick.
0062127241|1.0|If Townsend's writing is any reflection of his personality, I suspect the only reason he had a life worth living is his luck in being a member of a famous rock band. Alternately, perhaps he's simply an extremely poor writer.  I struggled to get through the first 100 pages of disjointed and uninspiring recollections (or fantasies?).  Perhaps a book about Townsend limited to his experience with the WHO might be worth reading and then only if someone else actually penned it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The linking of the book &#34; A Time to Kill&#34; to this one was great..
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good app, Gives me everything I need to check the weather.  Very easy to read, would recommend to others to download this app
B0070NSPCU|5.0|An epic fantasy story that develops the main character amazingly over the course of the story.  I thoroughly recommend this novel to any and all fantasy fans.
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|Does not show actual pictures from the satellite of location, only draws lines for street names.. Google  Nexus play store has the better Google Earth
B00DSO9RMC|4.0|I read this book very quickly as i enjoyed it thoroughly.  I disagree with many of the negative reviews on here.  There was plenty of humour as well as mystery and thrills and spills.<br /><br />The development of the railway in the Discworld was an interesting turn of events but created a great story.<br /><br />While this is not in the realms of the best Discworld books of 8-12 years ago it is still a great read.<br /><br />I would recommend to all and any Pratchett fans.
0761169431|3.0|Just received this product in the mail. I had bought this for a five year old and the book CLEARLY states it is appropriate for age 9 and up despite being advertised on Amazon as age 5 and up.  Might be putting this away for four years until it is not simply a frustration for my five year old.
B001WCN23W|4.0|The tracks are great. The problem lies with  putting it on my computer. The tracks come off mislabeled. The music is the BEST !!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book with many questions to be answered. I really was surprised what the secret was and all of the consequences from the secret.
B006588YUE|5.0|Fit perfectly on an Intel LNA2011 processor on EVGA SLi motherboard.  This will be much more reliable than the Corsair Hydro which failed.  Solved my problem with CPU temperature shutdown.  Easy four screw installation and a plug.  The fan unit runs quiet and glows blue.
B00B1LN8WY|4.0|For years I intermittently watched the Friends series on TV in different stations. I am sure I watched some episodes for more than three times but not sure which one I missed. I hope to have my own Friends complete series and placed the order when the set was on sale in Amazon recently.<br /><br />The order was in two-day shipping but arrived one day earlier in surprise. The DVD set is brand new, and packed safely for shipping. I cannot wait to watch and finished the first disk (total 40 in 10 DVD folders) at one time. The disk looks great and plays well with no problem (based on one disk and I would expect the rest are perfect too, otherwise I will update here). I am very happy to watch the favorite movies episode by episode, instead of interrupted by ads on TV.<br /><br />I would give 5 stars since I like it. However, as the movies on DVD, the picture quality (resolution) is not as I expected. The DVD set should be made after 2004, right? Could it be made in higher picture quality? For this reason, I had to remove a star.<br /><br />Update 01/15/2014. I am slow, but seriously, I just finished the 6th Season, Disk 4. Had anyone had once watched \\"The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E, the first episode on this disk? Below are some scenes in this episode. Is this a messed one? Could I remove a star because of this disk?<br /><br />6th Season, Disk 4: The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E: The replay of Joey scene on the TV... Monica prepares food, the guy in her back talks \\"I like it dirty, dirty...\\"... Rachel quits her job... Phoebe massage on Rachel's boyfriend... Ross's sandwich... Chandler talks to the duck and chick about the moving... Chandler takes message for Joey's audition, Joey missed, since he is going to meet Monica's parents... Chandler plays foosball with Joey... Joey and Chandler talks about Chandler's kiss with his sister... Joey's girlfriend comes with Janice. Joey is locked in the furniture, everything in the apt is gone. Ross, Chandler and Joey talk about Joey's pants measuring... Ross fight with Rachel for the unfinished 18-page front&back letter. Monica and Rachel flick, fight, Phoebe drags both's ears... Joey wear all of Chandler's clothes. Joey plays pingpong, Chandler comes back with two Joey's special pizzas. Chandler gets the message for Joey again. Chandler and Joey hug too much (good)... Is this The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E?<br /><br />Update 01/16/2014. I had missed this episode on TV before, thanks to BHM in the comment for confirming the flashback structure. Was it too much flashback in this episode, making people lost in The One with What and WHAT? Anyway, let me give the star back.
B00447G29S|5.0|Great movie and its even better in 3D. Well done and a new Christmas Tradition with the Grand Children.  Fun to watch.
B008Q0AP2E|1.0|I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I guess I was waiting for a real story to develop. Then again, I have no emotions (empathy) for vampires so I don't care what happens to them. Leaves me wondering, do others?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy to use!  Fast streaming! The setup experience is a breeze to deal with! TV reinvented! Very good purchase
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Enthralling documentary. I'm always glad I'm sitting safely on my sofa when watching someone else perform death defying acts. The human spirit can be an incredible thing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really like this game.  It is good game for a 4+ years old, using dot to dot and creative thinking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It just a fun little game that helps clear the mind. Fun to help escape the worries of the world and clear the mind of troubling thoughts.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|Why didn't they film this originally in 3D?  Why the &#34;conversion&#34;.  I just won't spend the money on a post-conversion 3D.  Cheesy.  So I'll get the netflix Instant version when it comes out.  Sorry ... you show a movie in 3D you should film the movie in 3D like Avatar did.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|For those who like Joss Whedon's work, this is a must for the collection. Short, sweet, hysterically nerdy, and surprisingly touching. The songs are terribly clever, and incredibly catchy.
B002ZG976U|4.0|To much trouble for such a limited product, why are you bothering me for this, this is so<br />friggin stupid?
B00CM96A60|5.0|Great mix of vocals, beats and instrumental.  I love Armin van Buuren!  You will not be disappointed if you love trance!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great adventure and enormous fun.  Excellent CGI and a marvelous cast.  Can't wait to see the sequel - really looking forward to it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is super talented!!  I love the mix of violin and dub step.  Gets me moving in the morning! Love it!
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Beautiful production with a brilliant cast.  Villazon and Netrebko are both stunning vocally and visually.  They inhabit their roles with wonderful glee and warmth, as does the whole ensemble.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it was easy to find, buy and use! i will recommend it to anyone. thank you for the great app!
B004GTKP3S|4.0|I'd give this series a 4.5 star. It took a little bit for me to get used to it. Then I got hooked on it. It was really neat to see how people lived in that era. I enjoyed the actors and actresses, they really did a great job :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Easy read. Very entertaining. Looking forward to reading the next boom in the series. I would recommend this book to friends.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Markus Zusak has examined each word as a specimen under a microscope before he put them on the page.  He has then conducted them like a master conductor and created a beautiful symphony of words in The Book Thief.  A beautiful, beautiful book.
B00FVVR2ZO|2.0|Expensive, not able to complete collections! I am not on Facebook. This is a kindle. All my friends are asleep, all the time.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT CLASSIC.  I'VE NEVER  MET ANYONE WHO DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AND NOT JUST FOR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Played for hours on my PC when I had a chance, now I can take CCS wherever I go!!! Great game and works perfectly!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|The Mortal Instruments collection should appeal to any Twilight fans .<br />The City of Glass is essential in following the story line. Each book fills in gaps and makes the story fuller.
B001OFJPIS|5.0|I really enjoyed the first Hell Boy, and this was another great movie. If you like the first one, you will like this movie.
1607066017|5.0|This is one of the best comic books currently going. If you aren't reading it you should definitely consider picking it up. It's from the guy who did Y:The Last Man and Runaways. Read it. Now.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It kept my interest all the way to the end. Loved the twists and turns in the plot. Characters are memorable. Great read.
0756404746|5.0|I picked up this series on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I did. I read the first two books in a week and now I can't wait for the next one. If you're waiting for the next song of ice and fire book, consider picking up this series too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love app like crazy! I love love love love this game! you should play this game! to me it better than temple run. temple run I love like crazy to!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Second time I've seen this. Liked it a lot better the second time. The end felt more organic and flowed better with the story than I originally thought. McConaughey and the kid actors nail their performances and the writer/director really proves he knows what he's doing. One of the best of 2013.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady gaga's latest album takes us somewhat to the fame era... I love this album it shows a new different GaGa!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Majorly addicting. So fun, cannot put it down. Good thing it limits lives or I would be playing all the time and not getting anything done
0525953728|3.0|One of the first things I noticed when I began reading No Easy Day is that Mark Owen is not a writer. Kevin Maurer must have kept his hands off, because the writing is simplistic and lacks detail in many areas. However, it is not clear whether the lack of detail is due to Owen's limited writing ability or because he was intentionally vague to protect important details of the operation as well as his teammates' identities (example: Owen understandably never mentions whether or not he has a family of his own). My guess is that it is a mixture of both. Whatever the case, Owen is a soldier first; any shortcomings he has as a writer are understandable, even if they are somewhat frustrating for his readers.<br /><br />No Easy Day is an easy read presented in a (mostly) linear fashion. Owen flashes back to some of his previous experiences on deployment in the Middle East and does not talk much about the bin Laden mission until the middle of the book. Regarding the actual operation, he couldn't spill all the beans, but he still gives a clear account of how it all went down. Essentially, the story of the raid carries the book along and would have made it interesting even if Owen couldn't spell \\"SEAL,\\" and it is worth reading for that reason alone. Just keep in mind that it isn't the best book out there written by a former Navy SEAL (I would recommend [[ASIN:0316044695 Lone Survivor]] for more details about SEAL life and toughness).<br /><br />My above impression of the book being what it is (not as good as I had hoped but definitely worth reading), I am astounded by some of the criticism other reviewers have leveled against Owen. To refute some of the myths going around...<br /><br />First, some reviewers have claimed No Easy Day is one big ego trip. Hardly! Again, compared to other books written by former SEALs, Owen is on the lower extreme of the ego scale. He opens the book explaining that his purpose for writing it at all is to set the record straight about the operation and show that it was a team effort. Throughout, Owen remains humble, even pointing to instances where he reminded himself not to get caught up in the hoopla of having \\"been there\\" when bin Laden was killed. To anyone claiming Owen is arrogant based on No Easy Day, I invite you to read [[ASIN:0671795937 Rogue Warrior]] by Richard Marcinko (founder of SEAL Team Six) to get a taste of genuine egotism.<br /><br />Second, there are a lot of people sore over Owen's commentary on President Obama. Based on reviews here, I was led to believe this book flat-out smears Obama, which is entirely not the case. Owen mentions the Commander in Chief two separate times. He is critical of Obama the first time for non-political reasons (Owen and his teammates were tired of waiting for Presidential approval to launch the bin Laden raid, which seems perfectly reasonable). In the second instance, Owen admits he and his teammates are not fans of Obama (which is what reviewers are up in arms over) but then proceeds to praise the President for giving a good speech post-raid (which the aforementioned critics all conveniently neglected to mention in their reviews). Owen does make one comment about Biden acting like \\"a drunk uncle at Christmas,\\" but let's be real- Owen was simply making an observation that the majority of the American population has also made.<br /><br />Third and most important, there seems to be a lot of debate over how genuine Owen is in writing No Easy Day. A lot of servicemen, current and retired, have criticized him for being irresponsible at best and betraying his ethos to \\"cash in\\" at worst. Because of the high volume of passionate criticism Owen has received because of No Easy Day, I held off buying it for awhile. If his intention is indeed to make a cash grab, I was going to make sure I didn't shell out twenty bucks for his book. Ultimately, though, I decided the criticism was not heavy enough or unanimous enough to keep me from checking it out for myself. My impression strictly based on what I read is this:<br /><br />Owen is a decent enough guy. He gave credit to his teammates, didn't take much for himself, and at the end of No Easy Day announced his intention to donate the proceeds from the book sales to three different veterans' foundations, an honorable move.<br /><br />The problem is at least one of these organizations, the Navy SEAL Foundation, has rejected his offer and is refusing to accept any donation from Owen, presumably because the SEAL community takes issue with him writing it at all. Where, then, are the proceeds going? Are they going to the other two foundations? A different one not mentioned? Or are the critics right about Owen- has greed gotten to him?<br /><br />These are questions to which I have no answers. I paid one cent for a hardcover copy of No Easy Day, so whatever happens to be the case, I don't feel guilty for \\"supporting\\" Owen. He can keep my penny. However, I do think these questions warrant answering. Given the fact that Owen has legitimate reasons for laying low (I wonder if he ever intended for his real name, which I will not post here, to surface), it is unlikely we'll ever hear from him about the controversy. This makes it easy for his critics to attack him; it also makes it easy for him to swim in pools of cash the reader believes he has donated to a good cause. But once again, based only on what I read in No Easy Day, Owen seems like he's a stand-up guy.ion strictly based on what I read is this:<br /><br />Owen is a decent enough guy.

B000FVE3A2|5.0|This is a very substantial, solid watch.  For the price, you are getting great quality.  Apparently the watch has Seiko-made NH35A, 24 jewels movement which in all ways feels and looks great.  The the hour and minute hands are very luminous.  The watch is great for all occasions and you won't have to break the bank for a watch that matches the quality of other divers in the $600-$1,000 range.
B00B2FDF54|5.0|it was exactly as it was advertised.  and I love it!<br />New, and great price.  Great feel good movie... great cast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I seee what the mania is all about. This game is completely ADDICTIVE!!!  I spend way too much time playing it, but I love the different challenges and levels.  Playing quests to open more levels is wonderful - but, I  don't like waiting a day between quests.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|It was exactly how It was advertised and I love it!<br />I love the movie...  very inspirational.  A feel good movie.  :)
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|I was excited to see another game by GabySoft after playing through the Free App of the Day FlipPix game they also made. As soon as the tutorial started up I knew I was going to have problems if they didn't have a color-blind mode. Sadly I quickly discovered they didn't have one. I tried to play one anyway, but on my first move tried coloring a ring of purple blue.<br /><br />The game itself was polished and looked great as I would expect based on other titles I have seen from them. The tutorial was short and to the point, providing just enough guidance and beginning techniques to get started. Since I want able to play past the tutorial I can't speak for the content itself, but with three skill levels and lots of puzzles I would imagine this could easily be hours of entertainment if you love logic puzzles.<br /><br />If you are color-blind I would recommend you skip over this app for now, but I do plan on keeping an eye on it in case they add that support in the future. I can't give it more than three stars as someone that is colorblind, but if I wasn't I would give it a 5.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved this movie....  It would have been nice, however, if the movie included more detail about the society/world the characters live in, specifically how the Hunger Games came to be, along with the segregated way participants lived compared to what appears to be the mainstream world????  Still good.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. A well orchestrated scripting and combination of actors bring this farce to life.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|You should get this app is you like the movie I liked it soon getting it the others say it is good so I might be
B00DPUB59W|5.0|What a wonderful story (yes... it may seem strange to say that for a vampire movie).<br />I'll not spoil it.<br />We just loved it from the beginning to the end and want to see it again.<br />The acting is terrific!<br />Byzantium brings something new and refreshing.<br />Warning! Not for &#34;Twilight&#34; hardcore fans though...or... maybe...who knows....lol!
B00400NHRO|4.0|In the spirit of Catch 22 this novel wakes us up to existential reality of human suffering and the absurdity of societal institutions. It made me acknowledge the unfair expectations we place on physicians. I don't think I could have finished the book had it not been for the deliberate humor which helped ease the tension. A serious commentary on the practice of medicine told through satire - dark humor- not for the faint hearted!  Samuel Shem challenges doctors not to fall victims but to transcend, feel, and embody compassion.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A phenomenal ending to an entertaining and engrossing trilogy!  Can't wait for the movie release!  I have to write five more words.
B000FCJZUO|5.0|I loved the book P.S. I Love You --- and feel the same about this book.  I was a little skeptical at first, since the entire book is written as written correspondence between the characters, but have found that I've enjoyed this new 'take' on reading.  The story flows well and I can definitely envision this book becoming a movie someday.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|One of the most fabulous movies of all times! A classic romance film that you cannot go wrong with! Highly recommend!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Like his style of writing…a bit too descriptive when he describes &#34;murders&#34;.  Don't need as much gore as he includes.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is easy and hard.  Kids like  it until they cannot figure it out.  Can sometimes be a challenge for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An emotional story...it took me a while to understand who was writing...Death..lovely death....saddened death...insightful death.  An excellent book..<br />Demonstrates humanity at its best and at its worse.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Granddaughters and their parents play often.  All enjoy it.  I have not tried it, one of the girls actually played as me.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Addictive little game. Love that it free and fun. But hate that u don't get more tickets to buy things. But other that that I love it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Simply Excellent, it is much better than the Star Trek Series or movies of the Next Generation. Worth the Purchase
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I think its probably good bit it wont install I don't know why its weird I wished it installed I would love if it did
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is literally the most inspiring book I've ever read.  I've never even met Adam and I feel a connection.  When I make it to heaven I will be sure to embrace this fearless warrior. Thank you Adam for being fearless and a devout Christian. Just WOW!!!!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great calculator! Simple, clean and intuitive interface. Rivals the real thing and includes a virtual tape! I use it every day and you should too! I recommend it highly and without reservation!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app seems to tidy things up nice and simple without any work or much specification from the user.  Does a great job  and its totally free, the only thing I have been asked to do is give a rating, which is well worth it. Great app!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game challenging also can be slow going  each new game is different so you don't get bored so enjoy this game
0694003611|5.0|As always- I love this true classic. Its a nice sturdy board book. Definitely worth the price and even more.
006202406X|5.0|MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW<br />********************<br /><br />I'm going to attempt to be coherent here, but no guarantees.  I read this book straight through last night, staying up until well past midnight reading/crying.  I am so, so proud of how Veronica Roth decided to end it.  I think that killing off the main character is the bravest thing an author can do.  It takes guts to kill of a character who has been born and grown in your mind through such an eventful series, and tears aside (and there were MANY TEARS SHED), I'm kind of glad she did it.  This story needed to have an emotionally BIG ending, and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Other thoughts: you really couldn't have predicted most of the events of this book.  The beginning did seem to drag a lot in its lengthy information dump, and it was often confusing which side was what and why they did what they did.  The point was that everyone was morally complex and ambiguous, and I get that, but introducing a new big bad and making it so confusing got overwhelming easily.  I think that says more about me as a person than the book itself, as I think we humans are not very well conditioned to accept complexity.<br /><br />I'm so happy with the way Four's story was resolved.  I knew someone was going to die, and I hoped it wasn't him, and I'm really selfishly happy that, for once, the character with the tragic backstory doesn't have a tragic ending.  It's empowering to read a book where an abuse survivor is a main character and he comes out alright.  That means the world to me.  I am also extremely satisfied with the way Tris and Four's relationship exists in the story.  Unlike a lot of book couples, there was no overblown love triangle, and while there were certainly heightened emotions, there were a lot of meaningful discussions.  When a problem came up, either Tris or Four would pull their partner aside and mention that they should talk and proceeded to do so.  Talk about setting a great example for a healthy relationship, especially where one character has tendencies toward unhealthy relationships.  Again, extremely satisfying to see in a work of popular fiction.<br /><br />I honestly think this was the perfect ending to the series, but as it is with subjective opinions towards books, YMMV.  We may have lost a dear character, but as Veronica Roth has stated, this wasn't something she relished doing.  This was something that had to be done for the greater story, and that is something to be respected.<br /><br />This has been a good year for powerful, meaningful young adult novels.<br />Thanks, Veronica Roth.ionship, especially where one character has tendencies toward unhealthy relationships.

B007RGYXOO|5.0|I won a copy of this book in a giveaway hosted by Sanna @ Fanciful Fictions.<br /><br />I really loved reading this book. I thought the author did such a wonderful job with this touchy subject. So many people are afraid to talk about suicide. Like, if we don't talk about it, it doesn't happen. But in reality, it happens all the time. Since I graduated high school in 2007, there have been 8 suicides of students and teachers from my school. Two teachers and six students. I don't know what's going on there, but something needs to be done. I know so many schools are trying to stop bullying, but as this book will show you, its not always obvious that bullying is taking place.<br /><br />Hannah was a student that never really fit in, but coasted through school, wanting it to be over. However, events that occurred at school and outside of school led her to take her own life. In these thirteen tapes, we find out what happened that led to this outcome. Hannah readily admits that she was the one to decide to take her life; no one else forced her to. But these events she describes explains why she did it.<br /><br />What I liked about this book is that it explains that there wasn't one particular thing that happened which led to her suicide. It was so many different little things that most people would think you could just brush off. But when these little things keep happening to you, it creates a snowball effect, as described in the book. I feel that when many people think about suicide and why someone did it, they want to know the one reason it happened. When in reality, there isn't usually one answer; its usually a compilation of little things, and even the smallest thing, like not noticing a haircut, or using someone for a ride, can set a person down a dangerous spiral towards suicide.<br /><br />I also really loved that it was narrated by both Hannah and Clay. We heard what led Hannah to her suicide, and throughout her tapes, we hear Clay's reactions. It becomes incredibly clear that Clay really liked Hannah and is pained by her loss. He tends to blame himself for not noticing signs of potential suicide. But unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20, and when you're in the moment, a lot of people don't notice the 'signs.' I really liked his character and thought he and Hannah were both well-rounded and intriguing characters to the story.<br /><br />Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.comy clear that Clay really liked Hannah and is pained by her loss.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|though we all know how it ends, it still is an interesting and well written book.  a good read all around.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I really like the movie.  I think that if I rent the video that I should  have more than 24 hours to view the movie.  It should be accessible a bit longer, like minimum 3 days and maybe maximum 7.
0525953728|5.0|My husband enjoyed the book.  He grumbled when I gave it to him saying he had enough things to read.  Well, he's not grumbling any more.  He would tell me daily about all the fascinating things he read about the Navy Seals, and he finished reading the book in a week (and this is a person who seldom reads books, only financial reports).
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not like the original mahjong, but don't mind playing still.  Not real clear on the different options availabe before playing.
B003L20IJW|4.0|Great movie for the entire family. My 4 yr old loves it. If she is misbehaving a tell her Nanny McPhee might come visit and she becomes an angel.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Nowhere near as fun as the original. Fortunately it was free.  Why do these reviews require a lengthy write-up to publish?&#34;
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not this book is excellent. If you haven't seen the movie yet please don't watch it. Get the book and I promise you'll enjoy it.
B00CKKDZ2S|3.0|I love the cards and their messages. They are very user friendly and I find them thought provoking. I like having them easily accessible on my kindle.The art is also nice. I just don't like having to pay for improvements in the software since it was promised as free. I did a past, present, future spread and had to pay $1.99 in order to see the future card. I was okay with that but then I got asked for another $1.99 for more music. I feel like this is the beginning of being nickel and dimed to death so that's why the 3 stars. I'd give more if I was only asked once for money to continue.
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|Several of the songs don't play all the through! The album itself is very good, one of his best I believe.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's difficult the adjust the screen on my kindle so that the words are big enough for me to read. This causes the program to slow down with changing screens. Sometimes the screen freezes and I have to leave FB to unfreeze my kindle. This is not a problem with a larger reader screen but still a tad aggravating.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|It fits, screen protector is easy to put on, phone has survived a couple of drops since then.  Excellent product for the price.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is AWESOME if you don't have it get it of you don't have money get a job or if your a kid just do chores... ya it's that good.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Lots of action. I have it 4 stars because it was a little long at 2hrs and 14 minutes. It was funny at times. Overall entertaining.
0316098515|5.0|Quite possibly the most extensive cookbook I own. Absolutely breathtaking in its scope and range. It covers classical French, modern American, Spanish... The staples recipes in the back could be a cookbook all on its own. Great for components, things you can take from certain recipes and apply them elsewhere. Best investment an aspiring, or even current, chef can make.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This was my first Preston Child book. I was pleased with characters, plots and twists without<br />giving away the ending. I will read more of his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really fun and a great distraction from homework. I love it . I spend many hours procrastinating playing this game.
B008MM9630|5.0|Enjoyable game and I like the fact that I don't have to bug my friends with requests in order to complete tht different quests.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|It's not in English. I think it's in German or Russian. So unless you understand another language I would not purchase this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]][[ASIN:B00GH0E2TW Allied: First Contact]]Like most of readers I bought this crappy book out of curiosity and had difficulty reading it for all the reasons already mentioned in different reviews. I feel the same way.<br />But what interests me is how such a mommy porn became a best seller.<br />Well, here is my views on this.<br /><br />You need lots of contacts, superb publicist and write a fantasy characters with enormous sexual desires and make them super humans.<br />Christian Grey the Dominant, that is what he likes to be called is created a demigod with every thing which even makes James Bond a choirs boy. The protagonist is an innocent girl in twenties just graduating, has no clue about sex WOW<br />All this spiced with repeated and boring sexual encounters makes it a best seller. If this book was written by an unknown writer who had no publicist or big contacts, it could have never been published.<br />Another point baffles me is that I found Mr Christian Grey character who calls himself Dominant and protagonist is submissive i.e. a sex slave girl by choice though I am a male but I was expecting women's liberation org. up to arms for demeaning the gender,<br />But rather they not only accepted it but nothing mentioned against about sex slavery.<br />Now a movie is in offing WOW.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show with great characters! Smart and sexy with the perfect dash of humor mixed in. Within the first couple of minutes I was hooked, and have since watched both seasons twice (which is not hard to do because there are only 3 episodes per season)! Each episode is 90 minutes so it takes a commitment to sit down and watch it, but it'll go by in a flash, it's just that good! My favorite is the first episode of the second season, &#34;A Scandal in Belgravia&#34;, the actress who plays Irene Adler is fantastic and makes me wish I was a bad ass dominatrix like her. I can't wait till the season 3 premier in January 2014!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar has outdone themselves with this super...super game.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden objects games.  The story line, graphics,are are superb.  I buzzed through this with excitement and hated to see this game end.  I give this a 10 recommendation.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This a great game for kids just make sure you block it so they can't buy diamonds that are like 100 dollars.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is my husbands favorite movie great condition delivered fast. I would suggest to anyone! Great gift got it for him for Christmas he loved it. Great seller!
B000002U82|4.0|This is another of my Favorite Pink Floyd CD's.  I recommend it, but like most Floyd Albums... it just depends on your Mood when you are picking out a Floyd CD to listen to.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's cute, fun, and challenging at times. I like figuring out the right way to cut the ropes so Om Nom gets the candy.
B000002LQR|3.0|I liked RHCP more when I was in my 20's, and now that I'm in my 40's - it's a nice piece of music to hold on to.... but no longer one of my favorites.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Fun game to beat boredom and waste time. You can play alone or with a partner. It can help build vocabulary. The game has several subjects to choose from, including Spanish.
B000000W5N|4.0|This is one of my favorite Stones albums (CDs).  I definitely recommend it, and it is a MUST HAVE for a Rolling Stones Collector!
111846446X|4.0|This is a good book for those venturing out into the Pi World (getting away from clunky old desktop PCs). Good for tinkerers too. Though written for kids trying to learn programming, has just enough hardware to make it very useful to have around.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Love this CD.  It's one of my Favorites and I've purchased it a total of 3 times since it was originally released.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The app is pretty good for logging on to Twitter. The app doesn't have a very clearly defined interface though.
B00EMIE0CA|5.0|Spyro-Gyra is back again. And this time displaying good vibrations. During three days in a New York studio, this band demonstrates the reason why they have been on the great stages during more than three decades. A true institution.<br /><br />Every track is a winner. Versatility and superb virtousity. This album must be included into the twelve best albums of the year.<br /><br />Don't leave it aside. You will love it and surely will listen it over and over. Five stars? Why not one hundred ones?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is a good way to explore the layout and workings of your Kindle. Since the Kindle's OS is based on Android, which is based on Linux, and if you're curious on how it works, I would recommend this. I wouldn't recommend rooting your Kindle unless you're customizing it (you could really mess things up if you don't know what you're doing).
B008M721MS|4.0|This is a good app for people who like to chat with friends or discuss business, but there are some cons to this app. But what am i saying im 10
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app brings the ability to connect to your HP printer using you Kindle. Like the ePrint online feature. Allows you to print from just about any device that can send images and whatnot to an email address.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I have read all the books.  So when the movie came out I was stoked.  It is really a fun fun fun movie.  I wish someone else had played the kids part though, I don't like Will Smith's spoiled brat of a son and that was a turn off for me and the only reason I didn't give the movie a 5 star rating.  Will Smith as an actor rocks, he needs to bend his son over his knee though!
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Great adaptation of Tolkien's classic. Can't wait for the second part to come out! Like the idea it is always available from the Cloud storage, so I can watch it anywhere at anytime.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's Star Trek.  Since the first movie, they have ALL been GREAT, well maybe not Star Trek 5, that one sucked.
B008LH4YYC|4.0|This app is a must have for any Kindle user. It needs a more refined interface to find what you're looking for.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Plays multiple formats. Easy to see which video is which too--plays first part of all the videos.  Easy to organize. My four and five year olds can manipulate through it much easier than iTunes format on an itouch.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addictive but challenging... lots of fun. Sometimes you are on the same level for days and then it is frustrating and it's not fun any more.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The ultraviolet was a godsend.<br />The bluray and DVD were functional but ultraviolet is best xD<br />Also, amazing movie, epic cast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to delete the pirated version I had on my kindle fire of this game.  This app runs really smooth and I haven't had any crashes! A++++++++
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like this investigative-lawyer sitcom a lot. They are great at letting you know of hidden plots in a clever way. It has twists and turns that make you want to watch the next episode.
B0081336FO|5.0|These are entertaining, suspenseful and riveting retellings and new tales of the master detective and his assistant!<br />The characters are empathetic and the acting and action surpurb!!  MORE please!!!!!
B004GNFTX0|3.0|It is just mildly interesting.  The characters are not particularly strong.  I needed to get almost 1/2 way into it for a plot to arise.  It is very dry and not really thought provoking.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was great book!  I only wish it would have been longer.<br /> Also when you read the background and realize that the author used real found photos to fuel such a fantastical story, It makes it all the more impressive. I cant wait to get the sequel.  Highly recommended!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|A vision of the future where a threat, not all that dissimilar in form from Godzilla, comes from the Sea and lays waste cities along the Pacific Rim.  Where human kind, in its defense creates weapons to counter these monsters.  These weapons are as large and powerful as the monsters from the deep.  In their contests on land, the devastation in the cities is wrecked as much by the weapon, a Jaeger, as by the neoGodzillas.  The Jaeger must be manned by two pilots who, essentially, mind-meld involving left-brain from one pilot and right-brain from the other.  This is, of course, using our rational and creative/emotional natures in harmony and relies on a sharing of memory, experience harnessed to monstrous creation of Science.  There is much to explore and to consider in this director's work beyond the generally good performances of the actors and the massive special effects.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Nice detail on the subtleties of the story: her father's phobias, Miss smith's simpleness, Miss Bates' tragedies - which contributed to her nervous habits.<br />And the heroine, herself more realistically told with youthfulness and naïveté that Miss Austen intended us to feel, by her own description:<br />Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, &#34;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&#34;[1] In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as &#34;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich.&#34; Emma, however, is also rather spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.
B009ZM74F8|2.0|I think the writer of this movie must have watched 1984, Pink Floyd The Wall, Logan's Run, THX 1138, The Matrix and Ultraviolet and then decided to compress them into one movie. If you want to save some time, watch Equilibrium. But if you want to watch better movies, watch the 'originals'.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|This is my second book by Jonathan Bello and once again the author did not fail to deliver. Again he digs deep in the human psychology and helps the reader understand how the human brain functions and how positive affirmations can drastically improve one's life. The author guides throughout the process of understanding the positive affirmations and gives good examples how they can be used to extract maximum value from them. A very interesting read`
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Couldn't stop reading once I started! This is first book I've read by Kate Morton and won't be the last. She has an amazing writing style and I so enjoyed this book.
B00F031WB8|5.0|I couldn't wait for this DVD to be released as I attended the Miami Pop Festival.  The audio and film quality of the Miami Pop Festival songs is better than expected.  We got lucky that Eddie Kramer was at Miami Pop to oversee the audio recording / mixing.  The documentary is also terrific and I believe it's a longer version than the American Masters show that recently aired on PBS.  A MUST HAVE for Hendrix fans!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|By the time I finished the first puzzle I felt like I had a good grasp on the puzzles. The best hint I read is to double tap the blocks that only has one color in it so you can see exactly which box goes with it. If it weren't for that I'd have a hard time because sometimes I assume the wrong box is the correct box when there are a couple boxes touching it. I think the difficulty levels are perfectly paced so that you don't get bored or frustrated. You can get hints if you're stuck , I'm not sure if hints are limited or not, and I don't think it makes you start over if you get a bunch of mistakes whichis helpful when you're first trying to figure the game out. This is good for passing time when you're bored and want to relax because it's not frustratingly hard at all. I do like the FlipPix Art apps (by same developer) better and would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes puzzle apps and I would recommend the HexLogic apps to anyone who likes the flippix apps.
B000089RVX|5.0|This Grammy Award winning album is the high quality of Evenanescence and contains the hit song My Immortal both in purely accustic (piano) form and the more popular rock version.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|Horrible cheesy acting. Awesome eye popping robot vs monster fights. Acting was cringe worthy. It felt like the actors were imitating the over the top emotions of a anime. I would not recommend this easily.
B005GVA2L0|3.0|This is a very dissapointing album with the reformed band.  They lack something essential that led to such hits as My Immortal and Lithium in their first albums.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved this book. I liked that it wasn't the predictable series that many of these types have become. I would hold it right up there with Hunger Games. Thanks for something different.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|great movie and love the characters. the reluctant dom, james spader, and the eager sub, maggie gillinall, are funny and loveable at the same time.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Cinematography was great, plot was ok.  Since it did not use the format of Band of Brothers, you were never quite sure where the line between fact and fiction was, so this made it all seem like fabrication (to me) -even though I did recognize a few items I knew had happened.<br /><br />So, because there was no contact with the real men and women who served, it seemed disconnected, even if it was 100 percent accurate, it still seemed a bit of a stretch in places.<br /><br />What tossed me overboard quickly was a scene on the Naval vessel, sailing to the Pacific for combat in early 1942, and some Marine sitting in the galley asks, &#34;What are we doing, anyway?&#34; -or something like that.<br /><br />I'm sorry.  Hollywood cluelessness.  No Marine, in early 1942, and no American, would have been asking what they are doing here.. not after Pearl Harbor, its just not happening.  So, that was like a stereotype Viet Nam era remark from a Hollywood writer and not a US Marine in 1942.<br /><br />So, although it was a good watch, it had its limitations.  Without a tie to real people in any obvious way, it seemed less engaging, sort of like watching Platoon for WWII or something.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|It downloaded easy to my android and is very easy to use. You can read any book, magazine, etc. You don't have to go out and buy one, that's nice you just have it on your phone!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finally! We get to find out what happened to Danny! Great story! I didn't want to put it down and hated to see it end.
0399157573|1.0|I have been a fan of Ms Cornwells work for many years but must agree with some of the other reviewers that the last few books have been drawn out, that been said I was willing to stick with her until now.  I have read the first four chapters of this book and I am appalled by the inclusion of the Sandy Hook tragedy not even a year since it occurred. Shame on you Ms Cornwell.
0811876373|5.0|So...I have to admit that I've never made a single cake pop out of this book, BUT the book is really cute and the photos are really pretty.  My 2.5 year old daughter loves flipping through it and looking at all the fun pops.  :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game a great deal, but have become discouraged since I can't seem to master level 23 after several months of trying.  I'll get 29/30 sometimes, but CANNOT master level 23.  Would LOVE to be able to skip that level!
B00B2166BS|5.0|takes way less time charge my nexus now. should have been what came with it. just wish it was a little cheaper
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I first read this book around 4th grade, but still i find myself coming back to it every so often. An easy read, but a great story from an entertaining perspective.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Bought this for my mom. She saw it on AMC and thought it was funny, and OMG is it funny. I love these older movies, and Cary Grant is hilarious.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game, which is too slow regenerating time.  Difficult to keep going without buying time or crystals.  I will persevere.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have never read anything from this author before but I will now! This book did a wonderful job of showing how people are all connected without even knowing how we all inadvertently affect each other. the story makes you stop and think about what you would do if you were placed in these situations. It was an amazing read!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Intriguing, well developed, quirky characters, absorbing plot. Loved the story.  Can't wait to read the next one and find out what happens to our reluctant hero.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game is fun until you realize you have to spend money to buy help to beat the levels.  I would not recommend this until they made the game fair or totally free.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|Great Jack Johnson music. Mellow and relaxing. Always feel good music from Jack. In Between Days is still my favorite though.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really liked the whole series. This one just threw me for a loop when she changes perspectives from Tobias to Tris at the chapters. I had to keep going back and checking to see who was &#34;talking&#34;. Other than that it was really good. I couldn't put it down!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king does it again. I didn't know this was a continuation of the shining when I purchased it. The author was good enough for me. A terrific spellbinding story that, as always, has you on the edge of your seat. Thank you Mr. King for many years of wonderful, scary, nail biting, sleepless nights.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Why buy a used one for almost the same cost?!? I love my brand new record, such a classic. I couldn't find it for a reasonable price anywhere else.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This camera is awesome and terrific because I can have the opinion to either take videos and pictures with this camera.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a handfull of sharpeners, and to be completely im not &#34;shaving sharp&#34; talented on a stone. These pocket and countertop sharpeners fill the void between a skilled knife sharpener and a novice.  With a handfull of swipes just about anyone with a fairly steady hand can put a respectable edge on a knife.  If i break or loose this pocket model i wont think twice about ordering another, it a very handy tool to have in your pocket or glovebox if you need to touch up a edge.  Thinner bladed knives will sharpen up quicker, this little gem did wonder on my S.O.G  Warning its small, and if you have a very dull blade you would be better served to start your edge with another device as you just hold this one with a couple fingers and drag your blades through it.. If anything i would even go as far as saying this is a little on the unsafe side if your not holding onto the device very ,very firmly.  I will keep my already sharp knives in top shape with the occasional swipe through this device.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|I got what I expected, physical mayhem, fantastic feats of strength and Daniel Craig.  The story was more interesting than I expected.  I hope M is not replaced.  I enjoyed it but it is Bond and that is all there is to say.
006202406X|1.0|Stop on book 2 and make up your own ending. You'll thank me later. I don't even want to watch the movie now, because I know how this ends. Will never read again.
B008S80OU2|5.0|This is the perfect collection, all in one box.  An amazing bargain for so many pristine CD's of life-enhancing music.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book certainly kept my interest,  it always kept you guessing what would happen, there were some unexpected twists throughout the book,  there were some interesting characters and the author did a good job of getting the reader to get to know the major characters,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't speak personally to the game, but my husband plays it quite often. So I guess it's a winner!
0439023521|3.0|The book of second hand is Ok. But I have been waiting for 3 weeks and i paid and extra for arrive earlier.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was quite skeptical about this book at first. But when I got attached and understood Will and Lou I had no doubt that they were going to fall in love. This books really pushed the limits of &#34;but what if love is not enough&#34; and &#34;if you truly love someone, you should also honor his /her's decision&#34;. If you loved The Fault in our Stars and sobbed, this book will leave you bawling at 2:53 am . All in all, this book was beautiful
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|No matter how much I get aggravated by the game I still can not seem to be able to put it down for very long at all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is easy to set up and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I now have one on every TV in the house.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I enjoy the challenge and the fact that you must think ahead before you move a card from one pile to another.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun  and addicting. Love to play every day. More fun than house work. Gotta go time to play another round.
0802473628|5.0|Great depth. Chapman expresses in simple language the time tested truths, found in the great philosophies, of communicating<br />love to your love one
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I mainly purchased it to use while travelling and watching shows on the hotel TV via my Note 3 android phone.  However I cannot get it to setup via my phone.  Even if I could, the only thing I can watch for free is youtube.  3rd party developers have written apps that allow you to use the chromecast for many other things, such as AllCast, but google releases a mandatory update to chromecast which blocks those applications.  Google clearly wants you to only use it for media services you have to pay for.  They are not trying to help you out.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Yes my kindle hd has a camera, but not a video. I use the video. I also wish you could take pics and video the other way. This app is worth 99 cents to me.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|THE BATMAN COMIC THAT STARTED IT ALL BABY! This movie is EXACTLY THE COMIC! Great voices and the story is legendary. I got the second half also and it was equally EPIC!
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Very disappointed. I expected  a spy novel with intrigue and a fast paced story with a good plot. What I got was &#34;Chick Lit&#34; full of the emotional ups and downs and romantic adventures of a young women. Not my cup of tea.
0307455874|3.0|This is more of a book by a politician unlike &#34;Dreams from my Father&#34;. Even though I like the author the book itself was a difficult read for me and seemed to plod along.
6305882592|5.0|Ah, Harold and Maude, Maude and Harold.  This movie is one of my all-time favorites in the dark comedy genre, which is where I would place it.  I have watched it on TV every time I've been able to find it, but after asking my 19-year old aspiring-director-to-be grandson if he'd seen it, he said he had not.  So, I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />It's not HD.  It's the 1971 movie on DVD and it didn't cost much.  We watched it together last night and he found it very entertaining.  The actors and plot have been described eloquently by other posters and I won't attempt to add anything else to that.<br /><br />There were a couple of places where he said, &#34;Oh, Grandmama, why'd you make me watch that?&#34; And those of you who have seen it know the scenes of which I'm speaking.  For the rest of you, I'm not gonna spoil it.  Let's just say  my grandson found a couple of scenes to be offensive to him.<br /><br />If you like laughing and crying at the same time, buy it.  You'll love it, I think.
0739328190|5.0|Excellent read. Well written in a nice style. Less politics and more biography in a book that seems genuine. I enjoyed this book.
1883217040|2.0|Actually found this book a little dense and I have a math and music background. This is definitely not useful for the casual pianist or musician. Probably more suited to someone receiving lessons or classes.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|The title is so very apt-the book fairly crackles with the quick movement of the story line! I've enjoyed some of their earlier books more but this one moves so well, like an avalanche with its intensity. I found myself reading far into the night and having to go back and reread some that I had skipped through too quickly for complete comprehension. The scenes of the many fires were so alarming, the descriptions so frightening that I had trouble<br />visualizing how someone could depict the scenes with such intensity. Great story?
B00GH4R95C|2.0|For all the money that was spent on this movie, the action, and the computer animations, this movie is a complete bust. No emotional attachment. Incoherent plot. Really disappointing reboot. Pretty to look at but overall a waste of time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the best books Stephen King ever wrote. I actually cried at the end of it, it was so easy to believe that this could really happen. I couldn't put the book down. I Love Stephen King KD Florida
0765348780|3.0|I picked up Gardens of the Moon because I was looking for a smart, adult fantasy series to delve into. There's plenty of fantasy out there but I wanted something with intelligent writing and mature characters, and Erikson's series came so highly recommended.<br /><br />I put the book down no less than five times before deciding to power through to the end. I'd paid for the book, after all, I might as well read it, even if I had hit the 200 page mark and found not a single character or plotline I cared about in the least. It was all the things that fantasy does wrong--self-important, muddled, and, I felt, willfully unwilling to open the windows and let a little light in on what was going on.<br /><br />Then around page 300 we get to know Kalam and Quick Ben and I suddenly started to like these characters. And then Rallick became interesting. Characters who had been played up as throwaways developed personalities. I found myself WANTING to read through to the end.<br /><br />So a year later, I'm actually invested enough in this book to pick up the sequel. Fine, you win, Gardens of the Moon, I want to know what happens with these characters next. You won me over.<br /><br />Not a ringing endorsement, I know, but if you're like me, waiting for the next George Martin book, and you've already read Patrick Rothfuss and Joe Abercrombie's brilliant new work, and you're sad Glen Cook isn't producing any more Black Company books, the Malazan series isn't an awful way to pass the time. I only hope the next book picks up the pace a bit.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Very entertaining action movie, based on popular book series.  Whatever you think of Tom Cruise, the individual, and I happen to be a middle-aged skeptic on many things, I have to admit  that this movie is highly entertaining, and that he brings an intensity to a movie that others do not.  This movie is no exception.<br /><br />There was even a little unexpected social commentary here & there (OK, I  'fess up:  I haven't read the book).<br /><br />So, even if the hero by the same name in the book (or so I hear-)  was a 6'5&#34; guy with blonde hair and blue eyes, which doesn't remotely describe  Mr. Cruise, he still did a heckuva job, and this was a very entertaining testosterone flick, by any measure.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|Zendaya not only has great dancing talent, she sings beautifully as well. Love all songs on the album.<br />Great gift idea.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyable and easy to read. Quite interesting look into some of our American history. One of those stories that you wish wouldn't end when it did.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I needed to read the whole thing but it was very drawn out. Got boring after a while. The first two books were better.
B00005YJMX|5.0|I love this film because it tells what some would call a horror story in a way that creates sympathy for the vampire, is not horrible and has an amusing end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I did not realize this was an Indie book, only that it was the REST of the short story I had read and I wanted... NO... NEEDED more. I have only praise for Hugh and this fascinating post-apocalyptic read: riveting, gritty and real, intense, addictive, completely immersive, amazing, well-written... the list of adjectives goes on, but you get the idea. Well developed characters, plot twists that kept me clicking the forward button on the Kindle, and a believable story line that continued to develop in new and exciting ways.<br /><br />Hugh, you may have started out strumming that guitar in subway stations – but soon you’ll be playing nothing but Carnegie Hall. I am so happy to have discovered &#34;Wool&#34; and have already added “Shift” to my list of upcoming Kindle titles.
B001EC2IT4|4.0|Classic story told through Tim Burton's unique perspective.  Michael Keaton shines, Geena Davis glows, and Alec Baldwin puts on a great performance before he was typecast.  And Winona!  Just about everything you could want from a late eighties twisted-comedy romp.  Fun for the whole family!
1250038820|5.0|Great story.  Great product. Great gift idea.  Everyone would like to receive this book for the holidays.  Follow him on Facebook as the story continues.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Amazing band, amazing album. So much talent in such a small group.<br /><br />If you were to get to know me, you would quickly learn that I do not listen to the radio, and I generally do not favor pop music. These guys, however, make pop music sound..... awesome. It's hard to explain. At any rate, these guys are definitely worth checking out - they totally killed it.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I have this game from the first to the second, there. Both Awesome! Hoping they will come out with the third installment,  great graphics and smooth playing.<br />They have many levels if you buy the whole game.  Play the free game to see if you like it. The levels are story, challenge, play at your whim on the one with no timer!  I think there is one more. There are 60 levels on each level you play.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thank you brothers<br /> For creating this app that we can download.  My mother loves it as she can now control the size of the letter to better read the bible and she also is not computer savvy in her opinion but I showed where to look and she is now a pro . thanks Jehovah for always providing what we need at the proper time.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so disappointed. Loved the first two books but this one fell flat. There was no flow to the story.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Stryper is back and No More Hell To Pay is an instant classic.  This CD is full of songs that have a harder edge from the most recent Stryper releases.  The songs have a very different feel and tonality throughout the entire track list.  When I saw the track listing I had a feeling that Sympathy and Renewed would be slower ballads, but the CD never lets up and every song is very heavy.  The only exception is a song written for Michael's Sweets wife called &#34;The One&#34; which goes back to a ballad, but not one similar to the past with piano.  Although slower, it is all guitar and has a tremendous sound.  Here is the set list:<br /><br />01. Revelation<br />02. No More Hell To Pay<br />03. Saved By Love<br />04. Jesus Is Just Alright<br />05. The One<br />06. Legacy<br />07. Marching Into Battle<br />08. Te Amo<br />09. Sticks & Stones<br />10. Water Into Wine<br />11. Sympathy<br />12. Renewed<br /><br />There have been some tremendous releases this year - Bon Jovi - What About Now, Scott Stapp - Proof Of Life, and now Stryper - No More Hell To Pay.  Highly recommended.  Tim pumps out the bass and Robert crushes the drums, Michel is singing with as much passion and a possible, and Oz continues to let loose some awesome riffs.  It is very difficult to compare this CD to past releases.  I harkens back to a cross between &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34; and Against The Law&#34;; however, it is more edgy.  One of the most celebrated 80 heavy rockers is back and they sound amazing.  Get this one. MAD
B000SW2F6M|5.0|An excellent Action film with a good Story during the Crusades from the Point of view of a Young man going to the holy land for redemption.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, can't wait till they add more services and expand the list of OS which can work with it.
B008CP6RWU|2.0|I watched my friend play this game. I think it gave me some type of disorder, possibly narcolepsy or some unknown new disease which immediately causes you to drift off to sleep randomly, because after watching him play Flower for about 30 mins I have never been the same. The \\"game\\" was very beautiful however I felt as if I was watching someone tool around with a screensaver or some sort of tech demo. If you are looking for something that is pretty to look at but there are no actual enemies to fight or anything engaging going on I recommend Flower. My friend also told me I had no business trashing a game I have not actually played and that I needed to play it to review it. However, the fact that this review exists rebukes that statement and proves it false. I gave it a 2 star rating because 2 stars is labeled \\"I don't like it\\" by Amazon. I can't really rate it 1 star because 1 star is labeled \\"I hate it\\". I do not feel passionate about it enough to say I hate it, however evidently I care more about the narcolepsy the \\"game\\" has inflicted upon me than my friend who loves this screensaver/interactive load screen disguised as a game loves it as I have now written a review and he has not. I found THIS to be a much more engrossing game...<br />[[ASIN:B0047E0EII Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer]]
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I must say, this movie is extremely boring.  There is hardly any dialogue.  The bad guy was laughable and basically played into every cliche there is.  Never really presented his motivation other than the usual &#34;left for dead&#34; garbage.  The usual &#34;easily escapable situation&#34;.  The usual &#34;Just kill him already&#34; on both the good and the bad guys part.  The usual &#34;I'm crazy&#34; blah blah.  The usual one liners that try too hard &#34;Hate to waste a view&#34; after our hero shot, &#34;I always hated this place&#34; before blowing up home etc...  Really bad.  Absurd.  Boring.  Fell asleep watching it.  Took 3 tries and finally made it all the way through only to regret it.  Waste of time.  Disappointing, especially after so many people sing its praises as one of the best bond movies ever.  Pish Tosh.
B00354YA2M|5.0|I bought this because I lent my hardcopy to someone and can't remember who and never got it back! I've re-read all of Bill Bryson's books several times and wouldn't be without them. They're my go-to books when I want something interesting and light to read that will be informative but give me a few belly laughs as well.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Such a classic album.  I've seen Carole King and James Taylor in concert twice in the past couple of years as well as the new Broadway musical &#34;Beautiful&#34;, Carole King's story.  This album is a flashback to a simpler time and place.  Highly recommended.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|For the last few days the app force closes everyone I try to visit my neighbors. I can't complete certain objectives as a result. Would be five stars if not for the bug.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|It's a fun game but when I try to send gifts it has an error and it logs my off. Is frustrating. Please<br /> fix
B005SZAEYO|3.0|This show was recommended to me by many people over the course of a couple years. I kind of avoided looking into it until recently when I was looking into seeing a new show. I have to say, I am certainly not shocked or bothered by sexuality, gore or violence on tv, but the first few episodes of this show bothered me a bit. I felt a lot of the stuff shown was more for shock value than actual storyline. But I stuck with it and I have to say that I started to really enjoy it. I do think that it is genuinely creepy and I enjoyed some of the character development with the ghosts. I will say, a lot of the negative reviews on this show are from people who are either against homosexuality or just simply claim that this show is filth. I think these reviews should be disregarded unless you're close minded. Aside from that, I will warn anyone that if cinematic depictions of the list below bother you, you should probably pass on this one:<br /><br />Strong sexuality (sex, rape, bdsm elements, masturbation, mild nudity (both male and female)<br />Violence (school shooting, murder, extreme gore, mutilated bodies)<br />Strong language (use your imagination)<br />Depression and suicidal behavior (cutting, suicide)<br />Infanticide<br />Abortion<br /><br />Otherwise, queue it and enjoy it. This show certainly isn't for the fainthearted, but if you are a fan of the twisted and creepy you'll certainly get a kick out of this show.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The only real con - Is knowing that Piper didn't really have the full prison experience. She's white, educated, pretty, has the money for good legal reps, and a very large support group out of prison. She herself points out many times how blessed she was compared to others. She said minimum, short-term Fed prison was \\"awful\\". But for the vast majority it's long-term HE'LL passed down to generations....I also wonder how different life is for longtime and death row inmates, men vs. Women's experiences, minimum vs. Maximum. And very violent, sometimes mentally disturbed mixed in with nonviolent transgressors.
0802473156|5.0|Every person on the planet should read this book. It would save millions of marriages, relationships, and friendships! I learned a lot about myself.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is neat.  It works just great even if the lid on the kindle is shut it will still go off at the alarm set.  Neat :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. King is one of my favorite authors. This lets you know what happened to Danny after The Shing. I read it in two days. I just couldn't put it down. If you love horror , buy this book!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Still going strong after 2 years.  I love this little sucker and I use it daily. If you are a music lover, get a nice set of headphones and start with this little amp here.  You won't go back, I promise.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have been reading this book at night before I go to sleep. Mistake. I lose an extra half hour's sleep or more. Written from two sides of the story, I can't put it down. I'm almost finished and when I am I will look up another book by this author. Really different. Very funny laugh out loud. The twists and turns are not predictable. Fun read!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it works great, I use it for work all the time I am about to get my boss into it and the tutorial videos will help a lot.
B009X010RU|2.0|I had one just like it for my Kindle Fire first generation and I loved it.  However, the one for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; is loose and pops off the corners all the time.  The one for the first generation was tight and snug and did not just pop off when you were using it.  You had to work a little to get it off.
B0015DRPJU|4.0|I have grown attached to some of these characters and things are changing quickly for Rose &Lissa. Some changes are good and some are heart breaking. This book draws you in and further explains the bonds held between the two girls.
B006M3JVD6|4.0|This was very eye-opening.  It gave more of an insight into the physcological state of Jaycee more then the physical situation.  It is incredible how the human mind adapts to accept such horrific circumstances.  I hope Jaycee and her family find peace and justice.
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|I originally bought the Croc Mercy work clogs for work because I stand on my feet all day.  They were comfortable, but had no vents so my feet would sweat all day.  These shoes were all I had hoped for in the Mercys and sooooo much more.  It's like walking around on a cloud all day!  The vents are perfect.  They let air in, but I haven't had any trouble with water get in.  The non-skid bottoms are just that.  I walk on all type of slick, and sometimes wet, surfaces and have yet to slip in them.  I'm extremely pleased with these shoes, and am saying them after wearing them for months.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Learning about AA from Dan Torrance was enlightening. Add SK's thrilling transcendent  writing and I could not put the book ( iPad) down.
0761169253|5.0|This book is fabulous. Every artist should read it. Inspiring, relieving, and straight forward. Loved it and highly recommend it.
B00F91FRTO|3.0|The movie is entertaining.  Unfortunately, it does not stick very closely to actual events.  I thought I was watching something that was more or less a recreation of events.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this app just a little extra with the layout of the game but it don't affect the game its actually cool
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is classic and so well done.  Acting is superb and one feels like one is right there on the scene.  Love the history too and the authentic capture of life in those times.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Thrilling, intriguing, suspenseful, romantic. A Victorian story that could easily translated into contemporary Times. I enjoyed it thoroughly. A must read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first I could not buy it but I begged my mom for it and saw all of the reports and bam I got pocket and pc!!!!!I love MOJANG!!!!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|The movie kept you engaged. It really showed how addiction can make you do things you know are wrong and until you hit your bottom no one can really help you.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Everything you hope for.  Excellent performances from beginning to end.  Even a couple of mini Shadows concerts within the show!
B00ADQPB50|2.0|A real big letdown compared to the first year of American Horror Story. There was a LOT of pumped up ratings I wish I had not paid attention to.
0062064304|5.0|Really great concepts and graphic design elements. All various art from the film is here.<br />You get landscape concepts to alien concepts as well as vehicle and weapon concepts. Such<br />a great book even down to the insignia from the various military/militia groups.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first book was the best. The second book was good, also. I haven't finished this book, yet, but it isn't like I feel bad about putting it down. It's dragging- lacking the excitement of the first two books.
1926778103|5.0|Its Joe MAD - stop reading this and put it in your cart and hit purchase button. Its a must for any comic book fans and of<br />course fans of Joe Mad
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book takes the reader between present day and the past.  The ending is a bit predictable, but the book is a good light read.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I'm a huge 007 fan  and a huge Daniel Craig fan (what a lucky woman you are, Rachel Weisz!) and this one did not disappoint. The theme song sung by Adele didn't hurt, either. Adding even more to the brand was the introduction of Javier Bardem. Although the blonde hair seemed a little gratuitous, he added class to the typical psychotic villain. It bummed me out that Dench had to die at the end, though. She's so phenomenal! All in all, what you'd expect from 007.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I loved playing this on my phone and was excited to see it for the kindle..make doctor visits much easier.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|best book I have read in a long time<br />very emotional and sweet<br />easy to read<br />holds interest<br />well written
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a tough read. Interesting story but it took work to follow the name changes and plot twists. With that said,  I would do it again. Grisham is still one of the best story tellers in the world.
0930289234|5.0|One of the better graphic novels I have read. This collection of the entire story is well done and definitely enjoyable. Far superior to the movie it inspired.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I like that it showed the love that two friends had.<br />I dislike that Lenny had to ruin had to ruin the entire dream that they wanted
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Can't go wrong with Grisham!  Loved the setting and the suspense.  Good all around legal thriller as you would expect.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|After Sean Connery,  didn't think anyone else could be as good at Bond.  But I changed my mind when I say Daniel Craig as Bond.  This has become my favorite Bond movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|keeps your mind in working order and increases your chances each time you play it.  It is fun and interesting.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Now this was the best book I've read in a very long time.  Kept moving right to the end and then some.  Twists and turns and stays with you.
0802473156|5.0|If you haven't already read this book. BUY IT and read it now :)  LOVE this book and its a MUST read for ALL relationships!
B00FKAA3MA|2.0|This album is full of crappy new pop choruses for the new millennium kids. Not his old school fans. This guy is 40 years old and is still complaining and using offensive language, proving to everybody just how much of a homophobe he is. Em can be so much better than this, there is no songs on here with any real meaning that we know he can pull off. Wheres Dre, Snoop, Obie? Instead we get Rhianna, Skylar Grey and other crappy artists, if you want to call them that.<br />He does still prove to be a great rapper, but he's better than this.<br />Here are some songs worth listening to.<br />I will never get another Em album ever. He's a wash.<br /><br />- So Much Better<br />- So Far<br />- Evil Twin<br />- Legacy<br />- Rap God<br /><br />Here are some Hip-Hop albums you should own instead of Eminems garbage<br /><br />- The Roots, Things Falling Apart<br />- GZA, Liquid Swords<br />- Talib Kweli, Quality<br />- Raekwon, Only Built For Cuban Links<br />- Beastie Boys, Check Your Head<br />- Mos Def, Black On Both Sides<br />- Wu-Tang Clan, Enter The 36 Chambers<br />- Hell Razah, Heaven Razah
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made and we are grateful that it has been made on DVD. If you have not seen this, you must :0)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved &#34; A Time to Kill&#34; and this takes place three years after, so I already know the characters.  It's like hearing from old friends. It is a lesson in how the legal system works, warts and all, but Grisham makes it interesting and human.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This performance is amazing. The cinematography impressive. Our children are professional singers and actors  and directors and we all just love this dvd. This 25th anniversary Albert Hall performance is the best :0)
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Wait for the next model.  What they don't tell you is that in order to get a smooth viewing, without delays and stoppage, you must play a movie that has the right format for streaming directly from your router to chromecast.  It says that it works better with a dual band router.  However, they fail to tell you that your computer must be dual band ready or that will not work.  I could not find a dual band computer anywhere online so I am wondering that is that anyway?  I think I will stick with my HDMI cables for a little longer.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very thought provoking and interesting.  Building and occupying space with a finite amount of items.  Learning how to manage through tasks.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was very interesting. I think there . Is magic in the secret garden and it is working miracles on Colin. My friends would love this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I did like the story. It was a little confusing to me at first. I did think the ending was a little sad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy to see and candies are big enough to easily move around.  Glad it's finally available for the Kindle.  Thanks.
0782008364|5.0|I think this is one of the best lesbian movies out there.  Great story, good acting, satisfying romance.  It's not so in your face that you can't watch it with your straight friends and the mob story is good enough to keep their interest.  So many great lines, too.<br /><br />Violet:  &#34;I'm not apologizing for what I did.  I'm apologizing for what I didn't do.&#34;
B00E00OGE2|5.0|First off I am a huge Disney fan and watch every single movie they have or ever will produce. Second...I hated monstrous university, it wasn't for kids. This tiny little movie called turbo...came through with flying colors! It's got heart and makes the smallest dreamer in you come alive. It makes you think anyone can achieve anything they dream. That's what Disney usually is all about. I really thought I was watching a Disney movie but it's made by DreamWorks. Don't get me wrong...I love DreamWorks movies too..but I always thought Disney and Pixar had the heart and soul of every movie they make. This movie reminded me of a little bit of bugs life mixed in with cars. It's touching and funny at the same time. I highly recommend this film for the young and the old. Monsters university is only for adults. Monsters Inc. Was for the young and the old just like turbo!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is just another great book by this author. He is one of the best. Has never had a bad book. All late exciting so that you can't put them down!
B0087ITBPC|5.0|i thoroughly enjoyed this charming film.  babs is wonderful in it, and she and seth have great mother/son chemistry!  I can't wait to watch it again!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Another movie I love Every time it comes on TV I try to watch it. However, my wife has had enough of it so I bought the movie. Now I can watch it whenever I want (in another room of course). Good cast and I really enjoy it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|OH - THAT VOICE! I love listening to this cd and am so pleased Barbra released these songs.  This is a terrific cd!
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Another movie that I've always loved but rarely got to see on TV. Two of the best actors in Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Excellent movie with an awesome cast. I can watch it now over and over when nothing but crappy TV is on.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This musical is by far the best musical ever written for content, musicality and performance.  Whenever I need to be motivated to get out of my comfort zone, I listen to this musical and remember that life is short.  Make the most of the time you have.
1250037751|5.0|What a fun contrast between old paper books and the new electronic books. And I couldn't figure out the ending--I always love it when that happens!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This app is very addictive.  I like the squirl and his nut that keep running across the screen.  There should be a way that you can earn nuts better.  I have been playing this game for a while and I like yge fact that I didn't have to start over like some apps.
1582701709|5.0|This is something everyone should read!  It will change your life, and the way you may have been thinking. I have believed in the theory of this book my entire life. The book puts it all into reality.
1564148793|4.0|It's a guide that gives some good ideas on how to protect yourself from spiritual attack brought on by a malicious person who wishes you harm...and takes it a step further, for those interested, by explaining how to send those intentions back to them. I saw this book as a bit on the occult side, but not in a particularly harmful way.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|A classic cartoon, beautifully made and remastered with love in high definition video and in 3D. Watched both the standard HD version and the 3D version, as well as all the extras, and was fully satisfied with the quality of this new Disney product. Highly recommend it to all the fans of Disney in general and of the 1980s-1990s Disney work in particular.
0441013597|3.0|Tried to get into it upon recommendation from one of my co-workers, and just couldn't. It was slow to start and maybe that was the problem for me. I've heard it is a terrific sci-fi story, though, and one of these days I am going to try and sit down to make myself read thru it...
1781162646|5.0|Still reading it, but a nice read so far. You get pulled into the story almost immediately and then you can go at your own pace.
0802473156|5.0|This book has revolutionized how I approach and perceive human relationships. It explains that each of us have a primary &#34;love language,&#34; then what the languages are, and has a quiz to determine what yours and your partner's languages are. This book teaches that the key to peace, harmony, and happiness within a relationship is the couple learning to show love by both parties &#34;speaking&#34; their respective partner's &#34;love language.&#34; Every troubled relationship could benefit from both parties applying the concepts in this book...and every already-healthy relationship can become stronger by doing the same.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever.  Keeps me challenged and it's fun.  Keeps me coming back for more.  Never boring and never get tired of it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a dreamlike movie that will capture your imagination. Tim Burton has outdone himself. Excellent quality...really nice storyline. Brings me to tears almost every time I watch it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun and appropriate for small children I would recommend you buying this app. love it so much.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|High interest level throughout.<br />Great magic effects and a storyline that does not quit.<br />Good for everyone in the family
B00DVZ414C|1.0|The Cohen Brothers, T Bone Burnett and what do you get a poor Dylan interpretation?  I certainly hope the movie makes up for the non descript music.  This should never have been issued as a sound track, as a matter of fact it should have never been issued, period
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This game is just simply amazing. I really like that this game teaches them to recognize things by the shadow or silhouette not just by actually seeing the item. I also like all the different puzzles and the illustrations. Fun-Filled education.This app helps them to practice with their letters. This game is really helpful when you have a toddler who needs something fun and interactive to help them learn.It has really helped my little one with memorization skills!!!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Can't stop playing this album.  Once it grabs your attention; it won't let go.  Continum was/ is great, but John Mayer has grown.  If you wanna keep up, you gotta grow as well.  I can only tell you what I devour.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun and highly addictive. I am so glad they made it available for the kindle fire tablets.
B002XXUWMI|4.0|This was a good sci-fi, mystery thriller. The sense of isolation and claustrophobia are well conveyed. Rufus Sewell is fantastic in this; Kiefer Sutherland- not so much.
B00181MHQU|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: Retelling of Romeo and Juliet and at the end you see tony dying for the redemption of the 2 gangs. They supposedly will change from their wicked paths after seeing Maria's greif. There's definitely a connection between this story and the history of Jesus dying for the world. It's beautiful and as cheesy and old as this movie is, it's still a classic. I'm 22 and I'm suggesting everyone see this movie (yes you can make fun of the cheesiness).
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Rise of the Guardian is an excellent family movie that our whole family loved.  I hadn't heard much about it and rented it on a whim. Definitely a movie to own!
B004LROUNG|4.0|It was a great read.....I hate to say it becauses I'm such a huge Grisham fan but the books are starting to sound like others and almost predictable.
B002MFWLXK|5.0|Great. A classic. Have seen the movie several times. Love the balls of the story telling and the hyper editing.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read juggling hfcjkbdfv hfcjkbdfv bob in gg hj hj kik kik dc bob dd Jon gg had NBC fc
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging and fun, also sometimes frustrating. This home offers fun for all ages.  It also forces me to put it down .
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game to play.... better than the one on facebook!!!!! I play this everyday all day.. glad I have this game.. you'll love it to... have fun
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to play with lots of options. Challenging but still find it fun. I like the hint button for the Times I am completely stuck.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another fascinating look behind the magnolia trees and moss of the southern United States, to reveal how yhings really were and, still, in most cases, are. A fascinating book by Mr. Grisham told as only he can tell do. You won't be disappointed,
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|I thought it was a very interesting story.  It was not the story I thought it would be.  It had a suprise ending to me.  I was very shocked how intricate the internet scam was.  It was so involved, I was amazed.  I know it happens, and I actually am in an internet relationship, so I was interested in Nev's story.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not even close to the level of the first two books which I LOVED. Unfortunately, the entire book fell short not to mention the incredibly wrong decision to kill off our leading lady.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The story is well told, and maintains a high level of suspense; the ending is quite a surprise. The writing style is what keeps it from being a five-star rating.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This collection is pure enjoyment. These episodes still hold up after 45 years! That's how long it's been since the first Columbo TV film aired, 2/20/68, \\"Prescription Murder.\\"  I had forgotten how many episodes have not been rerun that frequently on TV back in the day. It's a hoot to see a young Blythe Danner, Lee Grant, John Cassavetes, Anjanette Comer, Robert Vaughn, Martin Sheen in lead roles; and Katie Sagal, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ed Begley, Jr., & Jack Riley in small bit parts! The picture quality and sound are great, and NO commercials!  It is interesting to see the early efforts of Steven Spielberg and Steven Bochco. I am so happy to have caught this deal!
0385743564|5.0|Mr. Sanderson never fails to deliver an impressive story, and his foray into the superhero genre is no different. Even if you aren't a fan of &#34;superhero&#34; novels, I can almost guarantee that you won't be able to put this book down. Then you will say, &#34;Maybe these superhero books aren't bad,&#34; and you will download some more random books in the genre, and then you will realize that Sanderson is just awesome and could write about knitting and make it seem exciting.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I'll  always love Gaga and her sheer artistic album she be making! The album is absolute fabulous and for this price!? It can't be beat
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|First things first: I am not a little monster. In fact, I gracefully ignored the presence of Lady Gaga till ''Born This Way'' album. This is not only because I am allergic toward majority of today's pop acts (and believe me, I indeed developed a serious case of allergies for meaningless computerized pop crap over the years) but mainly because I am more of an indie-alternative music follower and I like to remain that way (personal choices need to be respected, right?). However, coming from this relatively more ''objective'' standpoint, I gotta say that I loved ''Born This Way'' as an album. It was dark, lyrically subtle (at least for the most part of it), diverse in music genres, bold, and underappreciated. Simply put, it had everything you would ask for in a decent music album which automatically qualifies it as one of the best pop albums of this decade. ''Artpop'' may not have any of the aforementioned components that make ''Born This Way'' irresistable but strangely, it plays as an equally solid pop record.<br /><br />There are at least 3 reasons why ''Artpop'' easily stands out in the world of pop music diarrhea. First, Artpop is a cohesive album and yet it provides unique moments. These moments may not directly correspond to the variety of ''Born This Way'' but they work beautifully. ''Jewels N'Drugs'' is a hardcore hiphop track which sounds more like a song that features Gaga rather than the other way around. But it is catchy and bold. ''Dope'', arguably the best track on the album, is emotional and simple and it serves as a great break from electronic synths some of us may desperately need. ''Artpop'', which is devoid of Gaga's loud persona, is hypnotizing and remarkable (and thus will not satiate many of the little monsters). And in the midst of them all, ''Manicure'' salutes those who appreciate late 70s-early 80s rock (Joan Jett, anyone?). I don't even need to re-iterate the beauty of ''Do What You Want'' and its 90s r'n'b throwback. The funny thing about the album (and possibly the smartest thing) is that all of these tracks work well together, let it be intentional or unintentional. In this respect, ''Artpop'' corrects the major flaw of ''Born This Way'' by taming the intense variety of the former and making itself sound less rushed and distracting. Second, ''Artpop'' embraces both the best moments of ''Born This Way'' and the pre-Born era that put Gaga on the pedastals. ''Gypsy'' sounds similar to the ultimate-Gaga hit ''The Edge of Glory'' (minus the sax) and yet it is distinct. ''G.U.Y.'' definitely pays its respect to ''Lovegame'' but it features more surprising shifts in its production. Third, ''Artpop'' does not rely on the lengthy-track formula that made some songs on ''Born This Way'' more prone to be skipped. In fact, I have a hard time to skip any track on ''Artpop'' despite my lack of liking of ''Donatella'' and ''Mary Jane Holland''.<br /><br />One might wonder why my review reflects four stars rather than five if I have plethora of compliments in store. Well, ''Artpop'' has two major flaws. First, most songs on the album lack subtlety and lyrical-mazeness of ''Born This Way''.Lyrically, Gaga offers rather a simple, straightforward, and dumbed-down album. No, I really don't want to hear if her ass is famous. Second, some of the songs are overproduced. ''Sexx Dreams'' could have been an impeccable song if the chorus didn't include loud electronic synths that completely block Gaga's voice and ''Swine'' would have played even better with no prolonged synths. But other than these two flaws, ''Artpop'' is a decent pop record. It may not be as progressive and genre-breaking as the title postulates but it provides more than what the majority of pop albums can deliver these days (Yes, I am referring to Avril Lavigne!). I might not be a big Gaga fan but I appreciate good pop music. Full stop.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a fun read for an adult too.  It had an unexpected, not so happy ending that made sense with the character development throughout the series.  I am looking forward to the movie version of the first book, Divergent.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are the best books EVER. I have been reading everything I could get my hands on since I was about 4. I love a lot of books... Nothing however can compare to the feeling I get when I read these ones!!!
1250037751|1.0|Bookclub selection,not one of my favorite reads this year. I am sorry about the brevity but I am being honest.
B004NELBPC|5.0|It is a good read. Honest and compelling writing, with a slant toward the middle left, but still honest in its reporting. While its getting  harder and harder to find the truth now a days, the may be one of the last hold outs when comes to fact based reporting. My only hope is that is doesn' t become the next CNN or CBS... it's only a lie if you catch us tabloid.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I love the movie. Its very cute and funny. And I love Chihuahua. And I might get the second and the third one. The movie was<br />very fun and interesting to watch. I in joy it very much. And I think the movie is worth to get if anyone likes Chihuahua. I order<br />this movie of amazon and it came fast.
0316044695|5.0|Great story of heroism and patriotism. Makes me proud to be an American and grateful to all those who fight selflessly for our freedoms.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adversity does not stop for this man but he achieved in spite if it.  Whatever your condition of faith is, this will inspire you.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|There comes a point when going sooooo over the top is just silly .  Daniel Craig  utterly lacks the subtle nuances off self mockery off the original and greatest of 007s, good oil' Sean,  it may be time to put this aged baby to  bed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game love it!!!!<br /><br />Me and my kids absolutely love it.<br /><br />Would recommend to absolutely everyone of all ages GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; in terms of the local, law offices, and the theme which addresses racial relations and the atmosphere of small town deep south. It is a page turner by a great story teller.
B0000024YL|5.0|One word &#34;Awesome&#34;.  Buy it and enjoy some of the best music from the 60's and 70's, you won't be disappointed.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|Not a bad album but a couple songs sound similar to each other. Venus, Artpop, Do what u want, G.U.Y. and Jewels N' Drugs are the standout on Artpop. $5.99 MP3 price is too good to have passed up!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|seriously listened and sang it on the way to work one morning, and it made my whole day awesome. good mood vibes found here.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is fame it has war and blood sugar<br />It is so sick! And I'm addicted and I'll definitely stay awake all night<br /><br />night
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|The picture is captivating and I do like Gary Cooper as a no nonse actor from whom I have already more pictures in house. I certainly can recommend this picture which describes the story of an individual fighting for his views in creating modern buildings.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Oscar material?  No.  But it's darn entertaining!  Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have great chemistry, and it makes for a lot of laughs.  Lot's of stuff blowing up, lot's of action, and let's face it:  Channing Tatum is decent on the eyes.  I thought I'd give this a shot, and hoped I wouldn't hate it.  I ended up really enjoying this :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Riveting story told with gentleness and sadness in wartime Germany. A grieving young girl's desire to have something to remember her dead younger brother inspires her steal her first book: A Gravedigger's Guide. The book tells the story from the point of view of a poor German family trying to eke out a living and find happiness in the simple things of life: music, relationships, learning to read and soccer in the streets.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An interesting perspective on Jesus and his times, and the story is entertainingly told.<br />Yet, there is obvious cheery-picking of information to support Aslan's thesis.  Overall, his argument is provocative but weak.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is addicting yet very relaxed. I like how you can play offline and this doesn't require requests from friends.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have never read a book that had a title so fitting to the story. This was definitely a beautiful disaster. We read to feel something, and boy, did I feel a little bit of everything reading it.<br /><br />This love story is genuinely raw, sexy, aggravating, endearing, and by all means messy and dysfunctional. Travis and Abby are characters that will stick with me, for better or worse. That is the mark of a talented writer.<br /><br />And although I was thoroughly exhausted by the time I finished reading, I can't wait to read the rest of Jamie McGuire's books!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this app for my 5-yr-old grandson and he absolutely loves is. I only had 3 games he could play and this one was his favorite. I wasn't sure how to play it but after being on it only a couple of minutes he showed me how.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is a great movie and I can't wait until the next movie comes out.  Hopefully there will be more hunting in it.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|After reading this book my wife and I immediately adopted the dietary suggestions that the authors recommend.  This was about a year ago.  We both lost weight and have stayed with the 5:2 diet plan.  While this may not be for everyone we find the diet very &#34;do-able&#34;.  Strengths of the book include ease of read, material well organized, and most information is usable.  Weakness is that there are few citations that back up the statements that call for further research/reading.  I did not spend much time with the meal prep portion of the book but still felt it was a worthwhile read.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Seductive game.  It seems easy, but then you find out how long it takes to finish a puzzle.  I was working on one while riding public transport.  I missed my stop AND the next one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Just wow. This is both beautiful and brutal. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this, that my sister told me to read it, and that stories like this are told.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app. For puzzle lovers . Extremely addictive. If you like puzzles you will love this app. Wish there were more free puzzles.
B003B02O3C|2.0|This was an okay read.  Lots of research obviously, but Grisham is getting a bit trite - figured out the ending before I got there.  JBR
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Wow.  I loved this movie.  With all the new diseases popping up and new varieties of bacteria coming out, the story line is presented really well to interlock with our possible future.  Very fast moving. Excellent special effects.  I understand there is a sequel and will be going to see it as soon as it is out.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great story told by a masterful writer. A story of how our world should be about forgiving the past and living with others in the present. Hard to out down.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|After seeing this story on tv, I ordered the book.  What an eye opener!  The conditions are horrific, and his escape certainly unprecedented. Well worth your time.
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|My husband took it out of the box and never used it ! He hated it and I don't know why......<br />This is the worst money I ever spent for him.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This may say Grisham, but it is surely an early writing.  I love his works, but this just was poorly done, and the font was too small.
1400052181|1.0|This book came highly recommended to me by several family members and friends. They all used words like \\"awesome\\" and \\"fascinating\\" to describe the book. I was very excited to start reading it. The book started off really good and then took a hard left. The author repeats the same info over and over again. This book shohld have been hafl the actual page count. After a certain point I found it hard to read. I was really bored with it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|the product works as promised. it's not bulky. it's a lil snug going in but its not too much of an issue. i only wish there was an indicator LED. but i must say im satisfied.

B007T8BYWE|4.0|I downloaded for my daughter and I can't stop playing. I love the logic of it. It is a game I can get lost in.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|A superbly done classic and as scary as they come. I own it, I would buy it again, I enjoyed watching it for the umpteenth time.
1878424319|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!!!  These agreements make sooo much sense!  Easy read.  I will definitely read this book more than once.  I recommend this to anyone at any age!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 Review The Series is like a brook, it takes you here and there. Actors are amazing.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of the greatest television series ever made.  Great premise, great characters, great story development.  Not to mention awesome zombies!  Watch the series from the beginning to truly enjoy it.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Excellent series; very professionally done with what seems to be a reasonably good historical account of a time when only oral stories were passed down.
006202406X|1.0|Reading this book was a total waste of time. I didn't even feel the need to finish the last few chapters of the book.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I expected a bit more.  Maybe movies like Iron man or even the last Batman have set the standards very high.
0395645662|5.0|This product was worth buying especially for High School students . It is very informative. Its contents is easy to read and  comprehend and can be used as an educational tool for learning to improve the child's vocabulary and reading skills. It is well written.  Thumbs up to the Author and also to the Buyer - A must read!
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|A lovely complementary followup to the first film. Great performances, same gentle focus on the intellectual, the intimate, and the fatefulness of two lives.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Watched with my 15 year old daughter and we both loved it. I do not understand why this movie did not receive an award. These are the kind of movies that we should all be watching. Well made, exciting, funny, suspenseful, and a great message that will affect the viewer in a very positive way. I want more.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is a masterful story teller and does his reputation well with Sycamore Road. I have read almost, if not all of his books. I can't say that to me this is his best novel but it's a close second, or maybe third (this guy is good). His description of characters, scenes, locations, etc. are more than discriptive, they say \\"I've been there, done that\\". I always look forward to his next book and have never been disappointed by this gifted writer.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am enjoying it to the fullest...CV was one of my FB favorites.  I like the idea that the quest-givers do more than wandering about.  I can see myself  picking this up whenever I have spare time.
B000002LOE|5.0|Love it! I love Shiny Happy People, it's my favorite. I've wanted to buy it for years and finally did.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Descriptive of the southern scenery and the emotions.  It is difficult for northerners to understand southern attitudes but Grisham brings them to life..
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Great movie, and great music. I hear it in my head all day long, even when I don't have it on. Love it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game, but it is WAY too hard to get the gru coins.  I still like the game, though.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love the book. Great reminders on how to live your best life. Thanks for writing it Pam. Thanks 'up for a chat' for sharing it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book was an easy read, gave lots of information regarding the period and seemed true to life in many areas, sad at times but had a good story line and happy ending.
0345803485|3.0|I am NOT rating this book because I have read it - I have not - and never will.  I bought it for a gift at the suggestion of a lady in a bookstore - not knowing or investigating the contents.  I would NEVER read a book like this and both the person I gifted it too and me were shocked I bought it. ( she told me about the contents).  So - not listening to strangers again, lol!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Christopher McDougall, the author and main persona in his non-fiction story Born to Run, is a top sports writer, who has a simple question on his mind; “How come my foot hurts?” (McDougall 7). After following trail after trail, visiting doctor after doctor, no help is in place for McDougall. Even after visiting what he calls, “the godfather of sport medicine”, there is no way to continue to run with his newfound foot problem. As a journalist, he has written many articles before, and is adventurous in nature, which leads him to his next imaginative spur. After hearing of a tribe known as the Tarahumara, McDougall decides he will go down into the unknown areas of Mexico to track them down. This “invisible” tribe is made up of supposed super humans with the power to run on and on after excessive drinking, just as easily as we would take a short walk sober. After chasing a seemingly ghost like man known as the White Horse, McDougall begins to learn more about this “invisible” tribe, only to have near run ins with drug runners, as well as meeting a young runner who, as told at the very start of chapter two, will die. McDougall finally meets this elusive tribe, only to soon be introduced to their annual one hundred mile race, which he recounts in between chapters. Although McDougall seems to be slightly exaggerated in some of his story telling, for instance, telling a tale of a few days over the length of forty pages, the book keeps the reader interested, and wanting to see the outcomes of the stories he is putting forth with pen in hand. The book is an easy read, and overall, a capturing story, with an understanding that most of the amazing events are true accounts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for a good book series where I could spend my time invested in a likeable story line and memorable characters. The Hunger Game series had great characters but a disappointing ending to their story. I read the reviews for the Silo series and all people could comment about was how quickly they were sucked into the story and couldn't put the book down. I COMPLETELY AGREE! I found myself staying up late and sneaking in pages during my breaks at work. I kept thinking, \\"Just one more chapter.\\" Don't tell my boss! Well done, Mr. Howey!<br /><br />Just get it already. If you've read my comments this far, you know you should. You won't be disappointed. Now, I'm off to buy the next book in the series. See you there!
B00CGNYDIE|1.0|The app will not install on my Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 4.3 (RingPlus - Sprint MVNO). If I wait too long during the install attempt, it actually locks up the device, requiring me to hold down the power button for 10 to shut down. Hopefully, I'll beable to try this game someday, it looks like one I would enjoy. BTW, this is the first Appstore review that I have written. The problem annoyed me that much.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is not the sort of book I typically read, preferring the \\"escape\\" of fantasies. \\"The Book Thief\\" is the exact opposite and has shown me how incredibly difficult it is to read something with the crushing weight of reality through a non-stop flood of tears.  Although it's a work of fiction, it doesn't get more real than Nazi Germany in 1942. I highly recommend this book, but would advise having a box of tissues at hand, especially during the last 15% or so.
B00FHG19T8|5.0|The guy is just great, period. Love the new songs, love his voice, love it all. You won't be disappointed.
1843106698|3.0|I'm sure this is a better resource book than I am able to appreciate, but as a layperson I needed less detailed help and not so many prescriptions, test materials, etc., as a professional psychologist might want.  So most of the book was lost on me.
B000002ITW|5.0|My husband lamented having lost this old tape in the divorce, so I immediately went to Amazon and found it on CD. He's tickled to have it and relive those old songs again. Really great stuff!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I would put this game on level with most of my  favorites. I like hoe easy it is to play. It's got a nice and easy pace.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Yeah, some pop stuff but lots of other great songs and guitar work to make you happy. The guy is so talented.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I had so much fun playing this game -- the graphics and cut scenes were spot on. There was a nice even mix of ho's and mini games. This is a collectors edition so you get two extra bonus chapter's upon completion, and a handy stradegy guide as well.<br /><br />Now, moving on to the glitches. I played the trial -- everything was going great and I decided to unlock the full version.I  had an issue with the first ho scene I encountered after the unlock. There were two items left to find in the scene, no matter how many times I tapped on the two items the game wouldn't register them. I put the game down for a minute, then tried again, it finally worked (crisis averted.) Then I came to the point where you have to put the skull needle in the keyhole to the house. The first two times I tried the screen would freeze up and then stop. The third time was a charm, I was able to accomplish the task and move on. These were minor glitches, but nonetheless a little frustrating.<br /><br />Back to the good -- I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and gameplay (despite the glitches.) The evil demon boy reminded me of Damien from The Omen.  Overall this one was good fun. IMO, it was worth the price ($2.99), for the full game unlock.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The doble point of view became confusing when the character had an identic style of narrative, but I kinda feel the way of ending the story was right, even if is not what one may expect but... so much power in one character...
B001D0DQUC|5.0|So, let's start off by saying that this is a wonderfully charming movie. It follows a day in the life of a carefree teenager, all set in the mid 80s.  This was the first time I had watched the film and getting it through Amazon Instant Video did not hurt my experience at all. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend a little over an hour and a half having a great time!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It is not common to see a family movie in which the main character is a villain. One could think that it is hard to make this concept work, but this movie shows that it does work wonderfully. The story walks the perfect line between making Gru an unlikable character and a sweet one, especially in the first half.<br /><br />There is a very nice blend of humor and feelings. When Gru's path comes across the one of three orphans, the life of the villain, who is fighting for the coveted spot of &#34;World's Greatest Villain&#34;, flips upside down. The cast of characters used in this movie is remarkable. The each have distinct characteristics that provide entertainment, and the minions are absolutely adorable.<br /><br />Steve Carell does a very good job with the voice acting, and we are thoroughly entertained throughout the duration of the film. If you are looking for a family movie that everyone can enjoy equally, you have found it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wished that Tris would live on to create a new life with Four. But as with real life, often the brightness stars burn out too soon.
B00GHJ1S2M|4.0|It doesn't really have a banger like bad romance on it. But it's a solid record. I'm not a big fan of the rap artists chosen one of the songs... But I'm picky when it comes to rap anyway. Totally worth 6 bucks in my opinion. Just make sure you by the appropriate copy when downloading/ I clicked a link to download and it took me from the explicit copy to the clean download! I didn't realize my mistake til I clicked buy. Oh that's what I get for buying at 3-am.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Overall a great read, I picked it up and finished reading in a couple days. I couldn't wait to get home from work to continue reading it. Ms. Jane Austen's talent for portraying feelings through the written word is amazing. Would recommend to an avid reader :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like the game got a new kindle had to download it again nd progress was lost but enjoy the game so happy to make the progress again.v
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  Once you start playing it is hard to stop.  Losing sleep over this game.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|Great read for all,the sketches are expressive and provide comic relief. Easy to finish even with a busy schedule.it was worth every penny.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|While continuing the story, the ending was somewhat disappointing in that it closed without really finishing the battle.  It was constructed in a very unique way and added tension and interest to the plot by using this construct
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Like this game ,on facebook, nice to have it on my kindle...<br />Can play anytime.....it is a fun and frustrating game
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|This is a nice FAOTD. Good combination of logic and colors. Lovely hot air balloon images. No intrusive permissions or ads. Tutorial is well laid out, but the text needs to be larger. Fun for older kids and adults. Puzzles have hints, as well as the options to restart or stop - and your errors are counted.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great read with great ideas !! Would highly recommend to Anyone interested in the Law of Attraction and or prosperity.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|There is no better Study Bible on the market. This has copious footnotes as well as sections on history, doctrine, comparative beliefs of other faiths and many cross references. The translation is a word for word but extremely readable and understandable. You will never need another study Bible after you have this.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|I forgot how much they use my Lord's name in vain.  I seen it before years ago before I was living for the Lord.  I got it because I have a 3D tv now and this is supposed to be a good movie to watch in 3D, but I couldn't get past them saying GD every 15 minutes.  There is only one other curse word in the whole movie, but they say GD repeatedly.  It really takes away from movies when they do this, and alienates a large number of people don't like to hear it.  Had to throw it away.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Great movie and fun for all ages.  I usually don't watch all my kids movies but this one is an exception!
B00B4804KS|5.0|This was always a fun movie, and now it's just great.  Turn off the lights, crank up the surround sound, and watch the whole scene where the T-Rex comes out of his cage!  YEEEEE HAAAAAA!  They did a wonderful job converting this movie to 3D!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I found this game challenging, but not overly hard. Where I got stuck,I used the hint key. I highly recommend this game, very interesting and fun.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Very cool story.  I enjoyed it very much.<br />Could have done without Tom Cruise taking my Lord's name in vain, twice.  It really takes away from the movie and does nothing for the story.  Ever since he's been in scientology, he seems to make it a point to say that in every movie.<br />Otherwise, I like the story and the movie was put together real well, I stayed intrigued the whole time!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Great read,very heart warming. Told over several generations in a war torn country in the Middle East. Would defiantly recommend this book!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I love this movie.  Mostly because it is so fun in 3D.  Some movies are just made in 3D, and others are meant to be seen in 3D.  This is the latter.  They do things throughout the movie that are meant to mess with you if you're watching in 3D.  Alot of fun to watch with the family.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|Just didn't have the Bond, James Bond feel.  Not clever, I was never sitting on the edge of my seat or wondering what will happen next.
B000059ZT4|5.0|Because the music is soooo good. The packaging and handling was perfectly fine, product as expected, t´all worked out fine.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love my Headset!<br /><br />Great range<br />Very comfortable on my head (no headaches after hours of gameplay)<br />Decent battery life (A full days worth on a full charge)<br />Great audio sound (cant tell that it is 7.1 cuz its so close to my ear)<br />G buttons on headset help with audio profiles that i have<br />Love the feature of automatic mute when mic is on the upper position
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Again a marvelled captivating read..Lee child never disappoints when it comes to reacher. Can't wait to read more. Highly recommended
B000SW2F80|5.0|I just loved the comic book treatment of this program. It takes me back to the very early fiftys when I was quite young and impressionable.  I know t least a few of us well remember when Charles Atlas sold his theory of Dynamic Tention to build better bodies in the leaves of your comic book between stories. I don't think they ever sold Voodoo dolls.  Maby they did. It was nice to see well known TV and movie actors play the lead rolls.  I didn't know E. G. Marshall &#34;The Defender&#34; ever cussed.  Of course it's always good to have Steven King play one on his parts.  Good show.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is wonderful. I have sped through it, as I find myself wanting to know what happens to the characters. I am looking forward to the next two installments.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray version. I sat last night and watched this concert. To me, it started a little slow or &#34;off&#34;, but once they got warmed up - YES!! The sound quality and the mix are excellent. Their were a few times where James Labrie's voice was &#34;scratchy&#34; and this could have been a microphone issue, and it was amplified on my sound system. I was just sitting here thinking - what if I had never heard &#34;Take The Time&#34; on the radio in 1994? I would have lost so much musical enjoyment and inspiration from this band and all of the bands I have discovered since this band. If you like a variety of music types that span over 20 years from the best band on the planet than I would say this is worth the money even for the basic disc.
0452289963|5.0|a hidden gem, and highly appreciated book due to the powerful message inside, helps you to rethink things and reflect always
B0083Z614S|5.0|I think the way Frances Hodgson Burnett put this together was amazing. I loved every single page. I would recommend this book for all ages.
1450419895|4.0|Very nice illustrations and very easy to follow instructions. Helped me a lot to become physically fit. the only strength training book you need.<br /><br />EDIT: Highly recommended if you also buy the Strength Training Anatomy book so that you can learn the basics and make this book more useful, this will equip you with better knowledge about strength training and physical fitness.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|This was an AMAZING show, and the folks that cancelled it should have been SHOT!!! Thanks for letting us keep the memories!
0736092269|5.0|very informative book due to the good illustration and the lay-out also, made me appreciate strength training more and inspire me to develop a healthy lifestyle.
B000J103OI|5.0|One of the BEST movies EVER!!! The screenplay is PURE genius, the performances are perfect, they don't make them this smart anymore - and that's a SHAME.
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|very nice story, nice plot and very good drama to keep you entertained, its a dark film with a lot of lessons.
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|Every girl young and old should watch this movie and laugh in the face of those using the term &#34;weaker sex&#34;
B002QNTNL6|5.0|one of her last good movies before she turned crazy looking.... It is a feel good movie and my daughter loves it too..
0811879542|5.0|Just love it.  Interactive reading that is simple, fun, colorful, active, but NOT from an ipad.  I first saw this book when my 2 yr old's preschool teacher read it to her class and they really enjoyed it.  I now own it and it just makes me and my kids smile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great for quick breaks , am having a difficult time getting connected with Facebook but it could be operator error hehe.  Hope you all enjoy the game!
0316228583|4.0|Several people that I know were complaining about this book, so I had to read it to see what the hoopla was about. I read the book and listened to it on Playaway. I have never read Harry Potter, therefore I really didn't have any particular expectation about Rowling's writing style. I expected the writing to be decent and when it exceeded that expectation, I was glad. I enjoyed the layers that each character had, and the fact that I could clearly visualize each character as a full fledged individual and not a cardboard cutout.<br /><br />Also, even though the setting and dialect/colloquial terms are completely different from where I live, I found myself being reminded of situations and people that I have met. I found myself thinking upon the different experiences that I have had as a teen, and comparing those to what is in the book. I think I almost cried when Rowling described Sukhvinder's situation. Yes, it wasn't the worst, but her story struck a cord with me.<br /><br />And, there are multiple perspectives to choose from when reading this book.I usually find myself having to flip back and forth through the pages to figure out who the heck is being referenced. With this book, however, it was pretty easy for me to keep up with everyone. I think the only shortcoming that I saw was that everyone in the book seemed to be miserable and very few grew from their experiences. But, that's life.<br /><br />All in all, this was a really good read that I would definitely recommend.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Awesome story...love how she kept the momentum going through all the books.  You fall in love with the characters and need to know what comes next.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister. We went to do see The Dark Knight Rises right after she gave birth, so to have the whole set held special meaning to her because it helped her get through some pretty rough days.
B00ET2ODTE|3.0|The general quality of the acting and cinematography is fair to middlin', nothing spectacular. Nevertheless, Juno Temple, Sharon Stone, and Robert Patrick all give notable performances as, respectively, Linda's buddy and her cold, distant, puritanical parents. LOVELACE captures the atmosphere of the '70s pretty decently. The story's broken up, and some of the time-lapses are quite jarring. Still, the flashbacks allow for some elements of surprise, at least if you're not familiar with the details of Linda's life (as I wasn't).<br /><br />LOVELACE's single best aspect is its portrayal of the porno film industry and how the exploitation often goes much deeper than simply pressuring gullible people into being filmed doing things they loathe doing. The end of the film is what really redeems it. There are, of course, many sides to any story: Some will like the stance LOVELACE takes while others inevitably won't. The makers of this film went a bit too far in portraying Linda Boreman/Lovelace as a completely innocent girl-next-door who just happened to fall in with the wrong guy and his crowd, but I can see how that was hard to avoid.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter, there is very little graphic sex/nudity, and it was obviously wise to avoid making an admonitory bio-drama about a porn star into a porno film in its own right.
0765367351|5.0|I didn't know there was a Bioshock novel until a year after its publication while browsing Amazon. At first, I checked the book out from the library and quickly discovered that this would not do. I got 60 pages in before I set the book down and just ordered from Amazon. It came few days later, and I finished it within a 48-hour period. I was actually really bummed when I got to the last few pages.<br /><br />The book is a prequel to games. It talks about Andrew Ryan, how he came to be, and how Rapture began. I really enjoyed how Shirley fleshed out the characters. One can see how hopeful and excited everyone was about the idea of Rapture. Also, one gets to see the awe that is inspired in the people who actually get to go to Rapture. However, one can also see that there were problems with Ryan's plans from the very inception of Rapture. Ryan takes note, and like many people, pushes it off til tomorrow and/or ignores it. If one is familiar with the games, s/he knows things start to go wrong...or completely right, if one is to strictly interpret objectivism and its views on capitalism.<br /><br />Anyway, I think the best thing about this book is the fact that a reader can start reading the novel with no idea about the games and still enjoy him/herself.
1439181780|5.0|Book arrived quickly and in great condition.  It is a very inspiring book to read.  I highly recommend it for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Very addictive game but, it gets pretty boring after a while. It doesn't seem to matter how much skill you use it just comes down to the luck of how the candy falls. It will leave you stuck on the same level for days and days.  Just the same ole same ole. I'm giving it three stars for the addictive part.
1781162646|4.0|Nice, old fashioned Stephen King, more slow paced, not such a long read, lovely.  I especially enjoyed the setting of the beach carnival life from yesteryear.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I like the movie.  It had a lot of action, a lot of that comic knock-back that you would expect from someone as powerful as these guys.  I liked how they brought in the super senses and how disorienting they would be until under control.  Also the laser eyes.  Very cool with the bit of &#34;build up&#34; before burning forth.  I have a few minor beefs, with no disrespect to the actor Mr. Fishburne (personally I like Laurence Fishburne as an actor, he was great in the Matrix movies, and a real pain in the butt in the Predators Movie!) , but Perry White is a white man, also the suit was ok, although it could have been a little brighter in color.  I did not like the new idea of Krypton, as it felt to &#34;Avatarish&#34; to me, they could have done so much more with the crystalline world and the lifeforms that co-existed with the Krytonians.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This is a good wholesome movie. It is nice that Disney still puts out movies like this. I am not one for musicals, but my step-daughter loves it and knows all the songs by heart. We even brought the movie to grandmas, and she enjoyed it too!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|To see John Carter(Thomas Dekker) as a kid or young man was a very good approach to this franchise. In my opinion he was a troubled genius.  Like most of them are. Leana Headey and Summer Glau were fantastic. The constant barrage of  terminators and the concept of time travel and paradoxes kept this show interesting.. What a toll it took on the writers and staff to constantly come up with  materials every week. But what fun too.!! I would highly recommend this show to any us who are  interested in computers and/or our computer generated world.<br /><br />mcw
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.<br /><br />I don't know why people are so upset with the fact that this movie turns ponies into people. Definitely a good movie, and worth watching. We can't wait to see more of Equestria Girls (if they continue in that direction).
031623480X|5.0|Whether you are trying to heal your body or just want to avoid disease in the future... this book is an excellent read.  Dr Perlmutter is a brilliant doctor that I personally visited in Florida. He wants to get the word out to everyone about the dangers of gluten and grains whether you are gluten intolerant or not. Gluten and grains can be contributing to anything from migraines to autoimmune diseases. He also talks about what a poor diet the low fat diet is  and the fact that the body needs some good fats. If you want to enjoy a good quality life then do not delay reading this book.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|I have a brand new Voyager Legend and one of the earlier Voyager Pro's...this case is about the size of a pocket watch and is horribly open (in design) on one side. Not only can you not snug the headset into this thing in any secured way; but you especially can't close the case lid which folds over from the back. Wish they made a case for Plantronics but this isn't it, trust me.
B00CRGZMUI|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two books. This one was completely disappointing. It felt like a cash-in on the popularity of the previous books.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It's a great story overall but the book is difficult to wade through at times..Hugo quite frequently went off on little ideological tangents. I read these parts in 'fast forward' in order to get back to the story.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Definitely one of my Top Ten of all time.  One of Daniel<br />Day Lewis' best performances.
145210655X|5.0|THE STORY IS GREAT!<br />THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK IS EXCELLENT!<br />IT IS A GOOD GIFT FOR ADULTS OR KIDS!
0307454541|5.0|One of the best novels of its time. Frightening, fast paced with amazing characters at every turn. It's almost impossible to put this book down once one starts to read it.  More twists and turns than a pretzel factory!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO THE PLOT. PEOPLE JUST SHOW UP AT PLACES WITH NO INFO ON HOW THEY GOT THERE OR HOW THEY KNEW THAT'S WHERE THEY NEEDED TO BE, DID ANYONE READ THIS SCRIPT OR WAS THERE EVEN ONE WRITTEN. THE ONLY ACTOR THAT READ THIS SCRIPT MUST HAVE BEEN TATUM - AND HE ASKED THEM TO KILL HIM OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BRUCE MUST HAVE BEEN SMOKING CRACK AND DWAYNE MUST HAVE NEEDED THE MONEY.<br />  I REALLY LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE AND I THOUGHT IT GOT A BAD RAP. SO THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO RENT THIS. WHY A MOVIE STUDIO WOULD WANT TO TRY TO MAKE A MOVIE FRANCHISE BY STARTING OFF WITH ALL NEW ACTORS IS BEYOND ME. I CAN'T PICTURE THERE BEING A 3RD ONE BUT IF THERE IS I HOPE SOMEONE WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE SCRIPT AND  AT LEAST GIVE THE ACTORS SOMETHING TO WORK WITH.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This movie will set chills down your spine at almost every turn.  You are all wondering if they meet their maker you don't want to know.  A gruesome tale of how are creators now sought out to destroy us.  They see us as an experiment gone horribly wrong.  If you like the aliens series you'll love this movie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is definately a page turner. Rather short but Gaiman's world is very distinctive and full of lovely discriptions. Two thumbs up!
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|Looks like a fun game, but for those of us that are colorblind some of the colored gems are hard to distinguish.  I can't even start to solve the first easy puzzle.  I wish there was a symbol mode that could be set instead.  :-(
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Note: This is a product specific review for the 6-disc Blu-ray Ultimate Collectors Edition released in September of 2013.<br /><br />===============================================================<br /><br />If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the movies and you love the series. And, sadly, chances are you probably already own one, two, or all three movies on DVD/Blu-ray and you're thinking if you want to double dip on this ultimate collectors eddition. Hopefully this review can help you make tha decision!<br /><br />First off, let me go over the contents:<br />- There are 6 Blu-ray Discs, the contents of the first 5 discs are 100% identical to the previously released versions, but the print is redesigned to fit the art in the hardcover book where the discs sit (kind of like the Bond 50 set). the 6th disc has new contents.<br />  1) Batman Begins Disc<br />  2) Dark Knight Movie Disc<br />  3) Dark Knight Bonus Features Disc<br />  4) Dark Knight Rises Movie Disc<br />  5) Dark Knight Rises Bonus Feature Disc<br />  6) Ultimate Trilogy Bonus Feature Disc<br />- a 48-page picture book, pretty awesome!<br />- 3 standard hot-wheels sized replicas of the bat mobile, the bat pod, and the bat. they're small but relatively high quality (like all hot wheels cars)<br />- a set of 5 villains cards, the size are the about the same size as the box itself.<br />- a letter from Christopher Nolan (pretty lame with not much added value IMHO)<br /><br />The next section I will focus the review on the content of the 6th disc that is never before released.<br /><br />The new bonus disc has 3 special features, a documentary (about 90 minutes), a featurette, and the IMAX sequences from the Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Now while most people will think the IMAX footage included here is pointless, this is actually the feature that made me decide to double dip on this set, this is why:<br /><br />The IMAX sequences presented here are in its original 1.44:1 IMAX aspectratio, and they simply look awesome! It is letterboxed to fit the screen (black bars on left and right) but if you have a projector or a big enough screen, sit a little closer to your screen and it will blow you away! I played it on my 1080p projector's 120\\" screen, with the 1.44:1 IMAX aspect ratio, the screen turns out to be about 100\\" or a little less. but after moving my seat forward a little, it's just amazing! over 100 minutes of IMAX goodness! Still haven't finished it yet but I just love love love it!! This is my new demo disc!<br /><br />A few little complaints tho,<br /><br />1) This is my major complaint: They still left out a few IMAX shots from both movies, generally the 3-to-5-second second-unit shots they use in between scenes. I'm particularly unhappy about missing the Hong Kong day scene when Fox's helicopter lands on the helipad, and the sea plane landing shot. Those are among the most beautiful shots in \\"The Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />2) When they intertwine normal 2.35:1 and IMAX 1.44:1 shots, the 2.35:1 shots expand to the sides of you 16:9 Blu-ray frame (the \\"normal\\" look) and the 1.44:1 shots has black bars on the left and right sides. so in a sense, you're neither getting constant height NOR constant width! I'd like to see a constant width presentation, but this is just a minor complaint<br /><br />Overall, the collector items and this disc made double dipping worthwhile IMHO
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I think it's a shame that so many people who loved this trilogy are giving Allegiant such terrible reviews simply because they wish it was ended differently. This was a fantastic finish to a thrilling series. I applaud Veronica for her amazing talent! My heart was ripped out of my chest and beaten to a pulp (I cried for about a week straight) but I'm left feeling overall satisfied. Divergent is and will continue to be one of my all time favorites!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It is probably more for women than men.  This would be a great book club book.  Lots of areas for discussion.
B0007152JG|4.0|Enjoyable book especially if you like people with depth. There is a real charmer in this one. My fellow reader was also impressed. will  look for more of her books.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Ok game for a free app.The clues are a bit of a ripoff. $15 for one letter(usually given in the easiest word of the solution) is ridiculous. Would be some improvement if the more difficult puzzles paid out more $ . An ok game for a little brain exercise.
0596009208|5.0|As a former Architect who learnt code (self-taught) first as a hobby and now as a job, I think this is one of the best books there is to understand not just about Java, but about computer programming principles. There are of course in-deep knowledge you won't get from Head First Java, but it makes an excellent job of putting down the basics so you can start coding your \\"own stuff\\"<br /><br />Remember coding is a craft, theory only goes so long. Getting your hands dirty is what makes you a good programmer, Head First Java is great at explaining the Why? and What? of Java so you can stop copying gist and start make your own stuff.
0553801503|5.0|A strong entry in the series. The TV series is good but Martin's command of language and attention to character development make the books a wonderful reading experience.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child have never disappointed me. They always exceed my expectations, and leave me wanting to keep turning the pages well after the book is finished.<br />White Fire brings back Corrie Swanson, the captivating and sometimes careless young lady we first met in Still life with Crows. While she has grown into a focused young student of criminal justice, she retains the shoot from the hip antics that make readers hearts skip a few beats.<br />Our man Pendergast is back after the devastating loss of his beloved wife, Helen. Corrie manages to inadvertently drag him from the deep chasm of despair he has been floundering in. What can I say, Pendergast is our man. I don't want to slip with any spoilers, so I won't elaborate on the plot line.<br />If you are an ardent fan, you probably know already how quickly the book will grab you and not let you go. If you're new to Preston and Child, congratulations ! you have started on a grand adventure. I would suggest reading the books chronologically. Enjoy, I know I have.<br />Long live Agent Pendergast!<br />P.S. I finished this one in about 36 hours, don't make any other plans.
B00FAT9W0A|4.0|I love Keane. One of my favorite bands, but I must point out some glaring omissions from this CD. This is why it gets only 4 stars. My favorite song from &#34;Under the Iron Sea&#34;...&#34;The Frog Prince&#34; didn't make the cut. Two great songs from Perfect Symmetry omitted....&#34;The Lovers are Losing&#34; and &#34;Black Burning Heart&#34;. A great song from &#34;Strangeland&#34;.....&#34;The Starting Line&#34; omitted. And one of my faves from &#34;Hopes and Fears&#34;......&#34;Can't Stop Now&#34; omitted. I would have omitted &#34;Hamburg Song&#34;, &#34;Try Again&#34;, &#34;My Shadow&#34;, &#34;Spiralling&#34; and &#34;Bedshaped&#34; to include the ones I listed.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Super fast shipping. Product is a little different than the one in the main picture. Actual figure is the one with the textured darker blue suit in the package. A very cool collectors action figure. Quality with a good price you just can't beat. I recommend it to anyone trying to collect or for someone getting it for their kids.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady gaga is the best..I listen to the album over and over in my car and I bought I digital copy as well!!<br />She is the queen.. Sorry Madonna time to leave gaga alone because she isnt going anywhere
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great story line... Lots of adventure... Happy and sad.  It held my interest throughout the whole book.  I need to refresh up on Constance Green in his other books....
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was a great book very well written and has a great ending that most people would never guess.read it now
B00ET7EON4|4.0|I love this entire cd. They are the bomb.com...so creative and each song has texture to the tracks and not plain.. can't stop dancing and I'm at work...awesome. worth the buy.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|The most great thing about this book was its truthfulness. I, at some point or another, have felt like Cath,struggling to catch up, and have some kind of fun along the way. When I look back on Fangirl, I see so much of myself in the main character, and I never err wanted it to end. In fact, I ended up reading the acknowledgements in the hopes that there was more of an insight to what happened after, if only a brief sentence about each character. This book put me through so many shifts in emotions, mostly \\"I ship them, but I ship them too fml\\" and tableflipping. Lots. But don't let that steer you away, because this was an amazing book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a big fan of the Shinning and was afraid I would be let down by a sequel.  But I loved it.  Danny is everything and more that I hoped he would be.  This is a great read.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It's a dictionary of English. Quite helpful in situations where you don't know what a word means. Good dictionary definitions of the English
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I have used MacAfee products for years. This app is great. I have not had any of the problems other reviewers mentioned. It does not slow my system at all. I can only surmise that the other reviewers either incorrectly blamed this oroduct for problems caused by other apps or they don't know how to boost RAM on their android device. I have tried many apps that slowed my android,  especially the apps for toddlers. With a RAM booster, even those apps run faster. This product has never slowed me down. It gives me the same great protection I have come to expect from MacAfee.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app!  it's easy to use and large so I am not hitting other keys. I use it everyday.<br /><br />Thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great read! Stephen King makes you care about the characters in a way that make you feel as you've known them forever. I recommend to anyone who likes a classic tale of good vs. evil!
B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset is overpriced, barely functional, and tarnishes Logitech's brand.<br /><br />I've had this set for a while now. Initial impressions were decent - easy setup, build quality seemed fine (if a little plasticy). I was disappointed by the sound quality, which really surprised me considering all of the other reviews giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />In testing the sound quality, I played a FLAC of some very dynamic music and compared these headphones to another analog pair I plugged into my receiver. The logitech set sounded flat, low bass, and muddy compared to the old (and not so hot) analog cans I used. To make sure it wasn't my computer causing the issue, I ran the same comparison on a laptop and set the logitech headset against the same analog phones plugged into the laptop's audio output. The logitech set's quality was similarly disappointing.<br /><br />Despite the sound quality issues, I probably would have still given the set 3 stars if not for the terrible connectivity problems. Google around for pages mentioning this headset cutting out and you'll see tons of customers who complain that the set loses wireless sync frequently and then takes a few seconds to come back up. There has been no definitive answer from logitech on this, although many people seem to be of the opinion that it is due to congestion on the 2.4ghz wireless channels this headset uses (and is competing with wifi routers for). Unfortunately, there is no way to either display or test which 2.4ghz channel the headset uses, so you're forced to play with what channel your wifi router is on yourself. That is a problem I can deal with through trial and error, but I live in an apartment building where I can see 12 or 13 other routers. Am I supposed to ask all my neighbors to change their wireless channels too?<br /><br />Finally, the battery life on this headset leaves something to be desired. My last pair of wireless headphones were by Creative, and although their build quality was much worse, they were cheaper, sounded better, had a more reliable wireless connection, and had batteries that lasted much longer., they were cheaper, sounded better, had a more reliable wireless connection, and had batteries that lasted much longer.
B008M7JODC|3.0|Great series over all, but it doesn't pick up until mid way season one and then takes off in season two.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The novel makes interesting extrapolations of social networking trends. Some, such as the decision by the near-monopoly of the title to require full-name identification to cut down on trolling, seem good ideas. Also the use of &#34;frowns&#34; as well as &#34;smiles.&#34; But The Circle goes too far, intruding into the lives of billions of people. And the main character, Mae Holland, is implausible. She becomes an almost unquestioning tool of the company (she does have moments when she feels a &#34;tear&#34; inside herself) and is oblivious that her attempts to do good often result in disaster. She comes to recognize her appetite for power, but she never understands the buried streak of anarchy in herself.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|One of his better solo releases. The idea is mulitple producers worked out well. Wish all the bonus tracks were on 1 CD
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Everything you could expect in a Backgammon app, but I got frustrated with the AI's ridiculous &#34;luck&#34;. If you're a backgammon expert, or even just a very good player, you will too
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This holds up my laptop perfectly and is very sturdy. I know without a doubt that it won't break anytime soon.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|If You Would Like To Watch A Foreign Film With American Actors (and all the subtitles you can Handle)? Then Buy It. I Still Have The Receipts In My Pocket From The Theater I Went To See This In. If They Would've Told Me INCLUDES HALF MOVIE IN SUBTITLES . .  I Would've Past. I Cannot Torment Myself Again So I Will Not Be Purchasing This Movie EVER ( Sorry Jodie & Matt ) You Sold Out To MEXICO
B009JBZH54|5.0|Quality is great and I love that I have the entire collection in my personal library.  This is one of the best collections ever.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever!!!! Never liked zombie type shows or movies but decided to try this a month ago because all of my Facebook friends were raving about it and was completely hooked by the 2nd episode!! Now in season 3 within 1 month. SO good!!! Love Rick & Darryl!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this was one of my favorites.  Would recommend to anyone, even if they haven't read his other books.
6305692572|3.0|Movie is GREAT BUT THE DVD CASE  WAS BROKEN WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED AS USUALLY DVDS ARE SHRINK WRAPPED TO CARDBOARD. THIS WAS COMPLETELY LOOSE IN THE PACKAGE
006202406X|1.0|My problems with this book relate mostly to how it was written. There are a lot of things that could have been done with this third installment considering that cliff-hanger in Insurgent. Yet the book was boring, without really anything happening until the last few chapters. Even then, it was very anti-climactic. As many reviewers have already mentioned, I also didn't like the way it ended. But that's up to the author to decide and we as readers can't choose it. But, as the author, I think there is a certain responsibility to make the books consistent with others in the series and make for an interesting read. I felt her style changed and it was a chore to get through the book. After about 150 pages I remember texting a friend and saying \\"does this ever pick up?\\". I was very excited to read Allegiant since I devoured Divergent and Insurgent in a few hours. Then in Allegiant it just got so boring and frankly, depressing.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|I have a few sound cards and mixers all wired into eachother. I was getting AWUL hum from ground loops, and so bought 5 of these to throw inbetween every single connection.<br /><br />The hum is GONE!!! The audio signal is the quietest I've ever heard, at +50db its a slight hiss in the background, NO HUM ANYMORE. Unfortunately now my mixer shocks me, and when it does sometimes my monitor on my computer turns off briefly... so instead of hum now I get buildup of charge on my mixer and get zapped. So if you are going to use these to get rid of ground loops, you still need to have a good ground on your equipment. I unplugged my TV out of my computer and the zapping stopped, but the point is if you are going to use these you have to be aware of every single electronic plugged into your system and make sure they are all grounded very well. Otherwise the hum will be gone, but you'll still fry your electronics. Sadly I live in an apartment building so my grounds are limited.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|who doesn't love star trek?  I gladly paid for this and i was so happy when it showed up at me door. I sat down and watched them all in as close to a straight shot as i could get.
0345529057|5.0|A gift for our son.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I love the movie, its great. I love Tom Hardy and his role is great, just an overall fantastic movie, i should have gotten it sooner.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm reading this book right now and so far, so good. I'm interested in reading the whole series and then watching all the movies so hopefully they'll all be this good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fgf never shuts Snyder.brazen oven hawk levy guide black land and I start to stab him to death. All you peeps suck at math.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm totally upset that the author killed the main character. I know she has a right to write how she sees fit but seriously wasn't expecting that. I was looking forward to the movies but don't think I'll invest my time on those now.
1891252089|5.0|This is a great book for instructions on the Ashtanga sequences A, B & C<br /><br />the spiral bounding makes easy flipping and handling during practice.<br /><br />A must have for the beginner
B008EKOO46|4.0|One of the reasons I read is to come into contact as best as possible with as broad  a range of the human experience as I can.  So, when wandering between the stacks of my city's library the World Until Yesterday caught the corner of my eye, I looked at it and was interested.  Diamond  opens the book describing his thoughts in the airport at Port Moresby as he observed today's New Guineans, most of whom were born into or are at most a generation or two removed from neolithic material conditions. Reading the prologue in bed, I looked at my wife and said, &#34;This is going to be a good book.&#34;<br /><br />And it is very good, especially in the first half.  The idea of the book is to compare the behaviors of people in Neolithic material circumstances with our modern, western ways, with the normative goal of drawing lessons for us to improve our lives.  Diamond is not a romanticist- he is very clear that modern societies offer advantages in food security, in peaceful social relations, medical care and so on.  Still, that does not mean that we haven't lost something in trading traditional for modern ways.  Diamond is interested ina  path to taking the best from both worlds.<br /><br />Along the way, he melds together detail about the lives of neolithic people from the anthropological literature with some incredibly interesting experiences from his own friendships and experiences with New Guineans, as they lived the traditional lives of their ancestors and as they adopted a modern, western lifestyle.  This approach holds true especially for the chapters on child rearing, treatment of the elderly, risk taking and warfare, and it's utterly fascinating.  Do you want to learn about, and emathze with people who are about as far from your experience as you can imagine?  Then these chapters are for you, and they're the first three quarters of the book!<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me at least, the final chapters to focus on the impact of modern social and especially materialconditions on our physiology.  That is already familiar to most of us.  For example, is it any surprise to learn that diabetes is related to obesity?  And that obesity is derived from the relationship between a physiology evolved in a context of food scarcity and a social environment of food abundance?  During these final chapters there is very little to do with traditional cultures, which is what excited me so much on page one.<br /><br />Anyways, this objection is a matter of my preference and even these chapters are written with clarity and by a supple mind.  You might find them to be the most interesting part of the book.  I learned a great deal about a completely different human experience, and if that's what you're after as well, I heartily recommend The World Until yesterday.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|obviously i am happy with this artist. i dont know why people have bad reviews about it.. if you don't like her music thats your choice and shouldnt waste your money buying it. if you like her music you will love the whole cd. :)
B000FC0P9E|5.0|This is the remarkable story of a little nine year old city girl who gets lost after wondering off the path in the woods in Maine and how she struggles for survival through the ruggedness of the remote reaches of Maine and New Hampshire both physically and through her terrifying imaginings.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game it is great you should by it it is totally worth being around in this world. It is such a cool  game. I am happy the kindle  fire is around.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|excellent book, enjoyed reading, was a required reading when I was in school but never took the time back then
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Such a good read! I shall take this to my death bed and even read it in the after life!
B009WUBERW|2.0|Typical Arnold corny movie. Effects are ok, acting weak, Chuck Norris needs to stay retired. Arnold as well, just ok.
0307271080|5.0|It is a fabulous book and every African kid who is thinking even for a moment of coming to the US should read it.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Reality. Depicted very well, a lot of truth and great effects. If anyone wants to know what this war was truly like, watch this movie.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The Signature of All Things has left me speechless. Gilbert is a masterful storyteller who drew me into the tight life of Alma Whittaker from birth 'til death and felt I was unfolding with her. A third person narrative where your heart will expand and break and be reborn. Incredibly satisfying on many levels. Well done Ms. Gilbert.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|the song in the video is catchy and its very funny if you like funny apps download now its amazing I haven't played it yet but I think I'm gonna love it its hilarious
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I found this book so ridiculous that I was depressed that it was selling well. While I like the &#34;Big Brother&#34; idea of technology taking over the future, these situations and characters were unbelievable. I'm sorry I wasted money on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, addicting, but stressful waiting for more lives. I wish the lives were unlimited and also not so user friendly if you don't have facebook.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Great movie about a man that I never knew and enjoyed finding out about his life.  Great cast and directing
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Having read several of Gladwell's books...and while this was ok, it was not my favorite. The first part of the book was much more interesting and seemed much more focused on the topic than the last half. All in all, a good read, but I definitely prefer BLINK or TIPPING POINT.
006202406X|3.0|To start with, I was reading Tolstoy's War and Peace as well as The Great Gatsby concurrently with Allegiant. So Allegiant probably didn't have a great chance, although that isn't the case with all Y.A. literature. Roth has a good story idea but its execution was dissatisfying. Of course, I recommend it to anyone who read the first two books in the series; you've got to have this third novel for completion.<br /><br />I read the first two books (Divergent and Insurgent) and enjoyed them more than this one. I found the ultra-simple language downright annoying, almost condescending, but every so often Roth would have some insight into characters that was much more perceptive and nuanced.<br /><br />The ending was OK -- I can see that many fans will have huge issues with it and rate the book based on the plot's outcome -- but I read this book very quickly, more to get through it and get back to my real reading than anything else. As for the ending, it might be the best part about the book -- there are some themes that show depth only hinted at in the rest of the book.<br /><br />I feel bad about disliking this book so much, because I liked the first two and want to be supportive of this author. But it's hard for a book like this not to be an annoying gnat in the shadow of Tolstoy and Fitzgerald. I did take into account the genre and expected audience, which is why I gave it three stars; it's a quick read, but sort of like watching General Hospital right after The Cain Mutiny.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Since I had almost 500 invites to play candy crush I thought I would give it a go....to my surprise I was hooked with in seconds... now all I can s as y is why did it take me so long to play it

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A good one. The man can spin a good yarn. I'm really not in to court room brawls, but ..with history it makes the case so much more realistic. I give him an A and suggest he find another feud from the past he can tangle into. I'm from across the river in Louisiana and could give him gobs of material to write about.
B00F2362IE|2.0|My 4 1/2 year loves TMNT and was so excited to purchase this game with his own money. He likes playing it... when it works. It takes a long time to load and freezes up every time. I've had trouble getting my Kindle Fire to restart sometimes because of the game issues. It would be really nice if this could be fixed since we've already spent the money on it.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Simply awesome music, played live (on this album) better then many studio-recording ever recorded....<br />Guitar music as never played before....<br />This album gave me the best versions I ever heard of several songs!<br />David Gilmour's music is simply amazing, still and again!

B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|A brilliantly funny and touching book - well worth the wait! Bridget is as authentic and lovably real as ever. Great job Helen Fielding !!!
080701429X|5.0|This is an excellent book, one that might even change your outlook on life. I found it well written and very profound. I would recommend it to everyone, in particular to those interested in the subject of life's meaning.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|The book was ok, but really didn't get thrilling until the end. I found it hard to associate with the characters...
B003SI605K|5.0|This is a great movie about the mother/daughter relationship. It shows how misunderstandings and assumptions can play into the view each have of the other.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game but I finished all 440 levels on my kindle.  Can you make an update so I can continue to play?

B000URWYTS|5.0|Somehow, Mamah took ahold of my soul and wouldn't let go.  Her struggle so long ago mirrors what I often see in divorces today, especially those involving children.  I have a deeper understanding of something I could never comprehend.  Leaving ones
B009YU62H2|5.0|Thanks to soungarden, at age 55 I still can't grow up ! I blame them for this ! Great album with heavy guitar and blues riffs ! Very talented group.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Love this movie, it never gets old.  My 36 year old watched in high school, my 30 year old watched when he was in high school, and my 19 year old watched it just recently.  Everyone enjoyed it.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This was decent enough for me to buy the pro version. Got sick of the ads. It pretty much serves the purpose I needed it for: note taking and note organizing!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read and at points believed that I was,there in person. I can see this as a blockbuster movie, written for the cast of A Time To Kill.... Another very good book, Mr. Grisham. Another very good book...
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie. Funny, exciting, good acting. Would watch again. Wife liked too. Sound was a little wierd, FX very high, found ourselves turning it down, and then back up to hear the dialog, so we didn't wake the kids up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Starts out like any match 3 game, but after about level 20 it mixes it up and gets a lot more fun than the others in this game genre. And no, you do not have to pay to keep going! I am into three digits in terms of level and have never purchased anything. But prepare to be persistent instead. Use your brain, not your wallet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this is a nice romantice realistic show, I truely love watching it.. it was such a simplier time.. beautiful county
1250038820|5.0|Beautiful portraits and stories that show the humanity of the everyday people one passes on the street in New York. Every person has a story.  Brandon Stanton is a poet and a storyteller who pays homage to the beautiful and complex lives of New Yorkers.

B0098VXHBG|2.0|There is nothing really memorable about this movie, and the storyline is weak.  Juliette Binoche's acting was the most positive part of the movie.
0393320928|5.0|This book is divided into two parts. The first is autobiographical and insightful. The second involves Feynman's experience in his role as a member of the presidential commission for the investigation of the space shuttle Challenger disaster. In completely non-partisan terms he reveals why government is not the solution but that large unaccountable bureaucracies are the problem.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was disappointed by the functionally. It only provides. Plugins for netflix and hulu.  I was expecting to be able to stream local,content to my tv using chromecast.<br /><br />Basically a waste of money for what it can do. Google needs to open it up to third party developers
0547391005|5.0|It's a big book that will be treasured and has all the stories I read to my children years ago.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A heart warming and lovely story. What child wouldn't revel in having their own secret area, with additional secrets to go with it?
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is a real page turner.  I loved Pillars of the Earth and this is just as good.  I recommend this book

B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book had me in tears by the end. It captures the vulnerability of teenage romance in very realistic and heart-breaking way without being twee.

B008602KQI|4.0|Surprisingly interesting plot. Dumb look at future. It's like a modern Running Man with a small love story thrown in
B00632HWOG|3.0|I don't know what the problem is but it will not update my inbox on either my phone or my fire. Useless. Can only check my mail from my laptop.  Revised rating, as the app seems to work now to see mail. If I delete a message in the app, it is not actually deleted. It's there when I go into mail from laptop.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|this was one of my christmas list items that i was able to find at a reduced price, and is worth watching and owning the series
B00DJZR4A2|1.0|I didn't receive the Poster, the CD came in the lousy cardboard case rather then the Jewel case and the Album was not very good.  I'm very disappointed in this album Elton!
B00138KE5Y|4.0|Barbara at her best, having fun singing with others.  I can't imagine it was fun to coordinate with all these other artists, but the album shows quality and the best of all the participants.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoyed playing Bejeweled but was tired of the same matching strategies game after game. Candy Crush gives you level after level of challenges &amp; makes you crazy trying to beat them. I always wonder what challenge the next level has in store for me!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|this is definitely a fun game. it really passes the time and get get very very addicting. I would recommend this game to anyone especially those who enjoyed minecraft
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well cast and acted, compelling stories, multiple story lines in each episode, and all family friendly.  A lovely way to spend an evening or two or more.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This  is a very thorough, well researched and written book . Dr.Davis, provides logical and historical reasons for is hypothesis of the &#34;Wheat Belly&#34;.  The book is not a short read but worth the time.  For those who are impatient and want to get started on a non-wheat diet take a peek at Appendix B. I consider this a real health book that could be helpful to people of all shapes and sizes. This book provide enough info to help you establish &#34;core foods&#34; for your individualized diet. One negative comment - please, add a title name at the beginning of each chapter. This may seem minor but it’s a big deal  when reading the electronic version.  I  also would like to have seen more recipes added.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Absolutely well-done. My kids and I loved it so much, we watched it two more times within 48 hours. Clever writing and interesting story-telling leading up to the Monster's Inc. story.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I didn't like the back and forth on the 1st person narrative. The subsequent death of the main char was horrible and did nothing to promote the ending of this series in a manner consistent with the first 2 books.
030758836X|5.0|Great book, had a few twists and surprises along the way.  I am not a book expert, but it was an easy read and it was hard to put down.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books. I was very disappointed in the third book. It was hard to get into and had a horrible ending.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge of the Orgasm is not just erotic poetry, it is an experience. This book lets the reader FEEL. They say the mind is the largest, most powerful sexual organ in the human body, and this book definitely proves it. The words wash over the reader, pulling one in deeper, creating a delicious vortex that definitely keeps one wanting more!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Kept me entertained through and through. A mysterious novel with compelling friendships and emotions. Dashner hit home with this one.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Good read and lots of common sense.  I think they may be on to something there. They really have some good ideas and it is really not hard to follow.  I really like some of the recipes also.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.  I wish the daily tokens were a bit more because it is so addicting, LOL.  I have a couple of other bingo apps but this is my favorite one.  Also, there are tons of rooms and options with slots!  Great game.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Cute little game. Not too much pressure to spend money. A little aggravating having to wait for lives so I just re play previous levels to pass the time.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a really good program I use it all the time everyone should have this program you will enjoy it
B007BFSYMS|5.0|this  is one of the best apps. i love the combo sound of the cat purring, brown noise and fire crackling. its got to be my favorite sound mix to lull me to sleep. im used to having a fan on all year but sometimes in new england it can be too cold for one so this app did it for me. i even like the vacuum sound as when we were children my mom used to vacuum when she would put us all down for our naps, so to this day (when someone other than myself) vacuums its a comfort secure sound. there are many mixes you can experiment with the paid app. try it out, you'll love it. you can even use it to lull your child to sleep to.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I absolutely love this device! before purchasing this I use to use my PS3 for streaming purposes. Unfortunately, my 6 sear old console got the yellow light of death; rendering my streaming capabilities to nothing. So instead of spending the $90 to fix my PS3, i bough this instead to use until the PS4 released.<br /><br />Shipping was quick, received it within three day, included easy to understand instructions and was not hard to set up. Simply plug it in to a (HDMI) plug in on your tv and connect the (USB) cord into your TV if you have one ,which you should if you have a fairly new TV.<br /><br />Works great with Netflix and YouTube from my Smart Phone and Lap Top<br /><br />WIFI is required but honestly, who doesn't have that these days lol<br /><br />Hope this helped!
B0083Z614S|1.0|Well it as weird when I was reading it cause I really didn't understand it at the end so I thought it was weird
B00B2OSZIW|4.0|Love it on my camera.  I never thought to use the camera without it.  Good fit and no issue to remove for battery and memory card.  It is a bit pricey though. The balance and grip I get though make it worth it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like this app. I use it nightly. the new sounds you can download free are a great bonus.  love that it was a free app but would pay if needed.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I manage many passwords across many devices. Lastpass is worth the $12 per year for the mobile device support. Took me a bit to get used to the improved version 3 products, but still happy!
B004LROMWU|5.0|At 1st, I thought Falling Skies was just the same copy from another Sci-Fi show - - how I was mistaken.  The story flows without hesitation or without going who, who, what, what.  It is great to see how people come together and see what separates species.  I have truly enjoyed watching this series and I hope it continues more than for a couple episodes.  Noah Wyle has truly surprised me in this acting role.  I thought it would be hard to get over seeing him as an ER doctor, but you do not even remember him in that role.
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|A fairly good action adventure film. The two old timers do a good job. It's refreshing not to have the every other &#34;f&#34; word syndrome of today's films.
B008OJ2994|5.0|Yes, I was alive and well when the original Blue Sky came out, however this album is absolutely fantastic.  I watched a documentary featuring Jeff Lynne and was absolutely blown away with what he has done for every single song.  I truly had no idea what was done to the songs then and now.  I pulled out my original album and compared the two and enjoyed both of them in different ways.  I truly would recommend this new one since there are more tools available these days to let you hear every single tick of the record.  Old groups are still the best.
075669812X|5.0|Excellent book.<br />Love legos.  Even though I am an adult.<br />I still enjoy legos.<br />And lately legos have become so much more popular that all these cartoons started appearing.<br />I love the fact that my son loves Legos too.<br />So we both enjoy all these story's that Lego people have created it for Lego lovers.<br />This is an awesome book for someone who follows this story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A fun way to pass the time while in between classes or at the doctor's office or just anywhere, anytime.  Only been playing it for a few days and I think I'm becoming addicted!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|A fairly decent hidden object game, with a few issues that prevent a full 5 stars. For example, the habit of the game to show sparkles over objects you can do nothing with until later. Enjoyable story and engaging play, not overly difficult so consistently fun. Easy to take out and play while waiting for appointments and similar.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|What's not to love?  Best season yet!  I love this season from the first episode all the way to the last!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely and positively one of the best games for the Kindle Fire. The graphics are as stunning as the game-play. EXCELLENT story line that keeps you glued to the game and your progress. TOTALLY enjoyable.
B00902AKK4|3.0|Good and challenging game. Docked a couple stars for locking up a couple of times. After a while it can get repetitive which is why took anger star.
044042321X|1.0|Terribly drawn, Poorly written, and painfully slow. The comics themselves have roughly 10 or so pages to them and it takes forever to get through because they are so short and cover so little. Don't even bother with it.
031237593X|4.0|Penman is my favorite historical fiction author.  I trust her to have done her research and make it as accurate as possible and still write a great novel.
0440423228|1.0|What I said about the first book still applies for the second. Poorly drawn and written and painfully slow. It's a waste of time and money and as a die hard Song of Ice and Fire fan, I would not recommend.
1895565669|5.0|A sweet story about the circle of life and the never-ending love between a mother and son. Funny, sweet and sad.
B0085A9HU6|4.0|It was a good but tragic movie, i wish stuff like this could be real sometimes the maybe the world would be getting better not worse
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A little different than I expected but still a great ending. A different twist to a familiar story line<br />I'd read it again.
1250038820|5.0|Love love love it. End of story.<br />Lots of people can take nice portraits. Just as many can take good street photos. Few can put together such good photos with insightful stories like Brandon can.  You don't need to be a New Yorker to find this amazing.
0345529057|5.0|perfect condition, arrived quickly.  i really enjoy reading these books even more than watching the tv show.  Highly recommended buying
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app. is wonderful.  The New World Translations at your fingertips.  App. runs smoothly...there is not jerking.  It will probably be my most used app.  Thanks!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Husband loved this set.  I previously wasn't a huge fan of show, but got really hooked watching the series .  Also, its a good quality set.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Too much special effects that took away from the storyline, which was weak.  Glad I did not rush to the movie theatre to see this movie.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend to add to his extensive movie collection.  I've never seen the movie but he loves it.
B004WR125O|1.0|It just work one time and  never after .  it´s in an abandond box now , I bougth a Linksys adapter and  fix the problem.
B0000013G9|5.0|I had this cassette when I was a teen & loved, loved, loved TLC.  I was pleased to find this CD with all of my favorite TLC songs at such a great price. Brings back teen memories!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This keeps me connected and up to date with what friends are up to and I have connected with some former students
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Product shipped very fast.  Processor is exactly what I bought.  Didn't overclock as high as I was hoping, but not the seller's fault.  This allowed me to alleviate the bottlenecking in my system.  Absolutely love it.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I have only started playing this game but I have enjoyed it. Others have stated it doesn't make sense but the logic in this game is straight forward to me.
B00G32OER4|4.0|This was a great film.  It was super tense, always kept me on the edge of my seat.  A couple of jump-scares, but you could see them coming and prepare yourself if needed.  I admit, they got me a couple of times even so.  Nothing too gruesome, no foul language etc.  But I definitely would not recommend to small children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best though I have struggled a little and I have found diamonds but never been to the nether<br />Minecraft or rocks I can't wait till beta it's awsome
B00G32OER4|4.0|SUPER SCARY!!!! But good story line. CRAZY how its based on a true story. Never been so scared of a movie.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|So good! There were so many actual scares in this movie without it ever being gross or annoying. I wish more horror movies were like this. I jumped several times while watching it. The cast was great and the story was very interesting. I love that Patrick Wilson has been in several fun to watch horror films because I really enjoy him as an actor and Lili Taylor was excellent in this. This movie had me glad my parents didn't have a room full of creepy possessed things in our house while I was growing up. Fun movie to watch as a family.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|My wife and I were lucky enough to attend Def Lep's residency in Las Vegas and were even luckier to draw the date they were filming this DVD by chance. An awesome performance excellently captured in this DVD. We are both longtime fans and were thrilled by the concert. Lep shows why they have stood the test of time and why their music is still relevant today with this show, and best of all their live sound is expertly close to the album (a sign of true musicians). A big plus is that I spotted us not once, but TWICE in the crowd footage - doesn't get any cooler than that. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|All my tunes in no time flat..without having to hunt tor a working (insert YOUR device named fruit here)- with a cable that isn't an issue.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Fantastic packaging.  I didn't buy any of the movies individually, knowing that this would eventually come out, and it is everything that I wanted.  The art cards are gorgeous.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This app is great and I'd recommend it to anyone! It is so fun, you don't all ways have to draw a stick man, you can draw anything! (I drew a cat, LOL). Please, GET THIS APP! It's so awesome and you'll never regret your purchase ( unless you hate good games, which if you do, I hate you)
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Pacific Rim doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.  Giant robot vs. giant monsters from another planet.  It's got a great cast and the tip o' the hat to Japanese monster movies is good fun.  If you want a deep philosophical view of the human condition, look elsewhere.  This is a summer blockbuster at its best!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Really awesome book! If you like the fantasy genre you'll love this book it has action and a love story all rolled up into one package!
B008BM9L72|4.0|It wasn't what I was expecting with all the hype about the book<br />BUT it was good reading. Kept you interested. The best part of the trilogy<br />was the story behind the book now that was very good.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Great read, fascinating book...liked the authors writing..  Would recommend to anyone who loves a great story.  Am going to order another as a gift.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The game is simple, but fun aswell. It's a lot of fun playing it so yeah<br /><br />using the greatest hits in the middle east<br />Yo the greatest hits inside
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I was extremely excited for Man of Steel for many reasons. First of those, the selection of Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El was excellent. Second, the reintroduction of General Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals, as well as the return to Krypton were long overdue (30 plus years) for a Superman series. Third, with the advancement of CGI and in the wake of the stellar Dark Knight trilogy, expectations for a fresh, realistic and awesome Superman were nerdishly and gloriously high.<br /><br />With untamed glee and a pair of 3D glasses, I sank into my movie theater chair and calmed myself for what was to come. (Warning: SPOILERS may appear throughout. So please proceed with caution.)<br /><br />The movie begins in a familiar place: Krypton --- visually striking, chaotic and different in every way than the planet familiar to fans of the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it allows us to see Zod and his companions in their prime, leading a resistance against the council. Jor-El comes to life like never before, thanks to Crowe's presence and skill. While I still prefer the gravitas and authority that Marlon Brando loaned to the role, Russell Crowe brings the character of Jor-El down to Earth (or Krypton, to be exact), instilling a sense of humanity that seems to be (or tries to be) the heart of this film.<br /><br />The movie ensues as expected with the incarceration of Zod and his companions in the Phantom Zone (no longer a whirling sheet of glass, by the way), the sending off of baby Kal-El to Earth, and the destruction of Krypton and all of its inhabitants, with the exception of those trapped in the Phantom Zone, of course.<br /><br />Once on Earth, we encounter some serious problems. Not only does the movie seem to lose its focus, but Zack Snyder makes some creative decisions that have left me somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />First, I wish I could have been a mosquito on the wall when the director, producers and editors decided to turn Kevin Costner's contributions into a series of flashbacks and \\"flash-forwards,\\" as a result, significantly diminishing his emotional impact in the story. Why couldn't they have simply presented the story of Kal-El's developmental years with the Kent family in a linear fashion? Snyder must have been watching The Godfather II while editing this movie, but to no avail. The Godfather II masterfully follows the paths to power of the two main characters of the saga, Michael Corelone and his father Vito Corleone. Both stories offer great substance; powerful antagonists, believable character development and a sense of great depth and history. Man of Steel does not. Man of Steel's editing seems like a last-hour decision to take an average to above-average movie and give it a touch of complexity and introspection. Unfortunately, that is not the result. What we get is a warm, touching performance by Kevin Kostner (Jonathan Kent) broken up into bite-size segments intended to convey significance or document a milestone in the life of Kal-El (Clark). Why not include a few scenes that allow more time for Jonathan and Clark to bond like father and son? Instead, the relationship feels contrived and the film rushed. And when the moment of reckoning for Jonathan Kent arrives, I didn't know whether to laugh (because it was pretty funny to me) or cry because his role ended up being a spoiled opportunity to build the humanity of Superman. And thanks to this awful editing, I can't even tell you how many times I heard the same motivational lines from Costner to his son. The first time was meaningful, the next few renditions made me squirm in my seat.<br /><br />What's extraordinarily awesome is Kal-El/Clark/Superman's (minus the uniform) journey after his father's death. These wilderness years find our hero trying to find his way in the world. First as an oil rig worker and then as a valiant savior who passes through people's lives, leaving behind what the news media begins to report as miracles. The movie should have spent more time in this area, as in Batman Begins, to help develop the character that would become Superman. It would help drive home Clark's fascination with the Daily Planet, where he would eventually hang his hat. Enter Lois Lane, briefly. I can't even begin to comprehend how she's able to sneak around and infiltrate such high-level-security locations. But she does. And it seems convenient to the story, rather than a consequence of her persona.<br /><br />The interpretation of Zod was well done. And for those who are curious, Terence Stamp's Zod this was not. Stamp brought a controlled sense of malice and dread to his character, while Michael Shannon's Zod felt unleashed, overly bitter, hands-on, vengeful, unpredictable and highly dangerous. So that was great, but what about his cohorts? Yeah, I almost forgot they were in the movie too! Richard Lester's and Richard Donner's Superman II featured Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals to perfection. While their mannerisms (don't forget their porn star robes masquerading as uniforms) might seem dated, not-so-villainous, and sometimes campy by today's standards, we had time to get to know their characters. In Man of Steel, Ursa shows signs of a personality, but doesn't get enough screen time to fully develop into a memorable villain. Non, on the other hand, might as well have been an AT-AT from the Star Wars universe. Character development and screen time aside, both Ursa and Non participate in some spectacular combat scenes with Superman. In that regard, Man of Steel eclipses the Lester's and Donner's series without a doubt.<br /><br />To wrap up this list of the good, the bad and the ugly, I was intrigued by the idea of the buried outpost spaceship containing Jor-El's holographic \\"spirit\\" and the Superman suit. It was cleverly done, and fit nicely with scene in which Jonathan Kent tells Clark, \\"You're the answer to 'are we alone in the universe.'\\" What's odd is how Jor-El plays such a vital role in the subsequent key events, considering that he's nothing more than a holographic image, albeit, with a talent for advanced computer programming and a mastery of forecasting that would give a meteorologist in Antarctica a run for his money.<br /><br />Once I was able to ignore those glaring pimples in the plot, not to mention the colossal planet drill that kills countless inhabitants of Metropolis, the rest of the movie was enjoyable and goes down like cherry cough syrup. No longer chained to the hope that this movie would match the quality of Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, the movie plays out like your typical superhero/action/sci-fi epic. And that's what it boils down to: a monster of a movie that had everything it needed to be epic, brought down by poor editing and missed opportunities to give us a modern Superman that we could all care about and, at the very least, remember. My review hasn't said much about the character of Superman, or the acting of Henry Cavill, for that matter, for good reason. It's just not memorable.<br /><br />There's talk of Ben Afleck suiting up as the new Batman to star in a forthcoming Superman sequel, and it's become apparent to me why Man of Steel is kind of a let down. Much like how both Iron Man sequels seem to exist merely to accentuate The Avengers super-moves, so does Man of Steel feel like a prerequisite for the long-awaited Justice League franchise. Was that Snyder's intent? I'm sure he wanted to make a great movie. But he couldn't quite get there.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd recommend Man of Steel to anyone, particularly those who enjoy a good action or sci-fi film over an in-depth, slow-building, emotionally-charged action/adventure, such as the one that I was hoping for. If you're a comic book purist, I'm sure you'll already have strong opinions about this movie. If you're a fan of the Lester/Donner series, then you'll either walk away feeling nostalgic or,at worst, mildly impressed. Luckily for me, I was both nostalgic and mildly impressed.universe.'\\" What's odd is how Jor-El plays such a vital role in the subsequent key events, considering that he's nothing more than a holographic image, albeit, with a talent for advanced computer programming and a mastery of forecasting that would give a meteorologist in Antarctica a run for his money.<br /><br />Once I was able to ignore those glaring pimples in the plot, not to mention the colossal planet drill that kills countless inhabitants of Metropolis, the rest of the movie was enjoyable and goes down like cherry cough syrup.

B008K9SG9K|4.0|I LOVE THE CD TO PIECES!!!  However, the case was cracked due to packaging.  Needs to be packed in a hard box rather than bubble wrap package.  Packaging needs to be better.

B004LPLU4K|3.0|I read this story to my youngest daughter many years ago and wanted to see what the movie was like compared to our readings all those years ago.  I thought the acting was good, especially the children, but the movie storyline was more melodramatic than I remembered.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Throw another log on the fire - saw this amazing play and had to have the soundtrack.  It has been years ago now and I still get a chuckle listening to Popular and get tense listening to Defying Gravity.
B0012GMWCU|4.0|Excellent cd A true and forgotten master of the Chi town blues Would recommend for someone to add to their collection
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Fantastic Writing by Christopher Paolini. I have been enthralled with his writing and he is on his way to competing with the top fantasy writers of the modern age.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Definitely enjoyed the book --- I was always anxious to get to the bottom of the mystery that was the main theme in the book.  Along the way, I met serveral interesting characters and was reminded of the horror the Londoners must have gone through during the constant bombings during World War II.  It also, brought a smile to my face about the family connections we all experience -- blood is thicker than water!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Peter Jackson continues his comprehensive movie background documentaries that he began with Lord of the Rings. I get absorbed in the documentaries at night.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the unusual plot.  I would have given it five stars except for the ending which I didn't like.
8866137634|3.0|I always love Moleskine, but the functionality of Evernote with the notebook does not always work. Now in their defense I do not have the best hand writing, but even with improved handwriting it is very hit and miss.
006202406X|1.0|I want to make this clear...the reason for the low rating is NOT because of the tragic ending, It's because the whole book seemed out of place compared to the first 2 books. Tobias was out of character for most of the book. The love story was flat. The uniqueness of Tris and the other divergent characters was lost in this book entirely (I can't believe the author made it so Tobias was not divergent). All divergence meant was that they were Genetically Pure. So all the build up in the previous 2 books led to one big disappointment.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|absolutely amazing. perfect end to such an amazing series. this series has truly changed my life and it is, as in all great series, a bittersweet goodbye.
B00CGNYDIE|2.0|In the easy level the game is logical with all the colors of adjacent cells  represented but it is too easy so in higher levels more and more of cells do not show tokens for surrounding cells to make it harder.  Unfortunately this action is arbitrary so in progressing, depending on the sequence of cells you choose to reveal, the game progress often get hindered with not enough clues to move forward and you have to make random guesses.<br /><br />This is similar to their other line of games where to compensate for this not so logical contamination they allowed you a few hints and wrong guesses but in this case it is a poorer choice since it take away the logic in the game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is a very easy read, full of tragedy, joy, tears, and wonder at the human spirit. Very well written and hard to put down, though you must, just to take it all in. A reminder of how evil and unfair life can be, but at the same time, how much good there is also in humanity. Should be a required read for all of us.
0061730327|5.0|I feel blessed to have learned of William Kamkwamba.  My eyes have been opened,my mind expanded, and my life enriched from reading William's memoir, &#34;The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope.&#34;
B000M341RI|5.0|This movie is funny, sad and uplifting by turns. It takes the viewer on a touching ride into the lives of several unemployed steel workers who aren't afraid to risk their dignity to keep it.
0345533666|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" makes me think. This excellent mystery caught my attention from the beginning to end. Jacob's father believes that his 14-year-old son is a good boy and even though Jacob may or may not have committed murder, he blindly believes his son is innocent. An intelligent lawyer lost his common sense for his son. Even Jacob's grandfather was willing  to kill someone in order to protect his grand-son. None of these three generations of men seems to understand why killing people is wrong. Did no one teach them? Jacob's mother is much more honest. She is afraid of Jacob's cruelty that reads him to kill people as if they were insects. She feels guilty about raising Jacob to think that. She wants to prevent his wish to kill. If I were Jacob's mother, what I would have done? I understand her action but it makes me sad. Is there any other way?
B000HZD168|5.0|This is a Trek classic that you will go back and watch again and again. The best classic story plots with Khan, Kirk and Spock!
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Finally a hidden object game that's different! You go exploring for a change. It's not the boring hidden object game! Thank you soo much!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really made me think about things, look at life differently, See it through a whole new perspective. Prepare yourself.
034580404X|3.0|This book was not as good as everyone made it seem... out if all three the first one was the best
B00DMK6WN4|4.0|The original Monsters Inc movie was original, and fantastic, and a follow-up is difficult. I really enjoyed watching this movie with my son, but it lacked something (for him) that I have difficulty putting a finger on. At 3 years old, though, I can attribute that 'somthing' to its novelty relative to a film he has seen countless times. For me (and my wife), the college setting was almost nostalgic, and often times the jokes had a simultaneous kid and adult target with different context- a difficult endeavor. Hands down the best addition to film was Charlie Day's character- bringing a sort of &#34;Its Always Sunny in Monsters University&#34; feel. The 3D is fantastic, as to be expected, with more depth-use as is typical of Disney Pixar films.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|i loved the cast in this movie, and all the twist in this movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always guessing on how they did what they did be for you find out from morgan freeman
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Preparing to write this review, I can already picture my son (almost 3 years) cracking up as Guy (Ryan Reynolds) introduces Belt, his pet, cook, conversationalist and navigator, who also holds up his pants....&#34;dah duh daaaaahhhhhhh!&#34; This is a phenomenal film, one of my favorite in the past several years- and I am making this statement across all film genre's rather than limiting to antimated pictures. In brief, the story is a phenomenal tale of the importance of being open-minded and accepting of change, as told through the trials and tribulations of one of the last remaining caveman familes. Disclaimer, I contend that I probably have a tumor sitting on my amygdala, as I am prone to being tearful at most heartfelt movies with a nice musical-score to accompany the climactic moments; and I am probably a therapist's dream patient for dysfunctional family issues. These thoughts in mind- this movie was perfect. The visuals were nothing short of amazing, the 3D is some of the best I have seen (plenty of depth, but also with well implemented pop-out effects that we all claim are gimmicky but secretly love), and the voice actors were phenomenal. I don't say this often, but I actually enjoyed Nicholas Cage in this role (and would welcome him in other animated roles)- his style of overacting(a la The Rock) was perfect for the role. I have thus far only viewed part of the bonus features, but they are enjoyable, and the digital copy works well on my computer and iPad. Its a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.
B00EDG2LWC|2.0|I have read about two thirds of this book, but have decided that life is too short to spend any more time on it.  Rowling is a good writer, but I am tired of the unrelenting depiction of despicable, stupid and degenerate human beings.  The book is not entertaining, nor does it instruct or edify.
147674355X|5.0|Perfect book! Romance, Drama, Angst, Secrets. Everything was in this book. You should read it!! You will not be disappointed!
B0025VLELQ|4.0|As everyone knows, the graphics are dated, but an excellent copy. I can now dispose of my VHS and Beta copies.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! This book is so beautiful written and leaves you thinking about your life. Don’t miss this book!
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Pure science fiction. That's what comes to mind when I think of Blade Runner. Originally overlooked by mainstream audiences on original release, Blade Runner has joined the ranks of classic Sci-fi films.<br /><br />This 30th anniversary Collector's edition Blu-ray features an identical transfer to the 5-disc 2007 Blu-ray release. That is to say the video presentation is nearly flawless.  The supplements are also identical, including the 3 hr and 34 min making of doc Dangerous Days. There is one extra inclusion on the 30th anniversary edition. For this release Warner Bros has included over 1000 stills from the film for your perusal. While this extra feature may not be a reason to upgrade if you already own the 2007 release, it definitely sweetens the deal if you have yet to add this title to your Blu-ray collection.
1400119170|5.0|Super excellent book highly recommended for any student in oncology or practicing oncologist. Straight forward enough even for non medical professionals with interest in oncology history. I bought the unabridged CD version and I thought the narrator did a good job. I spend an hour in my car every day commuting so listened while driving and so it was perfect for me I highly recommend the CD version.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK beware of tear and sadness and feels.  All I will say is hat it is worth it
1611137527|5.0|I really like Gladwell and like his story telling ability. I highly recommend this book. It is not a text book  on psychology but provides thought provoking ideas mostly true in an interesting and captivating story
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It's awesome! Tris and Tobias are such developed, complicated, and amazing characters! Go Veronica Roth! The story line is complex, with a twisting and turning plot. The goal of the duo became completely different than what I thought but in a smooth way, and the ending was bittersweet.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|What's not to LOVE about Il Volo! This is my absolute favorite Christmas cd!!! Il Volo doesn't disappoint!! If you haven't bought this yet- you need to!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|was late in playing this game but love the challenges and addiction that this game can cause. love getting. family to help me pass a level
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and addictive. Load times are slow. And it takes a long time to raise funds to open a room, then when you do, it's blocked with something you need to earn. If you buy your way in with diamonds, it's only for one look then it's blocked again. Frustrating.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's what all the  cool kids are playing, so i played it too. its pretty nice and unique in itself. plus free.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Entertaining with great special effects. Was it ever pointed out what caused the zombi infection? The ending was not as good as it could have been.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I would highly suggest this book to anyone who loves fantasy books. The author creates an amazing story that is filled with magic, shape-shifters, and magical creatures.  This is an awesome YA read that both my teens and I enjoyed.  It holds your attention all the way through.  I found it so hard to put down.  Sheryl Seal is an amazing writer and I love how easily the words flowed.  A great read for all YA and would highly recommend.  Look forward to reading more from this author.  Great job.<br />Sincerely, Karen Brueggeman, author of [[ASIN:B00FPR99QE Children's Book:  Fruzzle's Mystery Talent: A Bed Time Fantasy Story  (Children's book ages 3-10) Bedtime story,Picture book ,Fairy Tale (Kids book collection)]]
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Not just &#34;guy&#34; humor, although there was that too.  Good storyline, cute and funny.
