B001AQT0ZO|5.0|Modernizing an old story can sometimes work but not always (Great Expectations was questionable) but in my opinion Lurhman's worked modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet quite well. The cinematography is magnificent, the actors did quite well (esepcially with such tedious lines), and overall it was a really cool experience. Recommended.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I bought this for my kids ages 6 & 4, and they love it but I am wondering why in 2009 they did not remaster it to HD? A Blu Ray release would have been huge!!!!!!
B003H8WSLQ|1.0|Why on earth do bands do this? They suck us in with a first album that redefines their genre, gain the respect and adulation of those who recognize brilliant creativity in it's purest form, wait two or five years to release a new album, and then end up copying all the other drivel out there stating \\"I can now put more of myself and my emotion into my music\\" I keep going back to Antidotes on my maxed-out Ipod, forgetting all the other music, even now after hearing it so many times. There is a reason for that. The incredible artistry of all the voices in the music working together flawlessly excites and inspires me so much more than anything I've heard in years. I was ready to crown them my favorite band and now I listen to these samples and I want to puke. I grew up on R.E.M. in the 80's, and they broke my heart album after album, from the 90's on, until I just gave up. How do you go from Gardening at Night to Shiny Happy People? But I only gave up on them because they gave up on themselves and the sound that their fans grew to love. C'mon Foals, at least put out a few albums of amazing music like Antidotes before breaking our hearts with stuff like this. We are all looking for that fantastic sound from some unappreciated new band that blows our minds. This does nothing of the sort. And don't even get me started on the album cover....Nirvana, Catherine Wheel....even that is far from original. I havent decided if I should spend my hard-earned cash on this yet, as I can't afford to go buying albums from my favorite bands expecting the same from them anymore.  -Broken Hearted
B00328G4V6|4.0|Review no. 134. For a Hendrix compilation, this twelve track release is really quite good. Kept hearing ads on a couple of radio stations for this as being an all-new Jimi Hendrix album. That's partially true - as there are three 'completely new' previously unreleased tunes within. The title cut \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\", his Cream cover \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" and \\"Crying Blue Rain\\". Keep in mind that there are at least two rare Hendrix songs here (that unless you have every one of his 'actual' lp's) you might not be that familiar with - \\"Ships Pass Through The Night\\" and \\"Lullaby For The Summer\\". Plus there are some (totally) different edits / versions of more well known Hendrix tunes - \\"Stone Free\\", the timeless \\"Fire\\" and \\"Redhouse\\". So, you get an hour of pure Hendrix + a 22-page CD booklet packed with info and photos. Highly recommended.
0060920084|2.0|I've read the other reviews and they all seem to sum up the variety of perspectives I would expect.  However, there is one point I feel should be addressed.  I've spent much time in the town of Gettysburg as my girlfriend's family lives there.  I normally wouldn't fault someone for being unfamiliar with the history or progression of the battle but Bryson is a different story.  Given that Bryson himself points out the immense importance of the battle and despairs at the failure to respect the battlefield, I feel that some nitpicking is warranted.  He mentions sarcastically that he could picture the Confederates advancing from the north through the town during Pickett's charge, through parking lots and tacky shops.  In fact, Bryson is wholly incorrect in this description.  Pickett's charge advanced from the West about a half mile south of the town across open field that has since been, and is today, open and unadulterated.      I recognize this distinction as nit-picky but as someone who feels so justified in lambasting the American education system but demonstrates his own massive ignorance about an event he considers to be of monumental importance, I can't help but be disappointed in Bryson.  In fact, I wonder how accurate any of his irreverent anecdotes are, or if he even went to any of these places at all.    I will admit that he is enormously funny and his humor resonates with me.  I find myself laughing out loud at some of his anecdotes.  However, I can't help but be disappointed in a person so close minded as to hold everything that is different from his own personal lifestyle (even if he only gets a glimpsing look) in utter contempt.    Prepare to be:  a) offended  b) lied to and/or misinformed  c) laughing at the end of it all
0143118420|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read some bad books. The first thing I could not stand was her lack of honesty with herself. Even though she tried to be funny and cute when she was \\"self-bashing\\", it was easy to read that it was more for the audience than being authentic about her feelings. Secondly, her psychobabble is beyond intolerable. Thirdly, she is so self-absorbed, she forgets to acknowledge that not everyone is the same and happiness for others mean different things. She is narrow minded and frankly cannot see past her own life. She find every excuse possible to explain why her life is more fruitful than the next person, when all I can see is a troubled and lonely human being. There are so many other books out there written by experts on the field, that I'm not sure why anyone bothers taking advice from someone who obviously wrote this book to boost her own ego.    Additionally, the idea that someone was given an advance to write a book about finding herself is... well, pretty disturbing considering the audience who is trying to follow Gilbert's footsteps. Should it not be the other way around? Should she not have had this revealing experience and then shared it with the world? After all, if she was 200k in the hole by the time she finished her trip, she pretty much had to write a book even if she only found disappointment.      Lastly, I find her dishonesty discouraging. At the beginning of the book she chooses to not disclose the fact that she cheated on her husband. Maybe that was the reason she didn't fight for the money when they were divorcing? In my opinion, she was deceiving and less than open about her life and her errors as a human being. She appeared more concerned on being likable than being honest. Recognizing who you are is part of the process of self-acceptance and change. I doubt that she has done either.      This is the first review I give on Amazon because I profusely dislike a woman, who in all honesty, I believe is selling a lie. Not to mention her writing is less than thought provoking. I did not read an intelligent statement in that book. I also find it offending on a personal level since my studies involve staying away from psychobabble and helping people individually. Providing resources and help based on studies published on medical journals. This type of book discredits true psychological research. Maybe offensive is the word to describe it.

0307454541|3.0|(8/11/2010) A sprawling, redundant, repetitive, insulting mess of a book. Like a crude first draft. Yet there is a great story buried here, under all the exposition. The book should've been cut by half, leaving out all the boring back-story, rewriting the clich&eacute;s, and respecting the reader more. The (Swedish) movie makers did a great job of cutting through the crap. It's my favorite movie in years.<br /><br />For the book, someone should publish a guide to what to skip. I bought a paperback so I could mark it up, and I've crossed out about a third, which is not nearly enough. The most amazing thing to me is that so many people seemed to read all the dull exposition and not mind it. Overall, worth a look, but it's a long, painful slog. If you just want to enjoy the story, see the movie instead.<br /><br />BTW, when you find a real scene in the book, once every 100 pages or so, it can be terrific. At times you feel like you're living on that island with Mikael and the Vangers. You are living his search. At other times, the back-story is so slow and boring you almost wish you were dead.<br /><br />(8/13/10) The last week or so, since I finished reading \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" I have had the strange urge to buy the next book in the series and keep on reading, just to keep living in that world, I guess. The book is strangely addictive, even though not well written. That must be something a bestseller does. Wish I knew how to do that.<br /><br />(10/12/14) Recently, I studied perhaps a dozen big bestselling thrillers and this was the best, oddly enough. It worked better for me on second reading. One reason for its popularity is there is no violence until about 200 pages in. Yet, there is plenty of suspense and the powerful devotion of its lead characters to trying to solve two compelling problems: the apparent murder of Harriet, the missing niece, and the restoration of Mikael Blomkvist's damaged career. The idea that one of the Vanger family murdered the lost girl is compelling, and the structure and character development are masterful, even though the writing is clunky.<br /><br />Obviously, the two lead characters are wonderful dramatic foils for each other, and  Lisbeth Salander is a wonderful underdog and damaged heroine. I greatly prefer a thriller like this to a Jack Reacher book or \\"Gone Girl,\\" both of which I found unbearable.racter development are masterful, even though the writing is clunky.

0143118420|1.0|I tried to like it, then when I realized that wasn't going to happen I just tried to finish, couldn't manage to do that either.  She just didn't come off as a likable person to me.  A little too selfish maybe.  I kept wondering why I should care about this experience of hers, that I would prefer to reserve those feelings for my friends and family.  Plus it was an experience that she was paid to have.  It seems like my generations literary contributions are all memiors, are we really that self-absorbed?  It doesn't even bother me as much when someone has an experience and then decides to write about it, but when they have an experience specifically for the purpose of making money off of it, I'm a little ashamed that I made a monetary contribution.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|Great watch. Classic look. Great attention to detail.    I haven't had any issues with the clasp. In fact, I remember complementing the clasp to my wife when it first arrived in the mail, so I only include a comment on it because it was mentioned in other reviews. Maybe Invicta addressed the issue? It has literally never come loose.    Also, the review mentioning the scratch-prone crystal must be a prior model, because the flame fusion crystal is awesome. I have already banged the crystal sufficient to gouge ordinary crystal, and it is still unblemished.    It does look a little purple in some light, but not most.    Overall awesome.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|The show on television was always extremely entertaining.  I saw the end of season 1 and was instantly hooked.  I must admit that, the first time I saw it, I thought it was just quite cheesy.  I had certainly judged a book by it's cover.  Just for the heck of it, I ventured to watch a few more episodes on Hulu, and I couldn't help but be drawn in by the plot.  Zed and Richard were a great pair when matched with Kahlan's fury and Cara's wit.  Although, I must say that the books are ten times more entertaining.  Had the t.v. series had been more true to the books, Richard would have been depicted as a much  more intelligent man. In fact, in Wizard's First Rule, he is so intelligent that he even outsmarts Zed once or twice, prompting Zed to consider him as a potential candidate for the first order of wizards.  The television series goes a different direction in characterizing Richard as exemplifying the street smart man without wizard-level wits.  Don't get me wrong; this is still entertaining.  He still seeks truth as he does in the book while following sound ethics.  But, ethics aren't always perfectly applicable to real world circumstances.  Sometimes, Richard must redefine his world view to cope with changing circumstances.  One such example is the need to form new alliances in order to save the world.  This is where Darken Rahl comes in, played by an excellent actor, mind you.  Out of all the actors, Darken Rahl's portrayal couldn't have been better at reflecting the inner conflicts and emotions he experiences in the book.  For example, one is never sure if is he cruel or attractive,  guilty or innocent,  pathetic or admirable. This uncertainty combined with his charisma make him out to be a very round character. The way Rahl manipulates the world around him, with his evil schemes and devices, helped to move the plot along quite well.  Zed's portrayal is also pretty spot on.  His facial features and general appearance are just as the book describes him to be, a man with an elongated face with very wrinkly skin wearing a raggedy robe.  His comments about Richard's obstinate attitude made me laugh plenty of times as did his conversations with Kara.  I only hope that the special, heart-touching chemistry formed between these actors is brought to the forefront again in a new season.    By the way, there is a way to help save the seeker!  Help us reach 50,000 signatures so that ABC studios can be convinced that producing a third season is worthwhile.  Please, go to [...].  Since only one person can register per computer, my suggestion is, if need be, go to your public library and use the computers there to sign the petition.    [...]
B003ITZBVI|4.0|First and foremost, I have not been impressed with the poor quality of DC animation lately. Superman, Wonder Woman, Green lantern etc have been drawn so basic and blocky with so little detail that I pretty much gave up.<br />Then I saw this Batman movie. It is drawn, written and acted much better than past versions.<br />The movie was not a short movie by any means. It was very entertaining and the flow of the plot kept my attention from start to finish.<br />Extras on the Bluray are awesome. There is a full Jonah Hex episode, past history videos of both Dick Grayson (1st Robin - Now Nightwing) and Jason Todd (2nd Robin). 4 extra episodes that were hand selected to show some back story and much more.<br />I have read that the digital copy is very limited what programs can play it. I cannot verify this because I have not used my digital copy yet.<br />SPOILER<br />People can complain all they want that Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was \\"brought back to life\\" even though I have to agree, I was glad to see his whiney butt ended in past comics. It's a comic book people! Write your own comics if you don't like it. The way they brought him back actually intrigued me. Watch and find out how.<br />I recommend this DVD highly for comic and DC fans.
B003J27WFW|5.0|What a great DVD for Rush fans.  The early videos are great.  The number of musicians that have been influenced by Rush is huge.  They truely are a unique band--love them or hate them.  One of the best things in the video is the dinner at the hunting lodge.  I couldn't stop laughing!  Those scenes are worth the price right there.  Alex has a tremendous sense of humor.  I think the most important thing these guys have is a true friendship for each other and they don't take themselves overly seriously.  Really, a must-see for Rush fans.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is one of our absolute favorite new Disney movies. This brings back everything we loved about the classics. Great songs, great story, and lots of fun. I would suggest this to anyone, child or adult!
B000002I99|4.0|I have been listening to Alice Cooper for years now but it's just been the classics from the Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits CD and the tracks from Classicks. Recently I decided to dive in a little deeper into Alice's world. I purchased Killer and Welcome To My Nightmare for starters. I was instantly enamored by the fine piece of work that is Killer. I listened to it 3 times over on my first listen.<br /><br />When it came time to pop Welcome To My Nightmare into the CD player I wasn't quite so pleased with what I heard. Of course I instantly liked Only Women Bleed (since I already knew the live version from Classicks), Welcome To My Nightmare (I used to work in a party supply store that played that song along with other \\"Halloween\\" type music during the month of October), and Department of Youth (I remembered this one from the Alice Cooper Prime Cuts Documentary). With tracks like Cold Ethyl, The Black Widow, and Escape, I knew immediately that with a few listens I'd end up liking them. When I first heard Years Ago and Steven I felt like I really was in a Nightmare. They reminded me of the song Killer from the album of the same name. Lots of random sounds and noise more than an actual song. I did not see myself liking that portion of the CD whatsoever.<br /><br />After the first listen was complete, I took the CD out of the player and honestly didn't have much desire to ever put it back in. Honestly as soon as I removed Nightmare from my CD player I put Killer back in to make up for the not so pleasant sounds I had just heard.<br /><br />A couple days later I was walking through my current place of work and saw a sign that said Attn: Steven (some last name that I can't remember). Instantly the \\"Steven! I hear my name!\\" part of the song Steven popped into my head. For the rest of the night at work I had that part in my head. When I got off I decided to give Nightmare another chance and I won't say that I was instantly in love with the songs but I was much more into them than my first listen.<br /><br />Now, many listens later, I really like the CD. I still don't like it as much as Killer or some of the other songs that I was already more familiar with but it is a thing of beauty. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone wanting to become more familiar with Alice but if you are more familiar with his earlier stuff from the Alice Cooper band of even his later stuff, just listen to this CD with an open mind because it won't be like anything you've EVER heard before.m than my first listen.<br /><br />Now, many listens later, I really like the CD.

B003HLM2QO|5.0|I really don't know why some have given this album a bad review.  It makes me wonder if they actually spent time LISTENING to it before writing their review.  Yes, Ozzy is old.  Yes, he makes different music than he did with Sabbath.  Yes, he's rich and can do what he wants.  Who cares.  This album ROCKS, and that's all that needs to be said.  I've listened to this album straight through about 25 times since it was released - that's how much I love it. It is the hardest rocking album I've heard in YEARS!  I definitely think Ozzy and Slash are saving rock music as we know it.<br /><br />Gus G. is a suberb replacement for Zakk, as Zakk's chaotic playing was starting to annoy me. Gus is a phenomenal guitarist in every way, and Ozzy should really stick with him from here on out.  Ozzy's vocals sound deeper, harder, and better than they have sounded on recent albums. And overall, this music is MUCH harder than his last few albums, which is a welcome surprise. Believe me - play the song \\"Scream\\" in your car LOUD, and you will have a hard time driving the speed limit.<br /><br />There isn't a bad song on the entire album.  Just put your preconceived notions about Ozzy aside, buy it, and just listen.  You won't regret it.
0439023483|5.0|My husband and I both read this book and are excited for the next two.  It is geared toward a younger audience so it make it and easy read but a great plot and character development. I would recommend this book:)
0385737947|5.0|To my fellow dystopian, postapoc, YA fic lovers - I highly recommend this one!  I couldn't find this in my local library (although it was at my son's book fair) so I am buying a copy and donating it!    PROS:  Like Hunger Games meets Lord of the Flies, it strikes a wonderful balance between the grittiness of the boys' interactions and the affection they necessarily have for each other.  There is one scene with Thomas and another boy that had such genuine tenderness I cried (due in no small part because I am the mother of three sons).  The glade slang worked for me and allowed a realism to the harshness and language which is not always possible in YA fiction (this is in contrast to the Uglies series slang which irritated me).  The book is strongly plot-driven and moves fast (almost to a fault), but I didn't find the characters suffered.  In fact, I had a real attachment to Thomas, Chuck, Newt, Minho, and even Alby!  I have to admit I was blindsided by the Epilogue and had to read it twice to believe it!    CONS:  The \\"answers\\" seem a little bit contrived, but within the confines of the reality created by Dashner, it worked for me.  Some complained the ending was a little abrupt, which it is, but it propelled you right into Book 2.  I did have a small problem picturing Thomas and the Grievers for some reason, but that was my only real \\"show, don't tell\\" complaint.    It has a cliffhanger of an ending though so you might want to wait for the second one that comes out in Oct!     PARENTS NOTE:  The grade suggestion of 6 - 10 is probably appropriate based on reading level, but the graphic violence, the sexual aggression hinted at when the girl arrives, and the thinly-veiled use of the \\"f word\\" would probably push my grade-level suggestion toward the higher end of that range.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Kylie has done it again by putting her angelic voice on another golden masterpiece. This time she decides to keep a dance-themed album and present herself as the Goddess of love, Aphrodite. The title is very fitting since every song on the album has to do with all aspects of love. Not only are the lyrics romantic and moving, but the club-driven beats create a \\"dancing on cloud nine\\" kind of feeling. The first single, \\"All The Lovers\\" is a perfect opener with very moving music and melodies that can set the emotional mood for any person who is in love or wants to be in love. Other songs like, \\"Get Outta My Way\\", \\"Put Your Hands Up\\", \\"Better Than Today\\", \\"Too Much\\", and \\"Cupid Boy\\" are also the best stand out tracks on this album that provides positive lyrics, fun-filled catchy tunes, and get under the disco ball influences. Kylie definitely proves on this record that love and dancing brings you closer to Heaven and she is truly a dancefloor Goddess.Excellent job Kylie!... or should we say, \\"Aphrodite\\"? :)
B003O85W3A|4.0|Yeah, I figured that everyone & their brother would be singing the praises of this one.  Here's my 2 cents worth: 3rd album from these Montreal, Canada stalwarts of the indie rock scene is composed of big,<br />  modern, inquisitive pop/rock songs with a near-epic quality, driven by multi-tracked instruments<br />  spread over poignant & catchy melodies with perceptive lyrics that explore the fallacy of the<br />  suburban dream experience.  Organically prodigious, anthemic tunes laid on a conceptual string<br />  that vibrates with the tenacity of driving expansionism.  These songs range from easy flowing pop<br />  structures to aggressive, complex & sophisticated rock--all sealed with a kiss of sincerity.  It feels<br />  like it could be a grower.  Aside to the reviewer who thought that Papa Roach was better than Arcade Fire:  I like your review.  It was really funny.  It was meant to be funny, wasn't it?
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|The Amazon Universal Digital Camera case is perfect for my new Flip camcorder.  My digital camera also fits in the case with no problems.  This soft-sided case is sturdy and attractive.  The user has the ability to strap the case directly on his or her belt or backpack strap.  This makes it very easy to take with you when sightseeing or hiking, or while enjoying an amusement park--no need to carry a purse or other case. I recommend this product.

B0000024ZI|5.0|The story of the creation of `All the Young Dudes', Mott the Hoople's breakthrough fifth album is legendary but I will give you the cliff notes version. Mott broke up after four good but unsuccessfully commercial LP's when famous fan David Bowie gave them a song and offered to produce a new record for them if they stuck it out. Of course the song was \\"All the Young Dudes\\" which along with the parent album of the same name made Mott the Hoople glam rock superstars. Mott even scored with US audiences which had been indifferent to their earlier efforts. Bowie no doubt deserves some credit here but the band had been on the upswing as `Brain Capers' was a terrific record but a dismal seller; so the talent was always there.  `Dudes' the LP is also a great album including three songs back to back that could form the cornerstone of early seventies glam/hard rock - \\"Sucker\\", \\"Jerkin' Crocus\\" and \\"One of the Boys\\"; all outstanding efforts that clearly define the classic Mott the Hoople sound. Lou Reed is also covered here as \\"Sweet Jane\\" opens the album in a propulsive manner (another Bowie influence as Reed was one of his heroes). Though Ian Hunter (and his shades) had become the star and focal point in the band, Mick Ralphs still contributed mightily - previewing later Bad Co. standard \\"Ready for Love\\" (though Mott does it in two parts) and his guitar shines throughout. `Dudes' the LP would actually end the original lineup of Mott as Verden Allen left after the record was completed (previewing Ralph's own departure one record later) but if this was to be the last run of glory for the original band, they went out with a glam bang! My baby call me when you want a tale....
B002ZG997M|4.0|As I have just watched and reviewed [[ASIN:B001FB563E The Road [Blu-ray]]] and I actually watched this movie first, I felt it only fair that I should review it as well, as they both deal with a similar plotline, but are starkly different movies.<br />The synopsis is covered in great detail above (and in other reviews) so I won't spend too long on that, or put in any spoilers, but this story is so much more than was quite unfairly described by one professional critic as \\"The Road Warrior (Mad Max) without cars!\\"<br />Denzel Washington plays a nomadic man on a mission, wandering for some 30 years through a post apocalyptic landscape carrying the last known copy of the King James Bible, answering a calling, and quest to deliver it somewhere important, knowing only that he must go west.<br />Like the aforementioned \\"Road\\" he is waylaid by marauding gangs, cannibalism, and a general dystopian population left either blind or maimed by whatever catastrophe occurred. Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.<br />That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.<br />I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.<br />Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the \\"journey\\" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.<br />Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.<br />I knocked off half a star (maybe unfairly) for the frequent, \\"is he or isn't he?\\", \\"how did he do that\\", \\"how come they......\\" aspects of the movie, but I guess some poetic license by the Director is not all bad.<br />Very impressive, visually stunning movie. 4.5 starser little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have logged about 150 miles so far with the device and I must say I really like it. I have not used others, so I have not basis for comparison. I find the GPS works extremely well. I like all of the features and the ease of uploading my results to my computer and/or the Garmin Connect website. It is not the easiest to use, primarily because it can do so many things and there are a ton of options. I have not devoted the time to customizing it for my personal taste, though I plan to do so soon. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.

B002N5N5M0|3.0|I very much enjoyed the 1st three seasons - it quickly became my favorite show. However, this season took a turn for the worse.  Previously, Dexter was able to keep his habit from causing discomfort for the audience by the type of persons he took down, and he was able to keep his personal life separated from his late-night activities.  Now with the complications in his life (marriage, cohabitation, kids), the writers were unable to maintain that.  If they ever go the way the books have gone, I will totally quit the show.  As it is, this season dropped me to a casual viewer rather than a dedicated one.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|Tied with the Dark Knight, this movie blew me away, the emotion it had was palpable - and heartbreaking , this is the story I have been waiting for all these years after reading Death in the Family. The tone is set right away with a great musical score which is similar in tone to the Dark Knight. The portrayal of the Joker is far creepier than Heath Ledger's performance though not as scary. This movie gives me the chills as to how great it truly is. If you consider yourself a Batman fan at all, please watch this. If you ever read Death in the Family , PLEASE watch this, I need a sequel NOW!!!!!!!!!
B003IODNJA|5.0|For an album that was not particularly popular, Propaganda's A Secret Wish certainly has had legs.         Now, for my money, this is possibly the best album of the 1980's. It's a grand slice of high-brow yet trashy, epic, orchestral and bubblegum synth-pop. The contrasts and contradictions keep this album sounding as fresh as the day it was released while sounding like the perfect mid-80's time capsule.     And speaking of 'the day it was released', I first heard this on LP sometime around that day and bought the cassette immediately, which I wore out. A few years later I bought it on CD and was confused as to why the tracks didn't quite match up to the tracklist but kept it in regular rotation for the next 10 years or so.         Enter the 20th anniversary edition. What a revelation! So many remixed tracks, I was ecstatic. Obviously, I had owned the US edition of the CD which duplicated the LP/tape release, why would I have guessed that there was an almost completely different album out there? So now with the 2 remix CDs (Outside World and Wishful Thinking) there were 4 CDs worth of prime Propaganda.            And now here's the 25th Anniversary Edition, the definative version of A Secret Wish containing both the LP and CD versions along with yet another disc of remixes (with only a slight overlap with the other 2 CDs of remixes) from an album that was 'not particularly popular'. Not too shabby.        5 stars+

145283668X|4.0|I definitely recommend this as a quick, but fascinating read. It's not only thought-provoking, discussion-lending and well-written, but in the case of this copy, aesthetically pleasing and really well designed by Cricket House Books. Stevenson creatively captures the essence of so much human struggle - the capacity for both good and evil within each human being - and the tragic consequences that result when evil is given sway. It would be an appealing choice for teen and adult readers or book clubs.
0545123275|3.0|Forewarning: I'm a 20 year old guy, so doubtfully part of the authors target audience, take that for what you will.    I thought the dialog was cute and witty, if the banter hadn't kept me entertained, I'd probably have put this book down inside of 50 pages. The other aspects of the story weren't bad enough to be distracting, but they didn't really add much either.    The central plot could've been interesting but it stayed mostly stagnant except for brief flurries of action. I'd rant more about that, but I feel like these books are more about character than plot.    Emotionally speaking, the main characters had plenty of depth, but sometimes they struck me as a little inconsistent, particularly across perspectives. Personality wise I found both leads to be a little lacking as well, probably because we only really get to see them interact with each other. It doesn't help that they're usually love drunk in each other's presence (though in cute way).    So, in a nutshell: Plenty of Cute and/or witty banter which keeps the story entertaining, but not a lot of substance otherwise.    Oh also, I'd have to resign my manhood if I didn't mention that there're no sex-scenes in this book. There's plenty of passionate kissing, but thing's get vague beyond that.
0307655105|5.0|I LOVE this book!  I loved it as a child and now my children love it.  It covers so many topics......weather, transporation, city life, country life, how plants grow, how colors mix to create other colors!  It has pages that cover the topics of ABCs, numbers and every day skills.  And SO much more.    Other reviewers have said it's not exactly the same as the first editions.....less pages and things added (like a bow added to a bear's head to make it a girl worker on a construction site).  These things are really NO big deal.  The books is awesome as is and unless you are comparing back and forth between a newer and later edition, you'd never notice.      Enjoy! Great for every child :)
0061148512|4.0|The poet in Sylvia Plath emerged in the entire course of the novel. Her descriptions are nothing short of beautiful, and the life of Esther Greenwood plays before your mind's eye like a motion picture. The opening image of New York city is so vivid you can practically feel the heat of summer in the city: \\"Mirage-gray at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat\\". I love it. The words ebb and flow and just create.<br /><br />It is tough following a woman down into her depression. She has this great life working as an intern for a fashion magazine in the heart of New York City, and then, she just doesn't care anymore. Her life whirls around her and it's as if she just wants to get off the ride. And the voice is very conversational, very informal. I could relate to the character; even though I'm not depressed myself, I felt sympathy and friendship with Esther. If I had known her, I would have visited her in the asylum.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good book, thought-provoking, creative, a bit morbid, but well worth the read.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Like a lot of people I have been playing the \\"Prince of Persia\\" video games since \\"The Sands of Time\\" came out for Ninetendo Gamecube way back when.<br />I fell in love with that game and the franchise, so when I heard they were doing a live action film my first impression was...WHY???<br />Then I heard they cast Jake Gyllenhaal. (Going forward I will call him JG)<br />Granted JG's a great actor, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", \\"Jarhead\\", \\"Zodiac\\".<br />JG's one of the most underrated and underappreciated actors in Hollywood.<br />But JG as The Prince of Persia???<br />I had my doubts.<br />The only actor I knew in the movie was Ben Kingsley, so I knew HE would at least add a touch of class and excellence to the movie and he does.<br />Now....I wasn't expecting this movie to be a masterpiece and it wasn't...not by a long shot.<br />But for a video game to film translation...this movie is probably the best of the bunch.<br />Anyone who's seen any of the game to movie translations will probably agree with me that thanks to Uwe Boll the majority of these movies have been simply horrid.<br />Thankfully \\"Prince\\" does not suffer the same fate.<br />As for JG playing the Prince.<br />There is one scene where I really went...OMG he DOES look just like the Prince.<br />Not the Prince from \\"Sands of Time\\" but the grizzly one from the second game \\"The Warrior Within\\".<br />The hair, the beard, the outfit, he's a dead ringer except for his big eyes kind of ruin the effect.<br /><br />Ok but besides that what is good?<br />The script is excellent.<br />The acting is top notch and for a movie like this is almost unheard of.<br />The FX are of course simply the best you could hope for but the film hardly relies on FX and instead uses them to compliment the story.<br />All the Prince's moves are accounted for. The platforming, the wall runs, etc... without looking fake or corny.<br />The sand rewind was just as I expected it to be, awesome.<br /><br />What was bad?<br />Parts of it were corny and hokey.<br />The ostrich races and that whole gang of comic relief characters could have been cut out of the film entirely.<br />The film itself is WAY too long.<br />At almost two hours I literally had to force myself from falling asleep during the middle part of the movie.<br />A half hour could have been trimmed easily and nothing would have been lost.<br />In fact a movie like this almost has to move at a breakneck pace to match the subject matter.<br />But it didn't.<br />Those minor points aside I'll sum up \\"Prince of Persia\\" like this.<br /><br />Excellent story.<br />Excellent acting.<br />Not so good pacing.<br />Great FX.<br />Recommended?<br />If you have the patience for two hours and are as big a fan of the video games as I am, then yes.<br />The rest of you may want to wait.<br />Me?<br />I thought it was a great popcorn movie and I look forward to the next one.<br />Recommended.rs could have been cut out of the film entirely.   The film itself is WAY too long.   At almost two hours I literally had to force myself from falling asleep during the middle part of the movie.   A half hour could have been trimmed easily and nothing would have been lost.   In fact a movie like this almost has to move at a breakneck pace to match the subject matter.   But it didn't.   Those minor points aside I'll sum up \\"Prince of Persia\\" like this.     Excellent story.   Excellent acting.   Not so good pacing.   Great FX.   Recommended?

B003TZ9EGO|5.0|Overall this is a great remix cd.  There is only one remix that I am indifferent to, and that is the mix for Telephone.  A little disappointed with that one.  Bad Romance has some fantastic moments, but is just a little weak.  The rest of the mixes are excellent.  If you are a Lady Gaga fan you must have and will love this cd.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|Regarding the field of original animated direct-to-DVD movies, DC is kicking the crapdoodle out of Marvel. BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, running at around 76 minutes, is another well-executed, highly charged superhero thriller, and it's dark and compelling, and never mind that I wasn't that into the Red Hood saga when it was in comics form. This movie improves on the comic book.<br /><br />Remember about 20 years ago when DC put out an 800 number so that you and I could call in to determine Robin's fate? And the votes came in, and that marked the end of the annoying second Boy Wonder. Since then, Robin's death has been regarded as Batman's greatest failure.<br /><br />BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD opens in Bosnia and has us reliving that story, with the Joker's savage beating and eventual murder of Jason Todd, with the Batman come too late to save him. Five years later, a new masked man's come to Gotham City, and he's playing both sides of the field, a vigilante vastly more ruthless than the Dark Knight and simultaneously a crime lord craving a slice of that crooked pie. The Red Hood believes he's saving Gotham by taking control of the city's criminal elements. Inexorably he carves out his own territory, digesting chunks of the Black Mask's empire, igniting a gang war. Batman finds himself caught in the middle, and then he begins to harbor a horrifying suspicion as to who's really under the Red Hood.<br /><br />Unlike in the comic book, there isn't much of a mystery regarding the Red Hood's true identity. Instead of the mystery element, we're enfolded in bits of powerful storytelling. Almost shattering. The strength of the narrative lies in how it keeps resurrecting themes of broken relationships and failed promises and warped vengeance and devastating guilt, and it's like picking and picking at a scab until the blood seeps. In their final showdown, the Red Hood fiercely justifies himself to Batman and, honestly, I think he makes some very valid points. For instance, how many deaths is Batman indirectly responsible for by allowing the Joker to live?<br /><br />Tim Drake, the third Robin, isn't here, and it's a good move. His presence would've made the story more cluttered. Instead, Batman gets an assist from Nightwing, and it sucks that Nightwing isn't in the movie more. Neil Patrick Harris absolutely does him justice and provides levity to a brooding tale, but then again Dr. Horrible can do no wrong. For a voice cast that's new to DC animation, these actors perform well and emotionally hook you in. I would never have thought of Bruce Greenwood to voice Batman, but he's very effective, although I hesitate to say that he makes Batman his own. I hear too much of Kevin Conroy in his performance. John Dimaggio as Joker takes a bit of getting used to, as well, but it's not bad. His verbals are deeper than Mark Hamill's, and it helps that this Joker is depicted as with more bulk. Jensen Ackles (SUPERNATURAL) makes the Red Hood an almost sympathetic and certainly tragic character. I have to say, I very much see where the Red Hood is coming from.<br /><br />Pretty good animation, even though Black Mask looks more like the Red Skull. Very good action, an appropriate dose of violence, with the Red Hood giving as good as he gets, although I like that he does get hit, he does get bloodied. Except that he's too stubborn to quit. Batman, of course, is Batman. This film earns its PG-13 rating just by virtue of its disturbing opening scene. The \\"payoff\\" moments take place off-screen, but you can't prevent those violent images from surfacing in your brain. Joker, deranged and taunting, applying that crowbar to Jason Todd. Even though DC makes the film more accessible by refraining from showing bruises or too much blood on Jason. Still, don't let the younger kids see this. Also, along the way, the Red Hood kills several times.<br /><br />Now can I please talk about the Jonah Hex animated short? It continues that stamp of excellence that so marked the Spectre animated short featured on the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD.

And, if you already haven't heard, Warner Brothers is planning to release a DC Showcase DVD featuring four animated shorts: the Spectre short, this Jonah Hex one, the Green Arrow short which will be on the upcoming SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD, and a never before seen short: \\"Superman/Shazam! - The Return of Black Adam.\\" Look for that DVD on November 2010.<br /><br />Back to BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD.

B00180R06I|5.0|A young journeyman who is obsessed with the occult finds himself trapped between Heaven and Hell in a mysterious inn where vampires and other creatures stalk the night, draining the town's inhabitants of life. Carl Dryer creates a surreal world of nightmares and dreamscapes in this haunting tale. Moving away from the static camerawork found in early film, Dryer implements a roving camera and classical cutting style in order to maximize the impact of the dreary images and frightening performances. VAMPYR is a study in contrasts and form, using light, dark, and shadows as integral players in the visual canvas. With virtually no dialog or narrative to be found, Dryer relies mostly on the intensity of the images in order to tell his story. As history denotes, the foggy and washed-out effect that appears in many of the scenes resulted from an accidental exposure of the film stock, but this fortunate mistake contributes to the eerie mood and unsettling atmosphere. A true living nightmare, VAMPYR is Expressionist Horror in its purest form, and a genuine classic.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener does nice work with my CRKT  m16 knife which has gotten pretty dull (i abuse my knives). The carbide blade reset it fairly quick, but def not in the 10 or so strokes the company says it will take. The ceramic finisher is a nice touch up. Cant say much about the \\"diamond coated rod\\" though, the serrations on my blade have always been sharp. I tried this with my Panga machete too, did a decent job but took awhile just to get a decent edge. This isnt  for people who are really specific about their expensive knives, but if you have a couple edges that could use a good sharpen, this could be for you.<br /><br />Pros: Carbide and ceramic blades are can be replaced. (The other side could be used too)<br />Very compact, stick it in your pack or in your glovebox and you'll never be without it<br />Very affordable, sharpens numerous times at a meager cost<br />Works fairly well, but it works<br /><br />Cons: Set degree (20 or so on each side im guessing), but its general purpose so it works for me with a couple outdoor knives<br />Sharpening rod seems a bit cheap<br />takes a longer time to sharpen then one would imagine<br /><br />Verdict: Overall a great product, and even if you are a knife enthusiast, keep one around, you'll never know when you'll need it.
1401310400|5.0|\\"Heat Wave\\" is more than a book. It is an excellent continuation of a marvelous television series.  Some generous author has written this book, given time and creative energy, and produced a work that she or he may never be able to claim. It takes a lot to create a book. To create a viable, interesting mystery in the spirit of a series is quite amazing.  Without giving away the plot, I can say that the story is true to the series, even to the point of being what Ric Castle would have written rather than what the series itself portrays. For those of us who love Ric Castle, his home family and his work family, this is a great continuation. Thanks to the true author, who writes a lot like Stephen Cannell. I hope you get the royalties.

B003O85W3A|4.0|Controlled chaos.<br /><br />That might be the best way to describe the Arcade Fire and their new release, the Suburbs.<br /><br />Most, if not all, the Montreal based septet are multi-instrumentalists and take some part in the writing of each song, though Win Butler does most of the writing/heavy lifting. But Arcade Fire is creative in ways of arrangements and mixing instruments like no other band.<br /><br />The Suburbs is longer than their first two disks - over an hour of music. It is seemingly more of a combination of their debut Funeral and its follow-up Neon Bible than it is a departure. The jury is still out (with me) as if it is better than Neon Bible, let alone what I would consider the best disk of 2010.<br /><br />Though not billed as a \\"concept album\\", one might take it that way if so chosen.<br /><br />I can't help thinking that some of the disk is out of sequence if this were a concept disk. The excellent \\"Wasted Hours\\" would be right at the front of the playlist (\\"first they built the roads; then they built the town\\"). Then the disk could have kicked into \\"Ready to Start\\" - and it does kick.<br /><br />With \\"Ready to Start\\", sometimes it seems this is the song with most energy, passion and sincerity. (\\"if I was yours, but I'm not\\" or \\"I would rather be alone; than pretend I feel alright\\", but then conversely Butler sings: \\"but to bow down to them anyway; is better than to be alone\\".) Yes, life is the suburbs is no picnic.<br /><br />That song really is the killer track on this disk. I have played it dozens of times and am really into it. But I think AF does a great job on \\"Rocco\\", \\"Modern Man\\", \\"City with No Children\\", \\"Suburban War\\" and \\"We Used to Wait\\". The latter song takes a while to kind of get going. Hell, the first half of it is two piano keys, but I'm really digging it.<br /><br />I also like both \\"Sprawl I (Flatlands)\\" and \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\\". Ditto with \\"Half Light\\" I and II.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I was not much of a fan of R&eacute;gine Chassagne. But for her work on this disk, I'm at least enjoying: \\"Sprawl II\\" works, as does \\"Empty Room\\" \\"Half Light\\" Maybe on the latter tracks (I and II), she does more singing with Butler. Her songs here are somewhat reminiscent of \\"In the Backseat\\" from Funeral. I didn't like anything she did on Neon Bible.<br /><br />I want to like the title tracks more. I like the lyrics and the melody enough, but the Joplin-esque piano drives me to distraction. The reprise is somewhat throwaway, yet necessary almost to end the disk.<br /><br />\\"Month of May\\" starts out incredibly strong, until vocals are put into the mix. I was so excited when it started, but it is hard to sit through for me. But for all their mania, there are a number of slower songs, which while they existed on other disks, they did not seem as sparse.<br /><br />Yes, there is a lot going on with the Suburbs, but the same can be said for all their disks. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I saw their live-stream Madison Square Garden set and much of this works better live than on album.<br /><br />My current conclusion (always subject to change with further listenings), is that it's a very good disk, but right now, not great.

044654146X|5.0|Dan Senor and Saul Singer - Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle.<br /><br />How is it that Israel, population 7,500,000 has more companies listed on the NASDAQ than all of Europe, population 300,000,000? Can it be just explained away by their \\"Jewishness?\\" This is the question Senor and Singer set out to answer in their new book, Start-up Nation.<br />Dan Senor is a policy advisor and political analyst, currently adjunct senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Saul Singer is a journalist living in Jerusalem. They approach this anecdotally, stitching together a explanation that includes the impact of the military, the role of the reserve structure, the collection of quality universities, the continuing influx of motivated and risk-embracing immigrants, and perversely, the constraint that Israeli companies cannot trade with any of the countries on its border.<br /><br />The role of the military on developing a specific culture of innovation and chutzpah is most interesting to me. There are two aspects that the authors emphasize. First, because of the threat to the nation, there is a zealous dedication to leadership mechanisms that work. This includes boisterous debate prior to decisions and robust and honest deconstructions of events after the fact. Members learn to respect competence, and have an irreverence for rank. The second important contribution is Israel's reserve structure. In effect, military organizations coming together annually to drill form egalitarian networks that would-be entrepreneurs tap in to.<br /><br />Another structural aspect of the Israeli military is it's relative understaffing of senior officers relative to junior officers:  1 to 5 in the U.S. Army; 1 to 9 in the IDF. This deliberately lean staffing results in junior officers being thrust into position where they must make key decisions early in their careers. They are tested and their judgment honed.<br /><br />I'm not Jewish but I can't help but think there's at least one more thing at play here, not reported by the authors. My experience is that trust significantly reduces transaction costs and speeds interaction. I wonder what the almost homogeneous Jewish population plays in allowing strangers to achieve high levels of trust rapidly, quickly achieving collaborative and common success.<br /><br />My name is David Marquet, from Practicum, Inc and we help our customers get everyone be a leader and avoid casting employees into follower roles.

I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters \\"NA\\" and ending with \\"R1\\" for the old version or \\"R2\\" for the new.

After a short period of time I was pressing 90lb dumbbells and feeling good again. This body weight stuff looked too easy. Big mistake. I've only just started this program but I can already tell it is a lot better for my body and it makes the gym feel easy - no matter how hard you push it at the gym.<br /><br />Can you, mr big gym man, do a spiderman? I doubt it. The compound exercises and techniques like ladder and so on combine together to give you a much more practical type of fitness. I don't know about you, but when lifting, hauling, pushing things in the real world, I don't get to support my back against a seat back and use an isolated muscle! This type of fitness will really grow your stabilizing muscles so much more.<br /><br />At first, I laughed at exercises like burpees. Really not laughing after even just 20 of them, never mind 50 - 100.<br /><br />Really looking forward to being able to do some of the level 4 exercises like the spiderman and that one where you do a push up but also lift your legs!<br /><br />I don't care if some of this stuff is like yoga but renamed, or exercises that have been taught for centuries. It is well thought out and communicated in such a way as to make it accessible to everyone.<br /><br />ps, I just calculated that I would create $600,000 of savings by putting my $45 gym membership in a good growth stock mutual fund for the next 40 years (accounting for inflation so the $45 would increase by 3% also).<br /><br />__________<br /><br />I just came across my review and had to add to it for my experience one year or so later. For most of thisyear, I was saving my business and trying to spend the very little down time I had with my family. So with all of that, I neglected the plan and doing so definitely affected my health and how well I was taking care of myself. I've only just got gotten back onto the First Class plan (plan 2 of 4) and I'm on week 7. I feel so much better than I did 7 weeks ago and it that short amount of time, I've progressed much quicker than I ever did at pushing iron around. Now, when I have a busy week at work, I'm more careful to get that session in, even at a lunch break, because I know I need to in order to be 100% at work and home.<br /><br />FUNCTIONAL: This time around I've really appreciated the functional side to this fitness. I moved office this week and wasn't ever afraid of injuring myself from lifting incorrectly or having to carry heavy, awkward objectives. You can get strong at a gym but the compound exercises set me up perfectly for all the full body lifts, pushes, pulls and holds I had to do. To me, that's functional. Even if you're a specialist in some sport and functional means something else to you than it does for me, I think having a strong core, better flexibility and balance along with the proficiency of having practiced lots of full body movements in the program makes for a real-world functional body. You can't rely on the guidance and support of a machine when lifting heavy goods so why would you train by using a some type of squat machine in the gym?<br /><br />He has an iphone and android app and to be honest, that is what has made a huge difference this time around. I don't need to find the table in the book/ebook and then refind an exercise if I'm not sure about it and all that jazz. I put my iphone in my armband, turn the app on and press 'Start workout'. It then guides me through the whole thing with timers and rest periods along with pictures and writing on each exercise and type of workout (ladders/tabatas/supersets etc.). This solved my biggest frustration so now all have to think about it doing the work! Having said that, I would strongly recommend reading the book first, then getting the app. I've recommended the app to many friends and without reading the book, they want to pick and choose exercises from it but I know they don't. The understanding you gain from the book shifts your perspective on the body weights so you take a more purposeful approach rather than throwing in a few body weights you pick from an app.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />Cheers, David.<br /><br />______<br /><br />Just came across this and had to give it another update. I mentioned in the last update that I was in week 7 of of plan 2 of 4, that's the First Class program. I finished that up and then went into and completed the Master Class program. I didn't mention his periodization before and I think that is a big part of the success of his programs. In his traditional programs you basically change your routine every 2 weeks. So for two weeks you may be focusing on endurance, then for 2 weeks you may focus on strength, then power and so on. Not only does this work with your body so you don't plateau but it's also mentally beneficial too. It gives you a bit of a break and provides different short-term goals. One week you're trying to stay consistent and hit a high number of reps then you do a strength block and you're trying to hit some low numbers before or by the time you fail and cannot do any more.<br /><br />This plan is now my winter training plan and I use the exercises throughout the other seasons for my core. I've made this switch only because I've started cycling again after a 9-year hiatus and that requires very sport specific training. I only have time to train for one thing each day so it's cycling now. However, I'm really missing my upper body strength as I had gotten to the point where I coud do one-arm pushups quite easily and handstand pushups were also a brease. I'm looking forward to getting back into it heresoon. When early spring comes and I'm putting more focus back on cycling again, I'll make sure I don't completely turn this program off again but rather do maintenance during the cycling season instead.<br /><br />Lastly, I've had a personal trainer for my cycling and he has prescribed for me specific workouts according to my cycling goals and my weekly schedule. To be honest, the YAROG is almost on par with this high level of personal training because it's done so well and because it doesn't take a lot of time each day. My cycling trainer has state champion athletes and has won national pro races himself so I don't say this lightly. When it comes to overal strengthening and fitness, these programs feel like they are tailor made for you if you just do what he says.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|This is an incredible film that takes off where the ill-fated television series left off.  Many questions are answered from the series.  I just can't believe there hasn't been a sequel.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Cannot find these anywhere in the regular commercial world.  Almost had to trash a $100.00 headset because the earpiece broke.  These are top quality earpieces and the package gives you two spares.  Best price on the internet.  Thank you very much.
B0013ND30W|2.0|This is easily the worst disc we have ever watched.  Not because of the movie itself, which is a faithful - even gorgeous - transfer.  But in the battle to get to see it.    First off, this disc includes TEN ads in the beginning!  Fortunately, depending your player you can chapter skip, and so I did.  Over, and over, and over. And then the screen went black, and I had to do it all again.  It took almost 5 minutes just to GET to the movie!      Second, and perhaps worse, is the disc doesn't play for 2-3 minutes even when you DO get to the movie!  This isn't a mistake, it actually warns you of this as the disc starts.  And true to it's word, it just goes black for so long you think it's broken.  If you get to the point of the disc playing, you literally have time to go make yourself a snack!    Combined, these 'features' are so infuriating that they cast a dark pall over the entire movie that never really went away.  The best word to describe it is 'abusive.'  I think Walt would roll in his grave if he knew how miserable an experience Disney has wrapped around and in front of his classic.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I had put off buying this because I'd anticipated a repeat of previous releases -- the ho-hum, cozy/warm vibe of King's \\"Living Room Tour\\" and Taylor's \\"Live,\\" both of which served as late-career retrospectives.  How surprised I was when I heard the music; providing backup is the original rhythm section -- once called The Section -- which helped define the sound for both artists on their seminal records (Danny Kortchmar, Lee Sklar and Russ Kunkel.)  This makes all the difference -- and probably comes close to recreating the original sound of both artists when they played the L.A. Troubadour back in the day (which was indeed the intent of this concert, as the pair united to celebrate the venue's fiftieth anniversary).  There's some muscle here, even a hint of distortion in Kortchmar's guitar, that helps vault both artists' songs into energetic readings that get under the skin.  And the top of the set list includes some early, lesser known songs of Taylor's.  In other words, this isn't an evening restricted to wrapping up in an afghan, sipping camomille tea, and stroking the cat, but rather revisiting a time and place -- the anxiety-ridden late '60s and early '70s -- when both artists' voices were heard in more complex settings than history has assigned them.  (Back then, Taylor wrote often of his time in a mental institution; King was breaking free of her Brill-Building pop roots with songs that included a guy gunning down a congregation.)  Still, the hits are here, but the great backing sound gives them much-needed new life, even as it harkens back to roots.  In short, there's something here for everybody, and it all seems effortless.  It's a terrific and welcome surprise from two artists who deserved this sort of release, because they earned their appreciative audiences.  It appeals across the spectrum.
B0035TUBIE|5.0|A friend of mine who was on a European tour this summer recommended Caro Emerald after seeing her live.<br />Actually, what she said was \\"You need to go ahead and download \\"That Man\\".  I have found a new band that I love, because it has everything:  pin-up girl singer, dj on the stage, and a band.  And it sounds a little like the Muppets\\".<br /><br />which is actually a fairly good description.  To me, all the music has a late-40s swing/early 50s club vibe to it, plus sort of a Fatboy Slim kinda thing going on. It's really great.<br /><br />And, \\"That Man\\" is oddly reminiscent of The Muppet Show opening theme.<br /><br />To me, that's a big bonus.<br /><br />I find these songs getting stuck in my head at odd times, but that's okay.  they're all pretty darn good.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0545123283|4.0|In \\"Linger,\\" the sequel to [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]], ex-werewolf Sam tentatively embraces his lost boyhood (manhood?) after being cured of his curse. As the spring thaw brings the first fragile crocuses to Mercy Falls, Minnesota, he rediscovers the trappings of humanity that he was forced to shed during the endless winters of his adolescence (cold weather triggered the seasonal shift to wolf). Meanwhile, his steadfast girlfriend Grace grows sicker by the day, dogged by a raging fever and constant stomachache and plagued by nightmares of becoming a wolf (\\"I choked on the wolf rising up inside me, pressing against the lining of my stomach, clawing inside my skin, trying to peel me inside out\\"). Grace had been smuggling Sam into her bedroom for chaste sleepovers, but when Sam is discovered in her bed, the two are forbidden from seeing each other.<br /><br />Grace's friend Isabel, still bitter from losing her brother Jack in \\"Shiver,\\" becomes involved with Cole St. Clair, one of the pack's newest (were)wolves. Cole is a bitter, angry young rock star hellbent on self-destruction, and takes delight in razor-edged remarks and infidelities. He and his ex-bandmate Victor are anomalies in the werewolf world; Victor shifts several times an hour despite warm temperatures, and Cole is unable to shift at will and can't make the change stick. He finds an unexpected ally in the wounded Isabel. The lives of Sam, Grace, Isabel and Cole are intertwined throughout the novel, and all four serve as narrators, with several narrators sharing each short chapter.<br /><br />The various narrations flow together fairly seamlessly and the silvery prose enchants, particularly the effective use of poetry by Rilke, Roethke, and Mandlestam, but \\"Linger\\" is plagued by some plot inconsistencies (continuity errors from \\"Shiver\\" that alter the story's timeline) and stretches where not much occurs. Cole, as one of the newest characters, is given a large share of the narrative, but comes across as two-dimensional for much of the story (given Cole's backstory, I found it hard to reconcile the depths of his personal agony with that of Sam, who had a much more disturbing childhood yet is much more well-adjusted). Also, a disturbing incident involving Isabel's father and one of the secondary characters seems forced (in the first book, the run-in with Tom Culpepper served an important plot purpose).<br /><br />Stiefvater has a talent for poetry and stark imagery that brings the woods (and her characters) to vibrant life. Overall, Linger is a gripping, well-written read that will delight fans of the supernatural (and fans of werewolves in particular). The ending is clearly left open for \\"Forever,\\" the third and final novel in the \\"Wolves of Mercy Falls\\" trilogy.much of the story (given Cole's backstory, I found it hard to reconcile the depths of his personal agony with that of Sam, who had a much more disturbing childhood yet is much more well-adjusted).

0307454541|2.0|Wow. Talk about a disappointment. (Note; SPOILERS in this review).<br />First off is the writing itself - clunky, expository, repetitive. Despite it being a translation (and a bad one at that), it''s clear that Larson is a better storyteller than he is a writer.<br />The book is WAY too long. Passages repeat themselves as the same information is delivered to us over and over. Dialogue scenes go on forever. And a 100 page anti-climatic denouement that could have been achieved in twenty.<br />What surprises me about the book is how many rabid fans it has despite all of the book's cliches.<br />A missing/possibly murdered 16 yr girl - who later turns up alive! Of course she's alive - its why a body was never found!<br />Martin is the killer - or course he's the killer - he was the only viable suspect the whole way through.<br />A sex dungeon! LOL!  Nazis! A Sexually demented incestuous billioniare family! Seriously? I Kept waiting for Blake Carrington to appear!<br />Plus, I kept waiting for a twist that never came... I kept waiting for suspense that never really delivered. I was propelled to finish it only because friends had raved about it... Granted Lisbeth is cool; but she is in less than half the book. Go figure...
0882847953|5.0|This is not a \\"so you want to rock\\" book you find at the music store chain, this is to drumming what sanding and joinery is to a woodworker. Anybody that calls themselves a drummer has this hurdle to climb, a must for a serious drummer.  My 1st teacher gave me this and \\"Stick Control\\" in the 1981 when I started taking drum lessons.  I wasn't sure why I was learning to swing when the trend was rock, but I soon found myself deconstructing every song into these patterns.  This book is written in jazz notation, meaning that it does not include the ride cymbal and hi-hat patterns in every bar.  You should be able to play all of these patterns with a swing ride (dotted eight note) and the hit-hat on 2 and four.  It sounds easy, but playing straight 8th or 16th notes on the left hand while swinging in triplet time on the right can really be frustrating.  Make sure to reverse your hands after you've mastered your dominant technique, this breaks the limb dependance. My teacher told me that I should be relaxed enough to be able to play all of these patterns and recite the gettysburg address at the same time.  This book unravels rhythm in a way that has been duplicated, but never matched over the years.
B00005CDNF|5.0|My favorite ABBA album I think.  So good to hear these great tunes again after all of my albums from the 70's were lost.  These people were truly talented in every musical way.  GREAT CD!!
1400164257|2.0|I am sure the story is great but I will need to get it in its printed format.  I could not get through the first diskette because of the narrator (Johnny Heller).  His voice is craggy, you cannot differentiate between the characters and his delivery of the funny/sarcastic/witty lines is flat. He's an audio award winner so I don't understand how his interpretation of this book is so bad.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I bought the film for my young nephews and I found myself really enjoying it. Jack Black was hilarious as Po the misfit panda who always wanted to learn Kung Fu and finally gets his chance which atarts out as disaster then he turns into a dragon master. I liked it as an adult, I think it's just like Beverly Hills Ninja only animated.
0156012197|5.0|The Little Prince is a character who, once he has asked a question, will not let it go until he has an answer. Also, he is from an asteroid, a planet as small as a house, and has tamed a flower there.

B000002ADT|5.0|For those of us in this \\"special club\\" of not only having a great ear for music but also obtaining an unwielding passion for pretty sounds, we probally all agree that this may be the best of them all.  In an accelerated world of constant innovation and a need for immediate gratification, it's nice to slow down a bit and reflect.  No matter if you are madly in love or fresh off of an epic heartbreak, this is an album you can melt into your environment and have these euphoric sounds transcend you into bliss.    Add all of this banter to the fact that the bulk of this album was drawn up right before the recording sessions and done on a first take, this was a great moment in music history.    Enjoy and share this wonderful album with all of those around you...
0393327345|4.0|I had read a lot of Palahniuk's work prior to reading Fight Club, which I would imagine is rare, as most people familiarize themselves with him after having seen the movie that is based on this book. I still think it's his best book to date.<br />It is much easier in the book to foresee the 'trick' ending, I think.
B000002R48|5.0|80 metal prog at it's best.  This is their first album, the production quality reflects this, but it is good.  Original lead singer Dominici sounds good.  Slightly more dated in the 80's sound than their subsequent work, but so was most things at that time.  Great album.
067960085X|4.0|What a charming and eccentric character Holly Golightly is! Capote manages to cram a decent amount of her history and characterization in such a slim novella. It's breathtaking, sucking you in and not letting go until the last word.<br />Indeed, all the short stories in this collection breathe with the life of the characters. The settings are wide and varied and described in a way that gives you a real picture in your head; not easy to do with a short story!<br />After reading this, I become more interested in Capote himself. What kind of upbringing must he have had to write on the topics of prostitutes in Haiti with the same aplomb as he does an impoverished little boy and his elderly friend?<br />This is the first book by Capote I've read, though I've seen \\"In Cold Blood\\" the movie and have intended to read that book for a while. I am now more likely to pick it up to read sooner, and also to get a hold of his other work.
0307454541|3.0|This is the first in the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larson, about a veteran reporter and a young, brash computer hacker with a photographic memory who team up to solve the forty-year-old mystery of a wealthy businessman's missing niece. If it sounds like your typically implausible, semi-clich&eacute; crime story, it's because it pretty much is. The writing is so-so. The characters are hit-and-miss. The plot is entertaining, I guess, but that's like leaving a Michael Bay movie and saying it had good explosions. It's a crime novel--it has to have a good plot.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a book snob or contrarian, I'm not sure why this book has received such hype. It's not bad--I just don't think it's nearly as remarkable as it's been made out to be. It definitely doesn't warrant the praise of craft or groundbreaking storytelling it has received. It's not as good as any of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter books, and not any better than James Patterson's Alex Cross books. And as Swedish crime fiction goes, I enjoyed Henning Mankell's Sidetracked much more than this. To each his own, I guess.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I'm just going to simply say what my title indicates. The action and story in this one is intense and gripping. I downloaded it off a site but now I'm gonna have to buy this blu ray for sure. This is going right next to Justice League: Battle of two worlds.
0307463745|5.0|Since Amazon suggests reviews be between 75 and 300 words in length (!), I will keep it relatively brief here (although I encourage you to read my full review in the link at the end of this review).<br /><br />But to summarise my thoughts about this book:<br /><br />I thought it was an excellent read. It's definitely not a step-by-step how-to book, but the book doesn't make the claim that it is. The book claims that it will present ideas and concept that will \\"rework\\" the beliefs you have about work. And it does precisely that.<br /><br />I've had a look at some of the negative reviews on here, and generally they seem to fall into these categories:<br /><br />1) Criticisms of the length.<br /><br />Yes, this book is somewhere around 288 pages long, and yes - if you consider the fact that a lot of white space is used and almost every second page is an illustration - it's probably more like 140 pages long. But that's not a bad thing. It's a quick, concise, and extremely coherent piece of work. There is value in not rambling. And there is also value in presenting text in an easy-to-read fashion (unlike typical hardcore business books that due to the publisher's page limitations, end up structuring pages like one huge wall of text ... *ugh*).<br /><br />2) Criticisms of the concepts not being grounded in \\"reality\\".<br /><br />I don't understand this criticism. The whole point of \\"Rework\\" is to challenge pre-existing assumptions about how we do business. Naturally, many of the book's concepts will be EXTREMELY difficult for some people to swallow (especially those coming from the corporate world, I suspect). You might feel quite a bit of resistance with some of the concepts. But again, that's the whole point of this book. You don't necessarily have to agree with EVERYTHING it says, but you should at least be questioning your existing beliefs after reading this. If you're not prepared to do that, and just want to read a book that confirms your traditional business concepts, then this is probably not the book for you.<br /><br />3) Criticisms about the lack of new content.<br /><br />This criticism is one that is only raised by those people who are REGULAR readers of 37 Signals' blog. Yes, if you do follow that blog closely (along with others in the same field), then it's possible that 90% of the concepts presented in this book are not going to be new to you. And that's cool. But speaking for myself, I liked the fact that I now have the best concepts on my reference shelf in easy to find (and digest) form whenever I need them. That, again, has value in itself. But if you want to spend hours searching through 37 Signals' blog just to save $12, then you're not implementing a \\"judo solution\\" (ie. maximum efficiency with minimum effort).<br /><br />For my complete review and summary of the book (containing some of the best highlights so that you can see for sure whether this book is something you'd like to read), please feel free to check out:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I hope it helps you decide whether or not this is the book for you. :)3) Criticisms about the lack of new content.

B00000IUT7|1.0|These were on mega sale at our local discount store, and my wife and I both purchased one thinking they would be fun.  However neither train can make it up a hill on Brio or other brand tracks.  Not even by itself.   The train is too long for the curve of the hill, first I tried adding traction to the hill tracks and it almost makes it, but the rubber tires spin, so I glued them, and now the wheels slip on the axle and it still can't get up the hill.    It's got a motor / free wheel switch which maybe is not gripping the axle well, but even if it did the tire slipping would cause a failure anyway.    Also the motor itself is incredibly loud, and has a tendency to run off the tracks.    Eventually I bough the Maxim - RC ENGINE, it makes it up hills with 4+ cars in tow.  Has a remote, and sound effects, and does not run off the track much; oh and at 1/4 the cost.  So much more fun, though my son does like to run the red BRIO ahead of the Maxim, it gets stuck and then the Maxim pushes it up the hill.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|While I agree with the majority - that Nip/Tuck isn't as good as it was in Seasons 1, 2, and possibly 3 - I'm sad that this show is over.  Even though the show didn't blow me away as it did in the first season, it's still exciting, shocking, and ridiculously enticing.  The series ended a little differently than I would have liked, but I won't put any spoiler alerts.  It was good that the characters all got the closure that they'd been looking for since episode 1, season 1.
0312370830|4.0|Sarah's Key is a beautiful haunting book that will stay with you long after you close the cover.  Author De Rosny has tackled a difficult and little known subject in the dark history of France.  On July 16, 1942, French police did the Nazi's dirty work by rounding up Jewish men, women and children and housing them in despicable condition in a velodrome.  Ten year old Sarah hides her brother in a secret cupboard when the French came banging on her door to take her family away.  The locking of the cupboard haunts Sarah for the rest of her life.  The author's style is one of my favorite, switching between Sarah's narration and the new mistress of the home.  Julia, is about to become the mistress of the home. Married to a Parisian, she writes for an expat magazine catering to Americans.  Her current assignment is to write about Vel D'Hiv.  Through her assignment she discovers that her husband's family home in the Marais, was Sarah's home.

B000VECAEO|5.0|Seinfeld is one of the best tv shows, period! Writing a review is really hard. Words cannot capture a 10 year sitcom. Every aspect of this sitcom is stunning. I got addicted  after watching few season 1 episodes.. This show was present in my life each week for the past 10 years. It relates to my past.. There are small little disappointments, not because of the show per-say, but the dvds.. Sound is only in stereo, and Sony did not make an effort to remaster original soundtrack into believable surround format. Sony has the tech  and experience to make it more believable, oh well maybe down the road they will reissue.   Cons  When you watch the show consecutively week after week you see characters to develop, and it gets better and better. I watched all seasons, and when you go back and watch first season you realize how much better rest of the seasons were.  In season 1 characters are all over the place, trying to build their  characters which evolved. Jerrys parents were different actors, and lame. The other beef I have is in season 6 original writers were replaced with new ones, and lost that spark. You can really see it in the rest of the episodes.    Set that a side this is part of Americana. They should give seinfeld dvd collection to every newborn.   AMAZING!!!!

0062513346|1.0|I have been told by many to read the ever-popular Coelho & picked up this book without knowing the others. It didn't matter. This sophmoric 9th grade homework essay was far from \\"a suspense novel\\" and even further from the angels in our lives. While I appreciate that this was a sort of memoir, the epilogue was much better than the entire preceding story, and if Paulo could have actually imbued his novel with those thoughts, ideas & story lines, well, it would have been a book to remember.<br />Unfortunately for readers, like Dan Brown, just because it's popular doesn't make it good literature. But at least Brown knows how to carry a story.  Just like Dan Brown, Coelho recklessly tosses in writerly fantasy, biblical quotes and half truths in order to give us a punishing God, devil worship, and a satanic ritual as he comes closer to experiencing the love of angels??<br />It's unfortunate that this writer has such an influence as his 'transformation' from the 'dark side' however superficially treated will still have an impact on people who will equate Jesus, Mary, Angels and God as anything other than LOVE.<br />Readers (and Coelho) who wish to know about angels and other New Age concepts would be better off picking up a copy of any of Deepak Chopra's books and, if you want a book that reveals one man's encounter with angels read Nick Bunick's The Messengers. [[ASIN:0671016865 The Messengers: A True Story of Angelic Presence and the Return to the Age of Miracles]]<br />While not great literature (although he doesn't pretend to be a writer like Coelho), Nick's story shows you can meet your angels without having to head to caves in the Arizona desert and commit sadistic acts.<br /><br />I wish Paulo and others who read this tome--good luck on your spiritual path, because if you start here, you will certainly need it.
0811821846|4.0|My 11 yo son loves Star Wars and is learning to cook. We stumbled across this book at our local library. He asked if we could purchase one. I found the first and second ones on Amazon at reasonable prices. Purchased both. He's made a few things from them, and has enjoyed reading both cookbooks. A must have for any dedicated Star Wars fan. (And a cool way to get boys interested in cooking, maybe.)

0307271862|4.0|The discovery of nineteen gruesomely murdered people in an isolated hamlet in Sweden has police baffled.  There is one clue: a red ribbon found in the snow.  Most of the victims are elderly, and many share a family name.  One of those family names is Andren.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sweden, Birgitta Roslin, a middle-aged judge recognises this name and believes that one of the murdered couples was her mother's foster parents. Birgitta Roslin becomes involved in the case, and finds a number of connections which she draws to the attention of the police.  The police treat much of Ms Roslin's information with polite disinterest and her interest in the case, combined with a number of extraordinary coincidences led Ms Roslin - and the reader - into a complex world of events, both historical and current, and vengeance.<br /><br />Events in nineteenth century China and Nevada carry the key and the action crosses the globe (Europe, China, Africa and America each feature) from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The shifts in action are not always chronological but are clearly delineated.<br /><br />For me, this novel is a curious blend of historical fiction, murder mystery and political comment.  To some extent, the murder mystery is overwhelmed by the history and politics.  By the midpoint of the novel, the only mystery about the murders is whether the police will actually solve the crime.  The readers know who did it and why but the solving of the crime - in the novel itself - has become secondary to broader global political issues and related history.<br /><br />I enjoyed the novel: the writing kept me turning pages even when elements of the story were not totally absorbing.  This is a novel that ultimately raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|I recently purchased Michael Jackson Moonwalker. This is one of the best DVDs of Michael that I've seen. First, I loved the cartoon part of it; it was funny!! Then the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" dancing was \\"Out of Site\\". Then it ends with Michael singing \\"Come Together\\", which I have never heard him sing. It was wonderful. I would highly recommend this DVD to any Michale Jackson fan. Check it out.

EVERYONE should read this book it is that good and is a study in every personality that we encounter in our lives IF we are lucky.  I laughed out loud continuously and dreaded finishing this book as I knew there were no others by this author.  I plan to re-read it again and again-  I never re-read books.  Norfolk Mermaid
B0019IB26I|2.0|Fantastic performances. Like many live albums, this suffers from poor audio engineering. The bass drum and the guitar go straight to a sub-woofer creating a tiring listening experience. Any bass guitar is hardly noticeable throughout the album, but should come through on a home speaker or sub-woofer. The level on John's guitar is low, keeping the melodies from shining through.    The 'sound' of this album really kills the ability to connect with the music.    I suspect that the DVD and Blu-Ray sound better on a home theater system. The audio CD on the other hand was not engineered well for home or car stereos. I plan to pickup the DVD with the hope that the experience come through.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter in general and Harry Potter movies in particular will love this set.  There's so much extra material that you'll need a special movie night to watch it all.  Having the choice of the theatrical version or the extended cut is wonderful as well.<br /><br />If you're interested enough in Harry Potter to check this out then I believe you could do no better than to get this set.<br /><br />The drawback?  We only get one a year after the release of one and two together.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|This production is so excellent that in order to appreciate fully its splendor it is necessary to look into history regarding the time it was premiered and at the composer's place in music, mainly in France. I would like to quote some great text from an important source:<br /><br />\\"\\"A very special sort of opera that would reign in France, one tailored to accommodate national prejudices, court traditions, and royal prerogatives. As the French court was the exemplary aristocratic establishment, so the French national opera was the courtiest court opera that ever was-- and hence the one most committed to the politics of affirmation. Like every other aspect of French administrative culture, it was wholly centralized. Its primary purpose was to furnish propaganda for the state and for the divine right of the king, and only secondarily to provide entertainment for the nobility and bourgeoisie. Indeed, no operatic spectacle could be shown to the French public that had not been prescreened, and approved, at court. At the same time, French opera aimed far higher than the \\"musical tale\\" of the Italians, which was essentially a pastoral play. The French form aspired to the status of a full-fledged trag&eacute;die en musique later trag&eacute;die lyrique, which meant that the values of the spoken drama, France's greatest cultural treasure, were as tar as possible to be preserved in spite of the music.<br /><br />To reconcile the claims of court pageantry with those of dramatic gravity was no mean trick. Only a very special genius could bring it off - and it happened to be Giovanni Battista Lulli, a Florentine boy who had been brought over in 1646, at the age of thirteen, to serve as garcon de chambreto Madame de Montpensier, a Parisian lady who wanted to practice her Italian. She also supported his training in courtly dancing and violin playing. When his patroness, a Frondist, was exiled in 1652, Lulli secured release from her employ and found work as a dancer and a mime at the royal court, where he danced alongside, and made friends with, the teenaged king. Upon the death of his violin teacher the next year, Lulli assumed his position as court composer of instrumental music. His rise to supreme power was steady and unstoppable, for Lulli was a veritable musical Mazarin, an Italian-born French political manipulator of genius. With the founding in 1669 of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Musique, Louis XIV's opera establishment (which the king shortly deeded over to his by then naturalized friend who, Like Mazarin, had Frenchified his name), Jean-Baptiste Lully became himself a musical Sun King, the absolute autocrat of French music, which he re-created in his own image. He died in 1687 (with his boots on, as it were, following a mishap with a time-beating cane), having produced thirteen tragedies lyriques.<br /><br />The pattern that he set with them became the standard to which any composer aspiring to a court performance had to conform. Two generations of French musicians thus became Lully's dynastic heirs. His works would dominate the repertory for half a century after his death, in response not to market forces or to public demand but by royal decree, giving Lully a vicarious reign comparable in length of years to his patron's, and extending through most of the reign of the next king, Louis XV. His style did not merely define an art form; it defined a national identity. La musique, he might have said, c'est moi.<br /><br />The ultimate \\"representation of power,\\" the Lullian tragedie lyrique was from first to last a sumptuously outfitted--but, in another sense, quite thinly clad--metaphor for the grandeur and the authority of the court that it adorned. The monumental mythological or heroic-historical plots, some at first chosen by the king himself, celebrated the implacable universal order and the supremacy of divine or divinely appointed rulers.<br />A metaphor from first to last. First, following a marchlike overture whose stilted rhythms became a universal code for pomp, there had to be a panegyric prologue of a full act's duration. Here mythological beings were summoned to extol the French king's magnificent person and his deeds of war and peace with choral pageantry and with suites of dances modeled on the actual ballet de cour, an elaborate ritual, in which the king himself took part, that symbolized the social hierarchy.<br /><br />Throughout the spectacle that followed, dancing, ceremonial movement accompanied by the grandest and most disciplined orchestra in Europe, would furnish a lavish symbolic counterpoint to the words, at times enlarging on the dramatic action, at times contrasting with it.  The contemporary relevance of the allegory proclaimed at the first and affirmed at the last, was what really counted in a trag&eacute;die lyrique. To drive it home the players wore \\"modern dress,\\" adapted from contemporary court regalia, just as the dances they danced were the sarabands, the gavottes, and the passepieds of the contemporary ballroom. The theatrical pageant was not merely reminiscent of a social dance; it wasa social dance enacted by professional proxies. The whole drama was conceived as a sublimated court ritual. Royal and noble spectators were looking not for transcendence but for validation. They did not value the kind of verisimilitude that makes the imaginary seem real. They wanted just the opposite: to see the real--that is, themselves--projected in to the fabulous and the archetypal.<br /><br />Along with this peerless feast of symbolic movement and rich sonority went an unparalleled courtly intolerance of virtuoso singing, abjured not only for the usual negative reasons--uppity singers symbolized a polity in disarray--but for more positive reasons having to do with the theatrical traditions of France. Here verisimilitude of a very particular sort--fidelity to articulate language, which is the first thing that goes in florid, legato, \\"operatic\\" singing--suddenly loomed very large. The lead performers in French court opera remained nominally acteurs, and the voice of the castrato went unheard.<br /><br />Rarely were French singing actors called upon to contend with the full orchestra. Their interminable scenes and confrontations were played against a bare figured bass in a stately, richly nuanced recitative whose supple rhythms in mixed meters caught the lofty cadence of French theatrical declamation. Lully for whom French was a second language, was said to have modeled this style directly on the closely observed delivery--the contours, the tempos, the rhythms, and the inflections--of La Champmesl&eacute;, Racine's handpicked tragedienne. There were no roulades and no cadenzas, but there were an infinity of \\"graces\\": tiny conventional embellishments--shakes, slides, swells-- that worked in harness with the bass harmony to punctuate the lines and to enhance their rhetorical projection. And there were all kinds of subtly graded transitions in and out of minuscule, simply structured \\"airs,\\" set in plain couplets to dance rhythms, that animated the prosody while placing minimum barriers in the way of understanding.<br /><br />This, in its way, was the perfect opera for opera haters: an eyeful of spectacle, one ear full of opulent instrumental timbre, the other ear full of high rhetorical declamation. Vocal melody was far from the first ingredient or the most potent one, and the singers were held forcibly in check. Vocal virtuosity was admitted only in a decorative capacity on a par with orchestral color and stage machinery--never as a metaphor of emotion run amok!--and had to emanate from the lips of anonymous coryph&eacute;es: members of the populace, shades, athletes, planets. The dazzling general impression took absolute precedence over the particular participants. The concert of myriad forces in perfect harness under the aegis of a mastermind was the real message, whatever the story. While even Saint-Evremond had to admit that \\"no man can perform better than Lully upon an ill-conceived subject,\\" he turned it into a barb: \\"I don't question but that in operas at the Palace-Royal, Lully is 1oo times more thought of than Theseus or Cadmus,\\" his heroes. But that was all right, since the king was even more thought of than Lully. \\"\\"<br /><br />We can see that this production perfectly abides by the rules prescribed to the opera by French culture at the time.  The costumes and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne so meticulously done in the period style, we can easily imagine ourselves in Versailles attending a performance, with the Sun King and the court present.  The text/libretto is so incredibly smart and moralizing; it is an example of the typical baroque mindset - rational, a wry humor, deep feelings alongside sophistication and wisdom.<br /><br />The singing is flawless; the acting is beautiful - the gestures, the ballet - such a perfection, and of course, it has a healthy dose of fun - the whole dragon affair is so entertaining, and surely inspires many smiles.<br /><br />Of course, the allegory here is for the France confrontation with Holland in 1672; it seems as the defeated dragon is an allegory of Prince William III of Orange, who had been forced to raise the siege of Charleroi on 22 December.  Needless to say, Louis is represented by Apollo, his traditional allegorical divinity, and the references to the bright sun in whose rays people warm are to Sun King himself.<br /><br />The music is often so reminiscent of Monteverdi; to me the resemblance was the most striking in the duet of Cadmus and Hermione Act II, Scene IV \\"Je vais partir, belle Hermione\\" - toward the end when Hermione asks Cadmus to stay: \\"Vous fuyez?\\", the music  reminds of a similar part of the Poppea and Nerone duet, where Poppea asks Nerone when he would come again: \\"Tornerai?\\".<br /><br />My only wish would be that a libretto is included in DVD package, as it is commonly done in CDs.<br /><br />Overall, it is the highest quality production and I highly recommend it to baroque opera lovers.eurs, and the voice of the castrato went unheard.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|So far, I have not seeing a 'opera-film' version better than this.<br /><br />The acting of Mr. Villazon and Ms. Netrebko are both top-notch, or, they are more than just an opera stars could usually done.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for the sound engineering people. It is actually very difficult to doubling and synchronizing the sound of studio recording and the 'real' environmental sound. It is technically massive work. Also the camera people have done a great job on the same matter. (there are only couple of seconds that I found the picture of singers 'mouth' not quiet together with the music).<br /><br />Because it was sound recorded (the singing part) at studio quality, and it combines with 'film' (like soundtrack) taste of sound (usually a little brilliant than the live opera or concert version of sound), and the view angles are 'optimized' from the directors view, it all summed up to a wonderful experience of this opera.<br /><br />Puccini's music are extremely melodic. I find hard to not be touched by his arias, almost 'too' romantic for me to take, but I have felt it all.<br /><br />The orchestra sounds brilliant!<br /><br />I think later I will watch a 'real' opera of La Boheme, to just feel the difference from this one.<br /><br />p.s. I found only in operas, people can 'talk' and 'sing' at the same time but with totally different stuff. Even the modern visual form such like TV, Movies and not doing that. Think, in most movies, have you ever seeing a dialog going on talking about one thing WHILE another dialog with totally different subject? But, in the second act of this opera. When mimi and Rodolfo were saying how they don't want to be apart WHILE marcello was yelling at his lover Musetta. But, four of them are singing together at same time with same music. I think it is amazing, and it doesn't always happens in movies or TV shows. I think modern form of visual arts are more like 'monologue' in this matter --- one time one subject.
0307454541|1.0|Wow, maybe I'm just not the right person for this book.  Maybe the plot is interesting - but the writing is AWFUL.  Could be the translator's fault, but I doubt it.  The endless, overly detailed descriptions of items is really annoying.  I don't care what brand tape recorder, scanner, or computer the subjects use.  It does not advance the plot and just gets annoying.  Why is it there?  Second, the characters are utterly unbelievable.  The idea that Lisbeth would be so bright in investigation and research and not apply any of those skills to her own situation is absurd.<br /><br />Frankly, this was one of the worst books I've ever read.

Gets very loud on low settings and the gain and tone controls can be dialed to create a multitude of textures - everything but clean.  And who wants to be clean when you can be so very, very dirty and make sounds that break things and cause small fires?    I especially like that the Vox amPlug Metal Guitar Headphone Amp lets all of this sharp, crisp gore and carnage issue forth from the guitar without disturbing my family and neighbors.

0385504225|4.0|It seems to me most everyone that has reviewed this book are pompous a-holes who are jealous that people read Dan Browns words instead of theres. Word of advice, make a review short and sweet. When you start numbering a review 1-10 point by point dissecting this book telling how Brown should have done \\"this\\" or \\"that\\" you look like an idiot.     This book is good. If you enjoyed Brown's other works you will enjoy this one.     If you are only reading Brown's books to find faults, get a day job. His books are full of inconstancies and embellished fact. Everyone already knows that. No need to write a 1000 word review explaining EVERYTHING that you dislike about the book. His books are meant to get you to THINK and for your ENJOYMENT. If you buy this book to look like a fool and criticize it on Amazon YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

B003DO13NS|5.0|I've always loved this piece of music even though it's a little \\"uneven\\". It has a few short sections that are tad on the abrasive side and I feel maybe a little more time and less pressure at the time to get something on the market would have resulted in a better LP. But it certainly has sections that are really nice. The original pressing was not good either back in the 70's and I remember returning it the store to get a refund and getting another one only to discover it was the same. The vinyl was noisy and scratchy sounding, not to mention it was very thin. I eventually replaced it with Cd and that also left more to desire. Parts were too soft and parts were too loud. Finally this is all corrected and I definately recommend this CD. I love it. I sure wish that it'd have been released like this the first time.
B003DO13OM|5.0|This 2010 release is worth every penny. Ommadawn has always been my favorite piece by Mike Oldfield...and this 2010 release is even more beautiful. I love it and highly recommend it. My only regret is that it wasn't relaesed like this the year it came out.

The books do become a bit redundant if you buy the series, however while he tends to repeat himself on occasion from book to book, it is likely for those that only buy one of his series.   So for you out there only looking to buy one of his books your in luck however I would highly recommend the series.

Great little slumber party movie for young girls...as long as they don't do any of the shenanigans from the movie while they're sleeping over!<br /><br />Great acting and chemistry--Lindsey Lohan was so fresh and funny in the role as twins.  Natasha Richardson was lovely in this and the whole cast works so well together.  Romance, humor, pranks, and good old summer camp (and camping) fun.  Add it to your list of light movies.
0060752610|1.0|I'm very disappointed with this book not for the content that was being written but by the outlook of the book. How could the publisher even allows book that was so badly cut in pages out on the shelves or to the hands of the consumer? The edges of my book pages seems to be cut by some really blunt paper cutter!

If you have a dark sense of humor or are a comic book geek, this is your kind of movie. If you are a huge fan of family films by Eddie Murphy, Tim Allen, and Kevin James, you might want to pass on this one.
B000002UEB|5.0|Although my favorite band has always been Iron Maiden, I have to admit that even they never produced an album as good as Operation MindCrime. This simply is the best album ever made by any band and is only rivaled by Pink Floyd's The Wall. Every song on the album fits neatly and tightly together with the other songs to form a cohesive whole, yet each song can also be pulled out from the mix to stand on its own. This is coming from someone who isn't even a huge QR fan. Everyone should listen to this at least once in their lifetime.

This is exactly what the main charater did to her former husband...I'd say \\"the poor soul\\" but he's really a VERY lucky man to not have to put up with this whiny, selfish, self-indulgent brat any longer.    Save your money. Don't buy the book and don't see the movie, much as I love Julia Roberts. It's only feeding the \\"all about me\\" machine that is Liz Gilbert. Yuck!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  Coldplay is easily turning out to be one of my favorites.  My first Coldplay CD was Viva la Vida, and I love every song on that CD - I even used Strawberry Swing in my wedding.  I've been working my way back through their CDs since.  I've always loved their singles on the radio, so I decided to pick up their most recent CD when I couldn't get enough of that song \\"Viva la Vida\\".  Anyway.... I can listen to their entire CD all the way through without wanting to change any of the songs.  Perfect music to write to or work to or chill to, well, you get the idea.  Lets just say they're a big deal for a reason.  Those Brits know a thing or two about music.
3836503050|4.0|This book is a fine example period art.  The plates while some could argue that they are too racy, are rather a look at beauty and fashion of the time period represented. The models and the artist both show in most instances, a whimsical, playful innocence that is not availiable in modern art.  These plates are high quality and very enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to anyone studying art or history.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I first saw Inception when it opened at Midnight at my local movie cinema.  The only thing I knew about it was that it was about dreams and what it would be like if you could invade those of others.  I also knew that a movie with this kind of premise couldn't possibly be simple and easy to follow; especially considering it was directed by Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan.  The year before, The Dark Knight just about revolutionized what a comic-book film could be like.  Instead of simply telling the story of a super-hero's quest for good, Nolan put equal weight on the villain (in this case, Heath Ledger's legendary \\"Joker\\") and created something that was fresh and had lasting power in the world of film.  Now, with his latest project, Christopher Nolan once again creates a masterwork that will almost certainly stand the test of time as well as be imitated for years to come.    This film is, quite simply, one of the most original and unique I've seen in years.  As stated before, Inception is a movie about dreams.  Like dreams, the movie's story is full of mystery, surrealism, and unpredictability.  Not only are the scenes and special effects outrageous, but the very structure of the plot is avant-garde and requires one to pay close attention to it.  This isn't the kind of movie you can just skim through; you have to be watching for every detail since each one is important to the film's story and overall outcome.  An example of this film's complexity is the concept of time which is distorted in several sequences, and there are even instances where several layers of \\"storyline\\" literally overlap each-other.  Indeed, in a era where many films are often simple-minded and even downright dumb, this film is a breath of fresh air.  It's a wonder that such an intelligent film was even understood by a crowd that craves such stuff as The Hangover and Transformers 2.    Perhaps one of the reasons this film has been so successful is not just its top-notch plot and direction but also its incredible cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance here as an agent who makes a living stealing valuable information from other people's minds.  But when he is hired by a businessman (Ken Wantanbe) to do the opposite and actually implant an idea into someone head, he must design a mission so elaborate that he must rethink everything he knows about his line of work.  One of his new recruits is a young architect played by Ellen Page.  Page adds a nice dose of youthfulness in a film mostly played by veteran actors.  Also present is Nolan regular, Michael Caine who works his usual magic as an old intellectual and Marion Cotillard who plays a darn good femme fatal of sorts.  Aside from the acting, everything else from the art direction to the musical score is near perfect.  There is very little that could be said about this film's weaknesses.    Despite what some critics say, this film does gain a very firm emotional grip on its viewers.  I can't say much more about this because it would spoil the experience.  Simply put, you have to see this film to understand what the deal is.  For me, films like this are what the movie-going experience is all about.  You want to have your mind challenged by a sharp, clever plot and you also want to experience feelings and emotions without the pain you would receive if a real-life event caused them.  I left the theater that night perfectly satisfied with what I had seen.  When this movie comes out on DVD, this will make an excellent gift for not just Sci-Fi buffs, but any serious film viewer.
0345495004|2.0|This book was boring.  The writer takes us along a poetic meandering of bad choices.  I found this book very hard to finish and did put is aside for a few weeks.
1591843162|4.0|The world of learning and work has changed, but for the most part we continue to use old solutions to address new challenges. This is the setup for Seth Godin's \\"Linchpin\\" which is his plea for us to not be cogs in the machinery anymore.<br /><br />A linchpin (a worker, learner AND artist) is one who is indispensable within her life network. This could be where you work, where you volunteer, where you go to school or even at home. Those who continue to contribute solely by following the instructions of others are seeing their value decline unforgivably. The world has changed and those who can navigate without a road map are the future leaders.<br /><br />Moreover, as Godin explains, the linchpin will be an unconditional gift-giver. Giving to others above and beyond what you're paid to do will make your own contributions unique and allow for a human connection that business interactions often seriously lack.<br /><br />I recommend giving this book as a gift to someone in your life who craves more humanity in their world of work.

B003TOS93O|5.0|No need to rerelease this again, this one is just plain perfect! The sound quality is awesome on this! But since the remastering was supervised by Pete Townshend, no doubt I wouldn't be disapointed! Even though not all of the tracks are on the DVD such as \\"1921,\\" \\"Amazing Jorney/Sparks,\\" \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me,\\" \\"Smash The Mirror,\\" and \\"Substitute,\\" probably due to lack of footage which is not uncommon back then, the whole thing is here on this 2 CD set in the actual order! Probably one of the finest Who live sets, if not the finest! No Who fan's CD rack is complete without it!<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen... THE 'OO! ;)

0316067938|5.0|I simply could not put this book down !  This past month was the first time I watched/read anything Twilight related. I am totally hooked! Therefore I watched Twilight, New Moon, & Eclipse all within a week timeframe.  The suspense for next movie was killing me so I went and purchased Breaking Dawn.  I have always been a huge reader, but to read 754 pages in 72 hours....I must say I've out done myself this time.  I could read this book again & again !
B002AF4Y96|1.0|I should of followed what one of the people said on here before because I would of never had to return this Blu-Ray. Basically this Blu-Ray has the worst transfer I have ever seen, the picture hops up and down throughout the entire film! I contacted Warner Brothers about this issue and of course I never got back a response. Save yourself money and do not buy this edition of Natural Born Killers!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I thought I was getting a good deal, when I ordered the rechargeble swivel sweeper. Unfortunately, the good deal was for the vendor that sold me the sweeper. When I received the sweeper, I tried charging the battery, with no luck. In fact, the charger got so hot, that it almost melted. I discovered that the battery was corroded and would not charge. The return policy of the vendor was so impossible to follow, that I just accepted it as money lost. I don't think the problem was the product, but the vendor selling a broken product, and not having a valid return policy.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|If you learned anything from IM-1, wait out the credits; never leave a theater as soon as a movie is over.........you never know what will be revealed.   I went to our local $3 theatre for this and, man, I thought I'd go deaf from the heavy metal tracks and sound effects- maybe with a theatre full of people the sound was absorbed, but there were only 3 other people with me and it was LOUD! Robert Downey Jr. was fabulous as usual and I enjoyed seeing Mr. Favreau 'beef up' his own screen presence in the sequel.  Good casting all around; can't remember why they re-cast the part with Mr. Cheadle, but he did a fine job.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|The Lungs CD from Florence and the machine is very energizing. The songs seem very personal to Florence. Her voice is very strong and beautiful.
B003ODL004|4.0|Hans Zimmer is a minimalist when it comes to creating motifs. Just like his co-score of The Dark Knight, Inception is no exception. Still, as I listened to the score while driving to work for about a week, it grew on me. Track #1, \\"Half Remembered Dream\\" has that simple, ominous opening that wets your appetite for more. Then there are high-speed action tracks like #3 \\"Dream Is Collapsing\\" which get your adrenalin pumping (my favorite type of tracks). However, the most memorable track for me is the chase scene track #7, \\"Mombasa\\"... it really gives you the sense that  your in high gear, the clock is ticking, but nothing can stop you from accomplishing your task at hand. I like to listen to it before I play a local league soccer game to pump me up and envision myself scoring goals, etc.<br /><br />Of course, fast-paced action tracks are only have of the overall score. There's the slow, and pensive motif for Mal and Cobb's scenes, best exemplified in the last track titled \\"Time\\". It speaks perfectly for the scenes it covers... of old memories, a life lost, and the lure of being trapped in the past at the expense of 'reality'.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great score. Simple, but great. It helps if you're a fan of the Batman Begins and The Dark Knight scores, but this a score that can stand on its own--powerful, energetic, and pensive... filled of emotion.
1559408855|2.0|If you've seen Saw, you've seen worse than this.  I love Pasolini's Medea, so, when you add in the legendary status this film boasts, I was really looking forward to something amazing.  Of course, what was shocking in the pre-Saw, Hostel, etc., etc. world doesn't shock as much anymore.  The flat performances do little to help this extremely dated seeming film.  While the shot composition was obviously a point of lavish attention, often the tableaux are textbook exercises with no real joy in them - and are even repetitive and predictable.  To me the film comes off simply pretentious, flat, poorly acted, and vaguely nauseating in a way that annoys without shocking.  Caligula is a much better and even more transgressive film, even without the scat play which figures so prominently in this film.  If you're wanting something that titillates, yet is more effective as a tragedy, I would recommend that film instead.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|What a disappointment. After 5 years of build-up weaving incredible mysteries and all that hype, the writers had nothing, but a \\"Oh look, there's Chuck E. Cheese\\" ending. They wasted half the season on the meaningless Flash Sideways world and answered little to nothing of the mysteries they utilized to keep us coming back for 6 years. Talk about a Long Con!!!!  Darlton should be vilified and never allowed near a TV or Motion Picture script again.    Best thing they can do with this Show is lock it away in the famous Disney-Vault for 20 or 30 years and then pawn it off as \\"Nostalgia\\".
0061673730|2.0|OK, maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I actually enjoyed the idea of the cross-country motorcycle ride, the details about motorcycle mechanics, and especially the portrayal of the narrator's relationship with his son. The son was the best part of the whole book. Unfortunately, there wasn't much space for sonny, because dad was too busy advertising the author's brilliant philisophical insights. Even more unfortunately, the insights weren't brilliant, and consumed hundreds of tedious pages. It occured to me to wonder whether the author was trying to make the point that the narrator was a pompous idiot; however, the intent seemed to be for the reader to be blown away by the brilliance of the narrator's philosophical insights, and hence by the brilliance of the author who conceived of the narrator and the philosophical insights. I can't believe I made it through 380 pages of this.
B0025KVLV0|2.0|This album has two giant faults which are cheesy production and a lack of great songs. There are a few bright and charming moments, but those are heavily outweighed by uninspired numbers like \\"For You Blue\\" and production massacres of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe.\\" No number of excuses or explanations can write away these fundamental problems with Let it Be. It's just not very good.
0393061310|2.0|The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made Moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals. Of course he is mostly right, but why is this considered such an Earth shattering idea, and why does he have to be so BORING about it? He uses basic principles of evolution to argue that the places you think of as \\"developed\\" today are so becuase of basically a geographical advantge thousands of years ago that allowed food production to be centralized such that individuals and tribes could stop being migratory and start to settle. Honestly if you have taken a basic evolution course you do not need to waste your time with this book, and if you have not taken an evolution course, you would find one much more interesting than this book. It is a simple concept which he boringly drones on about for hundreds of pages.
B0025KVLSI|2.0|\\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" and the best of the originals on this album, in that order.     \\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,\\" \\"Rock 'n Roll Music,\\" and \\"Everybody's Trying to be My Baby,\\" are the best of the covers, also in that order.     This album was made during a time when the Beatles were exhausted, and is one of the Beatles worst albums.    However, the album artwork on the cover is fantastic; very honest and gritty.
1573229725|5.0|Second Read Review<br />This book is even better the second time around. Didn't realize that some of the twists had me a bit twisted after the first read.  The love story and the heartlessness of many of the characters is what stood out on my second read. The book definitely outshines the movie.  Its depth of love and redemption is incredible. Watching the movie you can see love with your eyes, but reading the inner feelings of a character makes you a participant and not just an observer.<br /><br />\\"I don't like to be startled. I don't like to lose my place\\"<br /><br />First Read Review<br />Author Sarah Waters has written a crafty, at times poetic, story about the many complicating ways of feminine love.  A story of two orphan girls raised in households as different as city from country, when a twist of fate brings them together as young ladies.<br /><br />I came to the book Fingersmith months after seeing the movie version.  And as with many books adapted to the screen, this one gives so much more of the little details that makeup its desperate characters and their dire circumstances.  If ever a book quenched the thirst of a reader who'd already seen the film version, Fingersmith is that book.<br /><br />Set in a time when men's truths and falsehoods determine a woman's station in society, Fingersmith touches on the restrictions of women in 1860's Victorian England as well as the hidden taboos of men.  Ms. Waters convincingly writes as if she'd lived in the place and time of this story, a time of Gentlemen and Rogues, Ladies and .....Fingersmiths.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this book, full of twists and unexpected turns, are the supporting cast of characters and the seasoning they give to each serving.  The author masterly uses the supporting characters to dress the story and enlighten the reader along the way while advancing the plot that's being played out by the main characters.  Yes, very tastefully done!<br /><br />\\"His own voice is low, tremulous, complaining, like the shadow of a shivering man.\\"  (This quavering quote from Fingersmith is an eleven-year old girl's extraordinary thought as she's being evaluated by a coldly calculating gentleman)complaining, like the shadow of a shivering man.\\"  (This quavering quote from Fingersmith is an eleven-year old girl's extraordinary thought as she's being evaluated by a coldly calculating gentleman)
B0025KVLU6|2.0|This album has good songs (\\"I'm So Tired\\"), novel songs (\\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?\\"), and just plain ole ugly songs (\\"Wild Honey Pie\\").     There is little to no flow from song to song. It plays like a mixtape, which is not desireable when the product is toted as an album, and one of the greatest of all time, at that.     But even throwing all exceptations and hyperbole aside, it's still sketchy. Mediocore. Flat out boring and tedious in some parts. \\"Revolution 9\\" is, frankly, disturbing and self-important, and should have never made it onto anyone's album.     But turning the focus to talk about the things that are positive...  \\"Dear Prudence\\" is uplifting and sunny. \\"Julia\\" is one of Lennon's most beautiful, and poetic numbers. \\"Blackbird\\" is a fantastic ballad, with catchy and skillful guitar playing. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is a great song in and of itself, and also inspired \\"Paranoid Android\\" by Radiohead which is arguably just as great. \\"Helter Skelter\\" flat-out rocks, no more needs to be said. \\"I'm So Tired\\" has an interesting song structure, and dynamic vocals from Lennon. \\"Yer Blues\\" is a good song with a terrible title, which does detract from it a little.     Now let's take a look a couple of the novelty songs from this album...  \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?\\" is the best of them, because it's the least novel, and most explosive. One minor complaint is only that it's too short, and very sparse. The recording feels more like a demo, but the song itself is great. \\"Back in the USSR\\" is runner up, and is one of the funnest Beatles songs ever written. It's unfortunate that Paul McCartney reinvisioned it as being some kind of social gesture of goodwill to the USSR in his Live in Red Square DVD. It's a silly song based off Chuck Berry and the Beach Boys, and it's difficult to believe it has any greater meaning than that.      The remainer of the songs range from pleasantly boring and harmless (\\"I Will\\") to horrendous (the aforementioned bane known as\\"Wild Honey Pie\\").     The White Album would have been better released as a single album, but since it can only be judged as a double, it doesn't score high. It gets 2 stars.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|Bought this only for peter Steele  no.18, last track, Enemy of the state.It's worth the money just for that .All you girls still in love with Peter Steele, you wont be disappointed.Great guitar solo near end too.
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|When the Beatles were creating this album, they all knew very well that it would probably be their last. This both adds and detracts: it adds well-polished playing and production, yet detracts from the longetivity and out-of-context likability.    A good album should be able to stand on it's own two feet with little to no explanation. Can Abbey Road truly pass this test, and be good on its own merits, and not the merits of the band? Song-by-song, the truth will be revealed.     The first track is \\"Come Together.\\" It has strange lyrics, and is very enjoyable.    \\"Something\\" is a truly great song, very well done.    \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" ... Yikes. While this song may cause some uncomfortable giggling on first listen, it has no longetivity or artistic merit whatsoever.    \\"Oh! Darling\\" is not a very creative song. It's just a reboot of a traditional 50s rock 'n roll. That being said, it is a great vocal by McCartney, just not a great song in and of itself.    \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is not a great track whatsoever. Sung by anyone except Ringo, it would be perceived as awful. Ringo has enough charm to keep the song somewhat afloat, but it's not a classic or fantastic by any means.     \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is spotty... it has great moments, and then some really boring ones (like the pretentious, overly long ending).    \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is, along with \\"Something\\" the best two individual tracks on Abbey Road. Once again, well done, Mr. Harrison.     \\"Because\\" is an amazing number... not a whole lot can be said beyond that.    \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" features some great guitar riffs by Harrison. Lyrically, it's a bit of a drag to listen to. Some of the financial troubles of the Beatles seep through here. Overall, it's a very good song though.     \\"Sun King\\" is a decent song, but a bit awkward in it's track placement. The vocals are nothing to write home about, but the pleasant guitar and bass make it listenable.    \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\"are not great by any means.    \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" is harmless, but not incredibly impressive.     \\"Golden Slumbers\\" features a fantastic vocal from McCartney, a shame the song isn't longer though.    \\"Carry That Weight\\" has a very nostalgic feel to it. It sounds like something is coming to an end here (and not just the album).    \\"The End\\" has some great guitar solos, but the final lyrical line feels a bit too contrived.    \\"Her Majesty\\" is McCartney in a nutshell; cheeky and fond of all things novel.      For every moment on this album that feels good, there is a moment that is contrived or forced. The album is average. It's neither the Beatles worst or greatest. It's very middle of the road. It seemed like the Beatles were running out of ideas by the time they got to this album so perhaps, it was for the best that the Fab Four moved on with their lives after this one.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|The DVD (and CD) \\"A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle\\" is outstanding musical entertainment for most ages. When viewed on today's large screen TV and surround sound, Celtic Women come alive in the grandeur of stage performances of a very talented orchestra, which support vocal and instrument talents of Celtic Women.  If you should have only one of the Celtic Women DVD's, this is the very best.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|It's good for the current price (which is substantially below a c-note).  If you like the looks of the Daytona, you will like the looks of this watch.  The bracelet is good for this price class, but not great; I have a couple of Swiss Legend watches in the same price class with superior bracelets.  There is a bit of rattle to the bracelet due to the cheap, stamped clasp.  The Japanese quartz movement is typically accurate for a quartz.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|The previews for this movie looked good and made me think it was going to be all about Brad Pitt and his people going around killing nazi's. Nope, all this movie really is about is a girl who's family was killed by a nazi leader when she was younger then she grows up to own a movie theater. The nazi's are in town and want to watch a a nazi movie at her theater. The girl then plans to trap all the nazi's in the theater and kill them by blowing up the theater. This movie really has nothing to do with the Inglourious Basterds and they are rarely even needed for the movie. Bottom line save your time and go save the planet or something because after you waste about 2 1/2 hrs. of this bull you'd wish you had.
B003UYUQZW|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really, REALLY did-but for a movie that features pretty much wall-to-wall action-it's kinda boring.  It's not like they did anything wrong here-production values are good, the acting is decent, the story is okay, I just couldn't get into it.  Perhaps if you were made to care about the characters a little more instead of the characters being so one dimensional it might have been better.  It's kind of hard to say.  This was one of the movies I was most looking forward too this summer and it just really didn't deliver.  I did buy the soundtrack though, because personally, I thought the score was the highlight of the movie.   That should tell you something.

One of the best this year IMO.!
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|I ordered this when it went on sale thinking that it was a great bargain.  I think at $0.99 I may have overpaid.  I didn't find it to be that good of a read, with the exception of the last few chapters when the main character is finally figuring things out.  I found Rebecca to be a frustrating character, but then I don't have a passion for the newest, most expensive clothes, nor do I max out my credit cards without being able to make the payments.    All-in-all, it was just ok.  I wouldn't read it again though, nor will I bother with the rest of the series.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Some of you guys and gals may have read 1984, Animal Farm, Brave new world, or Fahrenheit 451, and we all know they pull off the genre 'dystopian' magnificentely. Let me tell you people, this movie fits that genre perfectly.<br /><br />Thought-provoking, intense, and confusing for the undereducated, this movie has its twists and turns, and if you're one of those paranoid people that's afraid the government is watching you, this is the movie for you. Originally Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel before this movie even came out, but he doesn't like the notorious hollywood all too well to have his name listed as the writer.<br /><br />The two main characters share an interesting relationship, and government is in more of a national socialist form in this movie, yet it also constitutes stereotypes and ethnic hate, something...hmm... some governments do today! This movie will make you realize there are people out there that will rise up against the masses for what they believe is right and wrong, and let me tell you folks, the power that one vigilante can do to influence a whole nation, he opened their eyes to the corruption and immorality their government held with it.<br /><br />It also makes us realize that the word 'terrorist' is thrown around excessively, if someone earns this title by simply standing up for what they believe in, and let's just say anyone hearing that word labeled to someone is not only a stereotype, but it makes a default hate for anyone who hears it about this person.<br /><br />All in all, this movie makes me think of what could be, what is and what could have been of this world. And what creates the chaos and hate of this world. Watch it, it's an awesome movie.
0142410349|3.0|While the book is written well, the plot clear and the pages a breeze to read, the ending is a bit weak.  Dahl ends the tale rather abruptly, without really a climax or a denouement, leaving you with somewhat of a \\"that's it?\\" feeling.  It's nevertheless an interesting story, but certainly not one of Dahl's best.  \\"The Enormous Crocodile\\" ([[ASIN:0142414530 The Enormous Crocodile]]) is better and funnier.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|I won't rehash the plot, but rather simply say that \\"Stardust\\" was a pleasure to watch.  While it borrows a lot of fantasy elements you've probably seen already, it invents (or introduces) quite a few of its own.  It's quite amusing at times and visually impressive, to boot.  While Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer do very good jobs in their respective roles, they--particularly De Niro--didn't exactly fit, possibly due to their American accents.  Claire Danes, however, does a masterful job, regardless of the fact that she was born in NYC.

0553381687|5.0|These are really stellar novels.  I won't get into the books too much, because you can look at the other 1600 or so reviews for that.  But I will say the prose is flawless and the storytelling is great.  To be fair, if you really cannot stand when a main character dies, you should avoid these books.  I thought that it really helped the storytelling, personally.

B002SEW5WW|5.0|I'm usually skeptical about artists whose songs get over-played on the radio. OneRepublic is definitely worth the hype, though. His combination of hip-hop and orchestral sounds are a welcome change and the next step in the evolution of pop and hip-hop sound. Also one of the few artists I've heard whose higher voice avoids whining or squeaking. Highly recommended!

030726999X|5.0|I am extremely sad that there evidently will be no more books with Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />Hate to say it but I passed on the books for awhile because of the fact that they were Swedish and translated to English.  I finally purchased the first book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" in desperation while I was camping.  I could not put the book down until I could not stay awake any longer.  I have now  read all three books in the trilogy, and will save them to read again some day.<br /><br />I simply have found no other mysteries any more rewarding nor enjoyable since I discovered James Crumley many many moons ago.
B000AP04OM|5.0|My granddaughter has the lead in a local theatre groups production this fall. The theatre company had a VHS version of the movie for study, but I saw this 2-disc version and thought it would give a deeper appreciation of it.  Sure enough, my granddaughter was thrilled and has influenced other actors in the play to also get copies for themselves.  It's wonderful, as always!

B003S897U0|3.0|Some may not agree, but as a Crowes fan I was disappointed with this release. If you look at the songs and think you're going to hear the same band that made them famous in the 90s, you're mistaken. I was looking forward to hearing the bluesy, rock n roll band that had so much energy and power in their songs. Unfortunately what they have hear is the \\"new\\" crowes sound playing mellow, folksy versions of their classic tunes and covers. If that's what you're looking for and prefer that sound then buy the cd, but if you're like me and thought you'd be hearing some kick ass versions of these songs done an an acoustic setting you will probably be disappointed. I love the Crowes so much, I have every single b-side and cover they ever played, and I find myself trying and trying to enjoy their new sound but it just isn't the same.

1931788340|5.0|So far the most enjoyable photography book out of the 3 I've handled and viewed about 70's artist. Prior to this book I acquired \\"New Topographics\\", the commemorative book of the then \\"novel\\" style, where I discovered Shore. Shore is a true master of color and composition, with his clean, neat, clever, delicate & fine style.    For lovers of New Topographics and color photograpy this book is a must.     So many plates, so beautiful, so varied (topographics, objects and interiors, portraits...)... browsing and watching the book for the first time was such a pleasant photo bombardment. The adecuate size of the book and the prints within (27 cms x 20 cms) contribute to deepen the experience. Very nice finish with white background for both the inner pages and the hardcover. Dustcover photos excel too.    Highly recommendable, this book is a must
0525421580|5.0|Will(s), Tiny, Jane, Maura. . . all kept me company the past few nights of insomnia.  I have to say - they made the sleepless nights and groggy days worth it. A lovely story with so many spot-on observations about love and authenticity that really resonated with me.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have just finished reading this and had to make a quick comment; this is one of the best books I have read in my 55years of age.  It is really addictive so when you pick it up to read it plan on being involved in it until you finish it.  I can not wait to read the next two books.  To those of you who shy away from books that may have some violence please do not shy from this one it is not the gist of this book; it is truely unique and well worth the time to pick up and enjoy.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|It was exceptional. The acting was too real. I'm familiar with the story of the writer of the song Amazing Gace. It was well done.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|A wonderful start to another Doctor.    Could have been better, but it was excellent acting and fun situations.  Writing started of very well and slid backwards toward the end (aside from the awful Dalek Story) when the show became more like the past few series.  Steven Moffatt's abilities were stuck more on strong situations and a little less on logic of the stories.  The acting and characters were warm and welcoming.  Smith's Doctor was an old man in a younger body and came off as someone that is more like Doctors prior to 1980.    If this is a progressive step, the next years could be the best since Tom baker left the series.  Let's hope so.
B0000844I8|3.0|Fewer movies start out with more promise.<br /><br />It is 1928 and gigantic and mysterious objects are found in the desert.<br /><br />OK. I am fully engaged.<br /><br />Fast forward to today. A total Egyptology nerd is shown presenting evidence supporting his (controversial) theories about the famous pyramids. The audience walks out.<br /><br />The nerd, dejected, broke, and homeless, is offered a dream job by what seems an impossibility: a person who takes him seriously.<br /><br />OK. I am now incredibly engaged.<br /><br />Said nerd shows up at ultra-high-tech and secret facility, where in 14 days he uncovers what a phalanx of researchers missed during the previous 2 years. His discoveries lead to a revelation: an ancient stargate. A stargate!<br /><br />OK. Wow. By now I am having heart palpitations. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />Sadly, soon after the movie begins an inexorable slide into stupidity, and fully degenerates into a seen-it-a-million-times-before GO GO GO AMERICA battle. I feel sick. The scene where one of the alien kids proudly does a full military salute makes me almost puke. (As does the scene where the alien kid thinks it is cool to smoke! Did the tobacco lobby underwrite the film?)<br /><br />WHEN will we as a species be able to accept the idea that meeting an alien species MIGHT be a good thing? When, if ever, will we respond with fascination, curiosity, and awe rather than guns?
B002JIEYL2|4.0|Sorry I didn't give it 5 stars, but I'm very picky about giving the 5th star to albums. Anyway to the review.  As I said this is yet again another awesome Sabbath record, from start to finish! The only real skip-over track is \\"Fluff\\", eh, not big bother listening to it.   This is a heavy metal classic, and every metal needs this record!  I could rant about this album, but no, I'm gonna keep this nice a short.  If you like loud riffing metal then don't wait and this album!
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I stand amazed at how, unlike other science fiction from the time, the original 1977 movie \\"Star Wars\\" (unseen since VHS days) stands up to the passing years.  Without the digital do-funnies and CGI visual effects, the original stands on the weight of actors' performances, skillful direction, and well-managed physical design.  Apparently other reviewers disagree with me, but I think the 1977 film looks both remarkably current and surprisingly good.<br /><br />When the Special Edition appeared in 1997, I remember thinking Mos Eisley looked remarkably crowded and busy.  Looking back on it now, I see why: because in the original, the streets stand empty.  This is a city where heat, poverty, and neglect boil over in a cauldron of desperation, just waiting for one half-cocked stormtrooper to set things on fire.  The revised version looks as busy as a college campus.<br /><br />In the best Hitchcock style, Lucas' subtle direction cuts around several times so you never notice you didn't see blasters go off, or lightsabers extend.  Lacking high-tech gadgets, Lucas uses ingenuity and human insight to make this film, and it's visible in the finished product.  He really sells that Tunisia and Guatemala are alien planets, or that sets built in airplane hangars actually are as big as a \\"small moon.\\"<br /><br />That's not to forgive Lucasfilm for the shoddy transfer to DVD.  The 1977 version is very low-res, only slightly cleaner than my old VHS tape.  Nothing I've said should suggest that the original film surpasses the Special Edition.  The 1997 version has more smoothly integrated visual effects, more dynamic creatures, crisper colors, and cleaner sound.  But in a genre that notoriously doesn't age well, the original film looks remarkably new.
0375703764|5.0|I'll start out by saying that I loved the book. Not all of it, but the parts I did love I felt were great enough to push this to a 5-star review. Explaining it is kind of complicated.<br /><br />The story of the book is that a young man finds a manuscript of an analysis of a documentary in an elderly man's apartment after the man had passed away. It contains not only the analysis of \\"The Navidson Record\\", but the author's notes, and the notes of the young man who found it. Frankly, I found his notes (which often wandered into pages and pages of stories about how his life has gone crazy since finding it) to be the weakest part, so I focused on the analysis--the manuscript he found in the apartment. The documentary is the real focus of the story, and the manuscript is a very unique way of telling that story. I can't think of a better way to have gotten across the weird creepiness of what the documentary should be without doing it this way.<br /><br />Occasionally, yes, the formatting gets weird for the sake of being weird, but a couple places it really works: in one of the most quickly paced sequences, each page only has a couple sentences. As the scene gains momentum, there are fewer and fewer words on each page, and you find yourself whipping through the pages faster and faster, and it really adds to the tension. You're not just sitting there leisurely reading an intense scene, you're moving as frantically as the characters.<br /><br />The idea of the Navidson Record is fascinating, and a wonderful idea. However, you have to work for it a little, and like the best horror movies, most of the actual horror plays upon the fact that the unknown is far scarier than anything you could ever see. Fortunately, the part I found to be most hindering to enjoyment of the book (Johnny's notes) are easily skipped. I'd say that if your interest is piqued by the idea of a house that's larger on the inside than it is on the outside, then you should give it a shot.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL-E is a very funny disney movie and it is rather cheap to get on Amazon and I received it during the 5 day time frame that it was listed to arrive in. I enjoy the movie and am thankful to have received it from Amazon.com Thank you for sending my order within the time frame that it was listed to arrive in.
B003N5VOUO|2.0|Not going to waste time rereviewing the movie since others have done a much better job of it then I have.  What I will say is that Fox has given us a bum deal with a single disk version lacking all of the good bonus features found on the Indian version.  No directions comments, no bonus scenes; just a couple of duds.  If you are interested in getting this film you should track down a 2-disk Indian version.
0143118420|2.0|I was given this book by a friend, I normally would not have bought this type of book. I think much of the story is fictitious and why do the people she meets always have some fantastic background, i.e., the Brazilian lady who worked for the UN, Richard from Texas, (an unbelievable character if ever there was one)? Luca Spaghetti?  Oh, be real.   I just can't believe she met so many exceptional characters.  Her statement that \\"we all need God\\" just turned me off as I don't believe in God but I don't mind if anyone else does.  How presumptuous to believe that she knows what I need.  I became disinterested during the India section and my interest continued to wane until I couldn't finish the book.  This book is a waste of time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This books main job was to get the reader from book one to book three - it's pace is a little slow, and it doesn't get intense until the last third of the book. However, it is well written, and enjoyable. If you loved the Hunger Games, you should definitely read this book, just don't expect the pacing to be quite the same.
B002TG3C8A|5.0|I bought this in April of 2010 as a wedding present for my Wife.  Since we are both Thelemic and the wedding was at a Gnostic Mass (O.T.O.) it went over VERY well.  Everyone was so surprised when she opened it up.  All of the women gathered around and exclaimed \\"Who got you that!?\\" with surprise and apprehension in their voices.  When my Wife told them that it was her new husband that had bought it as a wedding present they where all quite \\"giddy\\".  My quick reply was - \\"Well Honey, since we cannot afford to go to Germany and see Rammstein at least you can enjoy the band at home\\".    An excellent product.  Well built and very impressive!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book deals with a very dismal subject - the idea that teens have to kill each other to survive. And even though the government is corrupted, and the competitors are brutal, there is reason to hope, and the book has an uplifting tone. It is also very intense - you'll probably want to read it in one sitting. I was up way too late reading this :)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|It was easy to install and use.  Works perfectly.  Excellent clarity and vibrant sound.    I was a bit on the wall about buying this at first, however, after playing Modern Warfare and watching a couple of Netflix movies I cannot see why anyone would hesitate in buying it.    Kudos to Turtle Beach!

0123694965|5.0|\\"The Art of Game Design\\" is one of the only game design textbooks that uses clear, plain English to teach the fundamentals of game design. It is packed with wisdom and inspiration.

B003U6BE8I|3.0|Although this movie tries to be serious about the Greek mythology and the demi-gods (who seem to be confined to a perpetual summer camp named Camp Half-Blood that specializes in sword-fight training), the gravitas is lost in cheesy performances by the adult actors who portray the mythical characters. The younger actors give more lively performances as the young demi-god, Percy Jackson, along with his inevitable love-interest and loyal side-kick satyr (who steals every scene) have an exciting road-trip from NYC to Hell (AKA Hollywood) and back, saving Percy's mother and exposing the evil-doer's plot. The \\"surprise\\" betrayal by another demi-god is ill-explained and consequently ill-portrayed by the actor, but in an awkward-looking aerial fight, as expected, the hero saves the day. In the end, this is a typical hero-in-the-making movie with quite a few weak points but still manages to be quite a fun watch, even though it might not be a strong enough installment to be memorable or launch a franchise.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This may be the best Dickens miniseries yet made by the BBC. After scoring a series of dud literary adaptations in the first decade of the millennium (A ROOM WITH A VIEW, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED), Andrew Davis returned to the metier that served him best in the 1990s with this 2008 multi-part adaptation of a long Victorian novel and reaffirmed the faith many of us had nearly lost in his abilities. Actors have long loved Dickens adaptations because they can take the indelible outlines of characters Dickens provides and make them deeper and richer; it would be hard to imagine a cast that could do better with these parts than we find here. Claire Foy retains the sweetness and loyalty of the title character while also showing us her intelligence and her awareness of the besetting selfishness of her family, while Matthew MacFadyen (still handsome, if less dashing than in his previous roles in THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) is ideal as her well-meaning if blinkered eventual beau Arthur Clennam. The real acting honors, though go to the characters in the more colorful parts: Eddie Marsan as the snorting snuffling Pancks, the crusty rent-collector with the gentle heart; Amanda Redman as the viciously snobbish Mrs. Merdle; Andy Serkis, fully realizing the caricature of an evil Frenchman Dickens draws in Rigaud/Blandois and making him truly loathsome and scary; Tom Courtenay, in the most Lear-like of Dickens' characters, William Dorrit, \\"the Father of the Marshalsea\\"; and above all the estimable Judy Parfitt, subtly showing the great conflicts within the grotesquely proud Mrs. Clennam with the tiniest twitches of her mouth and eyebrows. This seems a more expensive production than many Dickens miniseries, and allows for a very complex vision of London that is alternately sunny and welcome and also claustrophobic and frightening. The greatest set is a magnificent recreation of the Clennams' crumbling house near the Thames, which seems to tremble with the anguish of those within. Davies has some difficulty wrapping up the multiple plot threads in the final episodes (a few are left unexplained, such as the fate of the Gowans and Meagleses), but the production does full justice to Dickens's unforgettable denouement with Mrs. Clennam rising into the streets to beg forgiveness only to see the falling apart of her house with the most truly wicked within it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best written and most original show ever. If it would have been marketed well and broadcast in the correct order we would still get to enjoy this masterpiece
1400032717|5.0|Recent understanding has brought most people who think of someone with autism, on the autism spectrum, or with Asperberger's, away from the RainMan stereotype, thankfully.  This book is a wonderful window into the mind of a high functioning young adult living semi-independently.  As a parent of a child with a mental disability, it was a painful book to read, and I imagine it would be even harder for someone with a loved one with autism specifically.  However, the author treats the character with dignity, giving him a personality and a mission.  A neighbor's dog has died and he recognizes that when things go wrong in the neighborhood, he is often to blame. This recognition is painful for the him and the reader.  His mission is to investigate the suspicious canine death to clear his name.  In his socially inept way, he stumbles on more than he should and uncovers bigger secrets.  The reader recognizes things before he does, making us want to protect him from life's harsh realities.  However, as a functioning adult, he can't be protected from everything and he must experience all the pain life has to offer too.
145283668X|5.0|Many times publishers will publish several short stories in one book, creating a large volume of short stories. I find myself spending a fair amount of my reading time flipping through the cumbersome book trying to find my story.  But I love how this publisher is releasing short stories as their own book. The book is beautifully made: The design, layout, and text is very easy to read. And of course, what a great story. Robert Louis Stevenson explores humanity's darker side through the characters of Dr. Jekyll and the infamous Mr. Hyde. The book is feeling like an old friend already.
B001GQSY64|2.0|The Clone Wars \\"microseries\\" created for the Cartoon Network have a noble simplicity to them - they are short and crudely animated, but they are fun and full of energy and adventure.  Most importantly, they \\"feel\\" like Star Wars stories.  I've only seen a few of the shows from the regular series, but they too are fast-paced, action-packed, and generally a lot of fun to watch.  Unfortunately, this movie, which bridges the microseries with the regular series, is a placeholder, uninteresting, and even cringe-worthy in parts.    Intellectually, I can't tell what the problem is with the movie.  Perhaps it's because it IS a movie - the writers/directors/producers of the show are used to 22-minute slots.  Instead of coming up with a deeper story to fill out the longer length, they simply add in more effects sequences.  How many times do we really want to watch Clone troopers (who all look the same) battling droids (that all look the same) in ruined cities (that all look the same)?  The screenplay isn't much better - there is a minimum of information exchange, and some very cringe-inducing \\"banter\\" between Anakin and his padawan.  At least the battledroids have some nifty one-liners, as does General Greivous.  When Clone Wars works, it's showing us stuff we've never seen before (e.g. commando teams of Clones infiltrating behind enemy lines).    Do yourself a favour - skip this and buy any of the TV series.  I think even small children will find the series (and the actual live action films, for that matter) more enjoyable than this film.    The extras don't give much extra for the Star Wars fan either.  There are recording sessions, and it's always interesting to see what the voice actors look like.  There are also some deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  But ultimately the film rests on the fact that we're seeing Clones vs. Droids again and again, and I just can't accept that of all the evil plots Darth Sidius could come up with to try and gain control of the universe, his best was kidnapping Jabba the Hutt's son.
B001DHXT20|5.0|this movie was in  excellent condition no scrathes  a very good picture quality and sound.
B000002BNB|5.0|Ghostface has always been one of my favourite clansman and this album does not disapoint. It's perhaps RZA's finest work, (whom should get equal credit for Ironman's success). I can't say it surpasses Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., although it does not fall far from it. I can't recomend this title to anyone who is into today's commercial rap, i.e. Lil Wayne, Drake etc... Nothing against those certain individuals, but this is a different type of hip-hop music. Old school heads will love this, although, I can't imagine what people were thinking when this album came out. No other albums that came out in '96 sound like this. RZA is a true pioneer and has set the trend for many producers to follow his craft, i.e. Kanye West and Just Blaze. But I digress, Ghostface is the man, with several guest spots from fellow clansmen, especially Cappadonna's verse in Winter Warz. Other guests include, The Delphonics and Mary J. Blige.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|Mildly entertaining. That's about it.. mostly boring really. Love Jane Austin, but not this movie.
1582701709|5.0|I never actually read the whole book.    I did however watch the movie... for free. I never went to any extra seminars, and I never bought any extra books.    Maybe there's marketing packaged inside.  Maybe it's rubbish.  Maybe she wanted to make money.    OR maybe she actually wanted to help people.  You know like fire fighters, teachers, 9/11 rescue workers.  Stop believing EVERYONE is 100 percent selfish.    Anyways, all of it made sense to me and I wholeheartedly applied it to my life.  It was difficult at first, however it becomes fun to use it.    I actually received everything that I visualized myself to have.  Being more fit, getting a new truck, getting better grades, getting a certain type of woman.    Perhaps the scientific aspects of the book may be wrong.  Maybe that's me being disciplined and just working hard.    However the main point we can learn from this work is that is the secret to success: scientifically speaking or not... staying positive and focusing on what you want.    The concepts in this book allow you to dream once again.  And if you don't believe in dreams, then you have lost your lust for life.    Which poker champion, which CEO, which ladies man didn't at least believe and visualize that they could and ought to have have those things first?  Sure some things in life may happen by chance, but to achieve greatness you do have to believe in yourself.  And with this book you can learn how to believe once again.    As children dreams were all we had, as adults its all we need.

0439023483|5.0|As you probably know by now, Hunger Games is about a post-apocaliptic North America. The land is now Panem, a country divided into the capital and 12 distinct districts. Each year, to show that the leaders in the capital are all-powerful, two children (a boy and a girl aged 12-18) are chosen from each district to compete in a televised battle royale. The 24 children must fight to the death, until only one stands. That winner will bring wealth and respect back to his or her family and district. The entire event is broadcast to the city for - disgustingly - its entertainment.    Sixteen year old Katniss Evergreen is from District 12, a very poor area known for coal mining. With her father dead, she single-handedly takes care of her mother and younger sister, Prim. When Prim is chosen to be part of the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. So, she and the baker's son, Peeta, are taken to the capital and - eventually - the games, where they have to use every skill possible to literally stay alive.    The book is extremely gripping from page one. Part The Lottery, part Lord of the Flies and part Battle Royale, it brings all of the themes together into one delicious read. And it doesn't hold back. While just a young adult book, Suzanne Collins does not treat her readers like children. From the moment the games begin, character die - brutally. Shocking, terrifying, and utterly engaging, the book doesn't let you put it down.    I enjoyed the overall theme - how the government, when given the chance, can really overtake and overthrow society. I never forgot how much was at stake for Katniss, as she navigated the playing field, and it utterly terrified me. It's a great read for today's society, that's so obsessed with reality tv shows.    There's a reason the book has been linked to the Twilight series. While much better written, it's equally as grabbing. There isn't a vampire, yet there is an underlying romance brewing for Katniss. Yet, as opposed to Bella, Katniss is extremely hardcore. She's not weak, and while at times she does doubt her survival, she continues going. She's a fantastic character.    While brutal, the book was truly fantastic and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the sequel (and the release of the final book of the trilogy - Mockingjay). Seriously, don't doubt it. It may seem similar in theme, but it definitely brings a new spin and is incredibly haunting from page one. It shows the power of children, and, ultimately, the raw talent of the author. It keeps you thinking, as any great book should do.
0470601787|5.0|As a visual practitioner, I've come to rely on The Grove Consultants International for serious facilitation tools. With \\"Visual Meetings,\\" David Sibbet hits the mark again, putting all the basics in a compact container. I can reach in and grab what I need for nearly any engagement, refresh my learning and find something I didn't know in every chapter. Beyond the mechanics of visual thinking and its relationship to productivity, David covers the gamut of imminently practical methods, approaches and techniques that are hallmarks of The Grove. He is meticulous about covering the \\"why\\" with the \\"what,\\" the \\"how\\" along side the \\"when.\\" It's the Chicago Style Manual for visual practitioners and the Holy Grail for anybody who wants to see results from their organization's meetings.    Make no mistake, this is not a compendium. It's all meat and no bone, yet at a svelte 250 pages Mr. Sibbet manages to capture essence and theory without neglecting nuance and detail. He's a master at the craft of communicating how to achieve group creativity and productivity.
1439102813|2.0|I know that lots of people loved this book, but I did not.  There is solid information here about Alzheimers, and it does help you understand how frightening this experience is for anyone - particularly those suffering with early Alheimer's.  My issue with the book is just that the characters simply were not believable.  They were shallow props used to carry medical information about this devastating disease.  The characters - and their interactions with one another - are shallow and predictable. Perhaps part of my issue with the book stems from the fact that I do know someone with this illness . . . and hence already knew some of the manifestations that are depicted in the book.  Ultimately though, I am looking for something transformative in a novel, and with this book, I just found it was basically a medical treatise about the disease.

0525423842|3.0|This book has all the page-turning hallmarks that all Grisham books have.  And he's done a nice job crafting it for the juvenile audiences.  I only hope there is a sequel to it, because otherwise, the ending is anticlimactic and, really, is disappointing.  I always screen my kids books.  I have no problem letting my 11 year old read it.  But i have no doubt he will walk away commenting that his Harry Potter and Narnia collections are more exciting.  A decent freshman walk-on, but i'm looking forward more to a sophomore sequel to finish the story-line.  Good character development is the books strength.
0316010669|2.0|This book really grabbed my attention in the first few pages with its description of an art forgery, but things really slowed down about a third of the way into the book. The only other part that was really interesting to me was Gladwell's description of John Gottman's research with couples. That's about it. Most of the other examples were down right boring. I found myself looking at how many pages I had left. Worst of all, after finishing the book, I had no idea what the point of it was. Gladwell spends the first half of the book explaining why we should trust our gut instinct, but spends the last half demonstrating how our gut instinct can be wrong. I had to read almost 300 pages for that?
B0036EH3XE|5.0|this is to all the people who wanted to know the answers and claim that they wern't satisfied with the one's they got. if you were one of these people that longed for resoulution with each mystery the show had woven in the last 6 years then YOU MISSED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE GREATEST TV SERIES OF ALL TIME! lost season 6 from start to finish was mezmorizing, beautiful, and touching. i cried at the end of every episode this season and pretty much lost it the night it ended. the creators new what they were doing all along and ended it in the most puriest,catartic manor. this show made you think and brought about a another level of living i sure didn't think was possible. LOVE was the message here... without that life is not worth living. so to all the heaters THAT HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THE SERIES FROM DAY 1 (SEP 22, 2004) you missed out and im sorry for you and there's one lesson you can take from this, sometimes you just need to let go.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|If nothing else the disparate viewer reactions to \\"The Orphan\\" make for interesting reading on these comment pages. My advice for potential viewers is to disregard the most extreme love-hate stuff; the film is neither as good nor as bad as a lot of people are saying.        It is basically a slightly more bent and graphic version of Julia Stiles' 1998 film \\"Wicked\\". Both films revolve around ruthless jockeying for household supremacy, both have an erotic subtext that people seem to be afraid to discuss, and both push the envelope of the \\"Bad Seed\\" (1956) genre-reflecting the more extreme attitudes of current fans of the psychological horror genre.        \\"Orphan\\" had a much bigger budget than the earlier films which it quite skillfully utilized in useful areas like production design and cinematography. It is very creative in these areas and Esther (the latest \\"demon seed\\"- nicely overplayed by Isabelle Fuhrman) gets a nice dimensionality from the regular showcasing of her art. The painting of the burning orphanage is especially well done and extremely effective; being as creepy as any visual image I have ever seen.        I would certainly recommend the film to fans of \\"Wicked\\" (and vice versa) and to even causal fans of the horror genre. I think it is too extreme for crossover fans, who would be wise to avoid the film or at least to be prepared to bail at some point because it gets increasingly twisted as it progresses. Unless you are willing to suspend disbelief during a number of plot developments you won't enjoy the viewing. It is a bit like \\"May\\" (2002) in this regard, where a lot of viewers enjoy the premise and the set-up but lose interest when the characters get too extreme or too stupid for audience identification.        It is a long film (slightly over two hours), which would not be a problem if they had focused more on solving the mystery of Esther's background. Because the film offers viewers minimal cerebral exercises like this, their attention wondersto plot holes and the film begins to get a bit tedious.        Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|If I'm not mistaken, the producers of LOST had a 6 year contract, which would officially end in 2010. However, the writer's strike in 2008 caused a lot of complications for just about every TV show. It shortened season 5 and I'm guessing that must have had an impact on season 6 as well. They had less time to wrap up ALL THE ANSWERS. In my opinion, they did the best they could with what time they had left. I've been a LOST fan from the very beginning and would never sell out this truly amazing tv show.
B001EN71CW|3.0|Seriously, i ordered this based solely on the fact that it had so many 5 star ratings. I sit in a dialysis unit for 2.5 hours a day five days a week dieing or boredum begging to have the energy to get up and walk out. i spend my time there watching movies and TV shows i missed. I should have skipped over this one<br /><br />This is a show about how the human race reached out across the galaxy to teriform and populate planets. one of the shows i watched today was about MUD FARMERS in a hick little farm all dressed like they were from the early 1800's erth. I don't get it.<br /><br />In Star Trek you meet alien life, you see different worlds as different the Earth. for the most part it seems like only white earthlings got anywhere in the galaxy in Firefly.<br /><br />If westerns are your thing, if you like riding horses, bar fights and guns (yes fire arms, not phasers), then this is the show for you. they could have made this better having a gang of 9 riding in the wild west saving people and doing illicity deeds for the shady....but no, they went and put in a space ship instead
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This movie is great. Yes, there's some violence but there are many more violent movies out there that the critics love. I think it is the cerebral nature of the violence that critics are taking umbrage with; they are not used to the idea of the so called common man rising above his circumstances to take control of his life. Butler is amazing in this film but since the cognoscenti don't like the role he is playing he will never be acknowledged for it.    The only gripe I have is the ending: it was manufactured to make the lawyer character  way more clever and incisive than he actually is during the course of the movie.     Otherwise...great...bordering on brilliant...I prefer this movie over Silence of the Lambs...
B00003CXDB|5.0|I have a hard time finding this DVD.  Is in great shape.  Glad I could finally get it
B002MJV75O|5.0|This is a great deal. I had know problems with the packaging. My DVDs were protected by a plastic cover. It is worth the price. This was one of my favorite shows growing up. The impersonaters will never top it. I would recommend this product to any Creek fan.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law. She loves musicals! It is a classic must see for anybody though!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Long awaited!  Thanks Fox.  The near-$100 price point seems a tad high for four movies but if they truly threw all these extras into two discs then I guess it'll be worthwhile.    Thanks Fox~!  (Thanks TheTruthHurts for helping generate such great reviews.)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I've only been watching Supernatural for five months. I brought season one in April 2010 and fell in love with the series and Sam and Dean Winchester. \\"Savin' People, hunting things, the family business.\\" I believe Supernatural has done a great job with supernatural enities, family, faith, hope, loss, love, sibling rivalry, religion? (mythology?) I won't go on with that point, sacrifice,survival,addiction, and the road to redemption. I went from season one to season four. Season four proved my favorite. Seasons two and three came next. Season three and four were hilarious! I've never laughed so hard at a tv show. Never liked two tv siblings as much before Sam and Dean Winchester. My only complaint with this series is why they feel the need to kill the female characters. I loved them. Honestly, Season five had its problems. The \\"Changing Channels\\" episode was LOL FUN. Certain parts were just stupid in my opinon and the Sam herpeas ad was hard to watch. Maybe I'd rate \\"Fallen Idols\\" as the worst. I hate Paris Hilton. I get that its paying to Jared's time in \\"House of Wax\\" and the episode \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" to Jensen's time in the 2009 version of the same title. Okay, to my most favorite moments. THE ULTIMATE SAM WINCHESTER episode \\"Point of No Return\\" was the fan girl dream eppy. Sam grew up big time. Also in \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" we get more \\"wee-chesters\\" moments and Sam comptiplates why he's in heaven. In \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" Sam finally gets to time travel and he saw his parents essentially for the first time. For someone who grew up without a mother and alienated from his father, this glimpse affected him in a way that Dean will never understand. He got his chance for peace with John even though it was with a John before he was even born. He was even willing to split John and Mary up, thus saving them from conciving him or Dean and ending the family curse. God, gotta love this show. \\"Swan Song\\" to me personally did move very slow and I felt I was watching soap opera. But this episode was grand. Oh but the power of love (brotherly love). Sam couldn't fight Lucifer. He couldn't stop Lucifer from killing Castiel and Bobby, hurting Dean badly. Sam took control because of the memories shared by Sam and Dean through the years triggered by the toy army soldier in the ash tray of the Impala was all it took. How poetic! I however, do miss the brotherly bond from seasons one-three. Seasons four and five did have too much sibling rivalry. I'm tired of the fighting. They had to go through it though and they have, god, they have. Here's hoping a more better, understanding relationship between the boys and more, more laughs and pranks. Oh the good old days.

My own story isn't much different, my mom would read this book to my brother and I before we went to sleep. The book was ripped and torn from years of use. I don't even need the book anymore because I have it memorized. Anyway, great book, great story, worth every penny :)

I bought Volume 1 also, and am grateful to FOX for doing the right thing and releasing Volume 2 so I do not have to buy the entire season.  Great show!
030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" by Stieg Larsson is the third book in the men-who-love-to-hate-women trilogy featuring fearless investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the socially inept, tech savvy Lisbeth Salander.  In the two previous books Blomkvist and Salander joined together to take on corporate sleazballs, corrupt government officials and a whole prostitution ring. Larsson's world is humorless, dark and brooding where everybody drinks coffee and eats mostly open faced sandwiches, the good guys always win while the bad guys are almost cartoonish.<br /><br />The first book \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]\\" concentrated around introducing the cast of characters to the reader.  In the book Blomkvist had his professional reputation destroyed and is forced (financially) to accept an assignment from an elderly, rich industrialist, Henrik Vanger, to solve the mystery of his missing great-niece.  Vanger's people researched Blomkvist background by hiring a security firm which unleashes their best researcher on him, Salander.  After Blomkvist learns of this he teams up with Salander and the rest is history.<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]\\" - STOP HERE!!!!<br /><br />The second book, \\"[[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]]\\" is a middle book in all sense of the word.  There is no beginning and no end, although it is not altogether bad (think \\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\").  The book picks up with Blomkvist and Salander move to the north of Sweden to the Vanger family's island.  The Vangers are so rich that they live in their own universe filled with dysfunctional, backstabbing and mistrust of close relatives.  Even though book #2 is entertaining, it is cartoonish, over the top and a bit silly.  Investigating a sex trafficking ring Blomkvist stumbles upon an ex-Soviet spy named Alexander Zalachenko.  Lo and behold Zalachenko is Salander's father who still holds a grudge because she tried to burn him when she was 12 (\\"...played with fire\\").  Salander holds a grudge because Zalachenko beat her mother senseless and caused her brain damage.<br />And you thought the Vangers were screwed up?<br /><br />Zalachenko frames Salander for a bunch of murders committed by his German henchman (who feels no pain due to a neurological disorder), then tries to kill her and buries her alive only for our beloved anti-social hacker to come back and exact her revenge using an ax to the head.<br />Like father like daughter.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" brings the series down to a more dignified world where, I'm sure, Starbucks are the kings of the universe and Subway are following close behind.  Somehow Zalachenko survived the ax-to-the-head incident and now the Swedish Security Police are all up in arms because it might be discovered that they ignored the constitution in order to give him protection and did such horrible things as lock up a 12 year old girl in a mental institution so she won't be able to finger the defector.  Only that it's not the whole Security Police, but just a fringe group of old spies.  However they have no idea who they are dealing with and are the main adversaries to Blomkvist and Salander.<br /><br />The third book of the series if finely crafted much like the first.  Larsson does a skillful job at interlacing between the good and the bad, the intelligence agencies, the police and the media.  While the first book was about corporate takedowns, the second about the sex traffickers this one is more of a courtroom drama.  .There are still many elements which the first two books incorporate: Salander and Blomkovist punish their enemies, strong female characters, relaxed attitude toward sex and, as mentioned, strong opinions about government, corporations and sleazeballs in general..<br /><br />Throughout the book it seemed that Larsson spread his own personal anti-corporate agenda a bit too thick tothe point where it was almost disturbing.  There are subplots which do not enhance the story, unless you take into account the author's personal ideals (which I try not to) and rants about men who enable violence against women.  That's all fine and well but it would be better left for a book club questions type guide which accompanies many books. Unlike the previous books, I found the ending of \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" a bit rushed and almost confused.  It felt as if Larsson's editors had to cut the book down to a manageable size (relatively speaking) and that's with only briefly introducing the characters, since they were introduced in the first book.<br /><br />However, the blatant activism is forgivable and to end on a good note, I'm happy to report that none of the characters have died of coffee overdose, as I was sure was going to happen.<br /><br />A kind word to Reg Keeland who must have drank tons of coffee during the fine translation of this book.<br /><br />For more reviews please visit ManOfLaBook dot comich do not enhance the story, unless you take into account the author's personal ideals (which I try not to) and rants about men who enable violence against women.

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Triangle (2009) is a twisted tale of suspense, that is one long strange repetitive ride.  Time and reality become non-linear, as just when it seems that the matter has ended, it begins again at a different juncture.  It's hard to explain, but as the cycle of events repeats, different parts of the story are filled in, eventually leading to a better understanding of some matters, while the overall picture still remains clouded in mystery.  Writer/director Christopher Smith has produced a film with many layers, where some things only become apparent through repeated viewings.<br /><br />A movie where almost nothing is what is seems it be, Triangle has some violence and scares, but is not a horror film.  Jess (Melissa George) is a single mother looking to get away for a weekend cruise aboard her friend Greg's (Michael Dorman) sailboat.  A party of six, leaves Key West aboard the `Triangle', and heads out to sea, where they run into an unexpected storm that capsizes the small craft.  The survivors are floating on the upturned hull, when they happen across a small liner, and manage to board the nearly deserted ship called the Aeolus.<br /><br />Once aboard, the action focuses in on Jess, and very strange things begin to happen, as violence erupts, and people begin to die (or do they?).  Saying more might ruin things for those who have not seen the film, but suffice to say, the story involves cyclical actions, and as the film progresses, it becomes evident that the scope of the cycles involved, is larger than one might initially think.  While some questions are apparently answered, other questions are raised, and much continues to be confusing and ambiguous.<br /><br />There are good performances by everyone involved, particularly Rachael Carpani, but this film is clearly a showcase for Melissa George, who is onscreen most of the time, once the survivors board the Aeolus.  Jess is faced with a cruelly twisted reality, that is almost impossible to comprehend.  On a strange, highly tense journey, she finds herself doing things she would never have thought possible.  Not everything makes sense, and there are questions left unanswered.  While not a masterpiece, Triangle connects enough dots to constitute a compelling, provocative, and very watchable thriller.<br /><br />For such a deep and complex effort, a commentary by Christopher Smith would certainly have been most enlightening, but disappointingly there are no major extras in this edition, just some brief interviews.e journey, she finds herself doing things she would never have thought possible.

030745455X|1.0|Liked the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (execept for having to go back many, many times to earlier pages to keep the Vanger family members straight).<br /><br />I looked forward to reading The Girl Who Played with Fire. I started it and thought it was awful. Either bad writing or bad translating, but for me, unreadable.<br /><br />I will not bother with the Hornet's Nest. Have to agree with a reviewer of that book that the cover title typo alone keeps me from picking it up. [[ASIN:B001NLKT60 The Girl Who Played with Fire]]
B001OQCV2E|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  In order to enjoy a disaster movie, it's important to suspend your disbelief to a large extent. Don't expect this type of movie to be at all logical, nor should you expect its characters to be very well developed. If the plot takes you from 'A' to 'B', with a reasonable amount of fast-paced action, then it probably has done its job.<br /><br />  No, I did not think 2012 was a masterpiece; but with its great special effects, it certainly ranks as passable. 2012 deals with a rather unpleasant subject: the end of the world. The ancient Mayan prediction that the world will come to an end in 2012, comes true in this movie. Director Roland Emmerich purposely avoids hammering his audience with true tragedy. We never see any close-ups of mangled bodies or blood being shed. Everything is shot at a distance so that we get the 'bigger picture' of what it would be like when the world is destroyed; that way, the true horror and terror is minimized.<br /><br />  The best scenes in 2012 focus on the journey of part-time novelist and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis, very ably played by John Cusack. His journey begins when he picks up his kids from his ex-wife, who is now living with a new boyfriend, Gordon, a plastic surgeon, and takes them on a vacation excursion to Yellowstone National Park. Curtis runs into the best character in the film, Charlies Frost, in one of Woody Harrelson's best roles in a long time. What's so wonderful about the crazed Frost, is that he's one of these guys who's been trying to warn the world about his apocalyptic world view for years and now everything he's been saying has been vindicated. Frost actually welcomes death and stands impassively as the volcano consumes him. He revels in his last 'moment in the sun'. Curtis, on the other hand, initially believes him to be a crackpot, especially after Frost claims he has a map with the location of a secret ark project, which the world leaders have been working on, anticipating the end of the world.<br /><br />  Finally Curtis sees the light when he sees the news report about the seismic activity that splits a supermarket in half which his ex-wife and her boyfriend were just in. He wisely rents a small plane and then drives to LA where he picks up his ex-wife, the boyfriend and his two children and then drives to the airport as the city collapses around them. Yes, all the near misses are ridiculous, but the special effects will keep you riveted to your seat. After making it to the airport, there's a new surprise: the pilot is dead and Gordon must fly the plane, despite only having a few lessons as a student pilot. They fly to Yellowstone in order to get a hold of Charlie's map and just escape as a volcano explodes. The map points to China and Curtis realizes that they'll never get there in a Cessna.<br /><br />  When they arrive in Las Vegas, a huge crack has already appeared in the airport runway. Curtis runs into his Russian billionaire boss, Yuri, who has paid for tickets on the Ark, and also happens to have a giant Antonov 500 aircraft, which takes them to China. Yuri is another colorful character, who ruthlessly ditches his girlfriend, Tamara, as he only has three tickets for himself and his two children on the Ark. But later, he redeems himself by saving his children by throwing them onto the Ark while the gates are closed and then falling to his death as a result.<br /><br />  There's more exciting action when the Ark is unable to power up due to a jammed and malfunctioning boarding gate. At the last minute, as the effects of a tsunami pushes the Ark toward Mt. Everest (which has been displaced to a different location thousands of miles away due to a movement of the earth's crust), Curtis goes underwater inside the hydraulics chamber (and with the assistance of his son) removes an impact driver which has been preventing the Ark from powering up.<br /><br />  As to be expected, despite all the great action scenes, 2012 falls down in the area of character development. Emmerich serves up a cornucopia of politically correct characters including three blacks who are virtually faultless. They are: Dr. Adrian Helmsely, the American geologist, who proves how righteous he is when he insists that the stranded passengers who couldn't board a damaged Ark be allowed on the one he's boarded (Helmsley notes that his assigned room can fit a lot more people). Pitted against him is the supposedly heartless, white Chief of Staff, Carl Annheuser (Oliver Platt), who argues realistically that allowing the extra passengers might jeopardize the entire project. Even worse is the saintly president, Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), who decides to remain in Washington, and 'go down with the ship'. In contrast, Emmerich obnoxiously has Queen Elizabeth board the Ark with a couple of her Corgis, implying that she's a coward! Naturally the president's daughter, Laura Wilson, must overcome her grief by striking up a romance with Helmsley, as they head for their new destination in Africa.<br /><br />  There's plenty of other cheesy stuff that relegates 2012 to the realm of the mediocre. There's a particularly distasteful line about how the gene pool will be compromised when two Arab sheiks are seen, en route to board one of the Arks. And what about how expendable Gordon, the ex-wife's boyfriend is. After he's killed, it takes a scant minute or so before the ex-wife is back in the arms of John Cusack (Curtis). Also note that that Tibetan Buddhist monks are noble but Chinese soldiers are heartless. Other disappointing characters and moments are well chronicled here on the internet. But 2012 sometimes gets it right: the last moment of the Indian astrophysicist and his family may go down as one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.er development.

0141034599|1.0|A compilation of pretentious citations from various literature and historical anecdotes, this book is an intellectually hollow basket delivered with a bombardment of flamboyant arrogance. It is a lengthy elaboration of an obvious problem that is inevitably recognized, consciously or subconsciously, by anyone with some basic analytic education: Total prescience is simply unattainable and thus any model attempting it is inherently defective (recall Gödel). In other words, there is no absolutely correct model--including those of hard sciences from Newtonian physics to relativity and quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make the whole idea worthless. A popular analogy among the revolutionary physicists at the turn of the last century makes the perfect point: Models are like Austrian train schedule; you can't trust it to predict exactly when the train will arrive, but without it, how would you tell if the train is late? The moral is, the fact that all models are defective is no reason to abolish modeling altogether; rather, it is a perpetually progressive process. The author seems deliberately ignore--since he is unlikely oblivious of--the reason why math models, or for that matter, human knowledge exists.    Thanks to Dr. Taleb -- unmistakably a smart and well-read man but of questionable ego and judgment, for glorifying a trivial observation (unpredicability of rare events) and canonizing it as the \\"Black Swan\\" problem. The trouble is, after being fed with all the model trashing, it is only fair for the reader to expect an alternative, if not better, approach from the author. That, after I reached the closing period of the book, is still as far from sight as at the time i turned the first page.
0553030000|5.0|This is the perfect place to start if you intend to read murder mystery books with any regularity.  The story has been done in plays and movies and on TV for decades but it is only in reading it that you catch the early clues and nuances of the characters.  Your knowledge is broadened to the allure of foreign languages and refined mannerisms of different nationalities.<br /><br />\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is an easy read.  The foreign expressions are brief and easily researched if one wishes to translate them.  The descriptions of clothing, appearance, and behavior are easily visualized and not a hindrance to the flow and enjoyment of the narrative.  Certainly I would recommend this book to eighth grade readers and up.  Murder is a serious crime and in reading this story young readers become acquainted with the deductive and methodical system of reasoning.  Education is advanced when \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is required reading in class.
030726839X|5.0|Hastings has the wonderful ability to synthesize an enormous body of material, weave it into an interesting narrative, and to make sound judgments about the historical questions presented.  In this book, he tells the familiar story of Churchill in World War Ii, but does so in a fresh way, adding negative as well as positive criticism of Churchill's performance.     Hastings contrasts Churchill's will with that of French premiere Reynaud and some of the defeatists in England.  Churchill's combative instincts and his ability to communicate to mobilize all of England explains much of the difference between the outcomes of the Battle of France and the Battle of England.  Of course, one should not ignore the geographic vulnerability of France versus the benefits of the English Channel and one should not ignore the effectiveness of the RAF.      Hastings is critical of the performance of the English Army, which surprises me.  However, he does make the case that unlike World War I, the English troops simply never were a match for the Germans unless they had overwhelming advantages in men, air cover, and artillery.  He is also critical of the English commanders.  Hastings is also effective at coveying the great crisis of confidence in England and Churchill's ability in overcoming it, but the ultimate inability of even Churchill to reverse the inevitable downfall of the English Empire by the end of the war.      Churchill's penchant for distracting adventures and reluctance to focus on the need to win the war in the west via a cross channel invasion are criticized.  Although Hastings believes Churchill was right to dissuade the U.S. from mounting suicidal cross channel invasions too early, he does concede that Churchill was too hesitant to launch D-Day.      In the end Hastings makes the case for the great man theory of history -- without Churchill's strong leadership, exceptional energy, and great communication skills, the war in the west may have turned out much differently.
B000002KDS|5.0|This is the first Alice Cooper album.<br /><br />Hold on. I know all about[[ASIN:B000056NV6 Pretties for You]] and [[ASIN:B0016OMGHY Easy Action]]. These were the first two albums using the name Alice Cooper, containing folk, hard rock, free jamming--all the eclecticism many great late 1960s bands threaded through their albums.<br /><br />Killers sheds this, and is where Alice Cooper, the nightmare we know, arrives. This threads straight down your throat with the creepo drive of hard rock we expect from Alice Cooper. Like Black Sabbath and the Stooges, Cooper cut the experimental head off the rock snake. Rock could be about pure volume, attitude, shock value. Blast didn't even have to have the political underpinnings of the MC5. It could be about dead babies, killers, a defiant yeah yeah yeah<br /><br />When the 1960s became the 1970s, hard rock for hard rock's sake took on a shape, a feel; music for the gearheads, the kids working in the gas stations, the supermarkets, no money and limited prospects. These kids were in the counterculture by circumstance, not choice. Cooper, like Sabbath, was music made for theme<br /><br />And in 2010, this sludge strain has no better example than Killers.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. IT takes me back to many of the old Kung-fu movies I wish Hollywood still made.  The story follows Po (Jack Black). A young goofy Panda who works in a soup kitchen by his father side. His father eagerly awaits the day he will take over the soup kitchen, but Po has other dreams. Po wishes to one day become the strongest Kung-fu warrior there ever was and fight along the noctorious Furious Five.    I won't say more because I don't want to give away too much, but this is definately one of the best animated movies I've seen since the Incredibles. The cinemagraphy for the action scenes in this movie are intense and had me on the edge of my seat. There was one scene in particular I found myself just sitting and looking at in awe from just how brilliant it was. There was also a training segment that was just breathtaking in its visual style. Its very reminiscent of old Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan movies. The movie itself looks extremely good. The lighting and detail made it fun to look at.I also found it clever that the all the furious Five are basically chosen and named after martial art styles. Don't even get me started on the main villian. He was definatly one of the best things about the movie. He was brutal, somewhat missunderstood because he was raised in a way that lead to his fall, almost unstoppable, and just powerful.  The story is actually kind of dark later on, but holds a message to it that I would expect in a martial arts movie like this.       Even though I'm giving this 5 stars there is one thing in particular I didn't like. The Furious Five are voiced by Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, and other very familiar actors, but they are barely given any dialogue in the movie. Not only that they didn't really go too deeply into the characters of the Furious Five. I know theres a second bonus dvd that they were selling in Walmart with the movie (I actually own both) that tells thier backstory, but I would have still loved if thiercharacters were given more time on screen. If they make a sequal, and I really hope they do, I wish they would flesh out thier characters a little more.      Kung-fu panda I admit won't be for everyone, expecially those who aren't into kungfu action films or overprotective parents who think anything that isn't barney level is too violent for kids. Kung-Fu Panda is a great homage to the action movies I love. Its original, fun, and just plain awesome. Its worth a buy for both children and adults to enjoy.
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Decca has taken the opportunity of Radu Lupu's sixty-fifth birthday to repackage his complete solo recordings for that label in a convenient and economical bargain box.  Veteran pianophiles will have long since experienced and acknowledged this great artist's remarkable gifts, and may well own one or more of the recordings anthologized herein.  However, for collectors unfamiliar with Lupu's achievements and his regrettably few outings in the recording studio, this superb retrospective is tailor-made.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that Lupu is both a formidable virtuoso and a consummate musician.  His technique is second to none, the refulgent sonorities he coaxes from his instrument quasi-orchestral in their kaleidoscopic array, his grasp of structure and style comprehensive, and his sensitivity to lyrical nuances instinctive.<br /><br />These qualities are particularly well suited to the solo repertoire he has chosen to record:  Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, Mozart (not for Decca, however)--and pre-eminently Schubert.  I doubt if there is, or ever has been, a greater interpreter of this composer than Lupu.  Not even Richter manages to sound Schubert's depths as thoroughly and effortlessly at Lupu.  This anthology is therefore worth purchasing for its generous helping of Schubert Sonatas and shorter works.  Among the highlights of this selection are exhaustively, even exhaustingly, cogent traversals of the Impromptus (no hint of the salon or of over-familiarity here); a devastating account of the haunting A-Minor sonata D. 845--all the more shattering for its surface understatement; a richly-textured version of the well-known A-Major Sonata, D. 664 that rivals, and in my estimation surpasses, Richter's famous recording for lyrical splendor and depth of insight; and a performance of Schubert's final Sonata, D. 960 that can only be called sublime--an unforgettable interpretation that gets everything right.  But then, Lupu tends to get nearly everything right whenever he performs Schubert: tempo, dynamic contrasts, mood, touch, texture and of course the all-important harmonic and tonal displacements. He understands with astonishing acuity the depth of Schubert's existential angst, even even at the most seemingly carefree moments--though he never wears Schubertian trauma on his sleeve (as some other renowned Schubertians, such as Richter, Arrau and Uchida, occasionally do).<br /><br />If I have spent a disproportionately large portion of this review on Lupu's Schubert, that is because this pianist is one of the the few who fully appreciates, and consistently realizes, the extent of the composer's achievement in piano literature.  And it may well be that Lupu understands Schubert more acutely than any interpreter since Schnabel first alerted us to the full stature of these inexhaustible works.<br /><br />I must not, however, slight Lupu's achievement in Brahms and Schumann.  He brings his poetic sensibilities and keen intellect to bear on both, with predictably satisfying results.  Lupu's gifts are abundantly evident in late Brahms; these elusive works in lesser hands can seem both enigmatic and insubstantial, but Lupu makes the listener aware of their sensuous beauty without slighting their inwardness. He seems less attuned to the ruggedness of the early Sonata, op. 5; I prefer the more objective and tougher approaches of Curzon and Katchen--he nevertheless does justice to this sprawling work's majesty as well as its lyricism. Likewise in Schumann's evergreen miniatures from op. 15 Lupu enables us to \\"see eternity in a grain of sand,\\" while in the more ambitious Humoreske, op. 20 and Kreisleriana, he effectively integrates what might seem like a patchwork of short sections into an organic whole. Moreover, Lupu's sumptuous tone and hypersensitive touch are perfectly suited to Schumann's sound-world as to Schubert's.<br /><br />I leave Beethoven for last only because I find Lupu's forays into this composer (comparatively) less satisfying than his astonishingly perceptive Schubert, Brahms and Schumann.  Lupu's take on Beethoven is predictably but excessively rhapsodic.  The Third Concerto (the pianist's first recording for Decca, and the only concertante work included in this anthology) is a case in point:  in this work phrasing, rubato and dynamics are waywardly, if at times intriguingly, personal.  The same goes, to a greater or lesser extent, for the three famous \\"named\\" sonatas:  Lupu's approach, though rapturously beautiful to the senses and highly nuanced, lacks the incisiveness, even abruptness, we expect in Beethoven.  One is reminded of both the vitues and vices of Arrau's Beethoven (Lupu's interpretation of the \\"Waldstein,\\" for instance, strongly recalls Arrau's, though with more plausible tempi).  But I mustn't dwell on these shortcomings, for there is also much to enjoy in the two discs devoted to Beethoven--including a particularly compelling account of the Thirty-Two Variations on an Original Theme in C minor, and a delightfully genial traversal of the underappreicated Rondos op. 51 (even if Lupu's lyrical approach tends to turn these works into the Impromptus Schubert never wrote).<br /><br />Throughout this set the engineers have provided oustandingly realistic piano sonorities--Lupu's prismatic play of color and tonal shadings is conveyed so vividly as to be nearly palpable. Likewise, his characteristically wide dyanamic range--from the barest whisper to majestic, and at times appropriately cruchy, fortissimos--is faithfully caught.  Given the diverse range of occasions, venues, technicians and producers involved--from the analog era to recent digital--the sound is of consistently high quality.  Occasionally (in the more recent recordings) I noticed a slight overabundance of \\"hall\\" resonance, though not so much as to blur detail.  Documentation is good; notes are brief but sufficient.<br /><br />In sum, then, this is a uniquely valuable collection, representing the considerable achievement of a pianist who must be accounted one of the very greatest of his generation.  Strongly recommended to pianophiles generally, but most of all to earnest Schubertians.Schubert, Brahms and Schumann.  Lupu's take on Beethoven is predictably but excessively rhapsodic.

B0017I0KVI|3.0|Since I've discovered how much I love Austen's 'Emma' and the characters she created, I have been on a hunt to find any sequels based on this work. There are a few out there. This author has written several other \\"diaries\\" from the view points of other Austen heroes (Mr. Darcy and Col. Brandon) and seeing as I absolutely loved Mr. Knightley I snatched this one up very quickly. It was a fairly decent read.    As the title suggests, this is Mr. Knightley's diary and we see most of the events from Emma through his eyes. Obviously things that were said or occurred when he was not present aren't mentioned (unless someone else has informed him of them) and we do see some of Knightley's activities beyond what Austen included in the original work. Some of the lines and speeches from the original are here, though many of them are cut down in length and that makes sense as this is supposed to be a diary and Mr. Knightley would not remember every single word spoken. Some may have a problem with the description of events from the original being cut down in size but again, this is a diary and Knightley is not going to record absolutely everything. I did find it interesting to see what some of his daily activities were, as we never get a hint of what his life is like away from Emma and Hartfield. In this version we see him with his gentlemen friends playing whist, at Donwell Abbey seeing to his accounts and tenants, and even a small glimpse of him visiting his brother in London. One thing I wished for more of in 'Emma' was detail on Mr. Knightley and his life and his background. While we don't get any more information on his background in this adaption than what we get in the original, we do get a glimpse of what a gentleman's daily life might have been like. It appears the author really tried to portray Knightley as close to Austen's vision of him as possible, or at least as close as possible to what an English Regency gentleman would have been like on a day to day basis. I always enjoy a look at \\"the other side of the story\\" when it comes to well known fictional characters.    All that being said there were some things that I did not like about this adaption. While I feel Grange did try to paint a believable Knightley some of the things he \\"says\\" and feels just don't ring true to me. Some of it seems a tad juvenile and I found myself thinking, \\"there is no way Mr. Knightley would have said that!\\" Some of his thoughts just did not come across as ... manly or true to his character. I was not overly fond of the way Grange shows him coming to the realization that he was in love with Emma (I really can't see Knightley sitting in a gentleman's club discussing marriages and intimate feelings with a friend). It seemed to happen in an instant, like a light bulb went on over his head, and there were no good indications of where his feelings were headed, beyond the typical \\"He just didn't like Frank Churchill...for some reason\\" type of reflections. There really was no more insight into Knightley's feelings for Emma and that is something I would have enjoyed seeing explored more. I felt there was more passion in his feelings for Emma in the original but the reader is not going to get a hint of that here; I really was hoping for more. There really just wasn't that much more to this novel than the original and I really would have enjoyed a deeper look into Knightley's character. In the original you could feel there was much more to him than what meets the eye but you just don't get that feeling here. Granted, Mr. Knightley is not \\"seen\\" nearly as much as some of the other male leads in Austen's other works so the author had to fill in a lot of gaps in the story. However, it did seem to get a bit old to hear him say (again) that he walked over to Hartfield and had an enjoyable evening. Grange also included a very bizarre situation with Miss. Bates at the end of the novel which just does not fit in with Austen's original story. I really was scratching myhead over that one!    Overall this was an enjoyable read solely for the fact that I got to see more of my beloved Mr. Knightley and it is always fun to see stories from a different point of view. There were some points that I was not fond of but it didn't detract too much from the overall narrative. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if there had been more depth to the story as I came away feeling like I didn't know that much more about Mr. Knightley as I did at the end of 'Emma.' I would recommend this to Austen fans, though the die-hard fans may have a problem with some of Mr. Knightley's thoughts here. I certainly would recommend it to those who really enjoy this new fad of spin offs and sequels based on Austen's work. It certainly does not live up to the original but it was a fun read nonetheless.
B002N8A14M|3.0|I share the frustration w/ others who have issues w/ the headphones jack not going thru' all the way in. I tried to use the headphones of the iphone so that I can use it to control the volume, skip, rewind,etc., When I tried w/ the case on those functions would not work and I assumed something wrong w/ my headphones. I tried the same headphones on a Sandisk mp3 player and it worked. So then I removed this case from the nano, plugged the headphones and now everything started working !     I had to then really push the headphones hard into the nano w/ the case on to make the volume button,etc., to work. This clearly shows the lack of quality control from Griffin. But most of the reviews for other similar cases have complained same design issue. strange !    Other than this flaw, the case is fine and the armband is fine too.
144937980X|5.0|Casey Reas and Ben Fry, the principal developers of the Processing Programming language have developed a well illustrated and well described introduction to graphical programming in Processing taking a similar approach to Massimo Banzi's \\"Getting Started with Arduino\\".  Written for the Artist and others who might be intimidated by a traditional programming text Reas and Fry first give a brief illustrated introduction to graphical programming and Processing (6 pages), and then proceed gently to illustrations and program listings of how one draws circles lines and triangles in just a few lines of code.  By the end of this compact, well illustrated and non-intimidating 195 page introduction the reader regardless of his/her former background will be producing sophisticated art work in Processing and mixing Processing graphical applications with simple electronic interfaces based upon the Arduino Physical Computing platform. The book is carefully divided into 2-4 page graphically illustrated examples that enable the development of new skills in drawing, animating and interfacing with the computer.  This exceptionally clear and non-threatening introduction has several unique features: 1.  It is directed at the Artist or non-technical individual, 2. It allows Drawing, Animating, and Building User Interfaces with the computer, 3. Based on the Processing Language a simple easy-to-learn graphical subset of Java it introduces the non-technical individual to a common C-like Java-based language rather than a specialized \\"kiddie\\" interface like \\"Scratch\\", 4. It combines an introduction to graphical programming with the easy Physical Computing tools of Arduino to allow the artist to create Interactive Exhibitions.<br /><br />This is the perfect introduction for an Artist, Talented Child, or Graphically-Oriented Non-Technical Individual to Create their own<br />Artwork or Compositions with Simple Yet-Powerful Programming Tools and learn the best Integration between an Artistic Culture and Modern Technology.<br /><br />--Ira Laefsky<br />MSE/MBA Human Computer Interaction Researcher and Consultantrn Technology.    --Ira Laefsky   MSE/MBA Human Computer Interaction Researcher and Consultant

I'd become frustrated quickly, because the accepted progression of building the book did not at all mesh with the way that I think.    I've had this book on my shelf for ten years, and finally cracked it earlier this week. By the time I was finished reading, I was so excited to get to work on my own manuscript! For the first time, a plan for writing made sense to me, and I've started my first novel with anticipation, instead of fear.    Thank you, Mr. King!

This seems like one of the \\"It\\" books of the season and I see why.  Don't go in looking for serious literature but do pick it up if you want an enjoyable read that comments on growing into an adult in the late 90s, early 00s.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought the FiiO E5 since my Samsung Galaxy S phone had a relatively quiet volume. It has an OUTSTANDING sound chip and with the Equalizers I installed I could get very high quality sound out of it but I had to pre-amp it down in volume in order to boost certain frequencies a good 10db or so and prevent clipping. This being said, it sounded great but I wish I could restore the 10db I lost due to my pre-amp for those moments where you feel you want music SO loud nothing else in the universe is audible...you know, the moments which really kill your hearing but make you \\"wow\\" at the sheer power.    That being said, here are my remarks about the Fiio E5. Note that I am an audiophile and am comparing it to high-end equipment (my computer is an X-Fi hooked to a Sennheiser 595 Audiophile headphones and my in-ear headphones are also quite high-end).    Pros:  -LOUD. For a headphone amp, this sure AMPLIFIES. 95db or so just as advertised. Note that it is independent of frequencies...you can pump mostly bass from your source device and the FiiO E5 will take that and AMPLIFY it to the 95db or so where a good headphone/earphone WILL rattle your ears (LITERALLY...you WILL feel vibrations). All depends on your source though.  -Ergonomics. The thing is SOLID. Full metal case and feels as if though I can run it over with a car and it will be good. It is \\"done right\\" as some may say. Buttons are small yet very accessible and power on/off is designed JUST right. Props to FiiO with the design of this thing. An added bonus is the tiny blue led when on and red when charging. It goes purple when its on and charging :)  -Flat vs Bass mode. It has a little switch that turns on an equalizer. Bass mode works just as the name suggests. It boosts about 4db of ~50Hz bass to your source. It may also mess with other higher frequencies but the effect is minimal. It will not replace an equalizer by any means. All it can do is give you a little \\"oomph\\" and \\"boom\\" to your music if your equalizer isstruggling. However, if you combine it with a bass-boosted EQ, the bass boost can be MASSIVE. I was able to COMPLETELY drown ANY music and produce just intense rattling when I did such a combination. Not that I want to listen to it but it is capable of doing so. As for bass quality, I would say it is CLEAN and sharp mostly. It will depend on your headphones but given good ones, you will definitely hear and FEEL it.  -Added clip is amazing. It clips to your clothes and stays put. You can clip it on your belt and plug headphones there. It will take you a few minutes to find a technique that works for you but once you do, you will be pleasantly suprised. The clip allows you to use your source music player as you would normally, without the amp hanging places or tangling wires.    Cons:  -Hiss. I was expecting this but was still shocked a little. The amp suffers from a static \\"hiss\\" when it's volume is turned up but the source's volume is relatively low. Listening like that can become annoying fast. In order to fix the hiss problem you need to max the volume on your input device and turn the amp down some. The hiss is then almost gone. Note that with most music and at anything except very quiet volumes, you will not notice the hiss and can listen with the amp's volume fully up, adjusting the input volume as needed.  -Extra cheap wires. Not really a problem of the amp itself but the wires that come with it are of poor quality. They get the job done but that's all they do. I suppose for $20 you should NOT be expecting more. You also get more wires as you have this amp inbetween the source and your headphones so it can on occasion become messy if you don't familiarize yourself a good technique. Hint: USE THE CLIP!!  -Advertised to last only 20 hours per charge. Yes, the unit is TINY (just a tad bigger than an ipod shuffle). Yes, it has a fully rechargable lithium battery. Yes its fast to recharge. The fact remains though you may likely need to recharge it every 2 or 3 daysdepending on listening habits. BUY a socket USB adapter. This ONLY comes with a cable...hence initially you can charge it only from computers (shame really). Buy a wall USB adapter or a car USB adapter and you will be set.      For $20, this is a GREAT product. Great volume output, can add bass, perfect ergonomics for portable device, clip, rechargeable battery, stylish. If you need any of those things, The FiiO E5 is the right product for you. If your music device is already loud, the FiiO likely won't make a difference (for example Ipods or computers with decent sound cards). It CAN add a little bass if you're missing that. If you have a QUALITY music player with a good equalizer, the FiiO can take that and turn it into an AMAZING sound setup.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I thought Kiss Ass was AwEsOmE. If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action and violence then this is the movie for you. I was so happy to see that this movie was different than most super hero movies. It had a lot more action in it and the super hero characters portrayed a different role as well. Hit Girl was amazing in this movie. It's nice to see that children can be a super hero as well. I would also like to add that this movie isnt just for the men. It's entertaining enough to keep women on the edge of their seats as well.    WARNING: There is a lot of blood and violence in this movie. Also there is a little girl who kills and uses profanity. If any of this bothers you then you should pass on watching this Awesome movie.    If none of the above bothers you then check out Kick Ass today...you won't be disappointed.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Most movies these days bore me to tears because the scripts are banal.  Inception is an exception to the rule.  I can see where some people might get confused by the multilevel dream thread, but I think the editor did a good job reminding us of the original and subordinate dreams.  If you can, or better yet want, to keep up with it all then this is a fun ride.  I'll agree with the critique that it is too darn long.  A one star hit from me because I think thirty minutes should have been edited out.  That said, I can see where the filmmakers maybe cleverly wanted to pull the audience into the effect of the exponential increase in time for each dream level.  Honestly it didn't feel like 2.5 hours to me, but my wife said it did to her.  This is a very unique movie and I enjoyed it thoroughly...a rarity in these times of cookie-cutter formula movies.  Bottom line: highly recommended.

B000O77SRC|5.0|My original thought was that this movie was just mindless action, and boy was I wrong! This movie made me want to start watching more action movies. Bruce Willis does a great job playing the New York cop John Mclain!         The main plot of the movie is that John Mclain's wife takes a job in California and so they rarely get to see each other. He decides to fly in over Christmas break so he goes to her office Christmas party only to be caught up in a robbery by genius businessmen. Can he keep them at bay until the police arrive or will they hunt him down and rid themselves of the threat he possessed?          Overall this movie is easily a 5 star movie, and I now know why Bruce Willis is considered one of the best action film actors, right up there with the likes of Arnold S., and Sylvester Stallone! Great job Willis!!!
B002GIBVWA|1.0|Only someone who has never seen the original could like this flick. It takes a wonderful bittersweet story and butchers it. No comparison. Whereas the original is full of surprises and has you rooting for things to work out somehow, and leaves you heartbroken, this slop has nothing to offer except to note that Charlize Theron sure is a looker! Oh, and Keanu Reeves sure is boring. Two thumbs and two big toes down. Skip it.

Yes, I've seen Inception 3 freakin times...can't help myself. So I Took A Leap Of Faith and bought the soundtrack...I poo you not, it's playing in my head Right Now!    As much as I love this score, I must give Bjork her just dues. Listen to Bjork's \\"Pagan Poetry\\", and then listen to the Inception score. Mr Zimmer has taken a few cues from the Icelandic Super Sprite! Maybe he's in love with Bjork too!   Anyway, I would recommend this awesome score to anyone..I have almost 40, and this is instantly one of my favorites.

The tape I purchased here 8/10 plays flawlessly.<br /><br />HATARI! (1962) is a gorgeous Technicolor adventure set in old Tanganiyka, the sort of movie that, because of modern restrictions against animal abuse, will never be made again. Scenes here of catching alive a stampeding wildebeast, giraffe and rhino are not simulations. Men using jeeps and trucks race alongside terrorized galloping animals and skillfully slip ropes around their necks. It's a most impressive thing to see, if somewhat cruel.<br /><br />Injuries are common to this line of endeavor. In the opening hunt sequence, Bruce Cabot (as 'Indian') is horned in the thigh by an enraged rhino. He nearly bleeds to death during a five hour trip to the nearest hospital and is left permanently disabled by the wound.<br /><br />Weakest element is the romantic pairing of 27-year-old Elsa Martinelli with Sean Mercer (Wayne), a man twice her age. As with most Hollywood scripts of that era, their union, however unlikely, is inevitable. Here, the Italian fashion model is 'Dallas,' a photographer newly arrived from a Swiss zoo whose purpose is to take snaps of critters being snagged on the hoof. To do so, she must bump along the dusty African plains with Sean and crew.<br /><br />The greenhorn in their midst quickly becomes a seasoned safari vet.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|First the movie - This version I'd rate at 4.5, as I felt it was much stronger version of the book (mostly due to Sally Hawkins) and had they been able to use some of the actors from the 2007 version (notable Capt. Wentworth) this could have been even better. (Sadly the 2007 had a superior cast in most respects, but a lesser script).    But I gave it a 5****, for my own stupid reason - the box. I own 560 DVDs and this is the most beautiful case I've seen, let alone own. BBC has hardbound it, so that it actually looks like a book. It's funny because when you see the pictures of the Harry Potter or James Bond \\"Collectors\\" sets, they actually turn out to be cheap cardboard boxes. If this was set on a shelf of books, you wouldn't know it was a DVD. Amazing packaging.

0307454541|3.0|I *had* to read this book based on all the hype surrounding this series.<br /><br />Crime fiction is not normally the type of book I read, this resulting in my having to read slower to understand what I was reading.  I know this book is Swedish, but the references to different streets and towns added to the confusion.  Plus the author kept referring to people by their last name, and sometimes by first name.  I had a hard time keeping the supporting characters straight.<br /><br />The plot was just ok for me.  I felt most of it was predictable.  By the end of the book I was invested in Lisbeth and Mickael and ready to read the next book.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|...if this disc actually contains the 13 minute additional clip that was alluded to by one of the LOST cast members when they started hitting the talk show circuit? (I believe it was 'Ben' and 'Locke' that mentioned it.) Not just a \\"what was it like to play...\\" but a REAL SEGMENT that was added to further the explanation of what happened to Ben and Hurley at the end.    Product description says: \\"Go deeper into the world of LOST with a much-anticipated NEW CHAPTER of the island's story... and starring some very familiar faces.\\"    This is a practical issue for me. If there is a \\"NEW CHAPTER\\" with the actors acting and not just talking about their acting, then I will buy the episode. If not, I won't bother.    Since the product description is deliberately coy, I'm guessing there IS nothing new, just rehash. Does anyone know different?

B003L20IDS|5.0|Next to Inception and Predators, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World was my most anticipated film of the year. Edgar Wright  has yet to disappoint as a director and the film looked like it would feature plenty of comedy and action with a little bit of romance that would be presented in a unique way that would hopefully satisfy that part of me that always seems to be craving something more original from Hollywood. Thankfully, like a child who has a strong idea of what that big Christmas present is sitting under the tree, that's exactly what I received.<br /><br />The entire film looks fantastically retro as certain sounds are brought to life with animated text while weapons the characters use are heavily pixelated like they're taken straight out of an 8-bit video game. Scott Pilgrim recycles recognizable video game sounds in a way that triggers nostalgia, but uses them in a way that feels fresh. Even the way the film is edited like the way the split screen is used to show all seven evil exes on screen at once in the trailer or how Scott's everyday activities bleed together because he's so absorbed in his thoughts about Ramona seems to be done in a way that makes the film stand out in comparison to others.<br /><br />The writing may be Scott Pilgrim's best attribute. There are so many witty one-liners littered throughout the film and the storyline unfolds in a way that grabs hold of your attention the second that 8-bit version of the Universal Logo comes up on screen and doesn't let go until those last remaining seconds of the film. The cast was surprisingly solid, as well. I was already excited about Chris Evans and Jason Schwartzman being in the film, but Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Kieran Culkin all managed to make a pretty lasting impression with this film.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is one of the most inventive, cleverly written, eye-popping, and visually appealing action comedies to ever grace the big screen. While Edgar Wright's best work can certainly be debated, Scott Pilgrim is arguably his most enjoyable work yet.debated, Scott Pilgrim is arguably his most enjoyable work yet.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|After reading The Lightning Thief, I decided to see the movie adaptation.  To my dismay, the movie was a disappointment.  In general, it doesn't bother me when film makers change a book's original story when adapting it to the screen.  As long as it has a good story and interesting characters, I'm happy.  This is where the movie The Lightning Thief went wrong.    It seems the film ignored the strong storyline of the book, and instead of progressing in its own unique direction, the film substituted the potential quality of its story with flashy fight scenes, shallow dialogue, and static characters.  It's just another shallow adaptation of a thoughtful, complex book.  Rent it if you must see it.  Not worth buying.
030726999X|3.0|This book took me what felt like forever to get through.<br /><br />The drama of the third in Larsson's series was streched out and I couldn't wait to get to the end, just so it would be finished.  Normally I don't want a book to end...
0316067938|4.0|I just finished reading Breaking Dawn today. I am a 39 year old mother of an 11 year old who read it a little before me.    I think this book did a wonderful job of finishing all of the loose ends from the first books, handling the sexuality tastefully, and keeping me guessing till the very end.    I'm a little surprised by all the one star reviews, as a writer myself, I know how hard it is to create and sustain a plot and characters with half of the depth presented here.    I think that there are alot of folks who got a little too invested in these characters, and have very unrealistic expectations that may not have been possible to meet under any circumstances.    I especially loved the section narrated by Jacob . . . first because he is such a loveable and warm character and second because he tells it like it is, no holding back!    If you read the book to be entertained and remember that it is targeted to YOUNG PEOPLE not jaded adult fiction critics, you will have a better experience I think.    My daughter said it was her favorite book in the series and I would say that it certainly held its own.    P.S. While I was a little worried about some of the \\"sexual content\\" of the book, Bella's experiences bring Renesme into the world certainly provide a cautionary counterbalance. . . and the name Renesme grew on me, but it took some getting used too! lol

B003XKPPOU|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\" was about sibling rivalry. \\"Toy Story 2\\" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.<br /><br />So what is \\"Toy Story 3\\" about? It takes the whole \\"kids + loyal toys\\" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br />Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager. His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.<br /><br />They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the \\"Caterpillar Room\\" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.<br /><br />You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. \\"Toy Story 3\\" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.<br /><br />But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex \\"Great Escape\\"-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.<br /><br />And there's a bittersweet core to \\"Toy Story 3\\": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.<br /><br />And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.<br /><br />Anyway, this blu-ray/DVD combo has a wealth of extras -- trailers teasers, theatrical shorts (oh look, Night and Day are scuffling!), \\"Cine-emplore,\\" commentary, lots of making-ofs, behind the scenes stuff like \\"A Toy's Eye View: Creating A Whole New Land,\\" a music video, and just lots of endearing odds and ends like Ken's dating tips. Er...<br /><br />It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|I've been listening to Avenged Sevenfold ever since I first heard Chapter Four on a video game. I own and enjoy all of their albums. I picked this up the day of it's release, expecting it to be comparable to the self-titled. Personally, I've been blown away. Although not something totally out of the norm for them, this album has already become my favorite A7X album. God Hates Us really blew me away, hearing Shadows even sound like the lead singer from Divine Heresy at one point, proving he still has range.     Fiction gave me chills, and is a great song, in my opinion. To be able to hear The Rev's voice for the last time, even if they were demo recordings, was great. It was a very fitting farewell to a great musician. The last song, Save Me, is probably my favorite. It has some really great lyrics, and ends the album with an somewhat creepy, yet fitting sendoff.     There isn't a song on this album I can say anything bad about. The guys really outdid themselves in my opinion. It really is a testament to how dedicated to the fans, and the Rev, they really are to have fought through the emotions to get this album out. Can't wait to see where things go from here!
B002VECLVO|4.0|In the ironically titled \\"A Single Man,\\" a movie based on the Christopher Isherwood novel of the same name, the protagonist George Falconer (Colin Firth) is a gay college professor whose partner of 16 years (Matthew Goode) has recently been killed in a car crash.  As it is 1962, George has lived almost his entire life in the closet - and now he's even being forced to grieve in isolation.  To make matters worse, his lover`s parents won`t allow George to attend the memorial service, and now he has to return to work acting as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened in his life - as if his heart had not just been ripped out of him by the thoughtless cruelty of an indifferent Fate.  The one person with whom George can be truly open and honest about himself is Charley (Julianne Moore), a longtime female friend who accepts his homosexuality but whose own conflicted feelings for the man greatly complicate their relationship.  Yet, George has his own conflicted feelings to deal with, when, in the depths of his despair, one of his young male students (Nicholas Hoult) begins to make romantic overtures to him.<br /><br />Rather than tell the story, which takes place over the course of a 24-hour period, in a strictly linear and straightforward fashion, Tom Ford, in his directorial debut, relies heavily on intense close-ups, visual tinting, voiceover narration, dream sequences, flashbacks, memories, imaginings and endless images of ticking clocks - signifying the slow but inexorable passage of time - to give a more fragmented and otherworldly quality to the story.  However, such an approach, impressive as it is at times, carries some risks with it as well - for the artiness frequently acts as a distancing device that prevents us from entering the mind and feelings of the protagonist as fully as we would like to.  That being said, the style does provide an interesting visual correlative to the life of secrecy and repression George is being forced to lead by a society that, still at that point, was not quite ready to accept anyone who might threaten its self-proscribed parameters of what, in its infinite wisdom, it chose to deem as \\"acceptable\\" and \\"normal.\\"<br /><br />Oddly, with Firth's heavy British accent, the uncharacteristically deep-hued interiors and airless exteriors, this is one of the few movies set in L.A. that doesn't really feel like it takes place in L.A. (it's reminiscent of \\"The Man From Elysian Fields\\" in that regard).  Indeed, the movie has more of an East Coast/Old World European flavor to it that further works to dislocate the viewer.<br /><br />As an actor, Colin Firth has never before shown such intensity of purpose or subtlety of technique, playing a man whose outward actions are basically a shield for what is happening deep inside the soul of the character.  Firth conveys a wealth of meaning through random facial expressions and understated gestures, as he portrays a man coping with both the tragic loss of his one true love and the burden of conducting a lifelong masquerade to avoid offending the sensibilities of others.<br /><br />In form and in style, \\"A Single Man\\" is more a mood piece than a fully developed drama, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is taking place in the background, casting a portentous pall over the lives and futures of the people involved.  But it is through George's highly specific yet universal story that the film movingly conveys the tragedy of living a life so dedicated to being false to others that one can never be true to oneself.that point, was not quite ready to accept anyone who might threaten its self-proscribed parameters of what, in its infinite wisdom, it chose to deem as \\"acceptable\\" and \\"normal.\\"    Oddly, with Firth's heavy British accent, the uncharacteristically deep-hued interiors and airless exteriors, this is one of the few movies set in L.A. that doesn't really feel like it takes place in L.A.

B0018O4YT0|1.0|I heard about this movie several years back and it looked pretty interesting and I was fairly impressed by the large amounts of positive reviews it got, and luckily for me, I found the whole movie on YouTube, so I didn't even have to invest one dollar at the local Family Video.  I finally found the time to watch it about a month ago and boy was this a deplorable flick.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />The story for Dark City is that John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) finds himself in a bathtub with a murdered prostitute, and gets a phone call from Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) claiming he can help him find his identity, all the while Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelley) claiming to be John's wife along with detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and a bunch of pale bald people called the  \\"Strangers\\" chasing John down.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />One of the things that really does Dark City in is that the characters are really shallow and uninteresting.  I didn't care about a single one of them as the movie went along since they were all nothing but ultra-conventional plot devices.  John is the typical semi-geeky antihero, his supposed wife is the initially shady character that you know will switch to the protagonist's side towards the end, and the same can be said for Frank.  Of course, the Strangers are typical stock villains with little background, and whatever background is given to them is done only through tacky exposition.  The Strangers were laughably pathetic since they're not intimidating whatsoever, they look like a goofy cross between Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies and Uncle Fester from The Addams Family, and best of all, they gather in a large mass and chatter their teeth.  The occasional bursts of unintentional laughter kept me from falling asleep.<br /><br />BAD ACTING<br /><br />No one really seems to put any effort into their roles in this turkey.  The most notable culprits for hamming things up are Sutherland and Hurt, with the former doing a really bad Peter Lorre impersonation throughout the film, and the latter acting as stale and emotionless as possible (Hurt would commit another serious offense in 1998 with that other sci-fi abomination Lost in Space).  The others aren't any better and aren't worth my reviewing effort.<br /><br />LACK OF ORIGINALITY<br /><br />I'm not against movies being derivative so long as they can overcome their lack of originality by contributing something worthwhile and memorable to the plate (such as Event Horizon).  However, with Dark City, you get nothing that you haven't seen before (and done much better in previous films). The city where this movie takes place looks like it was taken right out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil and Fritz Lang's Metropolis complete with Gothic skyscrapers and with everything being part of the \\"retro-future\\" gimmick (including attire, with many people wearing fedora hats).  The whole angle of John trying to find his identity was done MUCH BETTER in the Paul Verhoeven masterpiece Total Recall, along with the whole \\"alternate reality/what's real and what's not\\" theme being done much better in TR. Director Alex Proyas even takes elements from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira.  The Strangers do this thing every midnight called \\"tuning,\\" which is where they swap the memories and lives of the inhabitants and use their powers to physically change the environment, complete with the skyscrapers building themselves (taken from the ending of the Akira manga).  Also, with the overly tacky deus ex machina plot resolver in the form of a needle that gives John the same psychic power as the Strangers, it makes John's character resemble Tetsuo Shima from Akira.  Fans have defended these acts of Proyas being derivative and claimed it's \\"homage\\" to said works.  I don't mind homage, but it's all to clear that Proyas fed off other works just so he didn't have to create anything on his own.<br /><br />STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE<br /><br />If you haven't caught on already, Alex Proyas thinks that you can coast through a movie with nice-looking production sets while having nothing else worthwhile.  Granted, the sets for this movie do look pretty impressive, but as stated before, they can't substitute bland characters or ultra-conventional plotting.  The supposedly \\"dark\\" element isn't even that intimidating since it's just constantly dark out, there's no layers of griminess in the setting to unnerve the audience.  Everything, visually speaking, looks too shiny and polished for a movie that's supposed to be \\"dark.\\"  I bet that when Proyas was creating Dark City, he was speaking to himself \\"Yeah!!  I'm gonna make a retro-future setting where all the technology is set in the 1920's and everyone's wearing vintage clothing!!  It's gonna be so cool because many people are gonna think it's different!!\\"  It's all to clear that Proyas ripped off the \\"retro-future\\" setting from Brazil and Metropolis just for the sake of being different from the typical sci-fi aesthetics during the 90's.<br /><br />UNDERSERVED PRAISE<br /><br />For reasons I can't comprehend, droves of people are calling this one of the best movies ever.  Roger Ebert even chose Dark City as his pick for the best movie of 1998 (and this is another reason why I'm rapidily loosing respect for Ebert, but that's another kettle of fish).  Can't you see the clear derivative nature of the film and how shallow the plot and characters are?  I guess I'm thinking too hard about that since trying to find logic and reason in this area is all for naught.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Don't believe the hype on this one.  This is NOT the cult retro-future sci-fi masterpiece that people are claiming it to be.  You're better off watching Mission of Darkness (if you're 18+), which is one of the most poorly made (story and production-wise) and all around downright terrible anime porn titles in existence.  I guarantee that it'll be much more entertaining than Dark City will be.<br /><br />Don't fall for this shallow copy and just go for Brazil and Metropolis.as thinks that you can coast through a movie with nice-looking production sets while having nothing else worthwhile.

I truly believe it should be mandatory reading for our Executive and Legislative electees and for any American who seeks true enlightenment about this war.

Awesome reading!

0375842209|5.0|A very interesting twist on a story...\\"Death\\" is the narrator.  This book is marketed for teens, but don't overlook this 550 page novel assuming it is something too juvenile to read.  This story has many different paths that eventually bring the reader to an emotional conclusion.  Another rare and unique story that you experience from the perspective of the German citizens.  The story is fiction, but the history is genuine.  Many people still believe that all Germans were Nazis or Nazi supporters.  This is very far from the truth.  Many German citizens were forced to along with the rules thrust upon them by the Wehrmacht in hopes to ensure their family's safety.  These rules were enforced by the Gestapo, SS and particularly, the faction of the SS called the  Einsatzgruppen.  The Einsatzgruppen was referred to as the \\"death squad\\" and they were responsible for the execution of countless German citizens who were caught aiding Jews in any way, as well as anyone believed to be a Communist or gypsy.  The German citizens were desperate for food and rations during the waning days of the war, again not a widely known fact.  A great story paired with great lessons in history and definitely a must read.
1439102937|1.0|I grabbed this one in an airport expecting a \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" or \\"Nanny Diaries\\" fun chick-lit.  I've read some bad chick-lit in my days, but usually there's humor or a little drama to carry you through.  This one dragged on, with little humor, and not a speck of drama.      You see, when I read a book about 20-30 year old urban women, I like to see a little of myself in them, a little sassy, a little flawed.  I like to see characters that grow.  And while every character can't be Bridget Jones, I like to laugh a little too.  If you like these things, don't read this book.    One character is neurotic, and we watch her be neurotic for most of the book, which could be funny, but is not.  Then she makes a decision (I won't ruin it) and stops being neurotic.  Very dramatic.    The second character is a recent dumpee, and we watch her be depressed, and try to change her dating habits... and eventually she does, unceremoniously, but turns back into her old self by the end.      The third character is the worst!  She's beautiful, and rich, and treats men like toys, and always gets what she wants. She's also a crappy friend.  We watch her be whiney and spoiled and bitchy, and in the end she still gets it all: fame, fortune, romance.... Um, what's entertaining about perfect?
0684853523|5.0|This is an incredible book on writing by one of the most popular writers of the last 30 years. It would be easy to dismiss King as merely a popular writer and ignore this book. But to do so would be to miss out on an incredible learning experience from \\"Professor\\" King.    I found King's advice helpful and insightful. His advice against plotting really opened up worlds for me in terms of how to write fiction. This has always been a block whenever I have attempted to pick up pen and write. I get frustrated and give up because I don't know where the darn thing is going. King's argument is that writing is like excavating. You use the tools of language and grammar and such to excavate characters that are already there. The plot follows. But to use plot to excavate is to use a hammer to dig up fossils -- not a good idea.    I also found the personal anecdotes and King's autobiography fascinating. I have actually never read a whole King book so much of this was new for me. (I believe I read part of [[ASIN:0451169522 Misery]] at one point, but I don't think I finished it.) This book is definitely worth reading and owning!
0375704027|5.0|I want to put in my own two cents here.  There are other reviews which cover the novel in more depth.<br /><br />First: I find this translation pretty amazing.  I read a lot of Asian literature and know that poor translation (Brothers ~ Yu Hua) can tarnish what is a sterling story.  I have also read virtually every Murakami novel, many more than once.  I do enjoy the variety of translations, but I find that Jay Rubin is the best, especially with the newer novels.<br /><br />Unlike other Murakami works, this contains no mystical creatures, weird capitalist mascots, or alternate dimensions.  I recommend this novel but remark that it differs greatly from his other works.
0312330537|3.0|If I met the protagonist, Linbaba, in the flesh, I'd, well, I'd beg my meatiest friend to rough him up. Repeatedly. Lin's adventures in Bombay are apparently based on humble author Gregory David Roberts's exploits playing savior and mafiosi there while in hiding after a daring New Zealand prison escape. LinBaba becomes irksome and tiresome after Part 1, repeatedly offering little nuggets of pseudowisdom to summarize what he has learned from a particular person or situation. (I actually really despise the aforementioned phrase \\"nugget of wisdom\\" but I find it accurate here to really emphasize the fact that these \\"nuggets\\" are fleeting and become utterly meaningless because there are apx. 10 per page). Along with the wisdom, most of the novel consists of the protagonist vacillating between moral extremes as either a savior of street and slum or a thug loyal to a Bombay mafia don. For all of these roles, and all of the blurring of good and evil, though, the novel still comes up short in terms of complexity --- in thought, theme, and characterization. I particularly found Lin's trust and god-like admiration of Khader, his mafia boss and father figure, too simplistic and naive.  Everything was just a bit too dizzying and dazzling, like Roberts knew this was going to be picked up by Hollywood. Lin insists upon showing readers that he has connections in all of Bombay's divergent milieus --- from Bollywood, to the slums, to the mafia, to the expats and the heroin dens, LinBaba knows all. He even goes to Afghanistan in the midst of the Soviet invasion. This novel needs more unity and focus; moving from one incident to another, with a bit of wisdom in between, gets tedious and vexing.    All that negativity aside, this was a grand adventure story and was, for all my complaints, entertaining. Roberts obviously has a flair for dialogue, capturing the dialects of German, French, and Indian speakers, and Prabaker, Lin's best friend in Bombay, is a standout character. Actually, hewas the best part of the novel for me, and far more realistic and entertaining than anyone else.

This book has provided a good introduction to the topic of understanding body language.  I feel as though I'm ready to learn more now that I have the basics.  I highly recommend to anyone new to the idea of wanting to interpret body language.
0312370849|3.0|When I first started reading Sarah's Key, I was impressed with the intensity of the story and how the author juggled two different storylines at the same time. I liked that the chapters were short and that seemed to move the story along quickly. However, as the story developed the author simply disappointed. She created a main character that isn't really likable, who's actions simply don't make sense, and all in all I felt like I was reading a novel about a lifetime movie where the woman follows her heart's often ridiculous impulses without consideration for others or herself. The ending was disappointing. The definition of anti-climactic and more than a bit cliche. Definitely recommend borrowing this book versus buying it if you're still inclined to read it.
B003X73QA8|3.0|Third albums are problematic. They are often viewed -- rightly or wrongly -- as the make-or-break point for musical artists. Take Bruce Springsteen, for example. His first two albums displayed a distinctive viewpoint and style (or styles: is there anybody that guy didn't steal from?) and lots of promise, but it wasn't enough. His label was ready to drop him. He was discouraged. It had been two years since his second album failed to chart. Then in 1975 \\"Born to Run\\"  finally propelled him into the zeitgeist. His real masterpiece, \\"Darkness at the Edge of Town,\\" didn't appear till three years later, but it didn't matter: he was already in the public consciousness.    Now we come to Arcade Fire, easily the most exciting act to come down the pike in the last ten years. Anticipation, needless to say, was high after the artistic achievement previously displayed. So what have we got? I defy anybody to listen to \\"No Cars Go\\" or \\"Keep the Car Running\\" and say any of the tracks on \\"The Suburbs,\\" except, perhaps, \\"Ready to Start,\\" compare to them in any way -- save where they might be similar in structure or melody to those earlier, superior efforts. Disappointing, to the point where a decent 3-star album might get docked a star for being so. However, I will confess that after (1) a few more listenings, and (2) attending one of their recent -- electrifying -- LA shows, which was liberally peppered with this new material, I anticipate their fourth with as much excitement as I had for this one.

0307454541|3.0|I do not understand the hype surrounding this book at all! I'm not sure if the book is bad because of the translation or because it's just bad. The main character is a borderline sex addict sleeping with anything that moves. The author seems to want to make the case that casual sex doesn't have an effect on people. I guess, he's just deciding to ignore the science on that one.  The guy has a long time lover who stays married and just sort of floats between Mike and her husband. In the meantime, he's getting some from the mature and immature alike. In short,  the guy seems to have impulse control problems.<br />Then there's the plot. It's not terribly innovative, or ingenious. It is rather superfluous in it's structure and wording. In a 600-page book, there is about 200 pages of interesting happenings.<br />Salender is a sympathetic character caught somewhere on the Autism spectrum but other than that, the characters are rather flat and predictable. The plot is also rather predictable. There were exactly two places where I was caught off guard. One was a big caught off guard; the other was rather minor movement that probably happened because I dropped into hyper skim mode.<br />I kept thinking to myself how happy I was that I borrowed the book from the library on a whim.<br />And yet...<br />...I'll probably borrow the second book and read it, maybe. I'm not sure what that says about the book or me.<br />I'll have to give it three stars though because I do intend to give the sequel a shot.
0307454541|5.0|I'm often disappointed when I finally succumb to frenzied hype about a book, but this series opener lived up to expectations.  This is the story of two unusual people: Lisbeth Salander, a young woman who's been victimized by the system and is now a ward of the state, an antisocial hacker who presents a compelling, if not charming, persona; and Mikael Blomqvist, a journalist with principles (eerily similar to the author :-).  Blomqvist has recently been found guilty of libelling a shady Swedish businessman, and he's been hired by a dying millionaire to pretend to write a family history while actually trying to find out what really happened to his beloved niece 40 years ago, when she disappeared during a family reunion. Eventually these two characters team up to solve the mystery, and an odd friendship is begun and tested as the mystery deepens.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I found the writing superb and the dialogue fun.  There are many many characters who populate the lives of our two main protagonists, and they are as complex and (almost) as interesting as Blomqvist and Salander.  This is an epic world Larsson has created.  While ten books were planned, three have been published and one is unfinished.  This is a tremendous loss to the literary world when you appreciate how vast this world was, and wonder what the author had planned for this host of Swedes.<br /><br />There are lots of characters, and many have similar names -- this makes for confusion at times, but there is no other problem with these terrific books.  Not for the squeamish, there is subdued sex and intense violence.  And many sandwiches and coffees are consumed.
0439023483|4.0|What a fun, fast and furious read! I'm a 40-year-old father, and I loved \\"Hunger Games\\". My ten-year-old son loved \\"Hunger Games\\". And I'm betting my wife and 13-year-old daughter will love it too.    Katniss Everdeen lives in a North America of the near future. In this future, the American government punishes past rebellions by forcing two teenagers from each of its 12 districts to compete in an all-or-nothing competition that can have only one winner. Only one Tribute will survive...all other competitors must be eliminated...as in dead.    This isn't author Suzanne Collins' first go-around with a bestselling series. She's also written the \\"Underland Chronicles\\" and it's clear she knows how to weave an intricate story in an uncomplicated way. She does a terrific job at setting her characters' tone and depth by providing just the right amount of back-story and emotional insight in just the right doses.    \\"Hunger Games\\" scores high due to a few factors:    It's emotional: By slowly exposing Katniss' character over the course of the entire book, Collins creates a completely three-dimensional individual. She's tough and strong, vulnerable and needy, and not once does her motivation or action feel inconsistent with her personality. Katniss' emotions are powered by her love for her sister, her growing in-game romance, and the strength of the the relationships that orbit her world.    It's thrilling: This ultimate game of hide-and-go-seek feels completely plausible. The action is paced extremely well...flowing smoothly from one intense scene to the next, interspersed with an appropriate amount of recovery time. All of the action is laced with Katniss' inner monologue that successfully conveys the thinking and emotion of a teenage girl caught in her circumstance. The games are violent, but I didn't feel inappropriately so considering a young reader starting at age 9 or 10.    It's got strong characters: Collins has surrounded Katniss with a number of bright, bold and entertaining characters. A real strength of the story is how well the characters are fleshed-out no matter how much ink each receives. Peeta is Katniss' co-Tribute from her District and he plays an extremely important part in Katniss' growth and survival. Haymitch is deftly portrayed as the often-drunk former Games champion who coaches Katniss and Peeta. Cinna is Katniss' make-up and costume designer, and makes a strong impression within very minimal time in the story.    I very much enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to diving into its sequels. As soon as my son is done.

0307474712|3.0|I liked the concept of this novel, but didn't think it always worked.  I found myself sometimes going back to previous chapters to remember what had happened and was occasionally confused.  The characters are, as others here have pointed out, fairly unlikeable throughout most of the book, especially Dexter.  I borrowed this book from a friend and in discussion of it, we both commented that it seems like over 20 years both characters would have learned something about themselves and how to deal with life and their relationships.  It seems like the book is being advertised as a light-hearted humorous story and it really isn't most of the time, unless you are amused by alcoholism and stupidity.  There were funny moments, but it isn't what I would characterize as light in the way that most \\"chick-lit\\" type novels are.  Dexter's drinking and drug-taking are depressing, and his skating through life on charm, as well as his astounding self-centeredness, makes me despise him.  Emma never seems to learn how to experience joy and have some fun in life and her relationship with Ian is so sad.<br /><br />What I did like in the book is the idea that one small action or moment can determine the course of a life.  If Dexter had mailed the letter, what would have happened?  There are other such questions at various points in the book.  If their timing had been better could they have avoided some things or people?  This to me is a very interesting proposition and it's what kept me reading.  As I said above I did not find the characters particularly engaging, and I don't find alcoholism charming at all.  Dexter's terrible night with his infant daughter made me shudder.<br /><br />Additionally, I thought the ending was jarring and out of character with the rest of the book.  It seemed like the author was trying a last-ditch effort to get the reader to care about the characters.  It didn't work that way with me.  I felt manipulated.<br /><br />I'm not sure how they will do the movie of this book - maybe they will lighten it up a little so it can play as a romantic comedy, but I sure hope they can make it work because I can see this being a real disaster if they don't.  Anne Hathaway is charming but I don't know if that is enough to make the story palatable.this book - maybe they will lighten it up a little so it can play as a romantic comedy, but I sure hope they can make it work because I can see this being a real disaster if they don't.

1400031524|3.0|My third KW novel, and although I enjoyed it, it was not as good as Faceless Killers or The Man Who Smiled. I think Mankell erred in setting most of the scene outside Sweden. Kurt is still the sloppy detective, constantly on the lookout for coffee and sandwiches and scared of his own tail. Some things are laughable such as when Kurt, in Riga, so concerned that he is being watched and followed wherever he goes, attempts to give any potential tail the slip by running, as fast as he can at that, for three whole blocks before turning a corner and proceeding at a normal pace. Now, in a large city, what is one of the best ways to attract attention to yourself? Yes, by running fast. He is truly pathetic but that is part of his charm, as when he falls in love almost at first sight with a particular character in Dogs. I also felt the ending, particularly the tossing back and forth as to whodunnit, was cheap. So what was good about it? Somehow I liked the fact that Kurt dedicated himself to helping people in another country that he barely knew at considerable danger to himself. It is easy to write such heroics, of course, but Kurt being such a chicken I was glad he volunteered.   Oh well, are there any truly good writers in the crime genre? Let me know if you know of any.
B001CDLATE|5.0|What can I say? What??? I just got back from seeing Inception for the 2nd time. I   think they are connected, Baraka, Avatar, and Inception. I think James Cameron and   Chris Nolan know Baraka well. I have not researched this, and if I am wrong, I  would still say this: Inception and Avatar and Baraka all share the same ethical  foundation. The same hope: Life. A great story allows each of us to illuminate   itself with our own individual light. It grows thereby to something beyond all   individualism.    I can't wait for Ron Fricke to make \\"Samsara\\", it is, to my knowledge, the next  great hope-of-a-movie on the horizon.    Oh, and with Baraka, you just gotta see the \\"Making Of\\" extra on the blu-ray. Its  mind-boggling what these film makers do. Unbelievable.    Is Baraka really that good? As good as Inception and Avatar? Without fiction, yes.

B002XUBDVK|4.0|This remastered edition corrects the image quality issues of the previous edition which had heavy handed use of DNR (digital noise reduction)often eliminating the grain and detail at the same time. Colors pop and detail is remarkably sharp throughout. Audio sounds terrific as well although the previous edition sounded quite good as well.

1400031524|5.0|Henning Mankell is the famous creator of Swedish detective Kurt Wallender. In \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" we see Wallender investigate a murder case which takes him to Riga, Latvia. (one of the three Baltic States) The novel is set in the last years of Latvia's status as a satellite of the moribund Soviet Union. The action begins when a raft washes up on the Swedish shore. The raft contains two bodies of well dressed men who have both been shot through the heart. We learn that they were involved in the lucrative drug trade from Eastern Europe into Sweden and Western countries.<br />  A detective arrives from Riga to participate in the investigation. Wallender travels to Riga where he distrusts the communist police department and is almost murdered. He falls in love with a beautiful Estonian widow but returns to Sweden alone at novel's end.Mankell's descriptions of drab and cold Riga living under the heel of Soviet domination is a fascinating snapshot of life in Eastern Europe.<br />  The novel is filled with a shoot out and plenty of cloak and dagger action in a well written, plotted and told police procedural. Mankell is good at making us care about the characters. Anytime you have an opportunity to read a Mankell novel do yourself a favor and curl up with a fine mystery novel!

0517548232|1.0|This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.
B003X27L9U|5.0|This is one of those books that stays with you for days.  The story is told in first person, by Jack.  Jack uses 5 year old sentence structure and comprehends life as a 5 year old boy would.  His character asks logical 5 year old questions that imitate 5 year old emotional complexity.  The author does an amazing job in creating Jack.    Jack knows only what exists in his 121 ft. life. Nothing else is real.  Although there is T.V., the images are not tangible, therefore, they don't exist outside the box.

For exsample on of the cards has a picture of a gas station and in the gas station there is a flag......you search the bricks to find out......there is no flag, the station is also colored mostly gray and red but the only grey bricks in the game are oddly shaped (some like a simi-circle others like an atatchment brick to a tube)overall, i give this game a 2out of 5 stars
B003W5C0VM|5.0|Folks, assuming the video transfer and audio mix are even close to what they were upon this film's initial release, anyone who purchases/views this is in for a treat. This is the Stones at their absolute zenith, with their greatest lead guitarist (Mick Taylor), performing the very best of their vast catalog (from their first post - \\"Exile\\" tour, yet still including much from \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed\\" & \\"Sticky Fingers\\") and Jagger's swagger & voice in peak form.

If this movie has gotten your interest in anyway, just get it. It's the kind of anime that transcends genre pigeonholing and also cultural barriers. I cry every time I watch it. An unforgettable movie!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been using this video for the past 30 days. I have done all three workouts. I have to say these short workouts are more of a workout than any of my 60 minute workouts I used in the past! I noticed muscle developing very quickly after I started this. I didn't lose any weight, and I didn't lose any inches around my waist or hips, which is disappointing, because I am dieting as well. However, my energy levels improve, my legs and arms are losing inches and looking leaner and more defined and I am going to hope that the rest catches up. Some reviews talked about the annoying music. Honestly, I paid no attention to the music.<br /><br />I recently got the Burn Fat Boost Metabolism DVD which is a longer workout by Jillian- many of the exercises are the same. However, what my complaint is that though the exercises are the same, she has a few she refers to by different names, so it is kind of annoying to remember what she means when she says mobiles (oblique twists in 30 day shred).<br /><br />What I love most is the way Jillian can encourage people to finish the workout. It's not loving and nurturing, it's pushing you to keep going because that's why you buy this DVD. I have finally really gotten into the routine of exercising every day, and I plan to stick it out and see where it takes me.  I guess I can thank Jillian for that attitude because normally I would get discouraged and quit working out. Not this time!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I was prompted to write a review based on some of the negative reviews.  People tend to say there aren't a lot of good songs on this album, or that it is too slow moving.<br /><br />In my opinion, this album is chock full of great songs!  Yes it is a double album, but every other song is an atmospheric musical interlude, so instead of two CDs full of non-step metal, you're really getting about one long album's worth of songs connected and filled out with the interludes.  The songs themselves are also layered with tons of synths, background vocals, keyboards, etc.  Between the interludes, all the layering, and the pure length of this album, most people aren't going to \\"get it\\" until they've listened to it more than a few times.<br /><br />This album is a \\"grower\\"; each time I listen to it, I like it more, and find something new in the music to appreciate.  It may not be the most intense, pure heavy metal release that Priest has put out, but it is probably their greatest accomplishment and most interesting release.  It's not for the casual fan or those whose favorite Priest songs are \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\", but if you appreciate epic, atmospheric rock and metal, Nostradamus is a joy.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|This is a well made war film about the experiences of Algerian volunteers for Frances cause in WW2. The combat scenes are very good! There are lots of extras and the battles are well done - they do not look cheap. Or sanitized, some parts are quite graphic indeed (rigor mortis shown for instance). The opening fight for an Italian mountain is quite eye opening in terms of the difficulties in attacking entrenched positions on a steep, rocky mountainside. There aren't many places to hide! The Germans (regular infantry only as far as I could tell) pound away with mortars and MGs and to my eye looked the business. I'm no expert but they looked pretty authentic and certainly, given the focus is on the Algerians, were presented as professional and deadly. Certainly, they clearly inflict many casualties. Following Italy, the unit (7th Algerian) is sent to France, is on the line in the Vosges, with the final battle in Alsace.    There are several key themes. A central one is the patriotism of so many of the North African soldiers. They refer to France as the mother country. They sing French songs and they take enormous pride in their role as liberators. This is despite a lot of discrimination. The French army is shown as being generally indifferent to them, constantly favouring French troops in terms of leave and promotions. There is also lots of petty discrimination, like ignoring mail needs and this is shown as being ever so destructive in its own right. Thus it was enthralling to see the reception the men got from local French civilians, who thanked them so wholeheartedly. I really enjoyed these scenes and it made some of the racism just that more painful. There are also a few scenes which deal with their religion.    The final battle, in an Alsace village, is very powerful indeed. The combat scenes have a very authentic look to them - particularly the moment of being shot, if that makes any sense? No Hollywood throwing arms in the air, men drop like stones, it is chilling stuff. Given that the viewer now knows the characters, there is some wrenching stuff. I felt this fight was extremely well done. It is one of the most effective 'house to house' combat depictions I have ever seen.    The film is in French, with English subtitles. I had no problem with this and I strongly recommend it as an insight into a little known aspect of the war but in particular for its compelling depictions of combat.

B003XU02QG|4.0|This is a story set in the time of Roman Britain. It begins with the `myth' of the 9th Legion, which might have been destroyed in battle with the wild Picts of Scotland. The bulk of the story though is concerned with the flight of a small group of survivors and the merciless pursuit of their fierce and vengeful enemies.     Frankly I struggle to understand the low profile of this film and the lukewarm reports. In my opinion it is a perfectly reasonable movie with some exceptional aspects. These include the stunning scenery which really conveys the bracing cold and desolation but also beauty of the far-North. It looks like an ancient land, all rugged and wild and is almost worth the price of admission alone. The Picts are hard as glacial ice, tough and violent and look very impressive too.     With the story itself I had a few quibbles but it was serviceable. The action scenes were generally good, even tense in places but I was annoyed with some battle scenes which featured the modern technique of very frequent and too fast cut-a-ways, making it hard to know exactly what was happening. A note here, it is very bloody - there are flying limbs, very crushed body bits and blood splattering everywhere. This is however what the weapons of the time did. Both sides are shown as the hard cases they were too. The Picts are savage but the Romans were hardly the Red Cross. The characters are adequate, with the Pict King and the deadly female tracker being quite impressive. I enjoyed watching the Roman legion on the match and in battle, though its camp routine seemed different to the acknowledged practice. But the uniforms and armour looked pretty good to a layman like me. There was also some funny soldier by-play to provide some chuckles.    So, it's well filmed, showing the era about as authentically as you can get. The story itself is ok. There are some good twists and at times, some real tension! In all I found it to be very entertaining. It is a muscular film that deserves an audience. If you have interests in ancient warfare, you should find this quite rewarding.
0375760024|5.0|It's easy to see why Doyle's stories have stayed so popular for over 100 years.  I was never a big mystery buff, but from the very first sentence of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia,\\" I was hooked.  Each story is the perfect length to read in one sitting, and Sherlock's reasoning and observation abilities never fail to entertain.  He's a classic literary character that everyone should read about, and this collection is a great place to start.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|As is widely known, this version of the tale is a prequel of sorts. It's only generally tied to the 'history' and the established myth but I found this refreshing. Crowe is quite good in his 'tough guy' sort of way and fine too in the romantic aspects. The action is very good. I really liked the opening seige in France and while the final beach battle is good too, I couldn't help thinking it looked a bit like Saving Private Ryan. The Liberty speech reminded me of several other similar efforts and the lost boys of Sherwood Forrest had a distinct Peter Pan (with a Wendy) look too. I found the representations of both Kings Richard and John interesting, as they went against type -to a degree. Indeed, King John was a lot of fun. There were many faces to spot (I don't think its giving anything away to say that Max Von Sydow accepts that any role he takes involves him dying.), including some surprises and people going against type. It's overall a very handsome film, with some sceens being quite spectactular. I had a lot of fun watching it. If you don't see it expecting it to be like Errol Flynn's version, you should enjoy it too.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Iron Man 2 is very entertaining, whether its the hilarious badass comedy or the superhero antics, it does not disappoint. The movie is a great film to watch with a friend, spouse, or family. It entertains almost anyone and is well worth watching. Getting a blu-ray version is the way to go.
030726999X|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic! The plot draws you in, and once you start reading, there's no putting this book down. The entire trilogy spins a complex plot that has so many surprising twists that all come together in the end. You should definitely buy it!
B001C3KCSY|2.0|Is mainstream music so terrible that an album that has only 2 good songs is praised by millions and even awarded a grammy? WTF. I went and bought this album yesterday after hearing so many good things about it. The only good songs on this album are \\"Closer\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\". The rest of the songs are filler tracks. There are tons of other bands out there that put out albums where EVERY song is good. This is just plain and boring. Nothing stands out except for a few melody lines here and there that last 5 seconds. This is the type of music you'd hear at grocery stores, movie theatres, and places like that. There's nothing catchy about this music. I want my 15 dollars back. Next time I actually buy a cd I'll stick to the lesser known bands that actually write cool material that turns heads.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|It took a serious listening to this album to begin to appreciate.  I had a bit of insomnia one night in the<br />northern most city in America (the sun just started going down a week ago) and listened to it twice and<br />came away spellbound.  It works as a whole album.  I agree with the other reviews who say that a number<br />of songs 'don't work' and that others really do work.  The five songs that I think are excellent here support<br />the rest when you listen to it as an album.  I've noticed that the way ipods have changed how I listen to music<br />and I often fail to listen to albums as whole products.  This happened accidentally and am pleased that<br />I can listen to the whole thing without complaint (I confess to skipping the opener - and am glad I got<br />this from Apple's music site for the bonus track).
1596062754|2.0|This book has been sitting on my shelf for a while (sometimes I buy so many books they pile up!) and thought it would be fun to get back into the Scalzi series. What a waste! Aliens who have given names and surnames, \\"werewolves\\" who might be interesting but got lost halfway through the book, and, as others have noted, a \\"deus ex machina\\" ending.     Stick with the first two, they had interesting premises and novel ideas. This one reads like he had to finish out a contract.

B00004VYMF|1.0|Okay so I made the mistake of odering this product without knowing what region 2 meant. That means it can only be played with a certain dvd player made in some different countries that are not Canada or the US. So don't make the stupid mistake I did. Unless you live in Japan or any other country that is compatable with region 2.
0618918248|5.0|Thank you Richard Dawkins.  This book provides a major source of information and rationality for the open minded reader.  Dawkins begins by describing the abrahamic religions and religion in general, discussing what they mean and how they are used.  Then he systematically identifies the logical and practical fallicies that come from religion.  This book is very thorough and provides a solid defence to science, logic, reason, and rationality.  By pulling no punches, Dawkins accompishes the task of removing religion from the its ridiculous pedestal of \\"untouchable\\" by taboo.  Most important,  Atheists can now provide feel confident in standing up for reason and rejecting supernatural claims that were formed during periods of time where people of our species believed the sun revolved around the earth.  I highly reccomend this book.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is one movie I will never get tired of... a masterpiece! The discs are in great condition and I have had no problems with it at all. For all of those Andrew Lloyd Webber fans this is something that you must have.
1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins does a fantastic job at highlighting the major evidence for evolution and explaining it in a way that allows for even the most unscientific minds to understand evolution.  This great read is an excellent source for introducing people to evolution, while also an equally excellent read for those who already work in evolutionary biology.  For those of you who find themselves constantly forced to argue against the \\"history deniers\\", aka creationists who deny evolution and claim the earth is less than 10,000 years old, this book is a great source material for presenting the arguements to creationists.  I really enjoyed this book and reccomend it to everyone.
0061673730|3.0|I've been a bit disappointed in this book, given the number of stellar recommendations I've heard.  My main disappointment is in the careless logic that's presented--unverifiable generalizations that the author expects you to accept as true, even without support.  And if you don't accept them as true, then the following generalizations are meaningless.  (As a quick example, opening to a random page:  \\"You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.\\"  This is an absolute statement that simply cannot be proved, yet he expects you to accept it and builds further arguments upon it.)  He's built a house of cards out of cards that are ripped or torn, and if you examine one card too closely, the whole house falls down.    I'm also extremely put off by the way the main character treats his son in the book.  He's somewhat kind to him, but he refuses to communicate with him on a serious level and very often cuts him off because he's \\"too tired\\" to talk, and then wonders and whines about his \\"lack of connection\\" with his son.  Please. . . .    All in all, an interesting book, but far too long and very weak on logic.  If I were to use it in a classroom, I'd use it to demonstrate how easy it is to tear apart a supposedly logical argument that's built on sand, not stone.
0143118420|1.0|Man, my hat is off to those reviewers who finished the book because I just didn't have it in me to stick with it.  The heroine was so uninteresting and so self-important.  She lost me at \\"bathroom floor\\".  If you must read it, get it from the library.
0061205699|3.0|I enjoyed reading this classic story and found strong moral undertones present.  I enjoyed the ideas presented by the characters as well.  However, I also thought Lee droned on about seemingly trivial matters in certain cases.  It was almost like reading an aside at times.  After getting accustomed to her style, I trained myself to skim these sections that were not central to the plot.
B001N26GFM|3.0|The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is yet another take on the horrors of the holocaust. So many horrors, I'd venture to say, that a hundred more books and movies could be made about it. Although I was born in America and was never  personally touched by the Holocaust, in a way I actually was. As a child I saw the horrific photos of piles of emaciated bodies lying in heaps and it colored my world. I think at that moment I knew how the world was and I became an Athiest on the spot and gratefully stayed one. I never want to believe in a God that would or could let that happen for any reason. It still bothers me when people (usually Christians or other religious people} think that God personally caters to them when there are people laying in the dirt somewhere starving to death. Same with the Holocaust. Why would God do this or that, but let the Holocaust happen? The ability to live your life with blinders on must be nice, but that is what happened on a monumental scale in Germany. And this film, as flawed as it is, is yet another chilling example of what happens when you do. The movie is well made. Great music, acting, attention to detail, except for one very glaring fact. Yes, it was set in Germany, but everyone has a distinct English accent. Even the strawberry blond evil Nazi youth has a distinct English accent, as do the Jews in the concentration camp. There isn't a German accent to be found anywhere. Maybe someone on the movie set had one, but no one in the movie does, which I think has a detrimental effect on the whole thing. I couldn't help but think about England during this period. They were being terrorized by Hitler too, yet the movie has the good guys and the bad guys all speaking with English accents. It was hard to get past and a little unsettling. English accents are, for lack of a better word, usually pretty. The actors accents gave the whole movie a genteel feel, which a Holocaust movie should never have. Funny no one who has reviewed this film mentioned the English accents because I kept waiting for the Nazis to have a tea party. It drained the movie of true menace and made it seem unrealistic. If it weren't for the performances of the two boys and the mother, the movie really could have sunk in my opinion... that is until the ending, which is absolutely chilling. I was stunned and had to recover from it. But afterwards it made me realize how badly I wanted what preceded it, to have even half the impact the ending does. It was so good, but it could have been nearly perfect with a little tweeking.he English accents because I kept waiting for the Nazis to have a tea party.

1423113381|1.0|The biggest difference between the Percy Jackson book series and this book is that Egyptian gods actually possess Carter and Sadie in The Red Pyramid.  I would not want any child to be influenced by the thought of \\"possession,\\" which dominates the entire book.  I will not allow my children to read the book now that I have previewed it.  This book is confusing, muddled, and rambles from one event to another -- and is way too long.  Sadie and Carter 'sound' much older than indicated.  I don't know of kids at their age who can think and make decisions in the same manner as these two children.  I also do not recommend the book as leisure reading for adults.  Stay away from this one -- it's not even wholesome reading.
0399156690|5.0|This is one of Nora Roberts' better stand-alone (not part of a series) books in recent years.  She has a fantastic sense of humor and weaves that into a wonderful romance/mystery.  Both of her main characters are strong but not annoying or perfect.  Even the dogs seem real!  I also learned some things about canine rescue from this book.  It is a great summer read!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have bought both the DVd and CD of \\"Songs fo the heart\\" and can´t get enough of them. Love every single song on it, the vocals, the insturmentals, the arrangements, everything. Certainly recommend it to those who live the Celtic Woman musical style. Would really love to be able to see them perform live, but they don´t come to this far side of the world (Uruguay, South America)!!
B003EPPEP4|1.0|I suspect Nikki got a CD released because of her looks, not her singing. The few two cuts I heard on NPR are of her oversinging the tunes, trying to sound \\"black\\" and just being irritating. Not sure why anyone would buy a whole CD of this.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I love movies set in this time period and the way the actors talk to one another.  The story of predjudice towards different classes of people is changed when to people fall in love with each other, but it takes awhile for the two main actors to find each other.  This is what is appealing to me. Kira and her \\"Mr. Dorcy\\" are two really fine actors and do a superb job in this movie.  I'm in my early 50's and loved it, but my teenage daughters thought it was on the boring side.  Hope this helps you decide to buy the movie.
B0035G04TI|3.0|My friend recommends that I read this book.  While I am not a Christian, I am really into personal development and self-growth work.  I find this book helpful in that it focuses in making the distinction between \\"fall in love\\" and being emotionally in love. I can see learning ways that will be supportive of your significant other's emotional need will definitely help strengthens the relationship and enhances the happiness for both.  I'm happy to discover this new conversation I can have with my fiancé in discovering each other's primary love language and making sure we are all taking our parts in help meeting each other's emotional needs.     The only thing is the book would even be better for all cultures and religions if the author would just let go of his needs of constant referring to his religious believe in the book.  I considered what the book is pointing out human nature and not religious in nature. Frequent references to his religious belief serve more as a distraction to me than supporting me in getting deeper into this conversation. Also, the section that talks about loving someone who doesn't love you, leave a big question mark in my head. The author seems to fail to acknowledge the possibility that sometimes being together IS a mistake (Our judgment and decisions are never perfect and mistakes do happen). More importantly, it fails to deal with hard case where people attempt to hang on to a really bad relationship not because they still love the other, but there are self-worthy and self-sabotaging issues involved.  The advice on this book for these cases can actually be misleading and give people an excuse to not look deeper within them.    So, overall, I would give a cautious thumb up for this book.
B000002C2E|5.0|Album is now in its third rotation in the player in my truck. The way it sounds, it'll go for at least two more before I decide to move on to something else. Won't analyze song-by-song. Others have done that enough. If you like the music of Bob Dylan, this album's a no-brainer. Click buy if you've read this far. Enjoy!
0817439390|5.0|Awhile back, while reading all the positive reviews of earlier versions of this book, I saw that a new version was soon to be released, and I decided to wait for it.  The book was received from Amazon yesterday on the release date!     After quickly leafing through and looking at all the great photos, I decided to start reading. A short while into the book, it occurred to me that \\"this is one of my favorite books\\"!  And I was only on page 16!      I became something of a photo hobbyist many years ago with a film slr and got back into it a few months ago by buying a decent digital slr. A glance at the table of contents shows that the book covers the basics of exposure: aperture, shutter speed, iso, white balance, lighting, filters. So I'm reviewing the basics, but I think Mr. Peterson's insights would also be valuable to more advanced photographers.      I enjoy looking at the photos and trying to guess what the camera settings were.  Mr. Peterson chose some gorgeous photos--by themselves they would be more than worth the price of the book--as examples of exposure principles.     I'm now on page 20, reading some great insights on ISO.  Understanding Exposure, 3rd edition is a six-star book!  If, when I finish reading it, I decide to subtract stars, I'll let you know. But I'd be very surprised! I'm looking forward to the read and to improving my creative skills.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I bought a 3-pack of these for 60 dollars to fill out my personal PA  needs and give my 30 year old SM-57 a rest.  These are now what we use up front for all the vocals in my band...they are awesome!!!!  As close to a Shure SM 58 in every respect except price!!!!  Great response,clarity and presence!!  They also seem to be as rugged as any mic needs to be.  I could not be happier with the value of this mic,and highly recommend it to anyone that needs a SM 58,but doesnt want to part with that kind of money!!
0060254920|5.0|I purchased this book as it was considered a classic. My kids (boy/girl/3/6) , however, have never been that interested in it. They LOVE stories, but this one we ended up giving away as it was collecting dust on the shelf.

Flipping through it after it arrived, I've already learned half a dozen new things about cooking--and I've been cooking geek for 30 years.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written--quite accessible to the average geek with some cooking experience and a healthy curiosity. The layout and design are fantastic as well--it's a pleasure to hold and read.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to this becoming my favorite cook book.
030745455X|5.0|I am not a fiction reader but enjoyed the first book of this series so much I thought I'd give The Girl Who Played With Fire a chance.  Wow ! I thought it was even better than the first book.  In fact I couldn't put it down !  Now I understand what all the fuss is about.  Recently I watched the first movie ( Dragon Tattoo) and it also confirmed what a great story teller Steig Lasson is !  Such a shame he never lived to see his series become so widely read.
0156421178|5.0|As a studious of the XX century world story, I had appreciated a lot this book, as an instrument to deepen and to understand the events during the Spain war in 1936- 1937, when the communists, belonging to the international brigade sent by Stalin and coordinated by Togliatti, exterminated the spanish anarchists.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a very well researched and engaging book.  It is thought provoking,tragic and triumphant at the same time.  This is a must read for all biomedical researchers, with the basic question of 'what price for the good of man' still left unanswered.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|This is by far my favorite show released by Bright Midnight!  By 1970, the Doors were forced to toe the line after Miami and most of the shows were somewhat sedated compared the to '68 tour.  The Boston and Felt Forum shows are definitely the most exciting and energetic shows from 1970.  Yes, Morrison is blasted during both sets but in good spirits - rapping with the audience and playfully telling one of the girls to shut up during at the start of Mystery Train.  The highlight for me is the song they play right before the power is cut.  The band is playing the music to Maggie McGill but Morrison sings the lyrics to \\"Been Down So Long\\" and also adds some improvised lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, I think even casual Doors fans will like this show.  The other Bright Midnight releases are great quality but lack the excitement of Live at Boston Arena (now Northeastern U. Mathews Arena).  Also pick up the Felt Forum box set.  The last show from 1/18/1970 is amazing.
0739366408|5.0|Brooks, author of \\"The Zombie survival guide\\" (and son of director Mel Brooks), has created a book similar to Studs Terkel's \\"The good war\\"--only this one is a tale of the fictional war between the zombies and humans.  The narrator travels the world to interview people about their memories of the war, which began as a few isolated zombie 'incidents' in China, and spread quickly, causing mass relocation, death, and destruction.  Traditional military strategies are useless:  \\"What if the enemy can't be shocked and awed?  Not just won't but biologically can't?\\"    Fans of George Romero's zombie movies will enjoy this.  The audiobook features many readers, which adds to the documentary feel.  Among the recognizable voices are Alan Alda, Carl Reiner, Mark Hamill, and more.
B001IF252M|3.0|Works fine, looks just like shown except it does NOT have that writing on the cable which i prefer.  For the price it is a really good product,   So Far SO gOOD    Scratch all that   it broke only a few weeks after  purchase. DO your selves a favor and buy the same cable from APPLE.   spend the extra money, for better quality ! it will be worth in the long run
B00005JPMZ|5.0|My son loves this movie.  He was so excited to get it.  We watch it all the time.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  When I read Pride and Prejudice (at least once a year) it takes me to a time that I wish I could visit.  The rich characters seem like true friends, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to spend an evening with The Darcy's.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I am usually hypercritical of the formula romantic comedies, action films, etc. that come out of the US movie industry, specifically Hollywood and NY, but this one, despite a slow start and awkward ending was a total surprise. Just thinking about the movie the day after provokes a chuckle so there's a little something special embedded in this movie - kudos to the KA film posse.     Let's cut it short - five big ones for this little creative and surprising gem.     Caveats to the viewers and to Chloe Grace (Mindy). First to the viewing audience as you already know from other sources there's a bit of profanity and blood - don't worry it's so outrageous it's more funny than psychologically harmful. Second to Chloe Grace,  take everything you said and did as outrageous satire and be sure to hold up as some of your role models truly great athletes who are always in control of themselves. Despite the battles they encounter they don't need the profanities, the fights - they handle it all with artistic intelligence and skill.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Lost was a wonderful television program, filled with all sorts of mind twisting ideas, mysteries and conundrums. The storytelling was remarkable and first rate...for five years. Season six is beyond poor. I can't decide whether the writers lost their nerve or whether they ever had any intention of resolving the myriad of plotlines and story points in the first place. And I don't care.<br /><br />Imagine a long joke, with an elaborate set up...and no punchline. Essentially, a colossal waste of time.<br /><br />While I loved the series up until Season 6, and remind myself that, often, 'It's the journey, not the destination'- but who expected at the end of the 'journey', to be thrown off a cliff?  The 'extras' they will include on the DVDs are meaningless. They've proved how little they respect their audience. Who'd pay for more of that??<br /><br />At one time, I imagined watching the show again and again...but I'll sell my copies of seasons 1-5 on eBay. Cheap.
B0016MJ6T2|4.0|This movie is an under rated gem.  I loved the campy performances of Culkin & Green, and the two young stars have a great chemistry together. Marilyn Manson's turn also more than capable, and any film featuring the delightfully creepy Diana Scarwid always gets my vote. Worth watching for costumes an makeup alone.<br /><br />I re-watched the original \\"Home Alone\\" recently, so when I saw this in a discount bin I picked it up out of curiosity, and was very glad I did. I can understand all the reasons why MC is virtually retired from film, but this film shows what a versatile actor he is, and how much potential is undoubtedly still there. His character is as different to Kevin as it is possible to imagine, playing a narcissistic psychpath, basically. On the strength of this, I would definately check out any other film featuring an adult Culkin.<br /><br />If you enjoyed such films as Hedwig or Velvet Goldmine, [although this one is somewhat darker] or harbour a morbid \\"where are they now?\\" interest in former child stars, you'd probably like this. IMDB rating is much lower than the film deserves, judging by the DB I think amny viewers were expecting something quite different. My only criticism is that for some inexplicable reason, it steps very discreetly around any overt gay references, despite the fact the two main characters clearly are, yet revels in frequent and explicit drug use.<br /><br />Well worth a look.
0393312836|4.0|A number of groups have put together their list of the '100 Greatest books', and I have been slowing reading through some of their choices. 'A Clockwork Orange' appears on a number of the lists. There have been times when I read a classic novel, and it just doesn't connect with me. It is a great pleasure when a classic book turns out to be...just that a classic.    'A Clockwork Orange' is the story of Alex, a young hooligan who spends most of his evenings/nights reaking havok. Alex and his 'droogs' beat people, fight rival gangs, steal, rape, and murder. We see some tension and a budding power struggle in Alex's gang. This leads to Alex's eventual capture and imprisonment. The state has a new treatment to reform the ultra-violent inmates. Will this change lead Alex down the right path?    This novel is a great look at loosing ones freedom. Whether from the gangs who inflict violence on the innocent, or from the prisoner who looses the ability to choose. We watch Alex move from a gang leader, to a prisoner, to a test subject, to a government pawn, to a political pawn, and back to violence. While this book is nearing 50 years old, it still sends a strong message. It a very enjoyable read!
B000KIPT30|5.0|I hooked this up to the output of my Mackie mixing desk. I have my powered monitors (via a Y cable) on one output and my headphones on another.    I can now play my guitar, write, record, etc through the speakers or the headphones and very quickly switch between them without messing about with cables and whatnot.     Because my headphones are closed (DJ type) they cut out a lot of background noise and I previously found myself wondering \\"are the speakers off?\\". It was particularly awkward in that the power switches for my speakers is on the back. Not handy!    Now I've installed this headphone amp it's definitely become an integral part of my setup, and definitely worth the money. Now I can actually get on with the music :-)    Another excellent Behringer purchase. Recommended without hesitation.
1582403589|5.0|Okay, so I've never read a comic book or graphic novel in my life. It just didn't seem like my type of thing and I've always thought that I would never get into reading something like that. But I figured since the TV show is coming out soon, I love zombies/horror/apocalyptic books and movies, what better way to branch out of my reading comfort than to about things I usually enjoy. And I must say that it was far from a mistake because I loved the first volume of The Walking Dead.<br /><br />Zombie fan that I am, I had assumed that the only thing I would like about The Walking Dead would be, you know, the zombies. However, while I liked the zombies, I was completely enthralled by the characters and the whole dire situation that they were in. I was also very into the drama of their lives: the love triangles, the spats between the non-judgmental with the actual judgemental, etc., etc. The way humanity was portrayed just seemed very real to me. In times of crisis, people's true colors come out whether those colors happen to be pleasant or not (and most times they aren't pleasant). There was no sugar-coating of the human spirit. It was what it was.<br /><br />Like I've mentioned before, I've never read a comic book before so I'm not sure what's considered to be \\"good\\" comic book art and \\"bad\\" comic book art. The illustrations seemed pretty well done to me (Sure, I confused Rick and Shane a couple of times until I remembered \\"Okay, Shane is the bulky one with the scowl permanently attached to his face and Rick is the string bean one with the heroic facial expressions\\"). The zombies seemed zombie like and brutal (of course not as they look on TV or movies but still pretty damn good).<br /><br />It did take me a few pages to follow who was saying what (the bubbles got a bit confusing for a minute) and to get used to the comic book format in general. But it wasn't too bad for a complete and total newbie like me. And I did laugh when the zombies \\"Ugh\\"-ed and \\"Glak\\"-ed since apparently that's all the zombie vocabulary requires; in fact it's practically a staple.<br /><br />So, I did love The Walking Dead. It was brutal and gory but most importantly it had heart. It's about a man trying to protect his family. That was heartwarming. In the interest of full disclosure, I am going to say that this comic book did make me cry, not only once, but twice. This was just very entertaining and really great.

It was brutal and gory but most importantly it had heart. It's about a man trying to protect his family. That was heartwarming. In the interest of full disclosure, I am going to say that this comic book did make me cry, not only once, but twice. This was just very entertaining and really great.

0385341008|4.0|Despite its numerous problems, I found this book to be an entertaining and enjoyable read.  In 1946, the writer Juliet Ashton begins a correspondence with the quirky inhabitants of Guernsey Island. As the letters progress the various characters relate their stories of life under Nazi occupation and the founding of the eponymous literary society.<br /><br />This seems tailor-made for a screenplay (which in all honesty will probably be better than the book). Sure; the characters are shallow stereotypes, they all have the same voice, suspension of disbelief is pushed past the breaking point, and the plot is painfully predictable - but it is FICTION for goodness sake.
B002N8A14M|4.0|The hole on the bottom that allows room for the earphone jack is TOO SMALL to fit in all the way. I cannot leave the iPod inside the case while using car speakers because the mp3 jack isn't secured all the way in. This leaves only two of four speakers working.    You'll need to watch out for certain aftermarket earphones. If the mp3 jack is too big, it will not fight through the case. The standard iPod earphones themselves do not plug in all the way, but the sound is still perfect; it might just fall out occasionally if you're exercising or hopping around a lot.    Also, the clip makes it so the iPod is facing downward. If you have the iPod clipped onto your belt, you'll be looking at it backwards.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|This is a spy movie for adults, and one of the best I ever saw. That being said, this is a mixed review, because while I would not have missed seeing this movie once, I would not want to own it. The movie is a masterpiece of intrigue and atmosphere.  It lacks the cheap attention getters of wild car chases,  excessive foul language, needless bloody gore, and over blown, explicit sex scenes that have nothing to do with the story, for which I am very grateful. I won't deal with the details of the plot, as other reviewers have gone into it, and both the positive and negative reviews describe the story very well.  The story moves our hero, the ghostwriter, through an entire series of events, as he starts out investigating the unexpected death of the writer who had the job before him.  He discovers a huge conpiracy involving the CIA, British politics, CIA sleeper agents, America placing British leaders in their postions of power, and making sure that anyone who gets in the way meets a bad end.  (Personally, I think that if the CIA was really this good at their jobs, we would not be in the world state that we are in right now.)  The plot is interesting and involving, and draws the watcher into it, along with the hero.  You have the feeling that this could really happen to any ordinary person, to you, or someone you know.  The ghostwriter finds himself swept up into events far too large for him to deal with, leaving him with no one he can trust or turn to.  What is disturbing is that he is the only character in the story with good intentions.  Everybody else either has their own agenda or doesn't give a damn. Unfortunately the ghostwriter tries his best to do the right thing, and his good intentions get him killed in the end. That's a little too close to reality for my comfort.  Although I did not really like the ending, it fit the flow of the story and gave added dramatic impact to the story.  VERY well worth watching, but it would not be a favorite that I would watch often.

B003X73QA8|5.0|(After listening to this album more and more I have to amend my first review and bump it from 4 to 5 stars. This Album is amazing and one of the best I have heard in a long time. Though I will keep my original review, for honesty's sake, my opinion of this album has obviously grown tremendously.)<br />\\"Suburbs\\" is not the same Arcade Fire we have heard in the previous two albums. But just because it's different does not mean it's bad. I guess most critics would consider this a \\"more mature\\" album than Funeral and Neon Bible. The lyrics are thoughtful and thought provoking and the melodies are moving. No, it does not seem to have the passion and energy of AF's first albums, but each album is a progression into who the band is becoming. I was disappointed after the first couple listens, but around the third and fourth runs through I have accepted that this album does not have a \\"Wake Up\\" or a \\"Keep the Car Running\\" I love to blast through my car windows. But it does have the airy and surprisingly bright (considering the lyrics) \\"City With No Children\\" and the eerie and sorrowful \\"Half Light II.\\" I don't think many people want the youthful energy and engaging sound they fall in love with to change as bands evolve musically, but that is just the nature of music (unless, of course, you listen to Andrew W. K.). So if you find yourself bored the first couple times through, give it a chance to grow on you. Hopefully you will find it just as satisfying even if it's not as rockin'.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|I watched this because seeing Pagey in this kind of detail is rare.  One has to put up with Jack White (as white as they come, good name) and Dull Edge (incongruous seeing him on stage--or the same planet--with Jimmy Page) but overall is is worth it. I did have to go to \\"mute\\" on several occasions, when I could not stand it.

145283668X|5.0|Like most who pick up this book today, I was familiar with the feature character(s) in this story, but I was a bit surprised by the brevity and the suspenseful nature of the writing.  I can only imagine reading this book when it was first written, before the idea of a split personality had really been explored in literature.  I would have been on the edge of my seat.  Even now, though I knew the answer to the riddle as I read, I was close to the edge of my seat.  Stevenson's writing style and vocabulary are refreshing as he moves the story along at just the right pace.  A necessary addition to every classic literature repertoire.
034544678X|5.0|The first time I picked up this book, I was looking for some tips on dog training.  Yes, I had read the title and figured this wasn't a training book, but I was desparate for a training book with meat in it.  I was disappointed.  A year later I find that I have not only read the book twice, but have passed it on to others.  Not only is it insightful but extremely well written.  It strikes a balance between academic underpinnings, experiencal antedote, and story telling.  Most of the negative reviews reflect my initial reaction: It's not a training manual but it wasn't advertised as such.  This was a breakthrough book times have advanced but it still is worth the effort to read for those who started by reading the title.
0061205699|5.0|Finally, a classic that I enjoyed! Ms. Lee's voice resonates with truth and character.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|The virtuous are not rewarded and the evil are not punished.  Trust leads to betrayal sorrow more often than not.  These books are the antidote for the sunshine and lollipops you'll find in more typical fantasy fiction.  Even so, the plots are so intricate and engrossing, you will not be able to put these down until you have read all of them.  I'm only two books into the series and I know there will be a lot of sleepless nights reading to find out how this all turns out.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|The film \\"Surrogates\\" when first released in the cinema escaped my attention, and I only really watched it by both coincidence and my own laziness. Picture the scene, you have the movie channel on, it's late, you're tired and you can't find the remote. Rather than getting up to look for it I thought to myself \\"f*** it, I'll just watch what's on next\\"; what was on next was Surrogates. Suddenly very vague memories of the times seeing the trailer and thinking to myself \\"hmm, I should see that\\" came flushing back and I simply decided to keep watching. Not a particularly engaging or important film, what really captivated me was that this film said a hell of a lot more than I imagined it would about the society that we live in and the way it's going.<br /><br />Set sometime in the future, humans have decided to lie back and live out their lives as remotely controlled androids built to their specifications. Almost the entire human race decides to live out their lives in these robotic bodies, but a few small reservations of humanity, who choose not to live as robots still exist and, lead by a man known as The Prophet (Ving Rhames), seek to end this abomination. A string of mysterious murders take place where the android is destroyed using a special weapon, which at the same time kills its controller. Called in to investigate these crimes are Agents Greer (Bruce Willis) & Peters (Radha Mitchell).<br /><br />Agent Greer has a more personal presence on the screen (as he is the star, durr) and it deals with the more personal impacts of living your life in the body of a robot. Agent Greer struggles to reconcile his differences with his wife over the failing relationship with his wife and lack of any human contact between them, as they have only come to communicate via their androids, motivated by the death of their son. The investigation into the cause of the murders comes with a lot of surprises both fairly humorous and genuinely surprising.<br /><br />The message of the movie was the most interesting element of the whole thing. Sure, there were some great action scenes and Bruce Willis' presence was what really secured this movie's credibility, but it said so much about the way in which society seems to be going. We've become an internet obsessed society, a medium which can allow us to become whoever we want and with games such as \\"Second Life\\" and \\"World of Warcraft\\" having literally millions of users, they allow for a welcome escapism from the horror or pain of real life. Personally, I would say it's only a matter of something like 100 years at the most and we will be close to the society depicted in this movie.<br /><br />Starring one of actions biggest legends, the script isn't great, but you can't go wrong with some excellent action and a truly intriguing concept. Buy it, you'll enjoy it. I promise.element of the whole thing.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is by far the king of the Spiel des Jahres winners.  Every game can be different, as the \\"board\\" is made up of individual hexagonal pieces that you can place randomly.  There are several strategies to win, and often your strategy can change one or more times during a single game based on how you are doing and how your opponents are doing.  It really makes you think on your toes.  Resource constraints, trading with your opponents, and deciding on the various avenues of growth all come into play to make this an engaging game.    The beauty of the game is how the person in the lead can change frequently during the game.  You have to be careful not to concentrate too much on one opponent while another sneaks up and wins.  And this isn't Monopoly -- in most games, most if not all players have a chance at winning during the endgame.    The game components are all of top-notch quality, with sturdy cardboard and wooden pieces.    I would also highly recommend the expansions.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|\\"Roll Away Your Stone\\" is breathtaking.  Other than that, most of the album's pretty good, and some of it is a bit on the boring side.  The lyrics especially tend to be less than stellar.  They really are pretty generic, though still better than most of the junk that's flooding the airwaves these days.  (BTW, in response to the reviewer who said they're a Christian rock band...I'm not really getting that vibe from these lyrics.  It's true that they do tackle a lot of spiritual type issues but they seem pretty harshly critical of the whole Christianity thing.)  But the music is seriously kickin, and these guys have an amazing sense of harmony and rhythmic drive.  I love listening to this album in the car.  Anyway, Mumford and Sons is clearly a band with major potential and I look forward to future releases.
B003LAH7MU|3.0|I think that I have all of Sting's albums except for his last couple (Sacred Love and If on a Winter's Night...), so I'm a decent fan of his. I don't have any of his B-sides or rarities, but I've enjoyed most of his catalog. I listened to this CD several times and it's enjoyable and of a high production quality. However, I actually didn't find it enough of a deviation from the original workings to warrant a purchase for a casual fan such as myself. In many cases, the orchestral sounds merely replace whatever the background riff was on a song. That's not to say that they don't do it well, but it just wasn't a complete reworking of some of the songs.<br /><br />It was nice that a couple of songs not found on common Sting studio releases, such as \\"Pirate's Bride\\" and \\"You Will Be My Ain True Love\\", were on here. I thought that \\"Englishman in New York\\" and \\"We Work the Black Seam\\" received the best treatment with Sting's voice even more to the front that on some of the original recordings. However, it seemed that there was some obligation to put the big hits on here and so \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\\" simply did not translate the way other choices did. \\"I Hung My Head\\" is a fantastic Sting song and perhaps if the two well-known hits were replaced with a couple of strong songs from his albums but were just a bit lesser-known, it would have seemed a more cohesive album.<br /><br />Peter Gabriel attempted something similar with his Scratch My Back album and really took songs in a new direction. Unfortunately, that album was sparse and dreary but the point is that if Sting had really tried just a few more drastic changes here and there and a couple of song replacements, this would be a higher-rated album in my book.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|It's hilarious reading the bad reviews about Pocahontas. They either complain that the movie is too mature (it tries too hard to be politically correct, and it is too blatant in its portrayal of violence and racism), or that it is too childish (making a mockery of actual history by portraying it in a cartoon-ish and simplistic manner). So, what is it?    The problem is that people already have too many opinions formed about it before they even watch it. People were already protesting 'Pocahontas' before it was even released way back in 1995! Why judge something before you have seen it? If you  watch it with an open mind, you will see that Pocahontas is a wonderful movie with a great message, and that the creators took a lot of care into trying to portray Indian culture in a respectful way. Great music, great animation, great story. Extremely underrated. And one of my favorites. (:
0439023483|5.0|To paraphrase T.S. Elliot:  Good writers borrow; great writers steal.    So what if the premise is largely taken from two of Stephen King's stories ('The Running Man' [good eye, Kevin], and 'The Long Walk', with Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery' thrown in for good measure)?  However, these ideas are STOLEN, not borrowed.  Collins does a nice job of making the outlandish premise her own by setting it in a (mostly) believable distopic future peopled by familiar archetypes (the noble lad, the wise man, the brute..).      But instead of a strong, macho warrior, she gives us Katniss, a girl on the cusp of womanhood who'd rather hunt squirrels than fawn over boys- even strong, able boys like Gale, her best friend.  Katniss anchors this story through her riveting first-person, present tense narrative describing her actions and her conflicting emotions as she navigates the terrors of the Hunger Games and the absurd world around her.        The 'bread and circuses' of the Hunger Games is designed to instill feelings of unmistakable servitude, fear, and awe into the hearts of the people within the 12 principalities that serve The Capitol.      I pause here to reflect on the haunting similarities of modern America compared with Panem (what's left of a post-apocalyptic North American supercountry).  During my lifetime, American teenagers could be randomly selected for war.  Many times, the rich could get out of service; it was the poor and often uneducated who bore the brunt of the fighting.  And what did they fight for?  If you buy into the mass media messages, it's always about Freedom, and Our Way of Life.  However, if you talk to veterans, almost to a man they will say they fought to stay alive and to keep their platoon members safe.  It was the love of their fellow countrymen that kept them alive.  So it is with Katniss and Peeta.    Collins world also echoes modern America's fascination for real-world playoff-type entertainment.  It's 'Big Brother' or 'Survivor' for lunatics.  Think about it:  a wealthy ruling class puts together a show of 'regular' people (dressed up and made up by professional image-makers) all pitted together to out-last one another.  The country is forced to watch.  Any sort of rebellion against the state is edited out of the show.  Everyone has a part to play.    Yet there is an undercurrent of rebellion throughout in Kat's actions and thoughts.  She wants to subvert the system...or at least to find her OWN system?  This theme is echoed in the symbolism of the mockingjays.  These birds, mutated long ago, are remnants of past wars, yet they linger on to echo the beautiful, heartfelt songs of the proletariat and to taunt the ruling class.  When they hear a song worth singing, they spread it far and wide.  It grows into a chorusing round, like a grassroots movement.    I'm sure this theme of rebellion is explored in the next books.  However, it's mostly in the background here, as Katniss is trying desperately to survive.  Will she be victorious?  Will she keep her humanity?  Can she change the system from within one of its grandest symbols?      5 out of 5 stars  This book is very accessible, filled with action and dramatic irony that keeps the reader on edge.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|Not many complaints to be had with the construction.  It feels solid and the screen is nice.  The keys are too squishy for my liking.  There are a good number of keys--significantly more than the n52te.  The layout could be better contoured to the hand, but no biggie.    What I dislike about it is the joystick.  The joystick is terrible.  Using it for movement made my thumb very sore--I went back to using the D-pad on my n52te, and for that reason only.  Plus, it's too sticky towards the center, and has too much give away from center.  The thumb button could also be positioned better on the outside of the joystick instead of the inside.

B00004YA0T|5.0|I bought both Jochum cycles (DG and EMI) of the Bruckner Symphonies well over a year ago and listened to them both over and over for several months. I finally reached what I thought was the saturation point and, being afraid I had over-done it, put them away for awhile. I recently decided to listen to them both straight through again, starting with the earlier DG set; finished that one and moved on to the EMI set (I'm on the 6th right now) and had to come and write a review here at Amazon. My assessment is that the later EMI set surpasses the DG set, but only slightly. They are different enough from each other to justify owning both cycles, and here is where the main difference lies: Jochum seems to have understood the spiritual profundity of Bruckner's music more deeply by the time he recorded the EMI cycle. And this is actually what becomes the listener's experience (speaking from my own experience of course). The more you listen to Bruckner, the more you \\"understand\\" Bruckner, and the transcendent spiritual quality of these symphonies. And to experience that quality, a quality so unique to Bruckner, get this wonderfully recorded and packaged box-set. You won't regret it. And you won't regret getting the earlier one either---it certainly has its own merits. But if I were to choose only one, I believe it would have to be this one.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|It was pretty funny - Tom Cruise and his character were GOLD.  I keep going back and watching the \\"dance\\" he's now famous for - it's worth buying just for that.  How Matthew McConaughey did the one scene without laughing (or maybe it was the 1,000 take - who knows, because how could he not laugh at Tom dancing like that) is amazing.  Robert Downey Jr was so good as the black guy, I never knew it was him until the end.
0547258305|4.0|Katsa is Graced with a special ability to kill. As a result, she's used as a weapon by her King - a role that she does not want or enjoy.  Eventually Katsa decides she will no longer be a pawn in a battle she doesn't agree with, and begins to disobey the King's orders.  Then, on an unsanctioned mission she discovers a mysterious stranger in the night, and worries that by leaving him alive, she's left herself in danger. But when this stranger shows up in her life again, they embark on a perilous mission in an effort to stop the greatest evil the 7 kingdoms have seen yet.    Filled with interesting and original characters, and based on a very unique concept, Graceling is the first book in what looks to be an exciting fantasy series. Katsa is a strong heroine who struggles with her anger, but learns over the course of the novel to not let it form her decisions. She's also strong in the literal sense. Her Grace allows her to kick some major butt, yet she always tries to avoid harming others unjustly. Romance takes a back seat to plot, which is a refreshing change in the YA fantasy genre. There's definitely some romance in Graceling, but none of the typical teen angst and endless swooning. One of the things I loved most about Graceling is that it was never predictable. Each time I thought I knew what was going to happen next, something completely different occurred. And while the story felt complete at the end of this novel, the author has set up the next volume beautifully - I'm not upset because I was left with a cliffhanger, and yet I can't wait to read more.    I absolutely loved Graceling! The story sucked me right in, and I want to spend more time with all these characters. I'm very much looking forward to reading Fire, the next installment in the series.

All three are of equal importance in the photo tough I sometimes forget about the effects of different iso's so this section brought that to life for me.

Another section I liked was one entitled \\"The sky brothers\\" Here Peterson talks about difficult light and contracts situations that meters have difficulty with. Peterson moves the light meeter to one area or another to get a reading that's not so effected by bad light or contrast including the always difficult photos of snow.<br /><br />Peterson also covers in detail all of the camera settings and discussed the advantages of one setting over another, aperture priority versus shutter priority etc. One of the things he covers in detail is the usage of automatic settings and how they can hinder photographic creativity.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I echo the sentiments of most of the other reviewers.    This film was INTENSE.    I have felt like crap from the age 25 onward and now I understand why.    I will never eat meat again.  I will eat more fruits and veggies.  I will buy local every chance I get.    Wow.
1401300529|3.0|As stated by other reviewers, I thought any book of 719 pages should be a fairly comprehensive history of a \\"police action.\\"  But, surprise!  When I got near the end, the final two years of the war were missing.  Made me wonder if the book was originally 1,000 pages long, but the editor just sliced out the last 300 pages as irrelevant.    I also began finding errors in some of Halberstam's \\"facts\\" beginning on page \\"x\\" [\\".82mm mortars\\" (actually 82mm); \\"2 to 5\\" mile ranges for 105mm to 8-inch guns (actually 6.5 to 13 miles)] and continuing throughout the book.  I wondered how much research he had done on WWII because most of the errors I found seemed to be associated with his background on the men and weapons of that earlier war.  But others had to do with unit sizes--a 1,000-man NK armored \\"division\\" (pg. 254) and U.S. units with \\"20 to 25\\"-man squads and 70-man platoons (pg. 258).  Interestingly, two involved MacArthur \\"legends\\" that Halberstam repeated without rebutting--the low number of MacArthur's WWII casualties (pg. 122) and his surprise that MAcArthur spent so little time in Korea (pg. 332).    MacArthur's low WWII casualty figures were a figment of his imagination and his staff's public relations machine.  As a percentage of the total number of troops in his command compared to other, comparable Army and theater commands, his casualties were higher than several others.  If MacArthur's Bataan and Corregidor casualties are included, which they certainly should be, the three armies under his command (USAFFE, Sixth Army, and Eighth Army) suffered 200,000 combat casualties during WWII.  In the 1944-1945 recapture of the Philippines alone, ground combat losses for the Sixth and Eighth Armies were more than 62,000.  And his non-combat casualties (disease, accidents, etc.) were much higher than many others.    By contrast, combining General Patton's TORCH invasion forces and II Corps (6 U.S. divisions) with his Seventh and Third Armies, his WWII combat casualtieswere approximately 70,000.  And, at the end of the European war, Patton's Third Army consisted of 18 divisions, exactly the same number of divisions as MacArthur's combined Sixth and Eighth Armies at the end of the Pacific war.    MacArthur never spent time at the front in WWII either, so it should be no surprise that he didn't five years later in Korea.  That's why the \\"Battlin' Bastards of Bataan\\" nicknamed him \\"Dugout Doug\\"--he spent all his time in the relatively safety of a tunnel on Corregidor Island, not with his embattled, sick, starving troops on Bataan.  The story goes that he set foot on the Bataan peninsula once in the three months after his troops were cut off from the rest of the Philippines and never spent a night there.  For that he received a Congressional Medal of Honor and General Wainwright got to spend nearly 3.5 years in Japanese captivity!  Again, when his army was fighting in New Guinea, MacArthur's HQ was on a separate continent in Brisbane, Australia.    What was not a surprise was Halberstam's objective--to set up the Korean War and the Democratic Party loss in the 1952 Presidential election as the basis for the U.S. committment of combat troops into Vietnam.  His view that the Kennedy-Johnson administrations could not afford \\"another Korea\\" and that the Democrats of 1960 needed to atone for being viewed as \\"soft on communism\\" was readily apparent throughout the book.    Like others, I really enjoyed reading Halberstam's gripping descriptions of actual battles and the many small unit commanders he focused on.  I just wish he had done that for many more of the early battles and for the last two years of the war when the Russians did come in (flying MIGs) and the U.S. Army and Air Force began to be equipped with newer weapons and better officers!
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|Why all this falling down and slobbering over Woody Allen? This movie was dull, unimaginative, and not connected to anything.  \\"Distant\\" relatives invite the girls to Barcelona? No one seems to be at a loss for money (an unpublished poet who lives in a country villa)? It seems that Woody just wanted to get Scarlett Johannsen and Penelope Cruz in the same movie....Woody seems to be repeating himself in movies now with similar themes emerging.  Larry David in \\"Curb your Enthusiasm\\" does in half an hour what Woody used to do in (roughly) two hours....Sorry, not worth buying or even renting.
846631993X|3.0|As&iacute; titulo el review no solo como moraleja del libro sino, como frase clave para el lector. Este libro se hace un poco tedioso durante todo el primer capitulo - hasta la pagina 102- por lo que dan ganas de dejarlo y no proseguir mas con la lectura, ya que uno no anticipa nada realmente emocionante o cautivante en esta historia. Pero si uno continua (persevera) se da con la alegre sorpresa de que la historia se va tornando emocionante e inveros&iacute;mil.<br />En cuanto a la narrativa, es dif&iacute;cil encontrar errores en los escritos de Vargas llosa, mas cabe destacar que por momentos se torna meloso y repetitivo.<br />Otro detalle importante es la sobrepoblacion de diminutivos en el vocabulario del personaje principal -Ricardo Somocurcio-. Se lo atribuyo a querer plasmar de manera muy clara el habla de la gente de Lima-Peru, lo cual es muy cierto, pero creo que llega un momento que como lector incomoda la cantidad de diminutivos con los que Vargas llosa nos bombardea en este libro.<br />Vale la pena leer este libro, no es la mejor obra de Vargas Llosa pero al menos entretiene.
B003RUZKC8|2.0|This movie was cheesy.  Acting was terrible and many scenes came off as awkward. To bad, it started off looking like it was going to be a fun movie... nope, I kept on torchering myself to very end of it, in the hope that it would get better. Ok, there where some cool action scenes, but not worth your time....

0385341008|5.0|I am American, but I was brought up as a pretty rabid Anglophile, and my father served in the Bristish navy during world war II after the Intrepid (now in the Hudson River in NYC) was kamikazed for the last time.  I have always admired the British stiff upper lip and sense of sacrifice for the common good.  This book points all this up in spades.  It made me laugh and made me cry and made me proud of my Scottish/English heritage.  I have recommended it to everyone I know unqualifiedly.
1416972250|5.0|The Mortal Instrument series is one of my favorite book I've ever read. City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass and I can't wait for the fourth one to come out. It's worth spending time with Jace and Clary. Love the characters in this story.
B002YCVX5S|1.0|Disregarding my opinion on the movie, this is a review about hiring Inglorious Basterds through the Amazon Video-On-Demand service.<br /><br />I hire movies regularly through Amazon, and have enjoyed the experience so far. Having never had a problem before, I'm posting this review as I suspect it might be relevant to this particular file/video and it might help anyone else wishing to watch it!<br /><br />Throughout the film, there were random frames from other scenes inserted every few minutes, making the viewing experience seriously distracting. At first I thought it might be Tarantino doing his \\"unique\\" thing (hah), as well as it being a familiar device with Brad Pitt on-screen (Fight Club). However, it had no relevance to the film and a quick Google seems to indicate no-one else commenting about the strange frames. Similarly, three times during the film everything went black and the FBI's piracy warning (as seen at the start) came up on screen...promptly disappearing before I could reach for my mouse to figure out what was going on. As mentioned earlier, I've never had a problem with the Video-On-Demand service using this computer/internet connection, and given that it's always worked perfectly with previous hires/purchases, I can only surmise that something's wrong with this particular stream.<br /><br />Quite frankly, it ruined the movie for me because I was never able to concentrate on what was happening - the regular FBI piracy warnings and random frame inserts throughout were too distracting. I'm disappointed...the idea of making relatively small payments to watch something legally is something I very much support - at least everyone gets something that they want (customer and producer alike). That said, if the legal option is giving a sub-par performance and ruining the experience that people are paying for, perhaps the P2P piracy issue won't be going away as quickly as Hollywood would like.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|\\"NCIS: Los Angeles\\" is a spin-off of the popular TV drama series \\"NCIS\\", short for Naval Criminal Investigative Service.  NCIS: LA, first pitched in a cross-over episode on NCIS, features the work of an undercover team from the Office of Special Projects, located in a confiscated villa in Los Angeles.  Its mission is to deal with criminals, terrorists and spies who threaten national security.<br /><br />\\"NCIS: Los Angeles\\", a younger, hipper version of the original, took a little while to find its footing.  Its early selling point was the wonderful buddy team chemistry of special agents G. Callen and Sam Hanna, played with zest by Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.  Their verbal sparring and collaboration is a highlight of the show.<br /><br />The team roster took awhile to settle.  The increasing prominence given Linda Hunt as eccentric Operations Manager Hetty Lange provided balance and wry humor.  Daniela Ruah as field agent Kensi Blye quickly established her street credentials; the show was challenged to find her a suitable partner.  That partner is likely to be LA undercover cop Marty Deeks, who did a guest stint and will return for Season Two. Barrett Foa as computer geek Eric Beal and Peter Cambor as psychologist Nate Getz provided superb backup.<br /><br />The first season episodes pitted the team against terrorists, gun smugglers, spies and assorted bad guys, while managing to combine action, humor, and a little soul-searching.  Along the way, one agent was kidnapped and killed and others were placed at risk, while viewers were introduced to the mystery of G. Callen's origins.  Rocky Carroll as NCIS Director Vance and Pauley Perrette as forensic investigator Abby Scuto did nice crossovers from NCIS.<br /><br />\\"NCIS: Los Angeles - The First Season\\" is highly recommended to fans of NCIS who might be looking for a different take in a different town.
B00095NX9G|5.0|My belly dance style is pretty much Egyptian Cabaret. I have only taken about a two dozen classes in Tribal Style belly dance. I watched Serpentine with my dance teacher Alnisa Robin Wood. We thoroughly enjoyed it. From a safety stand point, she gives a wonderful posture and warm up section with tutorials on bending backwards as well as a few other movement jewels. This DVD is mandatory for anyone who wants to add a special 'something' to their dance without getting hurt. For the money it's so economical. Her mini classes allow the student to not become overwhelmed and she even gives you a workout plan if you are a person who doesn't have much time or a workout plan if you have plenty of time. Isolations are not always easy but she makes the isolation drills doable as she reminds you that with practice, you will achieve your goal along with doable helpful hints. Every choreography is broken down into sections so that the student doesn't feel overwhelmed and can learn at their own pace. Her arms are beautiful and your arms will be also. Even though I dance cabaret, I know I will be incorporating some of her arm and turn movements into my dance. Her leg strengthening section is helping me after two knee surgeries and a major spine surgery. I love that safety is a PRIORITY and she gives you a point by point posture check. And then...a beautiful inspiring performance as only Rachael can do!...Beautiful costumes!...Like I said, I have prefered to express myself with Egyptian Cabaret and have only taken two dozen Tribal Style classes, but I will benefit from this DVD!..and I didn't even mention her yoga and body strengthening sessions!..Very few belly dance DVD's go down as a contribution to our art...but this one is!
0061714372|2.0|If you're looking for a book about drugs then this book is for you. If like me you're hoping to find out about Mustaine the musician,composer etc then forget it. He hardly talks about his songs - throws a title of a song here and there - not much more.Plus there's things he's ommited like the fact that he's Jewish, or say Chris Poland playing on \\"The system has failed\\" etc - makes you wonder what other important stuff is missing. A wasted opportunity.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Having read John Green's first novel, Looking for Alaska, and loving it, I decided to pick this one up and give it a try.<br /><br />Though not nearly as important and astounding as Alaska, Paper Towns provides an entertaining story, wonderful character development, and amusing one-liners, keeping readers enticed all the way through.  The main character, Quentin, is extremely likeable.  Most readers will be able to instantly connect.  His crush, Margo Roth Spiegelman, is funny, loveable, and the girl of all teenage boys' dreams.  Green writes these characters so convincingly, I'm almost positive everything that happened in the book actually happened to him, and he merely changed names around while writing it all out.<br /><br />Recommendation: Read Looking for Alaska if you haven't.  If you have, pick this one up.  Don't expect Paper Towns to be better, because I'm absolutely positive it is not.  However, this book is lovely in its own rite, and it absolutely deserves a read from any John Green lover.
0670034711|1.0|I read this book because my wife wanted me to. I hated it. There was plenty of good writing, but every time Ms. Gilbert fell into a weepy pile of self-pity on the floor I wanted to scream. Everybody has problems. A friend of my daughter's was diagnosed with brain cancer two years after finishing college. Now there's somebody with a serious problem, but she hasn't let it stop her from getting married and going on with her life. I can't even begin to understand the appeal of this book.
B002ZG983M|1.0|Disgusting. \\"Kick Ass\\" is enough to give you impressional indigestion for a long time. It is difficult to see who this movie is oriented to. It is too puerile, too comic book, for any thinking adult and much too violent for teens or kids. The assumption is a few dork teen kids become  \\"superheroes\\" by putting on masks and tights, (without any superpowers). And fight thug bad guys.<br /><br />Kids and friends get graphically beat up, gouged knifed, shot. There is a sweet little girl maybe 11, played by Chloe Moretz, who gets into a fist fight with villain Mark Strong who is more than a foot taller and outweighs her by 100 lbs. Gratuitous wincing violence. There are a lot of movies like Batman and Superman where there is comic book violence. This is not one of those.  Don't pollute your mind with this pointless ultraviolent trash. If you have kids, or young kids, I recommend you resist allowing your children to.<br /><br />It is a sad day for this country, for the world, when this junk is considered \\"entertainment\\". Repulsive.

He's had to make something new up for Reacher for a lot of pages now, and done a decent job so far. Sure his descriptions are long and arduous, and sometimes I wonder how Reacher can even claim to be an expert on anything (I think he's OCD more than anything) after doing nothing but wandering around the country for 10 years, but eh...I give him the benefit of the doubt.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I couldn't wait for the package to arrive with the new Em cd \\"Recovery\\".  I listened to it about 4 times all the way through and quickly came to the conclusion that not only is this one of Eminem's best CDs, this may very well be one of the best rap CDs of all time.  The CD features a drug free Eminem smashing beats with amazing heartfelt, and soulful lyrics .  His passion truly shines throughout this disc and he goes hard at everyone.....including himself.<br /><br />I am big fan of Em's and think that he is a true lyrical poet.  This CD is easily his best effort to date and may go down as one of the best of all time.  If you like amazing hip hop and jaw dropping lyrics, this CD is for you.  Buy it, listen to it for a few days and sit back and marvel at one of the greatest artist of our generation.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0061730327|5.0|\\"The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind\\"<br />  by William Kamkwamba<br />  and Bryan Mealer<br /><br />Book Review by Jay Gilbertson<br /><br />\\"Before I discovered the miracles of science, magic ruled the world...\\" So begins the autobiographical story of how wind changed one boy's world and knocked the socks off his proud parents!<br /><br />  The story is actually three tales all woven together with one of my favorite words--hope. Young William grew up in a village in Malawi (sub-Saharan Africa) where electricity was scarce, maize was the staple food and starvation was never far away. One of the many interesting daily life-of-William-tidbits he shares is that regardless of how very poor his people are there exists a deep personal respect for one another. This honor sustains the community and is what keeps the village functioning and whole in difficult times.<br /><br />  Where in America public education is free to all, in William's village there is basic education--but it comes with a price tag. William does indeed begin school as the maize crop that particular year yielded extra money to pay the $80 tuition (average per capita income per year is $160) but a drought came, as it often did, and he's forced to drop. Yet William isn't one to sit around and mope, off he tromps to the local `library' and it is there that he finds a book that will ultimately change his life: Using Energy.<br /><br />  As a boy, William was intrigued by how things worked. Since electricity for televisions in most parts of Africa didn't exist, most people listened to small, hand-held radios. From Malawian reggae or American rhythm and blues from Radio Two in Blantyre, (a city in Malawi) or Chichewa (Malawian language) gospel choirs and church sermons from Lilongwe (capital of Malawi). He and his cousin began to take these small devices apart in order to learn how they worked. This, in turn, led him to discover the mechanical dynamo. It's the small generator that powers a light for a bike and coupled with a windmill, William literally turns on the lights in his parent's home. This is only the beginning.<br /><br />  Through much trial and error and an endless stockpile of discarded gears and pipes and wires, William built his crude windmill to generate a few precious volts. This discovery sparked an interest in the press who spread the word of his `invention.' The prying news reporter's stories soon swept William into a journey that literally changed his life, his village and...I'm not telling you anything else--you'll have to read it for yourself!<br /><br />  One of the other wonderful concepts that leapt out of William's story is inspiration rich with gratitude. He ends with:<br /><br />\\"I hope this story finds its way to our brothers and sisters out there who are trying to elevate themselves and their communities, but who may feel discouraged by their poor situation. I want them to know they're not alone...\\"<br /><br />  This is one juicy story full of angst and struggle, death and dust and endless heat. It has the power of wind and the magic of a boy called William Kamkwamba. I can't wait for you to meet him.<br /><br />For more details and some incredible videos of William:<br />[…]This, in turn, led him to discover the mechanical dynamo.

0307269752|5.0|\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\"<br />  by Steig Larsson<br /><br />Book Review by Jay Gilbertson<br /><br />When strolling through the stacks at our wonderful library in Menomonie, marveling at all those new arrivals, I go a little nuts. Shelf after shelf of possibilities then--the one--picks me and I'm done for. That's what happened when author Stieg's novel grabbed my attention. Grabbed--good grief--I was totally and completely obsessed with the darn thing and I don't normally go for anything remotely connected to the all-to-predictable thriller genre. But this baby had something so off the charts different it stunned me. The characters in his web-like story were utterly compelling.<br /><br />  The tale opens with one of my favorite author-ly tricks; a prologue. Exhibit A: a mysterious pressed flower arrives--again. Exhibit B: enter mystery-solver and Sweden's renowned magazine editor/owner the dashing Mikael Blomkvist. Lastly, (but not really seeing as this is the first in a trilogy) exhibit C: one cannot properly solve any kind of mystery now days without a quirky, self-loathing, possible Asperger Syndrome sufferer, pierced and tattooed like nobody's business--computer hacking genius (with really great legs) Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />  The cast of characters is vast and the pace is pitch-perfect as long as you keep in mind that the story is written in a very journalistic tone. By this I mean, often times Stieg will list off what a character is wearing or eating or surrounded by as if simply reporting the news, and that was a tad off-putting. The thrill-part is how Blomkvist and Salander uncover just who the dickens murdered dear Harriet Vanger forty years past and, by-the-way, where did her body go? That's assuming she was indeed murdered... What they do uncover is far more ghastly and far-reaching and just plain disgusting than I bet even Stephen King could have come up with!<br /><br />  Toss in a filthy rich old man on his deathbed, an enormously complicated family tree full of nasty and terribly incestuous (as well as totally dysfunctional) relations each out to get the other, and you have just the tip of the iceberg that is The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I might add, seeing as I am a rather private fellow, there were several scenes that not only shocked the heck out of me, but also made me blush. Very R-rated, if you get my drift. Oh, and I should mention, the author `mysteriously' died after penning the final draft of the third novel in this series.<br /><br />  This is a roller-coaster ride of a novel and I honestly don't recall the last time I was so consumed with not only an insanely complex story-line(s) but the sheer brutality of some of Stieg's characters was at times both shocking and (I hate to admit this) just so satisfying. Don't just sit there wondering, buzz over to the library and get on the waiting list.<br /><br />  As you dive into TGWTDT, keep this in mind: A picture is worth a thousand words--now go!<br /><br />For more information about the author:<br />[...]d man on his deathbed, an enormously complicated family tree full of nasty and terribly incestuous (as well as totally dysfunctional) relations each out to get the other, and you have just the tip of the iceberg that is The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

1416972242|5.0|As I mentioned when I reviewed City of Bones, I am officially hooked. After reading the first book in the Mortal Instruments Series I was compelled to walk right over to my bookshelf and pluck the next one to devour and the situation is no different this time around. I have already started City of Glass this morning. I also thought that City of Bones was really well written but Cassandra's writing style became even more fluid in her second book. Cassandra Clare has a way of making you feel like you are truly watching the story unfold in front of you. It's like when you are watching TV and the killer corners the damsel in distress, she screams and then.....it flips to another story line/commercial. I felt like she did this to me a lot (and no I am not saying that there are commercials in the book lol). I was left going \\"Wait! What happened to *insert character here*?\\" and anxiously reading on to find out. The suspense is intense at times.     After the devastating realization that the guy she loves is her long lost brother, Clary is left feeling like the rug has been ripped out from under her. Everything has changed. Clary is a Shadowhunter, her best friend Simon is in love with her, her mother is in a magically induced coma, her biological father is a evil mastermind, and her mom's best friend (her father figure) is a werewolf. Yep, I think we can say that Clary has her hands full at the moment.    Jace is also crushed to learn that the girl he loves is really his sister and he is not who he always thought he was. Now the second of the Mortal Instruments is stolen and the Clave thinks that Jace may be aiding his father, Valentine, in his pursuit. Now Downworlder children are turning up dead, drained of blood. Can they clear Jace's name and stop Valentine before he can execute his plan?     Cassandra Clare really ups the stakes with this one and I love her for it. But Can I just say that in life when ever you want to tell someone something and they say \\"No, me first\\"DON'T LISTEN! Jace and Clary, you are killing me! I never thought I would be saying, \\"Who cares if you are brother and sister, you are clearly meant to be!\\" I know I am one sick puppy....lol Don't be like me and put this book off any longer. If you have not picked it up run, don't walk to your nearest bookstore/library and grab the series. You will not regret it. I know that I don't!    [...]
B002WTC8RA|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\"<br />  by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows<br /><br />Book Review by Jay Gilbertson<br /><br />Do you remember the clever novel \\"84, Charing Cross Road?\\" It had to be the most clear-cut example of how nosey we all are--I loved it!<br /><br />  \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\\" is just such a book; the entire novel is a collection of letters written in 1946, right after the end of WWII. From war-torn London to the recently German-occupied island of Guernsey, an entire world is about to be flung open--and you're invited.<br /><br />  Meet Juliet Ashton, a thirty-something aspiring author looking for her next big thing to write about. Out of the blue she receives a note from Dawsey Adams, a resident of Guernsey, requesting help in locating a particular book. Juliet takes on the task with zeal and soon is introduced to an entire cast of characters. The `society' was created on the spur of the moment late one night when a group of islanders were caught outside after the German-imposed curfew. It was the brainchild of a brilliant woman that you will surely come to admire. And yes, they really did eat potato peel pie--I don't recommend it.<br /><br />  In the course of this often-lively exchange of letters, many of the members not only share their own literary favorites, but also reveal bits and pieces of themselves. Such as the fear your child will never be seen again, making do with no soap at the end of the month, sneaking a dead pig from house to house and all of them wondering if Elizabeth McKenna would ever come home. As the `story' moves deeper into more personal exchanges, one member's name is woven into nearly all the accounts of how they survived. This woman--the true heroine of this tale--is one you never meet, and without tossing out a spoiler, let's just say you root for her all the way. In the end, you learn that even though sometimes you're dealt a losing hand, somewhere there's a joker ready to bring in the sun...<br /><br />  The main reason this particular novel rang so true with me was that underneath all their struggles with day-to-day life, the darkness that shrouded their every moment didn't smother that one thing we cling to no matter what--hope. The authors were related, Barrows is the niece of Schaffer who, unfortunately, passed away in February 2008. This was a true work of love as it was Barrows lifetime dream to write a book that would be published and Schaffer made sure that dream came true. This novel, packed full of truly endearing characters (and a few I wanted to smack) is a wonderful reminder of the depth of human spirit. When we hold each other up, nothing can bring us down--nothing...<br /><br />  One of author Shaffer's characters says, \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\" Perhaps so, but here, it simply doesn't apply.<br /><br />Enjoy the adventure--and should you ever visit Guernsey--please greet Juliet for me!<br /><br />For more information about the author(s) please visit:<br />[...]osing hand, somewhere there's a joker ready to bring in the sun...

B000063DFN|5.0|Not much to add. This is one of the best metal albums ever made. I can't really rank it in terms of their other six great studio albums and Live After Death because they are all so awesome. Obviously, it is better than anything that they produced after Seventh Son and it is better than all other metal albums except for QR Operation Mindcrime. That is really all you need to know. Go buy it!
0385523386|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It is one of the few memoirs that has a perfect blend of character and experience without getting too preachy. Her story is basically, \\"This is what I did. I screwed up and it got me in jail. Here's how I survived it. It's not what you think.\\" I have occasionally thought about what prisoners go through during their sentences, so I was immediately drawn into Kerman's story. She really owns up to her crime and I can feel for her and her family as she pays the consequences for the person she used to be. Not many of us are forced to face a ten year-old demon and that experience alone was interesting. It was more interesting to meet her fellow inmates and learn the every day interactions. You can read about Kerman's change without her having to tell you about it - it's all seen in her interactions with the other prisoners. I think this book is beautifully done. I can't wait for an epilogue story and the follow up with some of the other inmates who are now released!<br /><br />I have read a lot of reviews calling her self-righteous. I think that's off-base. I think she's pretty upfront about what she's done and that her situation is better than most. She's not your typical prisoner, but I don't think she's looking for sympathy. I think she wants you to know what her experience was and her insights on how we can make the penal system more effective. Let's face it, most of the other people we met in this book can't get a book deal. They don't have the education to write the manuscript or the access to the publishing world. Kerman does and she used that to her advantage. You wouldn't get to hear about these ladies otherwise. She's not the next Samuel Barrow or anything, but I truly think that her motivation to write this book is pure.
B002XUBDVK|1.0|If this is a movie that you would like to see with blu-ray resolution and color depth, you are going to have to wait.  This disk is a mess; it is no better than the DVD release and that was technically poor.  I do not understand how a major studio would approve.  It is like early CD releases where no effort was made to take advantage of the new format.  Many of those early releases have since been truly remastered, sometimes spectacularly, by a sound engineer who knew what he was doing.  Let's hope that someone cares enough to do a second blu-ray release for this film.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is by far one of my most treasured posessions. Not only does the set contain all the songs that I loved while growing up, it opens my mind with the ones that I had never heard of before! I now can put my old LPs back in the attic and listen to the CDs eveywhere I go. Fantastic collection, highly recommended!
0399156577|5.0|The Search was the perfect book for me! It had it all...interesting dog story line, hot couple, dastardly serial killer/s, and a beautiful backdrop for the story. Since it was so tailored to me, I realize that everyone may not feel the same. If you're not really into the dog part of the storyline, please realize that Nora researches everything that goes into her books, so that she can give vivid details. Maybe I wasn't as excited about storylines in other books (like art, perhaps), but I still managed to learn from it and enjoy the story even if it wasn't my \\"thing.\\"      I also  liked Simon...although he was somewhat of an \\"anti-hero\\" at times, he had a soft center, and was exactly who Fiona needed him to be.  Any man who can hang in there when his puppy eats his new pickup is ok in my book!     The romance in the book was well done and enjoyable. I thought there were more love scenes than usual and that they were hot....in that tastefully-done-Nora-Roberts sort of way.     Five stars for the book all the way...I wish I could give it more to balance out the haters who don't like dogs and who couldn't see past Simon's outer shell to the man beneath.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is extremely informative and a bit shocking. I wasn't expecting to see some of the things that were in this movie. I like that the documentary isn't trying to make the viewer a vegetarian or paranoid. It really made me think of my food in a different way. I will try to buy organic and fresh produce when I can. Food Inc. covers a wide range of food from meat and poultry to produce and soy beans. I have to admit watching the pig portion of the movie did bring some tears to my eyes. I am glad this movie was made so that more people like myself can be better informed about the food we eat. I highly recommend watching this.
0061122416|1.0|The Alchemist was recommended to me by a friend, so I gave it a chance despite my reservations after seeing it compared to Jonathon Livingston Seagull. Unfortunately, the comparison is accurate. Both books are preachy, repetitive, trite, have no literary value and contain only flat male characters. The one female in this book is a one-dimensional desert woman whose appearance is limited to a few pages, and whose only ambition in life is to wait for her man. The only real difference I saw between the two books is that The Alchemist takes a lot longer to deliver the same message without actually delivering more content.  At least Jonathon Livingston Seagull was short.    The Alchemist is a flimsy, contrived story built around a message, and that message gets repeated over and over, in the same exact words.  If I wanted to get pounded over the head with a moral, I would go to church or preschool rather than read a book that claims to be \\"literature\\".  You may like this book if you like being told what to think, but don't expect to get an elegant, interesting or even entertaining story.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Unlike most people I got a great sense of what this movie was from the trailer and director interviews on TV.  This is without a doubt a huge cult classic in the making.  Like the Austin Powers movies the first one was bound to go unappreciated until the DVD came out (or in Austin's case, the Video).  Now it's finding its audience and there's no stopping it.  The sequel is bound to blow the doors off at the theaters too and I can't wait.      As for the stink people are making about the brilliant Chloe Mortez as Hit Girl, they should grow a pair.  I can't stand these people.  Personally, if you don't absolutely love this movie I don't even want to know you.  If you asked me what my favorite movie of all time was right now I'd say \\"KICK ASS!\\"
B000V86OKG|1.0|I order Dexter second season, i waited, I had to e-mail the vendor several times, only to find out I woud not receive my order until 35 days later, I received a refund. I still don't have the DVD's I wanted.
B003E48AYC|5.0|Very happy with this DVD set. It arrived so fast I could hardly believe it.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Great device.  the sound quality is crystal clear. On a whim, I decided to connect it to my car via an audio jack. OMG, my factory stereo sounded great for the first time using this device. Of course, I purchased it to increase the volume of my crappy mp3 player. The side effect of hearing a more robust range of sound was truely impressive.    The increased volume was enough to meet my needs. Oh - my needs - I like ear-bleeding volume!
B000002I97|5.0|This is one of those rare collections of songs where every single offering is strikingly deep, perfectly crafted, and compellingly beautiful.  The insinuating lines of the chord changes, the open, sparse production quality, the top-notch sidemen (is the \\"Starday Records\\"-sounding steel guitar possibly the same gentleman (Leo LeBlanc???) that played on some of the mid 60's-era Red Simpson \\"truck drivin'\\" albums???).  And then - we get to the LYRICS...  And I am not personally someone who normally pays much, if any, attention to lyrics, but the combination of the striking vocal twang of Tennessee-via-Melrose Park, combined with some of the most compelling story-telling this side of Hank Williams, adds up to arguably one of the most perfect first albums ever recorded.  Words alone cannot do this album justice - it must be heard.  The heartbreak of \\"Donald and Lydia\\", the plaintive but wacky \\"Illegal Smile\\", the epic \\"Angel from Montgomery\\" - just to name a few - are a small part of this baker's dozen of instant classics.  Definitely a \\"desert-island\\" selection.
0525478183|5.0|Good quality and also in the top 3 of the best book I've read this year.
067003830X|1.0|This book is utterly useless and outright dangerous. It provides false sense of security to people who are suffering. Neural plasticity is very limited and can be very difficult to measure its results.    The entire book is debunked by professors  Christopher F. Chabris and Daniel Simons  from Harvard and University of Illinois in their excellent work -    The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us    http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Gorilla-Other-Intuitions-Deceive/dp/0307459659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281707218&sr=1-1    Using the  statistical testing framework they debunk all the non sense this permeates.    Phantom limbs described by VS Ramachandran is true but does not work the other way round. If you lose a part of the brain u lose that functionality forever and neural plasticity cannot do anything to replace it.    Finally I will tell you one thing \\"CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSALITY\\" so many cases in this are just mere coincidences and without a statistical testing framework they are just useless.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I do not know how I have made it this long without this little bad a$$.  It is fast, effective, and very affordable.  Are there better sharpeners out there? Yes..For this price and size? NO.  I have it on a key chain and can put a fine edge on any piece of steel in just a few strokes.  I love it, and will be buying them for years to come.  My only concern with this item is the plastic.  I dont know how long the case will hold up, but I am not too worried as I am very pleased with the quality already.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Oh yeah!  This ain't no bingo parlor, the old folks home is exploding with a vengenance!  Even though they've got more arthritis and wrinkles now than muscles, the geriatric gods of cinema all unite for a back-breakin', hip-dislocatin', memory-erasin', braindead action-packed thrill ride.<br /><br />Sly busts his old buddies out of the cocoon with a bang.  Of course most of their screen time is handicapped by their astronomical pricetags.  Still it was fun to see them all make an appearance in one flick.  The writing does feel pretty rushed, the story is incoherent and predictable...but who cares?  This is all about the bullets, the booms, and bad guys getting killed by all our ancient heroes.<br /><br />Sly and Stratham lead a pack of good-hearted mercenaries ready to put their life on the line for some cold hard cash.  One of their covert missions lead them down to South America to take out a ruthless dictator.  The job seems a little too tough for them but of course a hot chick makes them reconsider.  The odds are pretty insurmountable, but that doesn't matter for this pack of macho men.  Time to grab the dentures and go save a third world country.<br /><br />Willis and Swartzenegger have very small roles, just a few minutes of screen time.  Li, Lungren, Couture, Crews, and Rourke get a few more moments in the spotlight.  But Stallone and Stratham dominate the action here.  Lots of flying daggers and stuff getting blown up.  Some CGI moments do look kinda fake, but not too horribly bad.  There are definitely some gruesome, eye-popping deaths that will get your blood flowing.<br /><br />Never a dull moment here.  This has to be the greatest action star ensemble of all time, hands down.  If you're looking for the blockbuster event of the summer, it all Depends on The Expendables!  (3.5 stars)

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Everything is flying.  I was hesistant about spending the extra money for this over the 955be.  I figure the six cores might be too much.  Well, since I multi-task like all get out, I have not been disappointed.  No slowdowns yet even when downloading and playing games at the same time.    It comes with a decent cooler/fan too.  Although I believe the fan on my cpu cooler may have bad ball bearings because it grinds like all get out when the cpu is under load.    As another poster said, make sure your MB Bios can support it.  My MSI Board needed an update to enable all features of the chip.    In the end the 955be might be better price/performance waypoint but I am a happy guy right now for getting the 6 core 1090T.    I will post an update if I have any problems.    UPDATE    OK, so I found out it is not the fan on the cpu cooler that is making the noise.  It is my gtx480 fan that makes lots of noise when the card gets hot.  So I take back what I said about the ball bearing shaving gone bad.  So... the stock cooler that comes with this CPU works well for me.    Hail Flavius!
1892005034|5.0|I was impressed with how well written this book was, as well as the amount of thought and insight contained in it. The huge steps I've taken in the past 2 years toward peace, self-acceptance, and realization of my potential seem to have come from attending workshops and classes based on this book. When I re-read Nonviolent Communication, I find bits I missed the other times. The chapter on self-empathy is particularly helpful on the problem of self-acceptance. I always had a lot of trouble with the phrases of you deserve, you were born with basic rights.  The author helps the reader see all parts of themself, which helps them make choices that are aligned with their individual priorites and values. To me, Nonviolent Communication, the book, is a superb guide to healing, and life, helping me to be how I want to be in the world. I had a hard time with the language the first time I read it, and I know that some of it could be said more beautifully, but I've read it several times now (the second time I started with the last chapter I liked it more than the first), and given it to people. Here's why: When  This is a core value or belief for me and I suspect that if you really can't accept that concept, the book would not be so useful and healing in yor situation. The book goes on to show examples of thinking that gets in the way of living this core value. Most wonderful of all, it offers tools to help us live in accordance with our values. Some of the tools are: the idea that feelings point to met or unmet needs; the list of needs; the differentiation of needs from strategies to meet needs; examples of how to find the feelings and needs in some common scenarios; the insistence on separating observations from judgments; the idea of listening for the needs underlying a person's words; the explanation of feelings as having internal origin rather than being 'caused' by others, etc.
0143118420|2.0|The book is beautifully written, but I found the author/protagonist shallow, self-absorbed and pretentious.<br />.<br />I was turned off at the opening when she walked out on her husband for unspecified reasons (i.e. \\"not fulfilling my emotional needs\\") and then had the balls to be surprised when he was hurt and lashed back.<br />.<br />Another reviewer, \\"Wanjugo,\\" nailed it when she wrote: \\"Many people say it was courageous for her to leave him, but the word selfish kept coming to my mind. Also thought about the DOUBLE STANDARDS in the American culture because a man who leaves his wife because he is sad in the marriage I bet would not sell so many books.\\"<br />.<br />This is appeals to the modern woman who, in a 21st version of Cinderella, expects her husband to satisfy all of her emotional and spiritual needs while supplying her with regular orgasms.<br />.<br />This book did not push my buttons at all.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Looks like amazon is going to keep them. UP for a bit longer. When the first year started, I lived in virgina, or cable could get the first network it was on. Then halfway though the first season we moved. To Nevada, alas the the \\"Enterpise\\" network was not on there line-up. Wacthing reruns, they seem to show the same ones over again and again. So I found them on Amazon. Still waiting for them, to come done in price! When my wait was over I found season 1 in Walmart, for $19.95! Not the $50.99 they have it listed for here. So excuse me as I go wacth more. The first disk played fine.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Have you noticed that each new doctor gets a bit of \\"nay saying\\".  I didn't think anyone could follow after Christopher Eccleston... and then came David Tennant - who redefined the role.  I thought no one could take his place... and then I saw Matt Smith.  I didn't want to like him after the 10th Doctor said, \\"I don't want to go.\\"<br /><br />As I watched the 11th hour and watched Smith as number 11, in the scene that I can only say \\"beans are evil\\", I saw that the role had been redefined again.  He is awesome!
0399156577|3.0|I love Nora Roberts books but this wasn't her best. I was really looking forward to reading it as it soundind exciting. If she went more into the murders and the stalking it would have been a lot more interesting. Instead the story focused mainly on the dog training. It was still ok but could have been more interesting.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|With the exception of ep9 (Ab Aeterno) - season 6 of LOST sucked hard.  For me, Ab Aeterno is ep2 of season 5, and Juliet blew up LOST at the end of season 5.  OMG, season 6 was such a major letdown.  You could really tell, ep to ep, that season 6 was written nowhere near as well as or with as much zeal as ANY of the first 5 seasons.  I will buy season 6, to complete my LOST series on DVD, only because I need ep9 (Ab Aeterno)... but I will wait until it hits rock-bottom pricing.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|There's so many good reviews here regarding this release.  I've had it since its release and still enjoy it immensely.  I'm posting this review b/c I just listened to it in its entirety via headphones and it just got better.  There's so much more info, it's almost like a re-release.  If you appreciate sonically intricate recordings, this, as well as most Radiohead releases is a complete joy to hear w/ some cans on your ears.  This record stands out, however, in that there's not as much extra digital noise tracks that these guys pepper their records with, which I often find bothersome.  So I'll rank it near the top, just behind the OK Computer masterpiece.
1401207529|2.0|Really was disappointed in this novel especially considering all the hype it gets.  The story is very short and is mostly about Gordon's rise through the ranks than it is about Batman.  In fact, there is very little about Batman in the novel to begin with so do not expect to get the details about Batman like you did with Batman Begins.  Also, as someone has mentioned, the novel seems to go nowhere and just when you think it is about to begin its over.  The other major flaw is the artwork which is probably the worst you will ever see from a professional.  The only positive I saw in this novel was the move towards realism. Other than that, there really isn't anything of value in this book.
0451529065|4.0|My four-star rating is more for this particular product than for the work of Darwin itself. Clearly Darwin's book is the cornerstone of modern biology, and I won't even pretend to try to rate its importance using one to five stars.<br /><br />However, I felt it was important to let people know that this is the *sixth* edition of the book. I ordered it thinking it was the first, although I admit I had no reason to believe that other than that it did not specify that it was any other edition. The main problem with later editions is that Darwin continually responded to his critics in subsequent editions, thus changing some aspects of his theory. He also added the obnoxious concession &#34;by the Creator&#34; to his beautiful final sentence in order to appease the religious critics. The sixth (final) edition even has an extra chapter in response to criticisms by Catholic biologist George Mivart (which chapter is present in this edition, thus proving it is the sixth edition).<br /><br />The benefit to later editions would be that they contain minor corrections to the writing, as well as these answers to objections and criticism, but at the same time I don't feel that Darwin's answers needed to be added to the book itself. &#34;The Origin&#34; should simply present his theory (as the first edition does) and he could easily have answered his critics in other ways and not by editing the actual theory itself.<br /><br />But to reiterate my main point, I am not reviewing the actual work of Darwin. I am posting this review to inform people of which edition they are getting with this particular book, because I wish I had known in advance.<br /><br />Edit: I should add that the copy I received did not have the same cover as what is displayed here. My copy shows a bird, a wildcat, and a dolphin on the cover. The cover shown on the product page at the time of writing is of a ship. However, my copy is still the 150th Anniversary Edition (Signet Classics) with an introduction by Julian Huxley.ian Huxley.

B00275EGWY|2.0|The Hurt Locker, 2008 film    The film starts in \\"Bagdad 2004\\". American soldiers arrive at a street. A robot machine inspects a pile of rags. Goats roam in the streets. A wheel falls off a cart, a soldier dresses in protective gear to inspect the bomb. A man fingers a cell phone, the bomb explodes. A package is sealed for shipping. We see another patrol on the streets to check for a reported bomb. A car goes past the troops, then stops. The soldier disarms the fuse on the bomb. But there are six more! They are disarmed. Some soldiers play video games. Peddlers sell DVDs. Later there is another car to inspect. A shot causes a fire. \\"He's not going to make it.\\" The truck is filled with 155mm shells. The wires are cut. He searches for the main fuse and cuts it. \\"873!\\"    There is talk with an advisor. There's more drama at an explosion site. They find four armed men with an SUV in the desert. There is an ambush! A sniper hits soldiers from a distance. Can they reach him? A jammed magazine is cleared. They wait to aim again. One soldier spots an insurgent crawling along the bridge by the goats. They later relax with rough humor. The specialist collects souvenirs. The conversation reveals their past lives. [Does loneliness cause drinking?] The Colonel goes for a ride. They search an abandoned building. They find a load of explosives and a dead body. \\"What is he doing?\\" A bomb hits the Colonel! Could a DVD merchant be a spy for the insurgents?    The specialist gets a ride to a house. Who was responsible for \\"Beckham\\"? He flees the house. James is summoned for a new mission. People flee from a \\"suicide bombing\\". Or was it a remote detonation? They search the alleys. A burst of gunfire is a warning. The soldier is rescued, but wounded. A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? \\"I hate this place.\\" The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? \\"The olderyou get the fewer things you really love.\\" [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?    This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson? Was it designed to straddle the line between pro-war and anti-war so an audience could read their own feelings into it? \\"War is a drug\\" is just nonsense. Wars are fought to exploit property and people. Whenever you read about conflict over some barren desert you can be sure there is mineral wealth involved. Those who are involved in combat (or other sports) can get an adrenaline high, but that is hardly a \\"drug\\".
1416585710|1.0|Trust me, this is the bad patois.  This is the bottom of the barrel for SK.  Half the book could easily be omitted, as is usually the case with SK's novels.  Is it not the editor's job?  But perhaps the editor is afraid of losing Stephen King's business.  I suppose he is only interested in misspellings and grammatical errors, and oh yeah, not offending the god of horror.  But those misspellings and grammatical errors would gladly be traded by faithful readers for a leaner, more readable novel, which this is not.  Don't get me wrong, it's not so much that it's bad writing--the genius of King's writing is still here--but it's the plot that ultimately fails.  King claims he doesn't write using a plot, but neither should he put down everything that first comes to mind.  And where the plot fails is near the end where it loses its believability.<br /><br />Ever read a story that made you want to puke?  That made you light-headed, made you want to dunk your head in a bucket of water for all eternity?  I tried to finish this foolishness, this boolishness, but when Lisey resorted to using her vegetable sister Amanda to ward off the villain, Dooley, I could not take any more.  I kept hoping Dooley would make his reappearance and kick-start the story once again but was thwarted by King's bad gunky writing.  I had put up with babyluv, Fairy Forests,  silver shovels (not so bad, that), magic pools, bools, bowels, and other assorted variegated esoteric nonsense, verily.<br /><br />But Stephen, please, oh please, don't keep spinning this bad gunky; don't make us fools by giving us this gunked-up bool!!  Because, I'm you're biggest fan....
030745455X|4.0|I'm completely surprised at how much I enjoy these books.  There are many twists and turns throughout the novel that make it hard to put it down and get things done around the house.  However, there are some scenes that are slow and the story kind of drags on in places it does not need to--as in going on and on over something that has already been clarified and as you're reading, your brain is screamin \\"I KNOOOOW!!  Get on with the good stuff already!\\"  When the book strays away from Salander I found my mind wandering a bit but all in all, a very good read. I can't wait to get the 3rd book in the trilogy and see how these eccentric characters end up.
0394401522|4.0|An earlier reviewer gave this item one star because they thought the index was useless. The Index in volume two is an index for both volumes.  I believe the previous reviewer misunderstood that.  For example the Mushroom Appetizer recipe they were looking for says \\"I: 202\\" meaning volume 1, page 202.  This may have confused the reviewer but it is not a defect in the book.<br /><br />On another note the book is well bound so it should last for many years of kitchen use.

B003L20IDS|3.0|If I could rate Scott Pilgrim on a 1-to-10 scale, I'd give it a 7.  It's a movie that had a lot of good ideas but ultimately fell short.  As a longtime video gamer, I appreciated the many game references the movie is built on -- with some caveats I'll cover in a moment.  The film is bursting with experimental and fun concepts.  Most of the small ones work, like the labels that pop up on screen next to furniture, people, etc.; and many of the clever little dialog quips (a.k.a. one-liners) were cute.  The mixture of animation with live action was a good thing, especially the spirit animals in the Twins battle.  So there were a lot of things I liked about Scott Pilgrim, but there were problems too.  First, the music wasn't that good.  For such an important element of a movie, it has some pretty ordinary rock songs. I mean, the main character is in a band, and part of the story is set in a Battle of the Bands competition.  Other movies featuring original tunes, such as the otherwise forgettable The Rocker (the one with Rainn Wilson), at least managed to get the music element right, but here it's weak.  Second, after an interesting and cool opening scene, the story goes into about a 10-minute lull where mostly boring stuff is going on.  This slow start had me wondering, \\"so when is the fun stuff going to happen\\"?  A related problem occurs with the ending, which I thought was pretty dopey.  Finally, there's an overly repetitive aspect to the fights with the 7 Evil Exes.  Just too many similar shots of people flying through the air and punching or kicking eachother.  This repetitiveness problem even applies to otherwise fun elements from video games.  By the final battle, I was thinking, \\"oh, it's the Street Fighter guy talking again\\" and \\"oh, the coins are raining down again.\\" Ho hum...  It would have been better if there were maybe 4 Exes instead of 7, I think.  My bottom line on this movie is it was fun, but for me it wasn't the perfect film others seem to have watched.  I hope people actually read my review, but I'm afraid they just came out of the movie only remembering the good parts, and won't make it past my rating -- they'll reflexively hate my review simply because I didn't give 5 stars.  I would ask them - did you actually love the music?  Did you like the ending?  But they'll still vote 'NO' on my review.  Oh well...ed.

She investigates a murder which develops into a series of murders including an attempt on her life. The number of suspects is slightly more than a Scooby-Doo episode, but not by much.<br /><br />The film opens with a Russian plane crash in 1957, then shifts to the present with a gratuitous scene of Kate peeling off layers of clothes to take a shower. However, that is not the \\"some nudity\\" promised in the rating box. It is male streakers. Yup. So don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />In addition to the murders, Kate has to battle the elements as well as frequent annoying Miami flashbacks, explained about midway through the movie. I found Beckinsale unconvincing in her role. In fact all the characters are stiff without any memorable personality traits. Not worth a view. Soundtrack wasn't that good either.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|When I was a kid, heroes were larger than life. They still are today only with just one exception albeit a pretty significant one... in those days, Men were Men. They weren't pretty but they exuded their God-given male born testosterone with every ounce of testicular sweat dripping on celluloid. For a boy growing up in the 80's they were the male role-models and father figures that inspired impressionable pre-adolescent boys into shaping their adult manhoods. Those were the days of yore.<br /><br />The Expendables isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination but it knows exactly what it is trying to be and doesn't pull any punches. It tries to be the [[ASIN:B000BX0VRI The Magnificent Seven]] of the modern action movie but doesn't quite hit its mark. It's more like the Magnificent Four and a Half (Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Austin, and Li). The rest of the ensemble more or less being, ahem... expendable. My friend and I once had a similar idea for a movie that would pit all of our favorite 80's action stars into one no-holds-barred-royal-rumble-of-epic-manliness which we appropriately called \\"Cajones\\" but that was back in the mid-90's when there was still a chance to see most of these larger-than-life-nut-swingers together onscreen in their prime. The fact that Stallone, now 64, can prove that he still has what it takes and show the younger generations how to make an action movie proper after two successful comebacks with his acclaimed [[ASIN:B000N3AXQU Rocky Balboa]] and [[ASIN:B003KV3E36 Rambo ]] is a testament that there is still not only a demand but a primal need for REAL movie star icons like Stallone that are legends who defy their generation and age.<br /><br />There is only one thing you need to know about the paint-by-numbers plot and that is this: These titans of manliness have all come here to chew bubble-gum and kick ass, and there is a whole lotta bubble-gum to go around. When the blood and guts start flying it makes Peckinpah look like Walt Disney. If that is the kind of movie you are expecting to see you won't be disappointed. Perhaps the biggest fault with The Expendables is that it never quite lives up to itself. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo feels like it was thrown in just for the sake of having the three biggest 80's action icons together at last onscreen for a Hard Rock Cafe Kodak moment. It just feels like 'The Guvinator' shows up to give his quick endorsement before going back to the office. Fortunately Sly has much better things to do these days than bankrupting the state of Culifornia. I was never particularly a fan of so-called \\"professional\\" wrestling for all of its phoniness so guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin never really appealed to me but I'll take him and UFC's Randy Couture any day over any so-called leading male action star in Hollywood today just on sheer testosterone levels alone. At least Mickey Rourke showed that not all of professional wrestling is fake with \\"[[ASIN:B001TOD9VI The Wrestler]]\\" but \\"[[ASIN:B0021L8V1Q Iron Man 2]]\\" hardly qualifies him as a bona fide action-star, more like Harley Davidson without the Marlboro Man. One look at his fugly face and you can see that his days of \\"[[ASIN:0792838912 9 1/2 Weeks]]\\" with the ladies are long over. Jason Statham is apparently the most masculine male action star Hollywood currently has to offer up and that's not saying too much with a resume consisting of \\"[[ASIN:B002QZ2DPW Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels ]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000KHX73U Crank]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000ICLRIY The Transporter]]\\" series but I guess baldness apparently qualifies him in the testosterone brigade along with Bruce Willis whose days of headlining as an action star were washed up with the last \\"[[ASIN:B000W4HIY0 Die Hard]].\\" The truly expendable were those 80's action icons who didn't quite make the cut like Chuck Norris who for whatever reason was unable to attend Sly's little shindig. As a kid I probably watched every action film that Chuck starred in like \\"TheOctagon,\\" \\"Good Guys Wear Black,\\" \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\" and \\"A Force of One.\\" You can't think of the 80's without bringing up Chuck Norris, or the poseurs like Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal, all of whom are conspicuously MIA. Apparently Van Dammage was offered a part but he thought the script should have catered to his ego as well as a bigger paycheck so Sly made his part \\"Expendable.\\"<br /><br />The Expendables is a fun salute to the 80's and a throwback to the days when action films weren't trying to be politically correct and were all about blowing stuff up, flexing their muscles, delivering the one-liners, kicking ass and looking cool. To that end, The Expendables is a blast, but not a slam dunk. It's worth a matinee out of pure sake of nostalgia or a rental. If The Expendables accomplishes one thing it should be this: To send a message to the studios that there is a hunger for masculine male action icons who are on the endangered species list and to ensure their survival in the 21st century which has been corrupted by forgettable momma's boys and blood sucking vampires of the Twilight generation.Guys Wear Black,\\" \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\" and \\"A Force of One.\\" You can't think of the 80's without bringing up Chuck Norris, or the poseurs like Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal, all of whom are conspicuously MIA.

B0018O4YSQ|1.0|Blu-ray version only: Proceed with great caution when ordering this disc. When played back through a stereo receiver or TV there is much static/distortion of the audio track. I tried two different discs with the same result. Had to return them both. Fortunately Amazon's customer service is excellent. There are numerous similar comments from other customers here, wish I would have read them before I ordered the movie. It's possible that when played back through a new receiver with the proper decoding that the distortion goes away, but when played through a stereo receiver or TV it's unbearable. I have purchased many, many blu-ray discs and this is the first and only time I have experienced this issue.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not many shows can claim a meager 14 episode run and yet have a large and loyal fan base. So large that they got a movie made, years after the show's demise. And after watching the show in it's entirety I realize for good reason! I'll admit the show does have it's weak spots most notably the camera does seem to be a little to shaky and quick, for lack of a better word, in the early episodes but around \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" the editing and camera team really seems to have found there footing, which is really astounding since it usually takes a show it's entire first season to really found it's comfort zone. The pilot feels like a big budget movie and it introduces us to the main characters in a natural way and a way that we instantly connect with the main characters, the six minute \\"prolouge\\" to the show as a whole which shows the end of the battle of Serenity Valley is a powerful scene both on an action and emotional front. Nathan Fillon is a talented actor and this scene is where he really gets a chance to shine, and he countinues to do so for the rest of the series.  The weakest episodes of the series are \\"The Train Job\\" (although it is followed up on very well in \\"War Stories\\") and \\"Safe\\" which is a mediocre wast of an episode.  The strongest episode of the whole series is \\"Out of Gas\\" which is great from start to finish and has a really fun great twist at the end. Other great episodes are the pilot \\"Serenity\\" and \\"Bushwhacked\\" is another episode with a good twist. \\"Jaynestown\\" is a real fun episode, and \\"Shindig\\" is also fun.   You guys should definetly check out this fun series.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|This is a mini memoir of my listening experience with A7X and a track by track guide to their latest album, Nightmare. This is less of a Nightmare review and more of a review of A7X as a whole.<br /><br />I think like most people, growing up my music tastes were heavily influenced by my father. He would have his Q 104.3 classic rock on every day in the car, not to mention the fact that he is the kind of guy who can listen to the same Ozzy CD for months at a time. So growing up I would love my ozzy, metallica, zeppelin, all that good stuff. But it also left me intolerant of anything that wasn't classic rock. I hated rap, which I still hate for the most part, I hated pop (but that's because its garbage anyway) and for the matter I basically couldn't stand any of the mainstream trash that came out. But I also had a hard time being able to handle any form of hardcore music. As soon as I heard screaming id tell my brother to shut that trash off. Then again he was also a slipknot fan so it wasn't as if he was listening to \\"good\\" hard music.<br /><br />Then I heard something that changed my whole view on metalcore/heavy metal/punk etc. It was sensational guitar work and then the words \\"The wind of life and air from above smells of death/Angels sing of the end/There's nothing you say and nothing you try can change time/Human race prepares to die\\". What beauty.<br /><br />So I knew from there that Avenged Sevenfold were something special. I listened to Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. It took me a little while to get used to the screaming but in the end I thought the album was very good, especially We Come out at Night, Lips of Deceit, Warmness on the Soul, Turn the Other Way, and obviously, To End the Rapture. However it wasn't perfect. I thought the arrangements were all over the place, the vocals were good but not great and the guitar work had something left to be desired. But I respected the fact the guys were still in high school when the album was made and I learned later that Syn Gates' only performance on the album was the song that changed my world; couldn't be a coincidence right? So I was excited to listen to Waking the Fallen.<br /><br />I have always been able to form two words to describe Waking the Fallen: masterpiece and perfection. It was the perfect mixture of every genre of rock. Think Metallica gone Iron Maiden, gone Shadows Fall, gone AFI, gone Slayer, gone Dream Theatre (foreshadowing anyone?). With proper management and proper production in Andrew Murdock the band seemed to take the leap from talented visionaries to true musicians. On this album they produced songs that get your blood flowing like Unholy Confessions, Eternal Rest and Chapter Four, to songs that make you just say \\"Wow\\" like I Won't See You Tonight (especially Part 1), to what's possibly my favorite song ever Second Heartbeat, which to me is simply THE perfect song. I'd since expanded my music tastes but Waking the Fallen solidified my position as a genuine Avenged Sevenfold fan.<br /><br />Being blown away by the greatness of Waking the Fallen I was obviously pumped to get my hands on City of Evil, and after listening to it from beginning to end, I expressed my jubilation with a GREAT BIG... ehh. The album was a huge disappointment. Maybe on its own it can stand as a quality record, and I understand Matt wanted a change, but I'm sorry: you cannot release an album like Waking the Fallen and then abandon everything. At the very least, ease into it; don't forget who you are completely in the matter of 1 album, and what was even worse than their in-studio changes was the fact they stopped performing their old songs (at least the way god intended) live. Changing your music after it was so great is bad enough, but do NOT perform Second Heartbeat without screaming; it's wrong and pathetic, and that's coming from a fan. The one positive that came out of the album was the addition of Johnny Christ, who over time has grown into an extremely talented bassist, and there were good songs including Bat Country, Seize the Day, and MIA.<br /><br />Their self-titled album was still disappointing, but it wasn't as bad as City. It featured to-be-expected good work by Matt, Zacky, Brian, and Jimmy (and featuring a grand return for vocal performing for him) with Johnny Christ really coming into his own as a bassist. Critical Acclaim, Afterlife, Almost Easy, and A Little Piece of Heaven were very good songs. Beyond that, everything was experimental, and there is no reason for that talented a band to experiment, especially the way they did. Branching into other forms of rock is okay, but not hip hop, pop and country; what are you doing? It was still a step up.<br /><br />Buying Live in the LBC/Diamond in the Rough improved my hope. Diamond in the Rough was a good EP, in fact there were a few songs like Crossroads and Demons that had no business not making the self-titled. But it was their live DVD that was fantastic. I always knew they were great live but... shadows screamed. YES! Hope! Real Hope! Although their version of Second Heartbeat was still a little bootlegged, it was a start.<br /><br />So not long after Live in the LBC was released, details about an A7X concept album began circulating around. My one complaint about this is that like the previous 2 albums it seemed that this album would not be truly emotional, just an analysis of the world, because it's not like any band has done that before: besides the Resistance, a step down for Muse (a great band), oh and that disasterpiece 21st century Breakdown, AND Linkin Park's new \\"album\\" (aka my newest Frisbee/drink coaster) and basically every mainstream crap rock album on Earth. I mean, Waking the Fallen had some very emotional moments, especially with the I Won't See You Tonights. I hoped they would have some emotional influence for the record. But, as people say, be careful what you wish for.<br /><br />On December 28 -my birthday of all days- the band lost its greatest musician, Jimmy Sullivan. There have been four times in my life that I have cried: when my dog died when I was like 5, 9-11, my grandmother's passing 6 years ago, and when I heard on the band's official site that Jimmy Sullivan passed. Although it was his own fault (and as human beings nobody, no matter how large or small an A7X fan, should deny that it was his fault) it was a very sad moment, very sad. Happy birthday indeed. Besides being a great musician, he seemed to be a fun and beloved guy, and I will always fondly remember \\"Grapes in the mouth\\", and the size of that F****** duck!<br /><br />Despite the heartbreak that was the Rev's passing, it left me curious about where the band would go and how the Revs idol, the legendary Mike Portnoy would do in his place. Besides Nightmare and Buried Alive, I made the effort to keep myself in the dark about the album. So with a fresh and eager mind, I received the album on its release date and took a listen.<br /><br />Nightmare Track by Track Review<br />Nightmare: 4/5<br />A nice hard hitting song to kick off the album. Eerie intro leads into some absolutely sensational drum work. Vocals are great, guitars awesome.<br /><br />Welcome to the family: 3/5<br />This song has been met with a little criticism. It's catchy but hard hitting at the same time. It is basically a City of Evil paced, MIA-esque song, but it's better than basically better than anything you'll hear on city of evil. Very good song, and although it is pretty clich&eacute;, it will catch you chanting \\"YOU CANT WIN THIS FIGHT!\\" Not their best, not their worst. It is an unmemorable but good song.<br /><br />Danger Line: 3/5<br />It's pretty generic but it's not bad. Most fans treat this as the worst song on the album, I agree. Its message is about the effects of the war on women and children, it's a definite remain from their concept album.<br /><br />Buried Alive: 4/5<br />A great song, very similar to One by Metallica. Starts off slowly and emotionally and escalated big time. Its dark mysterious and it features lyrical screaming by shadows for the first time in a while, unless u count the two seconds of screaming in Crossroads, which I don't because it was an album reject they never perform live. This is definitely a remain of the concept album, but it can definitely be applied to Jimmy, the feeling of being trapped in an unforgiving world.<br /><br />Natural Born Killer: 5/5<br />Fast paced, hard, and all kinds of awesome. It's basically City of Evil on steroids. MP in particular really shines on this. If these arrangements were written by Jimmy it means that he was set to really break through as an elite drummer, and it truly does sound like Jimmy, just Jimmy to the next level. If there is one thing I cannot stress enough, it is that MP was all kinds of perfect being respectful and true to Jimmy.<br /><br />So Far Away: 5/5<br />No we're past what was left of the planned concept album, and we are in to the Jimmy section. It is kicked off with the first song lyrically written by Synyster Gates, who knew Rev longer than anybody else in the band. It starts out simply but powerfully, sort of one man, one guitar and escalates brilliantly at the end, with Shads whipping out one of his most beautiful vocal performances. Although on its own it may not stand as a truly elite song, the lyrics \\"Will you stay?/Will you stay away forever?/... I have so much to say but you're so far away.\\" I could do nothing but wipe a tear and say \\"wow\\".<br /><br />God Hates Us: 78/5<br />No typo, no exaggeration, it's a freaking 78/5! The best song they released in 7 long, grueling years. And it is not all about the screaming (although it has a heck of a lot to do with it). So Far Away puts you in a slow and somber mood and it flows perfectly into the soft intro of this song. Then suddenly you get hit with a wave of intense insanely paced brutal instrumentals. I caught myself thinking \\"how will they manage to blow this opportunity to make a great hard song?\\" but they never blew it. I heard Shadows in Sounding the Seventh Trumpet style scream \\"TOTAL NIGHTMARE\\", and I... well the Lonely Island has a song that explained what happened. Yes that's a lonely Island reference on an A7X review, a nearly impossible feat. It's hard, it's brutal, it never lets up. But it is also meaningful and flat out beautiful.<br /><br />Victim: 5/5<br />Brian took his turn in So Far Away to write beautiful somber lyrics, here is Matt's turn. Matt is referring to Jimmy's passing as a crime that we have all fallen victim to. At the end of the song he repeats the line \\"I'm missing you\\" so emotionally that you begin to reflect on what the band must have gone through throughout this process. I mean this band is not the story of one man deciding he wanted a band and went out recruiting. These are childhood friends. Mat and Jimmy were linked through mutual friend Brian; Zacky was Matt's best friend and the two and Jimmy (briefly) were part of a band called Successful Failure before Avenged Sevenfold; Jimmy and Brian were both in Pinkly Smooth and another member of Pinkly Smooth's (and mutual friend of the band) drug habit was the influence for I Won't See You Tonight. This isn't only a music band, it's a band of brothers and they lost one of their own. It really puts things in perspective. Have you ever heard of a song that can make you think as much as I just did. Well in a few lines, this thing of beauty did just that.<br /><br />Tonight the World Dies: 4/5<br />This is one of the sons that I can't place why I like so much. It's kind of like A Little Piece of Heaven in the sense that it is very different than their other songs yet still very good. Its difference to the rest of their work isn't as profound as A Little Piece of Heaven and it isn't as good as A Little Piece of Heaven, but it is a very good songin its own right. It is a nice mixture of blues and rock, a touching tune about how it is too late to change the things that have happened and how their lives are foREVer changed.<br /><br />Fiction: 5/5<br />If this song was on the self-titled id probably give it a 2/5 but in light of the circumstances and the story behind it, it earns its 5 and then some. This song plays more like a suicide note than a song, boasting dark and beautiful vocals from beyond. \\"Now I think I understand how this world can overcome a man/Like a friend we saw it through/In the end I gave my life for you/... I hope it's worth it, what's left behind me/ I know you'll find your own way, when I'm not with you tonight\\". Coming from the mouth of the Rev himself, this song will likely be implanted in my mind foREVer. Perhaps most fitting of all, this song plays much more like a Pinkly Smooth song than an Avenged Sevenfold song, giving us the feeling that we made a full circle right to the end. This song was called the worst song on the album by multiple critics. Maybe quality wise, but anybody who truly believes this is the worst either doesn't understand the meaning behind it or they flat out don't have souls.<br /><br />Save Me: 5/5<br />At the end of this epic 11 minute song, Matt repeatedly proclaims: \\"Tonight we all die young\\". Avenged Sevenfold was spiritually bound to Jimmy. Avenged sevenfold is a family and those who call themselves fans are part of that family. Part of them and part of us died with James Sullivan: tonight we all have died young. This song is a fantastic send off to Jimmy and a great proclamation of their moving forward without forgetting.<br /><br />Overall (obviously counting God Hates us as 5/5, which doesn't do it justice): 49/55 = 4.45/5<br /><br />A great album, their best by far since Waking the Fallen, which is still their masterpiece. The perfect tribute to Jimmy, and MP did a great job. I only have more respect for him now<br /><br />As of now:<br /><br />1) Waking the Fallen (5/5)<br />2) Nightmare (4/5)<br />3) (Edit 8/27/13) Hail to the King (3.5/5)<br />3) Sounding the Seventh Trumpet (3.5/5)<br />4) Avenged Sevenfold (3/5)<br />5) City of Evil (2.5/5)ig time.

B002ZG98VE|4.0|Most stories revolving around the notorious outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor have a humorous twist and take place during the height of Robin's career as a thief. This time around, however, Ridley Scott takes us back to the origins of the legend...<br /><br />With most of the men in Nottingham off to war on the Crusades with Richard \\"the Lion Heart,\\" their wives and daughters are left to fend for themselves in near-poverty. In the ten years since her husband's departure, Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett) has managed to see her tenants taken care of, in spite of five seasons of lean gathering and oppression both from the government's need for taxes, and the interference of the Church, who requires a large donation annually from the parish. Her husband Robin Loxley meanwhile is making the final push through France with Richard, in the hope of soon returning home. But the French are unwilling to go down without a fight and the monarchy summons an English assassin with ties to their court to put an end to Richard's life. Godfrey (Mark Strong) is well trusted by Richard's younger brother Prince John (Oscar Isaac), and it is believed he can sway John toward unpopular policies, which will divide England and ultimately cause it to fall to foreign invasion.<br /><br />Caught up in the midst of it all is Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), a notable archer who is tired of war and simply wants to return across the channel. When Richard is killed in combat, Robin comes across the assassin and his party and makes a promise to Loxley that he will return Loxley's sword to his father, and tell him of his noble death. Knowing he will not be permitted to travel safely unless he is a knight, Robin and his friends borrow identities and reach the shores of England, where he presents the crown to Eleanor of Aquitaine (Eileen Atkins). Determined to keep his word, Robin then travels to Nottingham, not realizing that this decision will impact the course of his life forever...<br /><br />The critics are panning this and I am not altogether certain why, because it certainly is epic on every level. The director knows his craft in creating sweeping, romantic and often brutal cinematic experiences and this is no different from most of his costume drama projects in that it is glorious to look at, with gorgeous cinematography and excellent performances. Cate and Russell have immediate tension and chemistry, and their romance as it unfolds is both fun to watch and crackles with the promise of future passion. The two bicker and banter and exchange lingering glances and when they finally get around to their first kiss, it is as meaningful as it is tender. The supporting cast is notable as well, with an alternately irritating and likable King John -- at times, we almost feel sorry for him, and then he does something unforgivably pathetic and we retreat into hating him once again. The most glorious villain is Mark Strong, who snarls and grins his way through his scenes, burning houses to the ground, slaughtering anyone who crosses his path, and even stabbing an old blind man through the heart. If that's not a bad guy you can root against, I don't know what is.<br /><br />I suppose some amount of complaining could be launched in the direction this film took, in establishing that Robin is not who other films says he is,  but since I have never particularly liked any of the goofier representations of the character, I for one am not complaining over a massive re-envisioning. If you go into it knowing this is not your traditional Robin Hood, I think you will find it engaging. True, the beginning does jump around a bit in establishing all the different characters and happenings in two separate nations, and Richard is not all that likable, but once Robin arrives in England the pace picks up and Scott's talent as a director gleams particularly in the last half. I liked the nuances of the characters; Robin is of course likable, but Friar Tuck now raises bees (and gleefully sets them on some French soldiers at one point), Little John has a bit of a temper, and Marion has been transformed from a damsel in distress to a feminist icon who can more than look out for herself. There are little moments and instances of humor, but for the most part it is a serious drama.<br /><br />All in all, it's not what you might expect from the tale but is a re-imagining that left me with a smile on my face. It's fun once in awhile to just sit in a theater seat and enjoy the experience, and that ultimately is what can be said of Robin Hood: a few blatant historical inaccuracies aside, it is not meant to be taken too seriously, and in that regard it's just what I love most: a rousing adventure.

0061998494|5.0|It was the title that caught my eye (since I don't find his humor on the show all that funny unless he's in a sketch).  I'm so glad I read this book.  What a decent, good man Craig Ferguson is despite the rough times he lived through.
1603580557|3.0|This book was a hard one to really get interested in.  Things are connected to other things, and the connections are sometimes complicated.  Since I am an ecologist, perhaps this is a bit too obvious.<br /><br />Author Donella Meadows writes well (okay... dry), but Thinking in Systems: A Primer, just doesn't set off any new \\"thinking bells\\" for me.  Look at any problem in only one or two dimensions, and you will have an incomplete picture of what is happening and what can happen.<br /><br />C.S. Holling's note that ecological systems have the characteristics of complexity, uncertainty, and surprise meshes well with Meadows' perspectives.
0671799320|5.0|Daniel Yergin's monster of a book  was completed in 1990, right at the start of the first Gulf War and before the fall of the USSR. That means that you only get to learn about 1859--1989 while reading his 780 pp history of the oil business.<br /><br />This book has been on my \\"to do\\" list for a long time, and I am glad that I read it. I now know a lot more about the oil business (and oil politics!). That knowledge provides useful insights into the the present and gives me some idea of what will happen in the future.<br /><br />I will not give you a long summary of the book. For that, start with wikipedia. The short version of the book is:<br /><br />  1. Americans started the oil industry with lighting; it was run by rough, smart, aggressive characters.<br />  2. Electricity killed the lighting market (kerosene), but the fuel market (diesel and gasoline) took its place.<br />  3. Before WWII, most oil was controlled by US and UK firms that worked all over the world; the US was the biggest producer.<br />  4. Mexico was first to nationalize its oil (breaking contacts with foreign companies) in 1938.<br />  5. Oil was important in WWI, when it helped machines replace horses. It was critical in WWII, when its absence choked the Nazis and a shortage nearly ended Britain's resistance.<br />  6. After WWII, supply outran demand, and prices dropped.<br />  7. Iran (under the Shah) fought with Saudi Arabia for title of biggest exporter. These \\"beggar thy neighbor\\" races for market share hurt everyone, in an echo of the same overpumping that harmed oil US producers in the 1920s.<br />  8. It was not until the 1980s that oil prices were really set in transparent markets; before then, they were set in long-term contracts, in bilateral negotiations that sometimes had nothing to do with economics.<br /><br />In addition to this outline of trends, I made the following notes:<br /><br />  * Water is not even CLOSE to oil in significance for military or political actions. It's VERY unlikely that an army would lose a battle for lack of water or a nation be invaded for its water supplies. That's because water is everywhere, but oil is not.<br />  * There were a lot of VERY smart people in the oil business. Global competition forced the best to the top. No such competition exists in the water world, either in terms of measured talent or productivity nor in terms of the size of the market or incentives to succeed or fail.<br />  * The Office of Price Administration (J.K. Galbraith was on staff and on topic) opposed raising prices in WWII, making it more likely that the US would have fuel shortages and the military would not have enough oil to fight. Vacations to Florida were making it more likely that the Axis would be the owners of Disney World.<br />  * The US was involved in Saudi Arabia from the start, and that involvement meant that the US was not too critical of mistakes or misrule in Saudi.<br />  * The first oil concessions favored capitalist companies. Producing countries then unilaterally rewrote contracts for 50/50 profit splits. New-comers offered more to get into the game. After awhile, most concessions were nationalized.<br />  * Everything changed in 1973, when the Arab -- not OPEC -- embargo against Israeli allies during the Yom Kippur War raised prices to levels never before seen. It's important to note that Small is Beautiful and Limits to Growth were in the public consciousness at the time. With the intellectual background in place, people saw the advantages to using less. It was a total change compared to use more more more...<br /><br />  In the United States, the shortfall struck at fundamental beliefs in the endless abundance of resources, convictions so deeply rooted in the American character and experience that a large part of the public did not even know, up to October 1973, that the United States imported any oil at all. But, in a matter of months, American motorists saw retail gasoline prices climb by 40 percent -- forreasons that they did not understand... The embargo and the shortage it caused were an abrupt break with America's past, and the experience would severely undermine America's confidence in the future. [pp 616-7]<br /><br />  * Oil exploration, production and distribution takes a lot of money, talent and coordination. The oil market was run like a big bureaucracy for many years, but many surprises and mistakes increased the cost of handling complexity. The rise of markets removed a lot of those problems, or at least minimized their harm.<br /><br />This book provides an excellent background to how the oil business grew and changed the world. For more on the (financial, environmental and political) damage that oil causes us today, read Crude World.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I give The Prize five stars for its clear and thorough exposition of an industry that gave us the good life today -- and the industry whose unsustainable product threatens to take that prosperity away.e it caused were an abrupt break with America's past, and the experience would severely undermine America's confidence in the future.

0800141806|5.0|Tom Hanks desevedly won an Oscar for Best Actor in 1994 (his second in a row) as a lawyer dying of AIDS who is fired from his job from a prestigious law firm. He then sues the firm on the basis that he was unjustly fired. The just of the plot deals with what Andrew Beckett(the Hanks character) goes through, everything from homophobia, to his realization that he will die from this dreadful disease, to wanting justice served.<br /><br /> \\"Philadelphia\\" was really the first Hollywood mainstream film to tackle the issues of AIDS, homosexuality, and homophobia dead-on, and the fact that it was a huge hit upon its release in 1993 (the movie grossed over $200,000,000) signifies that audiences were ready for a good story that dealt with these issues.<br /><br /> Tom Hanks' portrayal of Andrew Beckett is probably the best of his career. He even lost weight in real life to show the ravages of AIDS. Gay rights and AIDS activists applauded both Hanks and the filmmakers for creating both a compelling and innovative movie that few have ever forgotten.<br /><br /> Others in the cast also gave extraordinary performances, most notably Denzel Washington who plays the homophobic lawyer Andrew hires in dealing with his case. The supporting roles too were filled with some of Hollywood's best including Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards, and Antonio Banderras who plays Andrew's lover.<br /><br /> Johnathan Demme, most known for his work in 1991's \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" directed this wonderful film, and Bruce Springsteen won an Academy Award for Best Song for \\"The Streets of Philadelphia\\".<br /><br /> The 2 disc DVD set includes deleted scenes.
1593351917|4.0|I might be wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use  is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat his opponents.

B003L20IE2|5.0|First things first, it was Not a cut and paste of the books.  It was as funny, as innovative, as lovable, as heartfelt, and as humble as the books.  My favorite part of the books though, was that they were just really fun. I felt a smile on my face while I read it.  The movie version doesn't lose that.    Some characters are far gayer (weird, I expected to see a red line under that word), and some characters are far less.  Some lost face time and others gained, but I can't think of a single Book-to-Movie edit that was a bad call.  (considering they had to cut about 75% of all character development/back stories)    It feels inappropriate to use the same old words and phrases to praise a movie that was slathered with completely new things I've never seen in a movie or script.  I owe Edgar Wright and Brian Lee O'Malley an attempt though...    -Any one scene from this movie could be viral on YouTube on its own.  -My 'Love the Movie' to 'Hate the Wait til DVD' Ratio is equal at  :   -If there'd been a 15 ft tall facebook \\"Like\\" button at the end of the movie, I would've thrown my full weight against it.  -There were parts were I wanted to ignore the movie just to have something new to watch when I see it again in a few days.  -I'm dude-pregnant with the movie's baby.    This movie easily makes my Top 10.  If you haven't read the books, you'll only understand about 98% of the plot and 96% of the jokes.  I'll save a spolier-laden critique of the movie for at least a week or two after the movie.  What's important now is that you understand how hard this movie does all the undefinable things it does.  Rating: Awesome  (How many reviews will have that in them?  Over/Under: 249.5)    [review taken from [...]]

It explains the Five Love Languages and why a person behaves a certain way when they don't receive their love language.<br /><br />The FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES:<br /><br />1) WORDS OF AFFIRMATIONS<br />2) QUALITY TIME<br />3) RECEIVING GIFTS<br />4) ACTS OF SERVICE<br />5) PHYSICAL TOUCH<br /><br />I noticed that my number one Love Language is ACTS OF SERVICE & my number two is QUALITY TIME.<br /><br />When I receive those two from my Fiance, my love tank is FULL. My heart is happy and I'm filled with so much love for him!!! Don't get me wrong I love him, but when my tank is full I LOVE HIM EVEN MORE!!!!!!<br /><br />If my love tank is empty, I'm not happy, but unlike before....I now know what I need to do to fill it.<br /><br />Had I not found this book, I probably would not have figured out what it took to make me happy.<br /><br />I would definitley recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their relationship or have a better relationship with their partner.<br /><br />It will improve it dramatically!

B001NLKT60|2.0|This one is marginally better than it's predecessor, but it still suffers from a lack of editing and an atrocious translation (either that or the author just doesn't know how to write). It's laughably bad in parts, but the story hangs on by a thread. It passed the time.
B002ZG98M8|5.0|This movie was awesome from start to finish. It wasn't as good as the original, but then what sequels that come years later ever are? It was better than Predator 2 (which had a lot of standstill moments with the main character yelling at people cause they wouldn't let him do his job), and it is much better than the AVP drivel. The acting in this movie was all great. The CGI wasn't overdone. People who say this is too much like the original are wrong. They have some of the same kind of props, like one of the weapons is the same. But the plot and all of the scenes are totally different. I was very impressed by all of the \\"Predator vision\\" shots. People who say the Predators where too easy to kill, unlike the one in the original, need to consider that if they where that tough the humans would die in the first twenty minutes, seeing as there are many more Predators in this one. Compare Alien to Aliens. The Aliens where much easier to kill than the one in the first one. But in this one they did things that where different. Like they where willing to sacrifice themselves to kill the Predators. They never caught the Predator in a direct explosion in the original like they did here. It was always near but not spot on to the Predator in the first movie. I love how brutally tough the Predators where when fighting hand to hand. As an entry to the series I give this a 7.5/10 Conservatively I give this movie an 8/10 Being generous I give it a 10/10
B00386EZJU|5.0|I bought this before I had even seen the movie, because I am a collector of movie scores. I am a fan of John Powell, although I wasn't expecting much from this soundtrack.

While I for the most part enjoyed \\"Eat\\", I gave up during \\"Pray\\", and never made it to \\"Love\\".  I just didn't care.    There was nothing in Gilbert's story to suggest that she deserved any sympathy or feelings of empathy on the part of the reader.  She was living what sounded like a charmed life, took herself out of a fine, if uninspiring, marriage and into a clearly dysfunctional relationship, over which she embarked on a year-long, publisher-funded pity party.    It's a terrible thing to be stranded in the airport, your flight cancelled, and a book you can't finish.  Now that's something to feel bad about!

B003W5C0VM|5.0|I am a follower of the Stones since 1964.  I was 9 years old.  Eight years later, my older brother buys tickets for the Houston 4 pm show.  It would be my first concert.  Five of the fifteen songs in the movie are from this performance.  The Stones had played 2 shows in Fort Worth on Saturday, June 24, 1972, and they played 2 shows the next day at the University of Houston.  All songs are from Beggars Banquet through Exile on Main St., with Bye Bye Johnny thrown in.  Hopefully, they have improved the video for this great movie (the soundtrack has survived in good shape as heard through various bootlegs).  Keith's vocals for Happy were overdubbed & a mess was made of it in the film.  A mystery, because there is a performance on youtube that is not overdubbed.  The vocals are ragged, but it's Keith so who cares?  No inflatable women or bridges to small stages, just a band who is focused on showing how good they really are.  Mick Taylor is a great guitarist and a highlight, but Keith's rhythm guitar work is amazing,  The rhythm section is playing hard,  with a horn section from Texas, the legendary Nicky Hopkins on piano, and the best front man in the business.  I even think it may be Ian Stuart at the piano during Brown Sugar.  Very few shots of the audience, the focus being on the band.  If at least one of these songs don't impress you, you are not a rock fan.  A must see.

The Sun Always Shines on T.V. is a pleasant surprise as it is a different extended mix than I already had. I was surprised they didn't include the extended version of Take On Me, but that is pretty readily available elswhere so no big deal. I almost forgot how wonderful the extended version of Hunting High and Low is! The demos are pretty cool too and interesting to listen to. All in all a great addition to my A-ha collection. Now just \\"25\\" remains. Sorry to see them break up but it has been a tremendous run and I have enjoyed them for 25 long years!!

0061148512|3.0|I read this novel for a psychology class. On the whole, I can't say that I liked the novel very much. The beginning was interesting, and I did enjoy Plath's method of story-telling. But, it got very difficult to read once the novel progressed into the part where she starts to feel depressed. It was slightly disturbing to be in someone's mind who is descending into insanity. I would not recommend this book for the faint of heart.

This is really a must have for any A-ha fan for sure.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was interesting and kept me captivated on what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Jamal (Dev Patel among other actors), a young boy from the slums of India and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal among other actors) sadly lose their mother early to a violent death.  While most of the movie starts from when they are very young, the different scenes show them growing up and fending for themselves on the streets.<br /><br />More of the plot however, centers around Jamal being on the show of India's version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\\"  One question away from winning the grand prize, he is forced into police custody and tortured to see how he is winning (they believe he is cheating).  Instead, he tells them how he knows the answers and in doing so, gives them the story of his life.  Prominently featured in these stories is Latika (Freida Pinto among others) who is a young girl who joins them in their travails after their mother's death.<br /><br />Each question a new part of Jamal's life is uncovered.  Most of it is very brutal; to be sure there are not many happy parts in this movie.  Now as a contestant on this show, his only thought is to get Latika back, which could prove very dangerous.<br /><br />For warning, this movie is very graphic.  It features beatings, murders, and other acts of violence.  Definitely not a good movie for the younger crowd.  It is realistically done though so I could imagine things like this happening.<br /><br />The characters were well played I thought.  Dev Patel especially as Jamal did great at portraying his worry over Latika and his quest to find her.  For some reason the actor who played his brother reminded me of Michael Jackson in his younger years, but it was only mildly distracting from the movie.  All the other characters seemed authentic enough as well.  The only character that wasn't truly amazing to me was the older Latika, while she was quite beautiful, there wasn't a lot of depth that went into her character like there was for the rest of them.<br /><br />The music in this movie was fantastic.  It was a mix of Indian/English so while a non-Indian dialect speaker might not be able to understand some of the lyrics, there were some that could be understood.  They had great rhythm and fit the flow of the story nicely.<br /><br />Overall a great movie.  There was a lot of action but enough story to keep you engaged in the characters.  I truly cared about how the ending would turn out and was pleasantly surprised and equally as shocked at the results.  I can see why it won so many awards.the rest of them.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|Mythic Greece: After being found drifting in a coffin at sea and saved from a watery grave as an infant by his adoptive father (Pete Postlethwaite), Perseus (Sam Worthington), grows to manhood and ekes out a simple but happy existence as a fisherman on the Greek straits with his adopted family. But storm clouds gather inexorably on the horizon; the Kingdom of Argos, infuriated by the cruel indifferences and vicissitudes of the Gods, has declared war on the omnipotent rulers of Mount Olympus themselves. Almighty Zeus (Liam Neeson), angered by the impudence of his creations, unleashes his banished brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) upon the face of the Earth in order to teach them a lesson. Perseus' family are amongst the first casualties of Hades' slaughter and, driven by inconsolable rage, he resolves to destroy the very ruler of the underworld himself...    \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" is a splendid remake of a very silly but fun film. Because, let's be honest, as enjoyable as the original was, it was never a classic - not even at the time of it's release (which I remember very clearly). The original was a giant cheese football of a movie and this film is also a giant cheese football of a movie; the thing that they both have in common is that they're both completely enjoyable, largely because neither one takes itself very seriously at all.    Like most of the best remakes, \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" reworks the concept of it's progenitor in order to go somewhere a little bit different. This film is a little darker than the original and, in a suitably Ouroborosian twist, has clearly been influenced by [[ASIN:B002NN7AKU God of War: Collection]] (an excellent PS2 game which was itself very clearly influenced by the original \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" - to the point that Harry Hamlin, the actor who played the original Perseus, voiced a character in \\"God Of War 2\\"). But while this film may favour a slightly darker tone, director Louis Leterrier  (who also made the fiendishly enjoyable [[ASIN:B001DHXT20 The Incredible Hulk (Widescreen Edition)]] with Ed Norton) knows what made the original work and, CGI effects aside, keeps this film very much in the style of camp eighties fantasy movies like [[ASIN:B000056WR3 Krull]], [[ASIN:B00005Q4D7 The Beastmaster]] and [[ASIN:0783241895 Conan the Barbarian - Collector's Edition]] whilst throwing in some very subversive humour and the odd nod to the original (the brief cameo from Bubo, the rather naff clockwork Owl from the original, had me in fits of laughter, largely due to the way it was played).     Personally, I think \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" stands head and shoulders over most of the bilge that has filled our cinemas lately. Sam Worthington makes a doggedly rugged Perseus; the rest of the cast (including Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Vincent Regan, Polly Walker and the gorgeous Gemma Arterton) all do a cracking job and clearly have fun doing it; Liam Neeson wanders around in a silly beard and armour; Ralph Fiennes throws in a combination impersonation of Terence Stamp in \\"Superman 2\\", Nicol Williamson in \\"Excalibur\\" and Richard Harris in \\"Gladiator\\" and the film as a whole is generally just a good, all-round, old-fashioned fantasy romp which doesn't take itself at all seriously and is over in under two hours.     Frankly I really have no idea why this remake engendered so much hatred at the time of it's release and I genuinely don't know what's going on with audiences these days. They shower praise on simplistic, portentous drek such as \\"Avatar\\" like it's a rediscovered Tolstoy novel, yet they can't enjoy a good, old-fashioned fantasy flick which plays fast and loose with Greek mythology (in a deeply amusing manner) and which is merely the latest in a long line of films in which men in sandals and silly beards kick seven shades of what-the-horse-drops out of animated monsters.    Myself personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and would love to see a sequel.     Engage with it on the level onwhich it's intended and I suspect you'll have fun with it too.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|I recall exactly how I felt right after I completed watching the first season of Lost.  I knew without a doubt that I had just watched the BEST show on network television EVER.  Needless to say I was a true, die-hard FANATIC of the show (especially for the first two seasons).  I was completely in love with this show and preached LOST to everyone I know because I followed it religiously.  The mystery, drama, action, suspense, story, acting, characters, plot-twists, flow, were all more than superb.  Every single episode I tried to find mistakes, I tried to find something that the writers did wrong and I couldn't find it; everything was just PERFECT and nothing made me happier.<br /><br />That perfection was destroyed in Season 6.  Everything that had made this show the marvel that it was had been replaced with the nonsense and disgrace that is Season 6.  After watching the final episode, I literally felt like throwing my HDTV out the window never to watch it again.  Words cannot express the pure hatred I feel towards this final season and its finale.  Plain and simple it's PURE, STINKIN' GARBAGE.  Every relevant and deep mystery remained exactly that.  Absolutely nothing crucial was ever answered.  Even worse, MORE mysteries were introuduced in season 6 that weren't even going to be answered by its conclusion.  I mean really, THE FANS OF LOST COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SEASON THAN THIS.  Thanks to these writers,  I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER NETWORK TV SERIES EVER AGAIN.  If LOST was not able to fulfill its own promise, no other show ever will.  I have completely LOST my faith in all network television.  I will NEVER AGAIN be tricked into watching year after year only to be completely dissapointed.  No amount of clever marketing, word-of-mouth, critical acclaim will ever change my position.  Thank God HBO is still around because it's about the only thing I'll continue to watch for the time being.
B002ZG980U|5.0|So many people hate what they don't understand. Unfortunately for them, they missed out on an amazing film. Inception is a well-layered, emotionally laced story about understanding oneself and recognizing that fleeting moment when your mind creates and perceives at the same time. Heavy stuff. Not what you'd expect from a cool-looking, sci-fi heist movie, right? Exactly. It's not what you'll expect, and that's why this movie is such a great film. Watch it again and again and you'll reveal even more than you've seen on previous viewings. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself, and raised the bar for filmmaking. Summer movies should always be this stimulating and fun. You can read my review of Inception at my blog on word press if you like. It's my full name dot word press dot com.
0545123283|4.0|It seems a long time ago now that I first read [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]]--the first book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. But looking back I started it on the plane ride to BEA and finished it there in the conference center, fingers gripping the cover tightly, while sitting on the floor in one of the many autograph lines. And then suddenly it's May again and and I emerge from my recent and nasty reading slump stupor to find a copy of LINGER sitting in my mailbox like a glove thrown down in the dirt. \\"I will be the one to pull you out,\\" it whispers to me slyly. \\"Just open me up and take a sip. I promise--one sip is all it will take.\\" And I look at it with fear and longing written all over my face. \\"You promise?\\" I ask intently. \\"Because it's been a long walk in the cold and I'm not sure I can take another disappointment.\\" \\"Just open me up,\\" it says, confidence written all over its cover. And so I do. And everything else falls away.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are trying to take up the reins of their lives again after the cataclysmic events of the previous winter. Sam is human. Despite the lingering cold as spring grows ever closer, he will not be changing into a wolf. Whatever it was that caused it has been seemingly eradicated and suddenly he has an entire lifetime stretching out ahead of him. And Grace is all set to share that life with him, to make plans, to pick colleges, to get away from her disapproving parents as soon as possible. But their cautious attempts to move forward are curtailed when a new wolf arrives in town--the fruits of Beck's final act as pack protector. It's immediately clear that something is very off about Cole, but Sam can't quite put his finger on what. And he doesn't have much time to dedicate to figuring out his new charge (of sorts) as Grace is fighting her own battle with a nameless threat and it feels like she's drifting farther and farther away with every day. Meanwhile, Isabel is thrashing around the way only Isabel can. Unable to come to terms with her brother's death and certain as certain that Sam and Grace are unwittingly headed for disaster, Isabel finds herself playing the voice of reason. And as she seems to literally run across Cole at every turn, these interactions push her closer and closer to finding out his secret and the real explanation behind Grace's strained smiles and uneasy silences.<br /><br />I was somewhat concerned about reading LINGER. It was definitely not the writing that concerned me, because I adore Maggie Stiefvater's elegant prose. And it was not the characters, because any time spent with Sam and Grace (and Isabel) is time well spent. But I loved how [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]] ended. It was perfect. And I wondered where exactly things could go from there, you know? What direction their story could take that wouldn't feel forced. With so many series lately, it feels like they're being kept alive on life support. And I was worried about the fragile beauty of where things ended and having that peace ruined. But I should have known better. I should have had more faith. From here on out there will be no doubt. There will be no fear. Because LINGER is that most rare and wonderful of books--an absolutely gorgeous, riveting sequel. It made good on all its promises. I was sucked out of the slump I was in within the handful of seconds it took me to read the first page. There are so many things to love about this book. But I have to mention, first and foremost, the writing. It washes over you in waves of lyrical longing and puts other, lesser storytelling to shame. A favorite passage early on:<br /><br />***<br /><br />*Sam*<br /><br />Later, I thought of the things I could have added to the list of resolutions, things I'd wanted back before I realized what being a wolf meant for my future. Things like Write a novel and Find a band and Get a degree in obscure poetry in translation and Travel the world. It felt indulgent and fanciful to be considering those things now afterreminding myself for so long that they were impossible.<br /><br />I tried to imagine myself filling out a college application. Writing a synopsis. Tacking a sign saying DRUMMERS WANTED on the corkboard opposite Beck's post office box. The words danced in my head, dazzling in their sudden nearness. I wanted to add them to my index card of resolutions, but I just . . . couldn't.<br /><br />That night, while Grace showered, I got out the card and looked at it again. And I wrote:<br /><br />Believe in my cure.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I actually felt lighter the further I read, despite the gravity and sense of impending doom that pervades the text. But it is so unbelievably refreshing to be buoyed up by the astonishing turns of phrase rather than bogged down by lackluster wordsmithing. I would read Maggie Stiefvater's cereal box copy. But happily, I shall never be forced to do so as her characters and plot lines are both sympathetic and nuanced. The woman positively excels at young male protagonists. Like James in [[ASIN:0738714844 Ballad: A Gathering of Faerie]], Sam is so very endearing, if in a much less angsty and overt way. His breathtaking blend of maturity and vulnerability tugs at my heartstrings and the strength of his relationship with Grace is true and unswerving. I'm also delighted to report that the supporting characters Isabel and Cole are no less outstanding. In fact, I may have been most captivated by Cole's sections, as the narrative is split between the four of them. His depth of damage mixed with the faintest glimmer of hope enriched the whole for me and I loved watching the four so distinct threads weave together by the inevitable climax. I was consumed by LINGER, loved it even more than its predecessor, and am positively thrumming with excitement for Forever--the final installment in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.<br /><br />Reading order: [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]], LINGERhey were impossible.

If you take her expensive seminar, you will be asked to sign a contract at the end of it to teach Theta Healing exactly has Viana prescibes or be threatened with legal action.

0061474355|4.0|Garth Nix is a familiar name in the fantasy world and I first encountered him through the wonderful SABRIEL. Nix is a member of that amazing and fast-growing collection of Australian young adult authors and one I would love to meet as his worlds are so expansive and well-thought-out. It would be fun to pick his brain about the creation process. This was another of those golden selections for my old Young Adult Reading Group and we had so many wonderful conversations surrounding the intricate and grim world Nix created and the memorable characters he populated it with. This is the first book in the Abhorsen trilogy, also known as the Old Kingdom series, and when I first read it only the first two books were out. This gave me time, however, to convince my husband he needed to read it as well and so we read it aloud together--another of those wonderful reading memories I cherish. He liked it just as much as I did. I don't hear it talked about as much these days, though. I ran across a couple of reviews of it recently that brought the story back to the forefront of my mind and reminded me why I loved it so the first time I read it several years ago. I'm also curious as to how many of you others out there have read it and what you thought.<br /><br />It all starts with the death of a small white rabbit. On the verge of finishing school at Wyverly College, 18-year-old Sabriel is a solid student and a respected prefect. She can also raise the dead. And after raising the rabbit to please a fellow student, she receives an unnerving message from her father. Certain he is in mortal danger, Sabriel arms herself with the sword he sent her and his bandolier of bells--the tools of the trade of a true necromancer. For that is what her father the Abhorsen is. Though rather than bring the dead back to life, he puts them back to rest once more or binds them if rest is impossible. Trained by her father, Sabriel knows he must be stuck in the land of the dead itself. So she chooses to leave school entirely, travel several miles to the wall that separates unmagical Ancelstierre from the wild Old Kingdom, and crosses over to search out her father and free him from whatever evil holds him captive. Used to being on her own, Sabriel is surprised to encounter companions along the way. The mysterious Mogget, who inhabits the form of a cat, but who is something much older and powerful than that. The unusual young man, frozen in time as the figurehead of a ship, who can no longer remember his name and goes by the name the mercurial Mogget gives him--Touchstone. Together the three of them forge ahead through the rivers and hallways and fountains of Death.<br /><br />You have never ready anything quite like SABRIEL before. I certainly hadn't, the first time I picked it up. Due to the nature of Sabriel's heritage and her father's morbid occupation, a chilly sense of doom pervades the entire tale. And yet. Sabriel herself is a wonderfully self-possessed young woman and, while she is versed in the darker arts, she is also refreshingly clear-eyed and kind. I was immediately charmed by her and amused at the acerbic and, at times, funny relationship between her and Mogget. The world itself is amazingly complex, featuring several forms of magic as well as an interlocking system of rules that governs its use, by both the living and the dead. Nix's writing is fast-moving and assured and you can almost hear the deep ringing of the bells as Sabriel rings them, reining in gruesome shades, forcing them to sleep, to weep, to abide by her will. Here's an example of what I'm talking about:<br /><br />***<br /><br />Finally, they came to a large chamber, with a set of double doors to one side. Light leaked in from a large number of small, circular holes in the roof, or as Sabriel soon saw, through an overgrown lattice that had once been open air and sky.<br /><br />\\"That's the outside door,\\" Touchstone said, unnecessarily. He snuffed out his candle, took Sabriel's, now littlemore than a stub of wax, and put both in a pocket stitched to the front of his kilt. Sabriel thought of joking about the hot wax and the potential for damage, but thought better of it. Touchstone was not the lighthearted type.<br /><br />\\"How does it open?\\" asked Sabriel, indicating the door. She couldn't see any handle, lock or key. Or any hinges, for that matter.<br /><br />Touchstone was silent, eyes unfocused and staring, then he laughed, a bitter little chuckle.<br /><br />\\"I don't remember! All the way up the stair, all the words and signals . . . and now useless. Useless!\\"<br /><br />\\"At least you got us up the steps,\\" Sabriel pointed out, alarmed by the violence of his self-loathing. \\"I'd still be sitting by the spring, watching it bubble, if you hadn't come along.\\"<br /><br />\\"You would have found the way out,\\" Touchstone muttered. \\"Or Mogget would. Wood! Yes, that's what I deserve to be--\\"<br /><br />\\"Touchstone,\\" Mogget interrupted, hissing. \\"Shut up. You're to be useful, remember?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes,\\" replied Touchstone, visibly calming his breathing, composing his face. \\"I'm sorry, Mogget. Milady.\\"<br /><br />\\"Please, please, just Sabriel,\\" she said tiredly. \\"I've only just left school--I\\"m only eighteen! Calling me milady seems ridiculous.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sabriel,\\" Touchstone said tentatively. \\"I will try to remember. 'Milady' is a habit . . . it reminds me of my place in the world. It's easier for me--\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't care what's easier for you!\\" Sabriel snapped. \\"Don't call me milady and stop acting like a halfwit! Just be yourself. Behave normally. I don't need a valet, I need a useful . . . friend!\\"<br /><br />\\"Very well, Sabriel,\\" Touchstone said, with careful emphasis. He was angry now, but at least that was an improvement over servile, Sabriel thought.<br /><br />\\"Now,\\" she said to the smirking Mogget. \\"Have you got any ideas about this door?\\"<br /><br />\\"Just one,\\" replied Mogget, sliding between her legs and over to the thin line that marked the division between the two leaves of the door. \\"Push. One on each side.\\"<br /><br />\\"Push?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why not?\\" said Touchstone, shrugging. He took up a position, braced against the left side of the door, palms flat on the metal-studded wood. Sabriel hesitated, then did the same against the right.<br /><br />\\"One, two, three, push!\\" announced Mogget.<br /><br />Sabriel pushed on \\"three\\" and Touchstone on \\"push,\\" so their combined effort took several seconds to synchronize. Then the doors creaked slowly open, sunshine spilling through in a bright bar, climbing from floor to ceiling, dust motes dancing in its progress.<br /><br />\\"It feels strange,\\" said Touchstone, the wood humming beneath his hands like plucked lute strings.<br /><br />\\"I can hear voices,\\" exclaimed Sabriel at the same time, her ears full of half-caught words, laughter, distant singing.<br /><br />\\"I can see time,\\" whispered Mogget, so softly that his words were lost.<br /><br />***<br /><br />That last line gives me shivers every time I read it. As does the entire book, really. Sabriel is the kind of heroine you dream of, amid so many lackluster and weak-willed leading ladies, she stands out like the clear, pure pealing of one of her father's bells.

0618871713|5.0|Picked this up by chance and found one of the best books I have ever read. The writer really is thoughtful which gives the book depth.  The book is a facinating story of an incredibly talented family living in a small town where the family lived for generations. An amazing American story.  I would love to see this on high school reading lists too because it is a coming of age book.  Don't shunt this aside on the LGBT section, it is a univerasally appealing story.

It should not just be a Halloween book and it is a shame that some words have been changed for the American market.

It is good for kids to be exposed to language as well as the original charm of the story.
B0012GMXYM|3.0|I for one will admit as a musician I was totally caught up in the fusion \\"revolution\\" of the seventies and this album/CD is product of that era. Santana was a devotee of guitarist, John McLaughlin and his religious beliefs during this time period and really jumped into the deep end of the pool with really only marginal \\"swimming\\" skills. What we got was Santana trying desperately to be one of the pioneers of fusion with this record and its predecessor, \\"Welcome\\". While he assembled a great bunch of players and singers the end products were short on any really memorable material and what seemed cool at the time now sounds really dated and contrived. While I applaud Carlos' attempts to lure his fans to more esoteric music he really was in over his head and a lot of this material is just really long jams. He returned to his original Latin-rock formula on his subsequent records as I am sure his record company was getting ready to renegotiate his contract after a number of financial and musical failures. I'll give the song \\"Mirage\\" a B if only for sentimental reasons.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is an engaging writer.  I perhaps enjoyed best his vignettes from the 1996 campaign trail published in The New Republic.  He has the ability to cut through fog of a wide spectrum of modern life and write in a way which seems to get to the truth of many matters.  I found The Big Short to be no exception.  Although I had followed the financial pages throughout the crisis, many of the details then were hard for me to fathom.  Lewis gave me a much better idea and did so in an entertaining way.
B0014G5LG2|3.0|There's a statement at p. 3 in the accompanying booklet that says quite a lot about this recording. Here we read the following judgement about Mahler's 10: \\"a lot less weird than the Seventh\\". Who said it? - Well, \\"some players\\" of Vienna Philharmonic responding to Mr Harding's question about their initial response to this music. Apparently many of the players held that view. And that says a lot about Vienna Philharmonic's relation to Mahler: the orchestra's tradition is simply that they do not understand/appreciate his music as much as is needed for a good interpretation. And, apparently, Mr Harding has not managed to convince them of anything else than that this music is just \\"a lot less weird than the Seventh\\".<br /><br />What about the interpretation, then? I found no special insights in Mr Harding's approach. It is, of course, not a bad or terrible interpretation, but, as I see it, just a \\"via media\\" (i.e., middle of the road) interpretation that carefully avoids extremes. It is also quite slow, at least if you compare with Ormandy's outstanding premiere recording of Cooke's performing version: [[ASIN:B000F6YW1M Mahler: Symphony No. 10 [Performing Version by Deryck Cooke]]].<br /><br />Everything is of course beautifully played (because Vienna Philharmonic is a great orchestra in terms of sound), but there's no passion anywhere. Not the passion that this orchestra manages to show when they play Vienna walzes during the New Year concerts, at least (perhaps that is what they prefer to do at every concert...). Or perhaps is it Mr Harding's limited experience as a Mahler interpreter that prevents him from reaching the rock bottom of the score - as I think Gielen, Rattle and even Chailly did in their recordings (see [[ASIN:B000CQM4NS Mahler: Symphony No. 10 (Performing Version by Deryck Cooke)]], [[ASIN:B00004RITP Mahler - Symphony 10 / Berliner Philharmoniker * Rattle]] and [[ASIN:B00004T769 Mahler: Symphony no 10 / Chailly, RSO Berlin]]). After all, the man is just 32 here. And he has not yet recorded Mahler's first symphony, just the fourth in a somewhat weird (!) version for chamber orchestra: [[ASIN:B00065VU5I Mahler: Symphony No. 4]].<br /><br />In sum, Ormandy's recording is still the first choice, followed by Gielen in outstanding digital sound. Rattle and Chailly come next. And then we have Barshai in his own version of the Mahler 10, now available as a single bargain disc: [[ASIN:B003E1QDH6 Symphony 10]].he has not yet recorded Mahler's first symphony, just the fourth in a somewhat weird (!) version for chamber orchestra: [[ASIN:B00065VU5I Mahler: Symphony No. 4]].

And then we have Barshai in his own version of the Mahler 10, now available as a single bargain disc: [[ASIN:B003E1QDH6 Symphony 10]].
B001CVCB9O|5.0|I made the mistake of judging Calexico on their Garden Ruin album which to me was dull and except for a few tunes like Roka, Lucky Dime and Nom de Plume, completely forgettable. But boredom and a trip to the library prompted me to give Carried to Dust a listen. Wow. I am buying this cd immediately! I wanted to hit repeat after every single track. Calexico blends a number of musical influences superbly on this cd- from latin sounds to country/blues to moody folk alternative vibes. It's the alternative feel that holds me as latin or country by themselves just don't do it for me. Normally I can pick a few favorites tunes to recommend but that's particularly tough here. I guess I'd say check out Victor Jara's Hands and Two Silver Trees if you want a good snapshot of what to expect on the album, but as to best cuts, it's a toss up! All I can say is if you're hungry for some killer tunes, BUY THIS ALBUM! You'll find an audio feast here!
B00003CXRM|4.0|The Coen Brothers bring us a unique and humorous retelling of the Odyssey in O Brother Where Art Thou ? Instead of the mythologized characters made famous in the Odyssey the monsters are human most notably the one eyed bible salesmen played by John Goodman acting as a human Cyclopes and the unscrupulous man who tried to steal Ulysses family from him. In order to regain his family, Ulysses must battle both the human monsters of the modern world and the monsters contained in nature still exist between floods and intense rains. Throughout the journey home, the escaped group of convicts encounter obstacles that nod toward the historical roots of The Odyssey from the previously mentioned Cyclopes to the Sirens...a group of very attractive women who hypnotize one of the prisoners leaving him without clothes. Overall an engaging, entertaining, and comedic adaptation of a literary classic.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Well made movie with a well known cast.  Husband had to have it after watching it on tv but with commercials.  In order to see it unedited had to buy it.
B003KVNV4S|4.0|I had never really heard to much from The National. I just saw them advertised on TV and Amazon,so I decided to get their album. I thought they were going to sound a little cliche(as far as their sound). I was a little right, but I still enjoyed the CD. It's got a nice mellow mood to it. This album isn't too awfully long,but most of the tracks are good. Blood buzz Ohio reminded me a little bit of a David bowie type sound. Which I really liked. I also enjoyed the track Sorrow, it's got a very cool industrial beat to it. It reminds me of some of the stuff U2's done in the past. Overall, I think this is a great CD and should not be overlooked by music fans especially if you like Fleet Foxes or Rogue Wave.
0061537969|5.0|This may be the greatest book I have ever read.  It is wonderfully written.  I felt like I was there, in the story.  I went through all the emotions while reading this book.  I was happy, sad, angry with Eve's parents, and felt both happiness and sadness with the ending.  I have a cat but always liked dogs too.  I think this is a great book for everyone, not just pet owners, because it is a magnificent story of life.  We humans could lean a lot from Enzo.  If we lived our lives like Enzo would if he was human the world would be a better place!
B003O85W3A|5.0|I have been waiting so patiently.  I love love love it.  When Neon Bible was released, it took a few listens to appreciate it as much as Funeral.  Same here, I thought when I very first heard it, it could never live up to my expectations.  But after spending some commuting time alone with The Suburbs, I'm hooked.  Mmm, so good.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker season two is excellent! This show never disappoints. Just like season one, season two combines fantasy, action, adventure, comedy, drama, science fiction and romance in the ever beautiful New Zealand! The acting in season two gets better and better, as the main characters really seem to develop and have an affect on each other during their perilous journeys. Season two gives you a taste of what you want to see (especially the evolving relationship between Kahlan and Richard) without giving it all. I highly recommend this show to anyone- not just fantasy/science fiction fans.    Legend of the Seeker has so far not been renewed for a third season, but Seeker fans have been working hard to get network attention in their quest to see the show go on. As the Legend of the Seeker is based on Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, there are plenty of stories left to be told in future seasons.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|This is a great introduction / overview of the music of the Gipsy Kings.  If you like this disk, you will want to consider looking further into their work.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I revisited this film after many years. It's a fun thing to do when you see actors that you might not have known at the time but went on to have good careers. This did not disappoint. It's loaded with lots of names and faces you've come to recognize over the years.     This is pretty straight forward both in the story and the way it's told. The Memphis Belle was the first bomber in WWII to achieve 25 missions without being shot down which gave their crew a free ticket home. This is the story of the 25th mission. As in any number of other military movies, the first part is meeting those involved, particularly the crew. Then you head onto the mission itself.     It's a pretty thrilling ride. You get to know enough about each of the crew members to care what happens to them when things hit the fan. The dog fights between the single pilot fighters are OK, (nothing to write home about) and the attacks on the bombers themselves have some pretty cool moments. Some of the dialogue during the flight isn't really very good but you're with these guys in their plight so you hang in with them and worry for them as certain circumstances arise.    I don't know how many of the details are true or if there is a liberal sprinkling of Hollywood thrown in, but they keep you going up to the final moment.     This is not good art but it's good craft. Sit back with the pizza and beer and have a good time.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is an absolutely amazing show! It combines fantasy, action, comedy, drama, romance, and science fiction into one! Every episode is unique, so you won't get bored with the same formula over and over again. After watching both seasons, I do think that the first one or two episodes of season one are a bit \\"wobbly\\", as another reviewer pointed out, especially regarding the acting. However, soon the actors really hit their stride- the chemistry between Craig Horner and Bridget Regan becomes total magic! I definitely recommend season one to anyone- not just fantasy fans!
B0037W68F4|5.0|To me, MGMT was always two bands trapped inside one. You can clearly hear this through Oracular Spectacular. On the one hand there is a band that likes to be upbeat and give you dancy tunes with a pop sensibility. Then there's the other half of the album, where the band gets into psychedelia and prog rock. Both of them are MGMT and both sounds are great and work well on their debut. Congratulations is an extension of the sound they explored on their first album but a more cohesive one. The sound was already there on songs like \\"The Handshake\\". But based on some of the negative reviews, it may feel like it came from left field.    I'm glad these guys put out the album they did because as a complete album from start to finish, it works very well. There is still some pop here (Song for Dan Treacy, Flash Delirium, Brian Eno) but it's more in the vein of twee and 60s pop with an injection of psych. But it's true, this album will take time to appreciate and love since the bulk is more subdued and slow. I can't blame fans for looking for another \\"Kids\\" or \\"Electric Feel\\". Afterall, they set up that expectation  with their first album. So you have to divorce yourself of those expectations and appreciate Congratulations for what it is, not bash it for what it isn't.     Maybe MGMT are even, on some level, acting as music curators on this album by exposing some of those fans that are just looking for the next dance hit to music they may not have heard otherwise. Maybe they'll seek out info on the music that influenced MGMT and find beauty in what Congrats pays homage to. Just maybe a new generation of people will discover Music for Airports and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Just like Lady Gaga got her fans exploring The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
0425206211|5.0|I decided to try this author, and start at the beginning of the series.  What a find!  Jack Reacher is a great protagonist -he can get all the bad guys, singlehandedly.  The first in the series - Killing Floor - was a great adventure, and a can't-put-down read.  This book, 2nd in the series - Die Trying - is just as great.  This is an author to watch.  I'm on the fourth book of the series now and have loved them all.  Really enjoy the main character - that Jack Reacher can do it all! I recommend this book, and the entire series, to everyone who loves action thrillers with a strong lead character who doesn't hesitate to right any wrong, by good means or bad.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|First the movie was dark, and a lot of fun for any batman fan to watch.   I'm a big Kevin Conroy fan, so I was skeptical about the voice acting, but BRUCE GREENWOOD is Awesome and worthy of being Batman.  I was really impressed with his performance.   Jensen Ackles was good too.  I hated the Joker voice in this.  It was too distracting and I felt like Lex Luthor was playing the joker.  Not cool.  Thankfully the Joker is only in it briefly (I really missed Mark Hamill here), and the rest of the film was really fun to watch.  The Joker was supposed to be a darker portrayal, but the voice just didn't work for me. It was too distracting and took away from the film.  Other than that get this and enjoy the ride.  Did I mention Bruce Greenwood was great!  He should voice over Christian Bale in the next batman movie.
006079383X|5.0|As a few have mentioned this audio book goes great with having also read the book.  It is a good way to reinforce some of the concepts while you are stuck in traffic with nothing better to do.  For those who say this audio book is outdated, then I think they just don't \\"get it\\".  An observation by Buffett that I've heard him say numerous times, either the principles will click instantly with someone or they just will never get it. The principles are very sound and although it's from the early 1970s edition, some of the observations made in that edition show just how timeless the concepts truly are.  For example it is mentioned numerous time at current DJIA levels in 1972 they had no enthusiasm for stocks at current levels.  1973-1974 bear market saw the market drop roughly 45%!  This audio book is about basic concepts and not a magic bullet with a precise formula for success.  It is a matter for one to understand those concepts and how to apply them.  For those looking for something more than that fundamental concepts to invest successfully, look elsewhere (perhaps Jim Cramer has some advise for the week. LOL).    As I have followed the principles I have not completely, but missed the majority of the declines in the early 2000s, 2008-2009 bear market. This has allowed me to handsomely beat the S&P500 over the past 14 years.
0891419063|5.0|With the Old Breed - At Peleliu and Okinawa, by E. B. Sledge, 2nd Edition ed. Novato, California: Presidio Press, 1981.<br />Started Section: May 14, 2006<br />Finished Section: May 15, 2006<br /><br /> With the Old Breed - At Peleliu and Okinawa by E. B. Sledge is a very important book at many different levels.  It is like the Bible, there are lessons and messages throughout that speak to the past, the present, and to the future.  It can be used to explain or support almost any argument that deals with human conflict and why men fight, have fought, and will probably continue to fight.<br /> First, it is amazing that the book ever written.  Most combat veterans from the major wars in the 20th Century, especially at the level of those on the front line, have refrained from telling about what combat was really like to those who did not share the experience.  Civil War veterans were more likely to write and share their experiences than those of WWI and WWII.<br /> Historians and the public are most used to get their information on how life was like on the front line from novels which were based on real or imagined experience.  These novels really did not deal with the minute by minute, hour by hour, day to day life and death on the front lines.  Sledge deals with the reality of going to the john during combat:<br />Added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides was the repulsive odor of human excrement everywhere.  It was all but impossible to practice simple, elemental field sanitation on most areas of Peleliu because of the rocky surface.  Field sanitation during ... combat was the responsibility of each man.  In short, under normal conditions, he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil.  At night when he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole, he simply used an empty grenade canister or ration can, threw it outside of his hole, and scooped dirt over it next day if he wasn't under heavy enemy fire.<br /> This book is the bottom up view of war.  This memoir deals with group and individual survival, not grand strategy and the interaction of many players.  Sledge is vaguely aware of things that are happening while he was on active duty but the prime mission of Sledge and front line fighters for eternity is to come back alive with as many of your friends as possible.  The corollary of this is that you have to either destroy your adversaries or achieve what is preferable, their surrender as quickly as possible.<br /> War in the Pacific was almost entirely new to the American fighting man and American public.  Americans had no real experience in fighting on this scale before against non Europeans.  The closest thing that they had experienced and it was not well known was in fighting Philippine insurgents who wanted their independence at the end of the Spanish American War.  The American Indian was different of course but the memory of fighting them was fading and the fighting had not been on the scale of World War II in the Pacific.  Many historians and people use Sledge to show how prevalent racism was in our fighting the Japs, a word that will remain with all of those who participated or experienced this war from afar.  The Japanese are those people with whom we now share common goals and aspirations because our cultures are much closer now than they were during World War II.<br /> This author does not see the alleged racism in our fighting the Japanese/Japs in World War II.  I see something that goes much further back into the history of warfare which is the desire of the fighting man to have to fight as little as possible, a condition that minimizes the loss of life on both sides.  The preference of the \\"ritual\\" battle where one side knows in advance that they can not win, engage in minimal fighting to maintain a sense of honor, and then surrender under terms that are mutually acceptable, even if onerous to the losing side.  Victors over a vanquished enemy often were the most vicious when the victors had suffered many unnecessary casualties.  Sledge and his front line compatriots showed this resentment in fighting an enemy whose goal is \\"to inflict maximum losses on the American forces.  The tactics turned Okinawa into a blood bath.\\"<br /> Another reason why this racism may be overblown, especially on the part of Sledge, is the fact that he was from the segregated south.  His family had also fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.  I did not find any of this type of Black Racism in Sledge nor did I find it transferred by Sledge to his Japanese adversaries.<br /> All this being said, both the American fighting man and the American public transferred America's Black Racism to the Japanese by their perception of Japanese behavior and American propaganda.  They were different and their Bushido Creed and Emperor worship supported their contempt for those who would not fight to the death, for them surrender was not an option.<br /> Neither Sledge and his men nor the Japanese military on the front line were interested in the fact that extremely high American casualties might result in a negotiated peace settlement more favorable to the Japanese than Unconditional Surrender.  This is left to the policy makers whom are not a part of Sledge's world will make these calculations.<br /> Sledge's book also gives the reader insight from the Japanese side of the conflict.  This is not the purpose of the book but it is a subtle message shown in the book.  It ties in with Sledge's many comments on the waste of war in terms of lives lost and destroyed.  The Japanese have the advantage of terrain and fortifications against the Americans who have to come to them to settle the issue in combat.  The Japanese have their version of \\"Live Free or Die.\\"<br /> Victor Davis Hanson rates With the Old Breed by Sledge as the second most important book in his listing of \\"The definitive books on the battles of the 20th century.\\"<br />There are some brilliant memoirs of the savage battle for Okinawa, but E.B. Sledge's is by far the most haunting. Sledge, who landed with the Marines on both Okinawa and Peleliu islands, describes in matter-of-fact prose how the superior discipline and bonds between fellow Marines overcame the often brilliant fighting of the desperate Japanese, who hugely outnumbered [if they had come out of their entrenchments to fight the Americans on the beach.  This numerical advantage would have been meaningless and very suicidal in face of American Naval and Air superiority.]  the Americans and fought from impenetrable subterranean concrete and coral-covered gun emplacements.  \\"With the Old Breed\\" might serve as an antiwar ode, but the book ends by reminding the reader how well the U.S. was served in its hour of need by rare men such as his own--men that Sledge thinks it may well need again.<br />It is interesting to see how other writers, historians, and pundits have used Sledge's book since the end of World War II.  Studs Terkel's, \\"The Good War\\": An Oral History of World War Two (New York, 1985) uses Sledge's work to show that WWII was a \\"Good\\" War while Vietnam is a bad one.  The internet also can give the reader the chance to hear Sledge tell his own story in his own voice.  As you listen to him, his book becomes more real.  It is hard to believer that this soft spoken man, now a PhD, did what he did and he was not alone.  It is his voice that speaks for many others [[...]<br /> Although some can see Sledge's work as an antiwar tract, Hanson and others use Sledge's book to show that Americans have put themselves in harm's way for the good of their country.  As Sledge himself says, \\"They did their duty so a sheltered homeland can enjoy the peace that was purchased at such a high cost.  We owe those Marines a profound debt of gratitude.\\"<br /> The author Paul Fussell has caught the fact that \\"Sledge wrote this memoir less for strangers than to tell his own family what his war had been like.\\"  Paul Fussell not only wrote the current introduction of the Sledge's book in 1990.  In it, he also shows how the book can be used to justify the immediate use of the Atomic Bomb against an enemy who would not surrender.  The Marines and Army had used flame throwing tanks to clear the enemy from their entrenched positions in the Pacific.  Sledge and the front line fighters were happy that Truman used the Atomic Bomb for the same purpose against mainland Japan.<br />Paul Fussell has latterly found fame verging on notoriety for his mordantly witty yet deeply serious dissenting position on two of the determining military issues of the age. In the first place he dissents from the widely credited if often unexamined propositions enunciated by A. J. P. Taylor and propagated by Studs Terkel that, \\"Despite all the killing and destruction that accompanied it, the Second World War was a good war.\\" For Fussell, who was there, it was nothing of the kind. \\"It was a war and nothing else, and thus stupid and sadistic.\\" In the second place he dissents from any condemnation of the decision to drop the bomb in 1945, a dissent memorably registered in the title essay of his most recent collection, Thank God for the Atomic Bomb. In the early 1990s both positions have a tendency to surprise. Conjoined, they are positively shocking--an effect one suspects Fussell himself has taken some pains to achieve.<br /> Alex Danchev also drives home the point about the fact that fighting for your country is neither immoral nor futile.<br /> The book also loses the argument. Eugene Sledge for one is perfectly clear. In a passage not  quoted by Fussell, his memoir concludes with the thought that, though war is indeed \\"brutish,  inglorious and a terrible waste until the millennium arrives and countries cease enslaving others it  will be necessary to accept responsibility to make sacrifices as my comrades did.\\"<br /><br /> Sledge's full quote is:<br /><br />Until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and to be willing to make sacrifices for one's country -- as my comrades did.  As the troops used to say, \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\"  With privilege goes responsibility.<br /><br />Sledge's book should be required reading for all courses that deal with foreign policy questions, World War II in particular, because it takes these issues from the cerebrum to the smell of the foxhole where wars are fought.  The book is a call to all future policy makers to do more than their absolute best either to prevent a war from occurring or to be prepared to end it quickly if one needs to be fought so that others will not be filled \\"with anger at the war and the realization of the senseless waste.\\"  This required reading should be accompanied by a required 3 to 4 page book report as well as class discussion.  Once this has been achieved, students will have a much better understanding of the implications of how they feel foreign policy should be conducted.<br />After reading Sledge, it would be interesting to see how many students would still want Sledge and his men to be on the front line landing on a beach on mainland Japan.ith the Marines on both Okinawa and Peleliu islands, describes in matter-of-fact prose how the superior discipline and bonds between fellow Marines overcame the often brilliant fighting of the desperate Japanese, who hugely outnumbered [if they had come out of their entrenchments to fight the Americans on the beach.

B0007WPJBQ|3.0|After reading some reviews which praised the Digiview version of One Eyed Jacks, and having seen many bad releases in the past, I took the plunge and bought the Digiview release.  Unfortunately, while the print is in widescreen, my copy anyway was NOT anamorphic.  It is also still a poor quality copy with soft, faded edges and weak color.  I suppose its the best version of the ones I have seen but a long way from being acceptable viewing on today's Hi-def TVs.  When will someone get hold of the original negatives of this film and produce a quality release?  Criterion, TCM are you listening?
0545123275|5.0|Shiver is a wonderful, beautifully written book that will move you to tears. Maggie Stiefvater has done an amazing, incredulous job on this book and deserves the highest praise. The language and prose are excellent, and the character development is phenomenal. The passion and emotion that are present are stunning. Stiefvater has created a stellar book, a piece of high-quality art, that teenagers and adults will enjoy for quite a while.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Overall, \\"The Book of Eli\\" is a respectable, post-Apocalyptic movie, with strong performances by Washington and Oldman.  However, it suffered from two main problems.  One is post-Apocalyptic fatigue.  Seems like there have been many such movies over the last few years (\\"The Road\\", \\"Doomsday\\", and \\"Resident Evil - Extinction\\" come to mind).  After a while, these start to look and feel alike.  The second problem is the premise -- that somehow bibles have become non-existent.  Considering how many bibles have been printed and distributed since forever, this seems quite implausible.  There are certainly many more bibles than guns--and the movie had no lack of guns. Also there probably weren't enough people left after \\"The Flash\\" to mount a campaign to burn all bibles.  Aned even if there were, people were probably too preoccupied with surviving to care.  All in all, an unrealistic premise on which to base a movie.
0143038095|5.0|There's a reason some books become best sellers - they're just plain good. I truly believe that great stories are given to us by the gods, and that wonderful authors are the mediums for greatness.  This is a perfect example.
B00005JLWN|5.0|this is a great movie, it has everything a good movie needs; action, emotion and a good plot that kept me engaged the entire time. i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of action movies, i got mine for around 7 bucks with shipping so for that price this movie couldn't get any better.
0307454541|4.0|A little shocking, I must admit.  More edgy than American crime fiction. Enjoying the sequel as well.
0380715430|5.0|I owned this book for many years before I read another Bryson book... It was a book I loved the first time I read it and every time thereafter. I never paid attention to the name of the author, at first, and, for some inexplicable reason, had always had some vague the author was a woman. Many years after acquiring the book I was lent a copy of [[ASIN:076790818X A Short History of Nearly Everything]] (which I ended up reading in one night). Afterwards, I made a note of the author's name (intending to buy more of his/her works) and realized that the writer of this highly enjoyable book was the creator of the 'Mother Tongue'.<br /><br />I realize this book has been roundly criticized for numerous factual errors and I would prefer to know that some areas had been better researched. However, that being said, if you want an erudite scholarly work you will generally end up with something that reads like an erudite, scholarly work... this book is a light-hearted romp and I don't think Mr Bryson has ever pretended it was otherwise. He makes me laugh with many of his turns of phrase... I can always go check facts against other works if the need arises.<br /><br />C.J. Thompson
B00006G8K0|5.0|Lee's performance is still startling today. One minute he's a charming aristocrat, the next a wild-eyed animal - swift, strong, and single-mindedly hungry for blood. With no prosthetic make-up, his Dracula is scary because of the blood dripping from his lips, his bloodshot eyes and his demonic performance. When a crucifix comes out, he reacts like a cornered snake, and hisses in disgust. Here is a villain from Hell, clever, dangerous and evil. There's no moral dilemma - Dracula must be destroyed.<br /><br />Although the film is fifty years old, Christopher Lee is still with us, still acting. While he's found a new fanbase as Saruman in Lord of the Rings and Count Dooku in the Star Wars franchise, he landed both roles because of the lasting impression of his Dracula films.<br /><br />Lower down the cast, but also still with us is Geoffrey Bayldon. This actor often played far older characters. Here's he's a grey-haired porter, even though he was only 34! You may have seen him as the tour guide in Tales From The Crypt, creepy Max in Asylum and Theo the cloak-seller in The House that Dripped Blood. Like Lee, he's still working!<br /><br />Likewise, the lovely Janina Faye as the little girl being pursued by the undead. Her scene with Van Helsing, as he protects her from the night's chill, is a lovely moment of calm amidst the horror. It's not easy finding talented child actors who act their age. I also enjoyed her roles in two Janette Scott movies The Day of the Triffids and The Beauty Jungle.<br /><br />Christopher Lee starred as Dracula in six more Hammer films. They'd have used him more - but he was substituted by other actors when he put his foot down and avoided Brides of Dracula and The Legend of Seven Golden Vampires.<br /><br />Horror of Dracula (as it was released in the USA) moved the character of Van Helsing into the spotlight, a character who's as virtuous as Dracula is evil. On the face of it, Van Helsing is an anti-hero, a man who digs up the dead and mutilates them, but played by Peter Cushing, he's not only pure, he's a polite and considerate gentleman as well. You couldn't find a better role model... who stakes vampires. It's a shame that modern audiences only know Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in the first Star Wars, because it was such an atypical role for a versatile and compassionate actor - my very favourite in the horror genre.he's not only pure, he's a polite and considerate gentleman as well.

0307277453|4.0|Other reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the subject of the book and I won't attempt to improve upon them. Rather, I'll just add my two cents as to the style and 'enjoyability' of the work...<br /><br />First, let me say that Mr Shubin has a very pleasant and readable style of writing. He presents his theses in a way that is graspable by the non-scientist and non-confrontational, as compared by recent works that discuss evolution and religious belief together.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this is a book that will only entertain persons who are not religious fundamentalists and who already have a fairly decent appreciation of the fundamentals (no pun intended) of the evolutionary process. There are lots of books, of recent publication, that have weighed into the rationalism vs. irrationalism, science vs.religion controversies but this is not one of them.... Look to this book for an interesting addition to biological knowledge rather than a philisophical treatise concerning the origin of life.<br /><br />C. John Thompson
B00002Z88D|5.0|I'm not usually into the whole reviewing thing on Amazon but after reading some of the 1 star reviews for this CD I figured I'd put in my two cents. First off, to address the product for any potential future buyers, this album is a must own if you are a fan of Metallica as I am. Michael Kamen (God rest his soul) was an incredibly talented composer who had previously worked with Metallica on one of their best songs ever recorded, \\"Nothing Else Matters\\". The song selection for the concert was great in my opinion, \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" kicks it off followed by \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" two amazing instrumentals (Ktulu sounds awesome with the orchestra) and the lead in from Ktulu to \\"Master of Puppets\\" along with the crowd reaction gives me chills. I won't go too in depth with the track selection but will say the two previously unreleased tracks \\"No Leaf Clover\\" and \\"-Human\\" are very good. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra is simply amazing and is blended well with the band. In short, if you're a fan of Metallica and enjoy classical music (I myself am NOT an avid listener of classical but still enjoy it occasionally) then i suggest picking this up. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Now on to part two of my review which is for all the 1 star reviews out there. I've read quite a few of them and all of them, or at least most, have one thing in common, the so called \\"true metal fans\\" out there that believe Metallica had sold out by doing this concert. Some claim Metallica had forgotten how to play their older material, hence the reason it doesn't show up on this album. But that's not the case, I believe that the speed at which Metallica played on Kill 'Em All would probably not have sounded that great with the orchestra, but there are songs from that \\"golden age\\" that are on S&M, and I saw them in concert last year and they played Seek and Destroy, so no, they haven't forgotten how to play anything.<br /><br />I wouldn't consider myself a \\"true metal fan\\", I consider myself a MUSIC fan. I listen to everything from heavy metal to country and I'm not afraid to admit it. I love rap music and the golden oldies, classic rock and blues. If it sounds good I'll listen to it. I know I'm getting off topic but whatever, it's my review and I feel it needs to be said. I can't stick to just one certain genre of music, it gets boring after a while.<br /><br />So this is to all those true metal fans out there that think Metallica became garbage after Cliff died, I'm sorry you feel that way, and I'm truly sorry you have become so narrow minded to think the way that you do and it's sad that you will never appreciate what Metallica has become.<br /><br />Have fun living in the 80's.<br /><br />I'm done, thank you for reading.MUSIC fan.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|Maybe I cheated by watching the special feature about the making of the movie before watching the movie, but it helped to reinforce that I shouldn't expect the old Sherlock Holmes, and maybe that helped me to relax and enjoy the movie for the delight that it was.  My following comments might seem rather critical, but keep in mind that I still gave it four (4) stars, and I'm trying to not spoil the climax for any of you who still plan to see it.    Two scenes in particular seemed particularly disjointed, as the action took place and then Holmes recounted in slower motion and more detail what actually happened.  One near the beginning of the movie was when he quickly donned a disquise to follow the lady, and the other was in the denumont as he explained how he was duped, allowing a villian to get away with a key item which might lead to the sequel.  (One can hope that it does.)    In another, boxing fight scene, Holmes previews what he is going to do in slow motion with explanation, and then returns to real time and does it.  Although the scene is referenced again in a later scene, I'm still wondering what the actual sequence added to the movie, other than showing two men fighting with their shirts off, and reinforcing the cold, calculating, practical, logic of Holmes.    The explosion scene outside the factory seemed about two steps over the top, as the secondary and tertiary explosions seemed to go on forever, followed with the shock that Watson survived at all, (though you know in the back of your mind that they can't kill off the lead's main supporting character,) and Holmes was able to walk away.  I did think it good, though, that they at least portrayed the \\"shell shock\\" that he was under for a few seconds, even though it was terribly unrealistically compressed.  Ah-h, the magic of movies.    Speaking of which, I did enjoy the way Holmes interspersed some of his explanations of the \\"elementary\\" tricks, and the grand explanation at the end.  Throughout the movie,I was hoping that the secret of the villian surviving the hanging would be different than I expected, but alas, it is exactly what any fan of the genre knows it to be the moment that they see that the hung man appears to have returned from the dead.    Nevertheless, I thought that the entire story was very true to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle style, and the story line engaging -- although the ending was almost obviously inevitable from the beginning, there were some surprises in how they got from one act to the next.  It was obvious and appreciable that they went to great efforts to stay true to the period with the story, sets, costumes, and special effects.  If you watch it from a critical perspective, there are lots of little things to question and challenge.  Keeping in mind that it's just a story, it's well depicted, and very enjoyable viewing.    (I was lucky to pick up a former rental copy for less than the cost of a rental.  I'm still not sure if I would buy it if I had to pay more, and if I were not the Sherlock Holmes fan that I have been since childhood.)
0061906220|5.0|I loved Pete the Cat.  I usually love the School Library Journal reviews but am disappointed with this review.  I first became familiar with Pete the Cat while teaching a 4 year old class at a camp this summer.  We read this one day in Music & sang along.  Pete always has a great attitude & keeps going even when he encounters obstacles. Plus, the kids loved Pete & the words are easy to learn!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is the knife that inspires confidence. You'll not make a safe queen out of this knife, it begs to do the toughest of camp chores and is always ready for more. The black scales while OK were not up to my standards for this great tool so I also purchased and installed Micarta scales. With the new scales the knife looks and performs much better. The other negative which isn't the knife but the sheath was the cheap seat-belt material used for the belt loop. I removed the assembly as a unit and made one up out of leather. The hi-tech plastic with the vintage looking leather loop and keeper make the knife look like a custom made one. All said and done the BK2 did all of what was asked of it suck as whittling,battoning,cutting,chopping and more while backpacking in deep the wilderness at 8500'elevatin. The BK2 is still sharp after two weeks of this. I will be buying another one for my 17 year old son who I couldn't get mine back from.
0321701763|5.0|This is the best Photoshop Classroom in a Book ever. We didn't have the first one (Photoshop 4, I think) but we've brushed up our Photoshop skills with just about every other Photoshop \\"CIB\\" (as the regular readers call them). We are honored to be part of a group of Photoshop professionals and educators around the world who make a deep dive into this app. A fair number of us get the latest Classroom in a Book plus watch the videos on [...] every time a new version is released. However, this book is also perfect for someone who has never used Photoshop, before. No offense to my fellow authors but if there was just one Photoshop learning package you could buy, this should be it. This version of the book includes a great video series on the DVD. From the video, I picked up a few things I never heard anyone discuss anywhere (and we go back to Photoshop 2.0). This isn't just a how-to book. It's inspirational. The examples get our creative minds in gear. In addition to Photoshop, you'll gain essential insight into Adobe Camera Raw and Bridge. Part of what draws some of the best and most brilliant in Photoshop to this book, version after version, is that it provides clever application of the newest features. These are things Adobe cannot be expected to cram into the users manual. Therefore, Ps CS5 CIB is a perfect complement to the manual. We're pleased to see the inclusion of special feature spreads such as one on professional workflow and the continued insights from Photoshop evangelist, Julieanne Kost, one of the original Photoshop users even before version 1.0 shipped. An entire chapter on new type uses is appreciated along with the often overlooked vector techniques. We have been posting articles to [...] on painting with Photoshop and the new mixer brush and are pleased to see a complete chapter on this, too. Many photographers initially think they do not have the ability to change a photo into a painter. This chapter assists in demonstrating how easy it is. The same can be said for how quickly you will learn about the ease of use there is to Photoshop's 3D features. This chapter makes you feel you \\"can do.\\" The authors of this book have even found a means of revving you, creatively, with a chapter on color consistency including samples on gardening visuals and text. Everyone knows this app as \\"Photoshop CS5.\\" The splash screen tells the full story: Photoshop 12. It has been over 20 years since Photoshop 1.0 debuted. Adobe's Photoshop team just keeps packing more and more features into it. The manual is 613 pages. Attempting to even approach mastering Photoshop is a daunting task. Classroom in a Book is not going to teach you every single feature; no book can. However, by the time you get to page 366 and watch the entire video, you will have significant proficiency in all key areas of Photoshop. At that point, nothing about the app will seem foreign. You should feel comfortable enough to go anywhere and do anything in Photoshop CS5 with competency. I'm pleased with accuracy of the written information and exercises. They are easy to follow and produce satisfying results. Whoever designed the video screen layout did an excellent job. Janet & I have begun to explore Illustrator CS5 CIB and hope to post a review, next week.can be said for how quickly you will learn about the ease of use there is to Photoshop's 3D features.

0143118420|5.0|I loved this book!! Thank you for your well written story that has touched my life. I am surprised I haven't had this experience yet in my own life. I am in a similar place and needed to read this story. I am doing my own 3 month eat, pray, love. I read you don't read any of your reviews anymore and I have came to believe that some people just don't understand a spiritual journey.       Thanks again!  Elizabeth A Ziegler

B000N6TX1I|5.0|The reason most dystopian films fail is the lack of realism.  Whether a flying car or talking ape ruins credibility, there is always something unbelievable distracting the viewer.  In this film, however, there is enough familiarity with the picture of impending apocalypse - regardless of scientific likelihood - that it feels possible.<br /><br />The year is a believable 2027 (thanks to the subtle cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki), an expanded neon world in shambles, governments have collapsed, armed insurrection threatens anarchy.  As a result of harsh immigration policies, Britain serves as the desired destination...if one can get past the immigration camps (read: concentration camps), swarms of menacing guards with machine guns and dogs, and vicious bands of outsiders who have formed ad hoc societies to survive.  A credible global political climate exists where fringe groups war with an apathetic, if not conspiratorial government.  Making matters worse is the death of \\"baby Diego,\\" humankind's youngest living person, which has shocked seemingly everyone except former activist Theo (Clive Owen).  Every bit the flawed hero, Theo apathetically drones through his alcohol and cigarette filled day of avoiding emotions.  Birth is now seemingly impossible - none for over 18 years - extinction is imminent.  Hope is lost.  Not until Theo is reunited with his ex-wife Julian (Juliane Moore), an underground militia leader whose organization is protecting Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the first pregnant woman in eighteen years, does he embrace the reluctant role of protecting humanity's last hope, thereby finding a purpose and possible salvation.<br /><br />Like McCarthy's \\"The Road,\\" the power in the despair is the possibility.  In fact, this could very well be the precursor to McCarthy's vision; it's a world with a glimmer of hope, a dash of humanity, and a step removed from the complete chaos of a world with nearly feral humans.  While there is a definite gut punch in Children of Men, and similar themes of humanity's demise persist (e.g. famine, disease), it's not quite as hopeless as the starving, exhausting cross-country march in The Road for a single reason: birth causes hope to spring eternal.  True credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron for creating a world in which giving up may be the best answer, but holding onto hope is the likeliest choice.<br /><br />Acting-wise, Clive Owens truly comes into his own as a hero.  I've never quite felt the same way about a character he has portrayed, but the vulnerability of Theo made him appealing...especially when he went the second half of the movie in flip flops (don't ask).  The rest of the cast fills in their required gaps, with Pam Ferris acting like a renegade wet-nurse who remembers birthing before the baby drought, Chiwetel Ejiofor balances good and evil while desperately trying to fill the shoes being worn by Clive Owens, and Michael Caine gives the viewer a peek inside the chemically enhanced mind of an eternal optimist.<br /><br />By the time the second act breaks, this is a full-fledged, war-torn action (passable but not spectacular) movie and all that's left is watching to see if Theo will deliver Kee and her baby to safety.  Highly engrossing, highly recommended.ilar themes of humanity's demise persist (e.g. famine, disease), it's not quite as hopeless as the starving, exhausting cross-country march in The Road for a single reason: birth causes hope to spring eternal.

B003S897U0|5.0|While we've seen 'unplugged' efforts from a variety of artists in the past, very few compare to Croweology in terms of content and execution. This is not (a) acoustic (as many reviews suggest), (b) completely unplugged, nor (c) a greatest hits compilation.     It is a well-conceived and executed album that mixes hits, fan-favorites, and rarities driven largely by acoustical arrangements in an unplugged fashion (noting that there are electrical elements that are added moderately and appropriately). The separation of vocals from the music is exceptional, and as noted in other reviews, Robinson's vocals present his best effort in years- the melodies remain intact, and the passion is evident.     Other bands should take note- this is the way to do an unplugged set. My only hope is the intended hiatus is short in duration, and that they tucked away another disc or two of out-takes from this session for a future companion release...
B003NX76BM|4.0|I have read all of Nora Roberts books and this isnt one of her best but it is a good interesting book. I think whoever reads i will be entertained.
0920236251|3.0|I really love this book and so does my daughter, but I was extremely disappointed in the size of the book.  I guess I should have looked at the size, but that's not always something one would look at when purchasing a book online - I know better now.  It would help with such items as these to place \\"pocket size\\" or \\"travel size\\" which usually means that it's small.  I have read this book to my daughter and son at night with great difficulty b/c they couldn't see the pictures/book at the same time.  I will be re-ordering a bigger size of this book.  I guess I should have known by the price as well, but I thought I had found a super-great deal, but found out otherwise!  Very disappointed, but partly my fault; should have look at size.  Anyway, great read:children and adults will enjoy this book.  Check the dimensions!!!!
B00005N6RU|1.0|Unfortunately I was not able to watch the movie due to some irregular situtations in regard to the dvd.  It wouldn't play and I'm not entirely sure that the seller is cooperating.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I own every other season on DVD, so I will buy this one. Season 6 was mediocre. It felt like the spent the first 2/3 of the season wasting time and tap dancing. Then, the really ramped it up a notch and started cramming stuff into the last 4 episodes.    But it if you want to complete your collection, otherwise spend your money on something else.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Am I the only one seeing repeated footage? Seriously!   I counted 3 times that they showed the fox chase the deer up the cliff.  The dolphins making cloudy circles at least twice.  And I'm not talking about short snippets, I'm talking full scene repeats (with different dialogue).  This is a sly way of making 11 episodes out of footage for 10.  Oprah is slack as well (I liked Mrs. Weaver much better)  David Attenborough is THE MAN!
B002N1AF7C|5.0|Had this when I was a kid on album, lost it and it's been hard to find.  Love it.
145283668X|4.0|I have been wanting to read this book for years due to all the movies and shows that make reference to it.  It really wasn't what I expected, but I found it surprisingly interesting and psychological.  Right away, the cover grabbed my attention.  It made me want to turn the page and start reading immediately.  The format made it light and easy to stash in my purse and read in my spare time at the airport.  It kept my attention and left me pondering the duality of personalities.  I thought it was a very thought provoking book, but fun and entertaining.
B000FZERIG|2.0|except for give me love,don't let me wait too long and be here now...hippy junk
1439102937|2.0|Let me rephrase that: she tries hard, which is kind of a bad thing here. She tries too hard to come off as clever, witty, and in-the-know. The writing style is sometimes cute, but the cloying attempts at sarcasm, wit, and appearing \\"in\\" are annoying. Actually I'm wrong in saying she's not accomplishing much -- at least she's making a lot of money (at readers' expense) and is getting published. So, good for her on that front, because that's more than a lot of people can say. Yes, of course she has connections. And if you had those connections, you'd use them too, wouldn't you? Okay then.    So, that explains the second star. As far as the book itself, it's garbage. Yes, we'd all exploit our opportunities if given them on a silver platter -- just like Weisberger has -- but WOW. You'd think she could do better than this, considering her educational pedigree.    The story is simplistic: many readers have already provided a synopsis of the \\"plot\\" so I won't get into that. Weisberger's storytelling is NOT good. Sometimes her writing style is humorous, and I think her approach to writing might be excellent for a small college newspaper's editorial section. However, for a major novel released by a major publisher, it's just a no go.    Again, I applaud Weisberger for parlaying her connections and life experiences into making her a major literary figure (BTW - her novel \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was also dreck, but you already knew that), but the actual products she releases are not good. \\"Chasing Harry Winston\\" is just further proof that you don't really have to be a good writer to make it as a writer.
B00275EHJG|5.0|First and foremost if you are actually reading this and you haven't seen it, get up off your ass and go to the theater right now! I know it is still playing in a theater somewhere!<br /><br />It has been 11 years since we have seen these characters and I will say when I heard about a script in the works for the third chapter I was a bit skeptical for many reasons. Apparently this movie started out as a direct to DVD release when first conceptualized about...4/5 years ago. It was not going to be in CGI and the plot was about Woody and the gang rescuing Buzz from Japan after he and other first edition Buzz Lightyear figures were recalled to the manufacture. Yea, that could have worked, but this is Toy Story! I mean when we all went to see this movie about 15 years ago we were just awestruck by these unbelievable characters. The movie was full of such magic and the story was so original that is just made you think about your own Toys and how great they felt when you played with them. I know I am going on and on, but that just shows you how meaningful Toy Story is to me and film as a whole.<br /><br />Toy Story 3, does not meet up to the grandeur of its predecessors. Toy Story 3 goes above and beyond anything that this story has given us so far. Toy Story 3 turns this simple little world into a massive epic, and the story itself while it may be so simple and easy to follow, there are just so many different emotional levels seen throughout. There are points in the movie where you will laugh so hard and then in the following scene you will be trying so hard to hold back tears. In the theater I was in, I saw grown men cry. For that to happen because of a movie, it just shows you there is something truly special here. The Pixar animation has come so far since Toy Story, that the textures and scenery that you see in this installment are so believable and lifelike you can almost touch them yourself. The voice acting is fantastic as well. Along with the story, the cast returns and steps up their game as well. Each character is given so much more depth and the funnier members of the bunch get even funnier. On top of that we are introduced a whole new batch of toys. Each one is unique in its own way and the new actors that lent their voices did a wonderful job, it was as almost as if there were there from the start. There are not many jokes that play on satire or pop culture like Shrek, but the humor that is used just works. The movie is great for all ages, but I believe it was really made for those that have been there from the beginning. You can tell by some of the scenes that it is not only because you have known these characters growing up, but it is the fact that you are now seeing these characters as a grown up and how you must have felt when you realized it was time to stop playing with your own toys and if they were like these characters what they must be feeling. On that note, probably the best part of this film would have to be the ending. I don't think I have seen a story end on such a high note since 'Return of the King' It just makes you feel so many different kinds of wonderful emotions. The feelings that you leave with towards these characters, in fact the entire legacy that Toy Story has become, you could not have asked for a more proper send off.<br /><br />Now, after reading this I sure hope that if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 that you will. Brush up on your Toy Story and Toy Story 2, because when you see Toy Story 3 you will be very glad you did. Pixar really has outdone them selves with this film. As a person who has seen almost every Disney animated film and who owns every Pixar film, Toy Story 3 could arguably be the greatest Disney animated film ever made! This movie has been praised by fans and critics everywhere since its theatrical release. It makes me wonder where the Pixar gang will go with future projects, some of which will be sequels to other Pixar classics. In fact I don't think 2010 can possibly give us anything better in film! I have already seen Inception and I have to say that Toy Story just adds that little bit of extra magic. Toy Story 3 to me at this point is the best film of 2010, it has surpassed The Incredibles as my all time favorite Pixar film. I sure hope that this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture of the year, yea I am going to stick to that last statment because a film like Toy Story 3 is why we go to see movies and purchase them in the first place. Not only do we want to be entertained, or just escape the hardships of every day life, in the end what we truly want from the films is that sense of perfection that goes deep within our souls. While that feeling maybe different for everyone if you find that feeling it just sets everything right in the world. Like Peter Jackson, John Lassater deserves his credit that has been due to him ever since he created Toy Story. To get an award as prestigious as the Oscar for best film will show the world that animation can be just as real as live action and if you just have the desire and the passion to create something special that is not depicted by something that is entirely real, you can sure as hell do the best that you can to make it real.<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!

0316010669|5.0|\\"Blink\\" conceptualizes a new manner of thinking about our cognitive abilities.  Rather than focusing on the power of the human mind and its ability to understand and solve problems through the development of complex statistical models and qualitative means of evaluation, author Malcom Gladwell dwells on the ability of the human subconscious and our ability to make snap decisions.  Told through a series of entertaining and vivid vignettes, \\"Blink\\" illustrates how our thought processes can be both our greatest tool and our greatest impediment in making our most important decisions.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Blink\\", Gladwell highlights a variety of research dedicated to understanding human cognition and shows how that research can help us improve our understanding of people, our decisions, and human emotions.  From art dealers to major military decision-makers Gladwell shows the role of our unconscious thoughts understanding the world around us.  \\"Blink\\" reads like a novel, but manages to be powerfully informative.<br /><br /> Gladwell mixes information with a deeper inquisition of the status quo and pushes the reader to challenge their perceptions of the world.  He shows that we can become trapped behind the limitations of our own thinking or deceived by the falsehood of the \\"truths\\" we have been presented.  I was thoroughly entertained by \\"Blink\\" and I found that it presented a similarly fresh perspective to that of Freakonomics.<br /><br />Gladwell integrates an underlying moral imperative to ensure that our decisions are not based upon prejudices or biases which we may be unaware of.  I would recommend \\"Blink\\" to any reader, but it has powerful implications for those involved with the social sciences or those forced to make complex decisions with little information.  \\"Blink\\" won't necessarily provide you with new mental tools, but it will ensure that you are properly using the ones that you already have.

B003INBOE2|5.0|I bought this movie after coming across it, while searching for other movies on amazon...  The reviewers sold it for me, and I must say that they were DEAD ON with their reviews...    This Movie is very Entertaining!  The Cinematography is Perfect!  The Story Line is Great!  The acting was Good!  The Martial Arts was FANTASTIC & EPIC!  The Sound Effects were Excellent!    The movie is set in a different time period, but that doesn't change the Excitement or Interest Level!    I thoroughly enjoyed this movie & will SAY THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE OF ALL TIME, IF NOT THE BEST!!!    GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!    I hope they will do more movies that tie into this one, or at least with the same main actor!    Thanks...
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This was a perfect transaction. It was just as they said, and it came very very fast.
0470503696|4.0|I am an accountant--not a programmer and I am only about 1/2 way through the book.  I need this information to improve my job skills.  I need to complete Excel spreadsheets faster, more accurately, and less manually repetitiously.  I am learning many new things that are going to help reach that goal.  My previous experience with Macros only included what you could write with the keystroke wizard method (which is very limiting).    Starting around Chap 7, Mr. Walkenbach starts giving a lot of examples of code that is setting dimensions; static counters, offsets; cells vs ranges, etc, but he doesn't complete those examples with the actually code that would run some macro after the previously defined dimensions.  I would prefer to see how each actually work; thus I need an example of some code in each case so I can type it and run it.  Maybe in some following chapters, he get to it, but by then I will have to go back and review.      Guess this is why this is a book for \\"Dummies\\"--looks like I qualify. LOL  All in all, I'm getting along well.  And occasionally, he throws something funny in--which gives me major amusement considering how intense all of this language is for non-computer programming techie like me.      I recommend this book as a good starting place for someone like me who has some experience using the Macro Record tool in Excel.
B002RT69QQ|1.0|I got it because it was cheap. Well, you get what you pay for. It hasn't worked for me since day one. It actually ruined a few of my flash cards.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I had to order The Lion King on Amazon.com because Disney has this movie stuck in the vault for the next several years. I think it's worth getting though. The Lion King was one of the best animated movies of all time, and definitely one of the best by Disney. There's nothing I could write about this movie that you don't already know. It's good!
B0015DROBO|4.0|It took me while to get into this book. Once I did I liked it for the most part. Disappointed to realize that I had guessed the ending about half way through. I would not give it 5 stars but its a good read.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I started collecting Disney animated movies right after this one went back into the vault. Thank God for Amazon.com so I could order this one and add it to my collection. The songs in this movie are by far some of my very favorite songs in any Disney animated movie. I do believe if this movie was released to theaters today brand new, it would do as well, if not better, than it did when it first came out. So cute!
B003405MF6|5.0|Word's completely fail me with Beck's latest creation.  By far, the majority of popular music ever produced with the illustrious Fender Stratocaster has been aggressive, driving, rock.  This sweetest of instruments very close in my mind to a Stradivarius, is capable of astounding feel, subtlety, and depth.  It is very rare that a rock guitarist transcends all the hype and glamour of his role and connects so sweetly with an instrument like Jeff has in E&C.  All the speed and technical prowess in the world doesn't hold a candle to a musician who becomes one with their instrument and produces a rare moment of emotional bliss in the listener.  I was completely overwhelmed and moved to tears by the many such moments Jeff has given us in this album.      A must have recording from a treasured musician!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I almost wish I would have waited til the end of this year to buy this movie (when it's going to be re-released). When I bought this one on Amazon.com, I didn't realize Disney was taking it out of the vault in late 2010. However, I have no regrets buying this movie. The songs are fantastic. The dance scene for \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" in the ballroom is gorgeous...every little girls dream! Disney outdid themselves with this movie! It's definitely a must-have for any Disney lovers collection.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|I'm in total agreement with the other posters that this is the best performance of \\"Four Last Songs\\".  I'll point out one (there are many) highlight for you.  It's in the third song, \\"Beim Schlafengehen\\" (Going to Sleep), in the last stanze of Hesse's poem.  Norman's singing of the phrase \\"Und die Seele\\" (And my soul) is one of the most overwhelmingly powerful, moving, and beautiful things I have ever heard in my 50+ years of listening to music.<br /><br />The whole performance is masterful in all regards without a hint of artifice anywhere.  The Gewandhaus is in fine form.  And, Masur's conducting couldn't be better.  This is about as perfect of a performance as I know.<br /><br />And, for those who aren't familiar with \\"Four Last Songs\\", Strauss wrote these songs when he was 84 years old.  He knew he probably didn't have a lot of time left on this Earth (his health was poor), and in fact he didn't live long enough to hear these works performed. So, we have one of the greatest masters of the female voice, and orchestra putting to song this great poetry about impending death.<br /><br />Like this performance, these works don't have a hint of artifice either.  They are easily my favorite works of Strauss, and among my favorite works, period, when I want to listen to music that will emotionally overpower me, and bring me to tears every time.<br /><br />I think this CD would be a welcomed addition to every classical music lover's collection.  It gets my highest recommendation.
B0001I561E|5.0|What Disney collection wouldn't be complete without Aladdin?! True, Genie is the star of this movie--Robin Williams is a comedic genius. But the magic and the love story are incredible. Not sure when Disney is re-releasing this movie out of the vault, but it's definitely worth getting and holding onto. Sure to be a Disney classic for lifetimes to come.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|I just got back from a trip to Cozumel and I took this camera case with me to house my point-and-shoot Cannon PowerShot. The camera fit perfectly and there was was enough room in the front zipper compartment for an extra set of batteries and more memory. It is light weight and well padded with a very handy velcro loop that is excellent for easily attaching to your purse, belt or anything with a strap. It opened easily, but did not come open when I didn't want it to. I carried the camera everywhere and the camera case made it so convenient. I can't say enough good things about this case. It really made our vacation picture taking very pleasant.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The most memorable scene-the spaghetti dinner--is a classic in and of itself. Though I was a little disappointed by the way the casing arrived after I ordered this movie, I quickly got over it when I started watching this movie for the first time in years. I love Disney and couldn't imagine not having this one as part of my collection.
B003L20IDS|5.0|We caught a midnight show of this, and it was the most original and enjoyable movie I've seen in a very long time. For those not familiar with the general plot: Scott falls for a cute girl named Ramona, and later learns that he can only date her if he defeats her \\"seven evil exes\\" in battle.<br /><br />The movie effortlessly and playfully moves between reality, video-game surrealism, dream surrealism, and media-based effects (e.g., mimicking a sitcom or a \\"Pop-Up Video\\" effect). One moment the characters are walking, the next they're passing through a metaphorical door into their conversation, and as they return there's a clearly-labeled video-game leveled challenge. This is ballsy -- if done poorly, it would've come across as gimmicky and stupid, but Wright pulls it off brilliantly, transitioning seamlessly between styles as if he were merely recording alternating lines of dialogue.<br /><br />The movie is absolutely hilarious, with plenty of internal self-reference, tons of classic tropes and cliches (with \\"lampshades hung\\" on them to make it clear that the homage is out of love), and some of the best deadpan deliveries I've seen (though, oddly enough, not from Cera). Wright's expert sense of comic timing shines through here -- I never thought I'd hear an entire audience laughing so hard at a guy pausing to tie his shoe.<br /><br />The comedy only pauses for the fights, which are SO insanely over-the-top that you can't even attempt to take them seriously. Seriously, even for a video game, these are pretty crazy! Just sit back and accept that keyboard riffs can become dragons, that veganism gives you super powers, and that you can hit a guy hard enough to turn him into shiny coins. (Ooh, neat! Power-up!)<br /><br />This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but if the above sounds like a good time to you, you will LOVE it. I already want to see it about a half-dozen more times.
B001JJBO74|3.0|The first part is a 49 page commentary about fine fragrances. The authors discuss the peculiarities involved in writing about a subject as evanescent as fragrance. Then they comment on the feminine and masculine properties of fragrances.     The second part of the book is over 300 pages, and the authors review nearly 1500 different fragrances. The authors assume that the reader already has a lot of experience with fine fragrances. I don't yet know a lot about fine fragrances. I bought this book to learn more about perfumes, and this book was not very helpful. If I just wanted fragrance reviews, I could have just read online blogs. I have since found other books much more helpful in learning about fragrances, particularly The Scent Trail by Celia Lyttelton.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a great collection on Blu-Ray and was worth every penny!  My review is just to say that the Blu-Ray restoration played very well and was significantly clearer than the original DVD presentation (which I own). It plays very nicely on a 52\\" HDTV and even better on smaller HDTV screens. If you love these three films you can buy this restoration version with no reservations about the picture quality.<br /><br />The box set contains numerous interesting specials on the making of the Godfather series as well as footage which had to be removed to reduce the playing time. All this footage is now available with this collection with a description of why each scene was shot, why it was removed and what its place was in the story line. This footage is not in high definition but still very interesting. Many other interesting special features included.
B003O85W3A|2.0|I think the anticipation of something new is what will initially garnish sales of this album. This is music friendly album, which means its an album that will do no harm nor will it over thrill. An album is suppose to deliver something fresh, something new to the table, original, and this album does none of the above. It sounds very similar of other artist that sounded original and fresh when this was introduced. This is just another add-on album of what was covered already. No edge, nothing distinct, and believe it or not an Arcade Fire fan posted that the slower songs have more definition in their sound and that I agree.<br /><br />If you truly want to test a good album is play it through a couple times, see if its cohesive, see if you are skipping to the next track, and see if its one of the first albums in your collection you would play at a later date or if your returning to the artist previous album.If the album still hasn't grabbed your attention, then frankly it just wasn't entirely a good album. Arcade Fire...where is it?
0132350882|5.0|I have been a Java programmer for a couple of years now and while I know I have a good appreciation for OO concepts and their application I wasn't sure whether my code was actually very good - from the perspective of being efficient, easy to read, extendable, manageable etc. This book, written by seasoned, well-respected programmers gave me confidence in some of things I had already being doing, but mostly helped me improve alot of things and learn't quite a few tips for things I wasn't doing in my code.    Not too thick, very readable - I rarely recommend books to colleagues since I find its a bit subjective, but this is probably the 1 programming book that I have read so far that I always recommend.    You won't be sorry you read it, even if you don't learn anything you will perhaps gain confidence in what you are doing.
B0037W68F4|3.0|This album is a refining of MGMT direction as to how they want to define, shape, craft their sound and style. Oh, that last album how can you not love those lushes sounds that pierced through your ears. You heard a part European sounding, part American(from Brooklyn at that) sound that just titillated your ears as you listened.<br /><br />So what happened on this one? Well,it seems MGMT wanted to be sure they stayed rooted as whom they are as an artist. So they stripped some of their experimental sounds to see if they can sharpen their standards.They mellowed out the songs so no grooving on any \\"electric feels\\" on here. Nothing wrong with that. However, they seemed to have forgotten that record companies like something from you in this process of defining who you are...profits.<br /><br />I like the fact they wanted to have a collective album and not to have people choose a particular radio friendly single they may enjoy from their album. They forced people to listen to this album and let the deejays to choose what they like to play.I'm all for artist being an artist. Just choose when the time it is to do so. Carry the wave of incoming fans and give something the people want. You still created the song even if it is a radio friendly, a record company loving song.<br /><br />MGMT gets a pass on this album because I believe they like trying different things with their sound and probably still unclear what sound or what kind of band they are just yet. I really believe they are quite a capable band who you should keep your eyes on.If your a fan feel free to buy the album no matter what MGMT came up with this time around. You're just going have to see and accept that this album wasn't so..\\"....Spectacular.\\"

0393061310|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that this book is dense, somewhat repetitive, and a difficult read. However, I won't be the first to admit that it's also one of the more fascinating reads out there if one is interested in the origin of civilizations, ecological anthropology and why some civilizations became more \\"advanced\\" than others. Diamond is at his best synthesizes great quantities of data, which he does here.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This classic drama far exceeded my expectations!  The cast was superbly chosen and the plot really moved along well.  At first, I thought that I would not enjoy the storyline but I was wonderfully surprised.  This is now at the top of my list along with Jane Austen's classics.  This work is a similar Pride and Prejudice but is much more serious.
0143036556|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's my second Jared Diamond book (after Guns, Germs, and Steel) so I knew  that the book would be dense and slow-reading. However, like the previous book, I found the vast amount  of information fascinating and the \\"moral\\" of the different tales that he tells to be one well worth  paying attention to today. Diamond is not a great writer but a great synthesizer of information.
B002ZG9846|4.0|I thought this was going to be a \\"B\\" Movie, but it is full of surprises. It will deserves the R rating, it is not a kid's movie.    It is a good, popcorn no-brainer movie.
0399156577|4.0|This was an enjoyable and well-written book, as is almost always the case with Nora Roberts. Fiona was an interesting and strong woman, and for the most part very sensible. In the face of potential life-threatening danger she does not insist on walking in the woods alone, she appreciates the efforts her friends make to check in on her and she makes sure that she can protect herself. Of course there are moments when she chafes at the restrictions that are forced on her by the threat, but she never throws a hissy fit about it, unlike most suspense heroines whose lives are threatened by a serial killer.     Simon should have been hard to like: he is rude, obnoxious, surly and argumentative. He dislikes the idea of anything that smacks of commitment to a woman and generally gets in a bad mood anytime his relationship with Fiona takes a deeper step. Despite all this, and in some ways because of this, he is a lovely character. He consistently pushes past his comfort zones to help Fiona, and in his own grumpy way he is charming and even considerate. Although his knee-jerk reaction to the threat against Fiona is to try to take over the situation, there is a constant give-and-take between them and he does stand back and let her protect herself.     I had only one major objection to this book, something that just struck me as anachronistic, and would throw me out of the book every time it happened: The way Fiona and Simon would profile the serial killer. The analysis of the killer's psyche would have seemed perfectly feasible if it had been done by the FBI agents, or even in conversation between Fiona, Simon and the FBI. But the idea that somehow these two lay-people - one a dog-trainer and the other a carpenter/sculptor - were better at profiling both the evil serial killers in this book than the FBI was ludicrous. It makes some sense in Fiona's case - she is a dog trainer and has to analyze both dog and human behavior in that context, so she could just look at the killer asa Bad Dog - but Simon? That was just ridiculous.    (One other tiny quibble was the fact that the killer is called an UNSUB only once in this book - shortly after he was identified! Either don't use the jargon, or use it consistently - don't call him an unknown subject after his name is known)    Apart from these, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the dogs were, of course, adorable.
0061714372|5.0|I first got into Megdeth around 1991. I remember buying \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" the day it came it out in the summer of '92. I've seen them numerous times live & have read countless interviews w/ Dave Mustaine. But here we got all of the information straight from the horse's mouth. It was fascinating to read about his troubled childhood, which led him to substance abuse at an early age. It is very revealing hear his side of the story regarding the early days of Metallica, how he was fired & then began putting together his own, ultimate Metal band - Megadeth. At lot of the interviews never got this in depth, such as why the Rust in Peace era line-up fizzled, how band politics, and the music industry played out in Mustaine's career. This is a fascinating read about a very talented, but troubled person who has struggled for almost his entire life with drugs, success, & keeping a stable line-up for his own dream band. If you are a fan of Megadeth, you will want to read this book! I was barely able to put it down (even though I essentially know how the story goes).

B002ZG97RE|1.0|Once again, Matt Damon is sucking on the teat of liberalism.  The whole movie centers on Bush bashing vs. the faults of American intelligence.  Sure did well in the theaters - not!  Come on Matt - step out of your pampered millionaire lifestyle and see how real America lives!
B003JLA4KS|5.0|An outstanding never before seen insight in to the lives of outstanding musicians and the creation of the greatest band that ever was! Besides a highly interesting close look in to their lives, a nostalgic look from their early (and perhaps) best work.<br /><br />Thanks for bringing this treasure in to all of our lives......the fans!!<br /><br />All the best from Mexico City
1400049628|5.0|I'm not always good at explaining why I like something, so I will keep this short and just say that I have TZSG:CPftLD, and LOVE it.    For some reason I am sincerely terrified of zombies (I have nightmares every time I watch a zombie movie - I do that with no other kind of scary movie), and this book comforts me by making me giggle about them.     I give it several thumbs up, and have given copies out to several of my friends. They each thought I was nuts at first, but every one of them ended up really liking it too.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Finally, a rockumentary on one of the most underrated, least publicized, and successful bands in the world.  If you are a Rush fan, then you already have this and you love it as much as everyone else.  If you are a musician, you will appreciate this story of three (4) Canadian uncompromising geniuses and their struggle to rock the world.  You may laugh, you won't cry (unless you realize that you'll never be as talented as these guys), and you'll certainly enjoy the movie, as well as, the extras...especially the dinner...    A must have for everyone!

B002ZG983M|5.0|The first backlash against the film was, understandably, towards the young female character who talks dirty and likes to shoot people in the head. So, began the long stream of \\"morally reprehensible\\" laden reviews for a generation cultured on media violence to absorb...or not.<br /><br />Kick Ass thoroughly represents America's infatuation with violence, guns, and well...immorality. It's like witnessing a mass shooting firsthand. It's cold, ruthless and unforgiving. There are no redeemable qualities in really any of the characters. We see revenge, greed, and lust but we are not immersed in any heroism.<br /><br />This creates a visceral experience that I am not able to say that I disliked. Indeed, what makes this film so good is it's break from traditional character molds. It does not represent justified killing or a morality tale. It flies in the face of what critics like Roger Ebert look for in a film. That is a literary change portrayed on screen.<br /><br />However, does a lack of such criteria make this less than a film? Does it make it less of a social statement on the culture of violence? Sometimes, a film can succeed in greatness without teaching you something about morality. Sometimes, a film succeeds on it's cold realism alone. Does that make an eleven year old assassin any more realistic? No...but it livens the fact that not everything is traditional peaches n' cream.

Here Lisbeth lies in critical condition in a hospital and faces three murder charges if she recovers. Her recovery will depend on fighting back in this powerful story.
0307474712|5.0|I missed a subway stop because of this book. It's simply a treat to read. You find yourself rooting for these characters from the first page and the more time you spend with them, the more endearing they become. Nicholls is a terrifically talented writer who knows how to tell a great, funny, touching story, which is exactly what he's done in this book.

His knowledge gets him involved in a dangerous murder trial in this tense thriller!

1400032717|1.0|this book tried too hard to attain what all authors know is the holy grail of writing: creating something new. Yet the story is dull, the writing generic and elementary, and the story is cliche. This is the type of book that people who know someone with autism or people who feel they should be sensitive to the issue of autism will read and praise, though it is not a good book.
B002VECLVO|5.0|What a rewarding film this is.  It is wonderfully cast and expertly directed - by first time director Tom Ford who is a self confessed Christopher Isherwood tragic. I really enjoyed the performances of all the cast - Colin Firth was an intriguing presence and 'Malibu' Nicholas Hoult was suitably seductive as the ingenu leading his professor to a gentler death.  He didn't go to bed with the professor, but rather with the professor's .38 revolver.  (So what would his reaction have been on waking the next morning to find his mentor expired? Percussive?) This is a fine film - nominated for two Academy Awards in 2010 - Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|After reading the(at the time of writing this) 4 bad reviews, I felt there needed to be another review that does Flashforward(FF) justice. To those who say the plot was too slow, or characters nearly ruining the show, I honestly have to ask \\"What were you watching? Because it sure wasn't the FF I was watching.\\" FF has it all, action, drama, comedy, romance, mystery, red herrings, beautiful women, and accesible characters who can be seen as the neighbor across the street. The emotions are real and the actions intense. And all of that is before touching on the time-travel-esque part of FF.    For those of us who actually have brains and enjoy using them FF is perfect for you. Some deep scientific ideas are hidden behind the simple black out and see your future idea. Time travel paradoxes are introduced(can't change your destiny and the like) and then a game breaking moment occurs and suddenly choices matter once again.    I have to rate this in the top 5 shows of all time and I am extremely hopeful that the Season 1 finale is not the serries finale because, well, there is so much left to cover, to explore, and to learn. ABC's cancellation of Flashforward can be defined simply and accurately as a trevesty of the highest degree. This show deserves to be picked up by a network who will not decided to throw it out as soon as times get a little rough.    TLDR :: One of the greatest shows of all time with great plot points and a wonderful story line.
B001FB5634|4.0|This is a really bleek film with some harrowing scenes of holocaust survivors reduced to cannibalism to survive.   I think it's great that the producers of the film sought out sympathetic scenes of destruction and desolation (Mt St Helens, etc)rather than resorting to computer graphics.  This placed all of the cast under great pressure - particularly Viggo Mortensen, who is an indomitable spirit - and who undertakes the role of teaching his son - played by Cody Smit-McPhee to survive him, that is, to discover the fire within himself. But for all the transcendental love which Mortensen's character shows, it is clear that he is deluding himself in a sense, for his son is far too vulnerable and too young to fend for himself. The boy is just an albatross around his father's neck, but the father's love will not be extinguished. The son presumably represents an idealised human spirit, and his father will undergo unspeakable hardships to promote the next generation.  What irked me was having to listen to the boy implore his father with the words, \\"Papa, papa\\" far too many times throughout the movie. I understand this is a homage to Cormac McCarthy and his own son, but it really grated.  But for this, an excellent film, far more engaging than Day of the Triffids (!) Recommended
0394401522|5.0|Cooking has always been fun for me, but now I am loving it, because Julia goes to great depth explaining why, you let the eggs come to room temperature before beating, and why you dry off the meat before browning. All questions and steps in cooking that I now know not to skip, because of Julia. Great teaching tool. I love it. If you want to know why you need to do a step, then this is the book for you....You can sit down and read this cookbook like a BOOK. It is amazing. If you don't know about Julia Child, then pick the cookbook   'Julia's Kitchen Wisdom'.  Happy Cooking...
B0018M6J90|5.0|Frances McDormand is outstanding in the title role of Miss Pettigrew ~ and she is surrounded by a wholly satisfying cast.  This film seems to be a real sleeper - made in 2007 and directed by Bharat Nalluri who has some excellent writing and directing credentials for BBC1 TV.  It is such a joyful movie and Ms Pettigrew, who lost a partner to World War I collects another at the outset of World War II.  I was pleased to see British actor Tom Payne in his first feature film - he plays Phil - the self obsessed son of a wealthy impresario,with a great deal of joie de vivre - and just as importantly, he is a singularly handsome young man!
B0036EH3X4|3.0|Lost has been an amazing ride.  It would be hard for me to remember another show that was this interesting and enigmatic (better than Twin Peaks) and that had me so obsessed.  The writing was amazing, the acting was decent most of the time, and the warped up storytelling just made it all the more compelling.  I have to say this is some of the best writing television has ever had... until it had to end.  Ever since season 3 producers have been talking about how the end had been planned since back then and that they weren't just making things up as the went.  The stressed they wouldn't use any trick devices (Deus Ex Machina) promising it wouldn't all turn out to be some sort of dream... so they did the next best things.  SPOILER: Turns out they're deceased.   I personally feel insulted after 100 hours they come this lame conclusion, proving once and for all that Lost got a little to big, a little to wild, and a little to esoteric for them to handle efficiently. So, to me, this is worth getting only if the last episode comes in a separate disk that you can throw away and pretend it just never happened. Fade to black.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|As has become my practice, if I see a book featured that looks intriguing I immediately log on to my iPad and download it. But as I always do I looked at the cost of other editions, confident in the knowledge that the savings in printing and distribution cost translate into a saving for me. But No, in this case I and all others are being ripped off as the dinosaurs at Penguin defend their printing businesses by cross subsidizing them from eBooks.
0307474712|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. Just beautiful. The book as whole is much better than it's concept alone (each chapter is a one day snapshot of Dexter & Emma on the same day each year for 20 years), so if you're hesitant have no fear. This isn't cheesy chick lit or predictable in any rom-com way. Just beautiful.
B0015DROBO|1.0|This is the most boring \\"best seller\\" I've ever read, and the story is very disturbing. Wish I read reviews thoroughly before I bought this book. Waste of money!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy all of the music of Carole King and James Taylor (whom I fondly refer to as \\"JT\\"). This cd/dvd combo pack was priced to sell. The voices of both artists are extremely as they are remembered. The combo pack features all of those song titles that are most familiar to those who grew up in the time when their music was becoming so popular. This was a wonderful purchase and a great keepsake collection of their early music!
1439153663|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to put down, and once I put it down, I didn't want to pick it back up for fear of what was going to happen next to the characters that I liked so much.   If you liked \\"The Help\\", then you will like this book. It's similiar in how the story is told. Only this book contains far more tragedy than comedy. My only disappointment is The Kitchen House didn't end how I wanted it to. I became so caught up in the characters and the many plots taking place that I was rooting for the underdogs and hoping that people really can change. I was engrossed by the life like qualities of the characters and how the characters were all connected to one another by the hardships they endured in their lifetime. The author does a superb job at telling the story, but leaves me yearning to know even more. There are a few unanswered questions that leave you contemplating long after you read the book. I would love to know if Marshall was sexually abused by his tutor. That would explain his lack of intimacy with his future wife. Or was that the result of a non-existent relationship with his mother? If Marshall knew the truth about what happened to his tutor and the truth about Belle sooner, would he have grown to be a better person to those who helped him? What really happened to Lavinia's first fiancee? And of course, there are the many what ifs that I keep pondering over.

B002VPE1PW|5.0|While made specifically for an Amazon Kindle, this sleeve has many uses. Think about what you want protected and whether this would do the job.

B003G94BZC|4.0|I became a huge fan of the new Dr. Who series last year thank to Netflix, so I went through the first 4 seasons pretty quick, yet it seems like a lifetime of adventures. But I remember after watching the first season and falling in love with the show, only to see them change the actor who played the Doctor at the end, well that made me uneasy. I loved the character and the actor who played him, and not they put these other guy in there. Then after a few episodes I forgot about the old Doctor and loved David Tennant. In the words of the Doctor himself, \\"he was brillant!\\". Then 3 epic seasons (and a few great christmas specials) they have to go and kill off the Doctor again. So, once again I was unsure if the show could hold its same glory.    Then comes Matt Smith. A little dorkier than Tennant and a little weirder looking as well. He seems a little more comedic and not as serious. And I don't care for bow ties much. But you know what, he pulls it off. When you first look at him, you may not see the Doctor you once knew, but look closer, and he's there.     Then there is the companions. Amy Pod, a cute little ginger meets the Doctor as a little girl then waits for him for year and years to return. And like many a female companion, she starts to fall for the doctor, only strings her old boyfriend along.     It seems as if they've left out the rest of the older reappearing characters except one, River Song, who we for the first time in the Library. She's had a long history with the Doctor, and hints that she knows his end, and of course we know hers.     As for the shows themselves. Stuck true to the formula that has been working for the past 4 seasons. Individual stories through space and time that are complete on their own, put yet tying everything together for a grand finale that keeps you one the edge of your seat. (Even though you know the doctors going to save the world again.)    If you've liked them up til now, you still going to love this season.
140130916X|4.0|I find it very difficult to believe Ms. Ahern wrote this book at the age of 21. Her understanding of people and how they cope with a tragedy such as young widowhood is astounding. All of the characters in this book are incredibly believable and genuine. Holly is easy to relate to even if you haven't been in her situation and has such an unique voice. The only detail that might reveal the tender age of the author is in the simplicity of her prose, but in a book like this, it reads as well. The message is more important than the words used to convey it.<br />This book goes beyond \\"chick lit\\" to entrance most any reader.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Mr. Sledge's discription of his experiences at Peleliu & Okinawa was so gripping that I felt the emotions he felt.  This book by far is the best I've ever read at putting the reader in battle.  I felt his fear....I was dirty, I was thirsty and I smelled the sickening stench of war.  Well done Marine!
0439206472|4.0|Although I am a person who generally enjoys books with happy endings and happy events, and although I am an adult, and not a child, I found myself enjoying this book immensely. Snicket's style of writing, as if having a conversation with the reader, pausing to impart information in a narrative voice, is quite engaging. I am entranced by the Beaudelaires, and will not rest (figuratively) until I have perused all of Snicket's tales of them.
030745455X|5.0|One must read \\"Dragon-Tattoo\\" before this one otherwise you'll be going...uh?  More linear, grammatically correct then the first book.  I think the best of the three.  This first was twisted plus had multiple story-lines.  Girl Who Played With Fire flows much better and we learn more about Lisbeth which is cool! The ending is a corker.  An amazing book/read/series.  Ms. Salander will kick your arse then go online and cyber crime your bank account if you don't agree.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie is extradinary! Two children caught-up during WWII in Germany. One boy, Jewish, behind fences and in a camp; the other a German boy - both the same age. Neither understands anything that is going on. The German boy thinks the Jewish boy plays games in the camp because his has numbers on his pajamas. The two boys are so innocent. The ending will knock you socks off. You will be crying and yelling out loud \\"No, no, no way\\"!!! I give this movie 5 stars. One of the best, most heart-felt, movies I have ever seen; and believe me, I have seen almost every movie since I was 16 and I'm now 60.  Buy it. You won't regret it. You will definitely learn more about life, people, children, horrible crimes, and the truth about the war.
030726999X|4.0|If you read the Dragon-Tattoo and Fire, you have to finish the trilogy so Hornet's Nest is a must.  It's good but a lot slower then the first two.  I blazed through books 1 & 2 but took my time with this one. The Berger-SMP stalker plot is BORING and has nothing to do with Lisbeth.  Well, okay a little but it's anti-climatic. The ending of Hornet's Nest is slick but sad since you know this it.  That is, unless the \\"ex\\" and family can iron out their differences.
0757302661|2.0|Where to start.. I picked this book up from the library because I liked the meditation prospects of the method. What I really felt was let down. I didn't realize the book was just a textbook for a class. I wish it had said that somewhere on the cover of the book. I didn't like the 50 year old birth horror stories that were trying to get me to believe in what this woman was saying. I didn't like the anti-medical establishment feel to it all.     I didn't agree with the anti-education stance. Why do I not want to learn about my options and make well informed decisions? If doctors really don't know best (and I'm definitely not one to say they do), why DON'T you want to learn about what could go wrong and what the drugs are and whatnot? I hated the preachiness of the book, the weird terminology (like \\"contractions\\" can't be used? if you know anything about the basis of English and language in general, you'll see that's the WORD for it, it's not just some arbitrary word), or the use of \\"normal\\" instead of \\"natural\\", as if those of us who go to a hospital and use some interventions have \\"abnormal\\" births and children.    However, I do like the meditation aspect and wish that you could pick up more of that without having to take costly classes. I like \\"Meditainment\\" and find relaxing with those to be great fun, so I was sure I'd love this method, too. It's just not for me. I'm more open to education and my options than I guess I need to be to really grasp this stuff.
0307454541|5.0|At first I thought, \\"how many pages do I have to slog through before it gets understandable?\\"  But it didn't take long for me to be a believer and I devoured all three of the books.  Plunge in and stick to it and you will love these books.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Okay, I caught Veronica Mars on Netflix and was quickly addicted.  This intelligent, fun show features a great mix of characters and kept me thinking.  In this show, life isn't simple, but it is certainly entertaining and unpredictable.  I haven't been so excited about a show in a long time.  I was so impressed, I purchased this for my sister to watch because I'm sure she'll love it as much as me.  I can't wait for her to watch it so I can watch it all over again.  If you are a fan of mystery, thought provoking story lines with a dash of romance thrown in, you'll like this.  Veronica is a strong female character that chooses to fight back rather than be a victim, and I love that.  I can't get over how this made me laugh, cringe and lean forward with curiousity while I tried to figure it out.  I couldn't stop watching!  You could not be disappointed.  Watch this. . I can't believe I missed it when it was on air.  I'm sad there aren't more seasons.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|the photography of this film is fantastic. And on Blu-Ray you can see every little detail.    Happy this is part of my collection - one more disk yet to view...
B000L212HC|3.0|. . . but it was worth watching once.  If you watch it a second time it will be to figure out the parts that were confusing the first time around.  The film offers an interesting concept, a double-twist of an ending, and an unexpected science fiction angle involving the real life genius Nikola Tesla (he really did wirelessly illuminate bulbs at a distance of 25 miles from his experimental station outside Colorado Springs).  Alas, it is a film chopped to pieces with flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks, particularly in the first half, and too often loses coherence as a result.  It does, however, all come together at the end.  The Prestige isn't a riveting film, but it will keep your attention.  The performances - I didn't recognized David Bowie and was stunned to see his name in the credits - are all worthwhile, especially the venerable Michael Caine, and the blu-ray quality and sound are of high quality.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|I did a lot of research on what to give my nephew as a gift. Finally I found this planet earth and was amazed about the reviews. so I went ahead and bought it. It was truly a good product. It helped to keep my 2 year old nephew quiet at least for a short period of time. Kids like to see animals and birds. It improves their understanding of nature.  The camera work and the narration are extremely good. I haven't yet completely watched the entire series but I liked the portion that I watched. I am sure that this will be better in a Blue ray... Please buy it for your kids and yourself too. It is lot of knowledge.

B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise seemed like a European film by a European director, but it was actually the American Richard Linklater, the director of 1991's Slacker. I have seen one reviewer who said that Before Sunrise could therefore be called Shlakers. That seems a bit harsh, though, for a film this fresh and lovely. Filmed in Vienna, a very old and beautiful city, with plenty of long takes that allow the dialogue to unfold quite naturally, it tells a simple story of 2 young people who meet on a train. Ethan Hawke plays an American student, who goes by the name Jesse though his real name is James--and Julie Delpy is from Paris, like her character, Celine. Though the whole Ethan Hawke persona can sometimes wear on one's nerves, here he manages to be brash, but not impertinent. He is actually quite charming, and Julie Delpy is simply wonderful. They both act well with an extremely natural feel, like you are observing them on that train, and following them around Vienna. You can see that they are falling in love, but they have agreed that they won't pretend they'll ever see each other again. They will just have this one night together.<br /><br />They go so well together, you start to become concerned. Maybe they should get together. Maybe this was fate, this is their only chance at true love. The movie ends on an ambiguous note which I don't want to spoil, but if you want to know what happens to them there is a sequel called Before Sunset that takes up with Julie and Ethan's characters 9 years later.<br /><br />The film has numerous references to James Joyce's novel \\"Ulysses\\" and they both take place on June 16th, which is celebrated as \\"Bloomsday\\" named for main \\"Ulysses\\" character Leopold Bloom. Celine could be a literary allusion as well, to Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line, author of \\"Death on the Installment Plan\\" and \\"Journey to the End of the Night.\\" Jesse quotes W.H. Auden at one point, and you wonder if he might become a writer himself some day. If he does, this chance encounter with Celine could no doubt provide some excellent material.<br /><br />-------------<br />Celine: You know what I want?<br />Jesse: What?<br />Celine: To be kissed.<br />Jesse: Well I can do that.<br />===========<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000JMK6LW A Scanner Darkly]] (2006) Directed by Richard Linklater<br />[[ASIN:B00018U9G6 School of Rock (Widescreen Edition)]] (2003) Directed by Richard Linklater<br />[[ASIN:0783227361 Dazed and Confused]] (1993) Directed by Richard Linklater<br />[[ASIN:B00007JGNJ Slacker]] (1991) Directed by Richard Linklater<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000URDE8S The Hottest State]] (2006) Ethan Hawke was Vince<br />[[ASIN:B003E6H4R4 Snow Falling on Cedars : Widescreen Edition]] (1999) Ethan Hawke was Ishmael Chambers<br />[[ASIN:0767805712 Gattaca]] (1997) Ethan Hawke was Vincent Freeman<br />[[ASIN:0783227922 Reality Bites]] (1994) Ethan Hawke was Troy Dyer<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000BX8R10 Broken Flowers]] (2005) Julie Delpy was Sherry<br />[[ASIN:155890848X An American Werewolf in Paris]] (1997) Julie Delpy was Serafine Pigot<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Jesse: I feel like this is, uh, some dream world we're in, y'know.<br />Celine: Yeah, it's so weird.

B002KS1IJC|5.0|This movie was very good and I am surprised that it didn't do much, much better than it did in the theaters.  The writers did an excellent job adapting the classic Norse story into the science fiction / action genre and there were enough comedic and dramatic moments interspersed throughout to break up the film and prevent the action from seeming gratuitous or becoming monotonous...    Overall and excellent sci-fi / action flick and certainly one worth watching...

B000A2IPPK|5.0|My grandchildren come every year to visit from their home in Italy.  This year they were old enough to watch \\"E.T\\" so we all watched it many times.  It was wonderful for their ages, 3 to 8, and they kept saying afterwards \\"E.T.\\"!!!! Wanting to watch it again. (The youngest did persist in calling him \\"A. T.\\"! but we all knew what she meant.)  This is such an endearing film!  The relationship between the boy and the Extraterrestrial was amazingly portrayed....intimate, touching to the heart of all ages.  Now one of my favorite movies, and as you see, I am a Grammie!
B000127LW2|2.0|Please note: my two-star review is with regard to the overall DVD experience. I recently purchased season one of Star Trek: Voyager, and almost immediately upon opening the set to view when getting home, I realized (again) why I waited so long to start collecting any of the Star Trek series on DVD.<br /><br />For starters, I remember very vividly the days in 2002, 2003 when television series -- both old and new -- were popping out season sets on DVD for roughly $40.00 to $50.00 per season. At the time, that seemed to be the reasonable standard. Paramount in it's infinite wisdom (or would that be greed?) managed to find a way to charge upwards of $150.00 per season for any of the Star Trek sets. And, much as I love Star Trek, I certainly wasn't about to spend that kind of money on any of these sets, and Voyager is the embodiment of that reasoning.<br /><br />The obvious jugular to go for in this case would be the packaging. It's downright atrocious. Flimsy, gaudy, and cheap. Season One is packaged in two, transparent slip cases which are really just ONE slip case that has been halved in the middle. Removing these pieces reveals the translucent, electric orange DVD jewel-case \\"book\\" for the five discs. \\"Book\\" being entirely facetious because upon closer inspection the only thing binding these orange \\"pages\\" together is a piece of transparent packaging tape.<br /><br />The discs themselves are poorly labeled. Where in all previous releases for TOS, TNG and DS9, there were actual labels on the discs and sometimes even episode listings, the Voyager discs instead have the show logo printed and little else. What else there*is* on the disc is printed in so minuscule a font, it might as well not even be there.<br /><br />The first season, consisting of the first sixteen hours of the series (the two-hour pilot telefilm plus fourteen regular episodes) are presented in airdate order (to the best of my recollection). At first the episodes look terrible but I attribute that more to being spoiled by the clarity and wonderful-ness of Blu-Ray on HD televisions. The visual effects still look great and once they finally settled on a hairdo for Janeway, most of the distracting visual elements cease to be distracting.<br /><br />In terms of storytelling and overall quality, I've found that your mileage will vary. Not strictly from episode to episode alone but on the whole. Until reviewing the series on DVD this week, I'd not actually seen most of these episodes in maybe nine or ten years. I fondly recalled \\"Caretaker\\" being a very good first show and that the first year itself had been quite strong and well written. Perhaps it's the passage of time, perhaps my storytelling sensibilities have changed in the intervening years, but the shows didn't seem to 'pop' as much as they once had. Standouts like \\"Heroes & Demons,\\" \\"State of Flux,\\" and \\"Jetrel\\" are anchored down by the mostly mediocre efforts like \\"Emanations\\" and \\"Learning Curve.\\"<br /><br />The special features are nice, and there are a few \\"hidden\\" Easter Egg features as well that are really just minute-long blurbs from various cast and crew members recollecting about some tidbit of trivia from the show's production. A nice touch that could have (and some say SHOULD have) been included --and one that would perhaps justify the hefty pricetag-- would be to include the previous series' introductory episodes to the Maquis conflict -- TNG's \\"Journey's End\\" and \\"Preemptive Strike\\" along with DS9's \\"The Maquis\\" two-parter. Sadly, there's nothing like that on this set.<br /><br />So in conclusion, while some of the stories have aged rather well given how timely and topical they were in the '90s, some have not. And while some of the special features clearly had some forethought and effort expended in to producing them, the physical packaging of this DVD set clearly did not. Overall, I find this set is most certainly not worth some of the more extreme price tags that come attached to it. If you simplymust have it, try to find the set for under $20.00.0.
B001LQCID4|5.0|Tonight I saw the presentation of Metropolis, Fritz Lang's 1927 masterpiece -- many scenes thought lost were re-discovered and put together by Kino Video, which is slated to be released in November 2010.<br /><br />The scenes that were missing were black-streaked since these parts were originally badly damaged.  You can see the difference between these scenes and the cleaned-up, restored scenes.  English subtitles with some of the German language scenes and nice, bright white, easily read fonts graced the screen.<br /><br />What an interesting story!  And so complex!<br /><br />Lessons:  The Machine is All!  The machine must be tended to at all times.  When the workers change shifts they march into work, slow, heads down, laboring, laboring, laboring.  The whistle blows after a ten hour shift.  Then they go below to the underground workers' city deep in the earth.<br /><br />The industrialist brain behind this shiny, bright city is Joh Fredersen.  His son Freder is a playboy who gets his pick of the women at The Club of the Sons.  He's checking out the girls and having a great time until a strange woman comes into the Club with a bunch of ragged children.  \\"These are your brothers\\", she intones.<br /><br />Who was that girl?<br /><br />Freder then explores the inner city and is shocked by the working conditions.  He imagines the machine is a god and that the workers are slaves, sacrificing their bodies and flesh to the maw that is The Machine.<br /><br />Clearly the director is making a statement about where the Industrial Age is heading.<br /><br />But then we get to the Inventor, his plan within a plan.  We discover Maria, a passionate woman who says that the workers (Hands) and the management (Brain) have no way to communicate.  They need a \\"mediator\\".  A Heart.  And she falls in love with that Heart.<br /><br />Amazing tale, insightful, and at times  unintentionally funny -- the scenes with the humanoid made flesh to look like Maria dancing at a club with \\"the upper ten thousand\\" is very humorous -- the prancing, the staring and ogling -- just too much.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  Do get the new release from Kino Video as soon as they release it!<br /><br />Quotable Quotes from Metropolis!<br /><br />*  Freder: It was their hands that built this city of ours, Father. But where do the hands belong in your scheme?<br />Joh Frederson: In their proper place, the depths.<br /><br />*  Maria: There can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator.<br /><br />*  Maria: \\"We shall build a tower that will reach to the stars!\\" Having conceived Babel, yet unable to build it themselves, they had thousands to build it for them.

B002ZG97RE|2.0|Lots of action and pounding drums, but really there's nothing here other than a fictional propaganda to discredit America for going into Iraq and toppling Saddam. If you want a pat on the back for disliking America in Iraq, then yahoo and enjoy. Otherwise don't buy it. I'm not really a fan of Bourne stuff either.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Look, this is a decent, well directed movie about soldiers disarming bombs. But that's it, quite frankly. I don't understand how this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, it's NOT that great.    There's little to no story here. To me, a good film has to have a great story. It's a GOOD film, worth a look most certainly. But Oscar winner? Come on.
B000063DHL|5.0|There was a time when metal was filled with melody and good singing.  Bands played well and put on good shows live, now it seems most of it is all doom , thrash which doesn't do a thing for me. This means that brillaint music like this is not coming out of the radio anymore, but you can still buy great music that truly a step above most metal even.  This disc doesn't have one lesser track on it.  It was the maiden disc that I have enjoyed the most from them.  Songs like 'alexander the great'<br />and others just are perfection in metal hard rock.  Any of this bands first ten cds are pretty good but this one is the best musically probably.  So get maidenized and enjoy the show.
B000E5N684|5.0|I won't go into too many details about the plot of Basic Instinct. Others have done that much better than I could. All I will do is give a synopsis of my favorite scenes.  The characters were spectacular! I loved seeing Sharon Stone heat up the screen in this movie! To think that Meg Ryan, Ellen Barkin, Kim Bassinger and so many other fine actresses all turned down the role of the decade makes me realize how it was fate that had the part get to Stone. Stone, and only Stone could do this part justice! Wow! She was incredible. She carried the movie in my opinion and Douglas played off of her. Don't get me wrong, Douglas did his fair share. He more than carried his weight in the production, but it really was Stone that got things going! Never have I seen such a beautiful display of chemistry on screen.  The Jean Tripplehorne sex scene was absolutely incredible! I know many were turned off by its explicitness, but I feel it conveyed the primal urge that exists between man and woman. Tripplehorne's character acquiesses to the strong male and ends up being dominated by him! (Her Lover/Patient). As Douglas takes Jean Tripplehorne over the couch you realize that you are in for one wild and fantastic storyline!  The ending had/was a twist! I won't go into details and/or ruin it for the reader, but suffice to say that you will be terrified and stunned at how the script ends itself!  Definately a Five-Star rating!    A.

B0030IIYWA|3.0|My family and I hadn't watched this movie in years.  The movie is still great but the DVD skipped in a few places even though it was brand new.  That was disappointing.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Matthew McFadyen's portrayal of Darcy has yet to get the credit it deserves. He was the very living vision of Jane Austen's character. He brought to life the person she described as \\"not having the talent to converse with strangers easily\\". The people who masterfully created this movie understood Jane Austen. McFaydyen made Colin Firth ( Darcy in the BBC version) look two dimensional (not an easy task). Keira Knightley as Elizabeth was inspiring. Watching this movie made you feel as though you were eavesdropping not only on the poetic unfolding of the character's lives, but even their thoughts and emotions. An enjoyable experience.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Paramore album. If you are only getting one, this is the one to get. My favorite song is \\"That's what you get\\".
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This one caught me by surprise. At first, I thought it was too slow, and I began to lose patience with it. But I continued watching, and was so excited with how the plot developed. If you're a fan of English 19th century social structure type of movies, this one will work for you. Even if you've not read Jane Austen's book, the movie tells the story very well.

0767020308|4.0|Whether the Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow was as true to the novel or not....it was just simply more entertaining than this one. And, the characters in this one aren't as likeable. Emma was not someone I was rooting for and I think that's important. I felt like many of the characters were not cast well. But, I did enjoy the movie and would watch it again. This Emma just doesn't have the life to it as the Emma with Gwyneth.
0140143726|1.0|I love this book, one of my favorite all times. So when I saw spanish edition, I thought great for my Mexican wife. This book is not in spanish, seller was nice and tried to send me another copy to get it right, but it was another english copy.<br />This book is not in spanish.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This review refers to Pride and Prejudice: Vol. 1) This is a most bodacious rendering of Jane Austin's classic novel, delightfully performed by a cast perfectly picked with the intention to produce an authentic depiction of life in those times. I have watched it many times with pleasure and expect that I shall do so again in future with equal enjoyment. Highly recommended for anyone who is a romantic at heart and whom not only enjoys a happy ending, but believes that one is required in order to bring such a story to a satisfactory close.
0321701763|4.0|There are things I really liked about this book and things I really didn't like.<br /><br />The primary thing I didn't like was the approach they took to the exercises. For instance in the section on adjusting color in Camera Raw, they tell you specifically (by number) where to move the temperature, tint, exposure, blacks, contrast, clarity, vibrance, and saturation sliders, but there is no discussion as to why these amounts for this image work. This problem goes on throughout the book. I'd say that's a pretty huge weakness.<br /><br />On page 118 there is a pull out box with the headline \\"About layer-comps\\" that has 3 paragraphs talking about how great layer comps are. (It's a way to look at different versions of complicated multi-layer PS file.) But it doesn't tell you how to create one, or even mention that there is a complete discussion of the subject that begins on page 242.<br /><br />But the things I did like make this book worth purchasing. At the end of each section are review questions and answers. The answers are wonderful, brief and to the point. And there are other golden nuggets of information sprinkled throughout the chapters and book. For instance in the section on Working with channels it says, \\"To avoid confusing channels and layers, think of channels as containing an image's color and selection information; think of layers as containing painting and effects.\\" While I knew that intuitively from working with them so much, I could never have explained it so simply.<br /><br />The section on creating paths using the pen tool that starts on page 202 is the best description I have read. I've used the pen tool a lot, and I've been putting too many points in because I didn't really understand it. I dog-eared this section so I can find it quickly. I ended up adding 9 such dog-ears throughout the book.<br /><br />The section on the mixer brush was also very well done, and another area I was not up to speed on. I had been going over to Corel Painter for most of my painting issues, and it looks as though that may not be necessary.<br /><br />So while this book has examples that I didn't find useful, it is worth reading every word because you never know when there will be some wonderful explanation that you hadn't heard. I mean it was written by the people who created Photoshop 'of my painting issues, and it looks as though that may not be necessary.<br /><br />So while this book has examples that I didn't find useful, it is worth reading every word because you never know when there will be some wonderful explanation that you hadn't heard.

0800141660|5.0|While this is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, this movie was done masterfully. I have been very pleased with the recent Austen novels-to-film. This movie sticks as close as possible to the original story, the only major change being a bigger role for the youngest sister. If you love Austen novels, or a good clean romance, you will definitely love this movie.
B003EYVXXW|3.0|Hypatia was a  believer too, she was a pagan. Exactly, why she died is unclear, but it probably was for her pagan beliefs.  Later a myth developed that her death marks the end of the rule of Hellenistic philosophy and a trend into the dark ages. She was not a believer in scientific method, which only came much later.     I found the acting quite wooden. I thought that several characters such as Davus, needed a lot more work.    The actual production is very good, some of the scenes such as the riot scenes by the mob, I thought were good.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|If there is at least ONE concert DVD in your collection it needs to be this one.  I mean with appearances by Bowie?  Crosby & Nash???  The only way this could have been more perfect is if Roger Waters walked out on stage!    However, the quality of the footage is horrible considering the technology for filming in HD has been around for almost a decade.  Sony should be embarrassed this DVD was issued in such a grainy VHS level quality.  I'm somewhat disappointed in David Gilmour allowing this to be published like this as well.  It's obvious this show is a culmination of Gilmour's life's work - why not present it in a more clear fashion?
B00003L2I0|5.0|I dont brag on to many artists but when I have Gilbert O'Sullivans get Down playing in my Jeep it always turns heads even had several people ask me while in the Jeep who sings that,so it tells you this artist apparently left his mark.gilbert might have had only a few hits but its from a much better time than what we have today,and the music was not rehashed but new.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood may be both Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's finest hour in the film biz! This bio-pic about legendary B-Movie icon Ed Wood is marvelously done from every aspect of the craft. The same cannot be said for the real Ed Wood, as you'll learn here that his films where often flimsy and contrived. However, Mr. Wood's life story is highly intriguing; way more so then his body of work. If only they had behind the scenes footage from way back then...Even better we have this film! BUY IT!
B003AWRM9W|1.0|Clint Eastwood is a bounty hunter who is out chasing Bernadette Peters. Let me just say i've seen countless movies and Peters is probably the worst leading actress i've ever heard or seen, her voice is so friggin annoying. Everything is by the books and it seems like Eastwood did this movie as a dare to see if he could actually do something so bad. Way too long to be enjoyed, diffently Clint's worst piece of cinema.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I stumbled upon this item at a retail electronics store (hint: yellow is a big part of it's logo) and asked myself \\"How have I not come across this in my search for a belt clip case for my Nano 5G?\\" I had managed to narrow it down to the iSkin Duo and the DLO ActionJacket, as those seemed to be the best options. I didn't like the look of the ActionJacket and the Duo seemed overpriced, however still seemed like the best fit for what I was looking for: a clear case I can clip to my shorts when I run. Anyway, I had a gift card to the aforementioned retail store and instead of overanalyzing it, I made the purchase and am pleased as punch (except for the fact it was \\"on sale\\" for $23.99).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Hard case protects the Nano (minus click wheel, top & bottom and speaker/mic on back<br />- Very easy to put on and remove the case<br />- Clip actually clips to shorts and keeps case in place while running<br />- Top and bottom are open, which allows you to plug in the Nike+ receiver & access hold button<br />- Clear - you chose the color of your Nano and you still get to see that color with this case on<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Clip doesn't rotate (it looks as though the clip can be removed and reversed, but it doesn't do so easily if it does, as I've attempted to do so. only reason this is a con is because I like to have the headphone jack facing up towards me and have the controls make more sense as I look down to pause, change volume during my run)<br />- If you have bigger fingers (which I don't), I could see it being a little difficult to switch the hold button on/off<br /><br />Note: I haven't used the armband part of it yet, so the functionality of that did not factor into the review. However, the fact that it comes with one (that clips on very nicely and doesn't look too bulky) was definitely a positive factor in the rating.

B000000WA4|3.0|Every generation needs a Magnum Opus, and Smashing Pumpkins delivered the 90's equivalent with their sprawling \\"Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness.\\" Billy Corgan is in full array here, from the squalling guitar and nasally yelp of his vocals, to his unabashed desire to be an ego-crazed rock star, to his undeniable gift as a writer, this double Cd delivered in excess.<br /><br />Problem is, excess is a big part of \\"Mellon Collie.\\" Corgan's ego was jammed in high-gear by this time, and his ability to self edit was completely destroyed. So while you get such brilliant songs as \\"1979,\\" \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" and \\"Zero,\\" you're also left to mull over why anyone thought \\"Ode To No One\\" or Galapagos\\" should have made the cut. And there's also no way to deny that fact that the lesser songs here begin to blend into each other despite Corgan's ambitious wedding of classic rock/heavy metal to 90's grunge style, added to the fact that Corgan's voice becomes sufficiently grating over the album's two-plus hour running time.<br /><br />Essentially, what sounded wild and progressive in 1995 has lost much of its luster 15 years later. The hits (and we need to make special note of the ballad \\"Tonight Tonight\\" here) prove something that may come as a surprise to the band's devotees; with all of Corgan's ambitious high-falutin' concepts (as this album is presented as) and in spite of his tottering hubris (just beginning to hinder him here but incapacitating him since), Smashing Pumpkins were at their best when they were a singles band. Really, you can by the Greatest Hits CD and be just as well served as getting any SP full length.
B0034G4OU4|5.0|Making the movie of Eat Pray Love must have been daunting.  How can a journey of self-discovery make an interesting film, even if it is set in three of the most amazing places on the planet?<br /><br />Somehow it works seamlessly.  Eat Pray Love is a gorgeous film. It's funny and poignant and mesmerizing and moving, and it's restored my faith in movies. The filmmakers took a few liberties with Gilbert's book in the interest of pacing and story and the changes made it better.<br /><br />Casting Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert was brilliant. Though we never forget we're watching Julia Roberts, in much the same way Bette Davis and Joan Crawford dominated their roles, she manages to be endearing and believable as she flounders in the wreckage of her life and tries to figure out what's next.  The amazing thing is that the effort behind her progress from depression to joy never shows.  It's demonstrated in subtle ways--roars of laughter at a still-frozen Thanksgiving turkey, pangs of memory and release of pain evoked by a wedding, mischievous glee at giving up her \\"I'm in silence\\" badge at the ashram. Julia Roberts' Elizabeth Gilbert is likeable and charming and her internal journey is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />I liked the book, Eat Pray Love for the travel and the characters, but thought the self-discovery was a 'meh'--yet another spoiled baby-boomer dissatisfied with a life far better than that of 99.9% of the rest of the world who spent 400 pages and a year in the most amazing places on earth crying, \\"Me me me\\". I didn't like Elizabeth Gilbert very much and didn't totally buy a lot of the internal story, though I lapped up the tales of her experiences and the people she met on her travels.  Thanks to a really fine screenplay, we see the point to Eat Pray Love in a way that was sometime obscured in the book.  Thanks to a really fine cast, the supporting characters are just that, from Billy Crudup as Gilbert's hurt and bewildered ex-husband, James Franco as the actor who introduces Gilbert to meditation and Viola Davis as the best friend and sounding board.  Gilbert's circle of people in each of the three places she visits are pitch-perfect and never succumb to stereotype.  It should be noted that Richard Jenkins comes close to stealing the movie in India, as he exhorts Gilbert with AA-like fervor, variations of \\"It works if you work it\\" and \\"keep coming back\\" that mask regret and heartbreak. The scenes with him are some of the best in the movie, though there's not a weak link in the cast.<br /><br />Even if you hated the book, Eat Pray Love is worth seeing as an example of a truly well-made movie with an exceptional cast--and be prepared to crave pizza margherita for days afterwards.s Gilbert to meditation and Viola Davis as the best friend and sounding board.

B002GJU54E|5.0|Another great one from Janet Evanovich.  Makes me want to go to the Pine Barrens and find that Jersey Devil.
0385341008|5.0|The entire book is written in the form of letters the characters write to each other. Brilliant! Very engrossing and when's the last time you read a good book with a happy ending?? I highly recommend this book.

B000002HMH|1.0|For me, this album signaled the end of an era. When I heard this album, I knew metal was dead and was never coming back. When it became clear that instead of leading a new metal revolution Metallica had decided to follow the alternative trend, I was truly hurt beyond words. Only Metallica had the chops and the street-cred to revive metal at that time and they made a conscious choice not to. Instead, they sounded and looked (in their videos) as if they desperately wanted to be Nirvana. For those of us who supported Metallica in the 80s when they were a no-compromise-at-any-price band, this album was like a physical wound. I will never forgive them.

B00005JNEI|3.0|but it's still a nicely done propaganda piece for leftist Moore. I saw this movie twice, maybe two weeks apart, in September 2004. I loved it, mostly because I was very liberal at the time.<br /><br />Moore claims that the Bush family's many connections enabled W to steal the election from Gore. The Bush family had dealings with prominent Saudi families, not limited to the weapons sales during the 80's. Bin Laden is Saudi, but resided with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Bush invaded Afghanistan after they attacked us, but since he couldn't or wouldn't capture Bin Laden, he decided to inflict more fear on the American people. So, it's off to make war on Iraq, and when soldiers become disillusioned and don't re-enlist, Bush pulls new recruits from the poor and minority communities. Naturally, Moore uses this to advertise his adopted hometown of Flint, Michigan.<br /><br />It's been six years, and I rented this documentary from my library. I'd just seen and reviewed 2004's Michael Moore Hates America, and thought it'd be good to revisit Fahrenheit 9/11. I'm conservative now, but I still give Moore credit for creating this piece. He knows how to put together a propaganda piece. He interviews the right people, gets the right footage, the right music and edits them to prove his point. He's a droll narrator, too.<br /><br />BUT, it's been six years. I think most people who would want this DVD already own it. If you like collecting propaganda pieces from the all sides of the American politcal spectrum, add this one to your collection. Moore, like him or not, will be an important face in pop culture history.
0151001820|5.0|Okay, as a fair note, I wrote a review of this book once already, but the feedback I received was less than welcoming. In fact, I found that I was insulted and called me a liar more than the actual book was discussed. So, in the spirit of others whining when their own intelligence is brought into question, I'll focus completely on the book.<br /><br />If you want to try to read The Club Dumas you'll need to keep a few things in mind:<br /><br />1. Don't expect the same plot as The Ninth Gate movie (Johnny Depp). Although it has some amazing similarities to some of the scenes in the book, the movie does essentially cut out half of the plot by twisting it into a single storyline.  This may make the movie seem a great deal more congruous with the primary and most enthralling aspect of the book, part of the thrill of the literary version is the philosophy that not everything's connected, even when we believe that unbelievable circumstances must be tied together somehow.<br /><br />2. If you can get past the first chapter and still be excited by the back-and-forth banter of the characters, then you can enjoy this book. If you feel that it's too college-lecture-style communication, this may not be the book for you. If you like the higher-intellect treasure hunt mystery theme in your literature works, this will be a fun book for you and you'll discover that you can't put it down.<br /><br />3. Many feel the ending is anticlimactic and a letdown.  I wouldn't dare state that they are wrong. After all, if you're unsatisfied with the ending of a story, then that means it was disappointing. But keep in mind, not all stories are linear. When was the last time that a big event in your own life only involved a single, linear tale with a clear-cut ending with all the loose ends tied up? I find it disappointing that people are such shallow readers nowadays that they can't let an unclear ending be the end of a tale. I know that I still have no idea what the outcome of many things in my own life have left me feeling unfinished, yet those events are gone and past. The point of this book is not to tell you a tale from beginning to end, but to share a series of events that defines one man's life and metamorphosis into a different person.  How a single book and a manuscript can change everything in a matter of days.<br /><br />4. One of the characters I keep seeing in the various reviews on this book as being superfluous and unnecessary or confusing; Corso's female companion. Her identity and purpose is quite clear and she states it multiple times, there's plenty of symbology and, yes, you are supposed to take it for what it appears on the surface. Her character's not a complicated one, yet people seem to want to overcomplicate her into a pointless aspect or oversimplify her into a sex interest. She is neither. She is who she states she is and who she is insinuated to be.<br /><br />I find a bit of insult when people start reviewing a book poorly simply because they don't understand it. Just because you don't understand a literary piece doesn't mean it's bad.  For example, I can't understand Old English script at all, yet I'm not about to go review Shakespeare's Hamlet and say it's terrible because I \\"didn't get it\\", which I've noticed most of the Low Rating Reviews of this book has done. How would you like it if someone came up to you in a public place and told you that something you worked thousands of hours on was absolutely terrible because they couldn't fathom your deeper meanings?  I just don't like trying to sift through a bunch of poorly written reviews just to find a worthwhile assessment when considering whether or not to invest dozens of hours into a book I've never read before.  Please, if you don't get it, don't pollute the review stand.<br /><br />I personally loved this book and though it isn't as clean cut as other novels, it is surprisingly realistic to the natural process of life and the unknown directions it can take you. You maythink just because strange things in a sequence happen in similar ways, that they must be connected, but how often is this actually the case in reality? Almost never. It is because of this that I didn't feel let down by the conclusion of the book. If you understand and are okay with this concept, you will absolutely love this book, especially if you love back-and-forth smart-ass banter that's surprisingly humorous and sarcastic.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. Please do not reply with insults. I don't enjoy having my work torn apart because it didn't answer your every question. If you'd like to discuss something I left out, then approach it like a discussion, please. Thank you for your consideration.n in similar ways, that they must be connected, but how often is this actually the case in reality? Almost never.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I grew up with the original Star Trek series in the 1970's as it became popular through syndication. I was a huge fan of the show and could name all of the episodes as well as tell you about each. Over the years, though, other interests replaced my enthusiasm for Star Trek, but now I have rediscovered the thrill of the original series through this remastered edition on DVD. The new special effects do not detract form the show at all. They are tastefully done and in a style that compliments the look and feel of the show. In my opinion they have improved the show and given the original Star Trek new life.    There have been some reviews that criticize the disks for not having labels on them. This is true, but there is a set of cards that come with each box that lists the contents of each disc, so I don't see an issue with not having a label printed on each disc itself.    Other reviews have stated concerns that the case this DVD collection comes in is flimsy. I have to let you know that I accidentally dropped the case full of it's entire contents, from a height of about 5 feet onto a carpeted surface and it wasn't damaged at all, so I think the packaging for these remastered sets is sturdier than some people may think.    I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to relive the magic of the original series.
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Not your typical period movie.  I thought is was a contemporary movie about this romantic couple in history.  It motivated me to look up the diary of Queen Victoria -- an amazing character, before, during and after Prince Albert.

By the time Jake Sully is accepted by the Na'vi, I was hooked.  It is a GREAT story and I could watch it over and over again.  I plan to own the movie soon and watch it often.  That is the greatest praise I can give this magnificent cinematic fete.

I know own both season I and season 2, and I can't get enough.  This gritty, outlaw tale of real characters has captured my heart.  I am a 54 year-old grandma who still lives a young and adventurous life -- if only voyeuristicly.  I hope you will try it and decide for yourself -- I think it has something to offer anyone (over the age of  18).

0312370849|3.0|Set in France during WWII and paralleled in the present, the book follows a journalist as she researches how the French government (and civilians) followed German demands to round up Jews living in Paris to send to death camps.  The story is well written, starkly riveting and heartbreaking, especially since it's based on true events.  I finished it with a sad ache of emptiness, however.  Even though a major theme is the main character's attempts to somehow make restitution, there is little hope or redemption in the story, and I couldn't help thinking that the author needs the hope and peace of Christ to be able to cope with the brutal sinfulness of humanity.  Still, we can't forget history, or we're doomed to repeat it, and some stories are just too awful to have a neat sense of closure at the end.
B001CVCBLM|5.0|You know, I have no idea why I bought this a couple years back. The first time I listened to this I was confused.  The second time I was hooked and this release has become one of my top ten releases of all time up there with the likes of Slayer, Motorhead, Maiden, Accept, Cannibal Corpse, Megadeth, Mercyful Fate, Voi Vod and Saxon.  (Yes, I am a metalhead but Mogwai's \\"The Hawk Is Howling\\" is something real special.) \\"Listen to it on a snowy day, it captures the mood.\\"
0783225857|3.0|I was taken back by how slow moving this movie was.  I believe due to how old this is that we have little tolerance for something that plods along like this did.  In its time it was obviously cutting edge due to the content.  I found the children very annoying during most of the first half of the movie.  The only parts that I truly enjoyed were when it got to the trial and from then on to the end.  I can see why Gregory Peck won an award but the movie as a whole was very, very slow.
B003JJA59K|2.0|The worst part of the story is leaving the bunker with all that food so you can sleep in the friggin rain...yea I would do that in a sec...wow!    It not really worth the rent at all maybe $1 just to see if you personally like it but its really a terrible story.
B003498SDA|5.0|this is one of my very favorite films. i'm an english prof and even teach it in my film classes. but the blu-ray just isn't noticeably better than the already really fine transfer from the previous release. so there's no reason to spend more for blu ray. I have solid reports that the same is true with the blu-ray release of Heat.
B000003N89|5.0|I'm a die-hard fan, but this is a CD I had skipped buying because it's a tribute CD.  I figured the sound couldn't be that fresh, and I couldn't have been more wrong.  From \\"An Errand Girl for Rhythm\\" on, the music flows as naturally as if it was created for DK to perform.  I've found I listen to this set more than any other set she has done, and I have about a dozen of hers ripped to my MP3 player.  All around, great set of music that you'll listen to a lot.
0061703087|4.0|An excellent sci-fi that holds your attention. I wonder why this book hasn't been made into a movie...

B0037A4ILC|5.0|I am not a climber but wow! This film kept me at the edge of my seat. Beautiful scenes and filmed very, very well. This is a must see. Two Mountain Climbers set out to set a record along with the competition in 1936. The scenary was breathtaking as were the climbing scenes. Very well made. This film is in GERMAN just to let you know. Highly recommended!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I really love this movie as a kid. This is one of the best movies ever based on a book from Stephen King. The story is just great, the kids are playing really convincing and the other actors were also great. This movie still gives me huge youth sentiment as I watch it.<br /><br />I think the first part of the movie was the best, were they are attacked by the monster and attack it back. The middle part was also good, but not as good as the first part. A lot of this actors who play the children are just amazingly convincing. The adults also play good, but not superb. The clown then again was just amazing, I don't think anyone could have played it more scarring. This clown also was a character I frequently saw again while having nightmares in my teenage years.<br /><br />I would have given this movie 5 stars, but because of the ending (which was pretty weak to say the least) I give it 4 stars.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I finished this, the last of the Trilogy and the book did not disappoint. I was totally engrossed in the book and could barely put it down. Just when you think you have reached the end there is more. I love the characters and wish there could be more to this series but unfortunately the author, Stieg Larrson has passed away and cannot continue on with this wonderful journey he has begun. I totally recommend all three books in this Trilogy but also recommend you start with the first book so that you can get acquainted with and really enjoy all the characters.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|I was always a fan of Sia, but with this album I am hooked for life. She can do no wrong in my eyes as of now. Every song is packed with spunky lyrics and it is almost GUARATEED to brighten up your day.   I dare you to sit through \\"Clap Your Hands\\", \\"You've Changed\\", or \\"The Fight\\" without tapping your foot or just straight up rocking out to it. One day at work I literally got up out of my chair and broke it down right there. I got some looks but they got me after they heard the song for five times on a loop. LOVE IT. BUY THIS CD.
0061353248|1.0|This is a case where the people marketing the book have done a better job than the writer. Other reviewers have nailed it. It's a series of experiments explained which makes it tedious to read. I found myself arguing with the statistics (as mentioned in another review, the differences often seem to be statistically insignificant) and some of them were just plain based on bad math. The difference between 56 and 65 out of a population of 100 isn't 20%. His conclusions are often specious at best. I was typically able to think of at least a couple of other explanations off the top of my head for the data he was looking at. He started out with a premise and forced the data to fit the conclusions he had already made prior to the experiment starting. That's very poor science. This book is a waste of time and money.
0060171928|5.0|After reading this book once, in record time, I got right on Amazon to purchase my own copy to lend out to my friends/loved ones.  Highly recommended!
B0019WQIPE|5.0|This film is very special - the music is superb, the story is true and the actors are perfect for the parts they play.  I was hoping to have the sound track in Spanish but am happy to simply have been able to replace the film I gave away.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I have watched both versions and this is by far the best.  It may not have the high-powered stars of the 2010 version but it has more laughs.  You will want to watch it over and over because there is so much going on you will find new laughs with each viewing.  It is one of those movies that becomes an old friend.  Frank Oz (Sesame St. fame) is behind the camera and makes a highly believable movie even though the laughs are over the top.  A must-see film bound to be a cult classic.  In fact, I just watched the remake and feel like pulling this one out of the cabinet and watching it right now.
030726999X|1.0|I was a HUGE fan of the first 2 books in this series.  However, this third one just never took off for me.  There were so many characters and background information that it was very confusing.  I even printed out a character list to try to get more into the book.  I was very dissappointed.

B001BJ690Y|5.0|Needless to say, this is an excellent film.  Highly rated by all.  The Blu Ray edition is excellent.  Great visuals and clarity.  Outstanding sound.  Is it night and day when compared to ordinary DVD, no, but certainly worth the additional investment.  The sound quality improvements alone make this version an excellent choice.  The price can't be beat.
142312166X|5.0|I'm a Percy Jackson Nut and I wouldn't feel right if I didn't have every Percy Jackson book.  this was cool book.  I liked the three short stories it contained, they all made me laugh.  I liked the illustrations and especially the camp.  Basically this book was just elaborating Percy Jackson.  All in all it was a fun read and a must if you Percy Jackson.
0439023483|5.0|I just finished this book, and it was absolutely amazing.  I wasn't sure that I would like it because I'm not always into dystopic books, but this book had action, romance, and challenged my thinking and reasoning as well.<br /><br />I think that the main character, Katniss, has a well-developed personality.  She is strong, but not all tomboy.  I also love that she has flaws.  She makes bad judgments of both situations and people, but she never lets her failures disable her.  I wish that there was more about her friend Gale- perhaps that comes in book two.<br /><br />This is a must read for everyone who enjoys reading, and, like Harry Potter, I would expect that even aliterate people would get something out of this book.  I have book two coming from the library in a few days, and needless to say, I can't wait!  I have heard that book two has a serious cliffhanger at the end, though!  I give this book 5 stars.
0439023483|5.0|This is the ultimate Don't-put-down-until-you're-finished book.  From the word go, I was hooked.  It takes place in America centuries from now.  Welcome to a place where there are twelve districts, where reputation is everything, and where for entertainment people are forced to kill each other.  It sounds brutal.  It is.  Katniss Evergreen is the main character and she's not just some girl.  She lives in District Twelve.  District Twelve is poorest and most looked down on district there is.  It's not easy to live there.  There's no work, hence no way to get food.  But not for Katniss.  She's the ultimate rebel.  The district is supposed to be surrounded by an electric fence.  Lucky for her she can get in and hunt.  Katniss will do anything to care for her family since her father died.  In the end, it seems she doesn't succeed.  The Hunger Games is something of a punishment to the entire country, as well as a threat.  The capital, Panem, means to show that they have the power through the games.  From every district two are chosen, a male and female to participate in the Hunger Games.  The object: Kill everyone and be the only one to survive.  If you win, you live the life of luxury afterwards.  Some of the districts youth train for the Hunger Games their entire life.  These districts are the richest among all the others.District Twelve receives no training whatsoever.  This years female chosen: Katniss' little sister.  Katniss immediately volunteers and goes instead of her younger sister.  The male chosen from district Twelve is someone who once saved Katniss' life.  District twelve has been the joke of the games for years.  But Katniss refuses to give up.  Even before the games she defies the capital and breaks rules.  During the games she stays out of the way and lays low.  but eventually she'll have to come out.    Katniss Everdeen is a character that you can't help but adore.  She's independent, hardworking, and big hearted even if she won't admit it.  She's nota crowd favorite in the book, but that's the way she wants it.  She's one of those characters that proves one person really can make a difference.      I loved the book.  It's a novel that is surprisingly realistic.  To this book I can honestly say, I felt like I was there.  The author is truly talented and I expect to see many more great things from her.  I can only that I highly recommend this book to all.  That's the least I can say other than, if you're reading to get a feel for the book, I'm surprised you haven't yet read it.
0307454541|5.0|The first of his three novels and what an entry into a great crime novel.  Outstanding!
B000AARKOO|5.0|good action movie about the end of the crusade to the holy lands. Good cast.
0590030299|5.0|The little boy who received this book loved it so much.  It took a couple of weeks for it to arrive from the time I ordered it, but the child didn't know any better.  he was happy.  I am too.  The seller was gracious-bookseller72135-and e-mailed me about the shipping time right after I ordered.  All in all happy people every where.
0060558121|3.0|Thre are a lot of interesting ideas presented here, but there seem to be few rules governing the world he's created.  Because almost anything can happen at any time -- eg. the dead randomly spring back to life -- there is nothing at stake and it feels like a self-indulgent exercise.  If you're a Gaiman fan, I recommend it, but his editor should have reined him in and helped him produce a shorter, more coherent and unified novel.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|When I read the first three chapters, I was tempted to just skip the rest of the work and avoid downloading it. Some of the concepts presented by the authors challenge \\"conventional knowledge\\". Due to the fact that the chapters are well written and structured, I decided to keep reading. I do not agree with the entire content of this work. However, it makes you reflect on the authors' experience and how you should question some of your old \\"mantras\\". Overall it is a good book and I do recommend it.
0385737424|4.0|It's 1979, and Miranda received her last \\"proof\\" today: Her mom will be on The 20,000 Pyramid in April.  Between practicing for the speed round and the Winner's Circle with the egg timer, Miranda walks to her 6th  grade class through her New York City neighborhood with her best friend, Sal. They know where to get donuts, what deli is best, and how to avoid the scary homeless man on the corner. But when Sal gets punched by the corner bully for no apparent reason, it sets off a string of events that turn Miranda's world upside down. Sal refuses to see her, her hidden apartment key is stolen, and she receives a series of cryptic notes, from which she learns someone is coming, and a friend's life is in danger.    I'd heard some buzz about When You Reach Me before it won the Newbery Medal this year and have had it on my TBR list since.  Although I don't read many books for junior readers, Miranda is a mature protagonist, and all her friends - adult and child alike - are so likable it's hard not to connect with them.  They all had their flaws, strengths, and insecurities, and you're rooting for them. Hoping Miranda's mom will find a job she likes, that her mom's boyfriend Richard will get a house key, that Sal will talk to Miranda, that Annemarie and Julia will be friends again, that Jimmy will let them work at the deli, and that Marcus will learn to time travel someday.  With the simplicity and beauty of the writing and the intriguing puzzle-centered plot, it turned out to be the perfect book to rescue me from my reading slump.  I'm not sure how I missed that Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time features prominently in the book as Miranda's constant companion. Reading that classic for the first time in grade school will always be one of my most memorable reading experiences. I can still see the first image I constructed of the garden and Meg and her father as I read. A part of me expected more shocking twists or self-aware profound thoughts, but Rebecca Steed's metaphors are subtle and sparse. One of my favorite passages:        \\"But sometimes our veils are pushed away for a few moments, like there's a wind blowing it from our faces. And when the veil lifts, we can see the world as it really is, just for those few seconds before it settles down again.  We see all the beauty, and cruelty, and sadness, and love.        ...        I've thought a lot about these veils. I wonder if, every once in awhile, someone is born without one. Someone who sees the big stuff all the time. Like maybe you.\\"    I devoured this book in a day. I was driven by a need to know which friend of Miranda's was in danger, and if she'd make friends, and who the note-writer was, and how the Fred Flintstone bank, the lost key, Richard's heeled shoe, and the crazy homeless man fit together.  Overall a sweet, deeply meaningful coming-of-age story with a little bit of history, adventure, and layman science fiction, something I'd want my son to read when he grows up.
0743277708|5.0|The title of my review says it all. This book was read aloud to my Grade 5 class by our teacher and it had a wonderfully powerful inspirational effect on all of us. I read it to my son nightly. Everyone should have this book read to them.

B003L20IDS|5.0|You'd have to be some sort of bitter, repressed twerp to hate this movie. There, I've said it. Bitter, repressed twerp please queue on the left to snark at me.    Scott Pilgrim VS the World is a delightful, enjoyable movie based on a series of graphic novels. It tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a twenty-two-year-old slacker living with a gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), in Toronto. The most notable thing is his life currently is that he's in a band (\\"We're terrible,\\" he says of it), called Sex Bob-omb (only funny to certain people), and he's recently started dating a seventeen-year-old girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is, to put it mildly, somewhat disconnected from reality and is, for example, surprised to hear that movies are sometimes made in Toronto (for the record it was nice to finally see one both filmed and set there, though I wish they'd filmed it in Hollywood and claimed it was Toronto).    His precious little life begins to change when he dreams about a girl named Romona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and then runs into her at a library. He later finds her at a party, totally fails to hook up with her and eventually meets her by ordering from Amazon, for whom she does deliveries. The two start to bond and soon begin dating. Scott's quite happy with this arrangement until he finds out about Romona's seven evil exes, each of whom is determined to fight to the death for her!    I flat loved this movie! Everything about it worked for me. The casting, especially Cera and Culkin, was dead-perfect from what I've read of the books (only the first two so far, but I'm working on it!). The exes were all entertaining and, oh, dear, was there ever plenty of nice eye-candy to oogle, from Young Neil, to Wallace to the Twins! I do believe I'm having an attack of the vapors! *fans self*    The visual style is wonderful! Everything pops quite nicely and the anime/comic style graphics and captions work out really well, when they could've just been acheesy distraction. The direction by Edgar Wright (best known for Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), really brings together this admittedly strange world and, happily, doesn't lose control of things.    The movie is a bit niche in some ways. Really anyone born before the NES era will be scratching their head and going, \\"What? What? Elwood, see if that new Jimmy Stewart film is playing in the other cinema!\\" But for those of us who grew up on the things showcased in this movie (like the NES, Sega and the Smashing Pumpkins), will have a great time! Easily the best movie of the summer.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I was always a mild Band Of Horses fan. A friend of mine burned me the first two cds to listen to, and I always kind of liked them. The combination of hipster indie rock and the classic country-fied rock was very pleasing to listen to, but that was about all. I did enjoy Cease To Begin a lot, though, since the hipster elements had diminished some, and they were embracing country and Gram Parsons a little more. All in all, I kinda dismissed them as yet another indie band with nothing much to say.<br /><br />That all changed with this album.<br /><br />With Infinite Arms, the Band of Horses lets their hair down and wears all of their influences on their sleeves. A tighter lineup this time around, everyone is contributing to Ben Bridwell's timeless sound. Cease To Begin was the blueprint for this album, as it showed more confidence and cohesion in their songwriting, yet I always knew they were destined for greatness. With Infinite Arms, the greatness is reached. The indie schtick is basically over, now the band is a true rock and roll band with some fantastic 3-part harmony and a penchant for killer melodies and catchy hooks to boot.<br /><br />The album begins with the 3-strike punch of Factory, Compliments, and Laredo. These are easily some of the best work the band has ever done, and at the same time, are vastly different from each other. Factory is a moving ballad about love in the office with some soaring strings. Compliments is a great alternative country rocker with some fantastic harmonies, and Laredo could very well be the road rock song of 2010.<br /><br />Unlike their last 2 albums, the middle half doesn't sag at all. It contains some of the most beautiful work the band has penned, whether it's the haunting title track, the sparse Evening Kitchen (which the guitarist Tyler Ramsey penned) or the Wilco-esque Dilly.<br /><br />This also sees the keyboardist Ryan Monroe coming into play with one of the best songs on the album, Older, a song Gram Parsons wished he wrote. Once again, the harmonies are irresistible. And then, to top it off, the band finishes the album with Neighbor, an epic rock closer if there ever was one. The last 2 minutes of the song where the floodgates open are some of the best 2 minutes you'll ever hear.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album from a band I kinda dismissed earlier. Just goes to show you that you can't judge a book by it's cover.irresistible. And then, to top it off, the band finishes the album with Neighbor, an epic rock closer if there ever was one.

B002P7UCMC|2.0|I really enjoy the music in itself. But once we looked up what they are actually saying, I wasn't impressed at all. Why would anyone want to sing about rape, violence, and those kinds of things.<br /><br />Maybe they could consider making an album with their kind of music with better lyrics, I bet they would sell more albums. I hear the same opinion from alot of people.
B003L7DK74|4.0|Where to begin here? HBO released the first season  of this histercally funny show a while back. Then they released the Complete SECOND season.  Finally (well, almost) they released a package with both Seasons 1 AND 2 and added a CD of some of the soundtrack.  Well this time they have repackaged it AGAIN, replacing the Cd with \\"new to DVD\\" disc of their American TV debutin 2005  for HBO's One Night Stand  special. The special is just 25 minutes and has Bret and Jermaine on stage with their guitars singing song which never would have fit in the TV episodes because of length. The first one takes nearly nine minutes. Some are funnier than others - as you can tell from the live audience reaction - but its still fun to watch.<br /><br />There are many other reviews out there about each of the two seasons and I agree (with most of them) in that Season One is more consistently funny than Season Two (but there are great moments in Season Two). I think this is the case with most TV series. The best ideas come in the first season. I've given this set four stars based on this.<br /><br />Whether you need this set depends on whether you already have either (or both) of the previous packagings. The One Night Stand is for completists. And, if you've not seen ANY of the shows, this package might be an option.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
0307454541|1.0|With all the hype this series has gotten I expected a good read. Now I wish I had passed it over. This book is very violent with crimes against women described in graphic detail and sexual encounters that felt seedy rather than natural in any way. Don't get me wrong I'm no prude but this book rubbed me the wrong way and felt like it was written by someone who gave this type of violence too much thought. Some of the violence just seemed gratuitous and not even necessary to the story. The who-dunnit was obvious and left too long of a journey to get there. It took me forever to finish this book because I kept getting bored because it moved slowly or had too much detail where less would have sufficed or I was turned off by the violence. I had to buy the audio version to get through this book so I could discuss it's merits or lack there of at my book club. This novel has more shock value than literary value. Don't waste your time or money.
0596805888|5.0|The typical geek doesn't just want something to work.  They want to know *why* and *how* it works.  If your geekness extends to the kitchen, this book is perfect... Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food by Jeff Potter.  It's a wonderful mix of science and hands-on activities, and definitely opened my eyes as to why things work as they do in the kitchen.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Hello, Kitchen!: Think Like a Hacker; Cooking for One; Cooking for Others<br />Initializing the Kitchen: Approaching the Kitchen; Kitchen Equipment; Kitchen Organization<br />Choosing Your Inputs - Flavors and Ingredients: Smell + Taste = Flavor; Tastes - Bitter, Salty, Sweet, Umami, Others; Adapt and Experiment Method; Regional/Traditional Method; Seasonal Method; Analytical Method<br />Time and Temperature - Cooking's Primary Variables: Cooked = Time * Temperature; Foodborne Illness and Staying Safe; Key Temperatures in Cooking<br />Air - Baking's Key Variable: Gluten; Biological Leaveners; Chemical Leaveners; Mechanical Leaveners<br />Playing with Chemicals: Traditional Cooking Chemicals; Modern Industrial Chemicals<br />Fun with Hardware: Sous Vide Cooking; Commercial Hardware and Techniques<br />Appendix; Afterword; Index<br /><br />There's just so fun stuff here, it's hard to know where to start.  Potter does an excellent job in explaining the science behind what happens when you mix the eggs, flour, and milk together and apply heat.  While most books on cooking tell you *what* to do, this one goes into the *why* and *how*.  For instance, why does heat change food, and how does that happen?  What is involved in protein denaturation, the maillard reaction, and caramelization?  And why does knowing all this make a difference to you when it comes to knowing when a particular item is \\"done cooking\\"?  It's this type of information that takes you beyond saying \\"but I left it in for the 10 minutes they said... why wasn't it cooked?\\"  After reading Cooking for Geeks, you can start to understand what's going on within the food, and make educated decisions about what happened, what is happening, and what will happen next.<br /><br />Fortunately, Cooking for Geeks isn't just a chemistry manual though.  It's full of actual recipes that look delicious, as well as interviews with other cooks who reveal some of their secrets and mindsets behind what they do in the kitchen.  Again, it all serves to take you beyond the \\"follow steps 1, 2, and 3\\" method of cooking, into something that is creative and fun.<br /><br />This is like reading a season's worth of Alton Brown's Good Eats shows.  Plenty of fun and very informational... and you can eat or toss your mistakes. :)<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Publisher<br />Payment: Freehe food, and make educated decisions about what happened, what is happening, and what will happen next.

B0031Y4ALC|5.0|i used to listen to this on cassette when it first came out, then i lost interest for about 20 years. now i am listening again, and really playing it a lot. i read somewhere that this is the first time on vinyl, but i don't think it's true, because i can find references to the original vinyl copy- Elektra 60855, 1989.
0061120081|5.0|I just finished the book today. I have read some of the reviews others have left for it and will not try to echo their excellent reviews of this wonderful book. One main thread of a lot of the reviews I have read is the regret of not having read the book when one was younger. I thought I agreed with it until I realized, I would not have appreciated or been as moved by this wonderful book when I was a young person. I am glad I waited to read this classic in middle age. All I can say it moved me deeply, made me consider my own views I have held about others and made me desperate to be even a small portion as good a person as Atticus Finch.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|All I can say is that the Farewell Tour Concert of the Eagles is very well done. All of the songs starting from The Long Run to Desperado was fantastic! They made good work changing the songs like Peacefull Easy Feeling and New Kid In Town into something worth listening for.    I recommend you guys to watch this DVD as it will soften even the hardest Stone because of the Songs played by only and the best... The Eagles.    Carlos

When he is faced with certain death he is saved by an 11 year old girl in a mask(Hit Girl). This is a remarkable scene as the sound track plays the music from the Banana Splits. Yes, the sound track helped make the movie.<br /><br />The initial scene with Nicolas Cage was also a great scene. In order to be a big hit, a movie needs a few great scenes and no bad scenes. I believe this film will be a cult classic. I thought the teen acting was all excellent except for the Red Mist. His bad acting was made up for by a sensational performance by Hit Girl (Dakota Fanning move over) who owned every scene she was in.<br /><br />The nudity mentioned on the box must refer to the quick glimpse we get of \\"National Geographic porno\\" we see on the computer while our hero has his pants at his ankles. Frequent f-bomb.
B0010X745K|1.0|Avoid if you have children.   The ending will make you feel horrible.  I wish I could unwatch this genuinely sadistic film.
145283668X|4.0|I had been interested in reading this story for some time.  The cover of this particular edition really drew me in. I had known of the story but not the intimate details you can only get from reading it.  I picked this story up this summer and was immediately drawn in! The story began with a very ominous scene which set the pace.  If you've never read this book, you should pick it up and get acquainted with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
0312370849|5.0|The condition of the book was excellent ... the story was compelling.  It was hard to put down once you got into it.  The ending may have been a bit contrived, but I was happy with it
B003VB5D84|5.0|The two hour theatrical is different footage than what will be used on the DVD release. The two hour movie was the same footage the crowd seen on the big screens. I don't understand how people can review something that isn't even out yet. It will be great, I am sure, but I cant review it until I buy it receive it and watch it.
B0037AGASG|5.0|This album is just great music that reaches all generations not just the tween set. Anyone who loves good music can relate to this sound. Its fun and engaging.
0399156577|1.0|I find inconsistency in Nora Roberts' books.  Sometimes I love them, sometimes I hate them.  Sometimes I just find them easily forgettable. \\"The Search\\" is easily forgettable.  It's not worth the money for the hardcover so if you're a die hard fan, wait for the paperback.    I felt like I was reading a dog training manual (if want to serioiusly train your dog it's not a good enough training manual) with human sex thrown in.  Yes, it has the instant hot attraction, the hard nosed guy who finds the girl irresistable but not beautiful, the girl who's a tough and straightforward target - they're there too but I liked the dogs better than the characters.      I do love dogs and find myself intrigued by the training, but I wasn't looking for a training manual.  The murder part of the story didn't seem that important even at 200 pages.    One good thing I got out of that book is that my dog now brings me the toy and drops it or gives it to me instead of going through a tug of war for it.
B0034JV5YO|5.0|\\"Miss Bob's\\" first review is excellent. For sure I would have missed ever experiencing Richard Galliano had I not gone to his concert as an escape from late-night work on one of my work travels.  The concert was a revelation. Mostly jazz. An unforgettable show.  And now comes Galliano's Bach disc. It will probably not replace your favorite Bach records on the piano or violin but this disc is definitely in the mainstream, it is not a curiosity item. Superb, music-making at the highest level. Also demonstrates the versatility of Bach's music.  So please consider this disc along with Vladimir Ashkenazy's new recording of the six keyboard partitas!
0307454541|4.0|I just finished \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson.  I'm arriving late to the Larsson party; it seems this book published in Sweden under the title, \\"Men Who Hate Women\\", has sold 8 Million since its release in 2005.  It is now an International Best Seller.  The release of its English translation in the US in 2008 has been causing quite a stir but I was unaware of this commotion until the movie caught my eye at Blockbuster.  After watching the movie... twice... it was time to read the book.  I felt compelled to know the back story as I was so intrigued by a movie plotline that could take me from anger to compassion to revulsion to tears.  That was the movie.  And since doing the movie/book switch has its pros and cons...sometimes you like the movie better sometimes you like the book... I am typically uncertain.  The last time I've been this excited to read a book after a movie came in 1991 when the lambs were screaming.  I came home from the movie and read the Thomas Harris thriller in one sitting.  And again this time with a visual of the faces and places in my head I found the book thoroughly entertaining.  The movie by my estimation was true enough to the book...there are some deviations but nothing sufficient to cry foul.  I liked that.<br /><br />So it's not clear if I can give this book 5 stars (as so many have) for its literary prowess and entertainment value since, for me, the movie provided so much help with regard to the character and scene development.  But I will tell you that although I didn't read it in one sitting I was very close. I turned the pages even though I knew the outcome in advance.  Larsson was onto a winning formula and touched just the right balance of history, violence, mystery, technology, sex, and yes...coffee drinking, to etch a new character into my brain...the girl with the dragon tattoo.  So Clarice Starling, please make room for Lisbeth Salander, your Swedish crime solving alter-ego.  I will definitely pick up the next book in this series soon.initely pick up the next book in this series soon.

B00004YM0D|4.0|Songs are right from the movie.  Excellent tunes if you like Mo-Town and 1960s - 70s Rock & Roll.
B003XU02QG|2.0|For me to like a movie it has to have either a character I can relate to or at least someone I can cheer for. This movie had neither. No good guys in this movie. Just lots of blood and body parts.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|The film `My Name Is Khan' is a drama, inspirational love story and contemporary social commentary dealing with the highly emotional subject of racial profiling and the current enmity and distrust between Muslims and America citizenry at large. Definitely not the usual fair for two of Bollywood's greatest stars, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who are better known for dancing and singing their way into the hearts of their millions of fans worldwide. However the magic that occurs in front of the camera whenever these two come together is just as noticeable in `My Name Is Khan' as it is in any of their other many memorable collaborations.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Hindi cinema has long come to the realization that there is a vast cultural difference in the understanding of the nature of time between East and West. While the American filmmaker is known to be rather terse with the amount of time to be spent on plot development, Indian filmmakers relish in the thought of drawing out every subtle nuance available to them. This film is no exception to the rule, running 2 hours and 45 minutes long it will surely be a chore for many and unfortunately there is a rather lengthy period in the middle of the movie that is excruciatingly slow which will cause many viewers to lose focus and interest. However for those with the stamina to stick it out they will be rewarded. In the last hour everything starts to fall into place, the action speeds up and an emotional angst begins to build that will really draw you in. I think when the final credits finally roll by you'll be happy that you invested the time and effort to persevere to the end.
1932100660|5.0|A lot of us grow up with biases, social and intellectual. I read this book with an open mind, as someone who was not particularly health conscious, eating all kinds of foods and exercising whenever I felt like it.     There is a an ancient Chinese proverb: It says \\"To know and not to do is not to know.\\" This is how I approached this book -- I put it to the test. I'm 32 years old, I lost roughly 40 pounds within a year, sleep much better now, my chronic chest pains vanished with three months, I've become more self-aware as a person, all as a result of moving to a plant-based, whole foods diet. O    If you are looking to lose weight only, this book is not for you. But if you are looking to get healthy and live healthy, this book is highly recommended.        PS. I've noticed a reader, M.K. Reiner, has been posting a link, [...] in reply to several reviews to debunk or discredit the book.      The author of this book, T. Colin Campbell, has posted an exhaustive reply.

B00004ZBVG|4.0|This is quite a good movie and I would have given it five stars, if the military hardware had been more authentic. Gene Hackman plays an Airforce Lt Col who is used to the easy life at 20,000 ft and not crawling thru the jungle. Danny Glover plays a Airforce Captain who flys a light aircraft as part of the USAF's Rescue Team. They form a kind of friendship, communicating mostly by radio, as the USAF's Rescue Team try to save the shot down Lt Col. This movie is based on a true story and the main technical advisor is the Lt Col that Gene Hackman, plays in the movie.
0143036556|4.0|This book came in perfect shape! It is full of important and interesting facts about some of the most fascinating cultures of the past and present, like Easter Island, the Norse Vikings, the Mayan civilization, and more. The author shows us what makes societies succeed or fail and is full of lessons for our time too.  There are warnings and hope in this book. It's a bit difficult because it's so full of information. I would recommend it!!
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I can understand the disappointment with the other reviewers in that the movie did not develop the plot like to book did. That being said, I really enjoyed the movie much better than the book. This sort of story lends itself to CG action, and the movie certainly took full advantage of that! I thought the book bogged down in places, especially during all traveling on the quest. And the star-studded cast definitely added to the movie's appeal. My only complaint is a vague feeling that the directing seemed a little rushed and under-developed.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|This is the 4th watch I have purchased.  I use it daily while working and it's great in the pool too.  I have been giving the others to friends as gifts. I guess I'm in a rut because I have purchased the exact same watch each time. Don't mess with a good thing.
0684857219|5.0|The thing that most strikes you and is one of the most impressive features of this book is it's comprehensiveness.  Nothing is left to the imagination.  In an impressive 791 pages of information and photos, practically every permutation of exercise for every major muscle group is covered in this text.  Nutrition, diet and eating is equally discussed in great detail.<br /><br />My overall opinion of \\"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding\\" is that it is indeed made for the aspiring professional bodybuilder or for at least one who wants to just look like one.  Should you read this book from cover-to-cover, you will be lacking very little in the way of how to and information.  A must-have for your bodybuilding library.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Meryl Streep is super. Also worth making a trip to see where this film was made.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Unfortunately, I just finished this book. I'm sorry to say the author, Stieg Larsson past away. This book was good to the last page. I read the other two, but this one was the best. It had everything...mystery, love, friendship. Each character was built throughout the three books. I loved this book!!
0307463745|4.0|Depending on your viewpoint, Rework is either a collection of contrarian essays, or common sense mixed with good business practice. Really, I think its both - you just have to figure out which is which, depending on your own context. The authors often intentionally provoke the reader with a controversial viewpoint, but offer little in terms of actually weighing on both sides short of \\"it worked for us\\". Take it for it is - an opinion - and then it is an enjoyable read.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I fully expected this movie to suck. I was very surprised to find that it was extremely entertaining. It is a very unique film and has a great cast. It balanced the humor and drama like few movies can without destroyng the experience. It has a high re-watch value and could become a cult classic. There was no nudity and while the violence was almost excessive they did it without exploiting it. What I mean by that is they did not dwell on the violence. It was done in quick shots. Not gratutious at all. Loved this movie and look forward to seeing it again.
0938045695|4.0|The kettlebell is of course not new.  It has been around since the turn of the century before modern-day dumbbells became popular.  It's hard to say, but there is something very charming and nostalgic to practice a time of weight-training that has stood the test of time.<br /><br />Does the kettlebell system work?  Yes, of course it does, but as with any proven system of weight training it all comes down to preference and consistency.  It you would like to take a trip to the past or to give your workouts a little variety then using the kettlebell system might be worth experiencing.
B000002IAS|5.0|A live document in any genre should be soulful, exciting, studded with a few flubbed notes that serve as inspiration and stand as a piece of art and entertainment that doesn't feel like a cash-in on a current trend. This satisfies all obligations and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />The premier white-soul act that ever was (D&B) is aided by one of the all time greatest bands. Eric Clapton does himself justice in having his name on the cover for he is at a peak of using his pop intelligence to keep any possible showboating in check. This works perfectly into the context of the music. Dave Mason also proves himself as a damn fine picker. Of course, Delaney and Bonnie are rightfully the headliners. There's choice material hitherto unheard. Delaney performs a touching tribute to Robert Johnson entitled \\"Poor Elijah\\". Bonnie is passionately unadorned on her \\"red light\\" moment. The FM single, \\"Coming Home\\", affords hope and renewal emphasized by Eric's tear-like sounding slide guitar. The first climax is \\"I Don't Want To Discuss It\\" with D&B and the band at their most energetic and combustible best. Then there's the rousing finale of the \\"Little Richard Medley\\" that just rips the joint. Hands down, this is the greatest and wildest live album in all of rock and roll. Play it loud!
B002J8LVO0|5.0|Like a fine wine as it ages this album becomes better over time. It's like I'm hearing it for the first time all over again.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I have children the age Elizabeth Gilbert was when she wrote the book. Perhaps this provides my perspective. A well-written, rather self indulgent (and the author says as well) tome. Nothing more or less.     Anyone else think that Julie Roberts is a decade too old to play this role? What a horrid choice.
B001IF252M|5.0|Tried it out with a post Apr. 10' MacBook Pro 13\\" paired to a Sony 1080p LCD TV. No problem supporting 1920x1080 resolution through VGA.
B001JV5BIA|5.0|The most complete account of the making of \\"The Last House on the left\\" you will ever find plus, the movie itself with all the gore included.  The movie takes you to the brink of madness. There are brief moments of comedy in the movie  that allows you to stop screaming.  The actors and film crew were themselves shocked by the degree of horror they  were creating during the shooting of the movie.  This movie is the real thing. It is far beyond any re-make ever made.  This collector's edition is a must have DVD for the serious collector.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|Wife and I have seen Bon Jovi many times in concert and they always put on an excellent show, this Blu Ray from the Garden is no exception. The crowd that night was in top form and it shows. Overall video quality is very good but the sound mix lacks compared to many new releases on Blu-Ray, comes off a bit on the soft side.
B000NA22C6|3.0|Shades of Hitchcock, The Shining, and various other classics pervade this movie, based on a novella by Stephen King, given life by a somewhat surprisingly cast Johnny Depp.  He is a writer, haunted by events 6 months previous, when he found his wife cheating on him, to a man she subsequently left him for.  Now he lives a life of sloth and occasional unproductive bouts of writing in his cabin in the middle of nowhere... until a mysterious man called Shooter (an excellently ambiguous John Turturro) appears with a grudge to resolve.  Shooter claims Depp stole one of his stories.  Depp's journey to prove he didn't, brings him back into the life of his estranged wife (Mario Bello) and the new man in her life.  Things get gradually weirder, and Depp starts to feel his life unravelling, even as he enlists the help of a bodyguard (Charles Dutton).   There's a nicely evoked sense of manufactured reality to the movie entirely in keeping with the tone of the movie.  This is noticeable for example in the use of mirrors.. through which we travel into to find ourselves in the middle of something we thought we were merely seeing a reflection of, or see something we shouldn't be able to see.  It's satisfyingly disquieting, and it's stylistic moments such as these which make the film a minor pleasure.  That, and the rather excellent cast - Depp, Turturro and Bello all characteristically bring unique life to their roles.  A Hitchockian beginning shifts in tone as the movie progresses, and the ending is telegraphed enough to be not much of a surprise to many I would imagine.. however, it's relatively entertaining getting there.  In any case, we're not asked to spend too long on the journey, the movie being edited down to the bones of the story to keep you engaged.  Good thing too, since there are holes here and the one note trick would get wearying after a while... but the ending works, regardless if you see it coming or not... and as the character says, the ending is the most important thing...  In Bluray, the picture is incredibly crisp and the atmospheric shots of the cabin on the lake terrific, and we can see every whisker of Depp's bizarre almost-beard.  Sounds quality adds to the odd knock and rumble here and there eliciting the occasional creepiness.  All in all, not perfect perhaps, but perfectly fine for an evening's viewing.
B00000E9O7|4.0|lost my original in a house fire..  its great to have it back..one of my all time favs..
B003PX85GK|4.0|This album is beeeeeautiful! Yes, a little different from the last two, but it is fantastic! Somehow they managed to take on a dreamy, more polished quality without at all losing that BoH feel. The mix of instrumentation is pretty much magic. The energy is there, you've just gotta be willing to let it come to you on their terms instead of your own.     Real musicians don't get stuck in some rut of expectation or preconception, they stretch and push and change their sound, without sacrificing the integrity of the band. They have succeeded with this album - it is new and different, yet still sounds 100% like Band of Horses. By the way, the opener is worth the price of admission in itself.    Beautiful job.
0061353248|4.0|I picked up Predictably Irrational after reading The Hyper-Social Organization because the authors referenced this work so many times.    The work about honesty, fairness, and the difference between social transactions and market transactions is fascinating reading.  I guess that we all know that there is a difference between the two, but the experiments written up in this book have provided insights that I'm applying to every situation I get into.  The insights about how people respond to different situations has helped me to understand the people around me and myself better.    For me, a measure of value is how often I reference it.  I finished it last week and I've already talked to co-workers, clients, and family about different aspects of behavior that I gleaned from this book.  next up, \\"the upside of irrationality\\"!
1400106656|4.0|Enough has been written below about the book that I will only offer this - The dark turn at the end of the book caught me off-guard and left me unsatisfied.  To that point, I was enjoying it quite a bit.<br /><br />However, good the author was though, the reader was what made me continue.  Kerry Shale does a great job of providing inflection, comic timing, modulation and other sound effects that turn this into a performance as opposed to simply a recitation.  All hail Mr. Shale and I will go seek out other books you have performed and hope to enjoy them as much as I did this one.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|In ancient Greek literature the stories of the gods were vehicles for profound insights into human nature. Don't expect that here. This movie makes the Greek gods into comic book characters. Missed opportunity. Instead of playing to the lowest level it could have raised us up.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|My benchmark testing sound for bass is \\"I put on\\" by Young Jeezy at 320 kb/s quality. After that I listened to several film scores, Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore, etc. Everything from a 300 piece orchestra to mainstream songs written by computers sound great. I'll be using these on an indie film set for audio monitoring.
B00264GXW2|1.0|How does this novel end up in every category?  I search Fiction, it's there - okay, it's droll, but it's an okay novel, and it fits the genre. So then I search humor, and it's listed twice.  \\"Hmm,\\" I think, \\"it's not that funny, but it has its moments.\\" Freakin Home & Lifestyle?! Now they're just being funny.  I don't have a drawing room, Amazon, so you're not doing me any favors.  Time to sort out the categories.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is about a philosophical, television-watching dog named Enzo, who dreams of the day he becomes a man and gets opposable thumbs.  His owner is a race car driver facing heart-wrenching challenges in his life, and Enzo is there to help him through.  Whether you have a dog or not, this book will make you laugh and more than likely cry.  I think the quote that sums up the story well is \\"There is no dishonor in losing the race.  There is only dishonor is not racing because you are afraid to lose.\\"  Denny lived by this philosophy when it came to the trials in his life.<br /><br />We read this book for our book club party and each person shed a tear or two when discussing the book.  We really identified with the characters, especially Enzo, and it was hard not to get caught up in all the struggles, and joys, in their lives.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
044022425X|5.0|It took me 4 months to read this book -- just because I don't have much time to read. It is a real luxery for me. I had to order the next book in the series before I finished this one.     I keep wanting to know what will happen next with Jamie and Claire...just when I think it's going to get boring it picks up once again. I'm amazed that Diana Gabaldon can write so much about essentially two (now four) characters and keep ones interest! She's a prolific and a brilliant author.    Her books are so large I need to get a kindle so I can take it anywhere :)    I was not disappointed with Drums of Autumn and will keep reading her series.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I can see why Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for her role, she was brilliant.  This movie was a tear jerker.  Shame there weren't more Leigh-Anne Tuohys in this world.  It is an inspiration for us all.
B002VECLVY|3.0|Colin Firth is a wonderful actor, and I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in this film about sadness and the search for, well, not so much meaning as for an escape from oneself.  The main problem was the screenplay.  We see the protagonist, George Falconer, in his relationship with his lover, Jim, as an essentially pessimistic and lugubrious man unable to share in the latter's joie de vivre.  This undercuts his supposed search for meaning because he is clearly predisposed not to find it.  He is not unable to find caring people, but rather he pushes everyone (gently) away because they are apparently not &#34;soul mate&#34; material.  Though he is living in a homophobic era, the early 60s, he is also living in Santa Monica in a beautiful secluded house next to the beach, in an area where it is apparently not really that hard to lead a gay life...although he must be somewhat &#34;invisible.&#34;  With all this, he still can't cope.  He complains of his dull students in the small college where he teaches...but his inertia/langor keeps him from taking a job at Stanford. This is why his toying with the gun in his bed almost comes off as funny rather than tragic...and Firth actually plays it that way.  Since the guy seems so determined to stay unhappy, at some level, one's natural reaction is to think that maybe he should just go ahead and do it.  Of course, we don't want him to.  We would prefer  for him to figure out that life is really what you make of it.  I must also say that I am very sensitive to cinematography.  There is much that is quite good in this film.  In fact, some of it even borders on being great, especially the use of light and color.  This is why it is so disappointing when, perhaps 15% of the time, the neophyte director descends into the cliche of wobbling the camera when things are supposed to become excited or happen suddenly, etc.  How can I watch the wonderful things the camera does one minute and then ignore the meaningless jiggling right afterwards?  I just find it distracting.  It is a sign that the director is trying to follow a formula rather than really thinking things through visually.  When I see this sort of thing, I start thinking more about the cameraman than about what's going on.
0143034901|3.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind starts with a scene that will hook any bibliophile: Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, takes him to the cemetary for forgotten books. In this dusty maze of towering stacks and overflowing shelves, Daniel picks the book that he must protect from obscurity forever, a task that pits Daniel against a madman determined to destroy the book.<br /><br />It's a fantastic premise, and Zafon's beautiful use of language will make you want to stop and re-read passages along the way. But this book is very dark. It draws the reader into a world of ghosts, haunted mansions, asylums, secret pasts, fated lovers, bloodshed, vengence and more. It was too depressing, too disturbing for my tastes. Although the plot was very clever in the way that Daniel's life begins to parallel that of the author he is sworn to protect, the book never lived up to its first few scenes, in my opinion.

There is another i heard that is called Women food and something else.  It makes you evaluate your life and what you have always said you wanted to accomplish versus what you have actually accomplished.  It makes you evaluate the people in your life  and makes you want to eliminate anyone in your life that is not loving, kind and supportive to you.  I want to see the movie to compare how it is in regards to the book.  This is one you will want to read and find hard to put down.

B000UX6THK|5.0|For fans of David Lynch, this series is absolutely essential. If you haven't already seen it, prepare to spend all your free time watching it. I would watch up to five episodes a day (I'm not necessarily proud of it). Twin Peaks mixes David Lynch's surreal vision with a dynamic cast of characters. I quickly became addicted to this show and deeply invested in the characters. Now that I've finished the series I've been experiencing withdrawals, but now that I own the series, I can relive the whole thing.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This cpu cooler is absolutely THE BEST cooler you can get for your dollar.  I can overclock my i5-750 to 4.0 ghz and be within thermal specifications(max load intel burn test is 76c).  The noise is up there when the fan is running on max(could also be due to my HAF 932 having a lot of places to let noise out of...), but that is nothing a cheap fan controller can't fix for when your not pushing the processor.  Even though it is a bit loud, I can't hear it at all during gaming.  Also, I have yet to grab a second fan for push-pull config and would expect it to add 2-4c cooling with that setup.      Again, I recommend this product to anyone on a budget or to anyone not wanting to spend more than 50 bucks on a cooler.

B0036TGSRG|2.0|This is a comment about the Blu-ray edition not about the movie.<br /><br />When I purchase this blu-ray I don't read the cover that says \\"BLU-RAY+DVD -BOTH VERSIONS ON ONE DISC-\\". This is annoying, I personally hate this practice of using both sides of a disc to put different versions of a movie (Wide-Full on past DVD's). In this particular case, to put the blu-ray edition on one side, and the DVD version on the other.<br /><br />I prefer to get only the blu-ray version (in what I'm interested) instead of getting both on one disc.<br /><br />How much can cost a separate disc?<br /><br />Please Summit Entertainment, don't continue with this practice.

1401310400|1.0|If Richard Castle wrote this poorly he probably wouldn't be living in that fancy apartment. This novel is not believable as a tie-in and isn't well-crafted by any standard. It's like reading the TV script for a really bad episode of Castle. I don't think savvy readers will enjoy this much. I know I didn't.
B0026M1Y3M|2.0|Am I the only one who hears the distortion and hiss on this recording? Mainly in the guitar tracks. Not every song, but Heavy Metal Thunder, Strong Arm and a few others. Just a horrible sound? I never owned the vinyl of this album, but it couldn't have been recorded that way, could it? I have other Saxon remasters from this series...Wheels of Steel, Power and the Glory and Denim and Leather...they are great remasters and I don't hear this noise. I've had two copies of the Strong Arm cd and even downloaded a track to compare and the distorted hiss is in everything. Please tell me somebody can hear this besides me.   2 stars is for the sound, not the songs. They're great! But I would sure love to hear them without the noise.
B001RNI34E|2.0|I have to agree with so many of the reviewers.  This book had such promise and the subject matter was gripping.  I just lost my patience with all of the characters and with the author's inability to stay on track.  The behavior of the characters was so outlandish it was impossible to take the story seriously.  I had high hopes for the book and I was actually reluctant to read it as I normally will not read books that center on child abduction or other crimes against children.  This was initially heartbreaking as the mother's (Alice) suffering was so palatable and then it was just downright absurd.
1423113381|5.0|I started reading this book because it was written by Rick Riordan and because it has some Egyptian mythology incorporated into it. Definitely much better written than the Percy Jackson series. I loved it!! Can't wait for the next book!
B000F3T3CS|5.0|The Acting of Villazon and Netrebko are amazing and these two matched perfectly. I guess it is true as someone said 'when you are on stage, audiences want much more than you just sing'.<br /><br />The orchestra wasn't at their best compare to their other productions I heard. But, still a great performance.<br /><br />Audience are so in love with Mr. Villazon. They asked a encore during the opera, which, is really rare. I am sure he deserves it.<br /><br />Ms. Netrebko was at her youth and pretty. Beautiful performance.<br /><br />A must have if you want a this opera in your collection.
B002R5V7MG|2.0|Gustavo Dudamel - or, as I prefer to call him after watching this concert, Mr Exaggeration - has been hailed as yet another wunderkind of classical music conductors, together with such diverse figures as Daniel Harding and Christian Thielemann. Some people assume that classical music needs such wunderkinds - for instance, young charming guys that like to show off - in order to survive in the contemporary globalized world of kitsch and bad taste. This DVD inaugural LA Philharmonic concert is surely a welcome release for those sceptics.<br /><br />But when I watched it, I was rather horrified by Mr Exaggeration's behavior at the conductor's rostrum: he looked like some kind of a madman from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (cf. [[ASIN:B00006JMQG The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Restored Authorized Edition)]]) or a scarecrow automaton: insane gestures and grotesque facial expressions. For reference (and antidote), check, e.g., Evgeni Mravinsky's sober conducting style on Youtube.<br /><br />What about the music, then? Well, I suppose that John Adam's \\"City Noir\\" is the perfect work for Mr Exaggeration, since it is a very violent work of repeated exaggerations. But I am no fan of Adams or minimalism in general. So I have no real opinion here.<br /><br />Mahler's first, however, is another case. Mr Exaggeration has already recorded the fifth ([[ASIN:B000UNMUFK Mahler: Symphony No. 5]]), an acceptable but not impressive interpretation. Things are worse here, however. Exaggerations rule - is it really an interpretation (that is, what we usually mean with \\"interpretation\\") and not just an attempt to show off? Check for instance the second movement, which is virtually torn to pieces by all these extreme exaggerations. Other releases from Mr Exaggeration and DG show that the young conductor also has a developed taste for \\"light music\\" (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B0013USZHG Fiesta]]) or easy showpieces. Perhaps this indicates what kind of conductor Mr Exaggeration actually is. I would not be surprised if he is going to conduct the Vienna New Year concerts in the future.<br /><br />The LA audience is very pleased, however, apparently spellbound by all the wunderkind exaggerations (it is surely hard to resist that temptation, it's probably like being charmed by children's playing). But I wonder if classical music actually can survive if \\"overkill\\" is what \\"interpretation\\" should mean today.<br /><br />Fortunately, we are not short of outstanding Mahler firsts. Walter ([[ASIN:B000002A7H Mahler: Symphonies No. 1 & No. 2; Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen]]), Kubelik ([[ASIN:B00004TQUC Mahler: Symphony No. 1]]), Ancerl ([[ASIN:B00006IZPQ Ancerl Gold Edition 6: Mahler Symphony no. 1/ Strauss - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]), Horenstein ([[ASIN:B000001PBD Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 1]])...  any of these will highlight the severe shortcomings of Dudamel's mutilated \\"interpretation\\".<br /><br />I will try to forget that I ever watched this awful concert.g to conduct the Vienna New Year concerts in the future.

0307474712|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel about two people who deny their true feelings for one another because of the differences between them.  Watching these characters unfold - on the same day - over the course of 20 years is brilliant.  I found myself thinking about Emma and Dexter - and the sincere love they shared - for days and days after I finished the book.  This is a truly heartwarming, true-to-life scenario of two people - leading different lives - who complete each other in every sense.  Love is blind in many ways - and this book walks you through the tragic blindness of two people who madly need and love each other but reciprocally admit and appreciate it far too late......     A MUST read....for anyone who has truly been in love - timing right or wrong.  This is a beautifully written book that will make you laugh heartily and will heavily pull at your heart strings - Kudos, Mr. Nicholls!!!
B000RZIGSG|1.0|I wasted my money upgrading from the single disc, first edition dvd of Flashdance to get this 2-disc \\"Special\\" edition thinking it would be full of extra content, but instead was full of something else. With Flashdance being the phenomena that it was, I totally expected Paramount to go all out and make this the ultimate Flashdance experience (similar to the VIP treatment that weaker films like Showgirls even seems to receive), but no dice. There must be tons of Flashdance info to really pack two discs. The hour long VH-1 Behind the Move - Flashdance episode would've been perfect to include on this dvd set, as it provided a thorough look at the making, the music and impact of this blockbuster smash. And since Paramount owns MTV/VH-1, it would've been a no brainer. And to make matters worse is the funky six-song sampler they tossed in to make up disc two. They couldn't even give you the whole soundtrack. This is exactly why dvds aren't selling like they used to.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Way better than Rob Zombies versions, they keep making remakes to all these classic horror films when they need to contiue the franshises, not only that, they're making the remakes look ridiculous Michael and Jason are silent killers they dont whine grunt or any of that and they made there characters a whole lot weaker Kane Hodder played the best Jason and whoever played Michael in pt. 1,2,4,5,6, and 7 played Michael very good, the resurrection was'nt all that how Michael gonna get his butt whooped by busta rhymes? and Jason does'nt run so yea aint nothing like the originals.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, this works! I'm going to date myself, but I started with the Jane Fonda tapes and have tried almost all the popular home exercise videos. This one is the absolute best. Noticeable results with just 20-30 minutes a day! It is difficult, but I find myself saying, \\"I can do anything for 20 minutes!\\" I'm in level 3 - just 3 to go before I've completed each level. I have a pair of jean shorts that I am able to just pull down without unbuttoning or unzipping. That's results!
B002OT730K|1.0|Jagger once said about David Bowie's first live album in '74: \\"He was awful. If I got the kind of reviews that he got for that album, I would honestly never record again. Never.\\" Jagger soooo funny... I bought this Stones live album when it first came out in '77 and I really hated it, even after several listenings... Where \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" triumphs from beginning to end, this bloated, self-indulgent set of live recordings BOMB! Jagger sounds drunk through much of it, mumbling through the songs as though he's bored, and just wants to get through them as quickly as possible. I later learned that this release wasn't even a true \\"live\\" album, as it was heavily overdubbed in the studio with layers of guitar work (according to \\"Life\\" by Keith Richards). Even Warhol wanted nothing to do with it after Jagger \\"corrected\\" his cover art painting with pencil... I suppose there's historical significance with this one: last album to be issued on the Stones record label before going with EMI, last one with \\"Richard\\" before Keith added the 's'... but aside from a very few high points, the whole of the album was a disappointment for me. LYL is their 3rd officially released recording of some of their live performances, but if you want to hear them at the peak of their career as a true rock and roll band, you've got to get \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" instead. It's definitely the water mark for all live albums.
0790729393|5.0|I have watched this movie a few times and really enjoy the themes of friendship. loyalty, revenge, retribution, justice and moral dilemmas. I also read the book and the movie pretty much follows the book almost verbatim...so watching the movie is good enough although some of the detail is missing from the horrendous abuse suffered by some of the main characters. The acting by all is great and well worth the time and effort to see.<br />Reading some of the reviews though is quite disturbing. IT'S A MOVIE BASED ON A NOVEL BASED ON SOME EXPERIENCES IN THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR! When words like homophobic get thrown around about some aspects of this movie when there is no reference or even the slightest hint to anything to do with homosexuality it makes one wonder as to the sensitivity level of some viewers. I'm not a  psychiatrist but in my humble opinion if this movie makes someone who sees it think that one of the messages being conveyed is that it's ok to murder a serial child rapist because the bad guy must have some homosexual tendencies that obviously soar above the depraved evil of the acts committed then that viewer may be a little too sensitive to offer an objective review. This is not intended to offend anyone just to help some realize that an objective review of this movie should be just that without inserting perceived slights and imagined motives.<br />Reform schools like prisons are not nice places and terrible things happen there for all sorts of reasons. The justice system is not perfect and is manipulated almost on a daily basis. Just look at the O J Simpson and Robert Blake murder trials for some of the most famous cases. So all is within the realm of possibilities.<br />In any case if you're going to watch this movie with an open mind and your sensitivity meter turned down a bit I think you will enjoy a well written and well acted movie, especially if you're from the Hell's Kitchen area of NYC.
B002NOAF9W|1.0|I see the price for this disaster has already fallen by $20, and it's no surprise. GYYYO is my favorite Stones album after Beggars Banquet, so I was very anxious to get this as soon as it delivered. Only problem is, it didn't deliver. I already have the LP and CD versions of GYYYO, and this box includes just another copy of the CD I already have. There's another CD with no Stones on it; just boring filler that I couldn't even finish listening to. The \\"movie\\" is such a bummer, that as soon as I watched most of it, I put everything back in the box and sold it on Ebay. If you already have the remastered CD and a copy of the film, \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" (which includes the clip of \\"Prodigal Son\\") then you've already got the essential contents of this new release. I don't know who from the Stones organization authorized this mess - if they even did - but what SHOULD have been a real treat, ended up being a real POS. Save your bread, cats.
B000000OF6|5.0|These are not just two greatest hit's to make money they are both proper greatest hit's and both are a must, especally as they both have there own unique sounds and here is my individual review for each album.<br /><br />Greatest Hits 1<br /><br />The Greatest Greatest Hits of all time. All the songs are brilliant / legionary. It's a must have album in any collection you won't be disappointed in any song and is still enjoyable now a days. The music last for ever and all the songs are brilliant.It's all well written, produced and performed. Rock at it's best<br /><br />Greatest Hits 2<br /><br />Just as good as Greatest Hits I but different. I prefer Greatest Hits I but it's still brilliant and probably one of the only groups who could do two Greatest Hits of this high standard. Even if you don't know the names of the songs, you will know them when you listen to it and if you still don't reconise them you will be humming, singing, jumping around or tapping your feet along, because they are all brilliant songs. I must have in any collection
B002VWNICW|5.0|Great love story. Excelent actors. Great Blu Ray image and sound. And an extra scene that blew me off!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've owned a few of these sweepers & can not live without them. They work very well & are a great alternative to vacuuming. They are not meant to replace vacuuming but if you live in a house with kids that get cereal all over the floor, or you need to sweep a high traffic area there is nothing better than these sweepers, period.    THE GOOD:   They charge quickly and are always ready to use. The unit is so lightweight it glides fast over large areas & I believe picks up & cleans a big area faster than a vacuum could do considering the heavier weight & slow moving with the vacuum.  you can expect the sweeper to pick up 95% of dirt & small particles. Anything small gets swept into the chamber but if the object is larger (like a marble or pen cap) it may not fit or may clog the brush area. This is easy remedied by removing the clogged item by hand, or just avoid any object bigger than a marble. Super small stuff like dust & fine dirt may not get picked because this is a  sweeper, not a vacuum. But you're still going to vacuum once in awhile, right?   The sweeper works on all flat floors & low pile carpet (but it does the best job on hardwood & tile floors or a non-carpeted surface)  This product will pick up all the VISIBLE stuff on the floor so its great fora fast clean up or when you have company coming over & you don't have time to vacuum. These work ten times better than a broom regarding speed & easy of use. They also don't create dust clouds while sweeping so if you're an allergy sufferer this is better than using a traditional broom.  When new, these units also hold a very long charge & can sweep endlessly, I can't imagine not being able to finish a sweeping job when the unit is fully charged. As the unit ages though expect the charge to dissipate as all rechargeable batteries eventually wear out. I saw another review that said the manual warns against over-charging which can kill the battery over time, so perhaps take the battery off the charger after 24 hoursso it doesn't get over-charged.    THE BAD:  these units are a bit flimsy so you can't expect them to last like $200 vacuum. If you aren't careful the pole will bend or crack, & little plastic pieces can break in the sweeper. I had part of the top tray come loose on my last sweeper but it was easily fixed with a piece of clear tape (or duct tape). All the negative reviews about these breaking make me wonder, do people realize this is a $20 item? I've about to purchase my third unit, but I don't mind because we've gotten about 2 years out of each one. Again for $20 even if I had to replace one every 6 months I'd still do it because there is nothing on the market at this price that does as good as a job. We literally use this every day on our floors & could not live without it.   The unit does have a tendency to collect hair around the brush. I've found this does not affect the sweeper operation unless you really let it get bad & never clean it. Otherwise the brush is cleanable by hand & pulling out the hair & debris or by using a scissor or brush-cleaning tool to remove caught material.  Over time the tiny feet that make this unit glide over your floor will wear down & become thinner. When this happens the sweeper will not work as well because the brush will be too close to the floor & make the motor run slower. However it takes a long time to wear out the feet, probably a year or two with daily use so this is not a big deal. But note that if you wore the feet out you probably got more than your money's worth.  The dust tray release is a little flimsy but operational.  you sometimes have to sweep over an area a few times to get all the items you are trying to sweep up, remember this is not a vacuum so there is no suction. Considering that it works surprisingly well & get most everything with the first pass.    SUMMARY:  Great unit, no serious complaints. I think this product is better than the average reviews it is getting, simply because I don't think you can ding aproduct because it doesn't last forever. Performance-wise its exceptional at sweeping, 5 stars. This will do much better than a small cheap hand-vacuum or stick vacuum because I've tried many of them. Of course its not going to do as well as a full upright vacuum. For its design & price it is exceptional. When this unit first came out it was $39 on sale. Now its half that price new. If you buy this unit be realistic, its not a $200 vacuum. You may have to replace it in 6 months or a year but at $20 for something you use daily, I think this is still a good investment (I get about two years out of mine before they die). There are very few items you can buy for $20 that are going to last forever. This is the best alternative to daily vacuuming especially for hardwood & tile floors and nothing is faster for a quick clean up. Can't see how you would not like this product.

0307474712|4.0|Dexter and Emma. Em and Dex. One day, each year for twenty years, is detailed in the lives of a young British couple. Who knows what the future will bring? Infatuation, sex, love, loss, heartache, poverty, wealth, marriage, divorce, fame, notoriety, anything is possible. While reading this book, you become so close to the characters that you want to reach out and point them in the right direction. Speak up and say no, that's not a good choice. You're not going the best way. Yes, you're on the right path. Keep it up. Some of the characters, like Emma, are lovable. The kind of people you would want to have as friends. Others, like Dexter are less respectable. It is hard to tell at first, what anyone sees in them. This is where the book shines. Like life, it gradually gives us incites into characters and in so doing, makes us feel something about them. It may be good or bad. Whether we gradually change our mind about someone or find our first impression was correct. In the end, we care about these people. At times I caught myself thinking, why am I reading this book? It's just about the lives of some basically ordinary people. Then I would pick it back up to see down what paths the future would lead these seemingly ordinary people.

B000005J56|5.0|I don't know if anyone else shares my feeling about this, but the only thing we can thank Ry Cooder for is bringing this amazing slice of history of what I consider our Southern Appendix to the light of a demonstrably appreciative audience of which I count myself an ecstatic member. I give this 5 stars because it is an amazing journal full of amazing music made by amazing musicians. And Ry Cooder is one of them--just not this time or place. A careful viewing of this wonderful film catches Real Cubans making Real Cuban music not a little startled at the injection of Cooder's otherwise stellar slide playing into their performance. It was wholly uncalled for, and their reaction is not one of appreciation but rather the one we have when we are at a Ramones Concert, and Barry Manilow takes the stage. Just so anyone gets the wrong idea: I am a huge fan of Ry Cooder as long as he is playing Borderline where he belongs, and we all owe him a huge debt first by recognizing the treasure we have been missing, and by bringing this film about at all. And for that we can forgive him much, but it's too little, too late. There it is for all to see forever into eternity. It was simply awful. And disruptive, and entirely inappropriate. There is NO PLACE in Cuban music for slide guitar. None. Cuban music is precise, totally rhythmic, and although created on analog instruments, almost digital in its execution. American Swamp Slide does not resonate with this music. It sticks out like a sore thumb, and Every Time Cooder injects his mojo into the mix, the thing sort of popcorn farts and would die if it were not for the otherworldly professionalism of these amateur and largely ignored Cuban virtuosos. They are taken aback, they look at Ry with a WTF that we can barely detect because they have so much class, and then they carry on in spite of this arrogant puppy like incursion into their sacred domain. Sorry, Ry, I love you, but you should have sat this one out and not tried to be part of the Club. It would have served us all a whole lot better if you had apprehended your true part in this play to have produced THEM and brought THEM to us unvarnished and untainted by anything other than themselves. Yes, they still get 5 stars because of who they are and their simply incredible story, but it was not your story nor your part, and we should have never seen your face or heard that glorious slide at all. Ever. My only wish is that you could do it all over again and heed this advice. But I am not holding my breath for reunion. Ego comes and goes, but cinema is forever. 2 bad. Hugs and kisses.

031606792X|5.0|I recently discovered the Twilight Saga series and just finished Book 4, Breaking Dawn last night. The book was great for the most part.    The book is broken into 3 parts.  Part one is in Bella's point of view. It begins with the wedding of Bella and Edward. It was nice of course because it was at the Cullen house but it seemed rushed and could have been more descriptive.  The honeymoon on Esme Island was very romantic and well written. This was when Bella and Edward made love for the first time. Even though Bella got bruised, it was a funny yet romantic part of the book. Then Bella gets pregnant and they have to get home right away.    Part 2 is in Jacob's point of view.  It became boring to me at this point especially with crabby Leah around. The wolf pack wanted to kill Bella because of the baby but of course Jacob revolted against it and assured Bella's safety. It got better as Bella became ill from her unborn baby. The description is so vivid that you can see and imagine everything Bella is going through. The bond between Bella and her unborn child is so strong. Bella has to drink blood to stay alive and feed her baby but then the blood makes the baby stronger and it starts hurting Bella. Finally, Edward has to save Bella by injecting his venom into her heart because the birth of their baby was killing her. Bella is turned into a vampire and then Jacob imprints on baby Reneesmee.       Part 3 is back to Bella's point of view.  One of the best parts of the book to me was when all the vampire covens arrived and when Bella was perfecting her gift, her protective shield.  The descriptions of the other vampires were so clear that you could visualize them perfectly. It was great when Irina was killed because she wasted the Volturi's time by claiming the Cullen's had an immortal child. Then Alice and Jasper came back with another half breed child that was 150 years old so the Volturi leave because no crime had been committed. It ended perfectly just the way it shouldwith Bella and Edward spending eternity together. Cannot wait to see the first part of the movie next year!
1596680199|5.0|I have a lot of \\"how-to\\" polymer clay bead-making books in my library, and I think \\"Making Polymer Clay Beads\\" by Carol Blackburn is the best one ever! Not a lot of useless gab but lots and lots of great photos and step-by-step tutorials on exactly how to create some awesome looking beads. She also has some very valuable tips and a great list of essential materials. This book would be perfect for a beginner as well as a pro.
B000VOON94|5.0|How does one even review this timeless work of art?  Amazing music.  The quality of the recording is the best I've heard.  Now I'll qualify that statement by admitting that I have not heard a good vinyl copy of the title.  I find the SACD reproduction substantially better than the CD.  Cymbals have that non-tizzy quality.  I guess I'll risk crucifixion by saying it sounded very analog to me.  Five stars all the way around.  Worth the price.
B003O85W3A|3.0|3 1/2      Continuing what has become an acceptable if not trailblazing standard of current indie rock credibility, AF's latest further refines melodic bombast for rootsy subtleties, etching out consistent protest-pop-prowess with sonic integrity selflessly layered throughout its relatively sprawling spread.

1601251505|5.0|I've been playing D&D for like 20 years now, including the basic set, the red box, AD&D 1, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4. When 4th Edition came out, I bought all the new books and a subscription to D&D Insider, retiring my old 3.5 collection. I ran several 4th Edition games and enjoyed them especially the character generator. Man, that is like the mightiest piece of gaming software ever written (hint, hint Paizo). That being said, 4th Edition felt different. More than anything, it really reminded me of World of Warcraft from the character powers to the entire business model of releasing new books like \\"expansions\\".<br /><br />I decided to ask around and see what some of my favorite RPG designers such as Monte Cook and Sean K Reynolds (Bruce Cordell being the other) were up to. I knew that Monte and Sean didn't work for WotC anymore, and saw that they'd been working for Paizo on this thing called Pathfinder, which at the time I'd never heard of. So, I started poking around here on Amazon and saw a heap of 5-star reviews. I bought the core rulebook as a PDF for 10 bucks to check it out.<br /><br />First off, I almost wet myself with joy because Wayne Reynolds (WAR) does almost all the art for Pathfinder and he's my favorite. The PDF quality is premium. It's thoroughly bookmarked and cross-linked for ease of use. They keep the PDF updated with the errata. I REALLY liked what I was reading. They'd taken 3.5 and smoothed out the rough spots (like grappling, etc), ending up with what a 100 other reviewers have called D&D 3.75. That is a very accurate description.<br /><br />The changes they've made are intelligent and fun. There's many other reviews here on Amazon that detail the changes so I won't get into them other than to say thumbs up. BTW, there's a free conversion document on how to covert D&D 3.5 to Pathfinder. It's really easy. Easy enough for me to do on the fly mid-game. I've been using all my \\"Ptolus, City by the Spire\\" stuff with Pathfinder smoothly. Yay, my mountain of 3.5 stuff is no longer obsolete.<br /><br />In summary: Sweet product PDFs to try out before you spend more $ on a hardcover book.

B003O85W3A|5.0|Being sincere, i've met Arcade Fire by their duet live with Bowie, my favourite artist. As i think Bowie has really got old, i didn't see that performance with interest, so Arcade Fire hasn't took my attentino then. Some time later, i've saw on TV a live performance of Wake Up by them alone and i thought \\"Wow, this is amazing!\\", but haven't paid attention further than that anyway.   And then, came a day, that i was on youtube looking for clips of Potemkin, and then i found the Intervention video.   Since that day i've become a huge fan of Arcade Fire.   Both Funeral and Neon Bible struck me really hard, no other modern albums struck me as they did.    So i was eager to hear this new album.    Is it great? Yes. Is it better than their previous albums? No.    No, i have to admit, it isn't superior to NB and Funeral, in fact, probably isn't at the same level. But Arcade Fire reached in those albums very high standards of creativity, higher than most of the modern bands albums. So, if you create something that great, clearly, it's higly possible that your next effort will be below them.    This happened here, but don't get it wrong, it's a great album anyway, far better than most of the albums released this year (i will not dare to say the better), so i't a really pleasing hearing.    Not only is good because it has good song and it's well played, but because Arcade Fire has shown again that they are versatile, it's not an effort to do the something in the vein of their previous albums, it's an effort to do something different and new, and by far, something good. That's what i expect of them, and they filled that expectation.    Third Albums are usually a problem for most of the bands, Arcade Fire hadn't that problem, they will pass this test with easyness.    Buy it. You won't regret it.
030745455X|5.0|Right after I finished the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I immediately ordered the second in the series.  Like with the first book, it took a little bit to get the momentum going.  I agree with some reviewers that there were some lulls in the middle of the book but I did not seem to mind too much.<br />The book was in one word - \\"awesome.\\"  I could not put the book down, and when I did, I obsessed about when I could fit in some time to read more.<br />I was, however, a bit disappointed in the ending.  The book ended a bit suddenly and I thought it was still in the midst of the story.  The first book was complete and wrapped all loose ends.  The third book will essentially be a continuation of the second book.  I wished they really just made one big book so I wouldn't have to wait for my next order to come in!!<br />Overall, highly highly recommended!
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Roman Polanski's The Ghost Writer is a great thriller in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest; This is a god send due the garbage being made today.      Ewan McGregor stars as a writer who replaces a recently deceased \\"ghost writer\\" who was working on the memoirs of a contriversal former British Prime Minister named Adam Lang, played in good spirit by Pierce Brosnan. Mc Gregor's character was brilliantly written because you feel his place in the world as an anonymous person, you actually never learn his name during the entire film. McGregor gets caught up in Lang's quest to not only preserve his legacy for prosperity but also fight political scandal; The film shows the power of words in the game of politics and in an ego-maniac's case, it never ends.    I also adore the settings of the film, everything is purposely cold and disdant and McGregor is essentially swimming in shark infested waters and never knows where the danger comes from. One of Polanski's great trade marks is always to have the main protagonist caught in sort of an existential box in which the character can't seem to escape.     The film builds to a gripping climax when Mcgregor investigates Lang's possible connections to the CIA and is hunted down by people who don't want him to find out; At one point a brilliantly staged low-speed chase occurs. Again, this is a welcome change from the standard thrillers of conspiracy without substance, characterization, and usually has everything occuring in public view as opposed to into the shadows.      Roman Polanski returns in top form here as a director and co-writer; Surely one of his masterworks.
B003K025TQ|5.0|To me, Lee Ritenour is non-pareil among contemporary, jazz-based, genre-adventurous virtuosos.  His 1991 masterpiece \\"Stolen Moments\\" remains a personal favorite and stellar example of the Gibson L-5's rightful preeminent place as a jazz axe within a contemporary setting.  6 String Theory is another sample out of a Rit discography rife with aural delights, this time bearing the unmistakable stamp of co-producer and Hero (with a capital \\"H\\") Steve Lukather along with a cast of heavys including Rit and Luke themselves, George Benson, Pat Martino, Joe Bonamassa, Keb-Mo, B.B. King, and the list goes on.  Played over a resolving system, this genre-blending disc will transport you to guitar heaven.  Played in the car, and you don't want it to end.  A delight in every respect.  Rit's best?  Maybe.  My ears remain clasped to his L-5 days, but admittedly, this one's been in heavy rotation as late-night spinner.  If you're into the instrument, and Rit and Luke remain your heroes, or even if they don't, this is a must-have.  Love it.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|When I first started watching this it seemed a little weird, but I didn't know who Jack White was and it seemed to start out slow.  The next thing I know I'm completely absorbed and feel like I'm sitting in the room with them.  I now have it in my collection as one of those movies that give me that wonderful feeling I get when I go to a live concert and just feel so happy to be there.  Check it out on one of the premium channels if you're not sure, then HAVE it in your collection.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Ok, let's be honest. The original \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" was made by the same guy who made the Sinbad movies. He casted nobody actors to star in a movie that was intentionally cheesy, paid no attention to mythology whatsoever (though, in fairness to that, neither did this movie), and used techniques that were outdated when released. Not that they weren't amusing, but they hold nothing to the 2010 version.    So here comes a remake, one with excellent special effects, starring actors like Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson, that is far darker, and was not made to be laughable. Scene after scene, the battles carry parts of the story of Persues, a demi-god (half god half man), the son of Zeus. Basically people are tired of the gods, the gods get mad, Zues let's several do what they want, including titans and releasing other monsters (Release the Kraken!). Here we have a very real looking snake-Medusa, Pegasus (flying horse), the kraken of course, and a showdown with Hades himself. And for the guys there are two very hot women involved as well.    All in all, it was a very good sort of pre-summer blockbuster movie (that, as of August 15th, way better than any of the summer movies released), and has made enough money to warrant Clash Of The Titans II in 2012. So don't pay attention to the die-hard fans of the original, they are holding onto a movie so much that they do no allow themselves to enjoy it's far superior remake. They are also the ones giving the bad reviews given every single one talks about the original more than this movie.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Lofty expectations are rarely met.  The Expendables is one of those unusual occasions in which expectations are not only met, but they are exceeded.  This is pantheon level action, a truly guy's guy movie, a knock-down drag-out, butt kicking, action extravaganza that pays homage to the awesome battles and ridiculous body counts of 80s action flicks.  There has been a dearth of traditional action films and heroes over the past two decades, but the old guys get together with some new blood to retake the title.<br /><br />Speaking of the awesome battles, they are split into four definite specialties: guns, fighting, knives, explosions.  Last first, the explosions are incredible.  Absolutely everything blows up; it's as if gas lines ran throughout every set piece on the film.  Half way through the movie I began to visualize mighty pillars of the villain's estate as massive sticks of dynamite.  The knife throwing is thankfully more than a novelty, as roughly 20 enemies on the Caribbean island of Vilena get gutted, beheaded, and/or eviscerated.  With this cast, battles are guaranteed.  Well, it's MUCH more than expected, much more realistic than anticipated, so real that Stallone had to have emergency surgery on his back after Austin throws him into a brick wall (you'll know the scene when you see it).  Last but not least, the gun-play.  Put simply, this is a Waco stock-piling, NRA wet dream.  Thousands of bullets carve bodies apart like Commando on steroids.  No less than five times did I lean forward, wide-eyed saying \\"F*** yeah!\\"  Turn the action up to eleven, folks.  If you don't like this movie, check your pulse.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is everything you'd expect.  Stallone leads a group of mercenaries consisting of Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Dolph Lundgren, and Jason Statham who are hired by an undercover CIA agent (Bruce Willis) to ostensibly remove a dictator/general and his rogue CIA agent funding.  Throw a beautiful woman who needs saving into the mix and you have enough plot, and enough reason, to fly a jet into a small port town and spray down twenty or so soldiers before lighting another couple dozen on fire with jet fuel...for starters.<br /><br />Go into this tabula rasa, looking for minimal plot and sub-par dialogue.  Who cares?  Negotiate with hollow point is what I say.  Compromise with C4.  Adrenaline from beginning to end.  Expect John Matrix to kill without discretion, Rocky to battle Ivan Drago, Jet Li to kick everyone within roundhouse radius, Randy Couture and Stone Cold Steve Austin to dish out body slams like herpes, Jason Statham to trump his own Transporter movies, Terry Crews to blow everything up (p-p-p-p-p-p-power!), and just appreciate that Arnold and Willis are on board for the cameo, the camaraderie, and the yippee-ki-yay...(you know the rest)!!  It's that good.<br /><br />Honestly, this is the best action movie I've seen in twenty years.  I could write a 50-page thesis on various subtleties I enjoyed.  The only negatives are the absence of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme (both were offered parts), and some of the action was too choppy (think thirty straight one-second bursts).  Both easily overlooked.  However, unless you go in expecting Citizen Kane (if you do, it's your fault), this epic crowd pleaser should leave you cheering.ve enough plot, and enough reason, to fly a jet into a small port town and spray down twenty or so soldiers before lighting another couple dozen on fire with jet fuel...for starters.

B000YABYLA|1.0|Good Music, good actors, even some good snotty remarks.<br /><br />1 star to counter all the people who weren't really paying attention<br /><br />Juno stomps thru this movie like some alterna-Disney princess. She does whatever she wants, says whatever she wants and no one really stands in her way(her step-mother offers the only resistance, however limply). Juno's a rotten little twit.<br /><br />What I really didn't like was the ominous feeling that the film was going to try to turn around and give her a sympathetic makeover. Sure enough. After spending most of the film being rude to everyone and getting her way she can't handle it when one of the other characters finally peels himself off the background and does something she doesn't like. Now she's fragile and emotional...doesn't stop her from continuing being rude though.<br /><br />The only sweet moments are when Juno's mouth is shut and the soundtrack comes to the front. It felt really manipulative having such upbeat music in a movie about such a jerk.<br /><br />The mailbox full 'o Tic Tacs was pure insulting treacle. She treats Michael Cera's character like a cure for boredom(essentially how she got pregnant), then as an insignificant nuisance up until she the wants him back. That's where the Tic Tacs come in. Aww, she really does love him and he goes for it. Tic Tacs? If any candy fits him it's a Sucker!<br /><br />The biggest insult came at the end in the hospital after she's given birth. The dad says to her 'Someday you'll be back here again, but on your terms.' Sorry, who's terms were the previous 90 or so minutes devoted to? It might have been the right 'tender moment dialog' but it totally ignores the facts.
B002ZG999U|4.0|The Expendables is  a movie starring some of the greatest action stars of all time from Sylvester Stallone to Jason Statham, Dolph Lungren, Jet Li to Stone Cold Steve Austin.     The movie was another solid entry by Director Sylvester Stallone. Essentially Stallone wanted to make an old school action movie giving an ode to its stars and 80s action flicks.    With that said, the plot is very thin. Stallone and his Expendables are going to overthrow a South American Dictator named General Garza played by David Zayas. The General has aligned himself with a couple of dirty Americans that are former Cia. Eric Roberts and Stone Cold Steve Austin are the general's amigos in his venture of bullying the people of his country.  Stallone plays Barney Ross while Jason Stathan plays Lee Christmas his best friend. Jet Li, Dolph Lungren, and Randy \\"The Natural\\" Couture round out the Expendables team. Dolph plays a would be traitor who may or not be playing both sides.    As mentioned Stallone wanted to make an action flick giving an ode to its start, so the plot really doesn't matter here. Throughout the movie, you'll hear some of the actors talk about their previous roles and what they think of one another. It's done in such a fashion that it's very funny. For instance, Jet Li has a funny scene talking with Stallone about how he deserves to get paid more money to overthrow the Dictator because he always works harder than the bigger taller guys in the business. Or another funny scene is the conversation with Stallone, Arnold Schwarzennger, and Bruce Willis and Willis's character asks Stallone why Arnold is such a jerk and Stallone's character replies \\"He wants to be President\\".    The action in this movie is very well. You have gun battles, car chases, and of course martial arts fights. The fights in this are very well choreographed. It's obvious with the talent in this movie that all the guys have earned their living fighting   on screen, so the fights did deliver the goods.    Ireally enjoyed Stone Cold here and I thought he was the best actor in the movie as one of the main bad guys. He really did make you feel afraid of the guy. Stone Cold should get more roles like this in the future. The fight with Stallone was pretty awesome.    I also thought Randy Couture was great playing the comedy role here even though he also fought. What was the condition he had? Statham and Stallone playing the \\"Birdwatchers\\" was pretty funny.    My only minor nitpick is that there weren't enough villains in this. Aside from Stone Cold , Dolph Lungren, the secondary  villains were pretty weak. Even the General played by David Zayas he never fought, and he was there mostly for the drama with he and his blood. Originally Jean-Claude Van Damme was scheduled to be in the movie, but he declined this big opportunity. It would been great if Jean-Claude Van Damme was in it, but he didn't want to do it, so his loss. Also another bit part part for Mickey Rourke , but unlike Iron Man 2 he wasn't the lead guy, so I understand why he only had a small part here. However, the lack of more than two villains is made by the action and carnage onscreen which never lets up.    Other than than lived up to hype. If there's a sequel, I'll definitely go and see it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is by far one of the best Vampire movies I have seen in a long time. The story just sucks you in, very well written and directed. Some movies of this genre almost \\"rely\\" on great CGI or super fight scenes to help make them work and there is nothing wrong with that, but this movie certainly does not have to \\"rely\\" on those elements to help make it work. Now that being said this movie has some great special effects work but it doesn't need special effects as a crutch to help make it better. It doesn't need to, the story is written incredibly well. One of the things I love about this movie is the simplicity in which it was filmed. The acting by Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson is incredible, especially for their age at the time of filming. The movie has some just downright brutal scenes and at the same time you still feel such empathy for both characters. All I can say is WOW! This is a great movie!
1400032717|4.0|As you probably already know, this book is notable for being the first-person narrative of the life of an autistic boy: he starts out trying to investigate the murder of a neighbor's dog, and winds up in the middle of a family crisis. The protagonist, Christopher, also inserts into the text a variety of things that interest him: math and logic problems, discussion of space and astronauts, and so on.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this book is its unique point-of-view. While Christopher certainly can't be taken to represent everyone with autism, it's still interesting to read his thought processes and learn about how he sees the world. But beyond that, what I admired most about this book was its honest portrayal of how having a child with special needs affects a family. Haddon doesn't sugercoat it; this isn't one of those works that portrays special-needs children as a constant joy to everyone around them. It seems that a lot of reviewers despise Christopher's parents, but I see where the parents are coming from--I can't imagine living with him day in and day out for years on end--and I was pleased to see the author take a more realistic and sympathetic look at the family.<br /><br />Beyond that, I don't have a whole lot to say about this book. The plot and prose style are both quite simple, but that fits the story and the narrator. The most problematic thing for me was that Christopher shows no empathy for others; not only does he not understand emotions, he doesn't seem to care, and he doesn't seem to be attached to anyone around him. That may be realistic, but it makes for a very cold character. At any rate, this book didn't inspire any particular passion in me, and I'm not entirely sure why it's as popular as it is, but it was a quick read and I found it to be worthwhile.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I've obviously missed something that hundreds of reviewers loved.  Seeing so many positive reviews and seeing that it was published by Scholastic led me to believe this book was something that I would at least find interesting.  Children fighting to the death is sick.  If there are missed metaphors on my part, then so be it...at 59 with a Masters degree in Modern Studies this book didn't resonate on any level.  I haven't read so-called science fiction in many, many years and if this is the \\"new\\" science fiction then I guess I'll stick to historical fiction and the like.  I see nothing in this book to recommend it and am perplexed about its popularity.
B0015DROBO|2.0|slow starter, middle mystery fairly well paced if completely unbelievable. not very well written, not sure if that happened in translation, too much product placement and useless descriptions and not enough character development (just telling us someone's wearing a t-shirt with a \\"bad-ass\\" statement doesn't make the person bad-ass, niether does the riding a motorcycle, having tattoos). Resolutions of both story lines was very odd and was very neat and tidy (almost bow-worthy). the whole last section was beyond ridiculous. I honestly don't think I'd recommend this book and doubt I'll read the other two.
B003IODNJA|5.0|Propaganda's masterwork \\"A Secret Wish\\" still retains its edge 25 years on. Having owned all of its previous incarnations at one time or another, I'm looking forward to having this definitive work in my miniscule library of CDs that includes: Al Di Meola's \\"Soaring Through A Dream\\", Underground Resistance's \\"Rings of Saturn\\", Tony Drake's \\"Texture\\" among other hard to find works.    File under: Rare, Classic and Timeless.    ZTT Records from this era were immersive and subversive in their presentation. Always much to read, ponder and read again if not for the lunacy of ZTT svengali Paul Morley. Always much to look at when having none other than a young Anton Corbijn shaping the early ZTT aesthetic and creative direction. Of course, much to listen to with maestro Trevor Horn and his production unit, led by Stephan Lipson on this outing, overseeing the shape and sculpture of the music. A complete multi media presentation, for the time.     One can always wonder what could have been had ZTT given its full weight and strength to this release had it not been immersed in the whole Frankie Goes To Hollywood endeavor. (No, disrespect to FGTH, either!) Like many early acts on ZTT, careers were cut short, opportunities squandered, lawsuits filed.    ...so, I'm look forward to having this obsession put to rest. Once and for all, at least for the original vinyl mix of 'Jewel', which does sound much better as the lead up to 'Duel'.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|I been reading reviews for both Ozzy's new album and Zakk Wylde's new BLS album and i cannot believe people are saying that Zakk's album is better. I've been listening to both albums and i love both artists, but really open your EARS Scream is totally  awesome and Order of the Black is good but sounds just like any other BLS album. Ozzy sounds fresh and revitalized without Zakk's trademark guitar wails. The Ozzman is back rocking like the old days. \\"Scream\\" buy it!
1416955070|5.0|I loved this book. I went into it semi-expecting it to be just another paranormal YA - nothing amazing, but just an okay read. I was proven wrong within the first few chapters! This book drew me in and wouldn't let me go until the last word. I honestly really enjoyed it.<br />It is the story of Clary Fray (sorry if I misspell any of the names -- I listened to the audiobook, so I never saw their names in print!) and the two weeks of her life in which her mother dies and she discovers that she is a Shadowhunter (someone with powers to see demonic activity that would normally be invisible to other humans, and who hunts and kills these demons). She is brought to The Institute and introduced to Jace Wayland and brother and sister Shadowhunters, Alec & Isabelle Lightwood. Clary learns what it means to be a Shadowhunter and begins to discover her ability to draw magical runes. Clary and Jace begin to have feelings for each other, but Clary's \\"mundy\\" (mundane = normal human) friend, Simon, is in love with her, so this confuses things for the friends. As the story goes on, Clary learns much about her past, and the secretive, dangerous past of her parents and all the other members of the Clave.<br />This book was so exciting to \\"read\\" (listen to...)! At first the narrator's voice got on my nerves a little, but I quickly got used to her and settled into the flow of things. I found that I really liked Clary as a character. She's not the typical, whinny teenage girl you find in so many YA books nowadays. She's only 15, and yet she knows who she is. Even though she doesn't know anything about what she is at the beginning of the book, it's clear that she definitely knows who she is, and I really like that about her. It made her more interesting to read. I also really enjoyed reading Jace. His brash, abrupt, sometimes insensitive manner was refreshing and a great change of pace from the \\"I can't live without you\\" types of teenage boy characters you normally run into. It made him sexy in an unusual way. His facade was so over-confident that you just knew something would come along to crack it open at some point, revealing the sad, lonely boy he really was.<br />All in all, I truly enjoyed this first installation of the Mortal Instruments series. I can't wait to begin the second book, City of Ashes right away!!an unusual way.

B000PDYVVG|1.0|Yes, Gilbert's prose were written very well.  She is talented.  But, this talent has left her self-indulgent and spoiled.  I couldn't get past the first 10 pages of whining. And before I proceeded any further, I asked friends who read the book if the author arrives at any meaningful revelations or redemptions on her quest. Everyone responded with a \\"no\\". Spoiled author. Can't waste my time.
B0034G4OU4|2.0|Isn't it nice to have the time, the resources, and the money to be able to travel the world and rediscover life, love, and spirituality? We should all be as lucky as Elizabeth Gilbert. Her memoir, \\"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,\\" has sold millions, been on the \\"New York Times\\" Best Seller list for 158 weeks, and touched the lives of thousands. One of them was Oprah Winfrey, who devoted two whole episodes of her show to the book. I admit that I haven't read it, but I have done a little research on it and on Gilbert herself. I have to say, I don't much care for her or her story. Her journey of discovery, paid for by an advance on a novel she plans to write, seemed awfully selfish, for she had no real absences in her life; she was married, had an education, was a successful writer, and lived comfortably in New York. This wasn't enough for her?    The film \\"Eat Pray Love,\\" which adapts Gilbert's story and has her portrayed by Julia Roberts, tells us that no, it wasn't enough. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), who, in an early divorce settlement scene, gave me more reason to side with him than with her. She has an affair with an attractive and all-around nice young actor (James Franco), which she then ends in a brazen display of tears brought on by God knows what. She then decides that it's time to take a year off and travel the world, to reconnect with herself, to once again have a zest for life - in other words, to escape from all the good things she had but never appreciated. She proceeds to spend four months in Italy, where she happily eats as much pasta and pizza as she can, with a few Napoleons on the side. She then spends the next four months in an Indian ashram, where the tries her hand at meditation, apparently under the impression that God can be grasped in one fell swoop. Finally, she goes to Bali, where she's presented with, but not necessarily willing to accept, love.    Along the way, she just happens to meet a number of people. Never mind the fact that they all greatly impact her life, as such people tend to do in stories like this; it's a miracle they can all speak fluent English. One of them, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be from the great state of Texas. In Italy, she befriends a sassy Swede and a charming Italian, a couple who look like they stepped out of a Giorgio Armani ad. In India, she meets the Texan (Richard Jenkins), a loveably gruff old man whose every line sounds like it originated from a fortune cookie. He, of course, has his own tragic back story, although he only shares it at just such a time when it's most convenient for the plot. In Bali, she reunites with the obligatory wise elder (Hadi Subiyanto), the long suffering divorcee (Christine Hakim), and Felipe (Javier Bardem), who enters her life as men tend to do in most forgettable romantic comedies.    There's nothing about this movie that feels authentic, and that's what infuriates me; it has the gall to pass itself off as an autobiography. I don't care how accurate Elizabeth Gilbert claims it is (she said during a \\"Good Morning America\\" interview that it played like a \\"surreal home movie\\"). I don't believe her. This is the stuff of movies, not real life. Besides, she didn't visually document her journey at all - not a single photo, not a frame of film. All the more reason not to believe her. With so much doubt about the story's authenticity, and with Gilbert's questionable dismissal of the good life she so clearly had before making the journey, the film lacks any sense of spiritual enlightenment or emotional awakening; it comes off as little more than a portrait of a selfish woman on a sightseeing trip.    Julia Roberts is a wonderful actress, and even though I disliked the woman she played, I still thought she gave a good performance. Javier Bardem seems to be channeling the same dashing mystique he employed in the much, much better \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona,\\" which is to say he seems to be repeating himself, albeit competently. As for James Franco, let's just say that my mother has coined the perfect phrase for actors that display no range and speak in monotone lulls: \\"They've just gotten a Novocain enema.\\" I don't know what director Ryan Murphy told him, but whatever he said, it was terrible advice. Franco is usually a very reliable, very convincing actor. Ever seen \\"Milk\\"? Hell, ever seen \\"Spider-Man\\"?    \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is phony, contrived, and unpleasant, made worse by the fact that we're supposed to take it as fact. Don't bother sending me comments that I'm wrong and that everything in the film comes directly from Gilbert's actual experiences. I'm not going to believe you. If the filmmakers had followed the leads of the people behind \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" and \\"Letters to Juliet,\\" who had the decency to label their films as works of fiction, then maybe I would have appreciated it more. But then again, no, I wouldn't have; there's still the matter of Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quest for meaning and happiness was really an exercise in trendy New Age mantra-talk and selfishness. The more I think about the journey she made, the less I like her as a person.
0316776963|3.0|Let's start out with the good things about this book.  Each chapter can be a story unto itself, so its an easy book to pick up for a few minutes and put down again when you get busy.  You don't feel like you're stopping in the middle of the good part.  David is a great writer.  He's not the most eloquent or original writer on the planet, but he's not a big idiot either.  The book is a personal account, so the reader really feels like she gets a personal experience.  The parts that are funny, are really funny, especially if you are a fan of sarcasm, which I am.    The bad part, however, is bad enough to be a big disappointment.  For those of you who don't know already, the author is gay.  Big deal - no one cares.  Just like no one cares that I'm straight.  As long as its well written and entertaining, I could care less.  But when the author makes it a point to remind us of his sexual orientation in every chapter, it makes the book difficult to relate to unless you're gay or maybe grew up with a gay sibling.  Since neither of those scenarios pertain to me personally, it was difficult for me to really get into the stories in this book with constant references to the author's sexuality - just like I imagine he would get bored reading a story sprinkled with references to my sexuality.  Sexual orientation wasn't supposed to be the point of the book, but I think it turned out to be a strong theme throughout.    I wish the editor would have told David that he is funny enough, his stories are original enough and his writing is entertaining enough that he didn't need to make darn sure the reader was clear on the author's sexuality.  I think if the homosexual references were fewer, I would have been much happier with this piece of work.
B003L20IDS|4.0|If you love action, if you live for comedy, if you get a nostalgic high from the electronic beep-boop sounds of eight-bit arcade games like \\"Pac Man\\" and \\"Space Invaders,\\" then \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" is the movie for you. This is mindless filmmaking at its best - no messages, no agenda, no introspection, just pure juvenile fun from start to finish. It's adapted from the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but its style really owes more to video games, the structure fast and frenetic, the music loud and pulsating, the battles cool and choreographed, the visuals bright and bursting with creative digital effects. Watching this movie was a little like watching the 2008 adaptation of \\"Speed Racer,\\" a woefully underappreciated film that stirred within me sensations of excitement and awe. Simply looking at the film was an experience unto itself.    Michael Cera plays the title character in his usual unassuming way, perpetually caught in that gray zone between shy nerdiness and loveably eccentric. But then there are those select moments when he becomes an amped-up video game hero, fighting his opponents as if channeling his inner martial arts instructor. It's a surprisingly seamless transition. The only thing missing from these moments are shots of hands holding a game controller, the thumb of one hand furiously flying over the A and B buttons, the thumb of the other hand scrambling to push the up, down, left, and right arrows in the correct order. I've long since grown out of video games, but I fondly remember the days of the original Nintendo and Super Nintendo systems; my summer days were often spent in front of the TV, me trying to navigate Mario on his quest to save Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser.    I digress. Before Scott Pilgrim becomes a video game character, he's the bass guitarist for a Toronto-based band called Sex Bob-omb (a reference to \\"Super Mario Bros.,\\" thank you very much). Although he's twenty-two years old, he's dating a seventeen-year-old high school student, the always cheery Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). His band mates and their tagalong fan (Alison Pill, Mark Webber, and Johnny Simmons) disapprove. So does his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin). Then he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an American with a mysterious past and a routine of changing the color of her hair every couple of weeks (it goes from pink to blue to green). The two form a connection of sorts; one could even call it a relationship. Scott, of course, fails to tell Ramona about Knives. Likewise, he doesn't tell Knives about Ramona. This will no doubt come back to haunt him in due time.    But before that can happen, he must contend with Ramona's past, which literally comes crashing down onto him. Six guys and one girl, known as the League of Evil Exes, all challenge Scott video game-style for Ramona's affections. Basically, he must defeat them all if he's to continue dating Ramona. I will not describe every ex, nor will I describe every battle. I will say that the digital effects are put to their best use during these scenes. Every punch, kick, jab, and push makes a sound that's literally spelled out over the characters' heads, much like in the 1960s \\"Batman\\" series. Players summon forth advanced moves and supernatural abilities. Points rack up before our eyes. A one-up eventually floats in front of Scott, looking much like a \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" mushroom. Best of all is when an opponent is destroyed - their bodies explode in a mass of quarters.    Two especially memorable Evil Exes are played by Chris Evans and Brandon Routh. The former is a hotshot movie star who talks like a cross between Steven Segal and Clint Eastwood and is aided by an entourage of stunt doubles. The latter is a strict vegan whose diet has earned him super special abilities, such as glowing white eyes and the ability to read other people's thoughts. Villains are always so much cooler than the heroes. In this case, they're also quite a bit funnier, their rivalry with Scott overshadowed by their over the top personality quirks.    As is the case with most video games, it all comes down to the final boss. His name is Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), and he raises the stakes by putting not only Scott's life on the line, but also the future of Sex Bob-omb. Scott is eventually forced to reconsider his feelings for Ramona, since there seems to be a very dangerous pattern in her dating history. Is it her he must save? Or does he have to save himself first? Whatever the case, you can rest assured that it will involve a lot of bonus points and extra lives. No pause button, though. No need for one. \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" is a film that beautifully draws you into a fast-paced frenzy; to slow down would be to miss the point entirely. Like a real video game, it's an action-packed, colorful blur of sight and sound. I don't think I've had more fun at the movies all summer.
B003SJ4VJ6|1.0|I've now rented a number of movies that did not do well at the box office, but got amazing and rave reviews from amazon customers.<br /><br />This movie was horrible.  Terriby story points and dialogue \\"I don't stay with clients so I can keep a professional distance.\\"  Then he sleeps with the guys wife just because he got in his bed.  He's on the phone with someone he doesn't know after being chased by unknown assailants, and is told not to give the person on the phone any details about where he is, then they ask him for the room number and he gives it!  He tells someone he's a novelist, not an investigative reporter, then goes on to search for clues - literally on a bike in a storm.  Really?  Seriously?<br /><br />About being paranoid that there is a conspiracy.... I had someone tell me, just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean that they're not after me....
B001MW0J2O|5.0|First off: For all the people who commented on my posts. I've been absent on reviews because of ym soul-searching. Now I'm only reviewing albums I like.      MY REVIEW:    Animal Collective - \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\"    These guys know how to make good music.    That's simple all I can say about the album.    My favorite song is \\"Summertime Clothes.\\" But I also like \\"My Girls,\\" like many people.    Anyway, I'm giving this album five stars because it's a cool album that never leaves focus. It makes you lose touch with the real world, though. At least it did for me.
0143118420|5.0|[[ASIN:0143118420 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]<br /><br />This book is really great! I read it a while back and now because of the moving coming out with Julia Roberts and a great cast, this book attracted more attention from people who just don't get the depth, soul searching and spirituality. They just don't understand how a woman just wouldn't put up with complacency and social/traditional expectations. It took a lot of bravery to do what she did and deserves admiration for trying to find happiness and balance, God and yes, herself, her true self in her life.  This book reaches out to a lot of people, it is beautifully written. The people who don't get it, shouldn't have even picked up this book in the first place. This book is very inspiring and yes, feminist. A lot of women out there see parts of themselves in the Elizabeth, but unable or unwilling for one reason or another. She does what many of us would love to do so hurray for Elizabeth! She didn't give up or settle and found herself. In the process of that journey, she found an amazing life partner. I, for one, admire her and very happy for her. We all could learn something one way or another from her. Thank you, Elizabeth for giving us this book. The beautiful description of the colorful characters you met and friends you made during your journey and the most interesting places you visited. Wishing you and your 'now' husband a wonderful and happy life together.  Looking forward to more of your books.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Let me keep it short. This album is what Pink Floyd was about. Everything about them manifests itself in this album; great lyrics, great pinkfloydish music and Roger's voice and yet because of the bad blood between the two cults, this album is underrated. Give it a try and have a nice listen.

0575072636|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke is certainly one of the best writers of the 20th Century, in any genre.  Within the Sci-Fi universe, he is undoubtedly one of the best.  After reading a few pages of this book, putting it down was always difficult and I couldn't help but wonder why I had to wait until almost the end of my 38th orbit around the sun to finally read his work.  Not only was it suspenseful, unpredictable, and very entertaining, but more significantly, philosophical and thought-provoking as all great sci-fi should be.  Also, as a South African, I was thrilled to read the many S.A. references, with one of the pivotal characters being a Cape Townian, named Jan Hendriks.  Fortunately, S.A. fared much better in our reality as compared to Mr. Clarke's alternate future depicted in this wonderful, epic tale.  I'm glad he was at least wrong about that.  Nonetheless, I absolutely loved this book and look forward to reading it again....
0061714372|1.0|I have been a Megadeth fan since 1988 and was really looking forward to this book.  Unfortunatley, I came away very dissapointed.  As a fan of the MUSIC, I was hoping to get some insight into the creative process that drove what has been one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time.  Instead, in Dave's memoir, his actual MUSIC seems to take a backseat to the chronicling of a messed up childhood and a lifelong battle with Drugs. Ho-Hum. Yawn.    It's sad that the first book ever written about this band barely touches upon its amazing body of musical output and instead is just a standard \\"rags to riches\\" personal sob story type of book.    I really hope a real rock writer such as Martin Popoff, Joel McIver, or Jake Brown gets the opportunity to document the Megadeth story from a MUSICAL standpoint.  Particularly, what was going through Dave's mind as he created 10 of the most amazing heavy metal albums of all time (Risk and the lame debut \\"killing is my business\\" aside)...Maybe one day we'll get to see that type of book.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Oprah is a terrible narrator. If you like any of the BBC Plant Earth/Nature Documentaries, This U.S. version is terrible. The U.S. version also fades to black every five minutes for commercials that arn't there. Get the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough. Better narration, no black holes, excelent making of extras. I have both versions because I havn't sold my U.S. version yet. My wife and kids didn't want to finish watching the U.S. version beyond disk 1. Even the kids say Oprah sucks.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Anyone who compares this band to Joy Division has not only heard a deficit of Joy Division, they haven't heard a whit of bands like the Sound or the Chameleons or Kitchens of Distinction.  Interpol draws on their influences, but more importantly, they build on them.  They have created something that is their own.  This is one of the best debut albums I've ever heard, and I've heard a lot of music.  I've heard everything that Joy Division recorded.  Dismiss this album at your own peril; it is uniquely potent, and of a style, but with its own identity.  Years after it was released, this album still resonates.
0061128562|5.0|This story is absolutely charming. If you've never read it, you're missing out on a modern children's classic. I believe most children (and some of us adults) would adore both the storyline and the adorable illustrations depicting how exhausting it is to keep up with this easily-distracted mouse, who goes from activity to activity, leaving a trail of mess behind him. I for one can relate!    I do agree with an earlier review, though, that discusses how some of the illustrations get lost in the tiny book. If you're wanting to give this book to a child who's never experienced it, I'd go for the larger version for sure. This is great for the child who has already committed to memory the special details of the full-size book. Love that this particular package comes with a CD to further enhance the story.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Tim McGraw gently suggests early in this film that to discover the essence of a person you must peel the onion, one layer at a time.  The same applies to a well-made film like \\"The Blind Side\\".  When you get past the feel-good platitudes related to family, faith, and fan-dom, you arrive at the tragic tale of a gentle soul, desiring nothing more than to live and let live, like Fernand the Bull, heading for certain failure in one of the many competitive arenas that America holds so dear, high school football.  The key to excavating the \\"productive\\" violence within him is to remind him (through a series of violent black and white flashbacks to his childhood) of how angry he is at the hand the world has dealt him and to re-channel that anger into bashing heads on the football field.  This is the same formula employed so successfully by those fighting in an army, or trading on Wall Street, or seeking the Nobel Prize, or launching a website like Facebook.  The advice from Michael's crackhead biological mother is to close his eyes to avoid the pain.  But this is anathema to the coaches, college alums, and many parents whose highest value is \\"winning the game\\", so fate delivers a hard-driving surrogate mother (Sandra Bullock) to open his eyes and free the right tackle within him.

B0000640S3|3.0|Sylvester Stallone takes his one-man-army routine to Afghanistan in this enjoyable comic-book adventure that aims for a \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" grandeur but misses by a mile. Nevertheless, \\"Rambo III\\" (1988) is a better-than-average sequel, with expensive action sequences courtesy of director Peter MacDonald. Once again, Jerry Goldsmith's signature score keeps things moving. Solid chemistry between Stallone's John Rambo and Richard Crenna's Colonel Trautman, who finally participates in the explosive mayhem. Despite reviews to the contrary, some of the humor is intentional.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I purchased this pair of X41's as an upgrade to my X3's (now renamed X31's).  I have always been happy with my X3's, as they had rich, deep bass, and an overall good balance of high and low tones.  The only problem with them was the weak construction.  So I splurged for the X41's.  While I'm not totally blown away, it is an improvement.  Here are some of the pros and cons I have experienced with this particular product.  While most of the comparisons are for FPS games, I have yet to test this set on movies, action games or others.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The bass is not nearly as rich and enveloping as the X3's.  This may sound like a bad thing, but given the fact that the X41's produce much clearer high tones, it balances itself out nicely.  I can hear footsteps, static (game noise), bullets clinking on the ground, etc.  Explosions sound great.  For example, in Halo 3, I could hear static and hissing along with electrical noises in a destroyed ghost.  It was amazing!!<br /><br />The wireless is good as well.  I have a Linksys Wireless N Router about 4 feet from my Turtle Beach receiver.  I have not had any problems with too much interference.  I do turn off my computers and laptop when I use the headphones as a precaution.<br /><br />The headset is considerably lighter than it's predecessor, the X3.  The ear cups fit nicely, and are cool and comfortable.  It does seem as if it will need some TLC to keep them in good working order (i.e., putting them back on the stand after playing).  These are not headphones that you can just toss of your head in a fit of rage (already went through 2 sets of X3's that way...shameful =])  Treat them gingerly, and they will treat you well.  It even fit well over my nerd glasses. =]  No digging into my head after a few hours of gameplay.  The headband itself is much wider.  I have a small/narrow head, so I was skeptical as how they would fit me.  No worries though, they fit great.<br /><br />There is a removable mic, which is great if you want to use this with a PC or other kind of device.  It also features a separate headphone jack in the front, so a friend can listen to Dolby surround sound as well.  I hooked up a pair of SkullCandy Ti's to it, and it sounded great!  This is good for guests who play online (they cannot chat anyway).<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Occasional popping and hissing with these headphones.  I too concur that I experienced the infamous snap, crackle, pop of all the other reviewers.  While it's not constant, it does get annoying sometimes.  I cannot say that I am entirely disappointed either.  I bought a wireless headset.  It's bound to have some hiccups along the way.  The X3's also had a low humming/hiss as well, and when someone walked in front of the IR receiver, the sound would cut out completely!  The X41's are a definite improvement over the X3's in this matter.<br /><br />Shotgun blasts sound as if you were shooting them out of a tin can.  The bass is not nearly low enough for these particular sounds.  For example, the X3's shotgun blasts (on Halo 3) sound AMAZING.  A deep, guttural rumble that you can feel the vibrations from.  With the X41's, you get a higher, treble filled shotgun blast. You can hear the snap of the shells leaving the chamber, and the pump of the shotgun sounds more like a mechanical tinker than low series of deep click-clacks. This is just a nitpick.  The mauler (on Halo 3) sounds offensive at best.  Hammers, BR's, Assault Rifles all have amazing sounds.  Sniper rifle fire is accompanied by a whiz of the bullet (if being fired in your direction).  Reverb is also good on Sniper Rifles.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good headset.  I do not believe that it's worth the 160 dollar price tag.  I would say drop it to 100 bucks and it would be a great deal.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good headset, but strapped on cash, check out the X3's (X31's).  They are a good alternative for a smaller price bracket.<br /><br />Happy Gaming!!ther kind of device.

B0036TGSR6|1.0|As the old hip crowd gets older, they become what they once hated. Whether it's Woody Allan now cheering an Israel/Jew-hating Obama, or Roman imagining the CIA to be this incredible evil, it's shocking that these movies continue to be made. The fact that someone might have been with the CIA in his youth, and that BRAINWASHED characters do their bidding (to freedom's detriment, apparently) - distorts the natural kinship the few Western countries still have against terrorism. The great Golem, the CIA.<br /><br />That being said, the pacing is very fast and good, and much of the dialogue is intelligent. It's just the plot assumption that isn't. It's like the woman who has you breathless at first glance, leaving you to find later with 'the-morning-after' that the hair extensions, silicone in the super-bra, padding-in-the-panties, hot-outfit and make-up gave you the \\"wrong\\" impression.<br /><br />Here, the ASSUMPTION Polanski makes is that the audience will also be horrified to find that America's intelligence agency has similar goals to that of a British PM.  Roman shouldnt worry. Between Carter's Church Commission (1970s), which pulled the CIA's teeth and paved the way for Bin Laden, or the left-wing Clinton Stooge now in charge and further weakening that once-great agency, the CIA has also imploded, making room for transvestites, Jew-haters and muslim-terrorist protectors prancing down their once patriotic halls.

0307716988|5.0|I am a huge MJ fan and really enjoyed hearing his story from his own words. I do wish he would have written another book from between the time he wrote \\"Moonwalk\\" and before his death. He will be missed so much. Maybe he had planned on it later after his last tour. The book was an easy read and had a lot of information in it for a short read. The book really gives you an idea how brilliant he was and how he went about creating music along with his relationships with family, friends and the special ladies in is life. I like that he put in there little stories of his recording studio experiences that led to some of the greatest songs ever written. Another great plus to this book is that it has wonderful photos in it and not too many so you feel that you are getting enough read. Being an MJ fan I already knew some of the stories told but it was nice to hear it MJ himself. I want to read another MJ book but I am not sure which one to choose. I don't want to read one of those bogus books written by people that will put anything out there and a bunch of lies just to make money. Anyone have suggestion?
B000002GHH|2.0|Go ahead and click, \\"review not helpful\\"    Sorry...but...    There are plenty of artists that are virtually unknown and have much more powerful songs than John Hiatt's, \\"Have A Little Faith In Me\\"! Look up Tim Buckley, Mickey Newbury, Red House Painters, The Innocence Mission, Nick Cave, Mary Marget O'Hara and Kristin Hersh to name a few.     At 37 in 2010, I decided to finally check out John Hiatt, a name in the music world that just keeps popping up and I swear I can never place one of his songs. I downloaded his first LP from 1974 and found it to be made by a very talented person with too many ideas. So, I moved to what is considered by many to be his best, this one.    The whole album has a little too much \\"text book perfect\\" quality for me to truly enjoy. The lyrics are a little too, \\"Hey, I need to sell some records and impress people\\". The song, \\"Lipstick Sunset\\" is a good example of this. The album reeks of studio musicianship, feels very rehearsed as well as uninventive musically. There are some earnest songs and I'm sure he meant well but, I just can't get around the polished plastic. The improvements are near the very end of the album. This is an album for fans of the most commercial music by Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton. Springsteen came out with a brilliant lo-fi album named, \\"Nebraska\\", which changed my opinion on \\"The Boss\\". I wonder if Hiatt has something like that? I'd be much more inclined to check out more of him if he does. Some songs remind me of Stevie Ray Vaughan minus the great guitar playing.    The standout track would have to be \\"Your Dad Did\\" and then the highly unwarranted  fake sitar comes in and kills it. I really want to like this lesser known legend. Hiatt's voice also reminds me of Randy Newman and Elvis Costello, two artists that I can only appreciate in a scholarly kind of way. I'm not a big fan of their vocals at all. The song writing on this album also reminds me of the more commercial style Tom Waits had in the 70's. I'mglad Tom moved on from that style and went on to brilliantly reinvent himself into something I doubt Hiatt has ever touched on. Don't get me wrong, Hiatt is very talented, he's just not my style. It's ok music for hanging on the porch as the sun goes down at a BBQ. Make sure you have some PBR's!    And yes, I know Tom Waits doesn't have a \\"great\\" voice but, his song writting towers over Hiatt as well as Dylan and Young.    Go ahead, click: \\"review not helpful\\"
B002ZG980U|3.0|If you're reading this, chances are you've been exposed to the hype surrounding this film and might be misled to believe that there is something extraordinary about \\"Inception\\".<br />Let me straighten things out - this is not \\"The Dark Knight\\" of modern science fiction.<br />In its essence, \\"Inception\\" is the regular summer blockbuster Hollywood produces annually; The movie is no more than the typical shoots, explosions and CGI action flick - carried out in the context of a plot that has been marketed as more mature and complicated than usual - but there is nothing really groundbreaking under the sun.<br /><br />The story revolves around the efforts of a team of thieves that specialize in stealing ideas and secrets from the minds of people during their dreams.<br />The team leader, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, accepts the revolutionary task of planting  an idea inside the mind of a person (this is the \\"inception\\").<br />This endeavor is supposed to influence this individual to transform the planted idea to action in real life.<br /><br />The main memorable concept \\"Inception\\" purposes is that the brain thinks faster during a dream state. This might explain why some dreams give us the impression that they have lasted for many hours when in fact we have been dreaming for only a few hours in total.<br />I'm not sure about the scientific base behind this, but it proves crucial for the viability of the main action sequence of the film.<br /><br />In all, the focus of \\"Inception\\" is not on the acting, so expect a lot of action, confusion and alternate-fictional-realities, but don't expect any serious Oscar nominations coming January.
B003G4GMPO|5.0|Though having read all the Connelly paperbacks, I started reading the series again once I got my kindle.  Black Ice's been a fantastic return (after Black Echo), even after so many years.  I'd say it still stands out comparing to many 'blockbuster' thrillers. Having said that, Connelly's so good, any efforts to the films wouldn't be able to do him justice.

0307463745|3.0|Rework by Jason Fried provides an energetic and alternative view on the nature of work in the modern world.  The book is written in a series of fast paced sections around particular imperatives.  In many ways the book is a cross between Tom Peters, Seth Godin and the Clue Train Manifesto.  It is more like the mythical book Jerry McGuire wrote at the start of the movie in an effort to save his professional soul.<br /><br />The result is a type of manifesto that has already attracted a lot of attention and reviews.  The book is targeted at people looking to break their chains and start their own companies and some of the apparent paradoxes associated with running a successful company.  The imperatives concentrate on things you should do and avoid providing a nice overview of new styles of work.<br /><br />Its understandable that a book that reminds people that work does not have to be drudgery in the cubicle dungeon is pretty popular.  This book plays to that pop work culture with pithy imperatives that are about the size of a blog post and the author does run a blog.  They include imperatives such as:<br /><br />Ignore the real world<br />Planning is Guessing<br />Time is No Excuse<br />Failure is not a right of passage<br /><br />You get the picture.<br /><br />Rework is entertaining, thought provoking and a quick read.  Much of the advice you have seen elsewhere, just in a new skin.  So, if you are looking for how to make all of this work for you, in your environment, there is little help.<br /><br />There are many imperatives and naturally some of them contradict each other, which leads you to view the book as more mind candy and motivation than a set of ideas that you should put into practice.<br /><br />Some will say that I am asking too much of this book and others may be thinking that I do not get it.  I get it and have sought to build a work environment and teams around many of these imperatives.  However, recognizing books limitations is part of doing a good review.<br /><br />As a practical and actionable business book this is about a two star book, as a manifesto for change is a four star book - hence the three star review.  Recommended for people that need to recharge and rethink what they are doing and how you do it.<br /><br />One thing, the book is a tacit advertisement for the author's software company. Nothing too in your face and given the book is written from the author's ten years of experience which makes him about the same age as the Jerry McGuire character - experienced enough to know some things and yet still idealistic.<br /><br />The question is how is Jerry doing now, 14 years after his movie came out.<br /><br />You had me at \\"We have something new to say ...\\"bout a two star book, as a manifesto for change is a four star book - hence the three star review.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is an awesome cd. I personally think that it is brilliant! I was so excited to hear that Eminem was putting out another album and had to get it right away. I can't wait until he comes out with more. The transaction was fast and seamless and I recieved my cd quickly with no problems.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|This is the most violent film I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />Lucas Lee is a famous actor who DIES in a skateboarding accident after Scott dares him to grind a rail that leads to oblivion. No one seems to care that this famous actor has just died. No news report on his death. No ambulance. No signs of remorse from anyone. Nothing. Scott smiles and cheers when Lucas dies. He's proud that he KILLED someone.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is : Scott Pilgrim is a murderer who seems to only care about himself. He gets all whiny about some relationships and stuff, but shows zero remorse when he commits murder. This film's lack of basic logic is astonishing.<br /><br />The comic series (and I use the word \\"comic\\" lightly. Scott Pilgrim isn't worthy of being in the same category) is already bad enough. Now we have a movie?<br /><br />Do not buy this. Buy something good, like Twilight Eclipse.
0439023483|5.0|I finally gave in and decided to find out what all the commotion was over The Hunger Games series of teen dystopia.  I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced novel.  No, it's not going to win a Pulitzer, but it isn't intended to....and not every book has to be a literary masterpiece.  Take this book for what it is:  an attention-gripping dystopic novel for teens that combines sympathetic characters and a lightening-fast plot.<br /><br />I thought it was fabulous!  And hopefully, it will introduce the wonderful world of dystopia to new readers!
B000CNE092|5.0|I ordered this and it took a while, but that doesn't matter. I've always enjoyed this movie and the quality is amazing. the DVD wasn't damaged and I was able to watch it after several years. Go Amazon!
0439023491|4.0|While it is imperative to read the second book of a trilogy, it is rarely the best book of the three.  Catching Fire is no exception.  No spoilers here, except to say that the book is an almost exact replica of the first with a little bit of political rebellion thrown in, which sets the stage for the third and last book of the series.<br /><br />Don't expect any huge revelations in this installment.  But the Katniss's mother is more fleshed-out as a character (and is very enjoyable) and there are a couple of more character introductions who I hope will be making an appearance in the last book.<br /><br />All in all, a fast read and I wouldn't have missed it, but look at it as a bridge that you must cross to get to the third book.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|First off, I'm a huge SPN fan and I have all the DVDs and companion guides. Season 5 had the several most important things: good storylines, humor (Changing Channels anyone?) and most of all acting. Hats off to Jim Beaver especially for Dead Men Don't wear plaid-the big Bobby Episode, Misha Collins as Castiel the angel whose phone related issues are hilarious as well as everything in 5x17, Jensen Ackles as Dean who can pull so much emotion into one episode, and Jared Padalecki as Sam who pulled off great facial expressions and emotions. We had two new additions that were fantastic: Mark Pellegrino as Lucifer and Mark Sheppard as Crowley. We also had a few returns from beloved characters (SPOILERS) . . . . . . . . like Ellen, Jo, the Trickster, Pamela, Mary W, and even Ash. I definitely can't wait for this to arrive. A few of my favorite episodes include     The End  Changing Channels  Abandon All Hope  My Bloody Valentine   99 problems  Point of no Return  etc    I just love it all =D some were weaker of course but its always still a great show and season    SPN FTW!
B002VPE1OS|1.0|The stickers they have for seperating the film from the backing you can't remove it from the protective sheet after the product is on your phone. Leaves white mess you can't remove. You can't get all the \\"bubbles\\" out.  These are the worse protectors I have every purchased.  I am surprized and disappointed.  I thought the amazon product would be good.  I will NEVER purchase these products again...and will think twice before purchasing another amazon product.

B003X73QA8|5.0|This is a great album.  If you're like me, it may take you a few spins to get it. But it IS. And I'm not even an AF fan - in fact, I almost refused to buy this just because of the hype.  Gotta say - for once, the hype is right.    Most of the tracks are so good it's hard to single any out, but the ones I keep coming back to are \\"Month of May,\\" \\"Suburban War,\\" and \\"we used to wait.\\"
B003KTEGG2|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about Band of Horses. Infinite Arms is the best album I have listened to all year. If you like the Avett Brothers, Fleet Foxes, and the Shins, you'll like BOH. It's fun to start with their first album, Everything All the Time, and then listen to their second album, Cease to Begin, before moving on to their latest, Infinite Arms. Their sound has become more complex, yet also returns to the sound of some of their more mellow ballads of Everything All the Time. BOH also puts on a great concert - saw them at the Music Farm a few years ago.

0061714372|5.0|If you are interested in first hand accounts of the rock and roll lifestyle, stories of personal growth and victory, humorous anecdotes, or all of the above, this book won't disappoint!    Dave Mustaine is someone I've admired for a long, time - about 20 years.  And just like everything else changes in life, my reasons for admiring him changed and grew as he changed and grew.  As a teenager, I latched on to the intensity and energy of Rust In Peace and I never let go of my admiration for Mustaine.  Through changes in musical direction and band members, frequent drug relapses, an ongoing feud with another band I like (Metallica), etc., I continued to follow, and support (by purchasing CDs and concert tickets) Dave Mustaine and Megadeth.  You could say I was a loyal fan.  Dedicated in my support.  Perhaps even tenacious.  And tenacity is one big reason why I admire Dave Mustaine so much.  He has accumulated a lifetime of reasons to give up, spiral into an empty, bitter life or simply be dead already.  But he's not.  He's still here and this is his personal story of second chances, third chances, strife, success and redemption.    Being a fan of Megadeth, I was at least generally familiar with Mustaine's history; so I guess not much of the book surprised me.  If you want to paint with very broad brush strokes, you sum up his life story as not dissimilar from many other rock stars.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - right?  But throughout the book, you get this feeling that all the sensational and sometimes caricature-like anecdotes are being shared by someone who is in a better place now - someone who is wise only in the way that *he* can be, because he has learned from the experiences that only *he* has lived.  Mustaine's story is a personal story that you can relate to.  Even if you've never played a guitar or smoked heroin.    I had the opportunity to meet him briefly in 2001 and again for a little bit longer while in the studio in 2003.  When he sat down next to me and asked me \\"so what's up?\\" All I could think to myself was \\"what's up is your Dave Frickin' Mustaine and I'm a nervous fan who's more starstruck than I thought I would be in this situation\\".  But I wasn't just starstruck by my admiration for his musical ability, nor his music business savvy, nor the fact that he seemed to have a great, healthy family, nor even exclusively his tenacity.  It was the fact that this guy was simultaneously a success and a failure - he knows what it is like to be truly human.  He had often been a bad example as a person who wasn't the easiest to get along with, yet he has in him this inherent good side, a humble side - a vulnerable side, even, that is very refreshing.  Considering I can't relate to probably 95% of Mustaine's life experiences, I feel that he is still a completely 100% relatable guy.  To me, this autobiography reaffirms my conviction in our shared humanity and reaffirms my faith in God.
1572816112|5.0|I received this tarot deck today, and was shocked at how incredibly illustrated each card is. The artist really went to great lengths to make each card special and different. I've only done a few readings with this deck, but it's dead-on. I love it, and can't wait to do more tarot readings with this one. This is one special deck that is great for collectors and tarot readers alike!
B003O7I6L6|5.0|I have been having iffy results with many of the BR discs I've purchased recently... but, I am very relieved to have found this copy is just great! There is the most minor grain in the very darkest scenes, but nowhere near the amount to ruin watching. And the rest of the scenes are near perfect. When you consider this is from 1981, they did a magnificent job on this movie. Yes, there are no extras, but I don't care, I wanted a great copy of the movie in the proper screen width and I got it! Thanks to those who made this possible! - I may just get the Escape from L.A. now after all...
B003HKN52A|4.0|A no-frills DVD (first) edition - just as Elvis-That's The Way It Is, a document of Elvis in Vegas, led inevitably to Elvis on *tour*, we now have the VHS to DVD version.<br /><br />Just like it's predecessor, we learn zipp about Elvis Presley - just that he was a unqiue innovator in his field, had cosmic charisma, and was a true family man: his Father fills many frames in this movie. Maybe we *do* learn something of his personal crisis, as his wife and four year old daughter are conspicuous by their absence.<br /><br />So, the \\"extended Elvis family\\", if you will, is magnificently presented here, in multi-frame and massive sound (back up singers, back up groups, huge orchestra, playing three chords, playing complex big ballads; mixing old-time rock and roll with present-day rock: gotta say, \\"Burning Love\\", his hit-to-be is better than *any* '50s classic - except for perhaps, \\"A Big Hunk O' Love\\". He doesn't expel much CO2 over them - the grandiose arrangements and ridiculous overproduction don't help).<br /><br />What really floored me, 37 years later (I saw the film in New York City in 1973), was the genre overlapping. The absolute best sequence, ironically, is of \\"Sweet, Sweet Spirit\\", a number by the male Gospel group only, leads into the 1952, lowdown proto-rocker, \\"Lawdy, Miss Clawdy\\". So what? The same guys sing the tune!<br />The line from the song, \\"ball every morning\\", by 1972, surely did not relate to ballroom dancing, as it did in the '50s. Incredible. Bad taste? Maybe...but baby, that is rock and roll.<br /><br />Perhaps I spoke too soon. We *do* learn something about EAP, in that strange non-selcular to secular jump. He broke down barriers to entertain the folks.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|SiCKO is one of the best researched and presented indictments of a cruel system I have witnessed! Not only every American, but everyone who can read and write in our World today, should have access to this Film. I believe it should be shown to every School Student in the USA, for apparently, they may be the only ones who can, and will have to demand the Nationalization of their Health System! For the sake of the better Health of every American, someone in a responsible position, with backbone, should grasp the Nettle now, and help President Obama to achieve it as soon as humanly possible!<br />It is sickening to learn how Americans got this uncaring Health System, and how it is dispensed. It is just as sickening to have had at least one of our ex Prime Ministers (John Howard) promote and achieve our current Health System which is 60% American and 40% Nationalised (60% for profit & 40% Serviced by the Public Sector).<br />If the Government of USA needs a Role Model, then they need look no further than Cuba, England, France or Canada.<br />Ever grateful to Michael Moore for the humane manner in which he presented victims of a rotting system telling their own true stories!<br /><br />Gordon Rogers<br />NSW Australia
B000024J7B|5.0|\\"The Great Escape\\" from 1995 has been called third stage of Blur's Life/Brit-pop trilogy that began with \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\" (1993) and \\"Park Life\\" (1994). The band went after these three albums for a simpler and less produced expression.<br /><br />Without being quite as consistent as its predecessor \\"Park Life\\",  \\"The Great Escape\\" remains as one of milestones among Brit-pop albums. With Damon Albarn in the lead Blur continued the English pop-songwriting tradition, which was started by people like Ray Davies and Pete Townshend in the 1960's.<br /><br />The album includes some of the group's biggest hits such as \\"Country House\\", \\"Stereotypes\\" and not least the band's possibly greatest song, the grand ballad \\"The Universal\\" - a track which alone is worth the whole album.<br /><br />Other tracks that lift the album up to belong among the greatest albums of its time are the delicate ballad, \\"Best Days\\", while \\"Top Man\\" and \\"Charmless Man\\" both have charm and bite.<br /><br />Some of the album's less catchy tracks, can be seen as advance warning of what was to come from the band on their subsequent albums; this applies for, to pick out two, \\"He Thought of Cars\\" and \\"Globe Alone\\"
B002ZG99A4|5.0|there's so much to say about this masterpiece it's hard to begin. with the exceptions of mickey rourke, bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger, every actor has at least 1 showdown with another. this is truely an action movie of 1980's caliber with exaggerated muzzle flashes and huge explosions and bad one liners. great movie. go see it relive the glory days of the 1980's and leave the kids at home for this. ok mr. stallone let's see another mission for your crew.

0743290119|1.0|I say \\"immature\\" because the characters were childish (under-developed) and the parts that were supposed to be funny came across (to me) as juvenile.I even wonder if this book was one of Lauren Weisberger's early efforts (before she found her rhythm) that got published now to take advantage of the success of her other books.     There was way too much going on in this book with the three main characters.  As has been pointed out by other reviewers none of them were developed very well.  It might have been more enjoyable to emphasize one character in the book and make the other two supporting.      I have enjoyed Lauren Weisberger's other books so I was really surprised that 5 pages in, I was already irritated with the characters.  I did my very best to stick this one out, thinking that it would get better but it did not.  2/3 into the book, I couldn't stand it anymore so I threw it away.  If you still find yourself wanting to read this book, I would say (as have others) to check it out from your local library and save your money.

The clever graphic artist/author entertains with her visual inventiveness, and manages to delight the eye and the brain at the same time.

I found my first copy at the Museum of Modern Art Store, and bought the next two copies at Amazon for about half the price!
B0021L8UPS|1.0|This is yet another in an endless parade of films made by people who seem to think that, if they startle the audience, then that counts as scaring them. There is nothing remotely suspenseful or terrifying in this film, except that you never quite know when an evil child, or a cat, or some other unseen entity, is going to pop up out of nowhere, with of course a deafening thud on the soundtrack and a jarring splat of music.     If you consider that great horror movie making, then by all means, check this movie out.
1416550550|4.0|With hints of Dickens, Du Maurier and Hodgson Burnett, Kate Morton delivers an eminently readable tale. The story involves three women,(Nell,Eliza and Cassandra) three time frames and a myriad of characters who lay the framework for solving  a mystery of an abandoned  child's true identity. Within this mystery, there  lies  a homage to imagination and ,in particular, to fairy tales. With hidden gardens, mazes, beautiful maidens, evil characters,and stately manor houses we are taken on the journey of Nell's  self discovery. At times the  location  and time period changes get in the way of the fluidity of the story but for the most part the reader is driven to read on  to uncover the complete  story of Nell, the abandoned child who is at the heart of this tale.Although I discovered the secret early on, Morton did give enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing and  turning pages.At times, Morton's fragmentary sentences were a bother to me. She was at her best in her fairy tales which could stand on their own as  a children's book.When all the ends are tied together, the reader will need a tissue to wipe away a tear or two. The Forgotten Garden will be a favorite  as it appeals to the inner child in all of us who long to hear the wonderful, magical and scary fairy tales of our younger days.
B00064WSN2|4.0|\\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" has been criticized for reminding a little too much of its predecessor, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Well, of course, there are similarities but also significant differences. Is it, by the way,  that bad to point out a masterpiece like \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\"?<br /><br />A melodic and almost acoustic number like \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" is a kind of song you won't find on the predecessor, so already here you will find a difference between the two albums. This song is also one of the group's most moving, and my clear favorite in this album. Overall, the album more is boundary pushing than its predecessor, which, apart from parts on \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", is relatively accessible. \\"Pictures of a City\\" has similarities with that number, but the verse is more entrenched in the blues, while the instrumental part is more experimental.<br /><br />The title track \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" is probably the track which is immediately recalling \\"Crimson King\\" the most; with its grandiose melotron and a slowly flowing melody.<br /><br />The single \\"Cat Food\\" might be compared to the Beatles' \\"Come Together\\" - obviously a little more jazzy and experimenting.<br /><br />The long instrumental \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is for hardcore fans, I think, and obviously not the song you introduce to your friend first.<br /><br />Three short tracks titled \\"Peace\\" are scattered throughout the album - quite nice, but apart from \\"Peace - an End\\" too short to really make any difference.<br /><br />Two bonus tracks are the single version of \\"Cat Food\\" and the b-side \\"Groon\\", which is a jazzy instrumental.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  I've listened to it many times and have enjoyed all the songs.  I particularly like \\"My Love\\" and \\"Let's Get Lost.\\"  There is a good variety of sounds...slow, hypnotic, catchy tunes, good drum beat, rock...all enjoyable.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Back in the day, I was a fan of Star Trek. Later, I watched many but not all episodes of New Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. I planned to watch this movie eventually, and put it on my gift wish list. Someone finally bought it for me. I was pleasantly surprised by parts of it, but disliked other parts.    In the opening sequence,I enjoyed the initial introduction with Kirk's Father/Mother and Spock with his Mother and Father. As someone else said, the opening sequence was \\"stunning and emotional\\". I HATED the boy Kirk and bad boy Kirk in the academy especially his coming on to Uhura, the bar fight, and the segment about Kobyashi Maru (beyond pathetic). I almost gave up on the movie. My husband turned thumbs down and left the room. I kept watching and it improved. I was surprised that I enjoyed the Uhura/Spock romance and various changes in other characters. That is what was unexpected. The acting and cinematography were good.    Overall, the plot was too over the top for my taste. So Nero came back to the past and didn't bother to save his planet! Huh! I never cared for time travel stories as plot devices, and this one is no exception.The Kobyashi Maru scene was a great disappointment. It could have been so much better. My rating is more of a 2 1/2 stars out of 5 because the plot was often way too silly and melodramatic. I suggested that my husband finish watching the movie some day when he doesn't have anything else to do, and that he try to overlook some of the hot shot Kirk scenes.
B003INBOEC|5.0|Really, damn! In the realm of martial arts cinema, it really doesn't get more compelling than this movie. IP MAN, riveting and strewn with electrifying martial arts sequences, propels Donnie Yen to that summit of Asian action cinema (scooch over, Tony Jaa). IP MAN tells the semi-biographical story of the grandmaster of Wing Chun and, later in life, mentor to Bruce Lee. IP MAN presents a historical human drama, set in the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the story draws you in, but I think this has more to do with Donnie Yen's powerhouse performance more than anything else. I agree with those who say that this is Donnie Yen's finest work.<br /><br />The harshness of the Japanese occupation will draw out hisses. It's hard not to sympathize with the populace of Foshan as lives become reduced to a state of poverty so abject that starving men volunteer to fight for the Japanese general's entertainment, all for a single sack of rice (should they win). Ip Man himself, widely regarded as the best martial artist in Foshan, finds his skills useless under Japanese rule and he struggles to support his family. Donnie Yen as Ip Man is grace under pressure, cultured and principled and self-deprecating (and, okay, maybe a bit detached). It takes a wanton act of brutality to turn him into an instrument of vengeance. And when Ip Man finally loses his cool... well, it sets the stage for a sequence of pure assownery. Donnie Yen's wing chun is dynamic and exciting, and he's so fluid in action. I have to say, at this point, that whoever came up with the wonderful score deserves a lot of credit. The score not only adds dramatic impact to the story but lends even more tension to the combat scenes. But you'll hear in the bonus features that even longtime practitioners of the wing chun discipline are raving about Donnie Yen's technique. It's surprising to learn that, before IP MAN, Donnie didn't know too much wing chun. He trained in it for the nine strenuous months leading up to the film's shooting.<br /><br />Donnie Yen gets a great supporting cast: lovely Lynn Hung (in her film debut) as Ip Man's long-suffering wife (she loves her husband, can't stand it when he fights), Simon Yam as the cotton mill's distinguished owner and Ip Man's friend, and Fan Siu-Wong as Jin Shanzhao, the scruffy, over-aggressive martial artist from the north who challenges - and annihilates - the best martial arts schools in Foshan (until, in a thrilling contest, he eventually gets spanked by Ip Man). And if you don't absolutely end up loathing the sadistic Japanese colonel Sato, then actor Shibuya Tenma didn't do his job near well enough.<br /><br />Ip Man early on is reluctant to take on students, and it isn't until the Japanese invasion that he starts teaching the basics of wing chun to the bullied cotton mill workers. What I appreciate is the touch of realism that went into the scene in which the bandits return to the mill and the workers initially apply what wing chun they've learned but then quickly go back to cowering when they realize that they're still not cut out for serious brawling.<br /><br />My favorite moment has to be Ip Man simultaneously taking on ten Japanese fighters. But, oddly, my second favorite scene is when the fight between Ip Man and a challenger is put on pause when Ip's young son comes wheeling around in his bicycle to remind his dad that mom said not to break things in the house. This funny little moment was so unexpected, but it was a breath of fresh air, and it makes me like the movie that much more.<br /><br />There is some contrived melodrama featuring two brothers we don't really care about, and there's plenty of Japanese bashing that goes on here. But, hey, it's a Chinese film, so a measure of nationalism is probably expected. I don't know how faithful this movie is to Ip Man's biography. I wouldn't be surprised if certain liberties were taken. But I look at this movie more as a martial arts fable, and whether the story straysfrom what really happened or not sort of gets swept under the rug when you factor in the excellent acting, the stirring martial arts, and the superior production values. Yup, I'm calling it: IP MAN is simply a great movie.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition comes in 2 discs, with all bonus features available with English sub-titles. Disc 1: the film presentation; \\"Making Of\\" featurette (00:18:32 minutes); 3 Deleted Scenes (one of which informs us of Jin Shanzhao's final fate); the English trailer and the original theatrical trailer to IP MAN.

B000002UEB|5.0|I normally dont listen to this type of music at all. It came from the 80's so that in itself was a reason why I probably never listened to this until recently. To me queensryche was thrown in with the hairbands of the time. This is not a hairband at all I now have learned. At first listen it may seem like it is but keep listening. The singer is the only thing that slightly resembles anything of an 80's hairband. The music itself is very progressive and has the feel of a pink floyd the wall type of concept album. The countless 5 star reviews are what finally led me to head to the library and pick it up. Took me two listens and I was hooked. The instrumentals are very good. Very similar to maiden or priest yet not as heavy. The songs by themselves are very very catchy and addictive. All of them being really good. The singer has a superb singing vocal range. The album flows without making you reach at all for the skip button. I am so glad i decided to give this a chance. I am tempted to check out other albums by this band but judging by the reviews I believe this may be their pinnacle which I would have to agree is pretty high on the level of superb rock albums.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS. No other name in Horror inspires more fear. Over thirty years later, JAWS has proven to be one of the most terrifying film-going experiences of all-time, leaving behind a profound social impact and a permanent imprint on pop culture. It has become cliche for film fans to claim JAWS as being the scariest movie they have ever seen, but few other entries have ever come close to generating the same levels of tension, gut-wrenching horror, and suspense. JAWS is a masterpiece in the cinematic medium that reshaped the Horror genre for decades to follow.<br /><br />\\"You yell 'Barracuda,' everyone says 'Huh? What?' You yell shark... we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.\\" -Mayor Larry Vaugh<br /><br />JAWS taps into a raw, primordial fear of the unknown. The endless depths of the ocean hidden under its glassy surface could conceal any number of unseen horrors. Unlike in THE WOLF MAN or DRACULA, where victims came face to face with the monsters in some far away village set apart from reality by time and space, JAWS brings terror to the surface in our daily lives. As we find out in two of the earliest sequences, a trip to the beach can turn into a nightmare in seconds, as nature's apex predator strikes without warning or provocation. The viewers, much like Amity's beach-going vacationers, are given no hints as to the horrors they are about to experience, but for an arrangement of strings that are enough to send anyone's heart racing.<br /><br />\\"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies. Farewell and adieu you ladies of Spain.\\" -Quint<br /><br />If any single example had to be chosen to prove the importance of a musical score on the overall effectiveness of a film, it is John Williams' award-winning work in JAWS. No other film score has resonated so powerfully with audiences. From the exhilarating \\"One Barrel Chase\\" during the high-seas game of cat-and-mouse, to the ominous strings of the title theme, the music in JAWS accounts for half of the film's success, driving an emotional response from the audience in each of the most vital sequences.<br /><br />\\"You know those eight guys in the fantail launch out there? Well, none of 'em are gonna make it out of the harbor alive.\\" -Hooper<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, and Roy Scheider provide the defining performances of their collective careers, while establishing three of the most iconic film heroes in the genre. They are honest portrayals of rounded and fundamentally human characters, complete with a wide range of emotions and flaws. Even the noble and selfless Chief Brody suffers from his personal struggle with alcohol throughout the film, while Quint's crass conduct has kept him ostracized from the people of Amity. The supporting characters and nameless beach-goers each contribute infinitely to the film's impact as well, adding small but memorable movie moments attributable to individuals that don't even share a line of dialog. What dialog and exchanges that do carry through from the script are simply brilliant, leaving behind an endless supply of quotable lines that have had a lasting effect on pop culture to this very day.<br /><br />\\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\\" -Chief Brody<br /><br />JAWS moves far beyond the boundaries of any one genre, combining elements of action, adventure, drama, and horror, with light touches of humor to offset the otherwise frightening mood. It is not a proven classic because of a few scary scenes with a man-eating shark, but for the exceptional acting and filmmaking that went in to the production. Commenting on the physical direction and cinematography of the picture would literally require a master's thesis to fully examine the work that went in to making this film a success.<br /><br />Spielberg is not unlike a magician with the camera, a master illusionist who frequently uses misdirection to set up each of the most terrifying moments. What sets him apart from so many other directors is his close attention to detail and the subtle nuances he instills in his films. A key example of this can be found in a brief but highly effective shot taken in the police station, where Chief Brody is filling out the Death Certificate for Christine Watkins. Spielberg cuts close, focusing on the typewriter, as Brody hammers in the the death tolls that spell out \\"Shark Attack\\" under the cause of death.<br /><br />\\"This shark, swallow you whole.\\" -Quint<br /><br />Through creative framing and dialog, Spielberg drops many hints as to the final outcome of the film. As Quint, Hooper, and Brody depart on their gallant quest, the camera trails the Orca through a set of shark jaws Quint has hanging in an upstairs window of his workshop. This clearly signifies that our heroes are venturing out into the jaws of the beast, and foreshadows what is to come. Watching closely, a meteor shower can also be seen aboard the Orca in one of the night scenes, a wonderful touch that also proves that this is a fateful journey. For Quint, fate may not have worked in his favor, but it is only fitting that he should be taken in the same manner as his fallen friends and fellow soldiers aboard the USS Indianapolis.<br /><br />\\"Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water. Our shark.\\" -Quint<br /><br />What would JAWS be without a 25-foot Great White shark hungrily prowling the beaches of Amity Isle? The shark (aptly named 'Bruce' after Spielberg's lawyer) actually plays a comparatively small (though pivotal) role in the overall scope of the picture, as its presence remains implied for the majority of the run time. And yet, the shark tends to be the one thing for which the film is most fondly remembered. This isn't hard to imagine, as the shark's jarring arrival late in the film has shocked new viewers since its original theatrical release. Its stiff, rubbery appearance is completely forgotten due to the effectiveness in which the giant puppet is used. Though the shark may not resemble the exact features of a Great White, its stylized design, prominent dorsal fin, and gaping jaws are what most people think of when they hear \\"Shark!\\"<br /><br />\\"Smile you son of a bitch!\\" -Chief Brody<br /><br />JAWS is a study in film and storytelling, of character archetypes, of modern myth. It is a triumphant achievement that will be looked upon for centuries to come by creating fear in its purest form through the lens of the camera. Its influences on Horror cinema in the decades that followed are unmistakable, spawning countless imitations and sequels. One thing is for sure: JAWS kept people out of the water.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesn be found in a brief but highly effective shot taken in the police station, where Chief Brody is filling out the Death Certificate for Christine Watkins.

0375757422|5.0|I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in her  [[ASIN:0345442121 Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography]] (a wonderful piece of writing too).  And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.    Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.     All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her.  But aren't we all?    The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way.
B0000029AP|5.0|I must beging by saying this: I am an Aerosmith fan since I was 10 years old and their music is part of my soundtrack (sort of speak), but I knew the band when they release the Get a Grip album, because I was born in the mid eighties! So when i started listening to their old records I was more an more in love with these tunes.   Toys in the Attic is, without a doubt, one of the best materials of this legendary band. From the original version of Walk this Way, to Sweet Emotion, and Adam´s Apple this record is simply AMAZING. Steven Tyler´s incredible an unique voice along the classic riffs by Joe Perry,and the performace, just the rare \\"click\\" of the entire guys (Tom, Joey and Brad). Classic, pure rock from the best age. The 70´s!
0307346617|4.0|I'm not normally a zombie genre reader, so I'm not quite sure why this book caught my eye in the bookstore... World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War by Max Brooks.  Perhaps it was the \\"first person account\\" angle of the story, where the world has barely survived a worldwide war against zombies.  Whatever the case, this was an entertaining read with enough room to let your mind imagine what what it might be like to fight an enemy that won't \\"die\\" like normal people.<br /><br />The setting of the book is around 10 to 15 years after the outbreak of the first zombie attacks.  The \\"author\\" was tasked with gathering information from people who survived the war, and that information was to be part of a UN report.  But most of his material ended up being cut as it was \\"too personal.\\"  Rather than lose the stories of how people were personally affected, he decided to publish his interviews as a human record of events.  Thus, he created the oral history of the war.  He talks with a wide spectrum of individuals, from government officials who had to \\"manage\\" the public perception, to soldiers who were fighting a relentless and mindless enemy, to those who were just trying to cling to whatever fragments of society remained.  With every new interview comes a new angle and perspective to the conflict.<br /><br />Since this doesn't cover the blow-by-blow history of the actual war, you do need to let the interviews unfold and fill in the details of what started the outbreak, how it spread, and how people mobilized to fight the zombies.  And if you stop and think about it at various points, the logistics of fighting zombies that just won't die unless their brains are destroyed presents unique challenges.  If one zombie finds you, his moans attract others within hearing distance, which starts their moaning calls, and it cascades from there.  In short order, you could have thousands of zombies advancing on you, with no thoughts other than to feed on you and turn you into one of them.  Not a pretty thought...<br /><br />You do have to make some leaps of imagination at points, however.  For instance, during one of the interviews, the author goes on a deep-water dive in a submersible.  When they get to the bottom, they find... what else?  More zombies!  So apparently these undead don't need air, can avoid the corrosive nature of salt water, and are not affected by the crushing pressures at the bottom of the ocean.  But hey, it's not as if writing about zombies is an exacting science anyway, right?  :)<br /><br />I personally found World War Z one of those quirky but enjoyable reads.  It may not fit everyone's taste, but if you're OK with the \\"undead\\", you'll probably like it.  I still have to laugh at my wife's statement when she saw what I was reading, however... \\"You sure do have eclectic tastes in reading material...\\"<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Bookstore<br />Payment: Purchasedetty thought...

Sure, it's a happy album (except for like 3 tracks) but it doesn't matter because anything Goldfrapp makes is awesome!I always keep coming back to Rocket and Alive.  This may not be the masterpiece Felt Mountain is, but Goldfrapp fans know that they never do the same thing twice.As long as Goldfrapp keeps creating new music without repeating themselves, I am happy!
B002GJU54E|4.0|I love that the Stephanie Plum series is set in New Jersey. I learned alot about the Pine Barrens in Plum Spooky, an area of my native state that I'm not too familar with. However, there were 2 references to Stepanie (& Diesel) pumping gas in that book, a fact that any Jersey Girl would never want to do (besides, it's illegal to pump your own gas in New Jersey). Other than that, I love the outrageous characters and plots of Janet Evanovich's books.
B001EN71DG|1.0|I was eight when the first one came out, and all my friends were \\"into it\\".  Of course, everyone was raving about it -- even adults.  However, I remember sitting in the theater bored stiff waiting for an interesting story to unfold.  I was very disappointed.  I even went to the second one a few years later and was again disappointed.  There was nothing engaging about the Star Wars films at all, and why they are still revered all these years later as great movies baffles me.  My reasons for not recommending these films are listed below:    a.)  Too much BAM! and BOOM!  --  These films are extremely noisy and irritating.  If you like explosions and fireballs, and things blowing up, then maybe it's for you; however, if a lot of irritating noise, music, and sound effects get on your nerves, then skip them.    b.)  Cardboard characters  --  Come on... Just look at some of the names... Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Hans or Han Solo (can't remember which).  My six year old nephew could have thought up better names.  The characters themselves are all flat and one dimensional.  There's no life or spirit in them.  They're predictable and dull.  The only character who has any substance at all might be Obi-(Wan or Won)-Kenobi, and that's probably because the actor (who is actually quite good) playing the part tries in vain to give him life.  Unfortunately, there's not much he can do with the insipid script, but at least he tries!    c.)  Egregious writing  --  There's not much to say about this.  Between the BAMS and BOOMS and all the explosions, the characters engage in lame, predictable dialogue.  Some of the one liners by Han or Hans Solo are expected to elicit mirth from the audience, but this is only to divert the attention of the viewer from the terrible shortcomings of the plot and quality of the films.    d.)  Special effects  --  Okay, I know a lot of money was spent in creating the special effects, and that \\"NOTHING ELSE HAD EVER BEEN DONE LIKE THIS BEFORE!!!\\"  But nothing is left to the imagination.  It's all thrown at you quickly and with such noise and thunder that one gets the feeling of being cheated somehow.  There is nothing atmospheric about the effects here.  Lots of fireworks but little else.      Overall, these movies were incredibly dull with silly characters and a lot of empty noise sprinkled with fireballs and spinning spaceships.  These were typical \\"market\\" movies intended to bilk the imaginations and purses of a gullible public.  Unfortunately, they succeeded only too well.

B002IR3PSC|4.0|Wow, I couldn't wait to see this show.  After I opened the box and placed the DVD in the player this wonderful concert began much to my expectations.  Considering the age of the venue and the technology of its time the audio and video was very good.  I saw Jethro Tull three years earlier in Columbia, SC with the Amazing Alex Harvey Band opening for them.  Other than Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond departing the group the members were the same!  I highly recommend this DVD to others especially to those who enjoy seeing Ian Anderson up close and working the crowd.  Martin Barre rocked, John Evan was his comical self while demonstrating his keyboard mastery and Barrimore Barlow was tightly keeping tempo. This concert had a session bassist (Tony) filling in for Gordon Glascock who was in poor health at that time.  The shipping was efficently done and the condtion of the DVD represented what was advertised.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|Here's another instance where everybody & their grandma's already chimed in on 2012, but the film ties in with many ideas relevant to my internet site, so...<br /><br />The whole Maya calendar thing is more or less already imploding in on itself--since it wasn't \\"real\\" to begin with, so there's no point going into that. Suffice it to say that in the film there are pockets of people (mostly scientists, eccentrics & the mega-rich) who are in on the secret that Armageddon will be 21. December 2012. Apparently not even the US President (Danny Glover) knows until it's too late. So the movie is all about special effects (which I didn't feel were THAT spectacular--for the exception of the ocean scenes that had a sort of beauty all their own), and one implausible--impossible-- scene after another. 2012 stars John Cusack (an actor who usually projects a pleasnt personna), but, again, his numerous near escapes from death are so repetitious as to be ludicrous, and his character is lost in a very thin script that demands suspension of believability.<br /><br />Only a Steven Speilberg could have saved this movie with all its cliches & poor attempts at audience manipulation; they even throw in a Dali Lama who actually bears a pretty good resemblance to the real one. Another strange example of this involves a character introduced early on. He is s sort of crazed hippy prophet of 2012. He befriends Cusack's character & so it is odd that he is allotted an ingominious end. He is standing on a mountaintop where he is supposedly chronicleling The End. He drops something, bends over to pick it up, with the crack of his ass prominently showing. Then he's pulverized along with the moutain.. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny, or it was some sort of commentary on the character. Whatever, it was just silly.<br /><br />I'm usually a sucker for the sentimental, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about these people. They were trite & seemingly pulled from central casting. You start to get a glimmer of relationship towards the end, but it's too little, way too late.<br /><br />2012 is rated PG & that's good because only kids--might--really enjoy it.f relationship towards the end, but it's too little, way too late.     2012 is rated PG & that's good because only kids--might--really enjoy it.

B002ZG997C|1.0|Pitiful and bogus is this post-apocalypse flop that lies sick and diseased in a ditch with it's gross twin, The Road.

1600243916|4.0|Gladwell is one of the preeminent storytellers of our generation.  Its just a joy to listen to him tell anecdotes, including one about his own family.  This is where he's at his best.  I don't entirely agree with his conclusions, in that I believe individuals do do extraordinary things with the opportunities they are given, whereas he seems to suggest that they are simply hard workers given the opportunity to work hard.  As a kid, Bill Gates had an opportunity to use a computer at a lab when it wasn't being used at 3am to 6am in the morning.  Yes, it was an extraordinary opportunity, but he was also extraordinary to seize it, trudging to this lab in the middle of the night on his own volition when he could have easily coasted into a comfortable life without having to work very hard at all.  Nonetheless, the book is a fine antidote for the myth of the \\"self made man\\" that we have.  But the real strength of the book is just in the richness of the storytelling.  The cultural reasons that planes crash and the lucky breaks that the Beatles got in logging a huge amount of hours as live performers.  No one tells a better story than Gladwell, its time well spent listening to him.  The first section on hockey players is so simple that what takes a half hour to explain could be summed up in 5 minutes, but other than that and the fact that my conclusion is that outliers are special folks perched on special circumstances outside their own doing, rather than his that they are primarily hardworking ordinary folks which seems to be his, its a great listen.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|I love a good scary movie (Halloween, Omen, Exorcist etc.) this one is a stinker tho. The concept is actually quite good. But the writting is so poor and the charactors so stupid, it completley destroys the movie. There have been brainless can't connect the dots parents in several movies, however the father in this one (beyond walking through the film in an almost comatose stupor) and the dumber than dirt psychologist don't have the brains of a fruit fly between them. These are charactors that would be bewildered by the complexity of Tic-Tac-Toe. Painfully obvious to them isn't, it's baffling - transpose the IQ of a hampster into a grown man or woman and then cut it in half. Then there are glaring holes in the plot where charactors actions (or lack of actoins) simply don't make sense. You can't help but think to yourself (or mutter to the movie screen) \\"Nobody is that dumb\\". But, they are. Like I said at the start, the premisis is actually good and a good film maker and screen writer with a smattering of intelligence might have turned this in to a nice film, but the charactors in this one are so incredibly can't walk and chew gum at the same time stupid that you spend the whole movie making fun of them instead.
0670034711|5.0|I remember when this book came out. I remember hearing about it, and seeing it all over the shelves of book stores. I remember seeing it....and running the other way. I don't know WHY, but for some reason I avoided reading this book for years. I wanted nothing to do with it, which is a strange reaction to something fairly benign and something that I honestly didn't know much about. Frankly it's quite bizzare for me to act that way because I've always been a very open reader. So the years went by and then one day... about two weeks ago, this book quite literally fell into my lap. I was at a friends' house, sitting cross legged on her bed, when outta nowhere she tosses this book into my lap and says...\\"READ THIS! It will change you\\"  At first I didn't even know what she had thrown at me, but when I looked down and saw the title, well let's just say...there was an audible...GULP.<br />I couldn't run anymore....<br /><br />So ...reluctantly... I started reading it the next day.<br /><br />I am SO glad I did. I think that the universe(GOD) really does bring you what you need, WHEN you need it, and not before. I don't think I was ready to read this book a few years ago. I think that's why I ran from it. I wouldn't have GOTTEN it, the way I do now. At this point in my life (coincidently, I just turned 31) I related to Liz so much that I started getting a little paranoid.  The details of our lives aren't the same. I've never been married and gone through a divorce, but I have had my share of desperate, crushing, romances. I'm not yet a successful business woman with a fairly stable income,(one day, god willing) but as far as the way she thinks, and the things she felt, BINGO! Hello ME, nice to meet you!<br /><br />Now regardless of what some other reviewers have said, I think there are certain universal truths to things in life. Anyone that says that he or she has not thought certain things at one point in their life, or done things that they may not be proud of, or felt ways that may be irrational, selfish, defeatest,or just plain stupid, well I say...

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Im gonna try to keep this short and sweet. I watch lot's of movies and I read a lot of amazon reviews but this is my very first movie review. I just couldnt help myself. Wall-E has Moved me to write a review,this movie was just that good.    When I rented this movie from Blockbuster it was only because the Blockbuster guy recommended it because I needed a sixth movie to get for free. I didnt know what to expect. I hadnt heard much about it though I am a science nerd and I especially like space science so I figured what the heck.      Wall-E is the perfect movie. It has what many movies nowadays seem to lack... MEANING. It was funny, heartfelt, well-developed, thoughtfull, and entertaining. The lack of dialouge, I feel does not take away from the movie at all. I dont know how many movies Ive wathced lately where the generic, stereo-typical and obnoxious dialouge totally kill half-ass decent movies. So if anything the mininal but clever script of Wall-E is a long awaited breathe of fresh non-polluted air. What this movie may lack in words it more than makes up for in its message, which Im not going to get into cause theres no way you can miss it after watching this movie. Wall-E is also as we've come to expect from Pixar visually stunning and though at time a bit dark and gloomy its still very engaging.    I totally agree with the many reviews that have declared Wall-E a MASTERPIECE. Moving, a great story and a strong message to back it up Wall-E is a precious gem and I strongly recommend it to anyone who just needs a breathe of fresh air.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Star Wars was great. The Empire Strikes back was great. Return of the Jedi was great. The new Blu Ray release doesn't include the original films - only the versions that have been cartoonized. Don't buy it.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Originally bought the version narrated by Oprah, video is almost identical, but the Attenborough is far better.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|Excellent work, as always. This series is more a review of his major productions (Life of Mammals, Blue Planet, etc.) than an entirely new concept, but there is new footage and very little that simply repeats previous videos. I give it a strong four stars - but only because I have very high expectations for Sir David's work. Anyone else would've gotten five stars.
1597801585|3.0|The beginning of the book is hard to get into.  The author spends a lot of time talking about the world, but doesn't end up giving that much detail.  The characters are not fully developed.  Once the action starts, it is a very good story.  The genetic engineering and political background make the book for me.

1596912863|2.0|Unfortuantely this review is going to be short and sweet as I couldn't bring myself to finish reading the book; if I didn't have other books to read I am sure I could have made myself finish it but I kept pushing it down to the bottom of my TBR list.<br /><br />I originally picked up this book because I adore Jane Austen and in the past have found Jane Austen fiction quite enjoyable.  However, I couldn't get engrossed in this book.  I did in fact find Jane Hayes a believable character.  However, the make-believe world that she finds herself in what so make-believe, even for me.  I couldn't get past this fact.  I have read quite a few reviews on this book that rated it rather high, so maybe sometime in the future I will be able to give another chance.
B00014NE62|5.0|\\"Maurice\\" is probably the finest gay-theme dramatic film made to date, with \\"Mysterious Skin,\\" a close second.  The DVD release by Merchant-Ivory does full justice to a very beautiful looking and sounding film.  Similar to other of Forster's works, it deals with the intersection of the social classes of England of the late 19th Century (Fin de Siecle).   I would not, at all, classify this as a \\"gay\\" film but as a superbly crafted drama dealing with a young man's attempting to deal with the anxiety and pressures caused by his emerging sexual feelings which he does not as yet understand.   The film successfully conveys the idea that sexual orientation is not something that a person chooses.  As has often been said: you don't choose it -- it chooses you.  In a scene in which Maurice Hall expresses his concerns to an American (curiously enough) psychoanalyst, he is advised that he might want to consider taking up residence in another European country in which homosexual behavior is not regarded as illegal.  As he says to Maurice: \\"England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.\\"  In spite its central subject matter, this is a film that can be appreciated by all audiences.      It intelligently, movingly and, sometimes, quite provocatively follows the relationships that develop between the Aristocratic Clive Durham (whose family fortune may be running a bit thin), the Middle-Class and less sophisticated and worldly Maurice Hall and the working or serving class Alec Scudder.  All three characters are superbly portrayed by the male leads  and the remainder of the cast are excellent and totally believable.  As is usually the case with Merchant-Ivory films, \\"Maurice\\" looks as if it cost five times as much to produce as it actually did.  The beautiful music  score of Richard Robbins is at times lushly romantic and at other times conveys a disturbing undercurrent perfectly in keeping with the mood of the scene and the recording quality of it is all anyone could ask.    I won't spoil things by discussing the conclusion except to say that, for me, the very final brief shot says a great deal and can draw a tear.  It is sobering to consider that, within a short time after the conclusion of the story,  these three young men would probably be caught up and perhaps killed in the First World War.     This  magnificently photographed and recorded film deserves to be issued in Blu-ray.
0307454541|5.0|This book really delivers--an intricate mystery, a complex yet plausible, internally-consistent, plot, well developed, believable characters, and serviceable writing.  While this book is not an \\"important book\\"--it won't change your life or open you to new avenues of thought--it is a thoroughly engaging page turner, that had my full attention for the week it took to read it (or should I say \\"devour it\\").  Its definitely at the top of its genre, and is a great summer read.  I look forward to reading the sequel (which I already have).
B0034G4OU4|5.0|The movie is based on the best seller (really, it was a phenomenon). And the critics seem to be enjoying taking Elizabeth Gilbert (the person) to task over how she saved herself.  That's fine. That's normal. But it's not quite fair to the movie - which is very good.    At it's core this is a story about having a broken heart and breaking someone's heart. I could relate. Who can't?    Julia Roberts gives one of the strongest performances of her career in this film. I hope she's nominated for an Academy Award (and Richard Jenkins and the cinematography are also award calibre).    I loved this movie. I loved the use of Neil Young - especially \\"Harvest Moon.\\"

0143118420|2.0|Imagine you've been invited to attend a holy gathering where distinguished patrons have come to honor both the Pope and the Dalai Lama.  You dress in smart but modest attire, cover your head out of respect and eat a sparse meal so that you will be attuned to the solemnity of the evening.  After you find your seat, a quiet hush settles on the audience. Then the emcee arrives and walks to the podium.  She's a thirty-something leggy blond, wearing a gold sequined prom dress, who jingles when she walks. She lifts one arm to wave and you get the feeling you've seen her before, maybe in a Miss America pageant or a magazine ad for mouthwash.  She's wearing an inflated grin and a neat little sign around her neck that says, \\"I'm seeking communion with God, No Really, I am!\\"     Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love was marketed as a travelogue of soul-searching and a \\"sincere spiritual investigation.\\"  It turned out to be one woman's excuse for a yearlong escapade to three exotic countries while neatly securing a juicy book contract. My first clue that Gilbert wasn't up to the ascetic rigors of self-discovery was in the introduction, when she says, \\"What happened was that I started to pray.  You know--like, to God.\\" Like?  Like, what is the reader supposed to think after this inane statement?   After going through a protracted divorce and then a separation from a rebound lover boy, poor Elizabeth decides to get away from the men in her life by first going to Italy on the pretense of learning Italian.  I began to get a little suspicious when the first sentence of chapter one starts out: \\"I wish Giovanni would kiss me.\\"  So much for a broken heart.   Gilbert's story is structured along a linear narrative in three parts, as the title suggests: She eats gelato in Rome, she prays in an ashram in India and she loves Ketut, her Balinese guru along with Felipe, a handsome Brazilian, in Indonesia. She does have a facility with the language, leaning toward a witty conversational style.At any given moment, the reader knows where Gilbert is, what she's wearing, who's the object of her latest crush, or what her latest project entails.  I give her credit for clarity and uncluttered prose.   There are a few key moments when Gilbert approaches her spiritual intent.  In chapter 67 she explains that she's never satisfied when great men of God can only describe their enlightenment as \\"indescribable.\\" So, she is generous to try to put words to her own transformation: \\"Simply put, I got pulled through the worm-hole of the Absolute, and in that rush I suddenly understood the workings of the universe completely. I left my body, I left the room, I left the planet. [...] The void was conscious and it was intelligent. The void was God, which means I was inside God.\\"  This is the payoff, the author's spiritual denouement.  But then she cheapens the moment by adding: \\"Not in a gross, physical way--not like I was Liz Gilbert stuck inside a chunk of God's thigh muscle.\\"  Here's where she needs to learn that less is more.   Eat, Pray, Love fails on two major points. It fails as a travel narrative because we learn little, if nothing, about the places Gilbert visits. Can you imagine going to Rome and never setting foot in a museum or cathedral? It also fails as a serious search for the soul because her priorities are never clear (I should have picked this up from the subtitle--a \\"search for everything\\").  One moment she's dying to kiss a suave Italian and the next, she's swooning before an ancient medicine man.  The reader is, like, confused.  Gilbert is a young, privileged self-absorbed woman trying to get her audience to take her seriously--but not too seriously.

B002ZG99G8|5.0|So overall 'The Losers' may be a lower budget version of the 'A Team,' but it's still a pretty good movie that's worth watching. It may not be for everyone though, because it's mostly an action flick but it's pretty good to watch.<br /><br />Basically a military unit is set up by a mysterious man from the CIA, while everyone thinks they are dead their actually trying to prove themselves innocent while hiding out. When a mysterious women comes along an offers to help the men get their reputation back they have to decide if they can trust her. An whole trying to deal with their known enemies, they also have to deal with those lurking in the shadows.<br /><br />ash

9889979942|5.0|A complex microcosm of the world is captured in the faces of those who comprise a quarter of Earth's population, depicted in this kaleidoscopic composure of life. Perhaps Shanghai Province is the most diverse. Smiles and sad faces greet readers, mimicked by stressful expressions on those of \\"China's Wall Street\\" investors. Carter has concocted a Rubik's Cube-view of China.<br /><br />The Magic City of Hong Kong features \\"the best of Beijing and Bangkok, London and Las Vegas, New York and New Delhi. [T]here truly is nowhere else in the world like Hong Kong...China's wealthiest city.\\" Originally a Portuguese colony, neighboring Macau has taken on the flavor of Las Vegas, where mega-hotelier Steve Wynn influenced Vegas-style over-the-top gaming resorts in China. The \\"Chinese have turned Macau into their own Sino-Sin City.\\"<br /><br />Carter chooses to depict China's peoples as they are: the hopeful, the deformed, the sad, those who toil in coal mines and \\"pink-light\\" districts. And the coldness of steel reflected in the faces of military personnel. This is a study of China, portrayed by the artistic eye of the photojournalist. As lyrics from Daniel Powter's song, Bad Day, would have us believe, \\"the camera don't lie.\\" The soul of China is captured by Carter's camera and journalistic text. Perhaps the overwhelming charm of the camera to make people smile unites more than political open-door policies could ever fathom.<br /><br />Carter's camera captures Xanadu, \\"the summer palace of Kublai Khan.\\" A \\"rowdy drinker\\" in Chaoyang, Beijing Province, laughingly offers American-born Carter, who now lives in Beijing, the American single-finger salute. In shadows of gleaming glass-and-steel towers, ancient tiled pagoda-temple roofs crumble from neglect.<br /><br />This is a somewhat voyeuristic view of the peoples who are the soul of China. The 33 chapters coincide with China's equal number of provinces. Most notable is the ever-present smile a camera generates. Contrasts abound: A street cleaner who earns $800 a year is featured daydreaming in front of a luxury-car dealership.<br /><br />Poetry introduces each chapter/province, and not only the pictorial kind. From Chapter Ten, Zhejiang Province, poetic prose lures the wanderlust:<br /><br />  Lady Zhejiang here we must part,<br />  For the next province awaits my embrace,<br />  Sad wanderer once you conquer the East,<br />  Where do you go?<br /><br />Imagine capturing the spirit of fifty states in six hundred pages.

Of all books read this was the best one for using facts and scriptures    A very unique book that is more so a study of the Islam.    The author takes scripture from Quran and Bible then shows the differences  and relates them to news events, attacks etc..it is more like a Bio or Report but yet very interesting because so much is in current events or history that we know
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Thought I'd take a moment to share my experience of this re-packaged DVD entitled \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" directed by F.F. Coppola. First of all, if you've been sitting on a fence about getting a DVD copy of this film, this is the ONE to buy!<br /> I remember passing this up in the theater and watching about the first 30 minutes on TBS and thinking \\"Glad I didn't pay money to see that . . .\\" Now I've been slowly building a collection of DVD's seeings how vhs tape has been declared obsolete and just started getting some classic horror flicks together like Frankenstein, Wolfie, and the gang but one of my big deals is that I'll usually skip a DVD if it does not include Special Features like how they made the movie and this is the first standard DVD of this flick that includes that and MUCH more.<br /> Not sure if these features were pre-existing or put together for this release, but they clearly explain how these types of old monster movies were originally constructed and specifically this one. Once I watched those and then the movie(or visa versa)I had a totally new found respect for this film(in widescreen of course)!<br /> The transfer is flawless and a real treat. The movie is just over 2hrs 07min but goes much quicker without the commercials and bad editing! It may be a tad pricey for a '92 film but, if you really love classic horror movies AND how they made 'em, this is actually worth the money! I'll be watching this every Halloween along with repackaged versions of Frankie and the Wolfman from now on, thank you.
B003OJBWGK|5.0|After releasing a handful of excellent EP's in 2009, Bethany Cosentino and Benn Bruno, aka as Best Coast, continue in the dream pop vein that they began, only their debut LP is more ambitious and entirely more focused.  The melodies are stronger, the instruments less distorted, the voices clearer. and the lyrics are much stronger.  Basically Best Coast have stepped up their game tenfold.  Track for track, Crazy For You is one of my favorite albums released this year along with Arcade Fire's 'The Suburbs' and a Ty Segall's 'Melted.'  When I was at university some 5 to 8 years ago I had come to the conclusion that all new music sucked with the exception of Radiohead, Wilco, Elliott Smith, The White Stripes, and The Shins.  Now, after the 2000s have come to a close and we are past the halfway point of 2010 I can look back over the past decade (plus this year) and safely say that it has been the best 10 years of music since 1963-1972.  And that is a BOLD statement considering that those years are viewed by all who know anything about modern music and it's history, as the golden era of melody and song-craft.  I was correct in my theory that all modern rock and pop music sucked and sucked hard.  However, that being true, what I was forgetting about was all the great music that came out on the independent labels!!  It began as far back as the mid to late 1990s with Belle and Sebastian and Cat Power from the now iconic Matador label, etc.  Hell, you could argue as far back as I.R.S. with R.E.M. or 4AD with The Pixies.  And now with bands like Best Coast via their Mexican Summer label leading the way along with Beach House, Fleet Foxes and many others, music is again an art form and albums a work of art.  And with all this being said, one of the the keys to finding EXTRA-ordinary new music like Best Coast is VINYL! Yes Vinyl, that wonderful 12\\" black circle of wonderment.  If a new band releases their new albums on vinyl, chances are, they are a decent band, and in many cases such as Best Coast, a great band.

B002ZG980U|3.0|Now the movie was hailed as a masterpiece BEFORE hardly anybody saw it including most film critics. Is it? Time will tell but I doubt it. Except for some ingenious editing, the movie ain't all that. Inception seems vastly over-hyped and will diminish in stature over the years after the Hollywood propaganda mill and glowing blurbs and buzz promoting ads have faded away. And after YOUR first impression.<br />On this euphoric reception David Edelstein says, \\"It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and--hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype--a metaphor for itself\\". Anyway, great controversy erupted over dissenting reviews, especially Edelstein's.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this movie is the conversation it spawned, or rather the subject it's reception generated interesting commentaries on.<br />Recommended reading: The brilliant Jim Emerson's blog Scanners and his multiple entries on Inception, especially \\"On Liking and Not Liking\\". Emerson focuses on actual arguments.<br />ALSO: \\"Seventeen Ways of Criticizing 'Inception'\\" right here-->[...]<br /><br />Upon first viewing I enjoyed the visuals but realized I'm (as with many people) less phased by new special effects than I used to be. I recall years ago being in awe of cutting edge effects. No longer. I'm simply expecting incredible effects to be a standard for any decent fantasy/sci-fi flick.<br />I enjoyed the cast and some action sequences were fantastic.<br />I found the logic(?)highly dubious if not incomprehensible, even tho _most of the movie consists of characters supposedly explaining the movie_.<br />I feel the dream worlds are way too literal. WHY are these dream worlds \\"constructed\\" the way they are again? Why do....NEVER MIND. Asking why will lead to an infinite regression of whys and no doubt the internet will contain years of analysis explaining Inception.<br />The plot really is absurd--not that absurd is always necessarily 'bad'. But I'll just say I am not fascinated by the epistemological puzzle. It seems we as viewers of the film are supposed to be and to the extent we are then--personally for ME anyway--Inception is a failure. Is he dreaming still? Who's dream is it? (etc.) I don't really care.t absurd is always necessarily 'bad'. But I'll just say I am not fascinated by the epistemological puzzle.

B000E33VWW|5.0|A couple things from late 1959 seem to stick in my mind. One was the brutal murder of an entire family in western Kansas. That one created real shock waves in that we lived in Boulder, Colorado. which was only a couple hundred miles away and the killers remained free for a while. A second thing was that I had enrolled in graduate school far away in Seattle. I knew no one, had no friends and nothing to do other than school work. It was one of those periods in my life when I lost myself in reading. One of my favored authors was Truman Capote and I read a couple of his books. \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" come to mind. I remember being startled when I learned of Capote going to Kansas to research the situation in order to white a book about the grisly crime and the convicted killers. It seemed totally out of character and I couldn't imagine what type of book would come out of this situation. Well, the resulting book was the very highly acclaimed \\"In Cold Blood\\" and Capote was informally crowned America's greatest living author.<br /><br />I never got around to reading \\"In Cold Blood\\" as I was then deeply into my latter days of graduate school and the early years of my career as a professor. Likewise, when the movie \\"Capote\\" came out, I just wasn't into going to movies. Lately, my wife and I have been watching movies late at night on DVDs. So, I was scratching through the ultra-bargain DVD shelf in a Ross store and there was the \\"Capote\\" DVD and I snapped it up immediately. Strangely, my wife refused to watch it in that she didn't like the idea of a family getting murdered. I tried to explain, but it was no use. I watched it last night while she was at a baby shower. The movie was simply outstanding!<br /><br />Several things stand out about the movie \\"Capote.\\" One was the directing and the magnificent capturing of the stark beauty of western Kansas and the depiction of the people. Outstanding! Secondly, I've seen Truman Capote on talk shows many times and, of course, he's a completely unique and easily recognized personality. Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman did an absolutely stunning job of portraying Capote in the movie. There were times when he was so close in looks and voice, that I'd almost swear that it actually was Capote. Surely, this was acting at it's finest!<br /><br />The story of \\"Capote\\" unfolded in a somewhat grim documentary style, but it fit the situation perfectly and I felt no lapse of attention at any point in the movie. All acting was excellent! The story was completely believable and made for compelling viewing. The movie left me with deep emotional feelings, even for the hapless killers. The movie is a stunning portrait of of a tragic event and it's aftermath.<br /><br />Gary Petersonof course, he's a completely unique and easily recognized personality.

B000VBP382|5.0|This movie is extraordinary, and is highly deserving of love and praise! It instantly became my favourite movie, and I've watched it more times than I can count!! The special features in this Collector's edition are fantastic. I love Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet; I think she did a splendid job capturing Elizabeth's spirit and wit. Matthew Macfadyen totally became Mr. Darcy. *fangirl moment* The rest of the cast is equally amazing :)    You'll be blown away by the beauty of the English countryside, the grandeur of the estates, and the loveliness of the filmscore/background music <3

B0030Y10ZM|5.0|I didn't know about the Original Album Series (\\"OAS\\") until today. While visiting the Rock Hall of Fame in Cleveland I stumbled across a few Original Album Series releases in their gift shop. I already had some Donny Hathaway on compilations but didn't own any of his albums. I immediately scooped up this release and I absolutely love it. I'd love to see some more Original Album Series and hope they eventually gain US release as it's a great bargain. Kind of a strange release though... most folks who would want to own five albums from an artist rather than a simpler compilation or Greatest Hits would probably already own most of the albums included in the box set OAS format.  As there's no new additions or previously unreleased tracks this probably won't appeal to people who already own these discs. For example, there were a few artists who also had OAS but I already owned two or three of the albums included and couldn't justify purchasing it for other parts of the discography that I might consider sub-par. Oh well, if you like Donny Hathaway then I'd highly recommend this release... nothing sub-par here! Also, the Otis Redding OAS is amazing!

It has great metal songs on it and still stands as a great example of what metal should be melodic and well written and sung.  Although this one is the most thudding of all sabbaths discs to be sure. Supernaut sounds like jet engines pumping sound out of their tails to me. That massive thud would lead to other types of metal later too.  I don't think there is a bad song on this one and this remaster has the better sound of any release out there.
B002ZG9788|1.0|A very poorly made action movie.Utter Nonsense. Everything, from acting to story to action sucks.
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|A remix has the potential to completely reinvent a song. Prince added additional lyrics and bold musical detours for his Purple Rain through Sign O' The Times singles. Kate Bush added lyrics, guest voices and new arrangements to her Hounds of Love 12\\" vinyl singles. Victor Calderone created an absolutely stunning 10-minute re-imagining Madonna's Beautiful Stranger; Steve Lillywhite had the genius to boldly dismantle, reconstruct and expand Big Country's early singles using only the originally-recorded musical components. Duran Duran added dark edge to their singles, releasing them as Night Versions.<br /><br />And then there's Lady Gaga's The Remix. Like most remix albums these days, the guest DJs add generic, pre-programmed beats and sand all the edges off the original production. Where Gaga's originals have meat and spice, these are boiled a bit bland for my taste. That said, if you need a good workout mix, this is ready to go.<br /><br />If nothing else, this helps stave off the hunger for Gaga's next album in 2011. There's not a mix in the bunch I would click past when it comes up on my Shuffle.<br /><br />And if you're on the fence about CD or download, don't opt for the CD just for the artwork. All you get is the pretty cover and a single inlay of production credits on the inside. White type on gray background. No lyrics. No additional photos. No liner notes. One would think that Gaga might not even know about this release's existence.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|This was a great summer read.  I can't wait to read more by David Nicholls.
B0000032LS|4.0|I love this soundtrack so much. I put off hunting down a copy of the soundtrack for years; but now I finally have a copy. I was disappointed to about some things missing from this soundtrack.     There were two songs which were deleted from the picture show, \\"Once in a while\\" sang by Barry Bostwick, and \\"Superheroes\\" sang by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon. \\"Superheroes\\" is featured on this version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack but \\"Once in a While\\" is not. I love the latter so much; I was sad to discover in wasn't on the cd.    I had hoped that a little bit of the dialogue surrounding the songs would be included but it is not. Other versions of this soundtrack do include this.    The soundtrack is great; just be forewarned about those things.
0736092269|5.0|I needed a specific book for my professional library.  After searching local bookstores for several days with no success,  I was discouraged and tired.  At that moment I had a brain inspiration.  Why go through all of this stress when all I needed to do was go to Amazon.com and log on?  Indeed it was just that simple....for within 3 minutes I had located the book that I needed and for a economical price.  After all of that all I did was wait on it's arrival.  It came in about 4-5 days, safely and in the condition as represented.  A successful transaction made so by Amazon's quick and simple process.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I just wanted to rate this as highly as possible - it is divine. Simply divine. If there was any doubt about Joan Sutherland being the voice of the century, this recording will easily nullify all the debates.<br /><br />It is Sutherland, and Sutherland only.<br /><br />PS: Sutherland's voice is what I would describe as 'golden' in hue and effect. It is a marvel to witness how cold that gold sounds here, as the Ice Princess Turandot. It is a block of luminous gold; solid, thick and reflective. It is trained impeccably well: agile, un-apologetically feminine and poised. It is not liquid, but still malleable. A voice with no upper limit, yet brooding with a cold fire beneath it all. Sutherland sounds like an angel as Lucia and Lakme. The sensual warmth of her voice, which can be found in her Violetta or Semiramide, is nowhere to be found here. This is her Esclarmonde/Norma voice: cold as the blue ocean.<br /><br />People will say she was not an actress. Well, she was not. She was a musician, and if you can manage to evoke this much emotion with your voice alone, then who really cares about prancing around in silly costumes or so-called flawless diction? This is way up there as a crown jewel of opera for me, very much like Callas's incomparable Tosca.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the definitive version of P&P, in my view. The casting and faithfulness to the novel are far superior to any other version. Elizabeth Garvie in particular is perfect in the role of Lizzie Bennett.
B002VECMAE|4.0|Starz cable channel lists this as a \\"dark comedy\\" but I don't think I laughed even once during the film. Maybe dark comedy isn't my thing. None the less, despite not being funny the movie was quite entertaining and had a lot of interesting tidbits about Government activities in the 70's & 80's which included funding & researching the possible military application of psychic abilities like \\"remote viewing.\\" For more information on this you can Google Project Jedi or Project Stargate.<br /><br />The film did go a little cheesy at the end, and if you are looking for a good laugh, you would probably be disappointed with this one, but there were many interesting avenues in the film if you are into psychic abilities and Government conspiracies, this one will entertain. By the way, nice element having Ewan McGregor play the one that is learning the way of the Jedi!<br /><br />Final Grade: B
B003PBB4ME|5.0|My son was looking for a stabilizing handle for his video camera.  This was the perfect price and an awesome purchase.  Very easy to use and store.

B000UOOT1W|1.0|This has got to be the worst compilation of Santana's milestone of work. Clearly it was Arista Records attempt to capitolize on Carlos Santana's success during the 90's. After I saw the song list I passed on buying it. One day someone with knowledge will put together a first rate compilation of his \\"Hits\\" and his hidden treasure's. I can do it if they would contact me. I've been a fan since growing up with Santana in the 60's in the San Francisco Bay Area. Peace.
B003HTPHSQ|1.0|I am a huge blues fan and own 100's of great blues cds. I have never heard something so bad in my life. Cyndi's screeching voice does not fit in with B.B.King or Johhny Lang at all. She's coming to town in a few weeks and I will make sure I'm doing something else more enjoyable like having a root canal. Really,really bad!!!
030745455X|5.0|I actually bought The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo first (digitally), The Girl who Kicked The Hornet's Nest second, before The Girl who Played With Fire-I was racing through a book store in Ireland and picked it off a display stack, not pausing to actually read the title. I quickly ordered \\"Fire\\" next when I got home. All three books could have been read as a single mystery, with no problem from being \\"out of order.\\" I totally enjoyed the trilogy, despite Swedish place names and character names (you get used to them after a while). Rumors of a fourth book will keep my attention on Amazon etc. I hope they're true!
B002T9H2LK|4.0|Everyone knows Tarantino (its fair to assume). His well-known, well-bought, well-cited works are typically \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and Pulp Fiction\\". Fair enough, though I feel they tend to lose their appeal on repeated viewings. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a different animal altogether---within his work, its the other side of the planet. Its a period piece...its a multi-international dialogue/cast...and, most importantly, the  dialogue is all pertinent to the story being told---it works wonders. I felt (as I know others did) that with \\"Death Proof\\", he chewed up valuable time with mostly unnecessary dialogue. With \\"I.B.\\", he hits the highest mark he's ever hit, bless 'im.  Repeated viewings take away nothing with this one---you notice more, as a good film will bring that depth. Great acting, great lines, great cinematography (his best yet, I dare say) great violence, humor all set around one of the most sad and vile times in human history. Not easy to pull off. And still not for everybody---but what is?  SO---if you are going to purchase this DVD (as a virgin viewer OR as one who has seen it many times), the 2-disc set (especially at Amazon's prices) is a better deal than the 1-disc version. Although I would've hoped for more, the additional scenes, interviews (especially the roundtable interview) are insightful and enjoyable to watch. So go with the 2-disc, if you care about such things...
0743201140|1.0|The book is great but buying it from Amazon was not.  There is a code inside the spine of the dust jacket. I bought the book as \\"new\\" but there was no code in the back to take the online test at the end of the book. I returned the book and got a refund but if I didn't know about the code I would have read 1/2 the book before learing about the code and I don't know how Amazon would have handled a returned 1/2 read book.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|Undeniably, great special effects. Unfortunately not sufficient to make a good movie. The story line is poor, linear, and barely compares to the Star Trek universe. This version is more like space cowboys. I am a The Next Generation fan. In TNG, Captain Picard is constantly faced with situations that require a discerning and strategic approach, combining smarts, negotiation, creativity, tactical maneuvers, not just the boring \\"let's blow them up with a bunch of proton torpidos\\". Zachari Quinto (Spock) is the only excellent actor in this mascarade.
B001LF347E|5.0|I'm glad I found this.  Merlin is a great show & I'm glad to see a 3rd season.  Keep the DVD's coming!
0307389839|4.0|This is a book dedicated to every runner in the world. Running is an act that defies logic, leisure and modern habits. It is comforting to see how Murakami allows us runners, to understand better why we run, why we love to run and why we will keep on running until our legs and minds allow us. If you love running you will love this book.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Minor spoilers if you haven't read book 1.<br /><br />Oh man! This series is the bomb-diggity! The goodness that is Cat and Bones just keeps on coming.<br /><br />One Foot in the Grave starts off with it being 4 years later. Cat left Bones (dumbass!) and moved her and her mom to Virginia. She was approached with an offer that she felt like she couldn't refuse. Cat is now working for the FBI. She hunts vampires as a professional. She has her own team and she can kick ass and take names without worrying about covering her tracks with the law. I understand her motives behind leaving Bones behind but it doesn't mean I have to like it! This was one of the few times that I wished that the story was told in 3rd POV because I desperately wanted to know what Bones was feeling and thinking when he discovered that Cat had left him. Luckily we didn't have to suffer too long before the two were reunited.<br /><br />Cat and Bones are back to working together. Cat is now being hunted. There's a price on the Red Reaper's head and there are vamps out there that are eager to collect. We learn more about Bones's past and about vampire politics.<br /><br />Cat and Bones experience a few bumps in the road regarding their relationship; Cat's disapproving mom - I was hoping someone would kill her ass, Cat's disapproving team and a woman from Bones' past. And don't forget about the vamps that are out to kill her. How is she supposed to work on her relationship with a price tag hanging over head? But they manage to hold it together despite all the crap being tossed their way. That is what makes them a great and powerful couple. They are strong on their own; but together they are indestructible (or as close to indestructible as you can get).<br /><br />One Foot in the Grave has the infamous Chapter 32. Everyone kept telling me, \\"wait until you read chapter 32.\\" Or asking me, \\"have you read Chapter 32 yet?\\" I was tempted to take a peek at Chapter 32 to find out what the fuss was all about because the suspense was killing me! But I didn't. I exercised restraint. I've never read so fast in my life! And I stayed up late so that I could go to bed knowing what was so special about Chapter 32. That chapter was so worth staying up late and oversleeping the next day! Holy crap! Talk about HOT! An entire chapter dedicated to - no I'm not going to say. You're just going to have to find out for yourselves! Small hint - Chapter 32 is just as good as Chapter 4 in Dreamfever.ut I didn't. I exercised restraint. I've never read so fast in my life!

B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I know this hasn't come out yet (I'm sure it will be as bittersweet as any other end of a series DVD), but I just wanted to prelude its release with a plea to other fans of this show.  Maybe if we buy the DVD's right away it will show CBS that they made a HUGE mistake.  If sales were through the roof maybe they would realize their mistake and try to pick it up again.  This happened when they cancelled Angel, only everyone involved had moved on to permanent jobs already (Bones, Supernatural).  Jennifer Love is just doing small movies and guest spots right now, the writers are developing new projects, but maybe it's not too late.  This just sucks.  Why are network people so stupid?  If you go buy the numbers and not by the fan output and desire you are not really seeing the true popularity of a show.  How many people have a Nielsen box anymore?  This crap that they pull is the reason why I watch the shows on DVD instead of TV.  But I'm Canadian so it's not like my ratings count anyway.       Shuffling the time slots every few months, changing days to see if it will go up against another network's most popular show, showing re-runs for 3 or 4 weeks every few new episodes....  Just stand behind your show and leave it alone and you'd really see how popular it is you business school morons.  I don't think we'll ever see a network hold onto a show for 10 years again... gone are the days when a show like Friends or Seinfeld can fluctuate in ratings but still stay until THEY want to leave.  I miss the days when TV didn't disappoint me on a daily basis.  We're really not all as stupid as you think we are Hollywood, we're getting tired of your crappy movies, re-makes of EVERYTHING that has ever made money in the past and your cheap reality TV shows. Just tell me Medium isn't next!            Rant over.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|Someone took utmost care in selecting these songs. Buy this anthology and obtain an awesome sample of the most melodic, exhilarating, and technically expert music ever performed. It's a good way to get all of the Police's greatest hits without buying all of their individual releases. You still end up with a fabulous collection of fantastic music that blows you away. And if you're interested in the truth (not rumors) about the human beings behind this soulful music, Stewart Copeland's home movie \\"Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out\\" reveals the lives, relationships, and emotions that inspired their accomplishments.
0143118420|3.0|I think I was most disappointed because I was a little misread. The book is not about a woman taking adventures around the world as much as it is a woman avoiding manic depression and suicidal tendencies.<br /><br />She's the neediest woman I've ever heard of and it's unlikely this trip was anything but that: a trip. She'll need medication most of her life, which is very sad but very necessary.<br /><br />I think the Merde series or Brazilian travelogues are superior in their sort of inspirational and magical descriptions of places far away. Even the Thai Detective novels were more enjoyable.<br /><br />In summary, travelling the world with a needy manic depressive is a bit of a drag.<br /><br />Three Stars.

B00003CX8Y|1.0|I have seen quite a few Disney movies \\"remastered\\" over a period of time that are just as old, if not older than this one. This one is hands down the worst quality I have ever seen for a Disney movie converted to DVD. My recommendation.. Don't waste your money if you want to enjoy the movie and go else where for this classic.
0140157352|4.0|I got this book as part of a negotiation class I took in 2003 but never got around to reading it until now.  The book reinforced many of the concepts I learned in the 2003 class.  What really stood out was this book is a product of the Harvard Negotiation Project at Harvard Law School, written in 1981 and reissued in 1991.  Many of the concepts in the book talk about disagreeing without being disagreeable, separating the people from the problem, and seeking mutual interest out of mutual respect.  These are all things Barack Obama talked about on his campaign and after being elected president.  It got me thinking if there is a connection since he graduated from Harvard Law in 1991.  I'm guessing that these concepts were probably fresh in the minds of the professors there since the book was in the process of being reissued around the same time.  If I'm right, it's a strong case for remembering whatever you learn in school because you never know how many years later you're going to need it!
1932907009|2.0|I'm a professional screenwriter, and here's a typical comment I get at parties: \\"Oh you're a writer?  I have this great idea for a movie.  All I need is someone to write the dialogue...I'll give you my idea and you write the dialogue and we'll split the money.\\"  These sadly misguided people are actually serious about this proposal.  These people are the kind for whom \\"Save The Cat\\" is meant.<br /><br />In other words, people who think so little of the art of screenwriting that it's just \\"an idea and some dialogue\\" to them.  Ideas are cheap and plentiful, it's the execution of the idea that matters.  \\"Save the Cat!\\" offers no insight into the art of screenwriting, but it is a concise guide to how to write a crappy script.  The fact is: the author sold several hack scripts and made money on them.  The implied reasoning is \\"I made money on crappy scripts, so you can, too!\\"  There is no disputing that crappy scripts sell and get made all the time, but you can't build a career on them.  And why would you want to?  Clearly the author couldn't, either, hence this book and all the other products based on it.<br /><br />If you haven't looked at his credits, he wrote \\"Blank Check\\" and \\"Stop or My Mom Will Shoot.\\"  These movies got 4.2 and 3.4 stars on IMDB.  Of course, the writer is not responsible for the final product, but from the way he talks in the book, I'm sure these screenplays were only improved in the production process.<br /><br />BTW, he had 3 co-writers on those movies, so we don't even know what his contribution to each of them was.<br /><br />If you are a good writer with actual talent and something to say, you'll benefit from Robert Mckee's \\"Story.\\"  If your aim is much lower, then buy \\"Save the Cat.\\"  The concepts are simple and will propel you well on your way to hack-dom.  If you want to write the next \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" this book ain't for you.  But if you want to write the next Paris Hilton direct-to-DVD movie, the next woman-in-peril Lifetime Movie Channel schlock, or the next Tyler Perry movie, then \\"Save the Cat\\" is for you. (BTW, \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" has no \\"save the cat\\" moment in it.  Shakespeare does not do anything to help anyone (or any cat) in the film.  \\"Groundhog Day\\" has no such moment either -- which is kind of the point of the whole movie.  Get the idea?  If you want to be original, this ain't your book.)<br /><br />I fully realize my review may sound snobby, and perhaps it is.  To be fair, the types of movies that Blake Snyder's rigid cookie-cutter formula engender certainly have their place in the business.  They've been made from the beginning of cinema and continue to be made.  And if that's what you're meant to write, then go for it.  Just don't expect this book to elevate your idea to anywhere in the realm of art.<br /><br />It kind of reminds of the one and only class I ever took in filmmaking at UCLA.  The teacher was an Oscar-winning producer.  When he told the class the story of how he got attached as a producer to a film that won an Oscar, it was clear it was all kind of a fluke and that he personally had nothing to do with the artistic merit of the film.  He concluded by saying: \\"My point is that if a no-talent schmuck like me can win an Oscar and make it in this business, there's no reason why you can't either.\\"  I will never forget his brutal honesty.  But obviously, his career did not last since there he was teaching an extension course at UCLA.  But his honest assessment of the business is oddly comforting.<br /><br />The simple truth is that there are tons of people in the business with little or no talent who make a living.  Seriously.  I know -- I've worked with them.  \\"Save the Cat\\" tells you how to be one of those people.  Whether this is a good or bad thing, it's not for me to say.<br /><br />On the flip side, there are tons of people with oodles of talent who *don't* make it in the business because they never actually finish their screenplay.  Or more likely, they finish itbut never do the necessary rewrites.  So if this book gets you to write and rewrite, then it will have served a good purpose.<br /><br />P.S. Other wonderful movies with no \\"Save the Cat\\" moment: Sunset Boulevard, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (I don't count him merely feeding his dog), Muriel's Wedding, Barry Lyndon, Bullets Over Broadway, Being John Malkovich, The Man Who Would Be King, True Grit, The Lady Eve, The Purple Rose of Cairo, The Social Network, and of course the highest-grossing movie of all time: Gone With the Wind.  And these are only the ones I could think of off the top of my head.
B003O85W3A|5.0|While Arcade Fire's previous albums were very good, \\"The Suburbs\\" is consistently great from start to finish. It sounds completely organic: the songs get exactly the right treatment, the hooks are deep (but not immediate or cloying), the sequencing is impeccable, and the instrumentation is layered and nuanced without being dense or overproduced. Overall, the album exceeded all of my expectations, but certainly creates a lofty standard for their next outing. It's so gratifying to see a band with this kind of promise find their voice and continue to push their limits without trying too hard to impress. It's astounding to me that the album debuted at #1 -- perhaps there's hope for the music industry yet. Make no mistake: this is not the sound of a band selling out. It's the sound of confidence and growth.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Absolutely wonderful read - like a good crime novel (but more scientific) it was impossible to put down. After having read 50% I ordered my VFFs and by the end of the book I did my first run in a year, because I also used to have the same question: \\"why does my foot hurt\\". Thanks for making my life healthier and probably longer, Christopher!
0385312083|5.0|I will not write a long or detailed review, I will just say that this is my all-time favorite book.  I think that Kurt Vonnegut is a genius author and this is his best, both in humor and story.  I have read it twice and loved it both times.  I would recommend this as a must-read to anyone.
B001QOGYBI|3.0|It was visually entertaining but nothing more. To me it was just action scene after action scene with no real rhyme or reason .  Look, just because objects move fast on the screen for and hour and a half and gets your adrenaline pumping, doesn't mean it was a great movie. The movie also didn't have a heart to it. It felt emotionally cold. O.k. in a cartoon world we can argue that a fox doesn't show emotion because they are crafty, but there was something seriously lacking in this movie. There wasn't any real substance to it.  I say it's slightly below average.  Tom C.

B000JU7NCE|5.0|Pienso que la idea fué  crear un producto burdo a dos guitarras y una edición pobre con el fin de no parecer viejo y profesional. Lo lograron. Es excelente. Mantiene la escencia del Rock and Roll.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Although my wife and I enjoyed the movie I may have given it a star less except I'm adding another because of the negative book reviewers writing movie reviews. I appreciate the fact they want the movies to be the books, I really do. This is not going to happen. I must admit it took me awhile to move beyond that same desire which blinded me to the good points. It was made into a movie and some of the material is there to expose the public to an interest which will hopefully get them to read the books.<br /><br />We had no preconceptions going into this movie as neither of us had read this set of books. We will now that we have seen the movie. We find it better that way so we don't cast dispersions because of disappointment. We both found the casting, directing, sets, cinamatography, costumes, F/X, music, sound and the rest quite good. This is basicly a modern version of [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans (Keepcase)]]. The story takes place now with a young man in High School living with his mom and stepfather. When Zeus's lightning bolt is stolen he believes Percy, son of Poseidon, stole it.<br /><br />Percy isn't even aware he is a demigod and when he is told it is overwhelming at first as he also has to go on the run to avoid mythical creatures trying to kill him and get the lightning bolt for themselves or their god. Percy (Perseus) goes on an adventure with a satyr and the daughter of Athena. While trying to collect three pearls they encounter the likes of Medussa and a hydra along the way. They try to get Percy's mother out of Hades and return the bolt to Zeus. Overall it smacks of an updated version of the original mythological story of Perseus. If you enjoy mythological movies you will probably enjoy it. Good quality DVD picture and sound with extras listed in the features. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B000YAFJXE The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
0061122092|1.0|Paul Cohelo is no doubt a very good author.  He has been read worldwide by tens of millions.   I read The Alchemist and The Devil and Miss Prym and found them to be very, very good books.  Because of this, I was eager with anticipation to read my third novel by Cohelo but unfortunately was disappointed and found By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept to be pure drudgery to get through.    The previous two novels were elegant in their simplicity and yet captivating stories of human nature and the struggle to listen to and follow one's will, especially in the face of adverse circumstances.  I never felt this struggle nor cared much about what happened to the central characters in this book and thus never really felt pulled into the story.      After reading some of the other Amazon reviews of those who gave the book two stars or less, I too found the story \\"underwhelming\\", the narration and dialogue \\"dry and repetitive\\" and  many details missing behind the history of the two central characters that made the story in its present tense emotionally flat and uninspiring.       Skip this book and read the two aforementioned books by Cohelo.
030745455X|5.0|Very enjoyable continuation of the first novel, taking the main characters further in their development and revealing some secrets about the past. If you're interested in teh movies currently in circulation (the Swedish versions), I found reading the novels first helped understand the plot, even though the movies necessarily (because of time) leave out plot points from the novels. In particular, viewing the second movie before reading the novel, I found places the movie skipped along explained in the novel and, in retrospect, reading the novel helped understand several scenes in the movie. Which makes this sound a bit like a movie review, I suppose; I enjoyed both the movies and books, but truly enjoyed reading the story, adn am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the third novel to continue the story.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Perfect video for the ultimate Rush fan! Very cool old home video of Alex and videos with John Rutsey playing live. Love this band? You will LOVE this video!!!
B001BJ690Y|2.0|Sick of this guy riding on Pulp fiction and Reservoir Dogs for the rest of his life. They were great movies... but this movie is an imitation of Sergio Leone\Ennio Morricone work. There is no vision here... In fact what tarantino has done is work backwards. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns were inspired by Japanese films amongst many things. Here, Tarantino turns a spaghetti Western back into a Samurai tale. There are scene for scene shots from 'Good, Bad and the Ugly' and that makes me angry.     Its an entertaining film but Tarantino is just ripping Sergio a new one... Kill Bill Vol II and Inglorious Basterds aswell.      Then there is the homage to B-grade movies ahem ahem  and the manga derived animation... as if we've been hiding under a rock    Has he devoted his life to resurrecting other people's work.    He gets the big bucks for this? He openly admits he likes someone or something and he rips it off and thats ok now...
1423113381|5.0|I am personally a really big fan of the Percy Jackson series, so when I found out that the author wad writing another book about gods and their children, and that this one would be about Egyptian ones instead of Greek ones, I got really excited. I am also a really big fan of anything Egyptian.     When I got this book, I devoured it that day. It was such a good book and, though some parts were a little iffy, I still fell in love with it. I wont tell you what happens because I don't like ruining things for people, but I will encourage you to buy it, and if you are looking for something for your kid to read, this is the perfect book and has just the right amount of everything to keep you interested for the whole book.
B003K025TQ|5.0|...brilliant artistry, superb sound and diverse chops from some of the best guitarists on earth would be a start.  This compilation takes you to so many different places emotionally.  If you love amazing musicianship, you're going to love this.  If you're a guitar player, you'll be in heaven!!
1416589473|5.0|I picked it up about two days ago and read it in one day. The story is very engaging. The best thing I liked from the book, as a Guild Wars fan, is the lore used in the book. This book basically bridges the two games together. Since the new game will be 250 years after the first one, readers will learn what has happened with the world in those years, what alliances and wars have been forged and what we will see in the upcoming game. Perfect for fans of the game that want the full GW experience and for anyone that wants to know what Guild Wars is all about. Hopefully the events that happen in the book will be included in the game. I cant wait for the second novel. I can even imagine a movie coming out of this.
B0019M06JS|5.0|Her sound and voice flows through so beautifully and touchingly. Hard not to feel uplifted by these wonderfully laced tracks. They take you to places, thoughts, and emotions unlike no other. Truly a gifted artist that knows her craft. One of my most prized musical discoveries. Buy it. You won't be dissapointed.
B002ZG9846|5.0|its got everything you would want in a movie, its hilarious, well written, beautifully shot, has amazing action and they dont really hold back on anything. Sure its got an 11 year old girl with a bad mouth and a gun but c'mon thats COOL, and she did a seriously great job playing the character. I see some people whining that its not identical to the novel, but get over it geeks! I wouldnt change the movie whatsoever. If you dont like this movie then there must be something wrong with you.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I liked the movie very much because it was filmed on location in UP of Michigan.
4789011623|5.0|I have used the \\"Adventures in Japanese\\" series books before, but I realized when I received this product that I like the \\"Genki\\" series better.  The illustrations are enjoyable and the way the book is divided is logical.  I'd highly recommend this product (with the workbook and audio CD) to anyone who wants to learn Japanese.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|Avoid all of these Journey remasters/ reissues and find the original non-remastered CD's. Why? Please see below the next paragraph.<br /><br />FYI: some of these Journey Legacy reissues have new remastering that is worse than the previous 1996 remastering while some have the 1996 remastering:<br />Infinity (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)<br />Evolution (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)<br />Departure (remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues)<br />Escape (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)<br />Frontiers (remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues)<br /><br />This was an amazing CD with lots of great songs and the most natural-sounding production of any Journey album. As with the albums before it, there's some great, underrated guitar work, especially the solos.<br /><br />I initially thought this was a much better, fuller sounding version. I even initially posted a favorable review. All of the Journey remasters and reissues seemed to sound great and better than the originals, until I realized something is missing. The sound is very compressed.<br /><br />When I first listened to the CD, it seemed fuller sounding. It seemed great...at first. I started to wonder why I began listening to the remaster less and less. Then I dug out the original CD. I realized how instruments that jumped out on the original now just all blend together on the remaster. Drum hits that popped out before are softened and now in the background along with every other peak, making for a very generic, modernized and cloudy sound. The definition and clarity are gone.<br /><br />Feel can be hard to describe or pinpoint, but the feel and excitement of great albums like this are destroyed by this kind of mastering that has become the norm for new albums and reissues alike. That feeling that made you had with the original will eventually (or instantly) disappear with this version.<br /><br />It makes no difference how loudor full the CD sounds compared to the original. When they eliminate all of the peaks, the music overall loses its power. All of the accents are gone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the record companies (and sometimes the artists) simply want their discs to be as loud as possible. The only way to do that is to compress the music by lowering the peaks and bringing up the valleys.<br /><br />It's easy to think initially \\"it's bigger, fuller and louder\\" but over time you'll wonder why you just don't enjoy it quite as much anymore. The punch is taken out and gone. Parts of songs that used to be loud compared to other parts are relatively reduced in volume and there's no longer those big contrasts.<br /><br />If you don't believe it can be that bad, for a great example and side by side comparison, search YouTube for two videos titled \\"Loudness War is killing music\\" and \\"The Loudness War: Iron Maiden (Part 2)\\". (Neither are my videos). You'll see and hear what I'm talking about. One compares Dire Straits' Money for Nothing from the original CD vs. the remastered CD and the other compares Iron Maiden's Wasted Years from the original CD vs. the remaster.  It is the exact same effect as on this remaster.<br /><br />Here's some other compressed remasters I've wasted money on that should be avoided. I listened to these for a long time before I realized what was missing from the music. This is by no means a complete list. More remasters these days are overly compressed than not. Simply, these are some of the ones that I own and am really glad I never ditched the original CD's.

1401222668|5.0|Watchmen chronicles the appearance of costumed vigilantes in America in the 30s, asks itself and its readership about what would it really take to become one, and deals with the consequences of the appearance of the true superhuman. And it poses the ages-old question, starihht from Juvenale's satires: \\"Who watchs the watchmen?\\"<br />Well, the answer is in the physical existence of the book itself: We, the readers, do.<br />In awe, horror, fear, disgust, wonder, amazement, confusion, terror, excitement, lust, kinship and denial. Like any true classic, it creaes a whole art  form and genre in and of itself, while covering the wole spectrum of human experience and feelings.<br />The sperhero is a very apt metaphor and allegory of what people subconsciously are or would like to be. That's why Watchmen resonates so deeply with so many people. There's Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II masquerading his insecurities behind the costumed vigilante's persona; Silk Spectre II basically livbing out her mother's fantasies until developing a taste for it on her own; Kovacs's/Rorschach's denial and self-delusion and refusal of a world that only hurts  you carried to appalling uncompromising extremes; Hooded Justice's sadism; Nite Owl I's living out juvenile comic book fantasies; the Comedian's use of the mask to get away with anything, hide from the horror of the worlds and at the same time point at its fallacies by baring them for all to see, while still being the one to actually get the joke and eventually be the butt-end of it; Captain Metropolis's barely masked fascism and racism; Veidt's superiority complex and desire to be always the best at any cost.<br />And the one and only real superhuman of the book, Does this mean only wackos would be driven to superheroics? Not in my opinion. This reminds me of Philip K. Dick's Clans of the Alphane Moon in which seven groups of mental patients break out of custody on their forgotten asylum planet and build a crazy civilisation, staggeringly similar to our own! Dick's little book is a satire and a divertissement more than anything, and I remember an interview with Moore stating the same of Wtachmen, which would be confirmed by the book's closing quote.<br />After all, with its alternative history, black humour, and a masked vigilante Comedian as a linchpin character, what could it be?<br />And once again, as with every true classic, its allegories and insights are timeless, so that Moore stating in a recent interview that the modern superhero has much to do with America's obsession for tactical superiority is literally confirmed by Dr. Manhattan allowing just that here. This and contemporary works also confirm what Moore said about superhero comics still stuck int the loop Watchmen (and to a lesser exent Mller's Dark Knight) creaed some 25 years ago.<br />Commenting upon the insane technical prowess that the authors, Moore and artist Dave Gibbons show here, would turn this into a full lown essay and I am sure nobody's even read tis far... But to the few who soldier on 'd like to recommend to watch every oanel and picture closely and repeatedly, taking their time and frequently coming back to previous pages: They'll be rewarded by a plethora of details and transitions that do not disturb the reading but enrich it when not acknowledged, and that enhance your enjoyment of it once fully noticed! Especially noteworthy is the comic-inside-a-comic Tales Of The Black Freighter. The story in itself, and the way it is intertwined with the main story and commented upon in it, provide at least two more layers of signification, meaning and interpretation.<br />This timeless masterpiece belongs on the honour shelf of every sensible reader's bookshelf!ilar to our own!

B002ZCDR88|5.0|I'm at a loss for those who don't see this album as creative genius. Perhaps they are pissed it wasn't Lady *aga who thought of it.  I agree this is nothing like her prior works, but Leave Your Sleep is as relevant as all her prior solo work. To me this album was so out of the box in a quiet way, it may be overlooked and misjudged, which shows how much courage it takes to create an album like this one.  Each song is based on a poem written by poets of long ago, their stories are interesting and thought provoking and through her incorporation of words, the songs are confronting, meaningful and inspiring. The musicality is spot on and is matched so well to the flow of the meaning and lyrics of each song, as is her amazing voice. All is seen through a child's eyes... now that could be the reason some don't understand.

0439023491|4.0|Plot Summary:  Katniss and Peeta have survived The Hunger Games, and their families are now ensconced in Victory Village.  Katniss is doing her best to retain a part of her old life, and she still escapes to the woods whenever she can, but nothing is the same.  Peeta won't talk to her after she revealed that her love for him was faked, and now her good friend Gale is jealous of Peeta.  Before leaving on their Victory Tour of the districts, Katniss receives an ominous warning that she'd better be on her best behavior, or her loved ones will suffer.  Everywhere she goes, there are signs of a rebellion brewing, but Katniss can only focus on keeping her family safe.<br /><br />(THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY: BOOK TWO)<br /><br />Has my ardor for The Hunger Games Trilogy cooled a bit?  Not really, but I didn't think this second book packed quite the same punch as the first.  In some ways Catching Fire felt like a repeat of The Hunger Games, but with that one criticism aside, I will say that it was one of the fastest reads I've had all summer.  I've been sitting on this copy for the past eight months because I didn't want to dangle from the tremendous cliffhanger I kept hearing about at the end of this installment.  I feel bad for anyone who has been waiting since last September to read book three, Mockingjay.  At least our wait is short, and book three will arrive shortly.<br /><br />Since this is the type of story that I can't review in any kind of detail for fear of divulging a spoiler, I'll just discuss why I like this series in a general way.  When the television show Survivor first aired in 2000, I was instantly smitten.  I wanted to be on that show and match my wits and survival skills against the group.  The Hunger Games are like Survivor, but with the danger ramped up 100 percent, and it's impossible to put the book down while Katniss and Peeta are battling for their lives in the Capitol's twisted playground.  I think each of us secretly yearns to test ourselves in a survival situation with no holds barred, and when we're rooting for Katniss and Peeta, we're really rooting for ourselves.survival situation with no holds barred, and when we're rooting for Katniss and Peeta, we're really rooting for ourselves.
B00005JLPK|5.0|The film gives a colourful rendition of Frida Kalho's life,played engagingly by Salma Hayek who physically resembles her.Diego Rivera(\\"I paint what I see\\") is superbly played by Alfred Molina.Kalho's paintings now possibly are more famous than Rivera's mural works due to the inseparability of her life and work,her paintings are her biography.Born with the Revolutionary generation,we get the early meeting with Rivera in which she shows her paintings to the great muralist of revolutionary Mexico.Prior to this we get the early trolley crash that debilitates her for life,preventing her having children,and waging a life-long battle against pain,but giving her the time to paint.She specializes in portraits.Her work uses vibrant,beautiful colours.     Rivera,being a philanderer, marries her following 2 divorces,in 1929.Her pain and Diego both contribute causes of emotional trauma as well as being the sources of her art.Both artists shared a similar political viewpoint as communist militants.Kalho says she `suffered 2 grave accidents in my life.One in which a streetcar knocked me down...The other is Diego.'Her father is an Austrian Jew and photographer who wants her to get on and her mother is a traditional,pious, lady from a Spanish-Indian background.The film is shot in the \\"Blue\\"House where she was born in Coyoacan, and lived with Diego from 1929-1954.We see the parrots,monkeys,peacocks,dogs roaming the residence.Her love of nature is shown in her work,she suckles on the teat of an nanny with Aztec mask.Her self-portraits are replete with monkeys and parrots.Her mother is Mexico.Diego is her frog prince.     In 1932 Rivera was commissioned to paint a major series of murals for the Detroit Museum, and here Kahlo suffered a miscarriage. While recovering, she painted Miscarriage in Detroit, the first of her truly penetrating self-portraits. The style she evolved was entirely unlike that of her husband, being based on Mexican folk art and in particular on the small votive pictures known as retablos, which the pious dedicated in Mexican churches. Rivera's reaction to his wife's work was, however, both perceptive and generous: \\"Frida began work on a series of masterpieces which had no precedent in the history of art - paintings which exalted the feminine quality of truth, reality, cruelty and suffering. Never before had a woman put such agonized poetry on canvas as Frida did at this time in Detroit\\"     Rivera has exhibitions and work in America but the mural he did for Rockefeller in New York was destroyed because he would not remove the head of Lenin.Frida called it `Gringoland'and they are shown working back in Mexico City in the Casa Azul and San Angel studios.Frida is dressed in Tehuana costumes of Indian maidens.They both pursue affairs,he with her sister then with an actress.She with a singer or later after their remarriage with Trotsky(Rush)before he gets assassinated with an ice pick by a Soviet agent.She exhibits in Paris, wanting to be independent of Rivera.Her many operations are hinted at and her deteriorations(her toes then her leg gets amputated),wearing a steel corset.He was protective of his 'chicuita'.     Taymor, the director, creates atmosphere through the playing of Mexican folk songs, the animations of several of her paintings,shooting in the arcades and courtyards of municipal buildings and the ebb and flow of their love.She embodied alegria-lust for life and displayed an extrovert, black humour and sharp wit behind her unibrowed features,concealing her vulnerability and extreme sensitivity.Although a surrealist,her painting is realistic,down to earth,depicting real images in the most literal way.Her art interweaves fact and fantasy, both equally real.Her art is intensely personal, visionary about sensations,statements of mind and feelings of pain.Her only exhibition in Mexico comes before her death, when she is carried into the gallery.Rivera praises work'acid and tender,hard as steel and delicate and fine as a butterfly's wing,loveable as a beautiful smile,and profound and cruel as the bitterness of life'.They both thought each other was the better artist.He made the\\"Blue\\"House a museum after her death,dying 3 years later.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Due to word of mouth I was expecting the worse from Clash of the Titans. Was this film going to be another special effects ride with little or no character development?  This seems to be a trend in fantasy films since the Scorpion King. Some of my fears we realized, but there are definitely some handsomely mounted scenes and some of the action sequences are original. The story is essentially the same as the original Clash of the Titans, which featured Ray Harryhausen's last foray into special effects. Harryhausen's stop-motion effects were more whimsical and fit the time period better, but this film offers more sophisticated computer animation. However, is this kind of slickness really necessary for a fantasy film? I find these effects a much better fit for science fiction. For example, the Medusa in this film almost moves too slickly. Harryhausen's rigidly moving stop motion Medusa was somehow creepier. Still the scenes with the Medusa are quite chilling, and the background design of her lair is very atmospheric.   The action scenes are well mounted, but they tend to be a little over done. CGI has allowed directors to pull off stunts they otherwise could never accomplish, but periodically they are so outlandish they stretch believability. Fortunately, the special aren't quite as ludicrous as those seen in 2012, which bordered on the ridiculous.  I don't think the cast in this feature is charismatic as the original. How could you lose when the original featured Laurence Olivier as Zeus, and Maggie Smith as Thetis? However, in this latest film Liam Neeson makes an imposing Zeus, and makes the best of the material he was given. At times the screen play is even more simple minded than the original, but there is so much more action you barely notice.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I first discovered VH around 1980 with the album Women and Children First. Absolutely blew my mind! I had to find out more about this band and their guitarist so I went back and bought Van Halen I and II. Boy was I blown away!!! VanHalen I is the album that single-handedly brought hard rock back to the forefront. It's 1978...Disco had completely taken over the airwaves...VanHalen wanted to change the landscape and they successfully did just that. This album also introduced a new young hot shot guitarist to the world named 21 year-old Edward VanHalen.  His skills were quite remarkable for the time as many first-time listeners had never heard guitar playing like this before-it was jaw-dropping lightning fast, explosive, over the top, innovative and ferocious with dive bombs and high-pitched harmonic squeals peppered over David Lee Roth's howling, bluesy vocal range, with elements of using classical sounding notes in his playing. Most notably was his uncanny technique using one and two handed tapping on the guitar fretboard that really caught people's attention as heard on the iconic \\"Eruption.\\". After this album countless imitators followed suit-the VanHalen band and business model (the first rock band to create a band \\"rider\\"- a band list of requests and/or demands) influenced so many bands it's very hard to count them all. No other guitarist since Hendrix changed the face of modern rock guitar playing like Eddie did. This album is still heralded as one of the biggest groundbreaking records of the last 30 years.

Keep in mind the code included is only good for 1 use!<br /><br />I listened to the book on my way to work in the mornings (I have an hour's drive one way) and it was interesting.  The author gives examples and it's easy to follow.  After I took the exam and got my results it was nice to see there were no surprises.  Yeah, I may not have articulated the results in the same way, but the exam really did the trick in \\"discovering my strengths\\".  To me, the price of the book made it worth that exam result.

030745455X|5.0|I just finished \\"Th girl Who Played with Fire\\" last night and immediately picked up the third book in the Millennium trilogy, I was somewhat critical of the first book in the series because of what I considered the slow build-up for the first 150 pages or so; but not this one.<br /><br />I suppose it was because of the background gained from the first novel but I will say this novel can stand alone. In this book, we follow the the adventures of Lisabeth Salander as she returns from the trip where she has visited many countries worldwide and even then we learn she has pursued her own sense of justice while in Grenada.<br /><br />Upon her return to Sweden, she is enjoying the wealth she accumulated at the end of the first book and then she uses her hacking skills to follow an investigation in which her former friend and lover, Mikael Blomkvist has become involved. In due course she becomes the primary suspect in a triple murder.<br /><br />Blomkvist is convinced of her innocence and runs his own investigation of the crimes while the Swe4dish police pursue her. Lisabeth, however, is running her own hunt for a mysterious figure unearthed by Blomkvist's free lance reporter (who is one of the three murder victims).<br /><br />This book is very fast paced and presents an uncompromising picture of the Swedish police system and procedures id addtion to telling the story of Lisabeth's troubled past. To provide more details would deprive the readers of finding out for themselves ans the author leaves clues sparingly and drops revelations at the appropriate spots.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book but feeling fortunate that I had the third novel in the trilogy on-hand to begin reading immediately.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I was a huge VH head by the time this album dropped and like most people into VH, I bought every single album they put out during the DLR era. VanHalen's Fair Warning album is perhaps VH, the band,  musically in their finest hour. It's also their darkest-sounding record. The music here sounds a bit dark because it reflected the growing tension between DLR and Eddie at the time, and Ed's spinning out of control drug and alcohol use, but besides that, its probably the best guitar playing Eddie's ever done on an entire record. Eddie's brilliant opening to \\"Mean Street\\" and the song \\"Unchained\\" are the best highlights of this album-there is drop D tuning throughout much of this whole record-another reason for its darker feel. The execution and speed of his playing on each song is innovative, mind-blowing and brilliant and it's the fastest I've ever heard him play-like he's taken his frustrations out through his playing. In fact the entire band played excellently throughout this whole record, which is why a lot of people feel (me included) that this is their best ENTIRE original (no covers) record.
B000001FSP|5.0|Though she had some middling success in the 1960s with hits such as \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"As Tears Go By\\", Marianne Faithfull never really hit it big in North America.<br /><br />In 1979, she released the landmark LP \\"Broken English\\", which was a major success despite the fact it was as non-commercial as you could get at the time. It was one of the first albums by a female vocalist to come with a Parental Advisory sticker, years before Alanis Morrissette and Pink. Thirty years later, Marianne's work here still blows the other ladies out of the water.<br /><br />Hard living and an excessive lifestyle had taken its toll on Marianne's pipes, but this only served to make her voice more interesting and there's no way the Marianne of 1965 could have sold these songs. The raw, bourbon-and-nicotine quality of her voice cuts right through you, especially on the last two tracks.<br /><br />The material chosen for this album is much of the reason for its' success. Kudos must be given to the musicians' sound and the production which remains very uniform throughout, yet in no way gets boring or monotonous.<br /><br />The title track sets the tone for the entire album. \\"Broken English\\" is like a musical steamroller, with guitars slashing through it's mesmerizing bassline and \\"bubble\\" synth sounds as Marianne sings of terrorism in Europe.<br /><br />\\"Witches' Song\\" belies its title, as the music is definitely not as dark as one would expect. It's actually one of the \\"happier\\" sounding songs of the album. Though the melody is different, the tone reminds me of Peter Gabriel's \\"Salisbury Hill\\".<br /><br />Things slow down a touch on the bluesy \\"Brain Drain\\". The bridge of this song is the best part and the lyrics are clever.<br /><br />\\"Guilt\\" starts off quietly, then gradually develops a quite funky mid-70s sound reminiscent of \\"Brother Louie\\" or \\"You're No Good\\". This one also has excellent, intriguing lyrics and by the time the saxophone and keyboards come together at the end, this is one smooth, fine work of art.<br /><br />The arpeggiated intro of \\"The Ballad of Lucy Jordan\\" was basically stolen 5 years later by Pat Benatar for \\"We Belong\\". This tale of a suburban housewife's broken dreams has become one of Marianne's signature tunes for good reason. Her weary vocals make this the definitive version despite being covered by various other artists.<br /><br />The album begins to take a darker, more dangerous turn on the up-tempo \\"What's the Hurry?\\".<br /><br />\\"Working Class Hero\\" finds Marianne sounding almost exhausted and beaten-down, and the music sounds like a grenade waiting to explode, except it never does.<br /><br />Then all hell breaks loose on the climactic \\"Why'd Ya Do It?\\". A strange hybrid of punk and reggae, Marianne lets her cheating lover have it with both barrels on the album's most famous cut. A razor-sharp guitar slashes through Marianne's raspy, bitter vocals and the organ swells up after each chorus. Thirty years later, the language is still shocking and it's a no-brainer that this song was placed last, because after this, there's really nothing else left to say.<br /><br />Thirty years after its release, this album is still as potent as ever and remains Marianne's masterpiece, and one of the best albums by a female vocalist ever.is one smooth, fine work of art.<br /><br />The arpeggiated intro of \\"The Ballad of Lucy Jordan\\" was basically stolen 5 years later by Pat Benatar for \\"We Belong\\".

B003RV43X4|2.0|I ordered this for rent last night from my Sony XBR9 TV.  What's with the small picture on my screen?  There are thick black bars on all sides of the picture, and the movie takes place in a small area in the center.  It was hard to see what was happening in the movie since the picture was small.    My TV operates normally when viewing satellite, but this movie does not take advantage of the area on my screen.
B001E75QGG|3.0|The special effects are spectacular, the action superb(for the most part).but the writing  and story are less than steller..Its worth a rental  for the visual fun of it(in blu ray)  and  for Fords  performance(and swan song?) ..3 skulls.Best:the bomb blasted town and Ford.Worst:Story and screenplay.
B0034G4OU4|2.0|Yawn.<br />One star for the phony pretentious banality of the story.<br />One more star for some good nature shots in Bali. I would give more for the Bali part, out of patriotism, if it were not so artificial. Even the market scenes are staged (did you notice how all people in the market are foreigners?). The Indonesian protagonists (the old man and his wife, the single mother and her child) are cliches and unreal.<br />Waste of time.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|What a remarkable surprise of a film this is. I think Pandorum suffered from its promotion as a horror film -- simply because, while it does contain a horror ement, I would classify it more as a science-fiction thriller than a horror picture. The movie's promotion -- what there was of it -- was inscrutable. When I watched the film, I thought I would be mildly entertained by a monster-of-the-week-trapped-in-a-shuttle sort of cast-elimination movie.<br /><br />What Pandorum is, instead, is an intriguing survival-horror drama set in a post-fall techological environment. Characters must cope with a world that has collapsed, in this case the interior of a very large ship bearing all that is left of humanity. The ship is also populated by mutated creatures who are the result of the passage of time applied to generations of passengers bearing an enzyme in their blood (intended to \\"jump start evolution\\" when they reach their destination).<br /><br />In the decay around the characters, we see the shadow of the world they've left behind. This helps increase the sense of hopelessness these characters must fight, and encourages us to root for them -- even as we understand how high are the stakes for which they play.<br /><br />Fine perfomances are turned in all around, although I found Dennis Quaid less than compelling.  (He's been \\"phoning it in\\" for a few years now as his career winds down.)  The star of this picture is, without doubt, the superb Ben Foster, who is excellent in every role he plays.  He has a depth of emotion to him that is at once resilient and vulnerable; these are the perfect notes for the protagonist of a survival-horror film.<br /><br />German-born Antje Traue is exotic and captivating despite the layers of grime under which she must perform.  Cung Le is convincing and heroic in a role that is really a glorified stunt man's part, but then, Cung Le is a competitive mixed martial artist and kickboxer, not really an actor.  (The script, wisely, grants him no English lines.)  Eddie Rouse (who played a thug in Pineapple Express) is creepy, while Cam Gigandet and misplaced Boondock Saint Norman Reedus are barely present (and not missed when absent).<br /><br />The movie is visually striking and, I have to admit, has an ending that took me by surprise.  The \\"is it real or is it a mental delusion\\" angle is there but not overused (always a danger with material of this type; if it gets too confusing the audience stops caring if the movie's events are an illusion).  It's also reasonably well paced, and the film's creature-villains are real enough to be truly scary.<br /><br />If I have any quibbles it is that there is no explanation given for why Cung Le and Antje Traue are such accomplished fighters.  Yes, they have awakened in a world that requires them to fight for survival... but are kung fu skills spontaneously visited on you under this kind of stress? There would seem to be plenty of training opportunities... but no margin for error when to lose means to be killed and eaten, not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />A movie I did not expect to enjoy as much as I did is therefore a better film than it has any reason for being.  I enjoyed Pandorum; fans of science fiction and of survival horror will enjoy it too.who played a thug in Pineapple Express) is creepy, while Cam Gigandet and misplaced Boondock Saint Norman Reedus are barely present (and not missed when absent).

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a story about tough decisions and doing the right thing. It is a story about morals and faith. This portrayal of a man is what every man should aspire to be. The best movie of all time. Great acting,funny,serious issues,entertaining, not a bad  moment throughout. A real lesson for life in any age. Some movies are a waste of two good hours, this movie is time well spent.
0812973992|5.0|McCann's writing has me hooked . The eleven or twelve characters who narrate this novel are welcome around my table at anytime. They are my kind of people. Their  deep passion is unique to each and  springs from their soul.  I foresee  rereading this book many times (3 times already) just to have their company. It makes the struggles of a spinning world more bearable just knowing where to find  them.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's been along time since I liked a whole CD.  The sound is very polished for a bluegrass/folk sound, but it's just gorgeous.  Great lyrics, moving harmony.  This CD is fantastic and I'm excited for their future creations.

1592289444|4.0|I read this book knowing the controversy this book has caused. Many believe this has never happened. Many believe that that the author stole the story from a fellow soldier, many believe that the story is true but exaggerated and many believe that the book is 100 percent true. I believe the second one and third one. The author was a polish soldier at the outbreaks of world war two and was captured by the soviets and was sent to a soviet prison but in 1942 records show that Sawomir Rawicz was released from prison and that he was sent to Iran as part of Anders army, a polish army stationed in Soviet Russia, that was made up of captured Polish soldier, that was sent to the middle east and fought along the allies in italy and then relocated to England after the war. Soviet records differ from Sawomir Rawicz account of where he was imprisoned and what he was imprisoned for.     There is proof the story did take place. A Intelligence officer actually debriefed three men who claimed they escaped from a siberian prison and recently Witold Gliski has claimed that Sawomir Rawicz stole this story that happened to him.     I believe this could have possibly happened but not to Sawomir Rawicz. The story could be a little exaggerated but it is an amazing read. You will not put this book down. So forget if this is true or not or if the author is lying read the book and decide for your self.
B00003CX5P|3.0|When Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace came out in May 1999, some people said the movie sucks.  Some people said they liked it, while others said it was just \\"OK\\".  Well, that's how it's been for the last eleven years.  This is a movie that has gotten mixed reviews.  What's my opinion of this movie?<br /><br />It's OK, that's all.  So...it gets 3 stars.<br /><br />This is a movie that could have been so much better, but George Lucas botched it up.  There are a number of reasons, so I'll explain.<br /><br />First of all, the script.  Oh, the script, the script, the script.  The script is HORRIBLE!!!!!  George Lucas wrote one draft and then gave it the stamp of approval.  I don't get it.  It's so wordy.  This is a movie that the average person is not going to be able to memorize, unlike the scripts from episodes IV, V, and VI (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi).<br /><br />Second of all, midi-chlorians.  Why was this concept used to give a scientific explanation for The Force?  Why was The Force explained at all?<br /><br />Third of all, wooden acting.  A lot of the characters are so stiff, so wooden, and so boring.  I know the political talk isn't the most exciting subject matter in the world, but at least have the characters show a little emotion and personality.<br /><br />Fourth of all, the higher technology.  Why is the technology more sophisticated and superior to the technology from episodes IV, V, and VI?  This movie is supposed to take place 40 years before Episode IV - A New Hope, yet the technology seems like it would be more suited for a movie that takes place 40 years after Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi.  The only hint of inferior technology in The Phantom Menace is that of ships needing help from a \\"booster\\" to go into hyperspace.<br /><br />Fifth of all, the slaying of Darth Maul.  What on Naboo was that?  Obi-Wan Kenobi is hanging on for dear life several feet below where Darth Maul is standing and looking down at him.  Suddenly Kenobi looks in the direction of where Qui-Gon's lightsabre is lying on the floor.  My question is this:  With Kenobi several feet below floor level, how can he see Qui-Gon's lightsabre from that vantage point?  The lightsabre is completely out of his view.  Does he have X-ray vision?  Another thing - Why does Darth Maul just stand there and watch as Kenobi jumps up, grabs the lightsabre, and swipes him?  Maul had every opportunity to swipe Kenobi in those several seconds.<br /><br />Why was Darth Maul killed off to begin with?  He's one of my favorite characters in the entire six movie saga!<br /><br />Sixth of all, Jar Jar Binks.  Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh Jar Jar Binks.  He was SO annoying.  He was meant to provide comic relief in place of R2D2 and C3PO, seeing that C3PO was being built at the time and was not a companion of R2D2 yet.  Instead, he single-handedly ruined the movie, or at least came pretty darn close.  Plus, I didn't find him that funny.  It was dry humor at best.  He was meant to appeal to little kids.  I really believe that if I was seven years old when this movie came out I wouldn't like Binks.  Seriously.  If there was a Worst Movie Characters Of All Time Hall Of Fame, Jar Jar Binks would be a first ballot Hall Of Famer.<br /><br />Seventh of all, Anakin Skywalker.  Jake Lloyd was given a script to act like the little kid he was.  Not entirely his fault.  His character showed no hint of possibly developing an evil side in the future, not even in the most subtle way.  His character comes off as very child-like and uninteresting and shallow, for the most part.  His interaction with Padme is awkward.<br /><br />Eighth of all, the pod race was too long.  It was great visually, but I get the feeling that George Lucas wanted to just show off what he can do with CGI technology, which leads me into my next point...<br /><br />Ninth of all, there was too much CGI technology.  George Lucas fell in love with CGI technology and overused it.  That'swhy the technology in the galaxy far, far away is so much more sophisticated in the prequels compared to episodes IV, V, and VI.  It makes no sense.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is just OK.  There are some strong points to it, but the negatives outweigh the positives.  Some of the positives are the musical score by John Williams, which I feel is one of the best scores in the whole six movie saga, the high intensity lightsabre fights with Kenobi, Jinn, and Maul, and the battle scenes on Naboo are visually stunning (just pretend Jar Jar isn't in those scenes).  I also like a lot of the costumes, such as Queen Amidala's arsenal and Darth Maul's.<br /><br />I dismiss this movie as basically a kiddie flick.  There are lots of kids in this movie, unlike the original trilogy, which didn't have any kids that I can remember.  I think George Lucas deliberately loaded up Episodes I, II, and III with kids so he could market all the toys to the kids through the movie itself.  But it's funny how Episodes IV, V, and VI appealed so much to kids, yet the movies didn't have any kids in them.  My point is that you don't need to include kids in these movies in order for the movies to appeal to kids.  The CHARACTERS are what get the kids interested, not some no-name kids who are taking up room on the screen.  Think of characters like R2D2, C3PO, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, the Jawas, etc.  Also, the spaceships and weapons get kids interested as well.<br /><br />All the scenes that are supposed to be \\"funny\\" instead come off as childish.  There are a lot of distracting things that appear on the screen throughout the movie, thanks to Lucas getting carried away with CGI.  Everything is overdone.  Also, a lot of the characters are just plain funny looking.<br /><br />I was glad that George Lucas bounced back and got back on track with Episode II - Attack Of The Clones, and better yet, Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith.<br /><br />May the Force be with you.<br /><br />Strike that.<br /><br />May the midi-chlorians be with you.ompared to episodes IV, V, and VI.
