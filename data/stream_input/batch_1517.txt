B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is an amazing game I wanted for a long time. It is very addictive. You could call it similar to a board version of Age of Empires (AOE). If you are an AOE fan, you will definitely like this game. The best part of this board game is the randomness that is introduced in it by keeping the board flexible. You can arrange the board in whichever fashion you want to make a totally new game every time. Hence each time you play this game, its an awesome, new experience.<br /><br />If you like to play strategy games, build cities, settlements, trade resources with other players.. then this is the game for you.<br /><br />I cannot think of any drawbacks of this.. its simply great!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love Ice Age Village. It's a lot of fun to watch you're village grow. If you love Ice Age you will love this game.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This trilogy is unbelievably hot! I'm addicted to reading this kind of book now. My friends & I can't stop talking about it. Can't wait for more!!!
B0000029J5|5.0|I didn't like it as much as another of his albums that I have until the second listen. Now, I can't get the songs out of my head. His guitar work is wonderful. Recording quality is delicious!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am completely caught off guard and surprised by all the negitive responses to this book... maybe people only want to read \\"real\\" life when they read or maybe they are jealous of the characters, I dont know. I think everyone is disappointed there isnt a sex triangle or sparkly beings... But I read all three books in this series in a 3 day period. (and a lot of sex later...).<br /><br />Christian Grey has such a human quality to his character minus the billions of dollars. He deals with real life issues that many people face and the darkness that surrounds those issues as well as the healing quality of life. I found the honesty surrounding him a breath of fresh air for a male character. Ana's character is a bit less real then Christians, however, the character is well developed and deals with Christians issues as many women would.<br /><br />I have both recommened and purchased this book for friends and look forward to re-reading the series. Even if BDSM is not your thing, the love story is well worth the read. Much better then most other \\"popular\\" books right now.

0783225725|5.0|Package and disc were perfect, no damage of any kind. Played perfectly.
B00846REIS|2.0|I read some reviews that this is better than or like 50 shades.  I disagree.  Gideon, a name I am not in love with, is arrogant, and nearly a rapist.  He seems like a jerk to me.  Not my favorite book.  I have read so many better.  Guys... A girl does not want to be raped just so we are clear on this.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|When Linkin Park began their experimentation period with 'Minutes to Midnight' it became difficult to tell whether I was still a fan or not. The first two albums were about balance between all members of the band, so when we started getting pieces that focused more on individual members we got some hit and miss music. 'Hands Held High' is still a joke to me and so are a few other songs they've written, but with 'Living Things' we have an album full of return to balance. Its still taking lessons from 'A Thousand Suns' with all of the electronica elements but overall its a successful album. Nothing special and nothing awful as a whole. When they announced that this would be a return to form I was excited. Then the single came out and I wasn't devastated, just disappointed. But it grew on me and the album itself has as well.<br /><br />1. Lost in the Echo 4/5 - Admittedly the first couple of notes threw me off a bit, but the overall sound and flow of this was a good way to start off the disc. A very 'LP-esque' track to help the transition from the last album to this balance.<br /><br />2. In My Remains 5/5 - Easily one of the more rock-focused tracks on the album, also focusing on Chester's vocals more than Shinoda's rap (Shinoda unleashed to his full element has proven to be a mistake for the band). Feels like it could have worked just as well on 'Minutes to Midnight' if all of Hahn's parts were taken out, but I'm glad it sounds the way it does. It has been a long time since the guitarists and Hahn met each other in the middle and this is where they do it for the first time in years. Excellent track.<br /><br />3. Burn it Down 3/5 - Here's the single, so no description of it is needed as its all over the radio. Overall not what I would call a stand-out track. Shinoda's bit hearkens back to their overtly-political leanings and doesn't really work for me, but Chester does decent with the vocals and I enjoy him here. To me this song felt more forced. Its grown on me butstill not a favorite from the album.<br /><br />4. Lies Greed Misery 1/5 - I hate this song with a burning passion. I never mind when the hip-hop influences leak through but this sounds like club music to me. From the Skrillex inspired sound to Chester's throw-your-hands-in-the-air chorus this just didn't do it for me. I have friends who love it and consider it a stand-out track, but this just felt more like something that would have been a semi-interesting b-side and nothing more.<br /><br />5. I'll Be Gone 5/5 - Another balanced track where you can feel all members working in unison. I absolutely love Hahn's light, floating overlay with Chester's soft vocals leading into a well performed chorus with a harmonizing Shinoda showing that not only is he a decent emcee but he can sing incredibly well (anyone remember the 'No Roads Left' b-side? Amazing track). This is without a doubt one of my favorite tracks in a few years.<br /><br />6. Castle of Glass 5/5 - Another example of what happens when the band steps outside of their wheelhouse and still maintains a balanced sound. Shinoda's string/horn arrangement sounds great here, and the soft vocals from both lead singers is outstanding. Semi-pretentious lyrics actually work well here. The sound is dangerous in the beginning but runs into a more soaring sounds that feels uplifting. Nice to see them pull things like this.<br /><br />7. Victimized 2/5 - A metal song could work for them in theory, but this quickly pumped out electric punk-metal song sounds cobbled together. This is the 'Blackout' of this album. Unimpressive, raging for no reason, and thundering its one I skip almost every time now.<br /><br />8. Roads Untraveled 5/5 - The music box intro with Shinoda's piano overlay is fantastic, I was hooked from the beginning. His vocals once again remind us how good of a singer he can really be, and his harmonizing chorus with Chester is amazing. Possibly the best song on the album right here. The split chord guitar segment with the beautiful vocals actually really perfects the song and I think this will be a staple live song.<br /><br />9. Skin to Bone 3/5 - This one felt like 'Burn it Down' to me. It was nothing fantastic, nothing awful. Its just there. It has an ok sound and some decent vocals, but it does nothing daring or exciting at all really. Sort of a background track. Crunchy beat at the end though, I enjoyed that.<br /><br />10. Until it Breaks 2/5 - I just can't stand when this song kicks in. The first half is absolutely brutal to me. Shinoda's distorted rap and his electronically repeated \\"Like dat dat...da da da dat dat\\" just annoys me. However, the last third of the song is quite beautiful. Brad Delson sings by himself for the first time on an LP album and the results are interesting and memorable. Its just rough to have to wade through the first bit of it. Reminds me of when I first heard 'Hands Held High' because it had an absolutely stunning outro but the song itself was ridiculously stupid.<br /><br />11. Tinfoil 2/5 - This was billed as an instrumental and was likened to 'A Cure for the Itch' and 'Session' but it is, in reality, just a drawn out intro to the next song. It seemed in this album that they learned to not have so many tracks full of dead air ('Empty Spaces', 'Fallout', etc...) but then there's this song. Its an interesting intro for the final track but had no business being separated from it.<br /><br />12. Powerless 4/5 - Excellent song with a crawl. Consider 'Tinfoil' just part of the song and you have an excellent track that clocks in at nearly 5 minutes to make it a long, balanced, great Linkin Park track.<br /><br />There we go guys, track by track breakdown. This is some of the better material they've released in the last 10 years, and I'm happy I bought it. On this album you won't find some of the stuff you did on the previous ones. There are no excessively-political tracks that leave the album lacking in a timeless quality, nothing like 'WhenThey Come For Me' that just complains that fans miss the style of the first two albums. This is just LP taking what they learned in their experimental phases and applying it with success. Not every track is a winner, but no doubt hardcore fans will worship this like they have every single song and album they've put out since their inception. For the rest of us its still a good album. Support the band, but from their website, Artist Direct, or from a show or something. Lets make this a higher selling album than the previous two and hopefully we'll get more of this quality of music.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Downloaded when the game was free, and would have gladly paid 4.99 for it.  Enjoyment for adults and kids alike.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend of mine and must say that I really enjoyed it.  It was well written and had great characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|this movie was amazing upon its first release. i had no knowledge about the complete edition until a week ago. and tonight i found out what a lie my life had been without it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have seldom read such a captivating \\"sci-fi\\" story. I normally never read the same author again before I've read something else, but this time I don't know if I'll be able to resist the temptation to start straight away on book number 6. This might just be my next favorite author!
B005LAII0S|5.0|This was pure fun and enjoyment. Totally enjoyed it with our kids and came out feeling so happy.Actually, saw it twice in movie theaters.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This a great hidden object style of game.  And its nice to have a story behind the game.  Great Game!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never write a review of any book.However,this book is the worst book I have ever read. My 20-year old and 40-year old friend talked about this book and I thought this book must have been a good erotic book. Therefore, yesterday I downloaded the sample and decided to buy it this morning.<br />This book is not worth buying and reading. Full of crap!!!!!<br />I regret buying this book.I have no idea why it is a best seller.<br />The story develops nowhere.<br />Can I get a refund from Amazon?
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|its ok I thought there would be more to it then what it is. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I wanted more ghost hunting.
B00005KARK|5.0|\\"Dumbo\\" is one of the great old Disney animation classics about a woeful little circus elephant born with abnormally big ears, who initially becomes the butt of many cruel jokes and treatment by the other circus animals.  Great animation, simple story, minimum of dialogue to bring the plot forward, and some really well crafted sequences with songs like: \\"Elephants On Parade\\" (a very surreal seq. for a Disney film), and  \\"When I See's An Elephant Fly\\" (wonderful song and seq. where wisecracking crows become father figures for the fatherless little elephant, and push Dumbo to finally discover that his big ears are actually a prime asset, allowing him to fly like a bird).  These and other choice sequences make this little film (only 64 mins. long) a memorable cinema treasure for children and adults alike.<br /><br />Also containing some DVD extras, included is a historically interesting and nicely delivered separate audio track on the whole film, talking about the various artists who made it, as well as the actors (all uncredited) who supplied the dialogue voicing.  Superb film print in this particular DVD issue.  Highly recommended!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its a hey fun game to play with your friends or anybody! The only problem is the ads but still a fantastic game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful book! The characters were believable, the premise palpable, and the storyline flowed like melted butter. I felt bad every time I had to put the book down, and couldn't wait to steal some more time to read it. It wasn't hard eying the action in my mind and settle down amongst them. Maybe it's because I've done that type of work, but I could even smell the grease and oil and feel it under my nails, just like described with the characters.<br /><br />It also passes my trivial \\"but is it technically correct\\" test. It seems as though the author does posses some knowledge of what tools/object the characters were using, and how they used them.<br /><br />I really loved how I was able to immerse right into the story without having to learn some 'new' history, untangle some historical mystery (though there is a bit of one, it isn't necessary to the basic premise of the story) or leave planet Earth. The story could easily play out in the very near future and it isn't a stretch to imagine it happening.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I'm going to be diving into his other books soon!
B0063IH60K|5.0|keeps me busy and helps me pass the time. always can count on solitaire to do that. keep up the good work
B002IE2JF0|2.0|If you're looking for a movie with a great premise but so-do execution this is the one for you. I tolerated it and found it watchable because the lead actor gives a decent performance and I like the era. However the person(s) in charge of historical accuracy and costumes should be fired. Everything looked like Xena Warrior Princess and the \\"Vikings\\" didn't act like Vikings at all, be it their customs, their dress or their symbology. The script was half assed and the direction/cinematography was crap.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is fun jumping over things and ducking under stuff! I hope you enjoy this game!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album feels like a mixture of everything that is brilliant about Linkin Park. They have done it again.<br />I cannot wait to explore this album more and see them perform these songs.<br />I love how this band lets all of its members combine their individual strengths- I think that is what makes them truly great. That and the fact that they really love what they do, and it shows in their work.
B0086700CM|5.0|cool game . just keeps you busy can't stop playing. keeps the kids busy too. you get better everytime you play
0345803485|2.0|Over hyped, over kill...just over. I was expecting so much more. I mean they ban the book in Florida. I have read sappy romance novels with more va va voom. Sorry...
0307341577|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked how the author wrote the book in parallel with present time along with the time building up to the murders.  It helped with character development and allowed me to empathize with the Day family members.  It kept me guessing as to who was really responsible for the murders and how the day of the murder was going to play out.  The main character, Libby, was not a likable person by nature (by the design of the author I'm sure), but by the end I empathized with her and felt her become more honorable.  The story left me feeling sad for everyone involved and was reminded of how a few poor decisions can snowball into a whole series of unfortunate events.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|HOMELAND, as a number of the reviews here make evident, is best appreciated by viewers who enjoy intricacy of plotting and serious acting.  The two leads each deserved the critical recognition they received. Less subtle, less mature, less cerebral viewers had best stick with more action oriented stuff.  They just don't have what it takes to enjoy HOMELAND.  One of the best shows on one of the best TV seasons ever.

B008D19WBQ|5.0|Can't wait,<br />seriously can't wait!<br />i have been waiting for this release since 2006, hope the image & sound quality are pristine.<br />it's a great year for blu ray, i think it's time for Seinfeld also to appear on blu's
B00008J2PG|4.0|You'll have heard of Monsignor O'Flaherty of course.  No? Well, whisper here now 'till I tell you.  He was real and not one of them \\"Barry Fitzgerald\\" made-up priests.  He was called \\"The Vatican Pimpernel\\" because he managed to save over six thousand Jews and escaped allied POW's from the Nazi sharks during the second world war.  Gregory Peck plays him in THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, a made-for-TV mini-series in 1983.  Now the mini-series has been put together into one.  By the way, the title, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, comes from two sources:  a monsignor was entitled to wear a scarlet band at the waist of his black robe, and and as you'll recall surely, they were the same colours as those of the Nazi flag.<br /><br />Now our own Christopher Plummer - a darlin' fellow - plays the nasty Nazi who has a white line painted across St. Peter's Square to mark the boundary of the Vatican State.  Now with Plummer on one side and Peck on the other, why you can see that the battle is drawn.  And by the by, Plummer gives a strong performance as SS-Obergruppenfuhrer,(don't worry now if you can't pronouce it, the war is over), and not one of his show-offy turns as he  did at other times.  The same is true of Gregory Peck, seen here in his later - and better - years.<br /><br />THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK has great shots of Rome and the Vatican, and the story is suspensefully told - lots of scary parts - with the duel to the death between between the priest and the Nazi its centrepiece.<br /><br />The cast of THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK is strong - watch for the fine Italian actor, Raf Vallone, always worth watching, and of course in those days you couldn't have Pope Pius XII in your movie unless you had John Geilgud (now Sir John I'll have you know).<br /><br />THE SCARLETT AND THE BLACK also has a nice surprise waiting for you at the end.  It's an important history lesson that goes down well.<br /><br />Peace,<br />P the G
0099579936|1.0|This book is a bit like dog poop on your shoes or spinach between your teeth.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app works PERFECT on my kindle fire.  I love being able to keep all of my notes and ideas in one place.
B007XH6BPG|4.0|Personally I love this CD! All but the name. Squackett? Why not Hasquire? (Hay-Squire)I think they should have just labelled it as Squire and Hackett and left it at that. \\"Squackett\\" while humorous, may be a bit too corny. But anyway...As Steve and Chris are no longer \\"spring chickens\\" I was originally worried that this Cd would contain a lot of slow pensive numbers, exhibiting more of Steve's classical tastes with Chris filling on bass. I am happy to say that Squackett is not like that at all. The introductory title song \\"Life Within  A day\\" lets you know what you are in for with an upbeat number and a killer electric guitar solo by Steve.  A lot of the songs are very upbeat and even some of the slower songs that begin with only a classical guitar, end up unfolding into some amazingly rich and layered progressive music. On the second song \\"Tall Ships\\" Chris Squire creates one of the best, funkiest, bass lines I have ever heard from him. LWAD never really lets up.  Songs are all of a shorter nature with only two of the nine coming in at just over six minutes. The cd moves from song to song with no song ever wearing out its welcome by going on too long.<br /><br />Vocals are shared with some lead by Steve and Some lead by Chris with them ending up singing together on every song. Chris Squire's bass is \\"prevalent\\" in the mix, but never over powering. You can tell it is there and you know it is Chris but it is never pushed to the front of the mix so that is all you can hear.  His bass almost becomes another lead instrument. Steve Hackett's guitar work is his typical signature work featuring acoustic, classical and electric. One negative may be that the lyrics on some songs are very simplistic and repetitive, probably the most noticeable on \\"Storm Chaser\\".<br /><br />I have seen a couple of reviews of this CD that did not speak all that highly of it. One of the most ridiculous statements I heard was that it sounded like a Steve Hackett release. What's it supposed to sound like!? Yes? Genesis? Is everything going to magically change completely because Chris Squire is on bass? Chris has performed on Steve's songs before. This is just their first total collaboration. Yes, it does sound like a Steve Hackett release with Chris Squire on bass. And, to me, that is the beauty of it. I got exactly what I expected from a Hackett release with the wonderful added bonus of hearing Squires signature bass and his vocals. They seemed to use a lot of sensibility in creating this album. They never get too experimental and really do nothing to alienate either Hackett or Squire fans. Maybe one \\"epic\\" number would have been fun but I feel neither musician is at that point right now. The shorter songs allow them to showcase more varied styles and also appeal to the mass markets \\"pop\\" sensibility for more standard length songs.<br /><br />So...after all of this, should you purchase it? Most definitely! I feel a fan of either Squire or Hackett should enjoy LWAD. You get the best of both worlds. No 5 stars because I would have to be totally blown away by it or it would need to be compared in relationship to their other releases, of which there are none. It's a fine work, still better than 90% of the other meaningless dribble that now passes for pop/ rock music. It is as solid as any other Steve Hackett release and Chris Squire adds icing on the cake!

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I will say that the sole reason I bought this is that it was cheap. I didn't have much of an expectation that it would work like I wanted it to, but it was inexpensive enough that I figured it would be worth the gamble. My TV has a coaxial S/PDIF output, and my stereo amplifier only had analog RCA inputs, so the only way to route the audio through the stereo has been to juggle cords around or just forget about it. However, I just moved into a new house and figured that it would be a golden opportunity to set everything up like I wanted it, so I got this little device.<br /><br />First of all, it's small. Like, the size of a camera battery pack small. And, it's powered by USB. It comes with a wall wart so you can plug it in, but the energy it requires to run is practically negligible. It's switchable for TOSLINK or coaxial digital input, so no matter what you're plugging in to it, it'll work. Besides a loud pop when it synchronizes with the digital audio stream it's also seamless. One small caveat is this, however: make sure that your digital output from whatever device you're plugging in to it is set to output a 2 channel stereo stream. If you try to run Dolby 5.1 in to it your reward is a deafeningly loud machine-gun pulse of information it can't decode, and if you try to run mono in to it rather than splitting the signal between both channels, it only outputs on the left channel. For me this meant telling both the Xbox 360 AND the TV to output on 2 channel stereo; after that, it worked perfectly.<br /><br />I haven't gotten to use it a whole lot yet, but it seems to work perfectly with the DVD player, and I haven't noticed any jitter out of it. I also haven't tested it with a scratched DVD, so I have no idea what it will do when the stream is abruptly interrupted. So far, however, it seems to do everything the much more expensive units do, it can easily be hidden behind the stereo equipment, and works well with my aging (and ailing) stereo setup. One day I will probably buy an amplifier with a digital input; until then, I think this will work just fine.obably buy an amplifier with a digital input; until then, I think this will work just fine.

031603441X|1.0|As another reviewer said he has just become a caricature of himself. There are lots of drawn-out boring stories from childhood and guitar riff instructions. Additionally, he has a giant ego, seems oblivious to his \\"mishaps\\" (always someone else's fault), immature and unapologetic. I love the Stones but this made me dislike Keith Richards - do yourself a favor and don't read it if you want to stay a fan. Read Clapton's book - it is great!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|When I first received this I could not figure out how to make it stand up like it was in the picture.  The video on the Amazon website at the time was for a little different style (probably a previous edition), and there were no instructions included.  I struggled with it for a day or two ... then figured out how to get it to work.  So happy with it now that I ordered one just like it (in a different color) for my wife's Kindle Fire.

0345803485|1.0|You have got to be kidding me! You want us to pay more for the kindle edition than for the paperback? The kindle costs NOTHING to produce as there is no paper or manufacturing involved. You only have the royalties to the author, advertising (if there is any) and profit for the publisher.

B00846REIS|3.0|I read this book about a month after finishing the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I really did enjoy this book, but the similarities to Fifty Shades was too much...dominant, screwed up, rich, sexy man who never has a serious love, falls for a girl the first time he set eyes on her. He too has a fear of her leaving him and will do anything to keep her, he has nightmares, a secret past. She has major insecurties and doesn't feel good enough for him.....etc, etc...<br />I found the story line much more faced paced then fifty shades, but the character and relationship development lacked in comparasion. I will definietly be reading Deeper In You when it is released, but so far i choose Christian over Gideon!!!

159514188X|4.0|I actually heard of this book long before i actually read it myself. From the beginning i was pulled into Hannah's story (Spoiler alert) and how certain people lead to her ending her life. It was an emotional page turner, completely overwhelming. As her story grew so did my empathy for her, as well as Clay. I actually felt like Clay, waiting for his part in all of her pain. I was completely engrossed in this book but i highly recommend this book for the age 15+ crowd for obvious reasons. The reason i didn't think this book deserved 5 stars was because at some points in the book i wasn't sure whether Hannah was taking on the recorder or Clay was thinking to himself. If that confusion was cleared up a bit, the book would definitely deserve 5 stars for sure.

0765316994|2.0|I'll admit it. I had hopes really high hopes for the book. I read the online first four chapters, and was sucked into Scalzi's easy, fun reading style; I swallowed the book in a bus ride or two. (Meanwhile, my copy of \\"All Clear\\" gathers dust--I ran out of momentum before Willis did.) But I value my fourth wall. I realized that this book was going to be at least somewhat about self-awareness, and the absurdity of television plots--but I guess I didn't see how far it was going to go.<br /><br />This book takes the fourth wall, and, in the first four chapters, leans hard against it. In the following chapters, it kicks the poor wall hard in the back of the head, starts kicking it in the belly, and finally slams its head into the curb with a violence usually reserved for performance art troupes. In the last chapters, and the codas, it rambles about drunkenly, looking around for a fifth wall that it can also knock down. Arguably, it finds a few.<br /><br />The book is suprisingly emotionally resonant about its two-dimensional subjects, especially in the touching last coda, but that doesn't compensate for the fact that it's a short-short story that somehow has been stretched into a book.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love. this. game. its a great way to pass the tk<br />e while waiting for a Dr or just sitting at home with nothing to do. my kids love it too
B0052VUNHC|1.0|wow, so much to roll my eyes about with this novel. I didn't realize it was a young adult novel and bought it because of the popular reviews. Well, this book was a big disappointment in credibility. Wish the Amazon info stated it was written for 18 year olds rather than a more mature (and discerning) reader.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I honestly can't remember the last book that was so good I snuck in chapters on my lunch hour, read on the train in the morning and still had the words ringing in my ears through the working day.  Solid storytelling, interesting and nuanced characters and a fun/interesting/twisting plot that really keeps you interested and rooting for... well that changes as it goes along, but I kept rooting the whole way.<br />I'm a massive sci-fi fan, and lately have been disappointed when I go outside of my safe favorites.  Lately it's been a real let down.  But this was such a pleasant shock, I look forward to tackling any of the other stories and books that Hugh puts out.<br />Pros: All of it.  Well done Hugh!<br />Cons: I think the end came about a bit quick, but I hope that is just because this was the Omni edition and more will come along next.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|so far the game is okay.  So far I haven't (except for this review) been able to leave. the game. It keeps saying my progress won't be saved so maybe after you write a review you can exit an save your progress if you can't I will be taking it off my kindle fire. I have no use for a game where I have to sit down and play the whole thing at one sitting. But for others that may be fine. Otherwise it plays well on the fire graphics are fine no lags and the zoom works great. So we shall see.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this game is amazing and challenging!!! I love the ghost pictures its so awesome! if you like finding games you should totally get this game!!!!!
B00382S9N2|5.0|Catchy music, beautiful storyline, amazing dance moves, Patrick Swayze.....there is so much to love about 'Dirty Dancing'. After all these years, it still remains a firm favourite. I was thrilled when I received my Limited Keepsake Edition on blu ray, and the quality of the movie on blu ray did not disappoint. The box the set came in is so sweet and holds all the pieces perfectly. Also it looks great on my movie shelf....Bonus! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. But be warned it's very addictive. I like that the game itself is very fast to play so you can easily get in several runs in a short amount of time.
0099579936|1.0|I just finished reading all three \\"books\\"...is this a joke?  It reads like an eighth grader wrote it.  I can not believe the hype over this story.  How is it that we as a reading collective have come to see this as inticing?  I was hoping to be wowed and sensually stimulated.  All I got was tedious, childlike clipped conversation between two completely implausable characters on meaningless, boring topics...nothing researched, just childlike \\"script\\" writing.  Such a major disappointment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|what can I say k LOVE this game its.the BOMB I enjoy playing it and once I start I never stop and its free so its perfect !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
0099579936|1.0|PLOT???  What is the plot of this book?  I really can't believe that I actually finished this book.  If you want to read about a young woman who has an orgasm every time she looks at a man's boxer shorts then this is the book for you.  The characters are underdeveloped and simply teenage like.  There is no suspense, nothing to looking forward to other than very crude sex.  If you enjoy reading fiction with plots, subplots and a good story line then just pass this one by.
B008BYXQJY|5.0|Overexposed is a great album, eventhough it did not reached the level of greatness of Hands All Over. This album is worth buying and even before it came out it already had a hit
B003SI3T5Y|1.0|It's two fading stars (Sarandon and Gere) and a fresh faced newcomer (Lopez) starring in the only movie I have ever walked out of.  This is crap.  We've seen it all before.<br /><br />Happily, after I left, the waitress at Denny's kept me on my toe's.<br /><br />Really, I left the theatre.  And I was the only one in the theatre.  I was so uncomfortable with all concerned I had to leave.<br /><br />Ergo, the Ultimate Omelette.<br /><br />I know that in the great somewhere some idiot thought that the combination of Gere and Sarandon and Lopez would make a good movie.  It's crap.  Like REAL CRAP.  The whole thing was ghastly.  He loves/She loves/He decides to dance to woo his wife back/the teacher loves him/he has feelings for her....<br /><br />It all winds up in a tasty omelette served by a tired and overworked waitress.  At Denny's.<br /><br />More coffee?
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Within the first 5 minutes my son was disappointed. I've read the books. This was a horrible adaptation. Beyond horrible. I wish I could give this movie zero stars. This could have been another Harry Potter movie hit but they ruined it. Sigh.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I was ready to fall asleep half way through the book. Realizing that there was another 200 pages, I really couldn't imagine what else could be thrown into this already sloppy novel. Zzzzzzzzzz.<br />I'm all for romance, but the mushiness, the  'you ok baby' and the rest of it made me feel nauseous by the end of the book.<br />I'm sorry, but I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone.
B005LAII0I|2.0|We saw this at the movies. There were only 3 or 4 sets through this whole movie. They kept showing the same shot of the castle or the same shot of her coming out of the water. The ending singing and dance scene was so out of place and odd. It felt like you skipped into Slumdog Millonaire. For adults it was bad but my kids enjoyed it. There were some funny dwarf scenes. As an adult I am rating it 2 stars. My kids would probably give it 3 stars.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game!  The pictures are wonderful.  The objects hidden well enough to be a challenge,  but not so well that it's impossible to find them. Story is cute.
B0086700CM|5.0|i dont know about anyone else but time flys when i play this game and it is super addicting i just cant put it down
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty cool. there is something for everyone in this assortment of games. some games can drive you crazy trying to best them though.
B0050BPIB0|5.0|This music artist writes and can play his own music.  He has an incredible voice also.  I love this cd and keep listening to it all the time.  He sounds great on this cd but if you can should look into buying his acoustic album because he is even better live.  I hope he keeps making music for years to come.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one game that is simple, enjoyable, and just like the movie. I could play it all day! I mean, I do...
B00133KFGW|5.0|This great story from August Rush movie inspired the director of Yada Dance Company to create a show Dance Rush. The story of orphaned child can now be seeing in the art work of 40 dancers highlithing the Ballet, Jazz, Folk and Contemporary styles. This motion picture August Rush shows us how music and dance can bring together the lost child and parents who are in love! Two people who give total comfort, warmth and love unconditionally.  The message from the movie is a positive one - Simply stay still and as you walk outside through your neighborhoods you will feel and see music! It is a romantic story with positive and warmth ending!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it fun and have have to jump and get the coin so the monkey can stay away
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has such a captivating storyline.  Its an easy read with a lot of underlying things going into the story.  Its a great and fun book to relax with.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I thought it was a different style of game. I like the mystery style, not the ones that are only find the picture. graphics are nice. happy it was free. both reasons is why it got 3 stars
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|A Thousand Suns started a great change for the band. Yes, Hybrid Theory and Meteora were great albums, but, just like the rest of humanity, bands grow and change. I for one love it! The album is a bit on the short side clocking in at 37 minutes, so it seems more like a sampling than a full fledge LP. With that being said, I love every minute of it and I am left wanting more. I cannot wait to see what they come out with next!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Great app, but it won't connect to Facebook, Twitter, or Google +. I'm new to Flipboard so maybe it's the design, but also doesn't look like it fits on the Fire well.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|First off, let me start by saying that I was worried with how A Thousand Suns would turn out and at first was somewhat disappointed.  This new sound took a few listenings and it began to sink in that this new style is something that brings a more distinct and enjoying sound.  Living Things built off of the many hidden positves that came from ATS and strikes a sound and feeling that anyone can enjoy. I was stuck on their hard rock/metal sound but quickly learned that they are just as good as with Hybrid Theory but they deliver it in a more varied style that you just don't hear from any other band.  They also brought just a little more of that edge back from their earlier albums but it is not overpowering and stuck closer to a very successful transition of ATS.  If you have been a fan of any LP albums and can appreciate the unique sound that draws in so many people to listen and they can master, this is the album for you.  Plus, there is many less filler songs from ATS.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I really enjoy this game but I hate how I have to pay for mini games. I don't want mini games I just want what I have been playing the past few days. Till it shut me off
1466401885|2.0|This book started in a fairly promising manner, then sort of lost it's way.  Travis borderlines on being a crazed stalker with serious anger issues.  And Abby has all these secrets which turn out to be kind of cool, but never really played out much, except in a small and unsatisfying side-story involving a trip to Vegas.  SO much silly drama between these characters!!  So much crazed obsession.  It got pretty exhausting and annoying to follow Travis and Abby's ups and downs and all the emotional games they play!  And, I think the writer was scared of writing a sex scene - she sort of glossed over them very quickly.  Was that because it was a teen book?  It sure felt like one.  I don't know. Pretty disappointing read, really.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|a fun hidden picture game preetty simple and enjoyable. diolouge kinda cheesy but not bad . shows picture  outline instead of sayinng the name of the object so that can be tricky.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have played many of these over the years and this one is up there with the best of them.  plus Heather's fingernail's are sexy.  you get to see her hand while she's holding a letter.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|If you want to teach someone or change their opinion on something, you could use this book.<br /><br />The Heath brothers (a Stanford professor and his brother who is an educator) propose six ways to make ideas stick.<br /><br />1.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|love this game! am totally addicted would recommend to everyone. great for all ages. cant put it down once I got started
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|hybrid theory was a classic album. not a bad song on it. and this group has lived off of that every since. fans are hyped and hopeful each time a new cd comes out and it takes them a week or two to accept and admit this group just isnt good anymore. so other than my review you'll see nothing but 4 or 5 stars til at least the 2nd week of july when realization hits. there isnt one song on here that id consider a hit. but they will make money on their name alone. then they'll make more on the token mix tape they do a year after each cd comes out.i admit im one of those hopefuls but after this effort they have lost me as a fan. i can sum up every song on the cd in one sentence. rehash of rehashed songs they cleaned off the scrap room floor. these songs are B-side material at best. im just glad this cd was only $4.99 on amazon. still i feel ripped off tho.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love it I haven't put it down since I started it starts out simple an the difficultly increases as u play. I would def. Recommend for anyone who likes hidden objects games an a llil challenge.!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Amazon needs to give their books ratings like movies.  I was offended by the language and what was shaping up to be a sexual encounter on the street among two strangers in the first few pages.  I stopped reading.  What a waste of money.  A rating or hint of content could have warned those of us who would prefer not to be exposed to this.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I was not to shure about this game at first. but after the first<br />half hour I was hooked in. I still haven't started with the timed version<br />but I'm saving that for later. all in all this is very good.
B00846REIS|2.0|I bought this book after reading the 50 Shades trilogy twice and wanting something similar.<br /><br />However this was way TOO similar and not near as intriguing. The characters lacked depth and it moved too fast.<br /><br />Eva was relatable but Gideon was way too much like Christian from 50 shades but not near as appealing, IMO. SPOILER WARNING: He was possessive, had nightmares, wanted to be her dominant but changed for her, etc. The only difference is I didn't fall for Gideon like I did Christian  and although I'd read the sequel it's not imperative.<br /><br />Basically she was a genius to cash in on the 50 shades phenomenon but in my opinion followed too closely and fell short. If you're trying to decide I'd go with 50 shades hands down. If you're looking for a follow up to it this is very close. Just be prepared to be a little disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play and nice options! Its quick and the price of free is great!  the game is quick and has multiplayer options and makes for a fun time!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it so much.Once I picked up my kindle fire I couldent stop playing!!!You should really try it. best game ever!!!!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Said to find a flute. Spent 20 minutes staring at it and right as I was about to give up decided, what the hell, click on the oboe and see what happens. Turns out that was what they were looking for. A black double reed imposter passing off as a flute? Unacceptable.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love yhis app. I use this app on my desktops, laptop, kindle and phone. I recommend this app to everyone.
1400049628|5.0|The product listed was exactly what I received in the mail. I am very pleased with my purchase and I will definitely come back to buy more from the seller. FYI, shipping was also fast!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I'll get this point out right now, if you are part of the music crowd who can't evolve past your initial introduction to a band you won't like this album. You haven't liked them for over five years, and you probably never will again. So all you Hybrid Theory and Meteora lovers, who are trapped in your small music box, just don't buy the album. No need to cry about it, they haven't been the band you loved for a long time, and they won't be going back so just move on. As for the rest of you still around, Living Things is pretty special. To me, it takes a lot of that experimental sound from A Thousand Suns but uses a song writing approach that mixes Midnights to Midnight with their first two albums. It's very clear that they could've never created this excellent new piece of work if it wasn't for the last album. This album has a lot of callings back to the old Linkin Park in terms of approach, not as much sound. What I mean is, rapping is back in a stronger way, the focus of personal songs have returned, and even the one instrumental before the final track is back. The sound as I brought up before takes a lot of the experimenting of A Thousand Suns but builds more focused songs like their previous efforts. Unlike A Thousand Suns, I believe this album is much easier to get into. With a great mix of heavy tracks, to slower more ballad like pieces Living Things is the culmination of Linkin Park's entire career. Where they go from here will be quite exciting.<br /><br />Current Favorites: Lost in the Echo, Castle of Glass, Victimized, Powerless
B007IXWL2C|5.0|HOT, HOT, HOT.  This trilogy was a true page turner from the first page to the final sentence. A solid story and exciting anticipation in each book. Congrats to the writer, it was a great read.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I had never heard of this type of puzzle game before but it has found a permanent home on my kindle.  The author makes regular updates with new puzzles making it well worth the investment. If you like sudoku or ken ken you will have hours of fun with this game.  Highly recommend it.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|too much auto tune. Did Adam's voice somehow get even more girly? What happened?? Bad CD. Cheesy POP. YUK Not even worth the $4.99 people.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Great educational game for kids, my kid just love it~!<br />Everything looks cute and kid-style, kids learn things while playing the game.
B008BYXQJY|1.0|This is nothing more than over processed Pop junk. Save your $4.99. Its not even worth that.  If Auto tune sounding guys that sound like girls is your thing....then u may like it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|How do you get the stagecoach to move? I have done EVERYTHING that it is telling me to do, and now nothing is happening.  please help!  Game works great on the kindle fire, also since a lot of people are having trouble with downloading this game on the kindle fire, try this, other games or books that you downloaded onto the kindle fire,  go through them and get rid of them,  with doing that you will give up more space for the game to download faster. Just saying!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|LP never seems to miss the newest sound coming. Living Things breaks all genres and creates a sound all its own. \\"Castle Of Glass\\" stands out as something not only unexpected but also pretty awesome. Lies, Greed & Misery turns their 90's metal angst into a modern twist of that. Should be the rock..or alternate..or whatever you wanna call this CD...The CD of the summer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I just don't like thy u have to play lots and lots of games to earn more coins that's all. :)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I find it a fun game. I played with my 5 year-old niece first. we both enjoyed it. had trouble at first getting out but hitting the &quot;stuff&quot; button solved that
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I very much enjoyed playing this game until I made it to a certain level and my kindle fire froze up.  I could not exit out either.  I finally got it to shut down.  When it eventually came back on I took game off immediately.  Hated to delete game but too many other good games to play that don't cause a problem.
B005HEU518|4.0|I won't spoil it, but I have one question. Are the writers trying to tell us that Dr. Beverly never experimented during Starfleet Academy?

B0080R7P8A|5.0|Can were a group so good that even one of their random leftovers is better than most group's entire careers. They were not only brilliant musicians but they made their own soundscapes. The Lost Tapes is chok full of great space jams. Each song on this generous 3 CD set is mindblowing.<br /><br />[DW]
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I have had my eye on this game for a while now but the $5 pricetag was a lot more than I wanted to spend. glad to see it as the faotd! I like that there are 2 modes available. one is timed and the other is more casual with no time limits. it does ask you to sign into facebook periodically but if u don't touch the screen when it says &quot;tap here to continue&quot; it won't ask and will move on to the next screen after just a few moments. I am definitely enjoying the game so far.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are incredible on the Kindle Fire. I'm looking forward to trying more games from this developer.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I am a huge Hybrid Theory and Meteora fan.  I will say when I first listened to Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns, I liked maybe a song or two in each.  For all those that feel the same way as I had (being that key word), listen to them, again and again.  It WILL grow on you.  Regardless of whether you are a fan of their newer music, or like I was, the old nu-metal LP, this album has it all.  I was close minded and hated M2M and ATS, but exposing myself to the music and listening to it through got me into it more and I still listen to those albums regularly.<br /><br />Living Things definitely mixes it up, with some HT and M2M/ATS songs.  This album definitely does not disappoint, except in the fact that it is only 37 minutes....I found myself wanting more.  I have listened to the album 4 times already and have forced myself to stop by removing it from my iPod, just so I don't \\"over-play\\" the songs.<br /><br />Overall, 9/10.  Great job LP.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I will definitley read the next 2 in the series!  At first, I didn't think I would like it because the main chracter, Ana, was so young, but as I kept on reading the more I couldn't put the book down.  When one cannot put a book down, you know it's a winner!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Fun for a 5 year old and challenging for a 34 year old. A whole lot of courses and doesn't use a lot of battery power. Perfect!
B005HSL626|5.0|this is so awesome and its free I have all of the blades besides the bamboo shoot blade fruit ninja lite is for ipod touch is better because there is a store if I where you I would get the game it IS AWESOME
0810993139|1.0|I think this book doesn't help kids be the best version of themselves; the older brother is a bully, offers advice to fool parents and be mediocre in life, and being the most popular kid in school is not the most important thing in life, or at that age! In one of the book series, Greg even mentions at one point that he does not want his baby brother to be born! Both Greg and his older brother lie to their parents! Rodrick even has a party at his parents house without asking their permission.<br /><br />I don't think this book promotes good family values, team spirit or basing your self-esteem on a loving family relationship, sports or intellectual capacity. Do not recommend this book or any in the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I love that I can access my ideas from anywhere - my home computer, work computer, iPhone,  and my Fire. I use it to track blog post ideas,  goals for work,  anything.
0307341550|3.0|This book starts out strong but sags a lot in the middle. It would have made an excellent novella or short story.<br /><br />There's a lot of \\"local color\\" in the middle which brings the narrative to a halt. When it picks up at the end, the ending is rushed.<br /><br />Also, the characters often end up speaking in the same voice. The 13 year old girl talks like a thirty-something. It's one thing to draw a precocious character, but this was ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, disappointing given the hype.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I am on the second book now and I can't stop reading. The auther truly knows what to write to keep her readers interested. I strongly recommend this book to any adult that whats some excitement in there lives, or just loves to read GREAT books.

0765316994|3.0|I am a fan of the Star Trek Star Trek series so this book seemed somewhat intriguing to me.  I enjoyed this book for the most part and found myself laughing at many of the humorous twist and turns this book took.  I also felt invested in the characters and wanted to see how things ended for them... SOMEWHAT SPOILER ALERT...but unfortunately this did not happen, or at least happen the way I would have expected.  The main characters stories ended abruptly and then the last 1/5 of the book was spent on characters that I had no investment in.  The ending did not live up to the rest of the book and seemed like a cop out.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Birds and I think Angry Birds Rio is a great update!!!!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|you keep saying these reveiws are obviously fake.<br />no this review is real.<br />obviously.<br />this game is suuuuper addicting.<br />I mean I admit its stupid.<br />but haha its still a cool way to have some entertainment.<br />everyone I know is completely addicted to this game.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|great game! my 8 year old loves it! I got it as the free app of the day for my kindle fire. beautiful graphics.
159562015X|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend when I was starting up my business and flailing a bit on where to focus my energy.  Once I used this to identify my strengths, I was then able to engage the services of others whose strengths differed from mine and made a well rounded organization.  Highly recommend this book!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This app can be fun but it's pointless. Plus, when you don't play it for a day you get like 12 notifications on your kindle, that say &quot;you have family's ready to give you some coins&quot; or &quot;come quick! your baby's ready to hatch. When you don't check the baby one because your sick of all the stupid notifications it runs away and you have to pay acorns ( one type of money in it) to get it back which the acorns are not easy to come by overall this app is a HUGE waste of time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great. As long as you keep up with it and go on everyday. You can connect with live players and rate and play at their villages. This game is suitable for all ages! I love this game and definitely give it 5 stars!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this app is layed out great. it is fun to look for the different hidden items. the dialog is not that great
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third installment of the fifty shades trilogy was wonderful. It held my attention and i did not want to put it down until I was finished. Ms. E.L. James did a good job with tying up the story (no pun intended). I look forward to more from her. Thank You
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Over the summer, I try to read books that have little to do with ministry, church or being a pastor. Enter The President's Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity by Nancy Gibbs & Michael Duffy. I can honestly say, there is no other book like this book. If you like history like I do, this book will simply fascinate you.<br /><br />The book starts with Truman and goes all the way until Obama, looking at how former President's interacted with sitting President's, what happened behind the scenes in their relationships, what was going on in the world during those presidencies.<br /><br />\\"I think we ought to organize a former presidents club,\\" said Herbert Hoover. \\"Fine,\\" answered Harry Truman, \\"You be the President of the club, and I will be the Secretary.\\" That unlikely exchange took place on January 20, 1953, at the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower as President of the United States. Nevertheless, as Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy explain, the \\"club\\" really began in 1797 when George Washington retired from office and became, by his own design, the nation's first former president.<br /><br />In The Presidents Club, Gibbs and Duffy offer readers a treasury of insight into \\"the word's most exclusive fraternity.\\" From the time of George Washington's retirement, the nation has known relatively few periods without at least one living former President. The last time that happened followed the death of Lyndon Johnson in 1973. In contrast, when Bill Clinton took office in 1993, no less than five former Presidents were living. Four are living today.<br /><br />While I didn't read this book hoping to find leadership nuggets, they were everywhere in the book. One of the things the authors continually emphasized was the only person who can understand what being the President is like are those who have sat in that chair. I think that could be said for being a leader, running a company, leading a church. While being the President is a larger scope, and considerably more stressful than leading a church or running a business, there are some similarities. While I was a student pastor, I was convinced I knew what it was like to lead a church. Now that I lead a church, I realize how little I knew and how few people understand what it is like.<br /><br />From that perspective, it turned out to be a great leadership read.<br /><br />Here are a few things that jumped out to me:<br /><br />-Judgment is not the same as understanding.<br />-Their greatest problem was never doing what was right; their greatest problem was knowing what was right.<br />-Others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.<br />-Don't confuse being `soft' with seeing the other guy's point of view.<br />-The greatest sin was remaining passive in the face of challenges.<br />-A good leader sets priorities--he doesn't just list.<br />-Promising great change and delivering it are two entirely different things.<br />-Once a president takes office, he learns that the office is its own arena, and that the tactics, tools, and talents that had helped him rise so far so fast were useful only to a point.<br />-Forced to choose between the unacceptable and the intolerable, leaders nonetheless have no choice but to lead.<br />-If you're doing big things, most of the time you're never going to be around to see them.<br />-If you aim for big change, you shouldn't expect to be rewarded by short-term history.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|After all the hype about how good this movie was, I was greatly disappointed. This movie is the biggest box-office champion of all time now ? Really ?? Why is that ? It's certainly not because of the story (which is a retread of 'Dances with Wolves', only with blue aliens instead of red indians). So I guess the reason is because of &quot;how&quot; it looked, which really doesn't paint too good a picture on Americans' intellect, does it ? I've always believed that good story writing/telling is more important than &quot;how&quot; you present the story. You can present it in life-like, hologramed, 3-D all you want, but if the story is second rate no fancy presentation is going to cover that up. While I can appreciate Cameron's ability to push the technical barriers of film-making, I wish he would have had just as much fervor in writing the story. I have no desire to sit down and watch this movie again.
B005LAII08|2.0|I was a bit disappointed in Pixar to have added crude parts to the film, things that they have not done before, and I was disappointed that they would fall into those, which many other films in different studios have done. I have loved Pixar for not adding those things in the past. This is not something I will let my small children watch. There were some scary parts that would be a little much for little viewers. I loved the story, loved the graphics. Amazed by the Animation- Pixar knows how to do it! But wish they would have kept it to the standard they have upheld in the past.

B0038P59A0|2.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes, it ain't.  Too little reasoning, too much gratutious violence.  Not bad for a Roadrunner cartoon, though.
B007V508CC|5.0|First off, I would like to state the I have seen Maroon 5 live in concert(last August with Train). They were awesome! I have been an avid fan since \\"Songs About Jane\\" and this album is awesome!<br /><br />Let me start out by saying that I listen to Hands All Over at least 2 or 3 times a week. So many wonderful songs. This album (overexposed) starts out with One More Night and ends with Kiss. The album really begins with a bang and ends the same way. It has something to fit everyone. Some tracks are upbeat, others are rather slow. I've listened to the album twice through and am on my third time. What I get from it so far, is that it is describing a dysfunctional relationship and the different steps that it goes through.I will definitely be listening to this cd faithfully!<br /><br />Oh and to whoever said that Adam was auto-tuned was completely wrong. See him in concert. He sounds just like he does live! One of the few artists that sound exactly the same in the studio and live.
B001HN6918|5.0|Sometimes sequels are just made to make more money for the franchise and end up being nothing but filler for a hour or so.  That is most definitely not true for this sequel!  The movie stands alone as a great family movie even if you haven't watched the first Kung Fu Panda.  I really enjoyed this movie and so did my children.
B00005ASOC|5.0|To say this movie was an influencer on my life would be an understatement; if you like writing and basketball, this should already be your go to film. But what (director) Gus Van Sant does here goes beyond magical in orchestrating Connery's and Brown's impossible arrangement. Brown's development hinges on Connery's mentorship, which is fostering throughout, but more so, Brown's conflicted persona constantly battles the curmudgeon character that Connery exudes throughout his performance. \\"An unexpected gift at an unexpected time\\" is just another classic scene in which we see the young Brown savor Connery's advice on life and more importantly women, as he guides him to the humble man he is trying up to be. Shot in New York, with a great supporting cast starring Busta Rhymes, it doesn't get much better than this for Van Sant's work.

0307959856|2.0|Lydia shows up on Pemberley's doorstep crying murder! Before her arrival Wickham and Denny stopped the carriage and ran off into the woods but neither returned... but which is dead and why?<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are throwing a ball and the night before the grand event the last person they expected shows up on their doorstep---Lydia. Only her arrival brings more than the usual chaos, it brings a murder to the estate. Who is dead and why? Is it foul play or something more sinister?<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed in the portrayal of the Austen characters, they seemed somewhat flat. It could have been set anywhere and with anyone other than Darcy and Elizabeth, which I believe, would have improved the story. I kept waiting for a spark that was not there. Austen fans can skip without worrying about missing something!
0345803507|5.0|Having finally finished the 3rd book--in less than a week after I opened book one, I've come to a conclusion that this is really one novel, not a trilogy--but I guess they had to publish it that way because no one would really buy a 1500 page single novel. However, it's really all one story.<br /><br />Like the 2nd book, the 3rd book gets much more into character and plot development and the highly publicized (and certainly MUCH over-emphasized by the press) BDSM aspects of the trilogy assume their proper perspective (a lot more LIMITED than non-readers assume). More emphasis is placed on the development of Christian and Anastasia's relationship.<br /><br />Like the first 2 books, I couldn't put it down. Very satisfying ending but found I still wanted more.<br /><br />Interestingly, this seems to be a trilogy that, while women find addictive, scares the pants off of men. I offered to let my hubby read the books after I was done (in fact, I encouraged him to do so) and he looked at me like I had 3 heads. None of my friends who have read the books have convinced any of their husbands/boyfriends/significant others to even give the book a chance. Frankly, there is a lot most men could learn just from the \\"vanilla sex\\" scenes. It must be the male fear of inadequacy raising its ugly head (if you don't read it, there is no worry about suffering by comparison). Personally, I think most women would be thrilled if their men picked up a few new ideas from the \\"vanilla sex\\" scenes!
0316056863|5.0|I laughed, I didn't cry, I mostly just laughed. But what else would you expect from a comedic genius like Tina Fey.<br /><br />Buy this book. Now. Do it.
0345803493|5.0|I could not put it down! I ended up reading the entire trilogy in less than a week. The second book is more well developed than the first one--and it will have you running back to the bookstore to buy the third one. The \\"erotica\\" is not as out there as the Guardians of Morality would have you believe. A neighboring county has banned the book from its libraries; meanwhile the libraries in my county have waiting lists of several thousand people waiting to read it even though they have several hundred copies!<br /><br />I probably wouldn't be comfortable with a 16 year old reading it but would have no issue with this book being read by a 22 year old (the age of the female protagonist in the book)
1451673442|5.0|No day should be ordinary, nor has it been with the help of this book!<br /><br />Simple & effective, it is aiding me in becoming the person I've always wanted to be!<br /><br />The Secret, the Law of Attraction & The Power have turned my life 180! I have gained Life as my BFF that's always got my back!! The cloudy sky always opens up for the sun to shine on me!<br /><br />*Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!*
0345803485|5.0|I could not put it down! I ended up reading the entire trilogy in less than a week. The first book is  a bit weaker than the other 2 (which I give both 5 stars) so don't judge this book until you have read the entire trilogy!

B005PK1G76|4.0|Wow. I like this product (Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Organizer) but I<br />only paid $9.99 a month ago and it has now almost doubled in price! Really<br />sucks because I was going to order another one for the stroller I keep in the garage<br />for walks in our neighborhood but forget it!
B000008HFX|5.0|Little did we know our very proper older-gentleman German teacher was a \\"head\\". To us, this was just weird music with German words we tried to figure out. Years later (how many I prefer not to admit), I tracked the song down on youtube (yes, there is an official video).<br /><br />When we planned our trip to Germany this year, I *had* to have a copy to play as we were driving on the Autobahn. Granted, it was not coming on the radio, but that was close enough...<br /><br />If you like their music, get this CD. The other songs, which we didn't listen to in class, were worth listening to!
1416914307|5.0|I had all of the other books in this series except this one.  I have read the series three times now...once through the library and twice after buying the books.  The Infernal Devices books go along great with The Mortal Instruments.  I can't wait to see how some of the characters tie together with their ancestors!  Hopefully that will be explained soon. Some parts were predictable, but there are still quite a few surprises in store.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun, no brain use game that keeps you coming back for more.  not much substance to it, but fun, nonetheless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun app to have. It really helps time pass by and it allows you to play multiple challenging games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I &lt;3 this game. I am so addicted to this. I can't stop!!!!! GET THIS GAME, IT IS AWESOME. it is challenging but that is what makes it fun!
030758836X|4.0|I read the pre-publication reviews of \\"Gone Girl\\" and couldn't wait to read it.  After reading it, I must say it is extremely well crafted and written.  It keeps you guessing througout as to what is going on.  I thought I had it all figured out, and I did have what happened to the wife figured, but wasn't even close to knowing what was behind everything.<br /><br />This is a book that will stay with you for a long time.  It is, frankly, disturbing to a degree that you will ponder it for some time after finishing it.  Very difficult to put down but the longer you read, the more disturbed you become.<br /><br />The only weakness, in my view, was the conclusion.  I found all of it in the realm of possiblity, until the end.  Then I lost my connection to it as a mystery that could happen.  Up to that point I believed it.  That is the reason for four stars instead of five.  I just couldn't buy the ending.
B006O3MU96|4.0|If you want a deluxe Christmas version, get this! If you already have normal Doodle jump, and don't wanna pay ANOTHER $0.99, don't there is already a (lesser) Doodle jump Christmas on the normal.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|I bought this speakerphone and loved the super slim footprint and cool design.  Sound quality was good, but I had ocassional problems with it connecting to my Samsung phone.  Most of the time it would connect immediately when I got in my car, though sometimes it could take up to 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />Fast forward 8 months later...  It failed.  The light came on and my phone showed it was connected - but no sound!  I tried to re-charge, re-set, everything.  Finally I wrote the company online (who apparently is somewhere not in the US) and they told me to contact Amazon.  But as it was over 30 days, Amazon told me to go back to the manufacturer.  So I tried again and again and now they do not even answer e-mails.  Horrible customer service.  Amazon should remove this vendor.  I know it's only $40, but still, it didn't even make it a year.  Huge disappointment.
0393088774|2.0|Paul Krugman is a socialist, and this book reflects his philosophies. As such, it has value in allowing the normal among us to understand how socialists see things. Indeed I would have given this book a higher rating had Krugman made any effort to limit his urge to demonize the Right (no, it wasn't Bush's housing bubble).<br /><br />Taken to extremes, if the goal of the Right is to enrich the top 1%, it is the goal of the Left to enrich the black underclass. When the rich get richer, they invest in companies which then hire more workers and society benefits. Giving more free things to the underclass means that more money goes to waste. Billions were spent on the Great Society programs that Krugman applauds, yet the underclass is if anything more entrenched and even larger than before.<br /><br />No, people shouldn't live live above their means, and neither should governments. People who can't afford houses shouldn't be given mortgages, and gov. shouldn't force banks to issue such mortgages (i.e., the CRA). And people who can't repay their home loans should lose those homes; to allow otherwise is to make suckers out of those of us who played by the rules and paid off our mortgages.<br /><br />You have a choice: You can watch MSNBC for a week or you can read this book. Krugman is less hysterical so, if you must do one or the other, read this book.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I loved the free version but I never wanted to but the paid version. Now I don't even have to pay for it! G5 games r amazing I love this game soooooo much.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie is really really DUMB.  'I just signed up for the money dude.'  'I had no idea we were going on a 5+ year mission.'  'By the way, now that we are 2+ years into this gig, what kind of bene's do we get??'  'Hey, is that a cigarette holder inside your helmut?'  'Kwoool.'  'If your glasses fall off of your head inside that space helmut, it's okay, just take the dumb helmut off.'  'Hey, what do you think is in this cave?'  'Oh, no! It's a mean alien!'  'Listen, there's a weird sound at the door, let's open it.'  'Oh no, it's a mean alien!!'  'Why don't you like us? I have to know.'  'Wow Dad, you look like you are my great great great grandfather while I am still so young and pretty'  .........at least the Alien series had Sigourney and a modicum of decent acting in it.

B007RE0RR8|5.0|This is a must have for Monster High fans. My daughter is a huge fan of the series, and since she takes care of them and collects them, I as a proud father buy her the dolls when I find them available. She was very excited to receive this cute Draculaura doll. I would recommend all Monster High collectors to get her. A must.

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I have always been a fan being blown away from day one with the song Linkin Park brought to the radio. over the years the sound did seem to become softer and more experimental, tryign new waters and taking chances. While all good, it is not what Linkin Park is and Living Things is a refreshing return to what made the fans love them.. an edgy pushing sound that drives you through from song to song and wanting more with each beat. it is only 1030 on release day and I am on my third play through of the album and will continueit all day. To Linkin Park, you knocked this one out of the park! homerun!
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|this made my kindle fire freeze up every time it was played. had to get rid of it. blah blah
B00364K6YW|5.0|Having read the book in college, I was also exposed to this BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. Hands down, this is the best version of this book to hit the screen. It is the most true to Austen's vision (If I had to guess). The subtlties in the acting, the chemistry between the actors, and the famous BBC eye for detail and quality makes this mini-series truly enjoyable--and I'm a guy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|it's easy to read and follow the weather. so far it's been pretty accurate too.  all in all it's a great weather app.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a great game. I see complaints in other reviews about the lack of directions, and hints. Directions are not needed - it's quite intuitive and easy to figure out, especially if you've played the Myst series. There are help files (called spoilers) in the journal, which really are quite sufficient. I would like the Map to be made more interactive - I'd love to be able to click on the screen I want and go, rather than go through the tedious retracing of a route. But then, I'm impatient! The graphics are spectacular, the movement is easy (though being Myst trained, I'd like to be able to turn around rather than just back up.) It's logical, and cumulative. The length is just about right - it took me about 2 half days to complete. I would have liked longer, but this was long enough not to feel disappointed when it finished. All in all, well worth the dollar. It's the second game for the developers, and the improvement from the first is easy to see. Much more complex than The Secret of Grisly Manor, their first. I hope there's more.
0345803485|1.0|Allow me to begin this critique with something very simple. This \\"book\\" is simply an erotic Twilight fanfiction (that is not a joke. That is how this all started) that somehow got published. I despised Twilight due to its incredibly boring nature, and the fact that the author inadvertently created the greatest villain of all time in Bella Swan.<br /><br />But this critique is not of Twilight, it is of \\"50 shades of suck.\\" (that is the title, correct? If it isn't it should be.) The writing is atrocious and quite frankly I am surprised anyone can understand the jargon of an author who clearly used a thesaurus for most of the book. No, I have not read the whole book because the plot sickens me. It is based around one of the most disturbing acts of sexual deviance (known as S&M) ever to be created by human kind. So, if the writing and the plot are both terrible, then surely the characters must be decent, right? Wrong. The characters mirror those of Twilight to a T (for the reason I stated above.)<br /><br />So, to be put simply, if you want to try this book I would advise against it. And while I am normally not one to insult the fanbase of a specific work of literature, I shall here. The fanbase of this atrocity, this abomination, this travesty upon mankind, are some of the most vapid, horrid, foolish people I have ever seen/hear/read. They have no taste whatsoever and if they did they would find something of higher quality to read.<br /><br />Never again should anyone be subjected to this terrible \\"book.\\"
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed the game very much. There is not a help/spoiler file, but it's really not needed. The one place I got stuck - throw the pretty box in the fire! The graphics are beautiful, the play is smooth. The sound is not as good as the sound on The Lost City, but not bad. Really, this would get 5 stars if only it was longer. I'd prefer something like Myst; something to take days/weeks to complete, rather than a couple of hours.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this is not a sexy read, it is stupid.  The writing is amateurish and the point of view is kind of embarrasing - it is as if the writer is trying to create, in her main character, what she thinks is every guy's fantasy - and she does so very amateurishly and clumsily.  It would be easier and shorter to tell you what is right about this book - nothing - than list all of the ways it is awful.  The sexual content no doubt is why most people love it, but even that is so badly written it isn't sexy at all.  Clearly, if women are flocking to read this book, we are in some serious need of decent erotica.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|Unlike Leod's review, you are glad Eddie Murphy didn't do a movie that leaves you with sex, cursing, crude, rude and uneeded filth.  What you walk away with is a profound message...do you have your priorities in life right, are you losing life because of the choices you make....but never seem to find an answer...so your life is leaving you unsatisfied.

B007IE4DSG|1.0|As a fan of the Beatles and George Harrison since the '60s, this release represents an insult to both the musician and his multitude of fans. A deceased musician cannot stop the release of music he would never have allowed out of the studio. What isn't wrong with this CD? The sound is uneven and downright unlistenable in places. The acoustic demos tend to be low in volume (the first two, for example), then \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" comes on at full volume. It seems the songs could have been properly mastered before releasing this CD.<br /><br />Aside from the unevenness of the technical quality, the music itself is rudimentary (the demos) or rejected by the artist himself (the \\"early takes\\"). One hopes there will be no volume 2.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD with no idea of what it would sound like. Would it be countrified National Harvesters-style takes on the originals or what? But this is classic Crazy Horse digging the bones of our heritage out of the Badlands and dressing them in new flesh. The effect reminds me of Dylan suddenly playing electric folk music. Not your grandpa's tunes.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|If you are looking for a stylus to take notes or do homework with, this is it. Its exceptional build quality, sturdy design, and predictability make it the best writing and graphing stylus you can buy.<br /><br />The Cosmonaut isn't based on some fancy, next gen capacitative technology; and that's a good thing. Its lack of features is actually its best feature. There's nothing to replace, no electronic pressure sensing to glitch out or distract you, just pure, stylus functionality. It's all about the writing, swiping, and tapping and really, that's all that matters. Furthermore, its simplicity also makes it durable. Take tough aluminum and wrap it in even tougher rubber. This thing is built to last. Other rubber and mesh tipped styluses I bought started cracking or otherwise failing after about a month of hard use, this stylus just refuses to quit.<br /><br />I used the Cosmonaut for an entire quarter of college, which involved nightly math homework assignments, daily note taking, annotating more PDFs than I care to recall, and a whole lot of just screwing about on a tablet. I used it to write sentences and equations,to draw graphs and diagrams, and also to just navigate around the tablet interface. It excelled at all tasks. There is little to no friction with the screen surface (unlike cheaper rubber styluses) and even better, its stiffer tip makes it a lot more predictable and easy to control. Other rubber tipped styluses, even expensive ones like the Wacom Bamboo, simply compress too much when they're being used. This makes it somewhat difficult to figure out exactly where the line will show up. This is not a problem with the Cosmonaut.<br /><br />There are those who will say that if you want accuracy, you should go with the Adonit Jot, and if you are a professional artist who must know *exactly* where your line is being drawn down to the last pixel, well yeah, nothing beats being able to see the line as it's being drawn. But for the rest of us, the additional hassle of having to deal with replacement disks and a noisy writing experience is simply not worth it. Besides, the Cosmonaut is pretty good at drawing too. I'm not a serious artist by any means but I do dabble in sketches from time to time and I've had no problems with the Cosmonaut's lack of transparent tip. It's simply predictable to the point where that ceases to matter.<br /><br />That being said, it's not perfect. While I like the wide-bodied design, I personally think it's ergonomics would benefit from a slightly smaller diameter. This would also help with its other problem: weight. As far as I can tell, it's machined out of a solid chunk of aluminum, which is great for durability--it also gives it a satisfying heft. But you really feel that extra ounce or two after an hour straight of note-taking. Future iterations would benefit from a drilled-out aluminum core. In fact, I'm thinking about doing this myself with my friend's drill press.<br /><br />All in all, the Cosmonaut is as good a stylus as you're going to find on today's market. Its bare-bones design might turn some people off because there are more feature-rich styluses available at cheaper prices, but really, this is the one to get. Its predictability alone puts it head and shoulders above the competition and its durability only elevates it further.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars (this system doesn't support half stars unfortunately)<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Predictable writing and drawing<br />+Super durable design<br />+Little to no screen friction<br />+Simple, effective design that gets out of the way<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It's a bit fatter and heavier than I'd like in a writing implement

0061122416|4.0|After too much non-fiction and a really great historical novel, The Alchemist fit nicely into my reading mix just as 2012 was turning into summer. A metaphorical, light read with some heavier things to think about was perfect for me! Pleased to have read something by Coelho but probably won't be seeking out another right away. Interesting footnote for me is the inclusion of Urim and Thummim in the story.

The interface couldn't be simpler and the setup is pretty quick. Two thumbs up!
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|The Offspring's been a band known for a long time to bring surprises and unexpected left turns to every CD they release. Even Splinter, one of their shortest and most bare-bones albums, featured the 1930s style track \\"When You're In Prison\\" and the ska jam \\"Worst Hangover Ever.\\" Ixnay on the Hombre had more than its fair share of joke tracks and genre-exploring too, so I'm not sure why certain fans seem so up in arms by Days Go By branching out at times. Especially when *no* songs on here are as throwaway as the likes of When You're in Prison or Don't Pick It Up, and when Days Go By otherwise has some very consistently fast stuff reminiscent of CDs like Smash.<br /><br />This one takes off like a rocket with The Future is Now and Secrets From the Underground, songs that have a real sense of energy and lyrics that embody the punk rock spirit of rebellion and change. Things slow down a little for the title track, Days Go By, a fun and nostalgic single that I think fades so well into the next song, Turning Into You, which once again cranks things up. Reminds me a bit of the band Rise Against while at the same time feeling like Trust in You off the last album, this is another cool one with an awesome bridge. The CDs first act ends with Hurting As One, which sounds like a Smash song, no questions asked.<br /><br />And then we reach the mid-point, a place where there will probably be a lot of controversy among some. Cruisn' California (Bumpin in my Trunk) is clearly intended as a joke song, the Offspring likely enjoying the opportunity to spoof the zillions of California-themed party songs and it's actually pretty catchy. That said, I do think they should have left it off the album, as I just don't think it fits all that well and its inclusion is probably not worth the anger of certain fans who can't take (or won't get) the joke.<br /><br />This is followed by the slow and thoughtful All I Have Left Is You, which I didn't like so much initially, (I thought the slow drum beat felt a little generic at first) but it's quickly grown on me. It's not a song that many will find to be a highlight but as a fan of the occasional slow track, such as Fix You, I think it's a good addition, especially to get to hear Dexter branch out vocally in ways that I've never heard him do before. It does pick up speed as it goes and it builds to something very cool.<br /><br />OC Guns is another tongue-in-cheek track that's going to have its lovers and haters. I hated it at first but it too has grown on me. Containing everything from mariachi sounds to turntables, horns, and a whole lot of other craziness, it's definitely a mixed bag but at the same time, it's a lot of fun to jam out to. Has a cool LA flavor to it, too.<br /><br />The final act of the album is more consistent. Dirty Magic follows, a remake of their famous Ignition track that sounds great. A big part of me wishes they'd instead chosen Forever and a Day to remake off that album, but Dirty Magic's a cool song and the more powerful chorus packs a punch. I Wanna Secret Family (With You) is just a fun song, with a cheery and up-beat vibe and a fast tempo. I like it. The CD then closes off with Dividing by Zero and Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell, two more epic punk tracks that long-time fans will definitely love. Slim Pickens is a perfect way to close off the album.<br /><br />All in all I think Days Go By is a pretty great CD from one of my favorite bands. It has just about everything I've liked about The Offspring making a return in some capacity. This includes their usual sense of humor in addition to the punk angst, so if you're hoping for nothing but the latter, you may want to adjust your expectations accordingly. Fans who love the fast and aggressive nature of the first act should let their guards down a little bit for a somewhat slower middle act; just enjoy the band having a good time, the fast songs return toward the end. Despite the jarring genre switches,Days Go By has enough on it to satisfy most everyone and I can't wait to hear these songs live.<br /><br />I'll also add that unlike a lot of albums these days, the record label has thankfully given Days Go By a proper CD jewel case instead of a cardboard sleeve, and the always-awesome Offspring CD booklet returns with lyrics and awesome illustrations and photos. Great stuff.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Let me start by stating John Carter is an excellent film.  It has action, defined characters, wonderful visual effects, and a comedic sense of whimsy. From start to finish, I was fully engaged and entertained.  Having read the books, and studied on the history of trying to get this film made (it holds the record for being in Production Hell), I was both overjoyed and overcome with feelings of trepidation.  Hollywood's history of converting a beloved book into film is spotty at best. This movie captures all of the major themes and elements of Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom series.  What convinced me this was a winner was the fact that Edgar Rice Burroughs (a fictionalized version anyway) was actually in the movie as John Carter's nephew, a position the great author placed himself in at the outset of \\"A Princess of Mars\\".<br />I recommend this film to anyone of any age (my 6 old enjoys it immensely).  I enjoyed this film so much, that I purchased this 3D Blu Ray/DVD Combo pack with the intention of upgrading my system to match it.<br />Enjoy the magic and watch the film.  Then I encourage you to rediscover the magic of the books.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|This is a two part review because you have two separate products to talk about!  First and foremost if you don't have a copy of this album then get this!  The material is second to none - one of the greatest albums ever.  I now have three copies of this album:  MFSL, Simply Vinyl and now this copy.  One reviewer found the sound a little bright for his taste - a possible digital source.  If it is from a digital source then kudos to the engineers cause they did one hell of a job!  The plus side is everything is soooo clear and immediate!  To my ears an excellent reproduction.  One of my favorite aspects of this album is the guitar work of Mick Ronson.  It is in full display on this baby - a real pleasure!  The DVD Audio CD is the real gem!  There is no better digital version of this album!  This is the way digital should sound!!

B002H3T3TM|2.0|I enjoy Michael Buble's performance, but I don't idolize him so I found the interspersed interviews to be highly annoying. If you are looking for a concert dvd, this is not the one to buy. Unfortunately, it's not possible to select concert footage without the interviews making it a two star dvd for me.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Linkin Park return to their roots with their most personal, strongest album to date. After 4 previous albums of experimentation, they have arrived at the sound which I believe they are truly comfortable with. Although I could be wrong because all of their albums tend to be different from one another so maybe their next one won't even sound like this. Who knows? Anyway we'll cross that road when we get to it. For now let's focus on \\"Living Things\\". Right away the title of the album lets you know that they were going with a more personal approach with this album as opposed to the political concept they went with on \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and touched on briefly with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\". The songs on this album convey a lot of human emotion and it takes the listener on a personal journey.<br /><br />The sound of the album is the most unique because Linkin Park took the best elements from all of their previous albums and blended them together to create the atmosphere for this one. I first discovered Linkin Park way back when in 2000 when I was 13, and I've been hooked ever since. As a longtime fan, (they are my favorite band after all.) I've realized that there are two types of LP fans. There are the ones that have enjoyed all of their albums and those who just like \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" and think that everything LP has made since then sucks. Well, I think that there are elements on this album that will appeal to all fans, whether they are old, new, narrow or open minded. They do have some heavy songs on the album but never really touch the \\"nu metal\\" sound of the first two albums and of course they have some softer songs as well. So let's go through all the tracks and review them to give you a better sense of this new album.<br /><br />1. LOST IN THE ECHO- The opening song is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the album and this one does so very nicely. This song could have easily been right at home on \\"Hybrid Theory\\" or \\"Meteora\\". It's the classic LP sound infused with electronic elements. Mike Shinoda lays the raps down on the verse while Chester Bennington handles the chorus and the screams. It's the classic back and forth between these two and this song shows why these guys have such great chemistry with one another. It's also nice to hear Brad's guitars again since they were rarely used or drowned out on \\"Suns\\"<br /><br />2. IN MY REMAINS- Track two begins with some electronics, piano, and synths before blending into a cool song reminiscent of \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" Chester handles most of the vocals on this track with Mike doing backup. You can really feel the emotion in Chester's voice as he sings the words. It's a really beautiful song.<br /><br />3. BURN IT DOWN- This was the first single released for this album, so most of you should have heard it by now. For those who haven't, the backbones of this song are the synth and electronics, while the guitars blend in nicely in the background. Again Chester handles most of the vocals while a nice quick rap from Mike fills in the bridge. The wall of sound really engulfs the listener on this song.<br /><br />4. LIES GREED MISERY- This is one of the heavier songs on the album with Mike handling the verses while Chester angrily eats the chorus. During Mike's parts, he is backed up with a nice techno-like hip hop beat but when the chorus hits the guitars and drums come in to fuse everything together.<br /><br />5- ILL BE GONE- Like \\"In My Remains\\", this song sounds like it was inspired by \\"Minutes To<br />Midnight\\". It's all Chester on this one and he lets his voice soar on this song. Not too many<br />electronics on this track. This one's all rock. It's not a heavy song but it's not at all slow<br />either. Nice tune to drive to I think.<br /><br />6. CASTLE OF GLASS- If I had to pick a favorite song off of this record, it would be this one<br />frankly because it sounds like nothing LP has done before. Honestly, if Simon and Garfunkel did an LP song, it would sound likethis. That's the only way I can describe it. This song takes you on a journey. It's got an acoustic, almost folk-like sound to it backed up by suttle electric guitars. Really cool song, IMO.<br /><br />7. VICTIMIZED- An awesome song but the only downside to it is the fact that it's only 1:47 minutes long! The beginning of it sounds like something off of \\"A Thousand Suns\\" with Mike singing but then the chorus jumps in with heavy guitars and a heavy Chester chorus. Mike handles a quick little rap in the next verse followed by the chorus again and then the song ends. Just when it sucks you in, it lets you go too fast.<br /><br />8. ROADS UNTRAVELED- A nice ballad, not too slow though, and is mainly instrumental with Mike and Chester only singing a couple versus. The piano is the main instrument but as it gets going, the guitars, bass, and drums come in to create a soothing, mellow song.<br /><br />9. SKIN TO BONE- This song is backed up by a nice electronic hip hop beat but Mike isn't rapping on this one, he's singing. His singing voice has really gotten quite good. Chester joins him on backup vocals and the track is a pretty cool sounding song. The sound of the song itself reminds me of \\"A Thousand Suns\\"<br /><br />10.UNTIL IT BREAKS- Hip hop commands this track with Mike handling the rapping duties. He utilizes the Rasta style raps that he did on \\"Suns\\" and this song almost sounds like it could be a sequel of sorts to \\"Wretches and Kings\\". Chester isn't aggressive on the first chorus though as it is more soothing than heavy. Brad Delson sings the second chorus.<br /><br />11. TINFOIL- LP brings a classic element back by adding the \\"interlude\\" instrumental track that sets up the final song on the album like they did on \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\". This sounds like a cross between \\"Session\\" and \\"Wake\\" and is just a nice little electronic-like song that seamlessly blends into the last track and lets the listener know that they are coming close to end of the album.<br/><br />12. POWERLESS- The final song on the album is a nice little ballad. You can sense the hurt in Chester's voice as he sings about someone he loved that was self-destructing and hurting him, but he felt powerless to stop it. Although it is a sad song it has a beautiful haunting sound to it. It's a nice way to end the album. Those of you who have seen Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter heard a portion of this song in the end credits of the film.<br /><br />So there you have it. The rest is up to you to decide if you want this album. I say, if you are a true fan, you will love it. Linkin Park has finally arrived at a sound that they are comfortable with and the lyrics are the most powerful, personal words that they have ever written. They have come a long way since the young men that they were when \\"Hybrid Theory\\" came out, but they have matured into one of the best bands on this planet. To me, they are like a fine wine, always getting better with age. They have proved that they are a force to be reckoned with and I think that this album is their personal best. 10/10

B0035WTJFW|5.0|I actually saw this movie for the first time in theaters many years ago when I was about 15.  This movie blew me away in the theaters.  So much so that I went back 2 or 3 more times just to see it.  Bourne Identity was in the theaters at the same time and this was by far the better feature to pay to see.<br />All these years later and it is still a great movie.  Just makes me feel good every time I see that opening scene with John working that computer and going to prevent the first murder.  Brings back memories of being a kid while still being an amazing movie.<br />Well worth the money to see this movie whenever I want.  It is a must own up there with Good Will Hunting, in that it deserves a spot on your movie shelf.
1468161660|5.0|Wow!  I read Slammed and the follow-up book, Point of Retreat in two days. I cannot believe Ms. Hoover is newly published. She has The Knack. I am now anxiously awaiting book 3.  I am sure all of us have read a book that did not intrigue you and you could care less if you finished that book other than the fact that you'd just wasted time reading some of it. Slammed is NOT one of those books.  You want to turn the page, you care deeply about each character and you are never quite sure what is going to come next and because Ms Hoover writes it so well, you don't care what the next thing is as long as it's not the end.
B004LROMWU|3.0|I've been watching Falling Skies for awhile now and I really enjoyed Season 1 so I decided to buy it. When I got the product everything seemed fine until I opened it up. The Disc 1 was just flopping around inside because the case broke, and not only was the case broken, there were several scratches and smudges on the actual DVD's, and I bought this brand new sealed up! I defiantly recommend Falling Skies, but this product needs some work.

B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I've been buying 3d documentaries since getting my 73 inch 3D tv and when I have company over I have my usual rotation of 30-40 minute long documentaries that elicit the requisite \\"ooohs and ahhhs\\".<br /><br />This particular documentary is in my top 5, which warrants the 5 star rating.  It is a tad bit \\"preachy\\" about water over-use and conservation, but you expect that from a documentary.<br /><br />I am determined to do the same river trip as documented in this movie.  After seeing this movie, I added it to my \\"bucket\\" list.<br /><br />This movie is mellow and relaxing, contemplative, visually stunning, and joy to watch again and again.  I wish they spent more time on the actual river rafting, but the ancillary excursions on their trip were fascinating in and of them self.<br /><br />Though I am not a big fan of Dave Mathews, his music was an excellent choice for this movie, and really ties it all together.<br /><br />The \\"must-haves\\" (my opinion only) IMAX documentaries are:<br /><br />o this movie<br />o IMAX Under the sea, narrated by Jim Carey<br />o IMAX Deep Sea or IMAX Ocean Wonderland (lol, I can't remember which one was better)<br />o IMAX Born to be wild (I've seen grown men cry on this one)<br />o IMAX Earth 3D<br /><br />To be skipped<br /><br />o Cave of forgotten dreams (so boring, I couldnt even finish it)<br />o IMAX Space Station<br /><br />And you should get the 3D aquarium one... the cat just loves that one...

Superb acting mixed with great visuals and CGI effects...A-mazing! I was a little confused by the opening scene until I did some research but, the story builds up perfectly to meet the plot of Alien.<br /><br />I recently bought a Samsung 55\\" 3D Smart TV and this will be a great addition to my blu-ray collection! I can't wait to see it again.!

B007DKNEI0|4.0|The actual recordings presented here are among some of my favorites of the era, and somehow still sound like \\"future music\\" even decades after the new electronic frontier they represented has become mainstream. The fact that some albums are split between CDs is not especially annoying to me because the original presentation on LP also had such \\"Side 1/Side 2\\" interruptions. Plus, the inclusion of a single with themes from the \\"Thief\\" soundtrack (Burning Bar and Beach Scene) was a nice solution to an exclusion I can only assume occurred because of licensing issues or a possible soundtrack-only collection.<br />One minor disappointment I had was that the discs came in a normal 5\\" multi-disc plastic jewel case. Though the case is sturdy enough, the somewhat oblong shape of Amazon's item image led me to hope that maybe the boxed set would be more elaborate.

Where are we going?\\"  The three questions posed on the face of Paul Gauguin's masterpiece.<br /><br />Marshalling his knowledge of science, biology, ants (he's the foremost expert in the world), Darwin, and what science has learned in the last 30 years from paleontology,archeology, both physical and cultural anthropology, brain science,<br />climate studies of human effects on the environment, and behavioral studies of animals (especially chimps and bonobos) Dr.Wilson reaches for an answer, or answers.<br /><br />Certainly his answers are controversial.  They are also thought provoking.<br /><br />Quoting from a NY Times review, April 8, 2012 by Jennifer Scheussler:<br /><br />\\"Specifically Dr. Wilson argues that the tendency toward cooperation and collaboration that has powered our spectacular success as a species is explained not by kin selection -- in which evolution favors the genes of individuals who sacrifice themselves for the sake of relatives -- but by group selection, the tendency of evolution to favor groups that work together altruistically, beyond what might be predicted by simple genetic relatedness.\\"<br /><br />This approach by Dr Wilson gets him accused of all sorts of sins,( I use the term deliberately) including Social Darwinism, which some people have historically used to justify all sorts of abuses.  One of the unhappy science types wrote an extremely long rebuttal here on AMAZON (see the negative reviews).<br /><br />Take note of the dissent, if you will.<br /><br />I find this the work of our greatest living scientist, who is revealed also<br />as a fine human being as well as a Humanist in every sense of that word. This book  may not cure your despair, but it is a fine antidote.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Hard to believe this movie is so revered. It's been done. In fact it's a checklist of pretty much every scifi movie ever made...the entire run of this was so nostalgic, from bringing an alien specimen on board (which is always a bad idea, and has a predictable outcome) to the indispensable robot who in the end is the one man for the job.. are people really this forgetful? The casting, other than the Bishop/Aliens ripoff were simply not memorable. I didn't identify with or care about ANY of these characters -- even WITH their names plastered unnecessarily on their heads.<br /><br />Spoilers --<br /><br />Lets not even mention the giant continuity problems like the scientist lady who bares some type of octopus formed alien, then the Borg looking \\"baddie\\" alien (who shares our EXACT DNA so therefore should produce an identical style alien) bares a -- wait for it -- classic alien model just in time for the credits.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily say skip this movie, but you've seen it. It has some impressive visual effects for someone who has never played a modern videogame, but it lacks any sort of soul and the script could definitely use a strong central character..but I suppose when you've cast 9 unlikeable actors - who would you choose?<br /><br />PS - couldn't they find an OLDER actor to play the part of the old man? The \\"old guy\\" visuals looked really poor..and they kept out someone who possibly could have made this film seemed a little more grounded.<br /><br />''Hi---- I'm REALLY OLD. I want to find an alien species because they MUST KNOW how to stop aging -- even though I have no proof they know anything of the kind.. if they even exist AT ALL.\\"<br /><br />''HI, I'm hot and blonde and my dad is 75 years older than I am.\\"<br /><br />did anyone watch the movie -- or just the holographic pretty lights?<br /><br />\\"Hi, I signed up for a mission I didn't know didn't allow guns -- apparently we never discussed the parameters of the mission.\\"

B003Y5H5BA|4.0|In high school, Schmidt and Jenko were polar opposites: the nerd and the jock, natural rivals.  Fast forward a few years, and they become fast friends while going through police academy.  The only problem is, they're lousy cops.  But they're young looking, which makes them perfect candidates for the departmental revival of an 80's undercover program, headquartered at 21 Jump Street.  Their job: infiltrate a local high school, disguised as students, and stop a drug smuggling operation.  However, they both find that high school is not what it used to be.  Hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Surprisingly, 21 JUMP STREET is funny.  In spots, it's absolutely hilarious.  It slowly comes apart in its third act (one particular gag goes a little too far, though it's funny at first), but the first two-thirds are genuinely amusing and occasionally thoughtful.  As Schmidt, Jonah Hill tones down his usual schtick (and his body mass); as Jenko, Channing Tatum is actually hilarious (who knew he could act?!).  The actors' chemistry is undeniable (they're real-life buddies), and helps carry the film.  The supporting cast is equally strong: Dave Franco, Brie Larson, Robb Riggle, and Ice Cube stand out.  And a pair of hilarious cameos helps cap things off.<br /><br />As good as the acting talent is, the real star here is the script.  There's obviously a lot of imrpov, but the script manages to flip high school cliches on their head.  Part of the fun of the film is watching Schmidt and Jenko react to this new high school world; throw in a few high-octane scenes perfectly parodying action films, and you come up with a film that may not be brilliant, but it's at least pretty smart.  If you like hard-R comedies that have some brains behind them, 21 JUMP STREET is right up your dark alley.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter is a masterpiece in cinema. But because of the poor job Disney did marketing it, ignorant critics wrote it off as a rip-off of Star Wars, Avatar, etc. when in truth, the author Edgar Rice Burroughs inspired those with \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and the rest of the Barsooom book series. Disney had a great opportunity to make another successful franchise, and still do, if they are willing to learn from their mistake in not mentioning that John Carter was conceived by the same brilliant mind behind Tarzan. When I saw this in my home-town, an article in the newspaper mentioned that the movie's release date coincided with the 100th anniversary of the publication of A Princess of Mars.  After seeing this film, I was so captivated by it that I researched the author.  Finding that Burroughs wrote a series, not just of John Carter, but was the original creator of Tarzan, got me into reading the series.  It also led me to the works of Ronald E. Howard, author of Conan the Barbarian series, and Solomon Kane. This was the first movie in my life which led me to want to read the books.  Though the movie is a bit different, I have come to expect such from films based on books. I am now on the 6th book of the Barsoom series, and would never have been considering reading it if I had not seen and researched the movie's origins for myself, being instead content to listen to the aforementioned ignorant critics who don't know the difference between a Thern and a Calot. My opinion is that Disney can still recover from this if they market the sequel (which they better make, come Hell or high water) better than previously. But perhaps the ignorance of the general public as to what the movie really was and their blind faith in so called film-experts is also to blame for the small amount of money it made in the US.  TAKE US BACK TO BARSOOM!

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|There is only ONE Fiona Apple, period.  While there are a host of indie-pop/rock singer/songwriters, Fiona is in a league of her own.  Mysterious, artsy, and completely diverse,  2012's [[ASIN:B007VTVGAQ The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do]] presents Apple as creative and independent-minded as ever.  Where 2005's Grammy-nominated [[ASIN:B000B0WOEO Extraordinary Machine]] featured more orchestrations, particularly the title track, The Idler Wheel is more stripped crafting a `less is more' approach.  Despite this, The Idler Wheel is as consistent as its predecessor, even if it yields no commercial single.  That said, aside from \\"Criminal,\\" does one even categorize the enigmatic artist as commercial? Apple continues to showcase her critically-acclaimed artistry on this exceptional album.<br /><br />\\"Every Single Night\\" sets the tone of the effort, with minimal production comprised of celeste, acoustic piano, string bass, and percussion.  Apple's voice is as sultry, commanding, and vulnerable as ever, delivering every nuance with perfection.  The songwriting is top-notch and while \\"Every Single Night\\" is not `commercial' (it is a single), there is enough memorability and artistry within the lyrics to `latch onto' it and plays this cut repeatedly.  Apple doesn't compromise or miss a beat on the equally fine \\"Daredevil,\\" which opens with driving percussion.  Apple's diction is so precise, which adds to the refined nature and dramatic nature of the music.  The instrumental ideas capture here are solid and clever.  Most notably is the malicious treatment of the refrain: \\"...Don't let me ruin me/I may need a chaperone.\\"  Apple goes two for two early on.<br /><br />\\"Valentine\\" slackens the tempo, but doesn't slack up on momentum.  The cut opens with subtle thudding kick drum and piano chords giving way to bluesy-balladry.  Apple's vocals are sensitive to convey the mood.  On the refrain, ever unpredictable, Apple speeds the tempo up in which she sings: \\"I'm a tulip in a cup/I stand no chance of growing up/I've made my peace I'm dead, I'm done/I watched you live to have my fun...\\" On the superb \\"Jonathan,\\" Apple and company open up with an extended instrumental introduction.  The harmonic progression is classically-driven and is livened by interactive drums via tom tom runs.  Apple vocally sounds smoky, mysterious, and continues to deliver precise, excellent diction.<br /><br />\\"Left Alone\\" opens with pummeling tom drums, establishing a gargantuan rhythmic presence from the onset.  An excellent, though oddball piano ostinato characterizes here; overall, a jazzy sound describes the cut.  Creative and different from anything else in the music industry, \\"Left Alone\\" serves as another piece of the excellent Idler Wheel.  \\"Werewolf\\" has a six-feel about it, opening with rhythmic, lilting piano.  Apple's vocals are strong and full-bodied, affirming her genuineness as a singer/songwriter.  The refrain stands out as Apple sings: \\"But you were such a super guy til the second you got a whiff of me/we are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity...nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key...\\"<br /><br />\\"Periphery\\" finds Apple focuses on the lower register of the piano, a mainstay and characteristic of Apple's writing/approach.  \\"Periphery\\" possesses a `tongue-in-cheek,' novelty quality about it.  On \\"Regret,\\" Apple turns manic, particularly on the refrain in which she sings: \\"I ran out of white dove feathers/to soak up the hot p--- that comes through your mouth/every time you address me...\\" Minimalist, tasteful, and well produced, \\"Regret\\" is one of my favorites.<br />\\"Anything We Want\\" continues the overt consistency of Idler Wheel while \\"Hot Knife\\" closes the effort nearly, if not as strongly as it opens.  The layered vocals on this cut are a nice touch for sure.<br /><br />There is little if nothing to quibble about [[ASIN:B007VTVGAQ The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do]] ; it is Fiona at her most authentic and best.  Moody, cerebral, and creative, The Idler Wheel is easily one of 2012's best efforts and continues to find Apple growing more and more creative as time goes on. Excellence epitomized.er Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do]] ; it is Fiona at her most authentic and best.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|For those who think Evernote is invasive: all of its permissions are required for the functionality that makes Evernote so great.  Access to coarse location is needed so you can look up notes by location of creation.  Access to your contacts is so you can directly insert one into your note.  Unfortunately, though, it seems that the app is the general Android version (The Kindle Fire runs on Android, for those that don't know), so some permissions are unnecessary (such as access to the vibration feature, read only access to phone state, and access to fine location), but they can't invade your privacy if you are using the Kindle Fire, and they are needed for functionality if you are using an Android device that supports these above features (although I haven't been able to find out what read only access to phone state is used for).<br /><br />Evernote is a great app for not only notes, but also photo storage, recipe catalouging, file backup, file delivering, etc.

It is very easy to read and understand and is designed for the average person who may not have taken any macroeconomics classes in their lives.
0553801503|2.0|It's a shame George Martin felt the need to pad his previously wonderful creation with needless characters, stagnant plotting, infantile interior monologue and pointless sadism. In the previous books I felt as if MOST of the violence was justified (Jaimie getting his hand amputated, Stark losing his head, Tywin taking a crossbow bolt in the yarbles), but Book 4 left me legitimately wondering about Martin's mental health. How many loving descriptions of rapes, multilations and executions and rotting bodies should one reader suffer through? A character isn't just assaulted, she has her breasts hacked off. Two people don't just fight, one has her cheeks ripped off in cannibalistic fury. One character is served his own roasted body parts and Martin delights in describing the grease from his own flesh dripping down his mustache as he gobbles them up. You need help, Georgie boy. How did Tolkien manage thousands of pages describing a violent medieval world without umpteen references to crows eating cheeks? Bleakness for the sake of bleakness. I know Martin can do better because he DOES do better within the very same book. He includes kind and loving descriptions of Aemon Targaryen's last days and Samwell's affection for the old maester. Jaime actually shows some moral development, becoming a new and improved Lannister. So one can't abandon all hope for Martin. I have to conclude there was no artistic reason to pad this series to 7 books when Book 4 (and Book 5 if some reviews are to be believed) contain so little plot development and plentiful padding designed only to enrich his publishing bottom line.

0061020710|4.0|The Color of Magic, published in 1983, is the first book in Sir Terry Pratchett's enormously popular DISCWORLD series. The Disworld is a flat world which rides on the back of four elephants which ride on the back of a giant turtle named Great A'Tuin. The DISCWORLD novels are humorous, satirical and spoofy, often making fun of their own genre and various real-world cultural and political issues and institutions. Before HARRY POTTER, Terry Pratchett was the UK's top selling author.<br /><br />The Color of Magic introduces Rincewind who is technically a wizard because one dangerous spell attached itself to his brain when Rincewind opened a forbidden book. Rincewind doesn't know what the spell does or how to cast it, and he doesn't remember any of the other things he was supposed to learn at the Unseen University but, nonetheless, he's a wizard. He's also a coward -- a really lucky coward because, though he's unaware of it, Lady Luck is his patron.<br /><br />One day Twoflower, a rich insurance salesman from a far-off land, comes to Ankh-Morpor to vacation and asks Rincewind to show him around because Rincewind is the only person who can speak his language. Twoflower is curious, fearless, and completely ignorant of the dangers in Ankh-Morpor. Rincewind tries to safely show him the sights, but the two of them end up needing to escape from one disaster after another. During their adventures we meet a barbarian hero who loves to pose for pictures, fratricidal dragonlords with unpronounceable names (K!sdra and Lio!rt), dryads, a troll from another world, a tentacled monster who lives in a temple in which everything is octagonal but you may not say the word \\"eight,\\" a terrorist on an airplane, a drowning frog, and a group of scientifically-minded wizards who want to push somebody off the edge of the world.<br /><br />The Color of Magic is non-stop quirky adventure with lots of laughs. Pratchett's British humor is silly, clever and witty and it's fun to see him salute, and sometimes mock, well-known fantasy works, characters, or clich&eacute;s. I think I recognized Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Conan the Barbarian, and Red Sonja. In this first DISCWORD novel, transitions between scenes are a bit rough and sometimes the humor tries too hard, but Terry Pratchett's genius is clearly visible. The DISCWORD books are fun stand-alone reads that make a great break from heavier works.<br /><br />I listened to the 1995 audio production by ISIS Audio Books. This is not the clearest of productions -- there is a noticeable background hum (you can hear it on the sample at Amazon or Audible). However, Nigel Planer's narration was so brilliant that I will be listening to the rest of the DISCWORD audiobooks that he narrates. I loved his interpretation of all of Pratchett's characters.

B0040QYROA|5.0|\\"Metropolis\\" is presented here with extra footage that was long considered forever lost; we also get the original Gottfried Huppertz musical score. The plot progresses at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The musical score enhances the film and although some of the acting is a bit overdone it doesn't lessen the quality of the movie. The casting was well done and I was impressed with the special effects some of which were rather advanced at the time.<br /><br />Metropolis is a giant, highly sophisticated Utopian city in the far-off future (well, considering that it was made in 1927 the far-off future is the year 2026); the wealthy elite living there have access to education, theaters, beautiful gardens and stadiums so they can enjoy a splendid, privileged exisistance. However, there is a dark side to this--the city was built and is being maintained by nameless workers all wearing dark uniforms or just rags deep beneath the ground; most of them lack names, one of them is simply called \\"11811\\" (Erwin Biswanger) and few of the elite are even aware of this! The city's master and director is Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) who employs Josaphat (Theodor Loos) and \\"The Thin Man\\" (Fritz Rasp) who also spies for him. There is also the inventor Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) to whom Joh Fredersen goes whenever his \\"experts fail him;\\" and Joh has a son named Freder (Gustav Fr&ouml;hlich) who is not responsible for managing the Utopian city.<br /><br />One day, Freder is in the special gardens of Metropolis when a mysterious, beautiful woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) appears with many children of the workers from deep down below. Freder instantly falls in love with her. Before Freder can speak with Maria, however, she and the children go away--but not before Maria tells the children (and, indirectly, the elite) that they should look upon their \\"brothers.\\" Freder goes below the city to follow Maria and he is horrified to discover the terrible struggle of the workers who must toil in nonstop 10 hour shifts, their heads bent down in submission as they march to work and leave work. Freder changes places with worker number 11811 and he pursues Maria until he finds her preaching for peace and promising the workers that a mediator representing a \\"heart\\" will come to join the \\"head\\" and the \\"hand\\"--management and worker--so that workers can have a better existence.<br /><br />Add to this a rivalry between Joh and Rotwang for Joh's late wife Hel; Rotwang's drive for revenge against Joh for past wrongdoings and fights pitting Freder against both his father and Rotwang for the fate of the workers and Maria and you have a motion picture full of action, suspense and more! Look also for what happens when Rotwang uses Maria to make a robotic clone of her; and Heinrich George turns in a fine performance as Grot, Guardian of the Heart Machine. Of course, the extra footage adds to the cohesiveness of the plot.<br /><br />There's more I could tell you but I don't want to spoil it all for you. Suffice it to say that it's all quite memorable.<br /><br />As for the extra features, I particularly enjoyed the documentary on the making and restoration of the film.<br /><br />\\"Metropolis\\" is one of the best German silent films; it's also one of the best silent films ever.

I don't know what Cd's one of the reviewers was commenting on before Surreal but both Tales from the Beach and Transatlantic were in my opinion off the chain. Incognito is truly one of the best bands in the industry. Bluey gift is truly that a gift and that's from God. I can hear all of the music I grew-up listing to in Incognito plus more. Surreal is just that fantastic. I am waiting to hear my favorite band live in L.A., soon I hope. I just don't want to give all the credit to Jean-Paul the whole band is kicking Natalie, Matthew, Alexei, Mo, Francis, Dominic, Richard, Jamie, Trevor and P.J. just to name a few.<br /> TW

0345529057|3.0|This is a cheap printing in every sense; my copy is mostly fine, but has many typos, a number of printing smudges, and the binding is weak. You get what you pay for, I suppose. Three stars for the physical printing.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I've read in quite a long time. Despite its length, I happily lost myself in it, cover to cover. A Clash of Kings continues the story in fine form, hopping between the many plot threads, and introducing intriguing new characters and plenty of twists. Sadly, that's where the series loses its footing. A Storm of Swords starts with some promise, but quickly loses focus--and then becomes a strange mixture, where some parts are excellent, but just as many are uninteresting, a few are deeply disappointing, and a few are grindingly dull. I won't say more except that by the end of the book, I was wondering why I was bothering to continue reading. Sadly, A Feast for Crows fits its title too well--it is the tedious dregs of a once-absorbing epic. Most of the action happens out of scene, and that which is presented directly is consistently boring. I continued reading to the end of the book driven by the hope that it would somehow find its way, but it never did. Five stars for A Game of Thrones, sliding down to two stars for A Feast for Crows.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is an exciting read that delves into the darkness of the occult while delivering a new twist on the entire paranormal myth of vampires, shapeshifters, witches and the like.<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton's writing has any easy flow, and her characters are so well written and developed. I loved that the characters took their time to explore their feelings of love before diving head-first into a relationship that seemed doomed from the beginning. Sophia and Charles are perfect together, even with their differences. They have this beautiful way of communicating with each other without even using words and that alone spoke volumes about the feelings they shared for each other. At times tense, at times so easy, their love felt real.<br /><br />The idea of vampires and other paranormal beings having been sent by the Universe for one purpose or another was fascinating. And their attachment to the elements was so unique. Throughout the book we are introduced to the Cruor (Earth elementals) - much like the vampires we have all grown to love, Witches (Spirit elementals), Strigoi (Water elementals) or shapeshifters, Chibold (Fire elementals) or child-like sprites, and finally the Ankou (Air elementals) or grim reapers. It was exciting to be introduced to their world and to get a glimpse at why each was created.<br /><br />But this book isn't only about paranormals. It is about friendship, loyalty and even betrayal. The story was in no way predictable, and there were a few shocking moments which jumped out at me from nowhere.<br /><br />Although the story focuses on the MC and her issues, it was interesting to view the history of a particular minor character, through visionary flashbacks, which culminated in the explination and reasoning for what was happening to Sophia. And again, the idea of the \\"Forever Girls\\" was so imaginative and fresh.<br /><br />This story will surely satisfy its readers every desire!!

034580404X|4.0|I've gotten into countless debates with friends, coworkers, people in my gym, and even random women at the grocery store about the Fifty Shades Trilogy. It always starts with the same uneasy question, \\"Have you read Fifty Shades?\\" and then depending on the group, either downcast eyes as women are embarrassed to admit to their sins or full eye contact in more of a \\"are you woman enough to handle it?\\" challenge. After people haltingly admit to reading the book (70% of the women I know have) or claim innocence, then comes the first full round of questions - what did they think of it? Can they admit to liking it? Was it too risque or not hard core enough for them? And as we either stammer our appreciation or brazenly declare that it was too tame - now comes the big debate - what did you think of it overall? Would you recommend it?<br /><br />Two main camps here: the \\"I loved it kind of like I love Justin Bieber but won't admit it\\" or the \\"I'm too cool for it because I only read Joyce or Austen.\\" Here's the deal ladies - it's great - if you're reading for the sex and this isn't your normal genre of fiction. I have heard the complaint from some ladies that regularly read erotic fiction that this is boring. My mom actually used to read the grocery store books with Fabio on the cover (and now knowing what's in them, it kind of makes me gag a little), but I never have. So Fifty Shades for me was really fun and parts of it were pretty hot. And the person that had the most fun through this trilogy was likely my husband. He got to reap all of the benefits of a particularly juicy page or two.<br /><br />I read a lot of contemporary fiction. So would I say that Fifty Shades is well written? Absolutely not. But just as I don't like Bieber's \\"Boyfriend\\" because of its lyrical depth or complex harmonies, I don't like the Fifty Shades series because its Pulitzer prize winning material. I like it for the romance between an impossible hero and heroine, the intensity of their relationship, and the sex. There, I said it. You can too. Yes, it gets a little tired by book three, but overall, it's a super easy and fun read.

0345803485|4.0|I am not one to bash creative efforts. But this trilogy is the product for the same America that craves shows like Real Housewives. It does not have a lot of literary merit. Developed plot? Nah. Does it have complex characters? Nope. It's as if you put a James Bond, Hustler, and a Danielle Steele novel into a blender and this is what came out. However, if you are a bored housewive, like myself, who is looking for something simple and naughty to read, this is the dallop of whip cream you are looking for.
B0053O89KG|3.0|At the end of season three, there was a Big Reveal. This season spends most of its time pretending that never happened, and essentially recycles the Big Reveal. You could watch seasons 1, 2, 3, and 5 when it comes out without missing any story.<br />That, to me, makes this season garbage. I absolutely love the show and the characters (when they are acting in character), and have been enjoying the show until this season. I have high hopes that next season will make up for it.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Linkin Park has reached a point in their careers in which they have created a catalog of music that is so stylistically diverse and collected a fan base that is equally diverse that no matter what they release they are going to have half of their fans loving it and half of their fans hating it.<br /><br />There are two main camps of Linkin Park fans. The first group, who often refer to themselves as \\"true\\" Linkin Park fans for some unknown reason, are those nu metal fans that think Hybrid Theory and Meteora were the greatest albums ever and think that every album that the band releases should sound like those two albums and every song should make them want to put on a white wifebeater and punch people in the face. These people do not like Minutes to Midnight or A Thousand Suns... the songs on those albums are not good punching songs.<br /><br />The other camp of Linkin Park fans are real music fans who do not mind music that makes you think, rather than just rage, and enjoy having their favorite bands grow and get better through time. Don't get us wrong (I'm using \\"us\\" because I'm including myself in this group), we loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but we don't want the band to keep releasing the same albums over and over again. We like where the band went on Minutes to Midnight and A Thousands Suns [feel free to check out my review of A Thousand Suns]. I would actually argue that we are the \\"true\\" Linkin Park fans, as we have grown with the band and have accepted and appreciated each subsequent album instead of dismissing the band because they've changed.<br /><br />Here's the problem. The first group wants the band to release Hybrid Theory again. The second group wants the band to build off of A Thousand Suns and continue to explore new ground. There is no way for the band to release an album that is going to satisfy both of those camps. On Living Things, it sounds like Linkin Park attempted to do just that. Not surprisingly, it doesn't work.<br /><br />Living Things almost feels like two EPs on one CD. The first half of the album generally sounds like they attempted to recreate what they did on Meteora. They even threw in a couple heavy angry white boy songs like \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" and \\"Victimized\\" that will make Joe Wifebeater happy [\\"Finally, I can punch again!\\"]. \\"Lost In the Echo\\" and \\"In My Remains\\" sound like they would fit in well on Meteora. \\"Burn it Down\\" sounds as though the band was hoping for a fourth Transformers movie. \\"I'll Be Gone\\" is an excellent song, but sounds like it could've been on Minutes to Midnight. The second half of the album generally displays elements of the more recent sound the band has explored on parts of Minutes and on A Thousand Suns. \\"Castle of Glass\\" is a high point on the album and sounds very similar to their sound on A Thousand Suns. \\"Roads Untraveled\\" is great ballad-esque song, and probably my favorite song on the album. \\"Skin to Bone\\" is a very interesting sounding song, musically, and another high point on the album. \\"Until it Breaks\\" mixes a lot of styles together into multiple parts in one song, and sounds like it could've been somewhere on A Thousand Suns, it just doesn't sound as inspired as anything on A Thousand Suns did. \\"Tinfoil\\" is a transition to \\"Powerless,\\" which is another very good song with a power ballad feel (or at least Linkin Park's version of a power ballad), and a good ending to the album.<br /><br />The nu metal fans that were hoping for Hybrid Theory 2.0 will most likely enjoy about half of this album and quickly dismiss the rest of it.<br /><br />I think that overall, Living Things is a good album, but I'm disappointed in the band because I view this as a step backward for a band that has grown and gotten better on every album up until this point.<br /><br />The songs on this album are, for the most part, good; most of them will find their way onto my mp3 player, and when they play on random I will turn up the volume and enjoy them. The album as a whole,however, just feels like a band that is attempting to appease their fans rather than write what they want to write. The songs are short, less than inspired in some cases, and sound a lot like what they've done in the past. The good news is that no matter what kind of fan you are, you'll find something on here that you'll like. The bad news is that no matter what kind of fan you are, you'll also find something on here that you won't like.however, just feels like a band that is attempting to appease their fans rather than write what they want to write.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building Your Book for Kindle made quick and easy work of the formatting process.  In just a couple of hours I was able to prepare the manuscript for my e-book [[ASIN:B008CR4RYS Spirit of '76]] and a short time after that I was eagerly (A.K.A nervously) submitting by book for actual publication.

B005LAIH54|4.0|This movie is entertaining, fun to watch, interesting and engaging.  The special effects are outstanding.  The numerous monsters and creatures really seem alive and present in the scenes.  There are fabulous scenes of  temples, moving mazes, and lots and lots of creatures.  The black Pegasus is back, better than ever.  (there is one marvelous scene, where an annoyed Pegasus smacks Perseus with his wing)  There is action and excitement and heroics.  The movie does not suffer from the darkness that \\"Clash of the Titans\\" had, which made many scenes hard to make out.  What it does have in common with the first movie, is the choice of colors. Really,  if you are going to film in color, how about you use, well,  some COLORS!  The entire movie is filmed in sepia tints, with only the blue sky and sea to break up the browns, rusts, sands, beiges, and blacks.  Still for all of that, the movie is well worth watching and buying.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert----Just so you know, I am going to mention specifics of the movie, what I liked and didn't, and what I thought, so if you don't like to read that kind of thing, stop here.<br /><br />The movie begins in the twilight of the gods of Olympus.  Apparently following several years after the first film, \\"Clash of the Titans\\",  the human race has continued to lose faith in the gods and to turn from worshipping them.  The gods have depended for so long on the strength given them by the faith of humans that they are all losing their powers.  The most immediate threat caused by this is that the barriers between earth and Tartarus are breaking down.  All the demons and monsters imprisoned there are escaping to rampage in the human world.  And if Kronos, the monstrous father of the elder gods, (Zeus, Hades and Poseidon) should escape, all of creation will be destroyed.<br /><br />Zeus, Poseidon and Aries go to Hades realm to confront Kronos, only to be met with treachery and death.  Zeus is captured and Poseidon mortally wounded. The other,younger gods (Apollo, Aphrodite, etc.) are all conspicuous by their absence.  This is one of the places were I wished the movie had been longer and with more detail.  Hades delivers a one line explanation that, like him, the other gods will live if they support Kronos.  This really doesn't hang together.  All the younger gods, and numerous demi-gods, all decided to run and hide, and trust their fates to Kronos?  Doesn't really track.  And if they did, wouldn't Zeus and Poseidon have noticed something wrong?  Are the younger gods already dead, or so weak that they cannot offer any support?  Nothing about them is really mentioned.  In fact, why did Zeus travel to Tartarus with so little backup?  Sure, Poseidon and Zeus are the most powerful of the gods, and maybe this is a case of hubris on their part.  And a fatal error, as they do not suspect treachery of Hades and Aries, and underestimate how much their powers have been weakened.<br /><br />The gods seem terribly human here.  I found the scenes between Zeus and Hades very touching.  There is guilt and forgiveness on both sides.  Hades' greatest fear is very telling: humans have immortal souls, that pass on after the death of their mortal bodies---but what about the gods?  Do they have souls as well, that will continue, or do they simply fade into oblivion if they should die?  A truly human fear, and an interesting thought.  Humans have their many religions and faiths to turn to in times of trial---but what of the gods?  If you are a god, and your power fails you, where do you turn for succor, if you believe in nothing greater than yourself?<br /><br />And the god Aries?  His weaknesses are truly human.  How sad it is that Aries, powerful, immortal god of war, is jealous of his half brother, Perseus.  Perseus, who has no godly power, who is not immortal, who lives in a hut and works as a poor fisherman, lucky if he has enough to eat day to day?  You would think that Perseus would be beneath Aries' notice, but Ariesis jealous because he thinks that Zeus loves Perseus more than Aries himself.  And he has allowed his bitterness to fester into unreasoning hatred. He is so fixated on hurting both Zeus and Perseus that he does not care about anything else.  And so he makes a devil's bargain with Kronos.  Supposedly Kronos has promised Hades and Aries their immortal lives, if they free him.  Both ally themselves with Kronos out of their weaknesses: Hades out of his fear of perishing forever,  Aries out of his hatred and jealousy.  And neither one of them are using their heads----when Kronos is free, why should he keep his bargains with anyone? Zeus tries to warn the pair, to no avail.<br /><br />Poseidon lives long enough to give warning to Perseus,  setting off the action for the rest of the story.  Interestingly enough, he sends Perseus to find his own half human son.  The two demi-gods ally themselves and set off to rescue Zeus and stop Kronos.<br />There are some great scenes between them, although I would have liked to see more.  The passing of the gods is very well done---they crumble to ash, leaving nothing behind.<br /><br />Liam Neeson does a wonderful job as the god Zeus, making the character regal, godly, but loving and human as well.  I am very pleased that Mr. Neeson has finally been getting the appreciation from the public that he deserves.  He appears in more movies, in better roles and with far better acting than half the so called \\"super-stars\\" of today combined.  Neeson makes the character of Zeus seem alive, both noble and human, with faults and strengths. In Greek and  Roman mythology, none of the gods were particularly noble or admirable characters, much less people who's passing you would mourn. But Liam Neeson gives Zeus all those qualities.  He has some short but truly fine scenes with Hades,  where both of the brothers ask for, and grant, forgiveness to each other.  Hades seems far less the monster than he was in the last movie. Hades realizes that he has been controlled by his fear, and has a \\"What have I done?!\\" moment.  Faced with their final ends, both gods forgive their offences against each other, and remember their loving bonds as brothers.  I loved the scenes where both godly brothers go to war against Kronos to save the world and the human race, even though they both know the probable consequence for that action. Between them, and Perseus, Kronos is destroyed and earth is saved.<br /><br />Zeus is killed, living only long enough to give a loving farewell to Perseus.  I really objected to this part of the story, although it is very dramatic.  I really thought that Hades should have been killed,  and Zeus should have survived to rebuild Olympus.  Although perhaps this was really a better punishment for Hades, as his godly powers are now mostly gone, and he may have only a short time to live.  He must face his worst fear, all alone.<br /><br />I, for one, do not believe that the gods had no souls.  No beings capable of such depths of feeling, of such great deeds, of such great hopes, could be bereft of immortal souls.  So rest in peace Zeus. And Poseidon, and yes, Hades as well.  You all did well.<br /><br />And they left the race of man behind them. Just as flawed, but just as capable of  greatness.  And perhaps we are better for it, because our accomplishments take so much more effort.<br /><br />In a way, the ending of this movie reminded me slightly of the end of the story \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  The end of both stories see the beginning of the reign of man, and the end of all things of magic.  With the gods gone,  we have to assume that all the wonders (like Pegasus) and terrors (monsters, demons) will slowly fade away, leaving man in sole possession of the world. The torch is passed, from Zeus to Perseus, to his son, Helios.  The gods have gone, but left the half-gods, like Perseus, behind.  And they are more human than not.<br /><br />This movie was fun, a good watching experience.  I would recommend it.

B007KOMTUI|3.0|I LOVE Mad Men seasons 1-4. Season 5 was just full of unnecessary filler. I will tell you the reasons I LOVE Mad Men and they are Don, Joan, Peggy, Roger, Sally and yes even Betty. But this Season strayed from the core/strong/awesome characters to show more of Lane (who I thought was a temp addition from the start), Megan (we never thought there would be a character more annoying then Betty, then Megan came along), and skeezy Pete (who I could care less about). There are definitely stand out episodes from Season 5 that were mostly enjoyable, but I do agree with a lot of reviews that this is a watered-downed season. I hope that we see more of our favorite characters in Season 6. But knowing Matt Weiner, we will just have to make due with what he decides to give us...
B001TWT0AE|5.0|This is a story about truth vs. mythology and about the losses and gains which come from civilization.  There is a unique blend of realism and legend in the story and cinematography.  I've hardly ever seen such a crisply told story, whose plot elements all converge on a single incident so powerfully.  That incident, the showdown in which the terrorizing outlaw Liberty Valance dies, is very exciting because Jimmy Stewart's character has been bringing education and optimism to the community, and Liberty Valance, an out-of-control outlaw, demonstrates the nature of evil by his desire to kill Stewart even if the whole community gets plunged back into chaos.  Adding tension is a love triangle between John Wayne, Vera Miles, and Jimmy Stewart.  (I found myself sympathizing with Stewart completely, because Wayne's character is pretty rude, but the special features said director John Ford sympathized more with Wayne.)  Wayne and Stewart have an unusual combination of rivalry and respect in their relationship.  But what sticks most with me about this movie is the experience of seeing all the good Jimmy Stewart brings to the community and how Liberty nearly destroys that, especially by his violence to the reporter right before the showdown and the enjoyment he gets from scaring Stewart at the showdown.  A VERY ENGAGING MOVIE.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Billy Beane has a problem.  As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox.  To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got.  Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a  23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook.  The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.<br /><br />Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, \\"Moneyball\\" provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball.  In many ways, \\"Moneyball\\" is a kind of grownup version of \\"The Bad News Bears\\" and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A`s won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs).  Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games).  The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clich&eacute;s inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again.  The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.<br /><br />Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, \\"Moneyball\\" is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games.  A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams.  Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team.  Chris Pratt (\\"Everwood,\\" \\"Parks and Recreation\\") and Kerris Dorsey (\\"Parenthood\\") also score in small but important roles.<br /><br />There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A`s into the record books.  But \\"Moneyball\\" never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side.  In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.ow manages to make seem fresh and vital again.

In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Every single image has so much going on in it, because it's... his way of making the best possible movie he can. I don't get how the haters say that this is worse than the original trilogy, can't they see that each scene is like poetry, you know, they rhyme.<br /><br />If people are complaining about some of the later scenes what they don't understand about this CGI Mona Lisa is that it's stylistically designed to be that way, and while we can't change any of that we can diminish the effects, although I think George may have gone too far in a few places.<br /><br />And for all you dumb Jar-Jar Binks Haterz, he's the key to all of this, because he's a funnier character, than Star Wars has ever had.<br /><br />So if you're on the fence onto whether or not you should watch this CGI gold, just know that it'll be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|No, its not a literary work of art. It's often repetitive in description, no true character development and burdened with a predictable plot. However, with that said, if you can release yourself from the expectations of fine writing, then yep, its entertaining. It panders to two certain methods for grabbing the female audience, 1. Fawning, if not cloying, adoration from a wealthy sex-driven stud, albeit an emotionally adrift one, and 2. more fawning by same said stud, with a truckload of sex and drama thrown in.<br /><br />Just go with the flow and enjoy it for what it worth...
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|great game but you need to use the dialogue boxes to figure it out in the beginning.<br />wish there were directions .... I don't enjoy figuring it out... however I did and liked it.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|enjoy playing these just to pass time can be very addicting I playing the evening when I have nothing else to do its a great free app.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|the game starts out pretty boring. the dialouge makes it fun more interesting as you go along. the thing about most seek and find games is that they are only fun the first time because there is only one possible outcome. I wish there graphics were a little better.
0307593312|5.0|What a truly bizarre and yet beautifully written book (originally a three volume set written in Japanese). 1Q84 is a masterfully told tale of two worlds; one, the real world of 1984 and another version tagged \\"1Q84\\" by one of the protagonist, Aomame, as she realizes she's no longer functioning in the \\"real\\" world, but life has somehow blurred and merged with a slightly altered version...a version existing with two moons.<br /><br />So much happens in this trilogy compilation, told from multiple storylines and interesting points of view that all ultimately and seamlessly intertwine into one epic tale. As such, I won't even attempt to go into the rest of the elaborate plot; or more accurately stated the numerous concurrent side plots. Sound complicated?...Well, yeah it is, very much so actually and with plenty of curious supernatural twist, unexpected turns and overlapping connections (the phrase \\"six degrees of separation\\" comes to mind), making Murakami's long read, 1Q84, all the more captivating and definitely worth the time and mental investment.<br /><br />Although this was my first Haruki Murakami book, I have to say I enjoyed the Japanese author's exquisitely strange and creative writing so much, that upon finishing 1Q84, I immediately ordered another of his prominent works (THE WINDUP BIRD CHRONICLE) and look forward to further experiencing his talented skilled pen in storytelling.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|No longer a fan of their new stuff. Just makes me think of tracks they did for the Transformer movies. I miss the Meteora days.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a really good version of solitaire.  I wish there were more options to it but for what they have its a good application.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I usually don't play regular solitaire because I found it difficult.  This game however is very .easy and I enjoy playing it

B007T2XC7A|4.0|Picked up this album via an Amazon special. It was totally worth it. I love Norah Jones and I think she did a great job with this album.
034580404X|1.0|If you liked Twilight, you'll love this series.<br />The plot is paper thin. The writing itself is horrific.<br />Anastasia Steele is just as completely lame as Bella Swan.. LITERALLY falling into the pristine, stark office of the world's most eligible bachelor.<br />And Christian Grey is just as ridiculous as Edward Cullen. Apparently rich, handsome men have a penchant for scraggly converse-wearing tomboys?<br />Makes perfect sense.<br /><br />My friends and I made a drinking game out of this novel.<br />1. Take a shot every time the word \\"vagina\\" is avoided.<br />2.<br />3.<br />4.<br />5. Drunk.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this book is byfar the best action/romance (at least i think thats what it is) book i have ever read. ending didnt go the way i wanted it to but still. a very good book. VERY good book. 5 stars without a doubt
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I, like many others, had worries about what Florence & The Machine would deliver for her sophomore album. Especially since \\"Lungs\\", while absolutely stunning, didn't really have a sense of direction or theme. There were some tracks that I loved and some tracks that I couldn't listen all the way through. However, the same can't be the said with \\"Ceremonials\\".<br /><br />What I love about this album is while it has this album has this theme of creating overwhelming music, it's not repetitive at all. Each track dabbles in its own genres and has its own distinctive sound. It's the result that is the same. She takes everything to the extreme: her voice, the sweeping orchestra in the background, the cryptic lyrics. All of it.<br /><br />Another thing I really appreciate about Florence is that the whole album has consistently great quality. She also has this talent of writing some really catchy melodies without being completely mainstream (I couldn't see some of the songs, though amazing, being played on the radio). Good examples of this are \\"Never Let Me Go\\", \\"Spectrum\\", \\"Shake It Out\\", \\"What the Water Gave Me\\", etc.<br /><br />This album does have a few negative things that may make people dislike it. First is that the album, overall, has a very dark tone. Secondly, the album isn't that experimental, and is a highly polished record. Lastly, this overwhelming theme is never toned down for the whole album. This is NOT a laid-back record. It's Florence to the Extreme (see what I did there?).<br /><br />However, for me, those are all good things. I appreciate the dark tone and I like that she took the time to polish the record. The final products were much better than the demos, in my opinion. And most importantly, I LOVE Florence to the Extreme. Rarely does music overwhelm me, except with disappointment. In this age of manufactured pop stars and sex-craving rappers, we really need Florence. All the emotions and nuances and personal lyrics are what make this album so specialand one of the best albums of 2011.<br /><br />And quickly, my favorite song: Only If For a Night (and the rest of the record follows right behind, besides the next two I list)<br />Least favorite songs: Remain Nameless (from the deluxe)<br />\\"All This and Heaven Too\\" (from the regular edition)<br /><br />I look forward to the next album! Get this album if you haven't already!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|so adicting!! I love it and can't. stop playing it.  I like the variety of the puzzles.  so glad I found it
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|....decent time waster! I think it is relatively fun, and decently difficult. Curious to see what comes from them next.
B00011KHTM|1.0|The images on this page and the technical details all indicate that this will be an Apple brand, retail packaged  VGA adaptor. I received a cheaply made knockoff product that I am returning for refund. I would not trust showing up at a week long conference with a knockoff product and will get one directly from Apple where I can be assured of its reliability.

B0086700CM|5.0|It was interesting to see how fast the younger kids catch on. something that I thoroughly enjoy as well. one can certainly kill some time.
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|I just got it and tried it out. It's not great but should work as a quiet practice amp.  You have to diddle with the gain and volume controls to get an almost realistic sound.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Having lots of fun with this well designed game. Hidden object games would seem to be so simple. But if so, why do we spend so much time on them?
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|I couldn't get into the movie, it's a historical thing so yes he dies and I knew that before watching the movie.  The guy didn't know what he was doing \\"Striking out on his own.\\"  He had a book of plants and thought he could survive in Alaska.  Yeah tell that to the natives who spent thousands of years perfecting thier Alaskian existance. OK so he wants to get away from civilation for various reasons.  So do many of us, but we have common sense not to strike out alone in the Alaskian wilderness. He's lucky he found that bus or he would have died much, much sooner.  Honestly I felt bad for the moose, it's life was wasted trying to keep his dumba$$ alive.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I am recovering from surgery.  I spent all day looking for the items.  If you enjoy &quot;I Spy &quot; books,  you will enjoy this.  I wish there were more explaination as to how I am suppose to align crystals in the minigames!<br /><br />If your shoulders get all tense and tight hoping Om Nom will get that candy,  this is much more relaxing!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love these books, I have read all three of them and cannot wait to see the movies. Even though I am an old lady I really enjoyed these books. They were had to not read in one sitting. Kept you guessing what would happen next.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Fun object search game. Lots of levels and mini games. Excellent as a FAOTD. Don't think I would pay full price though.
0307200477|5.0|Ordered this book for a friends future baby since it was one of my child's favorites and when I recieved it it was a larger bigger book with more pages then the small one that we had recieved for our shower.  I was so jealous I ended up ordering another one of the same kind for my own daughter.  Item was shipped and recieved in great condition.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very good, but can run slow every now and then. It doens't run perfectly like it does on apple devices. it is jittery and doesn't register some swipes for moves sometimes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has all the good translations, easy to use, excellent reading plans, and is great for personal Bible study.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you're bored and looking for a fun reflex game this is great! ! This game is very entertaining with a lot of different levels.

030758836X|4.0|Let's see... (this could be a bit spoilery)<br /><br />I hated all of the characters.<br />I hated what happened in the story.<br />I hated what happened at the end.<br /><br />Great book!<br /><br />Seriously, it was certainly different to read a book with no heroes and no happy endings... and really you don't even wish for a winner.  Does it make it a bad book?  No way!  It was a great, albeit stressful read.  LOL!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|you do not have to log onto facebook - I did whole game facebook free,  just don 't hit the tap here spot when you finish a level and it won't ask you!!  I personally hate the searches with the silohettes of the object - but overall the hidden picture part fun. the mini games were okay but the one where you had to untangle the lines / crystals made no sense to me and there were no directions / help to give you a clue - I would &quot;try &quot; a few times, sometimes getting it,  sometimes just skipping the game... glad that it had the skip function. overall easy to play,  it did freeze up my kindle once but had no other trouble - good time waster!!
0545323126|5.0|Received books as described, very fast and accurate. Perfect for my kids summer reading. This is a good series for 8 years and up.

B005F96URI|1.0|This movie has earned a place of honor in my lists of movies.  It did to me what no other movie has done in over 20 years:  it made me not finish it.  I have seen plenty of bad movies (Avatar, Order, Practical Magic) but with those I was at least able to sit through them in their entirety (I think I deserve an award for sitting through \\"Avatar\\", but that's just me).  This one I couldn't.<br /><br />Set in a post-apocalyptic world where guns are banned, Drifter (is that his name or were the writers just unable to think of one?) and non-violent samurai Yoshi (yeah, wrap your head around that one, but don't worry, his vow lasts less than 5 minutes) show up in a town run by a crime boss named Nicola (Ron Perlman, looking like he wandered in from one of those Geico caveman commercials), but for what reason I don't know.  As far as I can tell, Drifter is just looking for a game of cards (which is banned) and Yoshi is on a mission from his father to get...something.<br /><br />The supporting cast is just as boring.  There's also Woody Harrelson as The Bartender (an odd name, \\"The\\"; did his parents hate him or were they just lazy?), the one local willing to help them, although it's in the form of cryptic riddles and pop-up books.  There's a girl involved as well, Nicola's beautiful but unwilling girlfriend (she joined him to save her true love's life; I have an idea who the true love is, but I didn't stick around to find out. I wonder if they get back together?).  Enough, enough, ENOUGH ALREADY!  I'M CALLING THE CLICH&Eacute; POLICE!<br /><br />I'm wondering if the writers purposely set out to throw every action movie clich&eacute; they could think of into this and then really REALLY hoped their paper-maiche sets would somehow distract us.  Would it have killed them to give us characters who weren't as thin as the paper they used for their sets?  Give me something, ANYTHING to make me care about any of the people in this, is that too much to ask?  For the makers of this film, it clearly was.y was.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|not bad i wish they would added more games with more detail.but it was quite great. soon i hope theres a new update.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love Calculator Plus; this is an excellent app. I love it  I would encourage everyone to download this app because i love this app!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|When i saw Avatar i was amazed, The Avengers took its place, high recommended movie, i want to see the blueray quality!!
0345803507|5.0|The whole series is wonderfull. I have never read anything like this before. I have always read J.D. Robb, but this series is on a whole nother level. And from following Amazon's blog on any books like Fifty Shades, there is not. So to me there is a market that needs to be filled. Calling ALL WRITERS, start typing,  fill this new exciting area. All who have read the series will be waiting with baited breath, to read more and more of the same.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Truly a great and easy app. I got this when it was the free app of the day and I am glad it was. Fun and easy to use. Packed with filters, ad-ons, and other edits makes this a great steal. Even though i got this free I would have gladly paid the $4.99.
034580404X|5.0|I really didn't wanna read these books because they sounded boring but a co worker kept pushing and so I caved..but i'm glad I did...cause they ended up being the best I had read in a long time.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\"-I liked this book but after awhile the way the same words and phrases were repeated it started really annoying me, and I was rolling my eyes every time I had to read about<br />  it. The sex scenes are never as racy as they make it sound so I can't say I understand what the fuss is there. All in all after I finished reading I wanted to keep going so<br />  I could find out what happened next.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades Darker\\"-I loved loved this one here...the first book I very slowly read but this one I could not put down, there was so much more to it and it really kept me on the edge of my seat...<br />  I did not want this one to end but alas it did and I had to move on.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades Freed\\"-I hated this book and was very disappointed with it..it was so boring until the last few chapters when it finally picked up and just as you were gettin into it it was over. I<br />  would most agree that if she had cut all the repeated lines and phrases and pointless sex scenes out this could have all been one big book..which would have been great.<br /><br />overall-While reading this I also found myself thinking where the heck was the editor with this?? It was poorly written in some ways and that made it very hard to get through, as well as the games that Anastasia played throughout the series..I got so sick of her asking questions all the time when she knew she should have stopped..I loved and hated this book for many reasons and as much as I was super annoyed with Ana for most of it and the writing style..I give this trilogy 5 stars because after you're done..you want more..how many books that annoy you also make you want more?? You just get so into these characters and their lives you can't help but love them...people wanna criticize these books for the sex but that isn't what it's about at all,there isn't even that much racy stuff..this is a love story about two people who go through the ups and downs of a relationship..learning to cope with who one another is. Don't we all go through that at some point?? Try for yourself..don't like it you can always sell them!se books for the sex but that isn't what it's about at all,there isn't even that much racy stuff..this is a love story about two people who go through the ups and downs of a relationship..learning to cope with who one another is.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have this game on my ipod and I love it. I think it is really fun on here too and I enjoy playing the wide varitey in games.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book...I had first heard about it after reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and everyone kept saying if you like that one you will like this one..well dead on!! It's not anything like Fifty but I loved the characters just as much..I could not put it down.  The thing that shocked me was that I loved every single character in the book and normally that does not happen for me.  I did not want it to end and was very sad when it did.  I do hope to see much more from this author in the future and would recommend this book to anybody looking for a really good quick read. I will miss these two characters as I really felt what they felt....and I don't care what the negative reviews say...the character of Travis was very well done and he had a reason for being the way he was..and I don't see Abby as a door mat, just a young woman in love for the first time with someone she never thought she would find that in. Give it a shot for $3 bucks you can't go wrong. I have read books that cost wayyyy more than that and were the crappiest thing I ever read.
B007Y1ARLA|1.0|This band is just another syrupy soft rock mess, play Keane, The Fray, and Scratch 45, all together, and it is all the same, stop picking your music form TV shows like Greys Anatomy,and the like, This stuff is like musical valium, Stop the madness ! But it sure beats the Biebs.

044042321X|1.0|I just buy A Game of Thrones: The Graphic Novel: Volume One. But in Ipad2 and Kindle Cloud Reader doesn't work. Only in my Android phone. I have upgraded Ipad to last version kindle app. What is wrong?
0062060562|2.0|So I read the book, and it seemed totally exciting, A woman that wakes up and doesn't know who the man that sleeps beside her is, and the house she's in.  She finds out that that is her husband, and that she's receiving secret[from her husband] therapy sessions with a Neurologist.<br /><br />After the page 100, it seemed totally the same and an illogical story. As she reads her diary, she finds out that she's actually progressing and remembering things, but it doesn't make sense, because in the start of the story she doesn't remember who her husband is!
B0086700CM|1.0|temple run is bad and anoyying.the game keeps freezing up if I do something wrong.the only reason I decided to get temple run was because I heard about the brave version. but because the kindle fire is so out of date its not on the appstore
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Love the app on my iPad but on the Kindle Fire the  Facebook login only brings up a blank screen and Twitter says \\"loading\\" forever.  Since I only use Flipboard with my social media feeds I gave it two stars.  Five stars if those would work.

B007R41E8O|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and that the pros outweigh the cons. Sure the ending is a bit hesitant, but the graphics were unbelievable and the storyline keeps you on your toes. Very addicting. This game costs less than a pack of gum and is a lot more fun!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was a pretty good app. I liked it except for the ads. the ads makes me want to delete the app.
0060555661|5.0|There are a lot of reviews on this book, so I will keep mine brief and confine to my opinions of the books contents.<br /><br />Early on, the book clearly distinguishes between an investor and a trader/speculator. The book is intended for investors only.<br /><br />I found the commentary and examples more interesting than the original content by Mr. Graham. Even though the examples provided are about 10 years old, they are very relavant to present day.

B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever I am so glad they put it on the app store. everyone needs to get this game they will love it
1597801585|5.0|So many reviews have already covered this novel in excellent detail, I will simply focus on my own immediate feelings in reading it because while I was reading this novel, there were stories breaking in the news about a pesticide that has been found to kill the very bees that pollinate our crops.  Is that the small first step toward the grim reality Bacigalupi has pictured for our world 200 years from now?  Will calorie companies ultimately control the destiny of our world and societies, waging war to destroy crops and sell their own foodstuffs for profit, and stealing priceless genetic material to manufacture new crops to sell?  All of this novel felt far too real, too plausible and frightening to be mere fiction.<br /><br />There are other interesting moral questions raised in this novel.  Ever since reading 'Kiln People' by David Brin, I have pondered the ethical implications inherent in a proposed ability to create 'human-style' life forms.  In The Windup Girl, the created ones are genetically engineered to have traits not necessarily associated with standard humans.  We've already seen what happens when cats and dogs are overbred to emphasize or minimize a characteristic- we get beautiful animals with hidden physical faults and nervous personalities, losing an essential quality of the original animal.  The Windup Girl herself is one of the New People, a created creature human in aspect, but with a tendency to overheat internally, which becomes an interesting analogy to what happens when her outrage, pain and anger cause her to overheat emotionally and override her rigid training.<br /><br />In this kind of desperate society, there is no one whose hands are clean, and so there is perhaps only one heroic figure in this novel who can carry forward the banner of principle and caution. But all the others are drawn so well that it is possible to understand them and their motives, if not to like them all.  This is one of those superb science fictions novels- character-driven and based in good hard science with a compelling cautionary storyline.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the ending too, which is rare for me.  It closed well and with a twist. In my opinion it is needed to grasp the readers opinion and I sure hell had one from chapter 1.  It's a gripping read.

B003XT603Q|5.0|The first line of the Beatles' great song, Norwegian Wood, describes the general context of Murakami's slice of  human development novel: \\"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.\\" The popular Japanese author systematically sets the stage for exploration of love relationships during the critical period of ages 17 to 20 in contemporary Tokyo. During this period, people feel compelled to make lasting commitments even though they are struggling with the transition from idealism to realism, from being children to becoming adults in a competitive culture. The story of four main characters who believe they have only a small window of freedom to decide on their life paths shows readers the dangers of confusing movement with action.<br /><br />Murakami focuses on the interaction of four main characters who discover that during the late adolescent years, if they avoid the hard psychological work of making the transition from childhood illusion to adult realism, there will be lifetime consequences. The narrator, Toru Watanabe, has  a phlegmatic personality reminiscent of Thomas Mann's character, Hans Castorp, in The Magic Mountain. Like Hans, Toru is a rather naive young man from a middle class family who has learned to enjoy his youthful pleasures without making undue efforts to prepare for life's inevitable adult challenges. This avoidance of direction is reinforced by his relationship with a beautiful young girl, Naoko, who has maintained an idyllic relationship with her childhood boyfriend Kizuki even though the two realize they will not be able to live like children after their adolescent years, when they turn 20. Toru happily plays the friend of both, assuming a lackadaisical attitude and enjoying his own maturing pleasures though his self-understanding is delayed. Toru's roommate, Nagasawa is the epitome of this self-indulgent uncommitted lifestyle and Toru learns the art of using casual relationships with girls to satisfy sexual if not emotional needs.<br /><br />The ages 17 to 20 allow for exploration and preparation for adult roles, including some forgiveness for errors of judgment. But, at the end of this idyllic period, major choices loom. The characters must decide on maintaining ideals of carefree childhood at all costs (like Naoko and Kizuki), confronting the realization that they have a responsibility for accepting their own ultimate solitude in life and death (like Toru), or actively avoiding any real choices in life taking the path of least resistance to the best deal (like Nagasawa).<br /><br />Toru's favorite novel is The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald that features a man who refuses to give up his lost youthful illusions. But, Toru rereads The Magic Mountain at a time of transitional crisis that features Hans Castorp who decides to leave the dependent life on the mountain to take on the realistic and ultimately solitary role of a responsible adult on the flatlands. The readers will greatly enjoy discovering the decisions Toru makes during his transition of what Erik Erikson called the Intimacy versus Isolation psychosocial crisis. Is Toru most like Jay Gatsby or Hans Castorp?/><br />The ages 17 to 20 allow for exploration and preparation for adult roles, including some forgiveness for errors of judgment.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed these books as did everyone that I know that has read them. Take them for what they are...entertainment. I couldn't put the books down. I read all three in 5 days and re-read them. The story is so much deeper then what the media makes them out to be. Great reading!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't get enough of these books! I couldn't put it down and then I bought there other two right after. At some points I was annoyed with Anastasia and the whole lip biting habit but the plot drew me in and it was very well written.

B0064W65UM|4.0|As the title of my review states this novel is fantastic however its suffers on the kindle. I much rather read the book version of this title because with the flick of a finger your on the next page. As for the comic book novel on the kindle it is a effort to read. There's a lot of zooming in and that made this hard to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this is a pretty good series.  I usually am not a big reader but the books kept me reading.  Maybe its because the author always keeps you guessing about Christian and his ways or what will happen to them next?  The only downfall is the repeating of the same words.  That was a little annoying but I was able to make up my own as I was reading. :)  good book if you want to spice up your sex life!!!!  :)
0061692042|5.0|This is probably one of the most affecting books I have read in the past year.  It will be memorable.

0061733199|5.0|This guide is pretty hard to beat. It's concise, fun to read, and pretty damn useful. I've gone through several copies over the years, getting a new one after I lost or beat up the old one. It's absolutely fantastic. It has tons of pictures to show you how to set up traps or shelter and the wild edibles section is entirely in color, which is obviously a very good thing. It has an overview of how to survive in different climates, such as desert survival, woodlands, prairie, open ocean, tundra, and jungle environments. It even has a section on urban survival! Its broad enough to be of use to most people in the world, and narrow enough to help YOU. It has a great section on your kit, and explains how to make a very efficient pocket survival tin.<br /><br />Overall, you really can't find a more comprehensive book.

0385737955|4.0|At the book fair a few weeks ago our librarian said that she thought The Maze Runner was going to be the next hot series with teens. It has a lot of same appeal that The Hunger Games has with teens. On her recommendation I purchased a copy.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of science fiction, but I did find myself up late trying to find out what was going to happen next. Fifty or so teenage boys are trapped in a glade. On one side of the glade is a maze that they have spent two years trying to figure out how to solve. Several boys have evolved into leaders and everyone is assigned a job. Everyday everyone does their assigned job, that is until Thomas arrives and everything they have known for the last two years suddenly begins to change.<br /><br />Before being sent to the glade Thomas' memories are altered so that he doesn't remember people from his life before the glade. Almost immediately, though, Thomas feels like the glade is familiar and that he wants to be a runner, the elite job in the glade.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book. James Dashner did a good job of creating a new language for the boys so that it would be teen appropriate. I'm very interested to see what happens to the boys in the next book, The Scorch Trials. As a middle school teacher I would recommend this book to my students.

B008DB3N5W|4.0|I must admit that I too wondered a loud what Joey was thinking with the bass on this  album! It was annoying and I was initially disappointed, however something happened on my way to thrashing the album. The track Righteous Glory came on and it sounded excellent. So I went back and played each track and heard what I missed being distracted by Joey's bass guitar. I heard musical notes not played by this band in at least a decade. The more I listen the more the volume went up and then \\"I GOT IT\\", WHAT AN ALBUM THIS ONE IS!!!!  I am not going into some spill about meeting Manowar in 1986 and helping the band unload equipment for their show, or how I named my band VALHALLA after hearing that song from their Into glory ride album, nope I am not gonna waste time doing that. This album has diamonds, rubies and a topaz or two. Guitar solos are good(better than previous albums and sound more distinct, drums are good(I prefer more kick from the bass but the snare has plenty of Pop) Vocally (well Eric sounds better than ever). I would suggest several listens before the bass stops distracting and it will, then make your own judgement. I love it especially, touch the sky, born in a grave, righteous glory,black list(listen to the bass on this one) and Annihilation.

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Simple search for items game.  Some thankfully skippable &quot;dialog&quot; and a couple of minorly fun variations on the theme. Had a couple of problems with locking up or crashing after level completes. One feature that feels shady: after level completion it pops up a screen asking for you to log into Facebook apparently in order to continue.  Click around and wait a bit and it will pass and let you continue.  Not inspiring me to purchase any G5 games but it's fine.
0099579928|3.0|I think the trilogy would have been better left as a single story.  The first book was great, in my opinion.  Though, at times, a little repetitive, it was still fun to read.  I kept telling myself one more chapter and I'll go to bed, and then I'd be up all night.  The first book I couldn't put down.  And I think leaving it without the happy hollywood ending was much better.  Two people extremely attracted to one another but just too different.  I think that was perfect as is.  In this story, it's less than a week before they start communicating again, and that disappointed me.  It made the first books ending seem trivial.  Then there are constant repeating.  I love you, do you love me, I wont leave, I am leaving.  I understand people can change their mind, especially when they are in love and that's part of what I liked about the first book.  It seemed realistic in how she felt.  Her insecurities, etc.  But in this book, I just want to shake her and tell her to shut up.  Stop questioning yourself. And for the love of god, stop questioning him.  How he puts up with your constant interrogations is beyond me.  She goes from innocent but smart to completely oblivious in this book.  And you start to think she is there for the money?  Would she put up with him if he had no money? But, with all of that said...  I still read it and am happy to move on to book three.  It is interesting to get some more insight into his back story and watch these two screwed up people try and find themselves, in love.  But there needed to be more story and less being in her head, for hours on end.  It gets grating.
B004132HZS|5.0|So what would happen if you a.) updated Sherlock Holmes to the 21st century and b.) threw in excellent writing and production values? Well, I suppose the brief answer is that you'd get something like this series. (This is ONLY a review of Season 1, btw... it really isn't fair to give away Season 2 spoilers when we're *supposed* to be reviewing just one season!)<br /><br />The real delight is in the way that original canon is updated, twisted around, and expanded. If you've read the originals, you'll know what carries over into *Study In Pink\\", for example. (Updating Watson's gold watch to a cell phone being especially clever.) As for the character... I've worked a lot with PTSD/dissociative folks, and yes, with ASPD'ers, so that informs my understanding of what's happened with the characters. Watson's character really has to be based on the most accurate analysis I've ever seen, and it's all in the original canon. We can clearly see by reading *Study in Scarlet* that he did indeed have pretty severe PTSD (called \\"battle fatigue\\" or \\"shell shock\\" at the time. Okay, I don't know if the latter term was really in use before WWI.) And this take on the character goes a long way towards explaining why a war vet who supposedly only wanted peace and quiet ended up working with SH. Nothing will haunt those with PTSD as much as missing what caused the trauma in the first place, and that's made very clear here.<br /><br />But I will say that SH's character isn't really quite what it is in canon. The original was motivated by a profound love of justice in the abstract, and you will NOT find that in the update. Also, although canon SH found it utterly impossible to express his emotions-- yes, even by Victorian standards, which is saying a lot-- he just wasn't at the low level we see here. For instance, I can't imagine the 21st century version ever saying that he wouldn't want his sister in Violet Hunter's situation in *Copper Beeches.* OTOH, he's definitely not a high-functioning sociopath, whatever he may say (and it's Antisocial Personality Disorder, btw, writers!@!!) I have worked with MANY of those, and they don't act that way. I would peg this SH as being much more likely to be on the far end of the severely dissociative spectrum, with a big extra helping of some Asberger's type thing.<br /><br />So overall, watching this can be a very disturbing experience, PARTICULARLY if you are very familiar with the mental disorders being portrayed. I don't understand how anyone thought this was primarily \\"funny\\" or \\"appropriate for the whole family.\\" (I guess it depends on what kind of family you're talking about...)But if you watch this, you'll never forget it. And there aren't many shows like that.sociopath, whatever he may say (and it's Antisocial Personality Disorder, btw, writers!@!!) I have worked with MANY of those, and they don't act that way.

030758836X|4.0|I am a big fan of Flynn and her latest had me up reading into the night.  It's one of those books that can go in any direction when you least expect it and does.  The ending was a bit implausible but it didn't ruin things for me.  I found the characters and plot both clever and inventive.  The idea of a real woman both inspiring and being warped by a beloved fictional character was perfect.  Can't wait for her next book.

0307592731|3.0|I found Strayed to be a very good writer and I enjoyed the book.  While I appreciated her honesty about her younger self, the constant dumb mistakes (drug use, divorcing rather than trying to salvage her marriage, unprotected sex with strangers, etc) grew repetitive.  I expected more appreciation of nature and the outdoors which is not a huge part of this book. She seemed to rush through those parts to get to the stops where she could buy lemonade and cheeseburgers and look for men.  Still I found her journey and the people she met interesting and the ending was satisfying.  I think the trip helped her grow up and get past her early losses, which was the intent. All in all, a good memoir of youth.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity(released Aug/05)is a quite decent Sci-Fi flick that is descended from the TV series Firefly.I have never seen Firefly the TV series,but am aware of the serie's premature cancellation and the following it has developed.As a Star Trek original series fan I know all about such things.So this review is really kind of reverse engineering in a literary sense and a look at this film in situ.<br />The movie begins aboard the spaceship Serenity captained by the less than loquacious Capt.Reynolds(Nathan Fillion).He was on the losing side of the Unification War against the Alliance(similarities abound in likening him to a soldier from the South during the Civil War)and during a maintenance stop at a space station the captain takes aboard two strangers,a brother and sister.The sister(River Tam) has obvious strong mental abilities and her brother is the only one that can keep her in check.She periodically refers to \\"Miranda\\" but no one including herself can understand what it means. They risk being tossed off the ship many times but the captain sees past the risk.<br />However,not only does the government have a special agent following Tam,the Alliance is sending out special triggering signals to set her off,whenever possible.The captain contacts a friend called Mr Universe who discovers that these \\"triggers\\"are for a special purpose.They also eventually learn that Miranda is an uninhabited planet that was devastated,supposedly,due to a terraforming accident years before.They decide to head for Miranda and  along the way they stop in at a familiar outpost and safe haven only to find all have been slaughtered,thanks to an Alliance agent who wants Tam back.<br />After a running battle they escape the planet and head for their ultimate destination.However the way is blocked by Reavers,a savage half human race whose thirst for blood is only surpassed by their thirst for killing.Disguising themselves they get their ship past the blockade.On Miranda there is no one there alive,it is just full of corpses.They also discover what really happened on Miranda was not a simple terraforming accident.There was an agent put into the chemical used,to suppress aggression which killed most of the populace while turning the rest into Reavers.<br />This disturbing information is sent to Mr Universe who is killed before he can transmit it broad band throughout the Alliance territories.Reynolds and crew head back to see Mr Universe but are followed by the Reavers.They discover a dead Mr Universe and have to hold off the Reavers until they can transmit a back up copy.Some of Reynolds crew dies but the attacking Reavers are repelled and the message is sent out.The Alliance operative after Tam finally realizes the extent of the Alliances crimes and backs off the hunt,but it doesn't mean more agents won't follow him and Tam,who now becomes one of Reynolds crew.<br />It is an exciting plot throughout and holds ones interest all the way.I was pleasantly surprised to see some fine actors like Gina Torres,who goes by Gin Torres in the credits,better known for her roles in Hercules and Cleopatra 2020 among others,Adam Baldwin who I recall from X Files and old Ron Glass from Barney Miller.The entire cast gels beautifully and the glue is Fillion himself who does a wonderful job as the persnickety captain of the Serenity,who likes to run his ship HIS way.As I said this review is coming from someone who has never seen the show,so if I am suitably impressed by the movie and its world and what its creator Joss Whedon is presenting,then I think that is really saying something.It stands alone as just plain good Science Fiction.<br />Technically speaking this DVD comes in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,is clear and crisp,and includes extras like a Whedon intro,commentary,a featurette on the Firefly phenom and 20 minutes of extra deleted scenes and outtakes.<br />All in all Serenity is a wonderful stand alone film.For the fans of Firefly it's just a natural to get,but anyone interested in good Sci-Fi should be picking this up too.If you're like me it will probably lead you to pursue the short lived TV series to see just what the fuss is all about and maybe become a \\"brown shirt\\" along the way.Hmmm, a brown shirt Trekker...it could work!Highly recommended.ested in good Sci-Fi should be picking this up too.If you're like me it will probably lead you to pursue the short lived TV series to see just what the fuss is all about and maybe become a \\"brown shirt\\" along the way.Hmmm, a brown shirt Trekker...it could work!Highly recommended.
B007OXWWX4|3.0|First of all, I want to say that I have been a fan of Slash and Guns N Roses (the real band, not the current one) for many years now. As a matter of fact, he was the one that made me want to pick up a guitar and be a musician, something I have been doing for the past 14 years of my life, and that I intend to keep on doing until I die.<br /><br />Having said that, I get excited every time I hear that Slash will release a new record. Both Snakepit records and both Velvet Revolver records are great, and I was not disappointed in those. However, I was a little taken aback when I heard his first true solo album a few years ago. I like the album, but it was different from everything he had done before. I figured that, since he had so many guest musicians and vocalists, he had to change his style a little to fit each one as best he could.<br /><br />Then, I found out about this one, with Myles Kennedy as a singer. I thought the idea was pretty interesting, as Myles is a good singer, but as I heard the album, I realized that many of its songs sound very similar. I would have it playing in the background as I did other things, thinking the same song was still playing, but it was already the next one, or the one after the next one. I have listened to the album more closely again, and I got the same impression.<br /><br />I am disappointed because, as I said before, his stuff with Snakepit and Velvet Revolver is awesome, with songs that are clearly defined in style and that feature cool signature riffs. With this album, I think Slash just continued to play stuff that he knows is safe for him to do, like he did in the previous album. I know what Slash can do; I have studied his playing for years now, and this is as vanilla as it gets for him. Not to say it's not pleasant to my ears, but it still left me wanting more.<br /><br />There are some cool moments on the record, such as the single \\"You're a Lie\\", but my favorite song is \\"Anastasia.\\" That is the one song where Slash andcompany dared to try something a bit different from the rest of the album, and the result is amazing. Listen to that song, and then listen to the rest of the album, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Finally, before anyone rants about how he is not in Guns, Snakepit, or Velvet Revolver (?) anymore and that he doesn't have to play like that anymore, I was not expecting him to play stuff like that. However, if you listen to the records he has done throughout the years, you'll notice there was a growth to his playing, an evolution, if you like. With the past couple records, it feels as though he has found a place where he knows the fans won't give him too much trouble. Slash, you can do better man. Hopefully the next one will be a better vehicle for your ideas.

B001F6ZIXC|5.0|and I was pleasantly surprised. FIrst of all, I'm a big fan of the Sopranos and here's why: It was one of the first shows I ever watched that portrayed the \\"bad guys\\" in shades of grey rather than characters capable of only evil. The dichotomy created by making the evil-doers on the show act like \\"regular people\\" capable of regular emotions and then allowing these same people to do what many of us would find unthinkable makes for some incredibly entertaining television. The Sons does this...and it does it well.<br /><br />Granted, it's not always stellar programming. I almost wish these kind of shows would be on HBO or Showtime because anytime there's a love scene it sorta breaks the fourth wall. I'm also not really a fan of Katy Segal's ability to see every major plot point on the show. For example, each show usually has two major plot lines: one focused on whatever caper the crew is up to and the other focused on some sort of internal drama affecting the crew. Well for the internal drama Katy Segal is usually right there to witness every crucial event and move the story along. Might not sound too bad but it gets really old after awhile. There were times where Katy, at an event of about 50 people, would just conveniently be at the right place at the right time to witness something. Or maybe an ancillary character is at a grocery and bounces a check and Katy just so happens to be at the same store. It's almost like the writers couldn't figure out a way to move the story along so they used her as a means to get the plot moving. She does an excellent job acting on the show (as does most of the cast btw), but by the 6th episode I just knew she would show up anytime there was something pertaining to the second plot line in an episode.<br /><br />But that aside, you're probably wondering what the show's about. Sons is focused on a biker gang based in a small town in California that operate out of a auto mechanic shop. The mechanic shop is the front and the real money ismade via selling guns. There are rival crews, crooked cops, internal drama and all sorts of other things that occur along the way to make for interesting television. The main character seems to be Jax, who is the 30-year old second in command who's father was also in the Sons. Jax's mother is played by Peggy Bundy and the leader of the Sons, and Peggy's boyfriend on the show, is Ron Perlman (the guy with the most unique face ever).<br /><br />The stories are varied and, so far, incredibly innovative. As I mentioned before, it really makes for great television when the bad guys sometimes have a higher moral compass than the good guys and, conversely, the good guys behave in ways the bad guys never would. The key thing is that the show doesn't let you get too comfortable with the Sons. Anytime I found myself rooting for them I was quickly reminded how they are brutal criminals responsible for a variety of violent crimes.<br /><br />I'm six episodes in and so far the show has been great. The bikers all look the part (although I'm not too sure why the actor who plays Jax thinks walking like George Jefferson circa 1970 is a tough guy walk) and the angle is intriguing. In a world where everyone is content to copy what the other guys are doing it was cool to get something like this.  If you're into crime-dramas and find biker gangs somewhat interesting then I strongly recommend this show...especially if you have Amazon Prime and

1401234542|4.0|Ok ill say this is a five star book if your a GL fan, but if you expect to just jump in with this book, it's like a 2 star, not for reasons of art or writing, but you will be lost, it's very heavy in GL lore from the johns era and in that respect it continues a great legacy, i own all the johns GL other than rebirth (but have read it), in fact i re-read all the trades before reading this so it was like one epic and it makes me want the next volume so badly with his clisshanger ending.<br /><br />now for those who are up on their GL, get this, it's not as epic as some of the other books, a little more grounded and character centric, but thats a good thing as we build to what i assume is another epic in a year or two (always is), and it makes you wish sinestro would stay a character with his own title, i assume again hal will take over at some point but who knows, and no matter what, johns will make you love it, like his time on flash, he makes GL THE book to read..who would have guessed?
0345803485|5.0|What Made Me Want to Read the Book?<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, they were interviewing E L James on some show, and they were talking about how provactive this book was and how popular it has become. After the interview was over, another show came on, and they were talking about this book again. It caught my attention. Two shows in a row talking about Fifty Shades of Grey. I had to read the book. Let's note that I never EVER read books unless I really want to, and Fifty Shades of Grey was one book I HAD to read.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />This book isn't perfect, I will admit. But I loved it. Anstasia Steele (the main character) does get a bit annoying, though. Her weird phrases, like \\"Oh my...\\" get very..... over-used? And she is constantly flushing. She brings up Christian Grey's (the crazy-ass-sex-freak lover interest) long fingers a lot, too. Things are very repetative. You'll also hear from her \\"Inner Goddess\\" and \\"subconsious\\" throughout the book. Those are the things that kinda annoyed me. She also orgasms SO EASILY. You could think about having sex with her and she'd have an orgasm.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book, though. It's a very cute, very provactive love story. And I loved it. So many people are giving this book a negative review, and it dissapoints me. Like I said. The book isn't perfect. But it's not a bad book at all!<br /><br />I am going to continue reading this triolgy, and I am looking forward to more from Ms. E L James.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|I was on the verge of giving this movie the full 5 stars but try to save all 5 stars for TRULY RARE WONDERFUL movies that you can't live without in your collection!  I really, really like Justin Timberlake's and Mila Kunis' acting!  This is a fun, feel-good movie that doesn't REALLY have surprises (except, oddly enough, at the VERY beginning) but is such a FUN, engrossing movie, you don't care!  People who try to keep emotions out of emotionally-charged situations are probably always, at the very least, \\"interesting\\" to watch...  I recommend this movie!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is fun and challenging but not too hard. Storyline is kind of long but overall good characters. If you like hidden objects games this game is for you.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|As horrible as Ghost Rider 2 was...this was worse.  Complete stupidity from start to finish and a chapter in the Aliens franchise I will pretend never happened.  If you care even a little about a well written or intelligent story, DO NOT WATCH IT!!!!!
B008COD5OO|5.0|So first off me and my older brother just saw the  preview and we were already sold.  If that doesn't catch it just watch the first 30 minutes.  They steal a gnome! If you are looking for something  that will make you laugh your rear off then i'd definately say this movie. I'd give give 5 thumbs up and the video shots of this were epic.
B00785P2QC|3.0|yep I indeed am doing this just for the goal. And now they say I need to write more for it to count.
B00884GR0W|1.0|worst game i ever played it has aggresive mobs before u get a wepon and u cant destroy anything with out a tool it is a rip off of minecraft and its not even fun or good
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|A perfect combination of all the best parts of the previous four albums. Living things is everything that makes Linkin Park what they are into a single album. They really show how much they've matured as artists. Unfortunately its waaaay too short (only about 38min). I'm really looking forward to seeing how they're gonna top this one. Living Things is definitely a MUST buy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays just the way I learned it cards. I like that I don't beat it each time. Good to play while we watch baseball on Tv This is the first game app I've gotten from Amazon.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I truly enjoyed the beautiful graphic and good background music in this one. If there will be Magic Academy 2, i would definitely play it.

B006R8GK2Q|2.0|does not work on my galaxy s2. only half the graphics load. 2 stars because I did play the free version a while back and that worked. shame had to un-install.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|If your a lover of 1980's music look no further than the soundtrack to the film \\"Rock of Ages\\" starring Tom Crusie. Various songs made popular by acts like Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Poison and Twisted Sister\\" are performed by the movie's cast member's and sound surprisingly good. Tom Crusie especially shows off his vocal prowness in \\"Paradise City\\", \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" and \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". Mary J. Blidge, the only true singer in the cast, gives a remarkable performance on \\"Harden my Heart\\".
B00846F1YW|5.0|this is a very good game and it doesn't go by too fast either. it was well worth the 2.99. also if ask u if u want to post ur progress on facebook or twitter. all u have to do is press the X on the top right cornor and than if goes away. I was able play the whole game without posting a thing cuz I pressed that X. ;)
B007U1FEJE|3.0|I'm so glad these guys could reunite and make one last good album. Yes, I said \\"album.\\" And TWGMTR has a little bit of everything for every Beach Boys fan.<br /><br />After the gorgeous lyricless first track, there are three songs that would've been bona fide singles for the band in another era. To me, \\"Isn't It Time\\" is the freshest and most well-crafted, but, alas, it's the title track which is given top billing. While well-executed, \\"That's Why...\\" is a completely across-the-plate, mid-60s-Beach-Boys-by-the-numbers, mid-tempo song certain to get 70-year-olds on the dancefloor at VFW halls.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are also some songs for the Beach Boys fans who appreciated albums like 20/20, Friends and Sunflower. In that spirit, the final three close this record out quite nicely. And I will go so far as to say \\"Summer's Gone\\" is one of the 25 best songs the band ever created. It is certifiably headphone-a-liscious.<br /><br />This long-awaited long-player also features the least filler of anything they've made since Love You (and before that, Surf's Up), which is quite a compliment, considering everything these guys (especially Brian) have been through over the years. That said, there's nothing all that special about these 12 songs (save for the closer) other than the fact that they were able to reunite and make them in the first place...and frankly, for me, that's special enough.<br /><br />My final nit with what may be this amazing band's final album of new material will undoubtedly be considered trivial and perhaps even absurd by many -- the sequencing of the songs. It's as if they let the lawyers and money guys determine the track listing. As a result, TWGMTR just doesn't flow together as deftly as so many of the band's previous efforts seemed to.<br /><br />Thankfully, that was easily fixed for me: I loaded the CD into my iTunes, then channeled my inner \\"Purple Chick\\" and re-sequenced everything, leaving only four songs where they were to begin with. I am very pleased with the end result, and I encourage you to find the sequence that feels \\"most like home\\" to you.<br /><br />For me, I thought about it in 33 1/3 terms...SIDE ONE: Think About The Days, Spring Vacation, Isn't It Time, TWGMTR and The Private LIfe of Bill and Sue, Strange World. SIDE TWO: Beaches In Mind, Shelter, Daybreak Over The Ocean, From There To Back Again, Pacific Coast Highway, Summer's Gone. I would give my own thoughtfully re-sequenced version 3.75 stars.<br /><br />And while I have absolutely no desire to catch their reunion tour oldies show (too many \\"hits,\\" not enough Brother era), I very much wish to thank Brian and the band for giving the world one more really good Beach Boys record to go along with Pet Sounds, Surf's Up, Sunflower, Love You, 20/20, Friends and the newly-released original SMILE.<br /><br />The Beach Boys will always be one of the most important bands to come from the US. Brian Wilson, you are and always will be an American treasure. Carl and Dennis, your oldest brother did you proud.am very pleased with the end result, and I encourage you to find the sequence that feels \\"most like home\\" to you.<br /><br />For me, I thought about it in 33 1/3 terms...SIDE ONE: Think About The Days, Spring Vacation, Isn't It Time, TWGMTR and The Private LIfe of Bill and Sue, Strange World.

0307743659|5.0|In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization, and the writing of a young Stephen King. One of King's top five novels.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I pretty much love anything Tom Crusie is in (he's by far my favorite actor), but when I heard he was doing a movie about rock music from the 1980's and that he himself was performing his own singing I went, \\"What?!!!\\". When I did see \\"Rock of Ages\\" I realized Tom was not the main lead, but he still stole every scene he was in and his voice was amazing. Probably unlike any role he's done before Tom saved the movie due to his acting and vocal ability, but the movie did become panned by critics and became a box office flop only making $33,000,000 as of June 26th, 2012 on a budget of $75,000,000.<br /><br /> The script is far from original as Tom plays a singer who's parade and career is passing him by as he encounters a new up and coming singer who wants all the money and glamor fame can attain.<br /><br /> There are some pretty big heavy-weights seen in other roles including Alex Baldwin and Mary J. Blidge who are really wasted.<br /><br /> Still, see the film if you love Tom Cruise and '80's music.
B007V508CC|2.0|I am sad to say that this album sounds... unoriginal, mainstream, disappointing because I LOVE Maroon 5. I've been a fan since they were Kara's Flowers and Overexposed is exactly what Maroon 5 is now. I'm sad.
B000B63IEI|4.0|I am increasingly seduced by the elegant manner in which Norwegian virtuoso Leif Ove Andsnes deals with the gems of the piano literature. He is also a refined chamber partner and a researcher in unknown musical realms. In this respect some Nordic composers have been excellently advocated by this pianist.<br /><br />On this recording - devoted to the first two concertos by Rachmaninov - Andsnes is paired by the celebrated Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Sir Antonio Pappano. Of course, one can do any comparisons with other versions (Rachmaninov himself, Ashkenazy, Richter, Zimerman etc.) or look for weaknesses of such a \\"soft\\" approach. But, in my opinion, the present CD is a valuable one and does not betray this wonderful music. Andsnes commands unimpeachably the technical details of the scores. From musical point of view he conceives the proceedings with a kind of detached melancholy, instead of burning at the keyboard. This could seem indeed a bit strange when it comes to Rachmaninov's music... but I think the recorded sound plays a role in this impression. It is somehow flat and feeble, although the Berliners ensure an attentive orchestral support.<br /><br />Far from being a failure, this recording deserves an honorable place in the catalogue of the famous post-romantic composer.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Long and bloody, but good.  I'm currently on the fourth book, so I'm willing to deal with the length and the gore.  This is the second book, and you definitely need to read the first one first to know what is going on.  Once you do that, you will read the subsequent books.  It's about kings and castles and intrigues, wars, arranged marriages, and death.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book will be good. Ive only read the first. It has.to be good. Yes. The first book was great so Ill enjoy this book veryyy m uch. Mmmmm Gurll!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. it is fun. but I wish that the energy would reload quicker. and I wouldst love to be able to control more people.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Compelling storyline with characters you can easily care about.  I'd like to think of humanity hanging on to its conscience even in the face of insurmountable odds and glad to see people take action when they confront fraud and governmental injustice of the highest order.  Makes you understand why sometimes war is necessary and why people step up at the risk of their own lives to fight for what is right.  This may not so much be science fiction as it is a long range forecast.  Congrats to HUGH HOWEY on this startlingly awesome story.  Can't wait to read more of these compelling characters and dearly hope a movie is already in the works!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game. ever play it its addicting I love it so much I play it every day. alsobyou can win awards
B003L77GRO|5.0|It's Dexter season 5, kinda know what you're getting there.  Just as good as the other seasons, if you've watched them you'll need to keep watching.  This dvd set came timely and with no scratches.  Can't ask for more, right?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this so helpful. I use this every night. I love the read to me thing. It reads to you! SERIOUSLY! Use you're minds. Less reading more understanding. Thank you so much for this app.
0446579939|3.0|It's a nice summer read if you are looking for something that is easy to read and you like Nicholas Sparks. Other than that, I would not recommend.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I highly recommend this book for any creative person.  Essentially everyone.  Mr. Pressfield does not coddle the reader.  \\"Resistance\\" is our biggest enemy and he tells us exactly why and the many forms and disguises of resistance.  In any battle one must know the enemy well to defeat them.  I really like that he also touches on the spiritual creative forces, but not in a fundamental way. He in fact, lists \\"fundamentalism\\" as a form of resistance ... a very sinister form of resistance.  Absolutely the best book I have read to date on creative motivation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it does its job would be cool if they could make it like a TI calculater with more to do with it but it is a free calculater
B00881VLCE|4.0|this app is very fun! the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish there were more pictures to choose from. other than that, its a wonderful, fun,  cute way to pass the time.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is my very first review for any product or movie on Amazon. I never write reviews, because I feel like 1 opinion won't make a difference in the long run. Despite that, this movie touched me so deeply that I just had to share my experience with those looking for an opinion.<br /><br />I am an avid fan of supernatural horror. I strongly dislike slasher movies, especially since the blood and gore is often as fake as the horrible acting. Needless to say, I've pretty much seen every ghost and \\"haunting\\" movie that I could get my hands on. Because of that, I expected this to be another \\"run of the mill\\" ghost story. I will agree with some reviewers that the plot of the movie isn't revolutionary. However, the techniques and scares used in this film are a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe truly made me connect with his character. He does an astounding job in this movie. His deep, straightforward, blue eyes add to the atmosphere of the movie. In most scenes, he is alone, but that doesn't detract from the mood of the film at all. He carries the movie to new heights with his brilliant performance.<br /><br />The effects are amazing. The graphics and \\"old-school\\" techniques used for the scares here work wonders. I am not an easy scare, yet I found myself so enraptured and entranced by the tension that I was gripping the seat and biting my nails at some points. Even an hour after watching the movie, I was still remembering parts of it and rubbing my arms to get rid of my goosebumps. The only other movie that scared me this much was \\"The Haunting\\", a film that was incredible and worth watching many times over.<br /><br />To the reviewers leaving such poor scores - Yes, of course everyone will react differently. Not all movies will please everyone. Some will see \\"fake\\" effects, while others don't \\"connect\\" with the characters. In the end, it's all a matter of opinion. Still, I hope that those trying to decided whether this movie is worth it or not will consider giving this film a fair chance. Just decide what sort of you person you are - are you willing to relax and put yourself in this character's shoes, or will you spend the entirety of the film looking for \\"fake\\" effects? If you are the first, then this film is definitely for you!
0439023513|5.0|Short and to the point: I was left drained after reading this book but I have to say as dark as this third book has been it made sense. There is no fairytale for soldiers after war or those who have experienced the levels of devastation the characters have. The ending made sense. Was it really realistic to think a passionate love affair would develop out of such dark times? Or is it more realistic to think that love develops out of a need or emptiness left after such trying times? This last book was dark yes- but action packed and I could not turn the pages fast enough. LOVED the series.
B0086700CM|2.0|this game is very fun the first time you play it, but after a little while it gets pretty boring. the fact that this game doesn't have an ending makes it no fun. do you wanna spend all day trying to win this endless game? I know I don't.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|fun and easy.  I like games that I don't have to totally concentrate on.<br />I could listen to Tv and play.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Love the clutter!  Challenges the brain to search for objects both by word and shape!  Great way to use the brain and relax at the same time.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|good program, but it frequently fails to refresh. It claims the Internet connection is lost when everything else is working fine. Otherwise, it's a nice program to have.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is pretty cool. I have only played it for a little while, though. Lots of fun! You should download it.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|could use having to use less glu coins.  and maybe use less money for leveling up your characters. its an ok game for free.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|if images of large hairy spiders freak you out this may not be the game for you. there have been quite a few in the scenes and was even once the object you had to find.<br /><br />other than that its an ok game. I don't have facebook and it keeps asking me to login which is annoying, but I am able so far to still move through the game without doing so.
0099579936|5.0|I started reading this book on my mom's iPad because I was bored.  I had no idea what it was about just heard that it was a hit. After reading a page I couldn't stop reading.  I had never been able to keep reading and reading a book before.  I read for 9 hours straight, then the next day finished this book.  Yes, it's unconventional and weird, but its an amazing love store and its interesting to see how it unfolds.  Extremely interesting that I couldn't wait to get the second book. I went and got it two hours after finishing the first one!  Christian Grey has an elegance and sophistication to him, and that makes a great character - also Anna Steele, has an amazing personality that's funny and sarcastic, which most girls can relate to.  Can't wait to finish the set of books.  These are amazing.  I will pick up another E.L. James book!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is perfect for us poor prople afflicted with obsessive compulsive disorder!! I am obsessed with finding all the objects and cannot compel myself to stop playing!

B000001F76|5.0|For a guy that's been dead more than 50 years, legendary American country singer Hank Williams Sr. sure sells plenty of product. \\"40 Greatest Hits,\\" is somewhere at the top of his pack, and it's not hard to see why. Music is a mechanism for delivering feeling, and Williams surely excelled at that. His work is open and accessible and he worked with the music, and the concerns of ordinary people. Of course, he also wrote most of his own songs, and few have written better; several have become not just country standards, but popular music standards.<br /><br />Williams recorded but 66 songs in his brief career. Of that number, most of his great standards are here. The mournful \\"Your Cheatin' Heart,\\" \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\\"and \\"Your Cold, Cold Heart,\\" all written by him. Also, the rollicking, good time \\"Honky Tonk Blues,\\" \\"Honky Tonkin'\\",\\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou),\\"\\"Move It On Over,\\" and \\"Hey Good Lookin'--\\" Williams wrote a lot of sad songs, but he didn't write only sad songs. There's also another song he wrote that's become a country standard, \\"Ramblin' Man:\\" those country boys sure do love the road. You'll also find on this album a couple of songs written by others: like \\"Lovesick Blues,\\" and \\"Take These Chains from My Heart.\\" They were written by others but received their definitive treatment from Williams, and will always be associated with his work: in fact, most people probably think he wrote these songs, too. If you care for country music, you'll want this album.  And it's a good buy.
0765365278|5.0|This is what I found when reading this 1,000 page + book. Its so long that you spend so much time following the story of say, Kaladin, that I got really really into it. Then when the point of view would shift to Shallan, I would be bummed out. One reason was because the story with Kaladin is so enthralling that you can't help but want to know more. The other reason is that going to another chracters point of view after not reading anything about that character for so long made me forget how good the story was surrounding that character. Then I would remember that story arc is awesome too. Before Brandon Sanderson my only favorite fantasy author was John Marco. I read both his trilogies and the one that came after those sets, Starfinder. But now, I am certainly going to pick up Brandon Sandersons other books. Can't wait for the part of the of this one. And I had no idea The Way Of Kings is going to be a 10 part series! I am so excited now!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|'The Hard Way' is a suspenseful novel with an entertaining plot.  There are some Reacher books where the plot is just over the top and Reacher comes off as too much of a hero. For me, this book was not one of  them.

B008COII1Y|1.0|Exit Humanity is slow as zombies stuck in molasses.  It's kind of an endless loop of the same tone, same scenes, same subpar zombies lumbering towards the protagonist who repeatedly falls on his knees and howls at the sky.  The movie is also punctuated by animated sequences that only serve to further muddy an already muddled movie  There casting/act is weak - as are the sad-sack zombies.  It's neither scary, nor interesting/poetic.  Unless you're in the mood to be very patient and not tremendously entertained, I would suggest you pass.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great app does.what.I wanted it to do. world great on my kindle. I will continue to use this app on the future

Oh well, I took a chance and lost some money. At least this is the last time it'll happen with their cd

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect with this book. I heard all the talk over the movie and wanted to give the book a try. I cracked the first page and before I knew it, i was 2 hours into it and wasn't putting it down for nothing. One of the best books I can say I have honestly read. The series is amazing but of course the first book is the best in my opinion. Its def. a must read book.!!

0756404746|4.0|Sometimes it feels like Patrick Rothfuss is afraid to hurt his characters. Every once in a while he'll give them a slap on the wrist, a little scare, and then life goes jolly on it's way. Then again, I could be bitter after reading the Song of Fire and Ice books where everything that could go wrong did, along with other horrendous acts to add insult to injury before the story falls apart on itself. That's for another review though.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind has a certain Harry Potter flavor to it and the story's pacing is neither rushed nor sluggish. Some reviews are arguing that Kvothe is \\"too perfect.\\" He's not. He is a prodigy with the potential to become a genius but he definitely has his flaws. Intelligent does not mean blessed. Throughout the book, you are kept on your toes and vaguely stressed about Kvothe's... eh, primary grievance (so as not to give away any spoilers) and Rothfuss provides enough twists and turns to make things interesting. You do wonder how Kvothe will get out of this and that, do about so and so, etc. and the solutions he presents are very unique. I guess the reason I give it 4 stars is because I feel like something is missing. What that is exactly, I'm not sure. The writing here isn't pretentious like many fantasy novels and I personally enjoyed Rothfuss' writing \\"voice.\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure why this book is rated 18+. 13+ would make sense as there is no sex, not much language or other such content that could be deemed vulgar. I would recommend this as a light read (in content, not sheer volume) for this book is much like a lunch instead of a hearty dinner. It's filling but it does leave you wanting more.

0399536108|5.0|First off, I am an entrepreneur at heart. I have started several businesses in my lifetime. My last venture resulted in an acquisition by a Fortune 500 company. I agreed to stay on for a two year \\"transistion period\\", and I can tell you that it's been the most miserable career experience of my life. I read this book over the weekend and was immediately reminded of the lifestyle and freedom I gave up. I was also surprised to realize just how quickly you can get entrenched into the whole \\"sleep walking\\" mindset Chris describes in the book. That's exactly what I have been doing for the past 19 months, and it's time to wake up. If you have even the slightest notion that you want to start a business, than you simply MUST read this book. If you're not 100% convinced it's the right thing to do after reading this, then it's probably not. As Chris says in the book, \\"Come join the living world, the rest of us are waiting.\\"

1603427244|5.0|I knit lace almost exclusively, but often venture out into other projects and have become bored with the standard cast-on and bind-offs.  This book includes a variety of techniques for all sorts of projects, including those pesky rib bind-offs.  I was most interested in the decorative and stretchy bind-offs, and wish the book had included a few more of the decorative borders.  That aside, the book is invaluable to me as an intermediate-advanced knitter. Well worth your $11.

B0014NDXGA|5.0|I purchased two Bushnell Tour V2 Rangefinders for my two adult sons . I rarely give gifts to them now that they are married with children.  We don't exchange.  But, this time I wanted something for them & for their enjoyment.  Well, I think I achieved that !  The comments were flowing easily but simply ; \\" I love it, I love my Bushnell Rangefinder Mom \\" !!!! \\"Really \\" ?  I questioned in doubt of them not trying to hurt my feelings.  \\"Yeap, it works great, easy to use, and really was a great gift, your so thoughtful Mom\\" .<br /><br /> So that's all I can say about the Bushnell Tour V2 Standard Edition Golf Laser Rangefinder as a review. I'm thrilled that they love it.  * It arrived on time, and in good packing condition.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe Hollyweird is making a movie of this kind of sick, perversion.  Oprah and others on TV/Entertainment Industry was promoting this book which is why they sold as many as they did. More and more reason to start finding other entertainment than TV and moviegoing.

B007STBUIW|5.0|Growing up, I too remember going to the movies, and then, 2 hours later, never looking at the ocean the same way ever again!  Jaws is, without any doubt, a true classic.  Anyone who has never seen this film, and I can probably count them all on one hand, needs to go out and see it ASAP.  Jaws personified the horror genre and perfected true fear in a film without even seeing the antagonist fully until about halfway through the film [the first half has the audience seeing through the shark's eyes].<br /><br />While I am happy to see this new restored version of the original 1975 classic coming out, I would have preferred to have seen this released as a box set, including all 4 Jaws Movies [Jaws, Jaws 2, Jaws 3-D, and Jaws: The Revenge].  While some may argue that only Jaws 2 was a decent sequel, and many have dissed parts 3 and 4, you cannot deny that all 4 films bought us all back to the theaters to see that shark do what he does best!<br /><br />I know for a fact that I was disappointed by the lack of extras on the releases of Jaws 3 and 4 [just film trailers only], and I would love to see this complete series, much like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, done up as a box set, and done right...FOR THE TRUE FANS!  All films had extras and television specials to get the fans pumped up to go to the cinema, and all of this stuff should have been on a fifth disc in a box set!  Why the movie studios never give the true fans what they truly want is beyond me.  I will still go out and buy this newest restoration of the cult classic, but as for me, I would have loved to see a box set.  Maybe in another 10 years or if the studios decide to reboot this series?
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best game that I have on my kindle, and the best part is that it is free.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found the books engrossing, very hard to put down.  So many books are derivative or even blatant plagiary (Eragon, anyone?) but this was a unique storyline that sucked you in till the very end.  I had borrowed them from Amazon Prime and my local library and was thinking about buying them, so looked at the trilogy thinking that would be a better deal.  The combination is $18.99, while if you bought the 3 books separately they would be $5.99, $5.99 and $5.00 - so a total of $16.98.  ?????  Why would anyone buy it as a trilogy?
B00004ZAZZ|5.0|This is an ultimate collector's item that any Britney fan should have!  With this, you get 3 extra tracks, (Girl In The Mirror, You Got It All, & Heart), which are not included on any US release of the album.  The CD is also 'enhanced' with extra goodies, so that when you insert it into your PC, you get exclusive facts, pictures, Britney Spears Photo Puzzles, an exclusive downloadable screen savor, and the 'Lucky' music video.  The price for this is way cheaper than even the Standard US Version that is sold here on Amazon.  Do yourself a favor and buy this great Special UK Edition CD and enjoy it!

B007Y6OZE0|4.0|Southern California punk-rockers The Offspring are back with their ninth album, Days Go By.  At this point in the band's career, fans probably wonder how much gas is left in the tank.  The core members are now in their mid-to-late forties - not that far away from collecting Social Security checks.  Time has a way of eroding the abilities of even the best performers.  Athletes begin to slow down, actors watch their star power recede, and musicians lose the drive and energy of their glory years.<br /><br />Fortunately, fans needn't worry about a softening of the band's sound or a slackening of the rebellious attitude that is at the heart of every punk-rock outfit.  The Offspring prove they still have plenty of game.  In fact, Days Go By is in the running for the band's best album.  Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />Any concerns about the advancing age of the founding members are quickly put to rest after hearing the bombastic opener \\"The Future Is Now\\".  The song slams into you like a Spanish fighting bull and only lets up briefly during the piano breakdown in the bridge.  Frontman Dexter Holland vents about the dangers of technology as people become increasingly isolated from one another: \\"I sink into the night/And I'm turning off the lights/ `Cause the future is here/ This is how I disappear.\\"  One only needs to walk outside and witness the number of passers-by thumbing their smart phones to appreciate Holland's point.  Hot on its heels is \\"Secrets From the Underground\\", a breathless punk-sounding tune that unleashes the pent-up frustration from the economic stagnation that has gripped the United States.  Kevin `Noodles' Wasserman rips off a searing guitar solo before the final chorus crashes in.  The ending is tightly-focused, with Holland fuming \\"Anger starts a fiiiiiiire!\\" over a medley of pounding percussion and explosive power chords.  Two tracks in and The Offspring sound as good as ever.<br /><br />A breezy guitar hook opens the first single, \\"Days Go By\\".  It's more optimistic than the previous songs, as Holland puts forward a hopeful message that even though times are tough, things can get better.  The song stays firmly in mid-tempo territory throughout its four-minute run time, and while it doesn't measure up to some of the band's previous singles, it's still an enjoyable, easy-going song.  \\"Turning Into You\\" comes in next, propelled by a winding, distorted lead guitar layered over top of a recurring drum loop.  The theme of rebelling against the pressures of conformity will be familiar to fans of punk music, but the track has solid dynamics and energy to spare.  \\"Hurting As One\\" cements itself as the album's best track.  A spine-tingling bridge reminiscent of \\"Gone Away\\" is surrounded by a volley of unadulterated punk fury.  The chorus has equal handfuls of drive and animosity, with precise, chugging riffs and Holland layering the vocals to maximum effect.<br /><br />The middle portion of the record is a mixed bag.  There is a noticeable slowdown as some of the earlier energy begins to evaporate.  First up is the uber-catchy \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\", which is certain to be the most polarizing song on the album.  This is an unapologetically goofy song, similar to previous oddball concoctions like \\"Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\\" and \\"Don't Pick It Up\\".  The rapping verses and party-themed lyrics just reinforce the fact that these guys don't take themselves too seriously.  The band adopts a more serious tone on the keyboard-driven \\"All I Have Left Is You\\".  At first I didn't care much for this track - the understated nature of the song makes it easy to overlook.  It takes its time building up to the soaring finale, with Holland reflecting on two lovers holding onto each other in a storm.  The song feels very different from the material around it - quiet, introspective - but it rises up with a grand chorus at just the right time to hold your attention.  It's distinctive without being boring.  Speaking of distinctive, \\"OC Guns\\" is, quite simply, bizarre.  The song is essentially a shotgun marriage between two disparate musical styles: reggae and mariachi, with some scattered Spanish lyrics thrown in for good measure.  The end product is a weird hybrid of both styles and will likely leave most listeners scratching their heads.<br /><br />After a so-so middle section, the album begins to pick up steam as it marches to a conclusion.  \\"Dirty Magic\\" is a re-worked version of the same song from the band's second album, \\"Ignition\\" (1992).  Holland claims the band recorded the original in only three hours and they wanted to go back and put a fresh coat of paint on it.  The improved production values don't diminish the dark, haunting tone that pervades the song.  The lyrics, which focus on drug abuse and self-destruction, are creepy but well-written, and the instrumentation is biting and aggressive.  \\"I Want A Secret Family (With You)\\" has a catchy opening hook, but settles for merely being adequate as the chorus never quite sticks.  The album ends on a high note with the dual tandem of \\"Dividing By Zero\\" and \\"Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell\\".  They sound like something The Offspring would have recorded on Ignition or Smash (1994).  Both are speedy punk-rockers that get the blood pumping and provide an emphatic statement that the band is far from done.<br /><br />Ultimately, Days Go By finds the band in top form.  The SoCal boys deliver alternating blasts of edgy punk-rock and off-the-wall zaniness with their usual flair for the dramatic.  Despite their advancing seniority, they are determined not to go quietly into that good night.  The Offspring have managed to pound out another rock-solid disc that is sure to satisfy both old and new fans alike.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Okay I gave Mrs. James her props on the first two books.  But this last book was a waste of my money and my time.  Several times throughout the book I almost stopped reading but figured I had already invested in two books so why not finish the third.  Well it took me five weeks to finish and I really didn't finish because I finally got to 90%  and couldn't take any more.  It was like in this book she really ran out of things to write so she basically threw together a story.  I felt it was rushed and not thought out at all.  Not to mention after watching Twilight last week I realized I was actually reading a story about Bella and Edward except with sex!  I was disappointed to say the least.  It is really too bad Mrs. James couldn't dream up a story on her own.  First thing in writing - Do not take from material you have read and re-write with add ons.  She had me with book one and two but totally lost me here.

B005LAIGN2|2.0|2-stars for being a poor, but not un-watchable, aerial combat movie. I was strongly tempted to deduct a star for bad treatment of Tuskegee Airmen's story, but that didn't seem fair since Hollywood routinely ignores the compelling elements of a story in favor of a distorted, hackneyed,formulaic treatment.<br /><br />1. Failure as an aerial combat movie:<br />Anyone who has seen even a modest amount of actual WW2 aerial combat footage will alternate between a series of negative emotions: derisive laughter, groaning, and anger at being treated so contemptuously by this movie's makers. The CGI is heavily influenced by the style and technique of first-person-shooter videogames, but it is so over-the-top visually that any serious gamer would reject it as cartoonish -- lacking any sense of realism. Particularly absurd, the movie treats steel, including armor plating, as having the same explosive potential as vaporized gasoline -- one .50-cal bullet hits it and there is a towering fireball. And the tactics swing between nonsense and hilariously stupidity (but one should know not to expect better from George Lucas).<br /><br />The only faintly realistic part of the movie is that it treats the Germans as the same cartoonish, wooden villains as did the propaganda comic books of that era.<br /><br />2. Failure as a story of the Tuskegee Airmen:<br /><br />The movie fails to give any sense of the importance of their accomplishments (instead citing medals). The movie shows a bomber crew offering to buy drinks for some Red Tails, as a casual &#34;nice job&#34; acknowledgement. This trivializes what happened. The Red Tails so excelled as escorts that bomber groups lobbied hard to have them assigned to their missions. And their reputation became such that their mere presence produced a substantial boost to the morale of the bomber crews. Without effective fighter escort, the bombing campaign would have been severely limited -- the costs of many targets would have been prohibitive. The movie presents the Red Tails as reducing the number of bomber crews killed, instead of them enabling those bombers to deliver heavy blows to the German war machine.<br /><br />The challenges the Tuskegee Airmen faced are only lightly touched upon: With only a few trivial modifications to the script, this movie could have had an all-white cast. The biggest failing is that the movie gives no sense of how this experience turned the elite of the Negro community -- many of the pilots qualified for the military program because of pilot training in a civilian program at Tuskegee University -- into part of the elite of American society. What the movie shows is generic &#34;frat boy&#34; behavior, but when you listen to the accounts of the actual pilots what you hear is how aware they were of the importance of what they were doing and the disastrous effects if they failed. And of the habits of focus, discipline and toughness it reinforced that served them so well later.<br /><br />The movie lacks any of the foreshadowing of the important people that many of these pilots would become. The DVD's extras include interviews with some of the airmen, but I didn't notice it covering anything I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Plus, &#34;extras&#34; are supposed to be that, rather than (partially) remedial for the failings of the primary product (the feature movie).<br /><br />-- Douglas B.

0345495004|3.0|Found this tale of the life of Mamah Borthwick Cheney, mistress to Frank Lloyd Wright, disappointing.  Is it a human thing to expect extraordinary lives to be lived by extraordinary people, or just an American thing?  As portrayed by author, Mamah never feels remotely extraordinary.  She's a woman who was willing to defy some social taboos (leaving husband for lover) but not others (continues to insist she's dedicated to her children ... though she doesn't attempt to see them for years at a time); she graduates from college (not common for women at turn of the century) but never really does anything with her degree/learning; she rubs shoulders with radical thinkers (Ellen Keyes, Goethe) but never adds anything meaningful to these movements; and she spends years in an intimate relationship with Wright without ever having any noticeable impact on his philosophy or art.  Pretty much all that distinguishes her is her rather spectacular death at the end.  (Not a spoiler - don't most bios end in death?)  Note that I said \\"as portrayed by the author,\\" because we can't really know if Mamah was this uninteresting - that's just how Nancy Horan depicts her.  A part of me wonders to what extend Mamah's true \\"radicalism\\" is blunted by Horan's desire to portray her as a sympathetic figure.  If this had been an autobiography rather than a biography, would we have liked Mamah less but admired her more?<br /><br />Another major disappointment is what I call the \\"evening news effect.\\"  Due to the limited amount of primary source info avail (Horan stipulates just how little in an important endnote), Horan has attempted to flesh out the story by dumping everything she turned up in the course of her research into the story, no matter how irrelevant.  Thus we have to sit through scenes, pages, chapters of information (She planted a garden!  Her daughter was constipated on the train to Colorado!) that neither add to the story or our understanding of Mamah's character.<br /><br />Perhaps the most distracting flaw (for me), however, was the lack of insight that the book provides into Frank Lloyd Wright's career.  Sadly, Borthwick's life intersected the famous architects' during what were probably the most fallow years of his career - after his vision was already shaped but before he began building some of his most spectacular edifices.  We end up learning more about Wright's sideline buying and selling Japanese prints than we do of his architectural career.  As depicted by the author, Wright comes off as rather whiny, spoiled, and overbearing ... but, again, to what extent is this perception shaped by the intent and/or prose of the author?  There's no way to know.<br /><br />Ultimately, found myself resenting the fact that so many extraordinary opportunities (wealthy, educated, travelled the world, hobnobbed with influential people) were seemingly wasted on such an ordinary woman. Would have been a much more exciting life, not to mention a much more exciting book, if Mamah had taken more advantage of the opportunities that her life afforded her.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|After the rather ambient and experimental \\"A Thousand Suns\\" which had not a few scratching their heads in bewilderment, Linkin Park return to the bold brash sound that shifted millions of units earlier in their career. Fans of their Rock/Rap style will heave a sigh of relief, right from opening cut \\"Lost In The Echo\\" with Mike Shinoda laying some hard hitting rhymes and Chester Bennington screaming like a banshee. It's no \\"Meteora\\" or \\"Hybrid Theory\\" but then the band have matured and trodden different musical paths since then.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Burn It Down\\" is set to stomping beats with lyrics alluding to battle. \\"I'll Be Gone\\" features the lyrics \\"Let the sun fade out and another one rise, I'll be gone\\", while \\"Castle Of Glass\\" is a catchy bouncy tune belying the dark nature of the lyrics.\\"Victimized\\" finds Drummer Rob Bourdon working overtime. The lovely ballad \\"Roads Untraveled\\" finds Bennington singing \\"The love that you lost isn't worth what it cost and in time you'll be glad that it's gone.\\"<br /><br />The band still find time to experiment on the quirky \\"Skin To Bone\\" (with swirling effects - my favourite) and the tempo-shifting reverb-laden \\"Until It Breaks\\" with some Dub Step touches and lovely harmonies. \\"Tinfoil\\" is a brief ambient instrumental, which segues into closing song, the haunting ballad \\"Powerless\\" with the vulnerable lines \\"You held it all, but you were careless to let it fall...I was by your side, powerless\\".<br /><br />This album strikes the right balance between the experimental and the familiar. They still sound like a band raging for battle, but also one in touch with their humanity and feelings.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|When I listen to this cd, I get the same feeling I got when listening to the latest Van Halen release... what's wrong with my ears? Are they full of wax, hair, or am I just getting old (I'm 42)and losing my hearing? (It might be all of the above!)In the past, albums by Rush, Van Halen, and many others were characterized by a sound quality where every instrument could be distinctly heard crisply and clearly. Even if the song wasn't that good, the quality of the sound was still pleasurable. There was a \\"space\\" between the instruments that made every sound important and allowed the music to \\"breathe\\". So I went back and listened to some Hemispheres and Moving Pictures to see if it was my problem... Nope, nothing wrong with my ears, the sound is still as crisp and clear as ever! So it's something going on with albums made recently which causes all the instruments to either \\"blend in\\" with each other, or in some cases \\"cancel each other out\\"... at least that's what I hear on this cd.<br /><br />This album would be amazing if 1) the sound quality/production/engineering (or whatever it is) we're fixed so you could hear distinctly all the amazing musicianship going on in these epic songs, and 2) the guitar solo on \\"Clockwork Angels\\" didn't degenerate at the end into an unlistenable section of music and garbled vocals. Aside from these things, this album is a classic \\"Post- Signals\\" album. At least it will sound better Live!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|All though the YA market has been growing larger and larger I still find myself coming back to Percy Jackson.<br />With a cast of demigod characters this book remains one of my favorites.
B007V508CC|5.0|Neither will I...<br /><br />OK... This is just a pop record.<br />Some people suggest that means it was created purely for financial gain. I submit that it means it was created purely for fun, because that's what it's like listening to it.<br />Hey, I like a decadently rich gourmet chocolate as much as anybody. But sometimes...I just want a Starburst jelly bean!<br />It is summertime people... lighten-up!
B007V508CC|4.0|Maroon 5's \\"Moves Like Jagger\\", an ultra catchy Disco/Pop smash breathed new life into the band. Their new album \\"Overexposed\\" revisits the disco quite a few times and despite trying hard to be likeable, falls slightly short of catchy tunes.<br /><br />Opening is the reggae-ish \\"One More Night\\", followed by \\"Payphone\\" with martial beats, quietly pulsing synths, and a highly unnecessary rap by Wiz Khalifa. \\"Daylight\\" is nice mid tempo guitar Pop a la U2/Coldplay, while following is the propulsive thumping \\"Lucky Strike\\" with buzzing synths, a highlight. Other standouts are the groovy \\"Lady Killer\\" (with a nice falsetto-sung chorus), the spare piano ballad \\"Sad\\", and the stomping pair of \\"Tickets\\" and \\"Doin' Dirt\\" (both with a Euro Disco feel). Closing is the absolutely gorgeous pulsing ballad \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" with Adam Levine giving a soothing emotive performance - this wouldn't sound out of place on any of their earlier albums.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are disappointing really, especially \\"Wipe Your Eyes\\", which despite featuring an interesting Amadou and Mariam sample just goes nowhere. Much better is the cover of Prince's \\"Kiss\\" which is redone as swinging Blues, features a fab lengthy guitar solo, and is rather fun.<br /><br />A motley collection it might be, but not bad at all.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love! Love! Love, this book! I know I truly love a book when I just can't stop thinking about the characters. I find myself thinking about them all day (especially Travis - wink) and searching for any spare minute in the day so I can sneak a quick read. I feel like an addict! In fact, I loved it so much that as soon as I finished I started again. Such a great book!
0307950689|3.0|The concept was interesting, and Dan Brown does a good job in sharing Langdon's views on Masonic orders.  But, the characters were like cardboard cutouts.  I could live with that, if the pacing had been fast (as in Da Vinci Code).  Unfortunately, the plot gets bogged down in elaborate description.  Then, once through the descriptive quagmire, the threads of the plot tended to resolve in a cliche manner.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book, even though it wasn't Dan Brown's best work to date.

030799077X|5.0|I am not a fan of Toni Morrison - however I found this book very good. Frank returning from the war - and the trials and troubles his finds on his way home; you really need to read this book to find out what happens to Frank.
0060987464|5.0|Being a fan of Marilyn Manson, I quickly bought a copy of this book as soon as a found out it was available. This novel provided me with what I wanted...insight into Mr. Manson's psych. I wanted to know about his childhood, his introduction into the music industry, his personal life, and what exactly made him become one of the most controversial entertainers of all time. \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" provided me with all of the information I sought, and so much more. I feel any Manson fan would appreciate this novel and enjoy the contents within. I would not, however, recommend this book to anyone who already has a strong dislike for Manson or expects to find a \\"Happy Story\\" life behind the facade of the shock rocker. His life is no fairy tale, and this book is in no way sugar coated. So if you're easily offended, steer clear...If you honestly want to have an insight into this man's life, I highly recommend buying it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A different kind of story... Love it'. I am in my early 30's and although this is supposed to be a teen novel, I loved it as well.

B007V508CC|5.0|This album is what the people want to listen to. I agree it's nothing like \\"song about Jane\\" or \\"it won't be soon before long\\" but it's an improvement to hands all over. It's more streamlined \\"obviously\\", which there is nothing wrong with. Songs like \\"lucky strike\\" and \\"one more night\\" set the tone of the album.<br /><br />I'm sure Maroon 5 will go back to their roots but this is an improvement to \\"hands all over\\".<br />Rating it below 3 stars is an insult to Maroon 5.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Excellent game. Is just what it says it is. Very relaxing. Interface is simple. Wish it came with more puzzles without having to purchase more.
B001S49AQW|3.0|This is a type of Heyer I don't care for as much as some others--a desperately in love, younger girl winds up married to an older, more worldly man and gets herself into trouble trying to be the wife she thinks he wants. In this instance it is mitigated by the husband having a group of particularly engaging friends who bring him to his senses. And I love the trope of the eccentric grandma to whom wayward women can be brought in an emergency.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I think I can pretty much say that I adore Lauren Oliver's writing. First, Before I Fall and now Delirium. I need to read the sequel like yesterday. To me, Oliver has a very poetic style of writing. I don't know if that's the right word, but it flows so well and it is somewhat elegant. Plus, both of her books that I have read were emotionally heavy. They sat with me for a very long time.<br /><br />I also enjoy that Oliver really tries to have all of her characters have flaws. It can get kind of tiring reading about perfect characters, but you won't really find that in Delirium... and it's awesome. I am really anxious to see what some of my favorite characters are up to in Pandemonium. I should say anxious/scared. You'll understand what I'm saying once you finish it.<br /><br />I feel like this review is super short, but I'm finding it really hard to say much without giving everything away. I'll leave it at awesome character development, fabulous world building, and beautiful writing.<br /><br />I probably don't need to tell you this, but you should read this book now. Warning: The ending is KILLER.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden objects like this. This one really cool because the storylone is fanstastic as well as the game of finding the objects. cool game and anyone will love this game.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I wandered upon this audiobook and was blown away! I listened to this book twice in a row, which doesn't happen often. This is, in fact, the first review that I have ever written for a book and I can't recommend it enough. The book is conceptual, so if you're looking for a 10 step system for becoming a professional at your chosen career, this is not your book. I just ordered his latest book on Becoming a Pro...I imagine that this book has more \\"Do this, do that\\" advice, but I have not yet read it. I was really pleasantly surprised by this book, it REALLY blew me away.
B0086700CM|5.0|i was sooo excited whe  it came on kindle fire bty its a great game and not too easy and not to hard
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked this book much better than 50 Shades, for 2 main reasons... 1.) Day is a much more polished writer than James and it is apparent after the first few pages; 2) Gideon is hot and intense but seems much more mature than Christian. Bared to You is less Twilight-y, if that makes sense. I can't wait for the sequel in October!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I wanted to protect my Kindle Fire so I purchased this cover and it has worked out great.  It offers the protection I need for my Kindle and it has a neat stand to sit the Kindle up horizontally if you want to watch videos. A great buy!
B005SLS3ZU|5.0|Originally purchased this item from the local library but had to return it before I had finished, so purchased from Amazon, as I just couldn't put it down. Great plot, flowing writing, characters realistic and all round a great read. I am certainly a fan of Michael Connelly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a really good story for a smut book. I thought the explicit variations were enthralling, and it kept me reading. Not normally the type of book I would pick up, but it began one way and ended another. I really enjoyed this trilogy. Is a JR.R Tolkien? Or JK Rowling? Or ....Bukowski? NO! For the genre it's in, it serve's it purpose. I enjoyed the suspense very much. Sure it could use some polishing here and there...over all I'm glad I read it.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I almost didn't go see this movie at the theater because of the horrible advertising, but I am so glad that my desire to revisit the stories of my youth triumphed, because I actually saw it a couple more times in the theater (a rarity for me).<br /><br />This movie is very much done in the vein of the original and most of the artistic license (the addition and subsequent death of a family for example) only serve to build out the character in my opinion.  This is still a faithful recreation of pulp fiction, so don't expect deep, but the story is well constructed with a decent pace and structure.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  With this coming out in the same timeframe as the new Avengers movie, I find myself asking how we can make Tharks that look completely realistic (well for a fictional Martian race at least), and the Hulk still looks like a cartoon character (though he is much better in the latest iteration), which just shows the strength of CG team?  I loved the style of the production design and it felt true to the original vision of Burroughs.<br /><br />For me, this is one of the better movies of the last couple of years for just sheer enjoyment.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|highly recommend it. get paid version which is more levels and more challenging. time passes you by before you ever realize it.
0345803485|1.0|I have no desire to finish reading the first book. Really mad I spent $30 on the trilogy! Wish I could get my money back.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was interesting but I was expecting more.  1st book awesome/great.  2nd book really good.  3rd book okay.  Too much closure.  If you wanted everything wrapped up at the end  with a nice bow this is your book.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Been a fan of Anthrax since the 80s.  Spreading the Disease is probably still my favorite album of theirs.  Joey's voice is what made them stand out for me, and what made them unique amongst the Big 4.  A metal band that had a real (call it classic if you want) metal singer, instead of growler, screamer, or whatever else.  I'll give Hetfield credit where it's due, his voice is unique, and the man can (could?) sing.  Araya was Araya obviously, and was good for what it was.  I love Megadeth, and Mustaine's voice was also awesome and unique.  But Belladonna's voice really won out for me when it came to the Big 4.<br /><br />With that backstory out of the way, I was really bummed out back when they originally threw Joey Belladonna out of the band.  I really wondered how Bush was going to sound with them, and then I heard Only.  And I wanted to like it more than I actually did.  I bought the album.  Enjoyed it for what it was.  But Anthrax now sounded like a heavy grunge act to me.  It felt like they were trying to blend with what was cool and trendy and no longer being themselves.  I never bought another Anthrax album with Bush on it.  I just never liked them at all with Bush.  I know there is lots of love for the guy in these reviews, and he deserves credit where it's due for his vocals, but his strainy over-grainy style was never my thing, and it turned me off to Anthrax permanently.<br /><br />There was quite a lot of lineup drama in Anthrax in recent years, and I always hoped they'd get it together and be able to work with Joey again.<br /><br />Worship Music really seems to have made the 20 or so years without Joey worth the wait.  His vocal performance is even more classic metal than ever before.  There are even hints of Dickenson in the performances when he hits the lower registers.  The writing, performance, and everything else on this album are top notch.  It's not even a nostalgic coolness, like a lot of comeback albums are.  This seriously stands on it's ownas one of my favorite Anthrax albums.  And I'm pretty sure that overall, it tops Euphoria and Persistence on my favorite albums list.<br /><br />I'm genuinely excited to see what's in store for the future with Anthrax.<br /><br />Oh, and worth mentioning, is Rob Caggiano's guitar playing.  Growing up, Danny Spitz was in my top 2 or 3 guitar players.  His solos always had such quirky style and personality.  So I was very skeptical about how much I'd really like Caggiano's lead playing.  But I love his lead style.  I will admit that in any case he seems to be a smoother and polished player, but not in a boring way.  Sometimes during his leads I'll get a little taste of what I think Spitz might have done himself.  I just felt this was worth mentioning, as it's the only piece of the \\"classic\\" lineup not in place, but I really don't think Anthrax suffers for it, in fact, it's an improvement.
B007Y6OZE0|3.0|\\"Days Go By\\" has some of the absolute worst mastering I've ever heard on a CD (and that is saying a lot, considering nearly all new CDs are victims of the loudness wars).  It has ABSOLUTELY ZERO DYNAMICS (all the same volume; no difference between soft and loud parts) and has lots of clipping and distortion.  At times, the drums sound like someone lightly tapping on paper. The album sounds as if The Offspring are performing inside of a cardboard box and you are in the box with them.  That said, the album does have some great songs, several of which sound very much like old school Offspring (i.e. \\"Turning Into You,\\" \\"Hurting As One\\"). In fact, \\"Dirty Magic\\" is a remake from the classic \\"Ignition\\" album.  The band pokes fun at current trendy pop songs with the song \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\" and manages to create a fun, catchy song reminiscent of \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy).\\"  Unfortunately, \\"Days Go By\\" also has its share of skip-worthy tracks (\\"All I Have Left Is You,\\" \\"O.C Guns,\\" \\"I Wanna Secret Family (With You)\\") that feature uninspired lyrics and uninspired melodies.<br /><br />In short, we are left with an album of about 9 good to great tracks, and 3 throwaway tracks.  This album could have been great with a few more strong tracks, minus the aforementioned weak tracks, and without the abominable mastering job. Instead, the mastering and bad tracks get in the way of one's enjoyment of the good tracks, making this one of The Offspring's weakest efforts (but still worth hearing if you're a longtime fan).
B002VWNID6|3.0|I must say that I have always loved this movie.  Yes it's got really BAD acting by Costner (and what's up with the hair?!) but Alan Rickman steals the show anyway.<br /><br />The movie stopped half way thru as others have said.  Nothing left on dvd.  But I had already tried 2 copies from the $5 bin at Walmart and they did the same thing.  Walmart refunded my money easily both times.  I was surprised when the copy from amazon was the same.  Amazon refunded my money easily also.  Must be a bad lot.  Never run across that before.

1451627289|4.0|This is another one of King's later-in-life very long books that feels a tad too long. And yet having read it, I can't quite put my finger on what could have been removed to give it a little more brevity.<br /><br />The first third of the novel sees our time-traveling protagonist changing minor-to-medium events in order to study their impact on the future via the Butterfly Effect. If you're reading this wanting to get right to King addressing the assassination of JFK, these chapters are probably the ones you would say could go, but they're so necessary, so integral to our character's (another Jake!) drive to do the right thing.<br /><br />The book has many King tropes like the sanctified mental defect, the mysterious man in strange colored coat and fedora, the Whedonesque take on happy romances... but the one that has annoyed me the most for decades--the blunt foreshadow (\\"And that was the last time Ben saw Susan alive\\") is not lingering around anywhere in this tale.<br /><br />My primary gripe: King paints a very stereotyped, harshly negative caricature of the poverty-level American throughout this book that was mildly offensive to me. Not every poor neighborhood is filled with unattended children, men who beat their wives, wives who sell their sex to make ends meet, etc. but to read this, it often seems that way.<br /><br />This novel has a really interesting King take on time travel, unlike what he's used in the Tower, that you absolutely must read the entirety of the novel to grasp--because what Jake thinks is the answer to predestination and the time traveler time paradox is rudely taken from him for the reality of another quite late in the game.<br /><br />It ends on a note bittersweet. A very \\"there are other worlds than these\\" note. I enjoyed the book; it was always fairly solid, never a compelling page-turner. B/B-<br /><br />Other King work cameos/echoes:<br />A couple key locations in Derry from It as well as Bev and Richie, appear in the early portion ofthe book. The protagonist of this novel even begins to write a fiction novel based on the Derry murders.<br /><br />The make believe Japanese car make/model noted in both Wizard and Glass and The Stand is a part of this world as well, suggesting it's another book set in that universe.<br /><br />The same red and white Plymouth Fury as Christine is present in this book and is a herald of dark events.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|As with many of this style of game things can be vague. ex: a Clarinet is called a Flute &amp; Wraped items include books, bags, twined items, and not something wrapped in paper. If the game proceeds along these lines it will become rather annoying and hint filled.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|- Disks were in perfect condition. The package was unopened and blah-blah-blah.<br />- The show itself was excellent. I like the majority of the characters and their development. It's complex enough to keep you thinking but it doesn't get too crazy. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the fantasy realm.

B00846REIS|3.0|Sylvia Day's story of two damaged lovers was a disappointment.<br />Sylvia fire your editor.The ending was too abrupt and left too many holes in the story, it made me think pages were left out of my Kindle.<br />Important themes were left hanging, the story seriously lacked character development<br />Sylvia could have given more information about the characters past history and that would not have made the bump and grind any less fun to read.<br />I got it that Eva gets hurt and runs that happened repeatedly and although not difficult to understand considering her past, I felt at 24 years old it is immature to repeatedly run off when the going gets tough. Cory's Baby girl pet name used so frequently gave me diabetes.<br />We learn more about Gideon through Magdalene and Corinne. The jealous ex-girlfriends theme has been done.<br />So many story lines were touched upon and then dropped, i.e.  Gideon's visit to the psychiatrist, her father, Cory filming Magdalene and Christopher, what is with Gideon's type being dark haired women until Eva comes along and  what is with the parents?<br />Jet setting across the country to meet her father would have been a thought, a chance meeting with his parents might have helped fill out Gideon's family connection. More interaction with the evil stepbrothers might have clued us in on the two main characters problems. How about Eva using her martial arts training to blast the horn dog in the foursome instead of being rescued?<br />Gideon's sexual abuse history was completely glossed over and the source of his torment never truly revealed. This was a major problem for the couple in the story and all they kept promising themselves was that they would work it out. Did I mention lots of important information was not touched on and left me wondering if I had an unfinished book.
1400069289|5.0|Early on while listening to this audiobook, I was ready to eject the disc and forget the whole thing. The content was shaping up to be just another business book on how to maximize profits. Take the story of Claude C. Hopkins for example. He was an American businessman and advertising pioneer who applied the science of habits towards helping clients sell products. Active in the early 20th century, Mr. Hopkins is credited with promoting daily teeth brushing by showing that doing so would remove a film that forms naturally on the teeth. Never mind that brushing was overkill (swishing water in your mouth will do the job), people nevertheless bought into the new habit, and millions of dollars were made. Ahh, advertising.<br /><br />In spite of celebrating the likes of Claude C. Hopkins, I kept listening. After a while I got the impression of a Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. For the most part, this book wants to be a statistical how-to manual for reforming individuals and businesses, but underneath all the rationality lurks a dark side. It's one thing to bite your nails and wish you could stop, but it's another thing entirely to wield the power of habit to manipulate others. More on this in a moment.<br /><br />The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg breaks down the structure of a habit into three parts: cue, action and reward. He goes on to show how it's overwhelmingly easier to alter a habit rather than cease doing it entirely. For the bad habits, one need only change the destructive part of the habit, the action, and keep the other parts intact. This works provided an appropriate substitute is found.<br /><br />The most influential parts for me were the sections on small winds and weak ties. Small winds are like a controlled butterfly effect -- small changes leveraged in the present so that bigger changes can be enacted later on. Weak ties relate to the relational bonds between people. There are family and friends and there are complete strangers, and somewhere in between are the weak ties. A surprisingly strong connection, these are the people you may know of, but not very well. Or you may not know them at all even though they belong to your community, church, etc. Movements are born and political campaigns are won using these weak ties.<br /><br />The section on corporate retailers (Target being the given example) takes us to more uncomfortable territory. Here they mine consumer buying data to predict a customer's future buying needs. Hardly innocuous coupon advertising; this is big brother stuff, and to the book's credit, it admits the same thing. Profits are up! But so are intrusions of privacy! (Jekyll and Hyde.) We all know this is going on, but to what extent?<br /><br />The last section ventures into the territory of habit versus free will with biting examples of gambling addiction and committing involuntary manslaughter... while asleep! This isn't your feel good biz org manual anymore. It's this dichotomy that seals the deal for The Power of Habit being one of the most important reads this year.en are the weak ties.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I bought this CD this morning, since then, I have listened to it 3 times in a row.  This CD is right up there with Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and if you're a true Linkin Park fan you will not be disappointed.  I've been a fan since the beginning, started swaying away with the last CD, A Thousand Suns, but this CD has brought me back around. Highly recommend this title.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome I so far in this game u need to try it is super fun its cool
B0067AC5KA|2.0|Please do not waste your time.  There are so many books in the world worthy of your eyes.  Don't be drawn in by this tiresome nonsense.  Should you make the mistake of starting these books, be aware that your initial impression of the first book -- that's it's very slow with atmospheric detail standing in place of compelling character or plot development -- is completely correct.  The story and the writing never get any better.  The style continues to be cloying throughout.  Stay away.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|So far, I'm fairly enjoying this game. But I do have one note, stop me if I'm being a pain, but as I was playing one if the objects to find was a flute. There was no flute in the level anywhere. The &quot;answer&quot; was a clarinet. I don't mean to be a pain, but maybe clear things up there? Clarinets are way different from flutes
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is much easier to navigate than Quick Office HD.  I use Microsoft Office at work on my desktop computer and love the idea that I don't have to come home and re-learn how to use a word processor in my off-work time.  I can just sit down and start typing and get finished with my task in a reasonable amount of time.  It is also very functional using a Russian keyboard.  I like the flexibility of this app better than Quick Office HD, too.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing about this \\"book\\" nonstop (I am a stylist at a salon, all we do is talk trash all day), I decided against my better judgement to give it a whirl. \\"Oh my!\\", it was effing terrible! I got a little over half way through and felt like my brain was seeping out of my ears and had to stop. I don't care if I have nothing to add to the grey conversation taking place around me, I refuse to torture myself any further. To the women who find this particular piece of writing a masterpiece: I urge you to ask your partner for a spanking, or flogging for that matter, and save yourself the impending depletion of brain cells. No amount of horniness could EVER make me pick up this book again.

0441013597|5.0|So I had heard about this book from my father when I was younger but didn't know if I'd actually like it even though I'm a huge fan of sci-fi/fantasy novels. The concept of a desert with sand worms just reminded me of the movie Tremors and the last thing I wanted to do was read the novel version of that terrible movie, boy was I wrong. Dune is an epic novel that tells the story of Paul (later Muad-Dib) who aspires to overthrow an evil Baron for a treacherous plot against his family.<br /><br />Almost from the instant I started reading I began noticing obvious similarities between Dune and the Star Wars franchise (I'm a huge fan of BOTH). Arrakis is similar to Tatooine and has indigenous inhabitants who remind me a bit of the Sandpeople...only much more bad ass! Paul has been taught many tricks by his mother and father to help him become a strong leader. His mother in particular is a Bene Gesserit, a band of people that are like a cross between the Jedi and the Genoharadan (for KOTOR fans)..only much less bad ass, and Paul appears to have skills beyond the dreams of either of his parents. I could count the many other ways I was reminded of Star Wars (crysknife/lightsaber) but that's not the purpose of this review.<br /><br />The fact that this novel has inspired so many important pieces of work has proven that the world that Frank Herbert created is a masterpiece of human imagination that successfully made the leap from mind to paper without being an unintelligible jumble like so many novels in the genre become. I recommend Dune to anyone who loves sci-fi or fantasy. I also assure you that yes, it is possible to love Dune and to love Star Wars. It may seem like a daunting book at first (too me 2 weeks to force myself to move past the first chapter) but if you give it a chance it will take you on a journey to a land that you won't soon forget!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|After twenty-years, this timeless Disney classic is still a beautiful film to watch and the special features on the two-disc DVD set make it even better.  Just like Bambi, I really enjoy watching the behind the scenes documentaries and learning about the creative process that goes on with the masters of Walt Disney magic: from the collaboration of a gifted writer and team of animators, to the award winning voice talents of legendary actors like Angela Lansbury, along with the innocent and soothing voices of Paige O'Hara who plays Belle and Robby Benson, best known for his voice over work on the animated TV series The Legend of Prince Valiant whom of course lends his talents to the heart and soul of the Beast.  One of my favorite behind the scenes segments on the DVD was \\"Composing a Classic\\" which involves a meeting with the film's composer Alan Menken taking a memorable look back at the process of creating a fitting musical score for the film while working alongside executive producer, the late Howard Ashman, whom was intensely involved in monitoring songs among other aspects of the project.  Sadly, Howard Ashman passed away just shy of the film's groundbreaking release, Beauty and the Beast would forever be remembered as his last film.<br /> The special edition DVD also has an alternate beginning that was originally scrapped early during pre production.  Looking at it now in comparison to the finished product, I can see why the folks at Disney decided to go against the writer's original film plot and redo everything from scratch.  All kidding aside, it was the best decision they could have made at that time.  Watching the movie on DVD with digitally re-mastered picture and sound adds to the magical experience.  I can remember seeing it for the first time with my twin brother and my Dad in the theatre when I was a kid.  Even now after so many years, it's still an absolute joy to watch.  Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that people of all ages will enjoy.The film brings to light an important message about love and acceptance.  There are those few moments in life where people have to realize that it's okay to let someone into your heart even if they're completely different from the rest of us.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|the game is pretty easy to grasp and really easy to understand. it has very nice graphics as well. great to occupy time with.

1468161660|4.0|Layken, her nine-year old brother Kel, and their mom, have just arrived in Michigan after driving there from Texas.  Within a few moments her brother has made a friend, Caulder, who is also nine, and they begin playing zombies.  Layken gets out of the U-Haul to join the kids when she sets eyes on Will, Caulder's older brother.<br /><br />It turns out that Will and Caulder live right across the street.  Will and Layken find themselves drawn to one another and they don't waste any time going on a first date.  Will takes Layken to a slam, where Layken pretty much gets blown away by the people performing their poetry and she convinces Will to slam as well.<br /><br />Things are going great for them, until something happens in which they realize that it would be impossible for them to be together.  Feelings are hurt and life moves on as it does.  Will they be able to overcome this obstacle to be together?  Is it something that they are even able to overcome?<br /><br />What's a slam, you ask?  Its poetry, but it's not just reading words.  It's performing them.  Slamming is pretty powerful, just like this book.  This is a young adult book, but it's not like the rest of them.  This book deals with real life problems, and how even when it really sucks, life does go on and you just have to go on with it.<br /><br />I read this book within 24 hours.  It was really well done, and if you choose to read it, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.  There were parts that definitely made me cry (a few times), but I'm going to leave you with a part that made me laugh.  This scene is between Layken and her new friend Nick.<br /><br />\\"Hey, Layken,\\" Nick smiles as he sits in his new spot nearest me.  \\"Got another one for ya.  Wanna hear it?\\"<br /><br />In the past week alone, I've had to endure at least three Chuck Norris jokes a day from Nick.  He incorrectly assumes that since I'm from Texas, I must be obsessed with Walker, Texas Ranger.<br /><br />\\"Sure.\\"  I don't try to deny him this privilege anymore, it doesn't work.<br /><br />\\"Chuck Norris got a g-mail account today.  It's gmail@chucknorris.com.\\"<br /><br />It takes me a second to process.  I'm normally quick with jokes, but my mind has been sluggish lately, and for a good reason.<br /><br />\\"Funny,\\" I reply flatly in order to appease him.<br /><br />\\"Chuck Norris counted to infinity.  Twice.\\"<br /><br />As much as I didn't feel like laughing, I did.  Nick did annoy me quite a bit, but his ignorance was endearing.<br /><br />~Slammed by Colleen Hoover (I can't give you the exact page number, because my Nook is telling me there are 1112 pages in this book, when there are only 314 pages.  Silly Nook.)<br /><br />Go read it.  You won't regret it.  I'm off to read the next one in the series!<br /><br />My Rating: 4 ½ out of 5 stars<br /><br />Happy reading!<br /><br />~Pamvilege anymore, it doesn't work.<br /><br />\\"Chuck Norris got a g-mail account today.

B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. works well on my kindle fire. its my go to for weather updates. I find it accurate and love the 5 day forecast ability.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|The Mercury Living Presence series was legendary for the tremendous quality of its recordings, producing a sound that was treasured by audiophiles and casual listeners alike. Mercury was able to carve out an important niche for itself through its pursuit of recording excellence and its use of slightly lesser known orchestras and soloists than the bigger labels, such as RCA, Columbia, DG, and Decca. In many ways this works in the label's favor, as it was able to produce some of the masterpieces of the repertoire with sound that is unbelievably good, even 50 or more years after the fact.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, this collection is thoughtfully conceived and wonderfully executed. The selections include many 20th century compositions, so that there is little overlap with other boxed sets currently available. I cannot recommend this set highly enough, and would certainly purchase a \\"part II\\" if offered for sale.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Graphics are well done and you can easily ignore the facebook alerts if you wish.  It made time pass easily.  Nice job.
B007IQWQ88|5.0|The set just arrived today and it is an astonishing assemblage of Karajan's work. The set contains all of the DG albums Karajan released on DG during the 1960s, with the exception of the operatic works.<br /><br />The box that contains the set is substantial but also compact. The CDs themselves are in cardboard covers that reproduce the original LP covers. These are grouped into four separate boxes that are within the larger box. The booklet is rich in pictures and contains text in English, German, and French.<br /><br />Since the set just came today, I have only had time to listen to a few of the CDs, but the famous Beethoven 9th sounds superb. During the 1960s Karajan recorded much of the standard repertoire, and this set is very comprehensive. Really a marvelous set, and well worth the money.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It a good find it game.It works good on my bionic wish it had a bit less dialogue but it does allow you to skip it
B0046VRR5A|5.0|This set offers tremendous value for money with some of the classic recordings of the genre offered in a set for one low price. Gould's Goldberg variations, Ma's cello suites, and Ozawa's Carmina Burana, for example, alone are worth the price of the set, yet one also gets 22 other masterpieces. This set would be especially useful for one beginning a collection of classical recordings, as many great masterworks are included.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I was not impressed by 1 or 2. I never saw 3, but we saw this one at the dollar theater and enjoyed it very much. Brad Bird's first live action movie. You can really feel the danger, even in 2-D. Proprioception, I think is the word.
B003UCPEJ2|5.0|I admit to having some trepidation about purchasing this collection based on some reviews that questioned the quality of the set. In the end I ordered it and am very happy that I did so. Although I greatly enjoyed the Mercury Living Presence and the Decca Sound collections, I found this one to be the best of them all, especially for the new collector. Much of the standard repertoire is present in this set, and the packaging, presentation, and quality are all first rate. The book that is included contains much of the original liner notes for these releases, and is helpful and informative.<br /><br />These recordings also represent some of the best recordings of many of these pieces. Many recordings feature Fritz Reiner conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra or Charles Munch with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and both are as good as it gets. RCA was able to produce marvelous sounding albums during the late 1950s and early 1960s, as these releases demonstrate. A wonderful buy and a tremendous collection.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I was expecting interesting. This was awwwwwwwsome! wooooh ooh ooh ooh eee eee eee aah aah aah!\\" I really loved every frame. Andy Serkis should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, but of course, he won't be. The only annoying things were the constant verbal and visual references to the original series. I counted 23 or 24. One or two, to show respect for the source materiel, fine. But, 23? Sheesh! I was also pleased (and I'm sorry if this is a spoiler) that no ape at any time gave in to what must have been an overwhelming urge to throw poop.

I won't say what but, let's just say a straight woman would probably throw it out haha its good for them i'm a straight male. Anyways, i was happy, and i'll be listening to this record for the rest of my life.
B007VYQ6DS|4.0|Of course I had to see this right away. Besides the splendor of seeing chimps in the wild on the big screen, it tells a stunning real-life story of courage and kindness in our primate cousins. Occasional use of time-lapse photography works well to emphasize the aliveness of the jungle. The narration by Tim Allen is hit and miss. It tells the story and is funny in places, but it doesn't let us sit back and realize anything for ourselves. It also often weirdly and distractingly refers to chimps as \\"men,\\" \\"girls,\\" and \\"boys\\" and makes a jarringly gratuitous reference to Home Improvement.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|I'm a bit shocked to see how the reviews are all over the place on this one. It's a compelling sci-fi film with a great ending and some great special effects. Just watch it, you will not regret it.

0307950689|1.0|I am proud to say I have never bought a Dan Brown novel. I always read other people's copies, and in short - I suggest you do the same with this book.<br /><br />A friend borrowed this from the library so I read his borrowed copy quickly before it was due back. In that way there is no official record I read it at all.<br /><br />And a good thing too. The research in this novel is as bad as ever, the plot preposterous and formulaic (All Dan Brown books have the same plot structure - I guess he feels \\"why change a winning formula?\\"). The characters are wooden and lifeless and the action soars across a blank page - a world in which no one but the main characters seem to really exist.<br /><br />Dan Brown sets this novel in Washington DC - which he ought to be more familiar with than the European cities he visited on his bus tour before basing his novels on those (Note to Dan: Next bus tour, remember to look out of the windows and stop chatting with the person next to you). Sadly citizens of Washington suggest otherwise. Seems that Washington geography gets the Dan Brown treatment.<br /><br />A new twist for this book though is the sheer dullness of the story. It is tedious.<br /><br />Brown managed in his earlier books to keep people turning the pages - not entirely legitimately! He is a past master at the cliff hanger chapter end, and the shortest chapters known to man! Those are not really chapters so much as breathing spaces. But in this story the paging turning was a distinct chore. This is really not a fun book to read even for the reader looking for something mindless.<br /><br />The plot ending is in the \\"obvious\\" category. I guessed correctly within the first few chapters (AKA pages), and thereafter was just thinking \\"get on with it\\". The plot is also full of holes (like why Langdon is even necessary in this story - he clearly isn't) or why people would not recognise...well I had better not mention that one in case you want to avoid plot spoilers.<br /><br />Ihave found a huge list of factual errors, and there are going to be hundreds more if I could be bothered to google them. But how sad would that be? :) As usual the biggest piece of fiction in this book is the standard boilerplate statement that it contains some fact in it!<br /><br />As something of an expert in Internet Protocols, the \\"funky format\\" IP address had me cringing like this was Digital Fortress all over again.<br /><br />If Brown cannot get technical details (and he cannot), he should just gloss over the details rather than write cringeworthy wrong ones. In essence, if the Internet Protocol address is not in the format of a released protocol, then its not Interent Protocol, is it?! In which case you would not route to the address in the first place!! And as for the description of traceroute - what he calls some mysterious behaviour is in fact the normal behavior of traceroute when traversing routers that filter ICMP messages. Oh and a serious firewall is just blocked ports - you don't get to see the coding! I could go on but I would get very boring!<br /><br />All this could have been avoided if the narrative had not tried to linger on all these errant details. Just show the hacker working into the night and drinking a lot of coffee and the story would run faster and not be so obviously wrong.<br /><br />He also repeats his folk etymology of \\"sincere\\", using it in the plot - which is sad as the etymology is wrong. Not even disputed - just plain wrong. He also uses a dubious etymology of abracadbra (in this case it is disputed and has no evidence, but could possibly be right - although not the way he spells it. J K Rowling fans will know a better spelling).<br /><br />The ending of the story wraps up with some mystical nonsense which manages to misread and reverse the words he quotes from the Bible. The \\"meat for men\\" passage must be understood in the context of paul *opposing* a mystical interpretation of Christianity. The Corinthians were the ones proposing a mystical interpretation, and Paul says it is wrong!<br /><br />Still it makes a good story ...well no, it doesn't...but I guess he hoped it would.<br /><br />Elsewhere the \\"you are the temple\\" quote in 1 Cor 3.16 refers to the church, not individuals.<br /><br />His history is naff too. The Christian cross was a symbol for Christianity from the earliest times - certainly before the 4th century he asserts. We know it was attested as being a standard symbol for Christianity in the second century, and a reading of Corinthians should leave us in no doubt that it was so in the first century too.<br /><br />The hydrogen explosion suggests he does not understand chemistry either, and the noetics quackery suggests he has some general issues with science.<br /><br />But perhaps the most annoying error of all - for me - was his repeating the old cannard about Columbus proving the world was round! If people had thought the world was flat in the 15th century the portuguese would not have been navigating with the astrolabe to get around Africa would they!<br /><br />And indeed, no one thought it was flat. They did not agree entirely on how large the world was, even though Erastothenes had succesfully measured it nearly 2000 years earlier. Columbus was wrong (but lucky). His estimates for the circumference of the earth were wildly understated, based on a misunderstaning of Marco Polo and other such issues, but perhaps mostly because he believed the story of a shipwrecked Portuguese sailor who claimed to have been blown to land in the west (probably Brazil), and the finding of two dead men of \\"oriental\\" origin in a Kayak in Ireland (probably Inuit who were swept there).<br /><br />A Harvard professor probably should have known this rather than repeating the misinformation of a 19th century French atheist (Letronne) who made up the alternate history for his own antireligious reasons. Dan Brown should really spend a bit more time researching his books if he is going to put in all these educated sounding asides in his stories.<br /><br />On the plus side, I think he got a couple of things right. The history of Cravats was correct (although the folk etymology he puts in the mouth of a past headmaster appears to be his invention. The Croation derivation of Cravat appears to be uncontroversial). Some other fact was correct I think...which is an improvement for Brown as usually the facts are 100% wrong.<br /><br />Anyhow, anyone thinking of reading this - don't unless you do what I did and read a copy that someone else borrowed from the library! The book is even more boring than this meandering review!
B005HEWEN0|2.0|If you like Neelix you will probably like this episode, but if you can't stand him you will hate this episode. Either way it's mediocre at best.<br /><br />Putting aside any bias, objectively this is some of the weakest acting and writing in Voyager. It's an episode that is supposed to elicit heart ache and emotion for victims of a tragic war. It fails to accomplish both of these goals because it's not relate-able and never earns what it trys to evoke with it's sub par script.<br /><br />As for my thoughts....I regret watching all of it. What a waste of time.
1423101502|3.0|Percy Jackson is rather self consciously supposed to be the new Harry Potter Instead of a school of witchcraft and wizardry, we have camp half blood. Instead of witches and wizards we have Greek gods but, this series certainly attempted to copy the formula. The degree to which this was successful depends on how you look at the question. Percy Jackson has succeeded in becoming a best selling series, with film adaptions now appearing. It is certainly a money spinner. It has flashes of humour in the series - more in your face humour than the wonderfully subtle but tongue in cheek humour of J K Rowling - but still funny. The story started well enough, if you excuse the wholesale transplantation of Greek gods to the USA.<br /><br />But really this series would have been better if it had not been so clearly a Harry Potter clone, and probably a trilogy would have been better as I was a bit bored with the concept by the time I got to this book.<br /><br />The story seemed to end a little abruptly and then spend a fair bit of time wrapping up loose ends (and possibly setting up a follow on series). I think a follow on series would be a mistake. An enjoyable and imaginative start became increasingly tired and spun out in this series, and there were a couple of points in this book where I was almsot groaning.<br /><br />The series as a whole was not one I regret reading - I just think it should not have followed the Harry Potter formula, but instead wrapped itself up in 3 books or less.<br /><br />One pedantic point on plurals (and this is *very* pedantic :) ) - We are told that Percy (the narrator) has a mind geared up for ancient Greek. But he calls the winged horses \\"Pegasus\\" (Latin), not \\"Pegasos\\" (Greek), and then gives them the plural \\"Pegasi\\", where the Greek plural of Pegasoi might have been better. That is quite forgiveable, of course, because most people recognise the word as \\"Pegasus\\".<br /><br />What is less forgiveable is his mangling of the plural of Octopus. Octopus *is* Greek, and the nominative plural should be \\"octopodes\\" - A plural form the author uses correctly for \\"cyclopes\\". The English plural \\"octopuses\\" would also be fine, but instead he uses the faux Latin \\"octopi\\" which, as far as I can tell, only means 8 x 3.142.
B005HEW714|5.0|Man I'm so glad I came back to this series after giving up on it. B'Elanna is split into her human and Klingon halves (don't ask me how) and they literally team up and learn how to cope with one another. Is it strange that I find the half n' half B'Elanna more attractive then the human one? Maybe that's a credit to the make up artist, or maybe there's something deeply wrong with me muhuahuhahaha :D
0312944926|1.0|Sometimes, after a hard day's work, all you want to do is sit down in front of the TV with a bowl of Tiramisu and a glass of Ginger Beer and have your mind filled with somethis so mindless that \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" does not do it justice. As long as the explosions are loud and the opposite sex are good looking, then frankly - who cares what its about?<br /><br />That is the niche this book fills. It is probably best in audio format, as it is best not to tax the brain with actually reading the words. But its an enjoyable romp with preposterous special effects written in set in a fantasy world that only vaguely resembles ours in terms of geography, history or logic.<br /><br />The plot centres around the idea that - given enough computer power and clever programmers - all encryption can be broken. That is a plot somewhat akin to those plots where people accelerate to light speed and then slow down again and don't have to deal with time dilation. That is to say - the plot is impossible, but fans of trashy pseudo science fiction don't let the laws of mathematics get in the way of a good story.<br /><br />And from there on there is a downward slide in believability. The only thing you can be sure of is that even the little fact snippets you are given in this text will be guaranteed to be wrong. Dan Brown likes to pass off Urban Legends as fact by putting them in the mouths of clever people. Don't be fooled.<br /><br />This book is for laughs only. But taken that one it is a good laugh. Give it to computer scientists and watch what colour they turn as they read it. Always good for a laugh.

0452273331|4.0|I admit it - I was assigned this book in college but didn't get past what I perceived as the author's thoroughly obnoxious introduction. Fortunately, between an excellent instructor and some really good Cliffs Notes, I didn't HAVE to read it, and I never gave it a second thought. The book had been quite the rage on campus in those days, and I dismissed it in my usual anti-snobbish way. But I recently had the experience of touring some Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings, and I remembered the rumors of Rand basing Howard Roark somewhat on Wright...and I was intrigued enough to dust off my copy and give it a try.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not saying anything unique when I point out that the book is by turns brilliant, maddening, suspenseful, completely unbearable, totally absorbing, realistic, and utterly far-fetched. And I don't think it's unfair to say that Ayn Rand made the mistake of many other women who created memorable male characters (think Dorothy L. Sayers): she fell in love with her own creation.<br /><br />So, that said, I have to give the book an endorsement for a few reasons. First, the second I finished it, I started scrambling to learn more about it. I think only a first-rate work of fiction inspires that sort of scramble (in me, at least). Second, the book made me think, quite deeply, and examine many of my own assumptions. This last, I think, is precisely what Rand had in mind; and I guess I'm adult enough now to allow it, while in college I was not.<br /><br />First, the good. Some of the scenes in this book will live forever in my memory as among the most dramatic and affecting I've read. Roark's defense of himself in the courtroom - the reasons behind Gail Wynand's naming his boat I DO - the glorious descriptions of Monadnock Valley - the scene in which the intellectual snobs, looking down their noses at the common people, decide to make an awful play the toast of the town just to show that they have the power to do so - the final scence of Dominique soaring up over the city to the top of Roark's skyscraper, the symbol of their ultimate triumph. Really, really fine writing there - and an epic imagination that many writers simply aren't capable of.<br /><br />Now, for the characters. For me, these fall into two categories: the human and the not-quite-human. The most human to me was Gail Wynand, and I know why: Rand takes the time to explore his childhood and his formative experiences, so we can see why he's become the man he is today. Peter Keating, a reprehensible slug, is given the same treatment - a complete sell-out, a charming manipulator - but we see a bit of his background and what's driven him. In all the discussions of Keating, I haven't seen him exposed in the way that I think Rand is exposing him: Keating is the archetypical charmer, that slimy, disgusting, good-looking guy (or sexy woman) who uses looks and an ingratiating manner to make his way to the top. There's something so perfectly amoral about that type of person, and I thought Rand captured that archetype almost perfectly with Keating. He's the type of person who feels moderately guilty about doing something wrong, but never for long and never enough to do anything about it. You know the type. You see them in your life everyday.<br /><br />Ellsworth Toohey is the villain of this piece, and he's just about as effective a villain as you can get. His snobbery is epic; while he writes for a rag newspaper, his sense of himself and his ability to shape public opinion (to further his own ends) is not unlike that of many journalists who write for a certain New York City newspaper that I shall not name. We see a bit of Ellsworth's childhood, too; not *really* enough to explain who he is, but enough to give us a hint. Then again, I'm sure most Rand critics would argue that Toohey isn't so much a person as a Symbol of socialism. I'm not arguing that point; what I *am* saying is that he's just as effective as a portrait of, the complete embodiment of,the arrogance of, snobbery. Snobbery's as much a part of our lives today as it was in 1943, when the novel was first published, so the character holds up, as does Rand's complete evisceration of him.<br /><br />Now - Howard Roark and Dominique Francon. These are the not-quite-human characters. If one takes out all of Rand's philosophizing, one might see Roark almost as a sociopath, or at least the ultimate narcissist. The reader (or at least this reader) finds herself on his side, not because he's particularly likable, or even particularly attractive, but because he is so true to his vision. The man who refuses to sell out is a rare man indeed - and this is why I rooted for Roark, even as I wanted him to do what we all do, which is make concessions early in our careers so that we can get established, get noticed, and then have more freedom later on. There are hints that he's capable of great emotion, but he's a one-note character, even though it is quite a note.<br /><br />As for Dominique Francon, she too isn't quite human - again, because Rand gives us no insight into how she became who she is. Like Roark, she just seems to have sprung from the head of Rand (a la Athena springing from the head of Zeus), fully formed as an adult with no formative experiences. She and Roark are two of a kind, operating on a higher plane. It took me a while to get used to this, as Dominique's behavior simply drove me up the wall for the first half of the book. But by the second half of the book I had an epiphany: What makes Roark and Dominique so maddening is the fact that their behaviors are based on IDEAS, on grand conceptions of what the universe is, or should be, rather than what exists in reality.  And that epiphany humanized the characters for me a bit, because I know several people who fit into the same category. For instance, I know a couple who never argue about money, child-raising philosophies, or leaving the toilet seat up, but are rather perpetually on the verge of divorce because each does not fulfill the other's expectations for what SHOULD BE, or what MIGHT BE, or what COULD BE. There are people like that out there, my friends; and let me just say they're as maddening in real life as they are in fiction.<br /><br />I once heard THE FOUNTAINHEAD described as a \\"young person's book\\" - the type of book that young people are impressed by, but one that doesn't stand up to adult analysis. I'm happy I didn't read it as a young woman; I was able to appreciate it, and engage with it, much better as a mature adult. But I can see its appeal to those in the arts, to those who wish to make a life out of their craft. At the same time, though, it made me feel thoroughly bourgeois, because to live as Dominique, Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey, and the other characters in this novel do, you must have a great deal of money. If you have to work for a living, you're too busy putting food on the table to get uppity when your boss tells you what to do.<br /><br />And it's hard not to see all the parallels between Rand's time and ours, especially when it comes to the tastes of the masses. Gail Wynand builds an empire by playing to the lowbrow tastes of the uneducated masses. Newspapers may be on their way out, but we still have reality TV, celebrity gossip magazines, and other horrors to remind us of what sells in this day and age. And I can just imagine how good, hard-working, serious novelists feel when they see the latest piece of dreck from James Patterson rocketing up the best-seller list. I've reviewed some fabulous books that had maybe 5 or 6 reviews here on Amazon. Then I look at Janet Evanovich and see thousands of reviews. It's enough to drive one mad, and Rand wrote a book about it.<br /><br />BUT... amidst the glory, you'll get an awful lot of speeches and pontification that goes on for pages and pages. THE FOUNTAINHEAD is a dense book, and while I enjoyed reading it there were times I thought it would never end. The maddening game betweenRoark and Dominique in the middle of the book nearly sent me off my rocker. I think the average reader needs to be patient with this book, to let it build, to see it as a \\"reading experience\\" rather than a book to be gotten through. I finished it a few days ago, and I'm still thinking about it, and I expect I will continue to do so for quite some time. For me, that's the mark of something enduring, and I can see why Rand has had the influence she's had. I can't critique her philosophy, not really knowing enough about objectivism (or philosophy in general), but I can say that there are times when her prose sings, her descriptions of New York stop the reader in her tracks, and you feel that you are in the presence of a great (albeit somewhat obnoxious) talent. But that's probably the point; maybe the truly great have the right to be somewhat obnoxious. The problem today, I think Rand would say, is that Obnoxious has been adopted by people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, who actually think they matter.

B004XISI4A|3.0|I don't like to make a review of a book when I have only reaches the first 30%, but as English is not my mother tongue I'm a slow reader.<br />Anyway, till this moment it is far more interesting than the boring 4th book. However it is still far from the wonderful first threee books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101- in- games is a pretty sick game. lol it is really fun to play u can get bored of one game than u could play another its pretty cool!!!:)

B0061Q13V2|4.0|I love gymnastics, and I read Dominique Moceanu's autobiography that came out in the 90s, so while there were a few stories I'd already known, much of this book was something completely different. I loved hearing the behind the scenes stuff about a world I've loved for as long as I can remember but never been in (at least not to that level). It's interesting to hear about the life someone else has led. I like the book and her tone throughout, the only reason I'm docking 1 star is because she repeated herself in multiple chapters, and there was someting about the constant changes between 1 gymnastics chapter followed by 1 Jennifer chapter that bothered me. Overall if you're a gymnastics fan, or remember the Magnificent 7 from the 96 olympics, I'd say it's a good read.
1439190275|5.0|this is a great book for the money i purchased 2 of them for under 12.00. lots of useful and updated information. very easy to read and understand I use it all the time for a quick refrence if you are on the atkins diet you wont be disapointed with this book. I knew about the atkins diet but never fully under stood all the phases until i got this book  so glad i ordered it!!
B0024RID60|5.0|THE ROLLING STONES-SOME GIRLS: A last great greasy gasp from the longest lived of all Brit Invasion emsembles, 1978's SOME GIRLS had much to prove after the so-so BLACK & BLUE and lackluster LOVE YOU LIVE albums. Rising admirably to the occasion, this pure party platter spawned three hit singles, the disco-laced chart topper MISS YOU, caustic kiss-off BEAST OF BURDEN, and nasty noisemaker SHATTERED; gritty, street smart tracks such as WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN and RESPECTABLE also garnered ample airplay, the most the band had been on the radio in years. KEITH RICHARDS busted out one of his better vocal growls on BEFORE THEY MAKE ME RUN, while FAR AWAY EYES plotted briefly on the country charts, a humorous twanger awash in MICK JAGGER's wonderfully laid-back pseudo-hillbilly narrative. The album's cover art, featuring Hollywood types who didn't particularly want to be immortalized in such fashion, and the misogynistic title track provided the requisite STONES controversies, further boosting sales. Future STONES platters inevitably contained a shining moment or two, but never again jelled cohesively from start to finish quite like SOME GIRLS.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE TONGUES
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hare this game . I leave my kindle for 1) minutes.and I have 30 notifications.  this is ridiculous. this hqmr was uninstalled immediately .
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game is quite good, it is also very addicting. it isn't the best hidden object game I've played, but it is good.
B0086700CM|5.0|So fun especially for being free!  Definitely a game you can play for hours.  It also lasts a long time with the missions.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|the item descriptions are off so finding items can be difficult ie: goblets are not the same thing as vases....
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|makes ya think and pay attention to details I didn't have to sign onto facebook I just closed it out and went on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is fun and time consuming.  some of the games are hard and some are easy and some are in between
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this for my recent 11 day trip to Alaska and it worked exactly as I had hoped. Each day I was able to transfer the photos from my Canon SD850IS SD Card to my iPad 3 easily and without problems. I never used the direct camera hook up.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love search and find games this is the first free app with no catches for money ibe found for kindlefire and wishing for more
B002L4QP0M|5.0|This is not the most complicated novel in the world. However, it is utterly enjoyable and the character traits are fairly well researched.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I love this product. It is very well made and easily fits any size drink in the cup holder. Plus, I think it is great that I can get two cup holders and a compartment for all my \\"junk\\" at a fraction of the price of Bugaboo's single cup holder. I rated it four stars because it did not fit on my Bugaboo Donkey. The handle is too wide for the straps to reach across and fit properly no matter how much I played with it or adjusted the velcro straps. But then I got the [[ASIN:B00158DS0U Hook 'n' Stroll Stroller Accessory, Black]] to hang my diaper bag on because it was taking up much needed space in my basket. I attached one of the velcro hooks to the strap of the organizer and made it longer! Now it fits perfectly and I am very happy with the way it fits on my handle. I think the only way for this to fit on a Bugaboo Donkey is if you buy the stroller hooks or attach a nice size strip of velcro to make the straps long enough to reach across.
B005J4VV28|1.0|These shows AND the quality of these shows can be found by free download all over the Internet. Additionally, this collection lacks the introduction, the short segments that introduced the commercial breaks, the next week's preview and the ending, all of which were a big part of the show. The only thing you get are the two 5-minute cartoon segments and the middle sing-a-longs from each ~half-hour show.
B003LZ5B7S|1.0|I don't understand why so many people are into this show. It's a typical English, over the top, cheesy, idiotic show. I think it belongs in the kids section.
B0031MA7RA|5.0|A friend who had suffered an injury to the left side of her brain, loaned me a copy of this wonderful autobiography. Enlightening as to the difficulties and challenges, but her insights in evaluating and conducting her own recovery were inspiring. She provided so many valuable clues towards addressing left brain/ right brain functions that we all experience. I am grateful to Dr. Taylor for sharing her insights with us.
B003K8MI4K|1.0|Another cheesy British show. I'm so disappointed as I was anticipating a great sci fi series. Instead I get a British show with...bad teeth. If you're seeking a true cerebral show, pass on this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I liked the game. reminds me of mario. my 4yo loves it too. we actually argued over it..lol<br />I will continue playing it for a good while. :-)
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. this has to be my favorite on my kindle. I love the puzzles you can even set the settings so that you are able to rotate them as if you are sitting down in your living room. I love it.. Its pretty challenging but if you love puzzle like I do you like the complicated and 1000 pieces..
B0086700CM|4.0|It's decent to play. I'm the type that deletes a game a day after having it because I get bored quick. I had this for more than a week now.
B0086700CM|2.0|not my favorite type of game, nice graphics. foundthis game dull as all you seem to do is run and dodge obistacals.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was good i like playing games like this plus there is 100 games in 1 that is just great i love this game
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy has been mesmerizing, humorous, disturbing, dramatic, emotional, and sometimes frightening. It is a unique and wonderful story of love. The first part of Freed was very intense especially one particular scene that takes place in the \\"playroom\\". I almost couldn't take it. Ana herself is apprehensive & has a bad feeling. This is the only scene in all 3 books where Christian is at his absolute worst, driven by his demons and need for control. Ana's courage and reaction to this event shakes Christian to his core.<br /><br />But there is so much more to this third book. Ana herself sums up some details of Freed; \\"fires in computer rooms, car chases, careers planned out for me, (flirty) architects, armed lunatics in the apartment, arguments, his (Christian's) anger\\", The second half is suspenseful with several surprises. Christian finally reveals his past trauma, his relationship with Mrs. Robinson and basically bares his soul to Ana, the woman who saved him from a life that isolated him and left him lonely and without true love.<br /><br />Ana gains more emotional strength and independence in the relationship in Freed. There are a few great scenes where she never backed down and never broke down in front of Christian. She held her ground. She expresses her need for independence very well. She continues to convince him he is worth loving. \\"He is my more, and I am his.\\"<br /><br />My only problem with the trilogy is the editing. A good editor would have deleted repetitive dialogue and repetitive scenes and tightened up the story as a whole. Each book could have been a least 200 pages shorter. Overall, I loved Christian and Ana's love story. I know that people who hate this trilogy will say this review is not helpful. I hope it encourages those who loved or enjoyed book one and two to finish the trilogy! You must read how Christian is \\"freed\\". To each his/her own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its grate get it I have a lot of games and I have to say that this is my favarit have fun
B005UPOAT2|5.0|I was so excited to finally find this movie on blu-ray and was surprised to find it at such a reasonable price. My FAVORITE MOVIE!!
B0079J28NW|5.0|Lovingly restored and recolored, the Blu-Ray of The Beatles' \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is an opening of a time capsule, with the dust of years wiped clean. The mix of traditional animation and the Peter Maxian designs still holds a fascination to this day, with the sound quality now absolutely stunning. Granted, the imaginations behind much of the movie was lysergically enhanced, but it adds to the time-charm of the movie. I can't recommend this enough to Beatles Fans, who already know the songs and probably many of the scenes by heart.<br /><br />Extra Credit due Dept: I really dig the 'cell' reproductions included in the Blu-Ray package. The bonus interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew are brief but delightful, but the VH1 Interview with the surviving Beatles from the '99 DVD release might have been a nice addition. You can choose between mono and 5:1 surround, depending on your purist nature, and the sequence for \\"Hey Bulldog\\" has been reintegrated into the film seamlessly. It's a must own, and I now anxiously await future Beatles' Blu-Rays.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|bought the app and then you have to purchase fonts for $5 after.  what is that all about?  shouldn't it be ready to function after initial investment?
B00280LYIC|5.0|I can't say enough about how this series positively impacted my 7 year old sons (twins who are now 8 and deeply interested in Egyptian mythology due to his Red Pyramid series). I read the series aloud to them. These books are funny, lighthearted, clever and interesting, and both my children and the high school students I teach adore them (several of my 12th graders credit them with getting them \\"back into reading\\"). THANK YOU, Rick Riordan!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|Just try out the game couple days now&hellip;quite fun and interesting. looking forward to achieve more. I share with my family...they enjoy it too.
0425263908|5.0|If you are a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey, than this is a MUST read! There was so much passion shared between two people who were so scarred from a past that was coming back with every moment of them getting closer. It was great from begginning to end...
1401937519|5.0|This book gives validation to what I intuitively know. That we are what Eckhart Tolle describes as \\"beyond our mind.\\" We are not our bodies, thoughts, history, worries, and angst. We are one and everywhere at once. With this concept in mind, no deeper, we can come to realize we are all part of eachother, the universe, G-d. And, death is another state of beingness, just free from our physicality. This book could help to decrease and hopefully eliminate previous fixed and toxic beliefs about people and help to widen the lens while living in this finite realm. I am part of a community of helping professionals. One psychological theoretical orientation founded by Rogers speaks of \\"unconditional positive regard\\" or prizing someone as you would prize yourself. Ms. Moorjani brings this awareness full circle and makes this part of our journey here on earth purposeful, joyful, and connected. Even during challenging times. It is not what I have learned in school or in training, but the genuine relationship that is formed in a safe environment with someone seeking help that can create a positive change. I highly recommend this book to other professionals in helping fields. As my son recently told me, \\"What enters the heart, stays in the heart.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|Great way to waste a few hours! Addicting! Too bad for me but my eight year old is better at it than I am.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Fiona Apple once wrote<br /><br />\\"Please please please<br /> No more melodies<br /> They lack impact, they're petty<br /> They've been made up already\\"<br /><br />True to form, she has created a different sounding product from her previous efforts, more abstract, with fewer sweeping melodies and perhaps, as a whole, somewhat darker with vocal and musical tension. At the same time, The Idler Wheel... is far from humorless.  To me, it sounded dissonant at first but, after I gave it a couple of listens to wrap mind around it, it makes sense, pushing boundaries.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app! love the devotionals...<br />great reading from God's word....<br />God bless you in all that you and in your ministry.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is def a fun game. Searching for objects in the photos is fun and the different listing methods (words, silhouettes, descriptions) keeps it more interesting. A little easy, but big fun!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Enoyed this book as I have enjoyed all of his other books.  Recommend this book to anyone.  Not the feel good feeling at the end, but still makes you feel, there was a purpose.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|its a fun game its your basic &quot;find it&quot; or eye spy got it as a free app of the day and works just fine no complaints here
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Excellent app for photo enhancement...thanks to Amazon<br /><br />We are enjoying this app a lot... Good for kids....very useful<br /><br />Sam<br />Very very very useful ....
0345803485|1.0|This book sucked, it just drag's on and on discribing every excruciating detail, so much so you forget what the point is. Waste of my money.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I've tried a lot of diets; my issue has always been staying with the \\"plan\\". This is simple to follow, I can eat as much as I want, and there is a plan that I can use when I've reached my \\"true weight\\". So far, so good - after 4 weeks I've lost 12 pounds, and have 9 more to go. Looking forward to being me again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Addicting. I love it.The games are simple but fun.And hard.I played it for hours. I think after Im done with this review I will play it some more.I had no problems with ads or anything else. BUY IT!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden picture games. this is one of my favorites. ive been playing this game for a while on the computer. I'm glad its on the kindle now.
B007JYDOI0|4.0|Wow, this is one of those rare books that will stay with you for a long long time. Not a pleasant subject matter, but very well written, informative, and gripping. I can't imagine what it was like as a parent during that time, living in constant fear and not knowing if you'd ever see your child again.  Remember, never forget.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is a damned good book.  Easy to read, though it is helpful to be conversant with the Star Trek universe to appreciate it, but I assume most science fiction readers are so.  The whole situation is insane and rational at the same time and that makes for many funny moments.  Also I felt for the main characters which denotes good character development in my estimation.  Of the 3 codas I disliked the 1st one, too disorganized for my taste and I only skimmed parts.  Codas 2 and 3 were very good as they resolved some of the story detail like epilogues.  I've been reading science fiction for 52 years and Mr. Scalzi's Redshirts rates very highly on my reading satisfaction, a very unique story.
B0086700CM|4.0|great game keeps you alert and interested.I would! recommend it to anyone that needs to escape for a few minutes
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|fun game...relaxing and smooth with a neat story.  I will have to get more games from this developer. plays very good on my kindle fire
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I am playing this game on both iphone and Kindle Fire. it irks me to no end that Amazon can't keep up with updates, or this game would have gotten a better score. Not only that, on the iphone, on the last update, most of my land and animals disappeared!!!
B007TNS6JI|3.0|this game is pretty good but it could really use muiltiplayer. the game is all around a good game. could also use more character types
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I think these songs are good. To me Linkin Park is all about seeing them perform live. These songs will be great in concert just like songs from Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns were.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This is a delightful film, jam packed with excitement. In addition, Angelina Jolie moves about in a tight t-shirt in virtually all the scenes, except the last few minutes, even in the freezing arctic, showing what appears to be, but may not be, artificially extended breasts. She is portrayed in the film as a virtual superwoman, what the disc cover calls the \\"ultimate superhero,\\" with amazing intellect, strength, and agility. In fact, we see her training frequently in remarkable ways to maintain her skills.<br /><br />The plot is sci-fi. Nine planets will line up once every 5,000 years. This is an opportunity to combine certain items and gain enormous powers over time and space. Laura's now dead father trained her for this event. She is determined to do what her father requested. But there is a group of illuminati who also want this power, and their henchman who wants it for himself.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|You will be paying for just one track: Lux Aeterna. The rest isn't good, but just this one track makes worth buying the album.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game is pretty good. lots of things to find and seems to have smooth play. liked it a lot and recommend it if you like hidden object games
1466401885|5.0|This book is amazing.  It leaves you wanting more.  I am praying that she writes a sequel to this book.  This book is perfect for young adults.  We really need more beautiful stories that grab and tug at you like this story does.  Thank you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its an awesome game it is challanging I like ice age the movie so this is so cool I give it 5 stars
B006J420UE|5.0|This CPU is very good value. Seeing as this is my first ever computer build, I though the APU crossfire with a 6000 series radeon sounded very appealing. I have it running crossfire with my PowerColor Radeon 6850 and it gives me great performance. It runs GTA IV without breaking a sweat. While gaming, it reaches about 60 degrees farenheit on the stock cooler. When I ran 3dmark11 with my graphics card overclocking, the system got a 3349. Pretty good for such a cheap CPU. There are a lot of CPUs out there that are much better for gaming, but this one works well as long as you are not runniing games like skyrim or battlefield 3. I might be overclocking this CPU soon too, so look for performance updates.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I like it:) good storyline ..nice graphics...if you like H O G games...you will enjoy this one..Glad I tried it...will recommend it :):)
B005ZUR724|4.0|not bad. graphics are ok. controls are easy to learn. gonna keep playing it and might update the review later.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I LOVE this app. It is the Three apps I cannot live without. I love listening to radio stations from<br />around the world. As of now, my current favorites are: radio Caroline from UK and Celtic Evenings from Ireland. Nice to hear accents and with no commercials!!<br /><br />  You can record what you hear-I have done so when a UK radio station will do an artist of the day..UK has different hits that somehow dont get across the water to become American top 40's:hence you hear different songs from your favorite artists wioch is great when you get tired of the same old same old. There are presets for your favorite radio stations across the US too. So if you move, or have a college station you miss, no more. You can get it here....for 99 cents. What a deal. You cant go wrong.<br /><br />  And BTW this goes will ALL music genres...even talk radio, sports, and an all Elvis all the time station. Go exploring...all in the comfort of your KindleFire.<br /><br />I swear, I am beginning to describe my life as before KindleFire & After I got it;-)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Could barely get to the \\"erotic\\" part!!!  The heroine is so unbelievably dull and poorly described that you want to cringe at her oh's and ah's!  The climatic male character is also a bore, no intelligence here, no pouring out of soul or for that matter sustainable intimacy.  These two deserve each other and will remain with just half the book read.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|great game!!! myself and kids love it! great for road trips down loaded with no problems. we like the hidden objects and the different charecters.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I had a lot of fun with this app but finally decided to uninstall it because of the very annoying pop up VIDEO ads. There was no way to bypass them except to quit the app.
B000002KLG|5.0|During this time frame in the late 70's and early 80's there was some seriously GREAT music coming out from the producer and his hit factory known as \\"Q\\" a.k.a. Quincy Jones.  Having been a George Benson fan for some time already when I heard that George Benson and \\"Q\\" were getting together for an album I couldn't wait for the release.  I was not at all disappointed and was thrilled by the music produced on this album.  Star of the Story, Midnight Love Affair, the funky Off Broadway, Love X Love and all the rest of the songs were so GOOD!!  I rate this album as one of MY top three in history, right along with Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" and Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\".  George Benson is still at it singing and strumming his guitar and some 32 years have passed since this album came out but it is superb TIMELESS good fabulous music!!  Call it R & B, pop, soul, jazz, fusion just 'Give Me The Night\\"
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|so far so good. hope it doesn't  come up and ask me to pay later like a lot of these others by g5. that's very annoying when it says free then part of the way into the game it says to play more pay for full version.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Back in April one of the ladies in my favourite Goodreads group read this book and highly recommended it to the rest of us and since I'm already a huge fan of Ellen (who isn't?!) I immediately put it on hold and read it the same day I got it from the library.<br /><br />The book is everything I expected it to be; entertaining! I honestly think there was a smile on my face the whole time I read this book she's just that funny. At the time I was reading it I had been in a bit of a grumpy mood so I figured why not remedy that with a little does of Ellen? She always cheers me up and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. I went to be that night feeling a lot better. I suppose people are right sometimes when they say that laughter is the best medicine.<br /><br />I loved how she approached this book in typical Ellen fashion. She didn't take herself to seriously and without ego which I absolutely love about her. She's candid and open about her life and she comes across as wacky as she does on her show. I love how she took the time to catch the readers up on her life since her previous book was published.<br /><br />I would without a doubt have no problem recommending this to anybody and if you're a fan of Ellen's or are looking for a great warm, light-hearted and funny read this might just be the book for you. She writes it in a way that will lift you up so don't read it if you're looking for a book that's deep because this is written in the essence that is Ellen.
B007VT6QSI|1.0|This isnt music, this is \\"product\\"!  You can't even head the dudes voice, it's all sound affects, synthesized, like feed through a computer, processed, homogenized and than finally the finished product.  Why don't they let this guy just sing some music?  I seen a video on You Tube once where just him and his guitar singing a tune.  It sure sounded better than this fake album.  The music industry is doing this more and more!  Just producing product out of popular artists.  No wonder all the music sucks nowadays! I admire artists like Sara Bareilles that write their own music and then make their own album.  Her last album was fabulous, real music, a real singer singing real songs (and playing music).  She's a rare example though.  Guys like Bieber are the most pitiful ones so popular that what they put out really doesn't matter at all. Like Brittney Spears when she was in her prime putting out the bubble gum music of that time. I really wonder if this guy will even last as long as she has?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Once you start reading you forget to watch the clock. Next thing you know 2 hours have gone by. This was my first Kindle purchase, thanks to my daughter Ashley for my Mother's Day present. Great and easy reading!
0525478817|5.0|This book is simply magical. He takes a scenario that is relatable but un-like anything most people will ever experience. Some people are turned off from this book because they're led to believe it is 'just another cancer story'. Well I'm telling you that this is not just another cancer story, it's so much more than just a cancer story. It is definitely written for a young adult audience but I highly recommend it for adult readers as well. All of John Green's novels have proven themselves to be through provoking and interesting and this one is by far my favorite. If you purchase this book and enjoy it then I recommend all of his other novels.
B0086700CM|5.0|amazing game get it ASAP just an overall great game never gets old and its very entertaining get a high score!!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The writers must have written this one up in one sitting, cause I know they must have been tired when they got near the end. Remember in Alien, when they came across the big dead guy sitting in the controls chair, with his ribcage blown out, on the alien ship? Well, prometheus was doin ok with leading up to how that came to be, then the alien guy ends up back in a different part of ship at the end, and gets infected after leaving the control chair and the alien explodes out of him in another area of the ship. Like I said, the writers must have been wacked when they wrote end part, it was making sense, then ?????????? Oh, I get it, maybe we are supposed to believe that the Alien, after bursting out, carried the big guy back to the control chair and placed him there, yeah, of course, how did I not figure that out? That way it would be easier for Dallas and Kane, to find him easier when they came along in \\"Alien\\"
B006QKKMBA|2.0|Should have stopped the movie franchise at number 3.  We have a large screen TV and the poor special effects were obvious.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Im not going to get all long winded but if you're into soul you'll love this album. Sold sound start to finish with obvious old school soul influences. I can't wait to see what the Alabama Shakes put out next.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Once I got the &quot;hang&quot; of this I loved it. Works awesomely on Kindle Fire. I can get all major social networks including facebook. One special thing- the font is big; that, alone, is worth it for me. I can share all.  Only drawback being no ability to download photos. Maybe you can; I just don't know how, yet. Try it out; it's free. Quite a deal.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this game is really fun and my kids love it. it's challenging and that's what makes it fun. plus it has great graphics . thanks amazon :-)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Recommended by a friend. Cant put it down! Hubby keeps telling me to quite playing with groceries and go buy some LOL
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it its the best game besides emross war u should buy it amazon can be a pain with updates though
B003KATMYC|5.0|Don't know why people have a problem with this episode; all Dalek episodes are great, and I'm always excited to see how a new Doctor's going to deal with seeing live Daleks. Matt Smith's reaction was rational and yet surprising; great anger. The plot makes sense to me, seeing as Daleks can time-travel, and the whole human-decoy thing was intricate, fooling Churchill into thinking the Daleks weren't what they really were. Fun and fascinating, gotta love the Daleks!
B003O86FMW|1.0|Don't bother with this depressing hopeless story. The nessesary humor- love for others- potential lover's are lost in the two final books. So all that remains is loss grief depression and the deteriation of katness and friends.
1609611543|1.0|It sounds good at first cuz you can eat potatoes with butter and sour cream and ice cream and corn chips and potato chips but when you get to the end of the book. He says if you want to lose weight then you can't eat the good stuff. What a bunch of crap!!! This is the atkins diet!!
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a pretty good workout DVD. Simple to follow, not too annoying, and a good workout with different levels. My only issue is that it is a few minutes longer than dvertised. But not a gouge proble,m- I just like to time things and noticed it pretty quickly. Jillian gives good tips and it gets all muscle groups. Like many, I did it for a few weeks and the haven't for a while....
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|the game is fun. good hide &amp;seek game. lots of diff objects to sort through to find the specific object u need. not a fan of the story line but i just skip then to play the game. but i wish it was different then doing the same thing but with different backgrounds
0307592731|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book after all the hype. It was repetitive, full of whining, and very boring.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app!! Love the daily readings and the ease of use,  great way to start the day!!  Most used app that I have.
B0086700CM|3.0|When I was babysitting this app saved me. The TV was broken and the kids were really wild and it was almost time for bed. I told them they could play a game if they were quiet. The kids ended up falling asleep playing the game. Then I took it off my kindle because I thought it was a lame game.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I'm glad there is a no time limit option for this app. It would be a more enjoyable game on my laptop, but for those that like hidden objects you will enjoy the challenge.
B0086700CM|3.0|Ok this app lags and skips alot so I would not prefer it if u hate lags. I have a iphone so I would prefer it on that because it was made if the apple Market but know that's a different story. so any way u can try it on kindle fire but when u make it to the millions and it lag and mess u up u will be pissed like me.Try it on a iphone or ipad its better and does not lag.
0525951652|5.0|Ken follett deftly weaves the fictional stories of men and women against the real events of the early 20th century.<br /><br />Follett has a knack for creating archtypes (or sterotypes) who help to convey the spirit of the times.  He has done this in previo0us bestsellers like Pillars of the Earth and he does it again here.<br /><br />This is a fine read and will give you many hours of pleasure.  I look forward to the next books in the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a really fun app. Just as good and fun as Mario game. I could play this game for a long time and not get bored. great for the price of free.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the ads are annoying but I do like the game<br />there is one add at the beginning of each game
B00773YOB4|4.0|I enjoy listening to this entire CD.  That is unusual for me to say.  Her voice still has the same smooth style it had decades ago.  There are a couple of Bonnie Raitt wanna-bes out there that can fool you for a phrase or two but they always fall short some where.  It's good to see her doing something new.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have needed a nice case but they are so expensive.  A similar bag to this is at my local camera shop for $179.00 - the price on this is insane!!! I ended up getting another one when I saw the quality of this bag.  Its nice that you can remove/add the seperators for your lens.  I use one bag solely for my lights & batteries.  Tons of room in this bag... solid construction... sturdy... I cant say a thing bad about it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is fun but some pple are hating it. well if u hats this game u should get a life u piece of junk,  crap,  and sorrow . so u try and see if its good or not cuz its good. again if u are the haters of this game u are big fat losers.
B0058VW36U|1.0|the little green thing kept saying black potato beer toe and that's not funny becaurse I'm black and if amazon keeps doing this I will get twp dash my homie to put an end to this game
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I'm tired of all these scavenger games on Android; they're all pretty much the same.  I'll give this one extra star for the dialogue and plot, however.<br /><br />I'm sure glad I didnt actually pay for this app.  Anything over a dollar seems a bit much to me.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Great movie. Possibly my favorite Woody Harrelson(sp?) movie.  The two most important rules: Cardio & Double Tap.  Now get some.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, can keep me going for hours. I like how ey change up what to find.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|not bad. some of the games arent very good, kind of boring. but for the most part pretty good games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really outstanding! You will love this awesome game where you can unlock more games with your points! I really enjoy this game you have to get it if you don't like it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!! Had to force myself to stop playing just to write this review!! 5 stars!  I'm addicted!!
B0086700CM|5.0|YES I am so happy that this game is finally compatible with kindlefire now!  I played this game so much on an ipod and I love it so much! it never gets old!  I especially like collecting coins with the coin magnet, and buying everything that's available!  Then I like to try to beat my high score! but is it possible to use the wallpapers that I bought on kindlefire though...
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I had the opportunity to watch this gem three times, and every time I see and understand more detail.<br />It's very rare these days to see a movie that takes some thinking and reflection to fully enjoy, and is actually fun to see repeatedly.<br />Watching this movie, you realize how deeply a single author with vision, who lived before the time of space travel, or TV, influenced science fiction all the way to our time.<br />In my opinion, the small changes that were done to the story, were beneficial.<br />The 3D is very good in this movie. The non 3D blue ray disk, includes lots of interesting bonus features, including something called Second Screen.<br />Its really cool, you run an app on your iPad, and it follows along automatically. The iPad displays various cool facts, and movies appropriate to what is showing in the movie. You can pause the movie from the iPad, and enjoy the scene specific bonus features at your own pace.<br />Its really quite amazing.<br />There are also many other interesting bonus features on this blue-ray disk.<br />In conclusion, I strongly recommend this movie to viewers who enjoy swashbuckling, conspiracy, mystery, heroes etc.
B000002C2E|5.0|Wow didn't see this coming.  After a fairly unproductive period in the early 90s which saw the relaease of Under The Red Sky, Bootleg Series Vols. 1-3, Good As I Been To You, World Gone Wrong, 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, Greatest Hits Vol 3 and MTV Unplugged - Dylan releases this amazing collection of songs seemingly out of nowhere.  Highlands is one of his best songs EVER!  His voice is perfect for these songs and every song is amazing - highly recommended - get it now!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I first got my Kindle back in April, this was the first book to buy and I was so excited to read it. I didn't want to go to the movie without having read it so I tried many times to begin the book. I would get through the first couple of pages and put it down. I just could not get into and I don't know why. Maybe it was as exciting as I thought it would be at the beginning but last week my mom told me she read all three books in a few days because she just couldn't put them down. We talked about it and she wouldn't give me any information but just to keep reading. And I did. I read right through all three books in three days. With three kids and online classes, I could barely accomplish this but I was reading this book everywhere I went. I had it in while I was feeding the baby, fixing food, everywhere but the shower! I seriously had to see how it would all work out in one way or another. This book has characters that when you actually pay attention are weak but strong in their own ways. They complement each other and you can see how likable Peeta is from the beginning. The second and third book bring many other issues to the table but the first book sets the stage.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I was looking for some Lego sets that took a little longer to build and are harder to put together, this one was it, it's perfect!
B006RUJST6|4.0|I don't think I could possibly think of a more perfect man than Will!  He is just the most real and honest character I have had the pleasure of reading about.  Lake is such a strong character in her own right and deals with her struggles in the best way she can.  I love how she expresses her anger in such a real and passionate way.  This book had me so torn into pieces for these two people...all you can think about is how much you want them to be together.  I laughed and cried...and loved this book!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This movie started off pretty slow, but got better toward the middle. It was a great blend of horror and political history. You can tell it's based on a graphic novel because of the often bright colors, slow-motion action fight scenes, and cgi gore, but it was still fun. When Abe Lincoln's mother is killed, he vows revenge against the man who did it. When he finds out the killer was a vampire, he's trained by Henry Sturgess to become a fearless vampire hunter. I like the last half of the movie better because Lincoln looks more like himself that we know with the beard. Will Lincoln be able to free the slaves, stop the war, and kill all the vampires during his Presidency? I'd definitely recommend ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is both exciting and entertaining it is a fun game to play on my kindle fire and my 10 yearold daughter LOVES it
B0086700CM|5.0|I wasn't going to review this game because I think it's about a 3-4 star app, but the previous ten reviews I saw were all people giving one star and saying the game was junk and that you need real cash to advance. That could not be further from the truth. Yes, it's a simple game, but it's a cell phone/tablet game. If you want a game that's better or more fun, get yourself a good computer, a console, or even a handheld like a PS Vita.<br /><br />Secondly, to address the comments about needing to spend real money to advance in the game, that's just ignorant. I have only spent about 30 minutes total in the three times I have played the game, and I already have the four power ups upgraded half way. There are extra characters and skins for your cell phone that cost a ton of coins, but they're bonus visual perks and don't change the gameplay in the slightest.<br /><br />In closing, the game isn't a bad way to kill a little time if you're sitting in a waiting room or something similar where you have 10-15 minutes to burn. I don't think you can ever win the game, you just try to top your best score, which isn't for everyone, but seriously, if you want a complex game, why are you trying to find one on the Android market? Stop being such a cheap lame ass and spend some $$ on a system designed for that purpose! Lastly, have a nice day! =]
0446520950|4.0|In a timely novel where we have major corporations going public, \\"Total Control,\\" is a story of the world of finances and corporate espionage.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer works for Triton Global where his wife, Sidney, is a legal counsel. He's secretly looking for another job and books a flight to California.<br /><br />Before his plane leaves, Jeff meets someone and switches flights, now heading toward Seattle.<br /><br />Triton is a high tech company in the final stage of bidding for CyberCom, which would bring the company great wealth. However, there is another company, RTG which is also trying to obtain CyberCom. RTG wants to learn what Triton's offer is so they can outbid them.<br /><br />The plane that Jason was to take, crashes, killing everyone aboard. Including in that group is Arthur Liberman, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.<br /><br />When the FBI is called to investigate, they determine that the plane crash was the result of sabotage.<br /><br />When it is discovered that Jeff wasn't on the plane that crashed, he comes under suspicion. He's not available to defend himself and Sidney comes under more scrutiny. It seems that most of her employees have their eye on how much money they can make for themselves in this mega deal.<br /><br />Sidney doesn't know who to trust and only one person seems to feel that she's not guilty but will that be enough?<br /><br />Baldacci's clever writing is a pleasure to experience. There are good characters and a plot that provides excellent entertainment.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|After reading a ton of reviews online in regards to building a HTPC. I have to say I bought the right barebones system. No over heating problems even though it's placed in my entertainment system with a external USB cooling fan, just in case.<br /><br />System Specs:<br />Intel i7 chip<br />36 Gigs of Ram<br />AMD 6750 HD Card<br />Sony BluRay Burner<br />Logitech Harmony IR Remote<br />Microsoft IR Receiver<br />2 Terabyte 7200 RPM Hard Drive<br /><br />Works GREAT !!!!<br /><br />Zero problems after 3 months of use.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Enjoy the graphics and hunt and find of the objects.  keeps my attention and makes me want to come back and play it more.
B00000ICN5|5.0|\\"Texas Flood\\" was originally meant to be their demo at first,but it was so good,that epic records wanted this as Stevie's first album.Every single song on here is fantastic! Noboby could play like SRV...and I mean NOBODY! He was an amazing guitarist,with a wonderful soulful spirit,who could pull you in,into his music,and have you feel every bit of heart and soul that he put into his guitar playing and singing.But sadly.He was gone way to soon.But his music and his spirit will live on forever.The remastered package of this with the bonus tracks is awesome.I really loved this version of \\"Tin Pan Alley\\",more so than the version that would appear on \\"Couldn't Stand The Weather\\".There was just something that sounded more pure about this unreleased outtake version of that song.The live tracks are great too.I really loved the live version of \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\".Pick this CD up,If you're a fan of blues,or just great music.If you've never heard Stevie Ray Vaughan's music before,This CD is a perfect introduction.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Being neither a reader of Canon Doyle's nor a particular fan of mystery novels, I felt it was time to delve into both.  This collection of short stories exhibited to me that the author truly has a commendable ability to tell an easily understood and very fluid tale.  His exposition is linear and does not rely on flashbacks or forward projections and his utilization of Watson through 1st person singular is unique.  While I still remain less than enamored by mystery tales, I can understand why he is a long-standing favorite of the reading public.<br /><br />The 'gliches' that occur in the translation whenever a number or foriegn phrase is used do become tedious but, when the price is $0.00, one cannot complain too loudly.<br /><br />The tales that are included are:<br />1. A Scandal in Bohemia<br />2. The Red-Headed League<br />3. A Case of Identity<br />4. The Boscombe Valley Mystery<br />5. The Five Orange Pips<br />6. The Man with the Twisted Lip<br />7. The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle<br />8. The Adventure of the Speckled Band<br />9. The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb<br />10. The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor<br />11. The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet<br />12. The Adventure of the Copper Beeches<br /><br />In spite of not having a totally unpleasant reading experience, I much prefer the video versions put out by BBC or the movie series starring Morton Downey Jr..  Their plots are far more intricate and portray Holmes as being less of a stodgy character and little more eccentric and unpredictable in his actions.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is an awesome CD! From start to finish. I love the way the CD starts off with a slow guitar intro on Fight Fire With Fire,then all of a sudden it gets up in your face with hard metal! I love it.My favorite song on here is,Fade To Black,which is my favorite Metallica song of all time.But every song on this album rocks.Just a shame there is only eight tracks on here though.I wish there was a re-release of this,with bonus tracks,such as outtakes or something cool like that.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app has soo many plans to chose from u will never lack for ideas for devotional time, plus they have a ton of versions to check with. easy to use.<br />only problem is u need wifi to access it.
B00845PRDS|5.0|I read the reviews about the acting and I would take a handful of \\"not so great acting\\" Navy SEALS to the entire Hollywood group.  These guys were GREAT.  My daughters watched this with me and it showed the service these elite guys do for our country so Hollywood can act better.  I rented this movie and I bought it.  Great movie...
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|so far it is fun. A little hard to see on a small screen. The zoom feature helps a lot.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|lots of fun with a little story line..yes you do need facebook to log in....but other than that it fun and addicting..
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I'm done.  I'm 640 pages into the third installment of the series and I want out!  The series is well written so you actually begin to care for the characters and Martin kills too many of them off.  Then he keeps you interested enough so that you continue to read his books.  Well I'm done, there is too much good stuff to read to put up with this kind of frustration!  Martin is not going to suck me into reading book four!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great it keep you on your feet stimulate your mind the turns and jump are in all the right places
B001IF252M|1.0|This is being sold as an Apple product,in retail packaging, which it IS NOT. This seller (Superlite Electronics Co., Ltd.) is blatantly lying to you, and apparently Amazon it okay with this. I have complained to Amazon, without any response yet. I will update this review if I get a response. Don't bother buying this cheap knock-off, it will not work with most devices due to its cheap construction. It also does not send the identifier to the display, causing even more compatibility problems.<br /><br />***Update 6/25/12, 10:30 PM***<br /><br />I had a chat session with Amazon tonight and they are looking into this matter.<br /><br />I had to order a NEW adapter that was both Sold & Fulfilled by Amazon to insure I would receive the OEM Apple adapter.<br /><br />Amazon said they will be investigating my claims against this seller (Superlite Electronics Co., Ltd.) to determine further actions needed.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY any items sold by Superlite Electronics Co., Ltd., unless it expressly states that it is a 3rd party or generic part.<br />They obviously cannot be trusted to list an HONEST & ACCURATE description of the items they are selling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addictive makes you want to keep playing very entertaining and different I like it. hope you enjoy this game as much as I ddo
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play when you are bored. one thing I don't like about it is there are way too many ads.

B007SGM084|5.0|This is a fun book with just enough kink and sex to make you blush reading it in public. Parts were a bit korny but that's ok.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like the holder/cover. Color did not matter to me. Protects my kindle and keeps it clean. My only dislike with it is the fact there is only one position to hold the kindle for viewing/ typing. Would be much more user friendlier if it had 2 or 3 different adjustments of angle.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read this book after reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". I heard the writing was better then Fifty. In my opinion, I thought phrases were used over and over (a critical point of Fifty Shades, but same in this book as well). The characters I wanted to die in a fiery car crash halfway through the book. I hated these characters with a passion. At least with Christian and Ana, you feel for them and root for them. In \\"Bared to You\\", I just wanted them to die a horrible death and didn't care what happened to them. It was horrible and the characters were just awful terrible people. Ugh, don't waste your money.
B006RUJST6|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK. I love everything about this book. Love the way is written, the characters, the story, etc. Once I started I couldn't put it down, so I read it in 7 hours. As soon as I finish it, I bought Point of Retreat. Again, I finished it inmediately. I just hope that Collen Hoover writes a book about Coulder and Kel, they're such great characters and so funny. I want to know about their lives when they grow up. Whoever reads this review, take a chance and buy both books, you would not regret it.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|thought it was going to be a good game but game froze my kindle fire. not worth it if it does it. thank goodness it was app for the day. don't waste your money
B0034JGBM0|5.0|Really liked this cd and also bought the video. Found that I like the live versions of songs better than the studio versions. Crazy that the band is just Jack and Meg as the sound is so full. Good stuff and I'd recommend it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|its a great game. I love it and everything about the game. the only problem I had was one search item. the item to search for was a flute. but there was no flute in the store. I then clicked the clarinet and I got the item. I play the flute and I do not like that. please get your items correct. thank you. all in all a great game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best free Bible app available. I highly recommend this. The ability to download versions to use offline is amazing.
B0086700CM|5.0|its exactly like the iphone app nothing is any different. I will admit the graphics aren't that great but that doesn't really matter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought the game was petty good overall. some of. the games hard to pass but I loved it :)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Very nice app, makes editing photos a snap. The biggest thing I'd like to see improved would be the ability to be in Gallery, then &quot;share&quot; the picture directly into this program instead of having to open this, locate the image in the gallery, then work with it. That would save a few steps which would be nice. :)
144185696X|5.0|Another great Michael Connelly novel. Listening to it on CD makes it even better. Connelly has the best narrators in the CD book market. When you hear the narrator it's like you are listening to the real Harry Bosch. You get to know the detective as if he were a real person. Love all of these books.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|was fun to play :) really nice for passing the time<br />would reccomend it to allmy friends. I have the kindle version and hope there is a sequel soon :)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think its amazing. What most fun about this app is that it challenges you to think of new ways to combine the elements.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|sweet I just got it and I love it I cant stop playing it. It is one of the most addicting games I have
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Dont like anything about this app.  Dont the name.  Don't like the way it runs.  Don't like how slow it is.  We say this game sucks.  The thing is creepy.
1416550550|5.0|I was looking for a good book to start reading during the summer. 'The Forgotten Garden' by Karen Morton was recommended to me by a friend who said when she started reading it she 'could not put it down'. After reading a sample on my Kindle I was, to say the least, intrigued. After considering the options, I decided on purchasing this as an used book. The product came in the time and condition as advertised. I am happy with the service I received and look forward to reading this book.[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]
B00633W614|5.0|Once again Jeffrey Archer has done it again! It is hard to believe that this is the same man who served in government, imagine if he could have dedicated his time to writing instead. Unfortunately we will have to wait for the next installment! My Archer spins a spellbinding yarn and keeps you wondering what will happen to his characters. I am eagerly waiting to see what will happen to Harry Clifton in the next book.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I think they need to come up with more games that are better than this one and make it good and fun
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a story with a ghost-busting challenge.  I like when games have a story to work along with and feel like you are accomplishing something.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I purchased this for my Go Pro Hero 2 so that when I'm using it on my bike for long periods of time I can charge it while using it. The price was right! And your going to need to charge or connect to your TV or monitor this case make it very easy to do that.  This camera is so small and may be very delicate outside the case so I always try to keep it in a case. Very happy with this case and glade I got it. If you think you might also go for it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I personally love this app to death. I love the creative things that you can draw. I have 7 games going on now. Love the different color packs.
0691152640|4.0|I bought this book in hopes of becoming a better investor. It is not an easy read.<br /><br />This message they impress on you first and hardest is well worth learning: financial folly in high places is the rule, not the exception. Now if I can learn to recognize the signs before the next collapse, the book would be a bargain at any price. This will require paying attention to some obscure and monumentally boring economic data. Easy to say. Tough to do.<br /><br />At the very least, you will learn to trust your instinct more. When financial trends appear on the cover of Time or Newsweek, run for your life.

B007SGM084|3.0|I fought so hard to avoid reading this book, but finally, I caved in.<br /><br />I was told that this book was so controversial, due to the sex/BDSM scenes.. and as someone who enjoys BDSM romance novels, I was anxious to start.<br /><br />My honest opinion, read 50 shades of Grey and 50 shades darker... then STOP. 50 Shades Fixed was pointless. Sex scenes were all the same, and the characters don't really progress throughout the book.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed the book strictly due to the fact that it's a romance novel, but not for any BDSM purposes. Why was this book so controversial? Because it referenced a D/S relationship? Because Christian used floggers, canes, and handcuffs? Because it spoke about a domme in a power exchange with a minor?<br /><br />Reading from Ana's POV was interesting because she wasn't very \\"experienced\\" so whenever she was in her head freaking out about anything, it was pretty funny because I do that as well.<br /><br />Anyway, that was a rant. Don't waste your money on the digital version, I'd get the paperback or ask around to borrow it, I assure you, someone you know has the series.<br /><br />If you're truly interested in a BDSM romance novel, read the Master's of Shadowlands series by Cherise Sinclair.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Not a bad game. It's challenging and fun but the controls are a bit poor.  Sometimes you accidentally press a button and it's hard to figure out what you changed.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The movie starts out having the usual cliche storyline of a young princess trying to live free.<br /><br />Things pick up when a magical spell is involved, creating hilarious antics with the characters in this movie.<br /><br />I loved it.  It has a great message, the animation is amazing, and it can be entertaining for any age.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have been playing it for 10 minutes, I'm in room 2 and it wants a review. So far I'm happy with it.
0060936223|2.0|I don't get it. Writing is flat and overwrought in places. I felt I was reading about the creation of an image rather than a person. Patti Smith remembers the clothes she wore to every event more than 40 years ago; she remembers every encounter with every famous person. But insight? Missing.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|fun and simple. time waster is a plus. decent plot so far. definitely played worse games. Hopefully it will keep me entertained.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|the game started freezing at the 43 level. others complained about un real wait times it never happend to me. so for like two weeks i was a pioneer
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Pros<br />Very well built. Super accurate. Nice design and color.<br /><br />Cons<br />The strap is just \\"not right.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line.<br />If you don't want to go too expensive but want a great piece of craftsmanship, then go with the seiko snk805k2.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I like it. works for what I wanna do with my pics just needs more fun addons. but don't have any beg things to say
B005UPOAT2|4.0|I bought this movie recently on a whim, as a friend told me I would probably like it. I am also a big fan of Kate Beckinsale(I'm a guy and what guy isn't LOL).  Anyways, I won't delve too much into the movie as this is the blu ray review of this film.<br /><br />Basically, if you are a hopeless romantic you will like this film.  The music is great throughout the movie.<br /><br />The blu ray transfer is HD is great so the fillm looks and sounds excellent.  There are a decent amount of special features that make this a bargain at $9.99.<br /><br />Now I need to find a Sarah Thomas and her number :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are difficult due to them not doing what you try to make them do....others have brought this up. I'm stuck on the snake game....eerrr.  There are a lot of adds but hey its a free game, I can deal with that! Enjoy
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I've been a Maroon 5 fan since their first album. Although their music has evolved and change in some ways from their debut album I appreciate their diversity. Adam's falsetto is no different than it's ever been, he just may be utilizing it a little more on this album. Pop yes, Auto-tune NO, great dance music absolutely!!
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I love her music and she is one of my favorates. Every song on her first three albums are amazing. But this new album is so boring and depressing. Wheres the music, it makes me want to jump off a bridge. I just keep thinking I waited seven years for this, wow. So dissapointing.
1451627289|4.0|Haven't we all wished we could go back in time and do over some things in our life? We don't think of the cost to ourselves or the world as we know it. Every action good or bad has a causal effect on modern day time, so Stephen King illustrates in his well written 11/22/63.<br /><br />`The past is obdurate.'<br /><br />It resists change as Jake Epping finds out. The bigger the change in the past, the bigger effect on the time continuum and its harmony is broken in modern day. But the 35 year-old English teacher will risk the obdurate past to change the course of history by stopping Lee Harvey Oswald. JFK will live.  But at what cost? Jake's friend, Al Templeton, has returned to 2011 5 years older and terminally ill. Jake hesitates, wanting proof that changes made in the past will be positive. He has something in mind. The man who doesn't cry wept as he read an essay written by one of his more mature GED students, Harry Dunning. Frank Dunning killed his entire family with a hammer on Halloween 1958 with the exception of Harry. If he can save the Dunning family, Jake will try to stop the JFK assassination. And so he begins the descent into Lisbon Falls, Maine through Al's diner. It is 11:58 A.M, September 9, 1958. The past has reset. No matter how long Jake is gone, when he returns to the diner, he will have only been gone from 2011 two minutes.<br /><br />After a harrowing eight weeks in Derry, Jake is relieved to be back in Lisbon Falls. He steps over the chain fence to go back to Al's \\"rabbit hole.\\" The yellow card man is now the orange card man and Epping is afraid. He's prevented a massacre, a young girl's shooting, and a young man's despair. \\"Jimla!\\" cries the orange card man. Yes, Epping is a changed man. But the orange card man sees him as a ghost or a monster. Monster or not, Epping returns to 2011 and is mostly pleased with the changes he has made. He will do what Al Templeton cannot. As George Amberson, Jake will find out if Oswald is solely responsible for the assassination. If he is, then Epping/Amberson will stop Oswald. He will not fail to do what is necessary to keep the young President alive on that November morning. But when he returns to 1958 Lisbon Falls, he sees a frightening sight: the orange card man has changed and his card is black. But Jake can't think about that. He has to save the Dunning family and Carolyn Poulin again before going to Texas. When his business is done in Maine, Epping immerses himself into his new identity and heads south. His travels take him to Florida's Gold Coast to Jodie, Texas. George Amberson is a substitute teacher who is writing a murder mystery, \\"The Murder Place\\". To further complicate his mission, Jake/George meets an attractive but clumsy librarian.  Sadie Dunhill is the love of Jake/George's life. Will he be successful in his mission? Will he leave 1963 or stay in the past? Can he stay?<br /><br />The addition of the love story between Jake and Sadie pleasantly surprised me. The lovers' story worked and added tension to the central plot.  King's research of Oswald and the JFK assassination is evident, because as he said in an interview: the event of 11/23/63 was his generation's September 11th. What I didn't particularly like was the bashing of Republicans: if Democrats were elected, all is well. May be, and may not. My family is what would be considered as \\"blue dog\\" Democrats with a few Republicans in the mix. And everyone loved Kennedy. It may have been the fresh approach the young President took that gave the country hope. I don't know. I was 5 years old when JFK was killed, but I remember watching JFK, Jr. salute the funeral procession and my parents' tears. I felt their sadness for quite a while after Kennedy's burial in Arlington National Cemetery. I would find books on their nightstand about the Kennedy's and the Assassination mingled with books on WWII and the Depression for many years. Could Viet Nam been avoided as Al Templeton firmly believed? Could 9/11 beena bad CIA scenario? We will never know. We can only theorize. King tells a tale that we all wish could have happened, albeit with better consequences. But life turns on a dime.a bad CIA scenario? We will never know. We can only theorize. King tells a tale that we all wish could have happened, albeit with better consequences. But life turns on a dime.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I am on the next to last &quot;level &quot;. I've enjoyed this hidden object game.  Not too hard and not too easy. I think it has just enough action to keep you interested.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|ever since version 3, I have been having a array of issues. The worst one is that the backspace key seems to randomly insert all text behind the cursor repeatedly, instead of deleting text!! this has rendered the keyboard useless, and frankly I am seriously bummed out. Hopefully this gets fixed in an update....
0307591549|5.0|I'm about half-way through \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" and have so many great ideas for ways I can get passionate about work again, that I know I'll be re-reading this book several times.<br />It's also good to see that I already do a lot to help myself, i.e. I'm on the right track, and by incorporating the ideas that stand out on this reading, I know I can bring a whole new passion to my professional and personal life. I think this is going to one of those books you dip into from time to time to remind yourself about a particular concept. It would also be good to re-read each year as a refresher course.<br />I haven't read a lot of business books, like some of the reviewers, so this is all pretty new to me. Worth every cent.
B00062PN6I|4.0|Well, I have to admit I am pretty harsh on my headphones. When I have a good pair of headphones, I will use them daily, favoring them over my laptop speakers and even my stereo. This means they get a lot of wear and tear, and if I'm being honest I rarely wrap the cord for storage in my computer bag. That is why I usually buy cheap headphones. I saw the Behringers for just over ten bucks, and with Amazon Prime shipping I really couldn't resist.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />Now before going on to my review I wanted to point out that my order did in fact come with a 1/8\\" to 1/4\\" adapter. The stock jack attached to the wire is an 1/8\\" regular headphone jack, the adapter turns it in to an 1/8\\" jack. This is NOT how the originals shipped out, but it is safe to say that you can now disregard the earlier reviews.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY<br />I have to admit the HPM1000's are relatively comfortable. These headphones sit nicely on my ears, and being adjustable it is not too hard to find the sweet spot for your head. The plastic has held up rather well so far, and the cushioning is pretty well attached. The adapter included seems rather nice, and screws on to the stock jack rather than snapping, which in my opinion is rather clever. The headphone wire is much thicker than anticipated, but this is definitely a beneficial feature - thin wire = breakage every time.<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY<br />Sound overall is surprisingly good. I have owned two pairs of sub-$15 headphones in the past year and a half. One was a USB gaming headset that I got during black friday sales (should have been $23.99) and the other a cheap pair of headphones from TJ Maxx. Out of the three, the Behringers are by far the nicest sounding headphones. Highs are clear and bright, midtones are decent and the lows are strong. I will say that overall these headphones favor the lower tones, almost too much. A quick adjustment of your computer/phone/mp3 player's software equalizer will fix this. I use Owl City's [[ASIN:B002I53BL0 Fireflies]] as my go-to audio test - it has a broad range of tones - these headphones performed reasonably well. They are clearly not $200 BOSE headphones, nor are they AKG's, however for around ten bucks they are very decent.<br /><br />COMPLAINTS<br />I don't really have any major complaints, at least, not any that are justified. I wish they would have used a less cheap-looking plastic overall, but then again you get what you pay for. I also wish that the cushioning breathed better - you will start to feel warm and clammy in the summer months with these things on! Again, I am sure when it comes to manufacturing these they weren't considering what would be better in terms of materials used.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />If you are looking for a cheap pair of headphones, these are a fantastic choice for the price. I mean, let's be honest here, ten bucks won't even by you a decent lunch where I live! These headphones are relatively comfortable and they have a surprisingly nice sound for the price. Clearly it goes without saying that if you are looking for quality, your search doesn't end here. If however, like me, you don't feel like spending upwards of fifty dollars (or maybe you can't), then I can't find too many reasons for you to not go with these Behringer HPM1000s!

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|had a good time playing game like that I can make it larger. I enjoy hidden objects game from big fish.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|any time I input text on my droid bionic, the keyboard force closes. good app otherwise but that's a huge flaw.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Where to start with the FiiO E7? Let me start by saying that I use this to properly drive my AKG Q701 Headphones. And my goodness, do they do a wonderful job. The bass booster function works marvelously, a very noticeable difference in more bass heavy music such as hip-hop. The long battery life is a huge plus. The fact it is portable is also an advantage. Even when I plug some sub 20 dollar headphones in, there is a significant difference in sound quality and volume compared to just a standard laptop or iPod jack. The screen is well lit, and the user interface is easy to understand and figure out, even without instructions. Who would I recommend this to? Anyone who wants more from their music. Simple as that. If you are going to invest in a nice set of headphones, do yourself a favor and buy this amp. Also, for iPod users, get the FiiO LOD connector. It will bypass your iPods amp and will give you even more sound quality. If you are on the fence, I want this review to push you over. If you buy, you won't regret it. An excellent value, and a 5 out of 5 stars as well.
0439023491|5.0|I'm new to reading.  Never been interested in read, but this series drew me in.  What a great story teller!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|Ever since this album first was read by my cd player, I have been completely addicted. I went out and bought Lateralus as quickly as possible, and I can't stop listening to either. I can tell you right now, from a musician's standpoint, that Tool is one of the best bands I have come into contact in my entire life, and I would daresay that there are none better. Warping from time signature to time signature, key to key, while keeping an insanely articulate rhythm and the most musical chemistry I've ever seen between band members, this is absolutely the most impressive album I have ever heard.
034580404X|5.0|Great series.  I am not much for reading, but after reading this series, there was no stopping me.  The third book was my favorite.  After I finished the series, I think I was in mourning for about a day! I still miss the characters!  Hope to hear more from Christian's point of view!!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I saw this movie first in the theater. I love this story. The flying sequences were by far some of the best. But I love the overall story of Black vs. White back in WW2. I grew up in an area where we didn't have that kind of problem, so the movies of this type really hit me. I think all the actors were perfect for the parts they played. The love angle was typical but the sadness was there also. Over all I would recommed this movie to any war buff and especially ones interested in air battles. When I was in the Army (1961) El Paso Texas, they still had signs saying \\"Whites Only\\" on bathroom doors for public. I couldn't believe the things that were still going on. This movie sheds quite a light on that subject.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and not very hard to play it is addicting and is a great game to play if you need to waste time.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|overall is fun. its got an interesting story and its hidden object games are not super hard. a lot of hints are given in case you need the help but the objects are not hard to find so you should always have extra just in case. over all its a good game.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|good game to pass a few spare minutes.  some images are a real challenge. to find.  has a story line which goes along with the game. isn't suitable for younger players.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Marvel Films had been working toward late April/early May of 2012--and \\"Marvel's The Avengers\\"--since 2003, when the studio did the Ang Lee version of \\"Hulk\\".  The Eric Bana-led story was a fail, but the second swing in 2008--\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" with Edward Norton--was better.  The two \\"Iron Man\\" movies have been brilliantly driven by Robert Downey Jr.'s take on Tony Stark, and \\"Thor\\"--released in the spring of 2011--introduced Chris Hemsworth as the imperious Asgardian Thunder God.<br />  But setting up for the Avengers couldn't be done without introducing Steve Rogers.  Hence, we had the last prequel to \\"The Avengers\\" appear in July of 2011.<br />  To me, it seemed as if Marvel Films and Paramount Studios took an interesting risk in casting Chris Evans to play Steve Rogers.  Evans, to me, seemed dicey here because he had already had a little history in the Marvel Films' Universe--playing Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four films--and also because he seemed to specialize in the smart-alecky slacker type (Jensen in \\"The Losers\\", Ryan in \\"Cellular\\" in addition to Johnny Storm).<br />  As it turned out...I shouldn't have worried.  Evans--in what is essentially the origin story of Captain America--brought the severity and the responsibility of Steve Rogers to the fore, along with a naivete in the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie, when Rogers is the 100-pound physical weakling who is all heart and courage (The CGI that pares Evans down and attaches Evans' head to that small body is a sight to behold).  Once Rogers gets the Super-Soldier serum/Vita-Rays treatment...well, YOU KNOW.<br />  The movie, to a certain extent, plays like a an old Saturday-afternoon serial.  We meet the bad guy--Johann Schmidt and his science/magic related wing of the German Military during WWII, which allows for the introduction of the long-time antagonist group of the Marvel Universe--HYDRA--to be introduced.  Of course, Schmidt has a case of acne gone really bad--havingbeen introduced to the same Super-Soldier formula that turned Rogers into Cap and amplified Rogers' strengths, Schmidt's viciousness and cruelty ends up being amplified in turning him into The Red Skull.  It's a great performance by Hugo Weaving in the introduction of Cap's greatest foe, and the prosthetics are dead on.<br />  This movie also allowed for a fuller fleshing out of the legend of Bucky Barnes.  Rather than go for the \\"Batman/Robin\\" dynamic, Sebastian Stan played James Buchannan Barnes as a young adult; the protector for Steve Rogers pre-formula.  Plus, the introduction of the Howlin' Commandos--sans Nick Fury--was nice.  Neal McDonough gave a solid turn as \\"Dum-Dum\\" Dugan, and Kenneth Choi's Jim Morita was good.<br />  The supporting players were solid, overall.  Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter believes in Steve's heroism.  Stanley Tucci's Abraham Erskine believes in Steve's heart and sense of right.  Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark seems a slightly less manic version of RDJ's Tony.  Tommy Lee Jones...well, he's Tommy Lee Jones, no matter what the role at this point in his career.  In this case, as Colonel Chester Phillips, he is the last to see that Rogers can be the brave and heroic leader of men.  Once he does see it, he embraces it wholly.<br />  Some have called the ending contrived, a vehicle to bring Captain America forward for \\"The Avengers\\".  But the end has been part of the Captain America legend for over 45 years.  It fit into the storyline.<br />  Overall, a wholly entertaining story...and the last piece of the table-setting in preparation for \\"The Avengers\\".<br />  Highly recommended.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in the last five years and now on my all time favorite list!  For those who listened to the critics when this movie first came out you did yourselves a disservice. All those critics seemed to all have the same point words as though they Minh birdied the same review. Makes one wonder if they were too lazy to watch this movie and just followed one another!  One same complaint was they didn't get it and it was too confusing. Well I watched it with my 11 year old granddaughter and she had no problem with it. Maybe when these news outlets hire critics they should have an iq of at least room temperature . I find it sad that people never gave it a chance at the theaters but hope they find out how wonderful  of a film this is!!!!! A must have on DVD!
0345803485|1.0|The only thing that this book did was get me to pray more - pray that I get to the end of it for its ridiculousness, redundancy and absurdity.  I should have gone with my instincts when I read the blurb on here at the beginning of the book; even at that, I could tell the writing was hokey and amateurish.  Save your money, folks.  I definitely learned my lesson and know better than to buy the second and third books.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|As far as hidden object games, this one is above average. Its interesting because it has a.storyline however I am confused by the story,  there doesn't.seem to be a flow howevernit is fun because of the changing scenes and having the ability to increase your hints by finding hidden \\"?\\" in the pictures.  I definitely would recommend anyway.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I've been playing a trial version for the longest and fell in love with this game along with others by G5 Ent.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me so much of Mario brothers except its a littlen leprechaun! very good game, I like it and it is cute too
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I thought it was a well made movie.  If you are not a country music fan then you probably won't enjoy it.  I was very sad at the ending but can see where ALL her life she was exploited esp. by her husband - manager.  The only one who cared about her was Beau.  The songs were great and who knew Gwenyth could sing!  She has a great voice as does the rest of the cast.  I appreciate a movie with \\"extras\\" such as alternate endings and interviews with the cast and crew.  I did not think it drug on as someone had said.  The cast was well picked and played to perfection.  No, it wasn't a blockbuster, yet some of the ones they deam \\"Blockbusters\\" today I would not pay to see even if it was free.  Some of the better movies are ones you just \\"stumble on to\\".  Goes to show that everyone has different tastes!  That is what makes the world such an eclectic place!  At least rent it, give it a chance before you buy it.  I saw it on HBO or some TV movie channel and then wanted to purchase it for my movie collection.  Tty it, you might just like it!
030758836X|3.0|Bought this book based on reviews and the fact that true crime books/shows are something of a guilty pleasure of mine.  I was expecting a twisty whodunit/procedural, but this is more a combo of satire and psychological horror. Don't want to give away spoilers, but the 2nd half of the book veers completely away from the first, and you are then aware of exactly who the main character is (frankly, I found the second half less enjoyable due to the increasing focus on this character).  There are plenty of darkly humorous digs at modern celebrity and the American \\"justice\\" system that really hit the mark. As this was written by a former reviewer for Entertainment Weekly, allusions to pop culture are peppered throughout, particularly film noir and Hitchcock movies.  You may enjoy these references if you're a fan, as I am.<br /><br />If I were to rate the first 3/4 of the book, I'd give it 4 stars, but the ending was pretty much what I'd been expecting the last 20 pages--just drawn out and somewhat disappointing.  I wish the book had stayed a bit more grounded in reality instead of creating a monster that could never possibly exist (as opposed to the media types and lawyers in the book, who seem all the more terrifying because of their basis in reality).<br /><br />Also, the profanity did seem excessive, in particular the derogatory language directed toward women.  Wish modern authors realized that it's really more effective using certain words selectively.  You don't really need to use the same terms over and over and over to portray characters' inner angst or nastiness.<br /><br />My overall rating would be 3 1/2 stars.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is a great Rush album. All the songs are very good and a few are great (Seven Cities of Gold, The Garden). These guys just don't run out of ideas. I saw them on tour last year and and they sound great live too!
B002VLE7UU|5.0|Again, Neil Gaiman reminds me why he is one of my very favorite authors. He just has a way with words, and he weaves stories supremely. Although Coraline is marketed as a children's tale, I stand by the fact the it is a story for all ages. A little bit Alice in Wonderland, a little bit Chronicles of Narnia, a little bit horror movie... Coraline is a creepy tale of a girl that learns of the subtle difference between what she wants and what she thinks she wants when the world she knows is on the line. Chilling and suspenseful, I'd recommend this book to fans of genres from dark fantasy to fairy tales. Seriously, just go read it. I don't care how old you are or what kind of books you normally read, you should give it a try.
B007C4E1R0|5.0|This trio of books weaves together excellent characters and plot into a believable tale that keeps the reader tuned in from the start to the finish. One of the best things about it -- the reader does not have to wait two years to get the next installment! The saddest thing--the author did [[ASIN:0307454568 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Book 3 of the Millennium Trilogy (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]]not live to create a sequel or an additional work either single or multiple volume!
0380789027|4.0|Before I read this book, I was under the impression that I just wasn't really a fan of short stories. This book made me realize that I like short stories just fine, I just have to be a fan of who is writing them. I find Neil Gaiman's style to be dark, gritty and masterful. Smoke and Mirrors is an eclectic collection of stories and poetry about everything from the holy grail to trolls. I think there's a little something for just about anyone that likes fiction. If you like short stories, Neil Gaiman, fantasy, or just want something a little different, you should take a look.
B005K8QIS0|4.0|I was surprised by this fast paced drama. It drops you right in the middle of the story, takes off and keeps on moving. The action isn't wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of each episode. Some mysteries go for several episodes while others don't take long at all. In that respect it's more like real life. However, there is a bit of a McGyver tone to this. Nobody in real life could ever have this much drama, coincidence, knowledge or luck. The fun depends on that being the case though, so just suspend reality and hold on for the ride!<br /><br />The story lines are touching. The viewer gets to see what motivates the main character and how he got where he is today. There are family and love elements that go along with the investigations that give it a bit of depth. The cast was well chosen. They did a good job- I especially loved the darling little girl/daughter! The scenery also captivated me as it is so different from what I am used to seeing.<br /><br />Case Histories is a different kind of detective series that is worth a look... but do leave the subtitles on if you are watching from the USA. Some of the characters are completely unintelligible.
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones was a really good read. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan (avid or casual) of urban fantasy. All of your favorite creatures-demons, vampires, werewolves, angels, warlocks, fairies, demon hunters and more-can be found in this novel. Clare has set up an interesting world full of the supernatural, and some lovable characters to go with it. Be warned however, that there is a major twist at the end of the novel that will turn your perception of several characters upside down! Personally, I was rather frustrated by the twist, but I am interested to see where Clare takes the story from here. City of Bones was an excellent beginning to an adventure saga, and I really look forward to reading the next two books in the sequence.

0439023521|5.0|WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />Oh boy.  I finally see why this book is so popular.  I have been told to read this book by several people, sites, forums, recommendation engines... I finally got around to doing so.  There was a lot I liked about this book.  The most obvious thing that drew me to it was that it was a well-recommended dystopian book with a thrilling survival element.  Once I started reading it, the excitement and emotional involvement kept me coming back.  The survival part of the Games was well-written and entertaining.  I liked the twist of the beasts at the end, as it helps demonstrate how truly sadistic the Capitol is as a whole.  I really enjoyed the character of Katniss.  She is refreshingly self-sufficient and defiant.  I enjoy a good heroine who can hold her own against the best of them, especially when she uses her wits as a weapon.  While Katniss herself feels that she is often uncaring, I think she was just the right level of caring.  She cares for her sister enough to volunteer as tribute in her place, essentially sacrificing her life for Prim's.  She has love for her father in her memories.  She appears to hate her mother on the surface for shutting down and failing to care for the family, but we see glimpses in which Katniss does indeed still love her too.  She cares for Gale.  She cares for Rue deeply, associating her with Prim and trying her best to protect her and avenge her when she fails to do so.  And she does care for Peeta.<br /><br />I found myself able to relate to Katniss surprisingly well with her dealings with Peeta.  Her thoughts about Peeta's actions really tugged on my heartstrings.  When he would do something kind for her, she would repeatedly think that he was just playing into the \\"starcrossed lover act\\" that she thought Haymitch concocted.  Any time she started to feel something, she kept reminding herself that it was just part of the Games, that it wasn't real.  This relates to me on a personal level, because I have some major issues with trust.  This is particularly true with men, and particularly so where relationships are concerned.  Every time she doubted Peeta's motives, I could feel myself in her shoes.  Every time half of me was like \\"can't you see, Katniss?\\", the other half of me was thinking that I have probably very similarly, maybe just as foolishly, disbelieved someone whose motivations were genuine.<br /><br />Although the end left a lot of conflict unresolved (obviously opening for a sequel), I enjoyed what did occur.  I appreciated how Katniss started distancing herself from Peeta on the way home, because she was entirely under the belief that everything that occurred between them was just part of the Games.  I liked Peeta's cold, biting reaction to her hurting him, and I very much look forward to seeing what occurs between them, and between the other characters when the District 12 victors return home.have some major issues with trust.

0312641893|4.0|Cinder is utterly original, with stunningly familiar glimpses of a recognizable fairy tale.  The story is indeed a retelling of Cinderella, but it is so much more.  Meyer creates a world where humans and androids coexist in the crowded city of New Beijing.  However, the androids and the cyborgs are sub-class citizens, considered property of their wards.  Even if cyborgs are mostly human, they are not allowed money, possessions, or freedom.  A deadly plague called leutomosis is cutting its way through the population, affecting humans and cyborgs alike, sowing panic and fear through the city in its wake.<br /><br />Lihn Cinder is New Beijing's best mechanic, but she is a cyborg.  She knows little to nothing about her past, only that she was left by her stepfather in her stepmother's care when he succumbed to the plague.  Her stepmother continues to rue the day her husband left her with such a creature.  When one of her daughters falls ill, she is quick to blame the cyborg mutant she has been saddled with.  Cinder is caught between a past she doesn't remember, a future she doesn't know how to deal with, a doctor who holds the key to more knowledge about her than she possesses, and an alarmingly friendly prince who enters her life but doesn't know the first thing about her darkest secrets.  With the constant threat of the cunning, ruthless Lunars looming ever closer, both Prince Kai and Cinder must make some very difficult decisions, and pray that they will not do something they regret.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer's debut effort is a clear success.  Although the premise originally sounds outlandish, she succeeds in building a world, atmosphere, characters and relationships that make the story not only acceptable, but captivating and immersive.  This novel is so much more than a simple retelling of the Cinderella fairy tale, but every time a parallel arises, it is a pleasure to recognize the similarities.  I had solved most of the novel's mysteries and twists long before they presented themselves, but this did not impact my enjoyment of the story.  The only real flaws I picked out were a few instances of incorrect word choices or phrasings or spellings that momentarily disrupted my immersion in the book.  One such example is \\"coy pond\\", which put me in mind of the Twitter account, @stealthmountain.  But these are small, nitpicky things.  The story itself was very well-crafted, original, and entertaining.  I would recommend it to fans of science fiction, androids, plagues, fairy tale retellings, and those just looking for something different.

0765357151|4.0|When the modern film adaptation I Am Legend came out in 2007, many people were annoyed or angered by the movie.  I heard things like, \\"it's nothing like the book\\", \\"the ending sucks\\" and \\"it misses the point\\".  Now I know why.  Let me just tell you, the movie does miss the point, particularly with the theatrical ending.  That version of the film misses the point like the missing the broad side of a barn  with a tactical nuke at point-blank range.  That's not to say I dislike the movie.  I thought that, with the alternate ending, it was pretty good.  I still think that.  However, reading the original story has changed my feelings about it a bit, namely that I like certain things about it less than the novel.  Now, I don't remember if the credits say \\"based on I Am Legend by Richard Matheson\\", but if they do, I believe they definitely commit the crime of false advertising.  The most it should say is \\"inspired by...\\"  The only similarities I can think of between the book and what I remember of the movie are:<br /><br />  The main character is named Robert Neville<br />  There is a plague of vampires that led to the collapse of civilization<br />  The main character is a human man, ostensibly the last on earth, who is immune to the disease<br />  The main character lost his wife and child after/during the outbreak of the disease<br />  There is a dog<br />  There is a woman<br />  There is science<br /><br />But enough about the film!  Overall, I enjoyed the novel.  I was not initially aware that the novel I purchased contained I Am Legend in addition to several short stories, because it was not clearly advertised on my edition.  Thus, I was surprised that the story was as short as it was.  I only read I Am Legend from the bunch, because that is the reason I purchased it.  I feel like Matheson could have made the book longer, and fleshed out the world, the situations, and Neville's past quite a bit more.<br /><br />One thing about the story that I wasn't a huge fan of was how little actually happened in the book.  A big portion of the narrative was devoted to the more mundane events and inner monologues in the post-apocalyptic life of Robert Neville.  On the other hand, much of the narrative dealing with Neville's inner thoughts helped vastly with the world-building.  Through Neville's erratic, desperate, hopeless thoughts, the reader developed a taste for what it felt like to be the last man on earth, living a daily battle for existence in the midst of a plague of vampires, having lost everyone and everything you once loved.<br /><br />However, that brings me to my next point -- Neville was surprisingly unfeeling.  I don't know if the reader was supposed to chock that up to him being a man who doesn't want to display feelings, his being a man that has given up hope, or what.  He faced situations with very little sympathy, or even horror, and seemed largely apathetic about what was happening to him and what he was doing.  Throughout several places in the story, I got the idea that Matheson has issues with women.  I know that authors don't always write their thoughts into their characters, but it didn't seem like Neville was supposed to be especially misogynistic, because the author wrote it strictly as if his thoughts were fact and entirely acceptable.<br /><br />There were some things I really liked about I Am Legend.  First off, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read.  As a biology major and pharmacy student, I found it incredibly interesting to read about Neville's discoveries and experiments as he uncovered the origin of the disease.  That Matheson invented a somewhat scientifically sound background for the existence of vampires, debunking some elements of mythology and supporting others was original and pleasing to me.<br /><br />The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending.  The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me.  I wasn't expecting what happened, at all.  It is very much the most important part of the novel.  It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe.  I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.<br /><br />It is an unimportant detail, but I also enjoyed that the last line of the novel was \\"I am legend.\\"  I love when books really come full circle, and when they have their title worked into them somehow.  Matheson managed to do both, and it brought a smile to my face.ut of left field for me.  I wasn't expecting what happened, at all.  It is very much the most important part of the novel.

B006L4MWVE|3.0|I have read so much about this film and what i read had disturbed me. Kids having to kill each other until their entire classroom is dead and only one survives. It sounds like a twisted concept and a film that would haunt you long after you've watched it. Well it didn't. At least for me it didn't. The acting wasn't bad at all and the english dub was much better than I've heard in most japanese films but the effects were kinda weak. Many gunshots were badly computer animated and even the more simple effects weren't very well done. Maybe i was just expecting to be shocked because i had heard and read so much or maybe that is why i wasn't. I don't honestly know but all in all it wasn't very intense. Instead I recommend The Running Man or Surviving The Game.
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium  is a fantastic sequel, well worth the wait.  It is a well-crafted page-turner chock full of action, survival, rebellion, emotion and romance.  The new characters introduced in this novel are interesting and have just the right amount of depth.  Lena's development is fierce and believable.  She forges ahead, strong and determined to figure out who the real Lena is after everything that has shaped her.  Just when she thinks she's about certain, life throws another giant wrench in her way.  The cliffhanger at the end of this novel is to die for.<br /><br />One storytelling technique I really like when it is well done is that of alternating between the past and the present.  I think it can be a very efficient, exciting way to tell a backstory.  Oliver uses the technique seamlessly in this novel.  Pandemonium begins directly where the events of Delirium left off.  These chapters form the \\"then\\" chapters.  The other half of the story begins with Lena on a mission, forming the \\"now\\" chapters.  The events that take place during these chapters still occur in chronological order.  The threads of this story are braided, each alternating to come forth and tell a part of Lena's story.  The transitions are well-timed and make a lot of sense.<br /><br />I'd recommend Pandemonium to anyone that read Delirium.  This sequel is well worth your while.

0060853972|4.0|I've had this book sitting on my shelf for a good long while, but I never got around to reading it.  I bought this book along with several other Gaiman novels several years ago, shortly after I read Neverwhere and realized how much I like his writing.  Reading the excerpt of this book, I thought it sounded quite interesting, very absurd, and like it would be a book I would rather enjoy.  So why did it take me so long to read it?  I guess I just don't read a lot of straight-up humor books.  However, I decided to try something different after the heaping dose of angst I'd gotten from many of the other books I'd read recently.<br /><br />I can't say that I regret my decision -- Good Omens is great fun.  Within the first few pages, I found myself thinking that I had found Monty Python in book form.  In short, Good Omens is a story an angel, Aziraphale and a demon, Crowley, unlikely friends since the incident in the Garden of Eden, who are none too eager for the coming apocalypse.  Things go quite pear-shaped when an unwitting loquacious Satanic nun accidentally misplaces the Antichrist.  Peppered with appreciable British humor, Good Omens is at once slyly funny and cleverly pokes at the mores of religion and society in general.<br /><br />There were so many little touches in this book that I appreciated.  However, it is not flawless.  There were points in the middle of the novel where the humor slowed down almost to a stop.  Some passages seemed a bit tedious, and others just didn't make very much sense to me.  I will admit, I have never read any Terry Pratchett before, so I am unsure if it is a symptom of me not liking or not being used to his writing, or if it is simply due to the fact that this is a collaboration of two (from what I understand) quite different authors.  Overall, though, Good Omens is a rollicking good time, and I'd recommend it to fans of British humor that need a good cheering up.

0439023491|4.0|Collins does it again. This addition to the Hunger Games series is another emotional rollercoaster and a joyride of unexpected twists and turns. Catching Fire continues the journey of Katniss and those she knows. As expected, it is not an easy path. I enjoyed the new characters, and appreciated the development with the old. Some of the twists I realized before Katniss, but others were quite unexpected. Overall, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who read the first novel, fans of dystopian fiction, science fiction, young adults, and anyone that thinks they might like the series. You won't be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A compelling plot, tightly intelligent writing, twisted ending... All in one book. I wish I could write half as well.
B0056E3S4U|5.0|I have had this record for nearly a year now & listen to it just about everyday. every song on it will take you on some kind of journey. They are all fantastic songs that I cannot pick a favorite it all depends on the mood I am in for that day when I listen to it. I did get the chance to hear a few before the record was released and I have to say that they hold a special place in my heart. David Cook's voice is so rich with emotion that no matter if he is singing about heartbreak or love you can feel these emotions with him as he takes you on the journey of this record. If you listen from the beginning to the end you will be taken on a journey of a relationship in a dream. The opening song Circadian sets the tone for this relationship and it carries you through it until the end of Rapid Eye Movement the end of said relationship.  Even though each song does flow into each other each and everyone of them stands up on there own. And you can take whatever meaning you want or need from each song. David has always said he wanted people to interrupt and get out of his music whatever it is for them. And this is what I have always done. So do your self a favor and pic up a copy of this fantastic record.

The game itself is engaging -- it's fun creating the village, moving stuff around and enough new stuff is added at each level to make it interesting.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|Lets face it, I'm a big Joe Bonamassa fan. In my opinion, he can't do anything wrong.  This is his 13th album and it is another winner.<br /><br />One thing that I have noticed is that as time goes by and by listening to the covers that he puts out, you get a better feel for his influences. More and more blues influences in my opinion. Howling Wolf, Robert Johnson, you can't get more back to the blues than that. He can take 75 year old songs and make them current, bringing them to a whole new audience.<br /><br />Early 60's British and American blues influences is what you will be exposed to by this release and as usual Joe packs the recording studio with an all-star line-up of accompanying musicians. Anton Fig, Michael Rhodes, Brad Whitford, Harrison Whitford and Blondie Chaplin to name a few.<br /><br />To quote Joe, \\"Every one of my records has a word associated with it,\\" Bonamassa, who released the album in May, tells Billboard.com. \\" 'The Ballad of John Henry' (2009), that was swampy. 'Dust Bowl' (2011), that was 'Americana.' 'Black Rock' (2010) was 'worldly.' This was simply blues, 'Let's go back and make a straight-ahead blues album -- as straight ahead as we can make it, which is still not technically blues but is close enough.' That was the idea this time.\\"<br /><br />This album sees Joe returning to his blues roots in a huge way. Over twelve years after his first album he has become one of the foremost blues guitarists in the world and has played among exceptional company during that time. Three original cuts and eight cover tracks each with a distinct JB signature feel to them.<br /><br />If you are a fan of blues classics or modern electric blues this album and Joe Bonamassa is the artist for you. Another great blues album by JB, have a listen to [[ASIN:B0000AKCLS Blues Deluxe]]

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Diana Bishop's life takes a drastic turn when she calls up an ancient manuscript from Oxford's library. She is a descendant of a long line of witches, and the book recognizes her. She opens it up and finds the creatures of the paranormal are now following her. They all want the book, but no one has been able to find it, until she shows up. Now her life is in danger.<br /><br />The most persistent paranormal creature is a vampire. His name is Matthew and he begins to follow her everywhere. But soon realizes that his interest is not just academic.<br /><br />When I started to read this story, it seemed like it would be pretty straight forward. I soon realized that there are many levels to the story. Deborah Harkness has weaved a tale with many layers. This is not a book to read in one sitting. It took me several days to read and comprehend.<br /><br />I recommend this book only to adults. There is violence, and intimacy that isn't graphic.

I was and always will remain as a fan, and even if I felt unfulfilled with their last album, I still purchased it for the hope that it would be awesome.  :(<br /><br />With that being said, Linkin Park has stepped back into their roots and created an album that ANY person would enjoy.

B00846REIS|1.0|This book is a rip off off...from the cover to the characters...a lame attempt to profit from the success of the fifty shades.  But the problem isn't even that. The characters aren't likable. Ava seems sweet, and while its cool that she lives a fairytale life, hasnt a care in the world, the author's attemps to make her human by throwing in a few gratuitous phone calls with her cop dad are so transparent and only serve to confuse the character. Gideon, who by description doesnt even sound hot (long hair?) is a total loser.  12 billion dollars (um we never really learn what he does) can't make cool his awkward teenage boy porn talk (what guy refers to his girlfriends vagina as a c--t)!!!  They never develop as a couple. They just do it all freakin day. There really is no plot. We just follow these two idiots as they have sex then fight, have sex then fight. Ugh! It's exhausting!  The author actually tries to make child sexual abuse the underlying theme of the book, but fails miserably...we don't even know exactly what happened to Gideon.  The theme of the book is more like \\"how raunchy and shocking can we try to make these sex scenes for all the women coming down off the fifty high.\\"<br /><br />Maybe if i hadnt just read the fifty trilogy... Maybe if i wasnt just looking for more christian and ana i wouldnt have been so annoyed. But i had and i was, so i really hated this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Attention grabbing; mystifying; entertaining; exasperating; totally readable; give yourself a treat on your summer vacation.  Gillian Flynn has created some incredibly complex characters in believable settings.  This is a story in which only these characters could participate. Providing story details would possibly ruin the twists and turns in this novel.  This is the first piece by Ms. Flynn I have read.  If I now go to some of her first publications I hope I'm not disappointed as I compare it to this very entertaining novel. I don't usually write reviews but based on my experience with \\"Gone Girl\\", I had to comment.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This damn movie is just phenomenal. I have seen it about thirty times and I still watch it like its the first time. I liked bruce in this one than batman even though I love what they did with his suit. The bank heist scene was very clever the way joker had everybody kill each other and he walk away with all the cash. My fav part of all time? When batman busts out of the tumbler on the batcycle. I freakin love it. This movie is the only thing I have to keep me satisfied until rises comes out. Let me tell you folks that that movie is going to be a monumental event of our time. Right up there with the first black president being elected. I think chris nolan has become one of my favorite directors and I will be anxous to see what he does next.

It's a bit short, but I urge any LP fanatic to take a listen, especially those that enjoyed their earlier discs, and not the more recent ones.  I pirated it [admittedly], but I liked it so much, I decided to pre-order. Great CD, wish there were a few more tracks on it though!<br /><br />Personal Faves gotta be Roads Untraveled and Powerless.

1451627289|4.0|This book was suggested to me by family. I am normally not much of a Stephen King fan, in fact this was the first book I have read in it's entirety by him. I can honestly say I was mildly suprised.<br /><br />The story is excellent. First rate concept and presentation. I will not go in to the story line, it's been done many times in different reviews here. I will say that King makes some interesting propositions regarding time travel, time lines and effects. It's no master of sci-fi treatise on it but it fits very well with this novel. I give the book as a story a 4+ stars in concept alone.<br /><br />King's writing is not very poetic or artistic. He is no Kafka or Dostoevsky. He is however a very compelling story teller. I did not find myself bored at all while reading this novel, and it is quite lengthy. I can say, however, it was something I could easily put down and come back to later on. One aspect I will say about King is that he takes situations that would otherwise cause me to drop a book almost entirely due to boredom and keep a spark of interest alive. That does take talent. He definitely won me over with this novel.<br /><br />Overall a 4 star read. Great story line, compelling characters and well written. Don't be intimidated by it's size it's well worth the undertaking.
0765316994|3.0|Although I like Scalzi's writing and topics, this one was just not quite up to his usual standards.<br /><br />Yes, it was quite funny (given the topic - ensigns on a starship keep dying on away missions, yet the \\"main characters\\" always survive - how could it not be?), filled with Scalzi's typical realistic dialogue (think: Buffyspeak). But I think he might have bitten off more than he could chew with this \\"high concept\\" piece. Sadly, it's one of those cases where the concept of the work is better than the work itself (think: any Christopher Moore book).<br /><br />Additionally, it seemed too short - more of a novella than a regular-sized novel (or maybe I just read it too quickly).<br /><br />I enjoyed it, and I do think it is worth reading (especially for the three codas - that was an interesting literary challenge, with varying degrees of success), although not as good as the Old Man's War series. In fact, not even as complete and well-done as Fuzzy Nation or The Android's Dream. (To be fair, he is one of my favorite authors, so maybe I'm just expecting too much from him now.)<br /><br />Read it - you'll enjoy it (just not as much as most of his other books).
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed the game but was able to complete it in one afternoon so found it somewhat monotonous. but its an ok app
076535618X|5.0|This is a great mash-up of sci-fi thriller and frontier living, with plenty of strategizing against intrigue.<br />If you like the first 2 books of the \\"Old Man's War\\" trilogy, you will be very pleased with how this one ends (as well as the \\"alternate perspective\\" book, \\"Zoe's Tale\\").<br /><br />Throughly enjoyable and made a lifelong Scalzi fan out of me.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Very moving account of the awful experiences suffered by a victim of a child abduction. In my opinion, she is alive today due to her intelligence and wits. I marvel at the fact that she,another as a young child and young adult, displayed such strength and courage.  I've no doubt that many people will find hope and be encouraged after reading this incredible tale.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book.  It's disturbing  but very well written and hard to put down.  I have finished the series and I can't believe how the author came up with such a unique story line.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This wasn't exactly the great movie but it has a clever premise (based on an Edgar Rice Burrows novel) that is really kind of a victorian/old west era sci-fi story with strong parallels to James Cameron's Avatar. John Cater is transported to Mars while trying to escape conscription by the Army in their fight against Native Americans.  There he is thrust into a similar situation, this one involving two warring human cities and another alien species that is caught in the middle and cares little for either side.  The movie manages to make some social commentary while at the same not being heavy handed. I found it to be suitably entertaining with good dialogue and decent acting.  The story starts to get bogged down a bit by its own tenuousness leading to a rather rushed and over-simplified conclusion but overall it's a pretty satisfying movie.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan since the very beginning, and I had all of their albums.  So, when I heard that they had come out with a new album with new songs, I had to get it.  I was not disappointed.  I felt like I was back in high school.  Any Beach Boys fan will like this album and there are several songs that rival their greatest hits from the '60's and '70's.  The classic harmonies are there.  This could have been a real let down, but I am so happy that it was so great.  It made me feel like 16 again, and that's ain't bad!

0099579936|1.0|I've never written a review before, but after reading this book and the second and third, sad to say I'm embarrassed that the following two books were purchased. I bought the next two in the trilogy because initially, I thought the author did a very good job portraying the mixed up, messed up psychopath/stalker Christian Grey. So I was curious as to how this whole drama would play out. Yes, I know this is fantasy and erotica but this was so totally twisted that I had to comment. I was looking for sensual, not cruel.<br />I'm not an expert in psychology but that being said this trilogy perpetuates certain mythical ideas. Briefly that those with sadistic tendencies change and that they will change by seeking mental health counseling. As far as I know it is rare for violent individuals to commit to therapy. These types do not relish the idea of playing an inferior to the superior authority figure psychologist/psychiatrist. Granted he had wonderful adopted parents (too perfect to be true)but even Grey admitted to being sadistic and hurting one or two of his subs. Sadistic,disturbed individuals don't change their sadistic tendencies. Isn't a 21st century relationship supposed to be based on equality? Or am I being totally archaic in my beliefs?. Fifty Shades is giving a nod of approval to the dom/sub lifestyle. What I found fascinating about this is that Ana had to sign an nondisclosure agreement,yet this agreement is non-legally binding between two consenting adults. On the one hand there are \\"safe\\" words, the agreement is consensual, yet the sub is not allowed to disclose the dark side. What is the dominant figure trying to hide? His/Her sadistic tendencies of course. I object to the attempt to push this type of relationship into the mainstream literary world. The main character continues to be controlling and young Ana continues to give in. She continues,for the most part, to play the role of the submissive. Why? Well, because he's so sexy and hot of course. This bookalso perpetuates the idea that the love, particularly of a good, albeit somewhat klutzy young woman will cure all. Men like Christian Grey get bored really quickly and move on to the next available arm candy. They don't stay mesmerized by one woman. Sorry it just doesn't happen. Dr. Flynn summed it up by saying that Christian was still an adolescent. Some things never change, right ladies? Again, this is suppose to be for erotic entertainment, I get that. Another over-used fantasy which enthralls young women is the luxury and generosity associated with the main character Christian. In reality, these super-rich men are tightwads. They may appear generous but they use their generosity to impress others and aggrandize themselves. This kind of fantasy is okay, but just see it for what it is: pure fantasy/fluff. Again some young women may truly take this to heart. How many times does she sit on his lap? Too many to count. Is he her daddy? She is trying to find out who she is outside of HIS world, and he keeps thwarting that effort. Look before you leap, because realistically this guy is playing Russian Roulette where disease is concerned because of his promiscuous behavior. Likewise, his brother Eliot. True he gets tested, but again this sends subtle messages to younger people. Sorry to be giving a sermon, but I found this to be disappointing and troubling. Write erotica for erotica's sake if you must, but stop sending such misleading messages to young women. While you are reading it keep in mind how much reality is being distorted.<br /><br />$$$$$$Bottom Line$$$$$$ Christian Grey blankets Ana with himself and uses his pathological neediness by way of sex to chain her to him. When you are her age (22 years young) and your hormones are in overdrive, and you don't know who you are, you are at great risk for being exploited. Let's see how fulfilled and productive Ana is 3 decades from now.

B005FISBTO|5.0|I am a Dexter Fan, that's why I buy the DVD's.  I watch from the beginning when a new season comes out.  Every season is DIFFERENT and it's a good thing.  The new bad guys mix it up. Dexter is evolving and learning more about himself and how Harry's code serves him and his Dark Passenger.  The other characters are also evolving and we have a real interest in them because the writers are careful to keep them true. This season challenges Dexter as a father and human.  It's natural that he questions a higher power at work. He IS human after all and seeks answers as his life has moves forward.  I was feeling that Rita was a manipulator and not a soul mate.  Poor Dexter thought the Jimmy Smitts' character was a soul mate in friend form, but he was betrayed. Lumen was a soul mate of sorts but got past her \\"need\\" and needed the light of hope again. We watch to see how Dexter moves forward to get a real life and make a life for his son.  Season six adds pieces to this puzzle in a gory and exciting adventure for everyone at Miami Metro.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the story line and it doesn't get \\"dirty\\" right away like many people are saying. In fact it doesn't do really anything until around chapter 7. So those who read 20% of the book, in my opinion, did not give the book a chance. That being said, personally I really enjoyed the storyline. Normally with these types of books you get great \\"scenes\\" but a horrible storyline. I was actually enjoying the storyline and honestly the ending left me a little shocked and craving the next book (which I bought within seconds after finishing the first). The main character in the book is \\"pure\\" in a sense and so this is really about her experiences into the world of sex and pleasure, and so while some of the parts may seem cheesy, you have to again think back to who this main character is. That inner goddess of hers is her subconsious finally being free and letting her experience something new. The book has many funny parts and some very relatable when it comes to relationships and dating. Love it and working on the second. :D

B00125JP1C|3.0|This movie was alright, mostly over the top, but watchable. Really the entire movie consisted of me thinking to myself, \\"That poor baby!\\" and watching Clive Owen slip, slide and jump around while shooting at bad guys. This is definitely rental/one-time-watch.
0553801473|2.0|All has been said about this mess but I add my two cents anyway - and my two stars as well.<br /><br />GRRM was once a great writer, up until the year 2000 with the publication of Storm of Swords. Then he ceased to be a writer, became a travelling salesman and is now living of the glory of the past (and HBO) like a vulture from the rotten carcass of a prize horse. How fitting that the 2000th review of Dance with Dragons tells YOU - potential reader -  how it truly is: Don't Buy This Book, it's a giant hoax. Filler ridden, no plot, character retardation etc etc.<br /><br />Don't let yourself be fooled by the astonishing number of 5* reviews, about half of them are fake and bough for $5 a piece. Very easy to discern as well. Normally this book would deserve 1,5* top so I am quite generous here with my 2*. Why this? Call it nostalgia for the good old times when GRRM was still a writer (and the Theon story arc is quite good.)<br /><br />And in closing: Professional critics and HUGO, LOCUS juries etc.: do yourself a favour and reward a book by its quality and not by its sales numbers. You'll lose all credibility otherwise. Thank you.<br /><br />Bye George, it was quite a ride. But it's over now. Enjoy your wealth.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|regardless of what age you are, the key to survival is the ability to adapt in the face of adversity.  true, it gets harder as one ages but it is the same challenge, just more demanding at this time in life.  for various reasons, mostly financial, various elderly Brits transplant themselves to India. they all stay at a rundown hotel and try to adapt to it, the country and the culture.  some do it better than others and the difference seems to be in attitude. this crew of seniors is made up of a who's who of british acting: Judi Densch, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, etc., they are all splendid.<br /><br />the reason this is four stars instead of five is that the script is not as stellar as the cast. it could have moved at a better pace and had better, snappier dialogue. we know these actors are up to the task of such a script. nevertheless, they make this material work and it is an enjoyable film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is horrible. Certainly do NOT shell out a dime to read it; if you must know what all the fuss is about, get it on loan. Terrible, horrible, juvenile writing, absurdly one-dimensional characters, and the sex isn't nearly exciting enough to make it worth the eye-rolling frustration of the prose. This woman should have kept her child-like fantasy between her husband and herself; though then she wouldn't be making millions off of the sub-standard taste of many readers. LAME!

B003Y5HWJU|4.0|I did not view Boardwalk Empire on its original HBO run, instead waiting until the DVD set came out and watching the show in two and three episode blocks.  But I did read many reviews when the show was airing and quite a few of them expressed disappointment that Boardwalk Empire was not the second coming of The Sopranos, or that it did not surpass that TV classic because legendary director Martin Scorsese was attached to the show since Scorsese is to the the gangster genre what John Ford was the the western.  Also many complained of the show's slow pace and how the story seemed to take a long time getting anywhere.<br /><br />I took all of this in mind when I sat down to watch Boardwalk Empire for myself, and I must say the critics had a point up to a point.  The first few episodes take their time introducing the characters, showing us their position in 1920's society and how they all relate to one another; the writer Terrence Winter takes care to set the stage as we are introduced to Nucky Thompson, the treasurer of Atlantic City and how his world works in 1920 at the dawn of Prohibition. By episodes 4 and 5 the stage has been set as Nucky, who controls all the bootlegging in Atlantic City plus the rum running as well, has to contend with such dangerous rivals as Arnold Rothstein and Lucky Luciano in New York and revenue agents right on his own doorstep.  As the fortunes from the illegal liquor trade pile up, so do the bodies.  By the end of the first season we have been given a ringside seat at the creation of modern organized crime in America and understand how it would prosper in the coming decades, long after Prohibition was repealed.<br /><br />The acting is first rate, starting with Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson, a man who is many things: hypocrite, accessory to murder and pillar of the community.  Buscemi has been a great actor in supporting roles for the past two decades, but he really shines as the lead here, looking like he stepped right off the front page of a 1920's newspaper; with his knowing look and sharp eyes, Buscemi never lets us forget that Nucky is always the smartest guy in the room.  I especially liked Kelly MacDonald as Margaret Shroeder, the hard luck woman who comes into Nucky's life; Margaret's story is most compelling as it portrays the often tough circumstances women found themselves in back in the supposed good old days.  There is great work by Michael Pitt as Jimmy, Nucky's less than grateful surrogate son; the always intense Michael Shannon as revenue agent Nelson Van Alden, a man way to into his work; Stephen Graham as a young Al Capone; Michael Stuhbarg as the ever too slick Arnold Rothstein, the man who fixed the World Series; Vincent Piazzia as Lucky Luciano, who hooks up at one point with Jimmy's amorous mother, played by Gretchen Mol.  And there is a great role for Dabney Coleman as the Commodore, a grossly evil old man who is Nucky's predecessor in Atlantic City.  Coleman's character has a few things in common with John Huston's nasty Noah Cross from \\"Chinatown.\\"<br /><br />There is great attention to detail, the sets and costumes almost overwhelm the story at times; there's also plenty of graphic violence and lots of skin, including some unexpected lesbian action.  But the scene that sticks in my mind the most comes in the season finale when Nucky tells Margaret about his late wife and the sad fate that befell her and their infant son, and we learn there is much more to this man than what we have seen.<br /><br />I'v always felt that if you are going to make a period piece about the 1920's and 30's, you have to at least reach the bar set by \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" and \\"The Untouchables,\\" two genuine masterpieces about that era; I'm not sure Boardwalk quite reaches that level, but as a recreation of that time and place, plus a great history lesson on how corrupt local government in the United States was (is), Boardwalk Empire does deliver the goods.

B005LAIGNC|5.0|Historically accurate. Though it's hard to believe the Red Tails shot down German JETS with their P-51 Mustangs, it's been well documented elsewhere.<br />Computer generated graphics have reached a real high point, and the dogfights look REAL! Those Jets bearing down on you at 600 miles an hour, with cannons blazing make you squirm in your seat. Dolby Surround sound well done as well. puts you right in the middle of the air war. Plenty of action interwoven with a nice romance and interpersonal stuff. Acting is first rate. Has  a bit of the style of the classic WWII propaganda flicks, but much more realism, and of course it's based on a true story. These guys were really amazing. They had to be twice as good--and they were.<br />The movie does not dwell on the racism faced by the Tuskegee airmen, but it's there, in the background.<br />Well done flick. Top flight!<br />I really dug this movie, and so did my wife.<br />Looked great in the theatre, and the Blu-Ray DVD looked and sounded just as great in my home theater as well.<br />Highly recommended.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I came to this book by way of the author's Dear Sugar columns, which I adore. This writing gives some background on the personal stories shared in Cheryl's columns, making them fit together as a whole. The story of Cheryl's trek along the Pacific Crest Trail is inspring and carefully told; her apparent memory for detail regularly amazed me, and her determination and grit in the face of serious obstacles astonished me. My only wish is that I had read this book earlier, when I first downloaded it, so that I might have had time to plan a PCT hike of my own for this summer. I have a hunch that the trail will see a spike in the number of people hiking in the wake of such a great book.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am very pleased that I purchased this app. My guess is that writing programs are limited on the tablet market, but gave this one a shot. Wow, certainly not on par with MS Word, but capable of creating documents as quickly as I can type. So far I've managed to produce no less than 30 pages, at my leisure, in different atmospheres like inside/outside, lights on or off. It's great! Because my skills are low, it would be nice if spell check were present, but that won't stop me. I can also tranfer files easily from and to my laptop via usb, with the format maintained. (That's where I spell check) I have viewed Exel files, but haven't tried to manipulate them yet, my tablet is only 7\\", so spreadsheet work really isn't very practical. Writing on it is a gas, though, and I plan to have tons more fun using it!
B003K16P3M|5.0|I whipped my way through this book in a matter of days. The world was well-realized, with interesting quirks to wrap your mind around, and the characters were enjoyable to get to know and love. Occasionally, plot points would be pretty obvious (could it have taken them longer to have the King epiphany?), but that's fine by me. Very enjoyable read.
B006ISJQ26|5.0|I loved this movie.  Colin Farrell is a hunk!  It was refreshing to see an actor look handsome, his very best!  Kiera K.  is also lovely, but she needs to put on a few pounds.  The acting was great, story fast paced and interesting.  Very good movie.  I would love another!!
B000060O58|5.0|The Brandenburgs are played with great elan by this excellent chamber orchestra, undoubtedly stocked w/ many BRSO players from its Jochum and Kubelik eras. Richter also plays the great keyboard cadenza in #5. The flute playing in #4, trumpet in #2, viola and cello in #6: all superb. This ranks with my favorite set , that of Karl Ristenpart on a four cd set<br />(worth it for the three-violin concerto.)  I do prefer the fillers on the 2 cd Richter Brandenburgs, the concerto for oboe d'amore and strings and especially the concerto for violin and oboe with is seraphic second movement.<br /><br />The suites are almost as good. #4 is the most successful, ripped by spirited horns and trumpets. #s 1 and 2 ( the flute Suite) are close, and a #3 played like #4 would have lifted this box immeasurably-it is a bit too tame for me, especially in the first movement for which I was spoiled by a solo violin in the concertante section rather than  unison violins,<br />once by a Szell/Cleveland disc and once, as I recall, by Munchinger.  This box is a great buy and it is still best to live with \\"The Birthmark\\". And the second Brandenburg #5, aka the triple concerto for flute, violin, and keyboard ( owned by Ristenpart I think), makes some amends

B0079XPUOW|3.0|Fans of the original Star Trek series already know the significance of wearing a red shirt on that show. For those of us who prefered girls to Vulcans, an explanation might be useful. With the exception of Scottie, wearing a red shirt on the original series was a sure-fire sign that your character was not going to live long. Redshirts, as they're affectionately referred to by Comicon attendees and the like, were always falling victim to some disaster or battle with the enemies of the United Federation of Planets. John Scalzi has taken that little bit of Trekipedia and written a very entertaining book.<br /><br />Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Intrepid, the flagship of the Universal Union. But he quickly begins to notice that all is not right aboard the ship. Rarely does an away mission return without having lost at least one of his fellow low-ranking members of the crew to some battle with aliens. And while the key officers are often critically -- and usually in a dramatic fashion, injured on these missions, they never seem to share the same fate as their subordinates.<br /><br />Dahl and his fellow ensigns begin to investigate what's really going on with the Intrepid and come to a realization that is as surprising as it is brilliant.<br /><br />That secret makes the book well worth the short amount of time it will take to read it. And you don't need to be a big fan of the series to enjoy it and to be able to pick up on what Scalzi's intentions were in writing it. If you liked Galaxy Quest, you'll like this. I've never cared for the original series myself. I have seen most of The Next Generation series and I liked all of the even-numbered movies that they've made. But even with that limited interest in Star Trek, I thought the book was a lot of fun and it made me interested in reading more of what Scalzi has written.
B0009A1B9A|3.0|This is a very good album, especially for a debut, so I was excited to see a DualDisc, hoping for better sound quality than the original CD and also a 5.1 mix. Unfortunately, the DVD side is \\"enhanced\\" stereo, not a 5.1 mix. I REALLY wish Amazon would distinguish that in their detail pages. I have been burned twice now on discs that were SACD or DualDisc, and was expecting a surround sound version. Maybe this album just wasn't recorded or mixed that well to begin with, because even the \\"enhanced\\" stereo didn't sound that great and not much better than a standard CD. I have a decent two channel system and very good CD and pretty good DVD universal player. Not very impressed by the sound. If you love this album, probably worth the purchase...there is a good documentary included.Otherwise stick with the CD.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a fast paced game that is always changing. The need and want to beat your last score keeps you wanting just one more run
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Saw this when it came out and I was pleased as usual. The action great, the story great, and it was a great mixture of comedy at just the right time. It did take a bit for everything to come together but it all worked out and became an exciting film. Will definitely be getting this on blu ray!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was really a great story. It took me a while to pick it up and read it- especially after reading all the bad reviews. But I read books to relax and have fun, and if a great ride is what you are looking for, Fifty Shades definately delivers. I like to read about heros and heroines who grow and evolve during the story, and even though there is plenty of kinky sex (trust me, it is pretty hot!) what really made me fall in love was how much the characters matured throughout the story. Stories that really touch my heart usually involve characters that NEED to be together but somehow have almost every insurmountable obstacle thrown at them. Christian and Ana would never have fallen in love if it wasnt for all the flaws they each have. If you can get past the fact that the writing is amateur, the story is lovely and you will want to read it again and again.<br />That being said, prepare yourself for it is obvious that this is the author's first book. I feel like if she would have had a good editor, these books would have been even better...then again, it is written from a really immature 21-year old female's perspective, so in that sense it is very realistic. All in all I though it was a great investment of my $30, and I will definately be reading it again.<br />P.S. I can't wait for the author's next book \\"Fifty Shades of Christian\\" (which is this exact story written from Christian's perspective) to come out...not to mention the movie!

B004EBT6HE|4.0|With this review, I did something I usually don't do, I read many of the reviews that where already written first. and I am sad for a lot of these reviewers, because they did not lose themselves in the reading. Yes I am a Long time Follett reader, my first taste of his work is still my favorite \\"Eye of the needle\\". But I will say first about this book, and I have heard it from several readers I told about the book, I did not want to put it down once I started it. Hammer of Eden takes Place in modern day California, which is something surprising about Follett, whose works mostly take Place in the Past before my birth. I was grabbed almost form the first Page, I was pulling for the good guys, I was pulling for the bad guy (you will too, though he still stays repellent as well) My heart went out to every single Character as they each faced Trials due to their actions. Can't say I was not a bit saddened at the end, but it was a satisfying ending all the same. read this Book, you will not be sorry. I wasn't, I was entertained. Thank you Mr. Follett!

0316066524|5.0|Honestly, what is there to be said about this that hasn't been said about twenty times in other reviews?  Yes, it's immaculately structured and complex and does things other books don't.  Yes, despite that it still has an entirely human center with deep and real characters.  I guess my input on this would be to say that the novel, despite what everything I've read up about it seems to imply, is not something to look at in awe but rather something to connect to.  Also worth mentioning, get the paperback edition.  It corrects some typos and mistakes still present in the hardcover (despite having some odd formatting errors of its own).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|well this game is great for all ages and haves lots of action I think all kids should get this games and enjoy it :)

B0086700CM|1.0|This game used to be a fun time killer. It had a bit of lag with regards to the swiping, which is detrimental to this type of game, but the latest update made it much worse. Now, my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket running 4.0.3 won't recognize the swipes about 70% of the time and the other 30% the character runs straight through tree stumps and off cliffs. What little gameplay there was is now ruined by update 1.0.6.
B007V508CC|3.0|With Adam Levine and Company at the height of their popularity, naming the new album OVEREXPOSED sends mixed signals. The band realizes that here, at the peak of their fame, they are at their most poppy. Do they regret it? Do they embrace it? Coming off of the heels of the massive hit \\"Moves Like Jagger,\\" Levine has said that the song revitalized the band's career; it gave them a direction. Now, the band plans to capitalize on that direction with their newest release. This new creative direction has turned out to be pretty polarizing with fans of the band.<br /><br />The band that wrote SONGS ABOUT JANE is barely recognizable here. The light indie-rock that brought the band into the public eye is gone, replaced with a slick, uptempo version of modern disco. Levine would even state of the album: \\"It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune.\\" Not that it is necessarily a bad thing; the production and writing here is so slick and streamlined that all of these songs sound like they could appear on the radio. The band doesn't feel out of place -- it's a sound that works for them. There's a ton of influences here: reggae, blues, funk, indie rock, pop, etc... but it's all been covered with a glossy sheen of production. The biggest issue with this production is that most of the songs sound very similar; and if you aren't thrilled with their new sound, this album will really wear out its welcome. The OVEREXPOSED opens with \\"One More Night\\" (upcoming single), a solid song that sets the tone and mood of the album. Second track, \\"Payphone,\\" has already received a ton of radioplay, and deservedly so: it's a fun, catchy hit. Luckily, the rap interlude by Wiz Khalifa isn't a recurring theme. \\"Ladykiller\\" is a funky, disco-tinged song that is as catchy as it is littered with falsetto. OVEREXPOSED feels like the band is having a good time trying out this more mainstream direction, pouring their influences into more conventional formats. Unfortunately, the album doesn't quite hit the heights of its first half.<br /><br />Fans who were hoping for a continuation of the direction seen in HANDS ALL OVER are in luck. However, if you were hoping for a return to the funk-tinged IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG or the personal SONGS ABOUT JANE, chances are you will probably be disappointed with this new record. If you enjoyed last year's massive hit \\"Moves Like Jagger,\\" check this album out. Highlight tracks to sample/download: \\"Payphone,\\" \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Ladykiller,\\" and \\"Beautiful Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />Additional Release Info: The deluxe edition of OVEREXPOSED comes with three extra songs, including the excellent cover of Prince's \\"Kiss.\\" The other two songs are good, but I would only recommend for Maroon 5 fans interested in their new direction.heights of its first half.<br /><br />Fans who were hoping for a continuation of the direction seen in HANDS ALL OVER are in luck.

B007Y6OZE0|4.0|With RISE AND FALL, RAGE AND GRACE, the Offspring attempted to harken back to their musical roots.  By trying to abandon their alternative-rock trappings (CONSPIRACY OF ONE, SPLINTER) for a more punk-rock focus, fans received mixed results.  Unfortunately, DAYS GO BY is another release with mixed results.  The good news: it contains some of the best punk-rock that the band has released in over a decade.  The bad news: the bad songs here are stupendously bad.<br /><br />The Good:<br />There's an immediacy present here that's been missing from the past several Offspring albums (probably since SMASH).  Perhaps it's the songs like \\"Secrets From The Underground\\" or \\"Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides the Bomb to Hell,\\" with lyrics that deal with the current state of culture in America.  Perhaps it's the opening guitar riffs of \\"The Future Is Now\\" that hit the ground running.  Whatever the reason, this sounds like an earnest, honest album, with the exception of a handful of tracks.  The first two tracks, (\\"The Future Is Now,\\" \\"Secrets From The Underground,\\") wouldn't sound out of place on SMASH or IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE.  Lead single and title track \\"Days Gone By,\\" is less angry or energetic but a bit more introspective.<br /><br />With 2012 being the 20th anniversary of IGNITION, the band decided to rerecord fan favorite \\"Dirty Magic.\\"  It seems strange that the band would cover one of their own songs; luckily, the song is given justice thanks to updates sound/mastering equipment.  \\"Divide By Zero\\" harkens back to the band's earlier material once again.  Clocking in at a little over 2 minutes, it's fast, and packed with melody. The final track, \\"Slim Pickens...\\", provides a grim outlook on pop culture.  Influenced by the pilot of Kubrik's DR. STRANGELOVE, the Offspring are pleading for it all to burn.  Rather than try to fix the creatively and morally bankrupt culture, the band asks to throw it all away to start over instead.  Lyrically, it sums up the album nicely.  Musically, it bookends DAYS GO BY with the same immediacy that began in \\"The Future Is Now.\\"  It feels like the band has been reinvigorated and reenergized.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />DAYS GO BY shows no signs of slowing down until its midpoint: \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\" is an abomination.  Much like \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\\" was a lampoon of the times' lame mainstream rock, \\"Cruising California\\" attempts to parody current pop hits.  Unfortunately, the result is a song that is ultimately not clever or witty; instead, it succumbs to the vapidity that it tries to make fun of.  At only 3 and a half minutes long, it feels like an eternity.  Two songs later, the ranchero-influenced \\"OC Guns\\" rears its ugly head.  Marked with chessy turntables, trumpets, and braindead lyrics, it further damages the album's consistency.  Again, two tracks later, \\"I Wanna Secret Family (With You)\\" showcases the same alternative-rock that influenced SPLINTER.  This song, marked with plenty of \\"do-do-do's\\", feels like the band trying to write another radio-hit.  These songs marr an otherwise solid album; DAYS GO BY is an album that is at its worst when the band tries to fit into mainstream music.<br /><br />Overall:<br />This album should please both longtime fans of the Offspring and new fans alike.  DAYS GO BY may be a bit frustrating because its early tracks show such great promise, but the album tries to be too many things.  It tries to be an earnest homage to the bands' back catalog and make fun of modern society.  The former works best; the best songs on here are played with a straight face rather than tongue-in-cheek.  Compared to RISE AND FALL, the best songs here are stronger than those on their previous album, but the worst songs here are worse than those on their previous album.  Standout songs to sample: \\"The Future Is Now,\\" \\"Secrets From the Underground,\\" and \\"Days Go By.\\"  These songs (the first three on the album) offer some of the best of the collection..
1594203334|5.0|Reading Pamela Druckerman's Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting [[ASIN:1594203334 Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting]] immediately brought to mind 2011's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua [[ASIN:1594202842 Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]].<br /><br />I think there are two factors at work here. As a society, Americans have become so politically-correct that we treat everyone else like burn victims. This same attitude extends itself to our kids.<br /><br />There are way too many people in the world and the P-C attitude with which we treat others makes us feel separate from them and therefore afraid of them, too. It's not that there's more child abuse or rape-murders: these were always with us. But today we think Halloween apples are loaded with needles and razorblades and confections might be dosed with cannabis.<br /><br />In addition to teaching our kids responsibility, we need to teach them discrimination. That's the true path to a fulfilling adulthood.<br /><br />It's high time we avoided passing off our childcare to teachers at mercilessly expensive elite schools and learned to enjoy our time with them, as fellow human travelers.<br /><br />The best we can hope for is to raise children who, as adults, we'd choose as friends...even though we didn't have to!<br /><br />We've discovered that it's not too much to expect civility of our children. They are not somehow exempt from the rules we apply to others.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This app is a fairly typical hidden-object game.  There isn't really much too distinguish it from the 90 or so other HO-type games currently available on Amazon.  It has a good story line, and the graphics are good enough, though occasionally a bit blurry on my Xoom tablet.<br /><br />It's a bit confusing when your character keeps saying she needs to find one particular item, like a doll or a watch, but then you start searching for a dozen things that aren't that one item.<br /><br />I would have given this game 5 stars, but I'm docking one because it keeps bugging me to log into Facebook or rate the app.
B007V508CC|4.0|I'm not going to give a long tedious review of each song in depth on the album. However this album is a great listen. Fans that liked the more disco soulful pop sound of 'Hands All Over' will be in for a great experience. From frontman Adam Levine's comments on this record we can see that the band followed in the experience and response from the ultra smash hit \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and decided to give this record a more disco pop record with influences of raggae and soulful rock along the way. I would have to say this record is an improvement of the band's other reflection of their new direction, \\"Hands All Over\\". This record incorporates the disco pop that people loved from \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and coups it with a more soulful indie raggae rock vibe that makes more of the tracks listen-able and noteworthy.<br /><br />The record starts with the song (and newest single) \\"One More Night\\" containing a strong raggae pop vibe to start this record off. This song gives fans a strong taste of Maroon 5's new soulful pop sound. Following it is \\"Payphone\\" , the lead single and thoughtfully filled song that has become catchy among people everywhere. Its catchy and quietly soothing melodies are right on and one of the best tracks on the album. \\"Daylight\\" another favorite among fans so far is a quiet mid temp guitar song that speaks soothingly and could give fans a taste of \\"Songs About Jane\\" and it is one that could be seen as being released as a single soon.<br /><br />One thing that a lot of old and new Maroon 5 fans might not get is that band's are all about taking off from great happenings and expanding their direction. Many might critize this record because of it's more disco pop sound and would rather prefer the soulful indie rock/pop of \\"Songs about Jane\\". However these people need to realize that its hard to match the first record of a band. The first record is the one that they have spent their whole lives writing, its the one where they were figuring things out and trying new things. So why don't those people hung up on \\"Songs About Jane\\" try to listen in on this record and the comments the band makes about the writing of it to see Maroon 5's new direction.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For the Deluxe Edition there are 3 bonus tracks. As an unbaised listener, I would recommend just sticking to the standard edition. \\"Wipe Your Eyes\\" is a slightly good tune, but it falls short of the rest of the record and comes off as kind of bland. The only noteworthy part of the deluxe edition is the cover of \\"Kiss\\" that provides a greatly awesome different take off of Prince's version.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed was dealing with grief and a loss of direction in her life. She could not move forward because she was stuck in the muck of the past. Her mother had died of cancer, her family had scattered and her marriage was broken. One day she noticed a booklet about Pacific Crest Trail in a store where she was shopping. She later went back and bought the booklet and started planning a trip that would change her life forever.<br /><br />This book is a true story about Cheryl Strayed's solitary hike from California to Washington state. She did not have any hiking experience but her spirit was compelling her to do this. She learned that she was stronger and more courageous than she ever imagined. She completed the 1100 mile hike and escaped the demons that had haunted her in the past.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed shared the physical and spiritual journey that she experienced when she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995. I had never heard of this trail and knew very little about hiking and camping when I started this book.<br /><br /> felt like I was hiking right along with Cheryl as she faced heat, cold, hunger, pain and many other challenges on the trail. She expressed the feelings that we all feel when we doubt ourselves and our capabilities. She was not defeated by the hardships that she faced during her journey. She proved to herself that she had what it takes to survive and thrive in a world that sometimes seems hostile and dangerous. She did not give up when she found herself in seemingly hopeless situations.<br /><br />Cheryl had been running from herself and her feelings for her entire life. This journey gave her time to be alone and realize that her life was just as it should be and that she could accept herself just the way she was.<br /><br />This book will challenge you to try things that are difficult. It will inspire you to do the impossible. The questions and comments in the Oprah's Book Club edition of this book are excellent. This is the kind of book that you will want to share with your friends and family members. Highly Recommended!that you will want to share with your friends and family members. Highly Recommended!
B007VLHP9K|5.0|Sony reissue on DVD recordings well known to fans of the Romanian director. We are in the early 90s and can no longer say Celibidache face just plain music: his performances are steeped in philosophy (Husserl's phenomenology), mysticism and physical acoustics. You can love him or hate him, but not avoid knowing.<br />Personally I prefer his Bruckner from the 60s and 70s (much more \\"human\\") rather than the 90s that seems to speak of the universe and the laws which provide for galaxy's revolution. But it is impossible not to be amazed by the extreme coherence of Celibidache's musical thought and his ability in rehearsing the different plans sound of the orchestra. The video also allows you to appreciate the rarity and the linearity of the last Celibidache conducting gesture now forced to stay sit by the difficult of walking (very different,indeed, from the most fiery and evocative showed in his youth) and to recognize the funny director's mumbling during the performance.<br />Rather more difficult to come to terms with the bonus audio Romantic recorded in 1989 in Vienna on tour. Without the support of the video's 80 minutes are running out of the reach of a home listening. For the last Celibidache I am convinced it was fundamental to participate in the \\"ritual\\" collective interpretation in order to appreciate the full implications already mentioned (philosophical, mystical and acoustic).<br /><br />Sony ristampa in DVD materiale ben noto agli appassionati del direttore rumeno. Siamo agli inizi degli anni '90 e Celibidache non si può più dire faccia semplicemnte musica: le sue interpretazioni sono permeate di filosofia (la fenomenologia husserliana), misticismo e fisica acustica. Potete amarlo od odiarlo, ma non evitare di conoscerlo.<br />Personalmente preferisco il suo Bruckner anni '60 e '70 (molto più \\"umano\\") piuttosto che questo anni '90 che sembra parlare dell'Universo e delle leggi che che ne sanciscono la rivoluzione. Ma è impossibile non restare sbalorditi dalla estrema coerenza del pensiero musicale di Celibidache e dalla sua capacità di concertazione dei piani sonori dell'orchestra. Il video permette inoltre di apprezzare la rarefazione e la linearità del gesto direttoriale dell'ultimo Celibidache ormai costretto a dirigere seduto per problemi di deambulazione (molto diverso da quello giovanile più fiammeggiante ed evocativo)e di riconoscere gli interventi \\"sonori\\" dello stesso direttore nel corso dell'esecuzione.<br />Più difficile invece venire a patti con il bonus audio della Romantica registrata nel 1989 a Vienna in tournée. Senza il supporto del video gli oltre 80 minuti d'esecuzione sono fuori dalla portata di un ascolto casalingo. Per l'ultimo Celibidache sono convinto fosse fondamentale la partecipazione al \\"rito\\" collettivo dell'interpretazione per poterne apprezzare tutte le implicazioni già citate (filosofiche, mistiche e acustiche).
0786888628|3.0|In some ways \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is brilliant and in others it severely falls short since the author could not objectively portray the political realm of the war.<br /><br />Brilliant:<br />Halberstam seamlessly moves between macro and micro levels of the conflict, drawing the reader in with excellent detail and narrative. He addresses everything from the geopolitical and Army and Corps level all the way down to the Company, Platoon, and individual level, moving back and forth between them masterfully. There are numerous, very well illustrated maps with troop movements on both sides (my most common complaint with military history books). The use of standard military symbols on the maps is a huge plus, allowing very clear and easy understanding of who was where and illustrating the general movement of the battle. All in all, a very engaging and enjoyable read, with some severe flaws...<br /><br />Flaws:<br />As has been stated by other reviewers, Halborstam, like Barbara Tuchman in \\"March of Folly,\\" is unable to move beyond personal bias to give an objective account of the geopolitical situation. Regardless of your political affiliation, it is always easy to criticize political and military actions through the lens of history while ignoring the zeitgeist of the time that espoused those erroneous ideas.<br /><br />Case in point: Both Tuchman and Halborstam criticize politicians for viewing communism as monolithic, all the while ignoring Stalin's imposing persona coupled with the very real civil war in Greece, the danger to Turkey, nuclear bomb development, the Berlin crisis, the Iron Curtain, etc... Yes, history has shown that nationalism is stronger than ties to one monolithic communist organization run by the Soviets (e.g. Mao's China and Ho Chi Min's efforts in Vietnam). However, when surrounded by world events on several fronts of a growing appearance of a communist threat, it is very easy to see why politicians were so easily led to believe in monolithic communism driven by Stalin.<br /><br />Yes, MacArthur was a narcissist and definitely rash and in many ways closed-minded. I believe history has exonerated Truman. However, Republican support for Chiang, however misguided, makes sense when considered with all of the other problems with communism world-wide at the time. It is easy to see now that the U.S. should have extended the olive branch to Mao and Ho Chi Min when their nationalist movements were gaining traction, but the zeitgeist of the late 1940's prevented it. With that said, I agree that McCarthy was a stain on the liberties the Constitution guarantees, but I can sympathize with the fears, whether founded or not.<br /><br />The coup de gras for Halberstam's blunders was his ridiculous and childish dig at George W. Bush. History may or may not exonerate Bush for his decisions in office, but it is absolutely untenable to take a swipe at Bush in a book about the history of the Korean war. That dig alone was enough for me to drop the book down an entire star.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I still enjoyed the book very much. The strength of Halberstam's prose and narrative and his masterful use of detail at both the macro and micro level is fantastic. However, it should be understood that Halborstam definitely has very strong sympathies with the Democrats of the time and is very dismissive of Republican fears and motives regarding communism. As I said, I believe history has exonerated Truman and shown that he was a shrewd, smart, and considerate president. Unfortunately, Halborstam's bias drags down an otherwise brilliant book.

B000XUBC5E|5.0|I read many of the reviews before I decided to buy this book and I wasn't disappointed.  Maybe it is because this was my first (certainly not my last) Coben book that I thought it was great!  I found the story the characters the mystery and action intriguing and entertaining I guess you can say it was all encompassing.  In the past I often found myself walking down the same aisle in the store going to the same alphabetical section and choosing a safe and predictable author but since I have purchased my Kindle I am branching out into new authors.  I don't randomly pick a book, I pay heed to the many reviews on that book before I buy and so far I have not been disappointed.  Coben is well researched with his ideas and knows not to push too hard with them or drag them on.  I thoroughly enjoyed the supporting cast of misfit characters and their stories too.  I particularty like that the unquestionable faith of his brother's innocence carried throughtout this book added (spoiler alert) yet another surprising twist at the end. (I never like to give too much away because as a reader I prefer that the story carry me away and not a 'telling' review) so I will end with I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this book and hope you do too!

In addition, this book is only 50 pages, which is not much for the price.  Conversely, my daughter, who is 35, loved the book, felt the instructions were well written and the book was well laid out, so I upped my review from 3 stars to 4.  She liked the idea that the art was based on improving your brain activity and not just art for art's sake, and overall, thought it was very cool.

It was so boring that I had to pause the movie several times just to \\"take a break.\\" When I finally got through most of it, I was disappointed to find little if any action in the ending. I give it 2 stars because I thought the acting was good. Other than that, I don't see how this movie is a 5 stars.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Fiona's new album is the same moody mess that listeners have come to love.  While this album is a little more depressing than her previous album, it is still well received.  Once again, Fiona takes us deeper into her troubled psyche and her strung out heavy lyrics matched with her deep timbre force you to close your eyes and rock back and forth....in moody moritund joy, of course.  Never losing a chance to make a statement, each song reveals an aspect of the more troubled side of solitary humanity that most of us shy away from.  The lead single \\"Every Single Night\\" is a glorious chant for the restlessness that undoubtedly keeps most of us awake at night, and the track \\"Left Alone\\" tells the story of a heart longing for love, but being \\"too hard to know.\\"  The album ends with \\"Hot Knife\\" a hip incessant melody claiming a heated love ready to cut into a new lover.  Fiona picks up where she left off; every album a new revelation.

030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a creepy, twisted, engaging thriller about marriage and relationships.  Set in these modern day times where we all struggle to deal with the depressing economy and the modern techonology that continues to crush once secure career choices.  Meet Nick and Amy Dunne who take turns telling the reader their story - but don't be too sure about which character will you side with, or even relate to.  Author Gillian Flynn has created a masterful psychological suspense story that explores a marriage that has gone oh so very wrong.  Readers who tend to pretend their marriages are perfect and all that likely won't enjoy reading this story.  I'm about as happy as you can be in a marriage, but many bits of this story struck me as so true (individually don't we all compromise who we really are, or what we really want, from time to time for the sake of our marriage?).  This is a good story - Alfred Hitchcock like.  I highly recommend it!
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I know a lot of people don't like him, I just don't see why. He has so much talent he could basically do anything, and be great at it. I believe that he is going to last forever. In my opinion he's one of the few greats. He has worked so hard to get where he is. I like the sound on the album, it's meant for everyone. This album is very addicting, I'm already singing along. He worked with amazing artists on the album. Have an open mind listen to the music before you judge. He was meant to do music. This is one of my favorite albums of the year.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I'm a Los Angeles based professional photographer working in entertainment related commercial photography.  After disappointing results from the pantone huey pro I was debating between ColorMunki and Spyder express which are in similar price categories. The Spyder only allows you to profile one device per user license. With the ColorMunki I've profiled all the computers in my home and it works amazingly well. It takes control of most monitors brightness and contrast settings within the software so to know you're getting a very accurate profile. On devices like my flat screen TV it's on screen guide prompted me to raise and lower the contrast and brightness with the TV's remote which was super cool and produced incredible results. An added bonus is that it can also profile DLP or LCD Projectors. For the price I'm thrilled with the ColorMunki Display.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Something for everyone.  I like it better on kindle than I do on my android device.  The bigger screen makes the games easier.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|BEEN PLAYING AND SO FAR SO GOOD.GREAT STORY LINE AND LOVE THE GRAPHICS! WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE FIRE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS HAVING TO DO A FACEBOOK SIGN UP. I JUST IGNORE IT WHEN IT APPEARS ON SCREEN.I DO LIKE THE FUN GAME. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THST LIKES HIDDEN PUZZLES.
B003Y5H542|3.0|While the movie itself was well done (that's why it got 3 stars)  The story behind the movie just didn't agree with me. I remember seeing the previews for this movie in theaters and being interested but, after watching the movie, I was very disappointed. The previews gave everything away and well the story fell flat after that.
B0009XRZ9M|3.0|The DVD works just fine.  The case was not in the best shape.  My son just loves this movie and it was a good price.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading the first chapter, I knew that this book was not for me. Unfortunately, I kept reading in the hopes that it would somehow get better. It didn't. Most of the book was incredibly boring and not at all believable. I could kick myself for wasting my precious free time reading such poorly written CRAP. I will not repeat the same mistake on the remaining two books in the trilogy.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I bought this after I played a freebie of the day game from Alawar. Their hidden object games are so fun &amp; addictive. Much better than your usual hidden object game as you have to piece together the items. Great, colorful graphics. I'm on my way to download Snark 2. :)
0385523912|3.0|When I began reading this book I was fairly interested, however about 80 pages into the 300 page book, I'd lost interest.<br /><br />The stories are interesting, but I think my biggest flaw with this book was the authors input. It seems as if the author tried to make these stories read like a story, that the added details like \\"Mi-ran crossed her legs as she looked at her food, eyes wide with confusion, face marked with disgust\\" made very uncomfortable. These added details made me wonder how much of the information was from the interviewees, and how much was from the author's imagination. I often times wondered \\"how could the author know how Mi-ran crossed her legs, and how her eyes looked, and how her face was contorted if she wasn't actually there?\\"<br /><br />In addition to that, I find that this book would have been better if all of the stories were  placed into their own section. I understand the author was trying to show different people lived their lives when subjected to the same situation, but personally I found this style a little distracting because right when I was getting into Mi-ran and Jun-Sang's story, it would cut off to Mrs. Song's story.<br /><br />This is only my personal preference, so this review is really just my personal opinion. Other's may find the writing style and set up to their book enjoyable, but I personally did not. I did finish the book and did enjoy the stories, just not the way he book was set up.
