B000099T2L|4.0|I could not wait to get my hands on this CD and it was worth the wait!  So much so that I'm compelled to write a review--a first for me.  Beyonce has an incredible voice and this CD showcases her vocal range.  By the way, you can't get the full effect by listening to snippets!<br />1. Crazy in Love - catchy song that makes you want to do the booty shake!  Kinda reminds me of Washington, D.C. go-go music.<br />2. Naughty Girl - love it!  It has a Middle Eastern vibe, with a slight feel of 70's \\"Shaft\\" and 80's Michael Jackson. This should be her next single.<br />3. Baby Boy - good reggae beat. I love the off-beat clap. This one is growing on me.<br />4. Hip Hop Star - this one's O.K. It sounds like an Outkast song (bass music with guitars).  Pop star or hip hop star...hmm<br />5. Be With You - this is one of my favorites.  It's mid-tempo with a thumping beat (think Amerie's \\"Talkin' to Me\\").  The chorus is crazy!<br />6. Me, Myself And I - a bit of a slower jam. Nothing stand out to me.<br />7. Yes - I'm not sure I'm feeling the chorus, but it has good \\"let's wait\\" message--however contradictory to the other sexy songs.<br />8. Signs - alright, this song is a little ridiculous.  Don't know your astrological signs?  You will after a couple listens! The chorus gets stuck in your head.<BR> <BR>9. Speechless - this song is awesome! It's romantic and sexy, reminiscent of Aaliyah (R.I.P.).  I'm loving all 6 minutes! Beyonce really nails those high notes at the end.<br />10.That's How You Like It - I don't really like this song.  I'm surprised that Jay-Z is on something like this.<br />11.The Closer I Get To You - duet with Luther Vandross.  What can I say, they sound great together.  Younger fans may not appreciate this classic song.<br />12.Dangerously in Love 2 - this could have been left off. It's the same as the DC version, just with slightly different music. I actually prefer the first version to this one. <br />13.Beyonce Interlude - a little poetry, I guess. At least it's not a dumb skit (a la Ashanti)<br />14.Gift from Virgo -  despite the title, the song is NOT about Virgos. It's actually a jazz song.  She's trys out her Jill Scott a little on this one.<br />15.Daddy - the only bonus track on my CD.  This song is so heartfelt and personal.  It's the ultimate compliment to the man she wants her \\"unborn son and husband\\" to be like.
0385504209|3.0|If you've read any non-fiction books dealing with the Grail and the Priory already... Well...<br />  When I first saw this book in the store, I grabbed it (thinking it was non-fiction), read the inside flaps of the dust jacket and put it back.  I didn't think too much of the book until I heard more praise for it, then I purchased a copy.<br />  I will agree with most of the other reviewers and say this: it was definately a quick read, not a bad book at all. BUT, as a big fan of the 'alternate history' genre (or whatever they call it these days) I had already done all, and much more, of the reading behind this book.  Basically nothing new in there (if you've read books like: Holy Blood, Holy Grail; The Templar Revelation, etc...)  But I do like the fact that someone has finally written a good novel dealing with the information that's been out there for a while but relegated to the 'fringe'.<br />  So actually, I would give this book a 4 and a half star rating if I had been completely unfamiliar with the subjects covered.  I was also pleased to see a listing of several books 'for further reading' given at the outset of one of the chapters.  A worthwhile experience either way.
B000096I9G|5.0|BUY IT NOW!<br />If you have not experienced The Cure live now is a chance to get a feel for how incredible they are live.  After my first Cure concert I was blown away, this DVD recreates that experience.  If you do not own a top notch stero system and an HDTV now you have a reason to get them.  The two encores are reason enough to pick this up.  The first power cords of the Kiss sends chills down your spine.  <br />BTW to those that complain that it doesn't sound like the CD's, I say GREAT!  That is why I love their live stuff so much.  Rob will go off on tagents taking the songs in different directions but always adding something to them.<br />Don't die without seeing and hearing this DVD.

When I gained friends in high school, friends that are now distant memories to me sad to say...I understood It even more.  I understood the good and the bad of being a child.

0800103661|5.0|Gattaca is a fascinating science fiction/mystery movie, set in the 'not too distant future', in which astronauts dress in stylish, roaring-twenties inspired clothing and where the world seems to be finely ordered and sequenced, just like a genetic code.<br />In fact, it is the genetic code which determines all. Test-tube babies are the norm for anyone who wants to have a chance; screening out imperfections has become routine, and those who have the misfortune of being born outside the system of genetic checks and balances will find themselves invalid (in-valid in the sense of not valid for work, as well as invalid in the sense of incapacitated for advancement). Society has been structured around a pre-defined sense of potential as projected by genetic codes. But there are a few who challenge the system.<br />Meet Vincent, a.k.a. Jerome Morrow (played by Ethan Hawke), who dreams of the stars and lusts for a position at Gattaca (the new-age NASA), but with the genetic code of a loser. Enter Jerome Morrow, a.k.a. Eugene (played by Jude Law), who has the potential, but also a broken spinal cord -- he lends Vincent, through an ingenious and intricate system, his genetic sequence. In this guise, Vincent thus rises to the position of navigator, selected for the great Titan/Saturn mission.<br />Then, the director gets murdered. A flake of skin falls from Vincent which the investigators find, and the chase is on. The launch is a week away. Will Vincent outrun the pursuers in time?<br />Of course, Vincent's pursuers are led by his brother, the genetically-planned offspring of the family, who thought that Vincent was dead. There is an ultimate contest, which Vincent wins, proving the victory of determination over pre-determination.<br />Vincent, in the person of Jerome, falls in love with Irene (played by Uma Thurman), who works at Gattaca in a sort of genetic quality-control position. She falls in love the potential, the idea of Jerome, but eventually comes to love the imperfect Vincent. She herself, for all the genetic planning, also has an imperfection, which makes her all the more attractive to Vincent.<br />Gore Vidal has a small but crucial role as a flight director in charge of keeping things on track (with style!) as the murder investigation threatens the operations at Gattaca.<br />This movie is a visually interesting, unique, and much under-rated and under appreciated show. It won awards for art direction and other stylistic touches, including the Oscar.<br />I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that Vincent and Jerome both leave the earth.<br />'For someone never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say that every atom of our body was once part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving. Maybe I'm going home.'<br />Interestingly, the idea of genetics is woven into the movie in very many ways, some subtle, some explicit. The very title, Gattaca, consists of the strands of bases that comprise the double helix of DNA G (guanine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine) -- the sequence of these bases constitutes genetic information, much as the arrangement of the 26 letters of this alphabet constitutes information.<br />This is a clever film, a bit slow, but stylish, suspenseful, wonderfully visual, and well worth a weekend evening investment.ect Vincent.

B000002UJQ|5.0|The sheer brilliance of this record will haunt the listener for years afterwards. Simply put, this IS one of the greatest albums of all time. If you have yet to hear it, go into this one with no preconcieved notions...From start to finish, OK COMPUTER captures all aspects of how beautiful rock n roll can be.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Well, people have nearly said it all about this new DVD edition.  But I just wanted to add a few things:  The version in this Extreme DVD, is the \\"Special Extended edition\\". Despite what it says on the menu, it is not the plain special edition. It actually includes all the possible deleted escenes they ever took out (t-1000 scanning john's room and the alternative ending are accesible via watching the movie on \\"interactive mode\\").  And some people are saying that the only way to see the theatrical version is by playing the disc on your computer's DVD-ROM, on windows media 9 series. Well, that is not true. You can watch the theatrical version on your normal DVD player. Just highlight (red) \\"sensory control\\", then on your remote control press the \\"right\\" button 5 times. To the right, the phrase \\"The future is not set\\" will appear. Then press \\"enter\\" on your remote control, and the \\"play special edition\\" will morph into \\"theatrical version\\". There you have it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|What in the hell is keeping you from getting this album?  After about 10 solid listens, I can undoubtedly tell you that this is going to be a timeless album that many will appreciate for a long time.  Rarely do bands reach complete perfection on one album like The Mars Volta has with 'De-Loused in the Comatorium.'  <br />When you think of rock-n-roll over it's history, some of the most celebrated bands you may think of are Led Zeppelin, Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd and maybe only a few others.  Take all the aforementioned bands, extract the most prized elements of each of them, and you pretty much have a good idea of what 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' sounds like.  It'd also be easy to say that other than Blood Sugar Sex Magic, this is Rick Rubin's finest hour.  At the Drive-In is/was a phenomenal band, but this is off the hook.<br />I'd review each song for you, but it would really be pointless for me to waste your time.  Once you've heard 'De-Loused' for yourself, you'll be amazed at how it never ceases in its persistance for greatness.  Your children will be listening to this album in twenty years, and so will you.<br />Finally, much respect should be given to Flea for his performance.  His touch is always a beautiful thing.
B000099T2L|3.0|Destiny's Child frontwoman Beyonce Knowles finally releases her highly anticipated solo debut. While many people have considered her to be solo since the get-go, this time Knowles really does do it all on her own and she proves that with some a little work and a little more mature material, she can be one of the leading divas in the next generation of music.<br />The album's lead single \\"Crazy in Love\\" (Featuring fiancee` Jay-Z), is hypnotic. This fantastic song is laced with an infectious beat, a catchy hook & terrific vocals. Elsewhere on the album Knowles showcases her sexier side, such as on songs like \\"Hip Hop Star\\" where she sensually intructs the track's guest stars Big Boi of Outkast & Sleepy Brown to undress her in  silky smooth and breathy vocals.<br />However, its the ballads of the album that are the true stand out. The title track \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a while, \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" with Luther Vandross is a fantastic duet, but the highlight is easily the sexy, jazz influenced \\"Speechless\\". Other stand outs include Knowles attempt at neo-soul, \\"A Gift from Virgo\\", and the all to true \\"Yes\\".<br />This album shows that Beyonce has the potential to follow in the footsteps of the divas before her, such as Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige & others. All she has to do is remove the immature & corny material, such as \\"Signs\\" (Featuring Missy 'Misdemenor' Elliott) & \\"Naughty Girl\\" that are geared tward fans of Destiny's Child's Disney Channel ready albums.
0380977788|5.0|I had the good fortune of reading this book aloud to my daughter.  It struck a dark chord which enthralled us and the further I aread, the more I loved its dark, mirky tone.  It had the plus of  bringing to light that what you think that you want is not so great and by the time the book was over, the main character, and my daughter, both learn to realize that they should love their parents the way they are, if only slightly imperfect.  A wonderfully dark tale with a rewarding moral.  <br />As a bonus, it is unimaginable that this book could be a movie, emphasizing the long known reality that books are better than movies and worth the effort.
B00009V7RF|5.0|The Black Eyed Peas have really hit one out of the Park with their latest offering. It doesn't get much better than this folks. Honestly, the Beatles were pretty good back in their day, but even they would admit that they never had a song this good. I can't get enough of Where is the Love! This Song shows you that you can send a good message and still have a great song, maybe even the best song of all time! The message of this song is the stuff dreams are made of, and it still makes you want to get down and get jiggy with it!
6305161879|5.0|This DVD is a must-have if you're a Monty Python fan.  I loved this move when it came out at the cinema years ago.  This movie is clever and hilarious.  John Cleese is at his best, as is Kevin Kline.  I've never gotten tired of this movie, and it never fails to get me laughing out-loud.  Wish more were like this one, and I'm glad it's on a DVD.
0783117523|3.0|I was immediately impressed with Angelina Jolie's natural acting in this role. She has a powerful force in this movie, you believe she could have Gia's feelings. Though, Gia's mother in real life was livid when she saw this movie. I have visited her websites, specifically \\"Simply Gia\\", which is a well-known and respected site for any Gia fan. That aside, the DVD does not offer any artifacts, photos, or interviews of the real Gia herself. That is something they would have benefitted from for a movie about Gia's life. The cast and director are superb as a whole and the DVD offers a photo gallery of Angelina Jolie as Gia as a \\"bonus\\". <BR>I would reccommend this movie because it has a definiate biographical quality that Gia herself did not live to tell.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be like The Matrix. Only two things resembled The Matrix, one was a shoot out scene and the other is they wore coats that resembled Keanu Reeves' coat. Other than that, it's not living in a computer world or anything like that type movie. I kept expecting someone to wake up only to realize their entire life was a dream. Finally I figured out it wasn't meant to be a computer/dream type movie. Once I realized that, I was able to enjoy the movie even better.<BR>This movie is amazing. I love the fight scenes and the flow the movie is near perfect. It is very well directed and the acting is top-notch! I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie...well one thing, a couple of the fight scenes could have been a bit longer. But even the short fighting scenes are still very effective. <BR>A+ kudos for an excellent movie, which will never leave my DVD collection, I recommend it to any Sci-Fi and/or Thriller fans.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I cannot help but feel sadness when remembering this movie.  Not because it was a bad movie, but because it was so good in that I cared about the characters.  Isn't that how you know when a movie or a story is great?  When one starts to forget what room they are in and starts thinking about what they would do in such and such a situation, or they find themselves praying for the characters (only very quickly smacking themself in the mind to \\"snap out of it\\"), then one knows she has a movie worth the cost.  The Gladiator is a movie about duty and honor, but it is tragic as the main character never really...well, you will have to see the movie for that (if you haven't) and if you have, then your getting angry or filling in the blank where I left off has made my point.  You could not stop.  You knew it by heart.  You knew the Gladiator.  You others can know it too.  Only remember this:  it was not being a Gladiator that made him great; it was his character.  And that point is all the more why I recommend heartily with five stars - Gladiator.<br />Just get it and see!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The quest continues to destroy Sauron's ring in this remarkable sequel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The Two Towers manages to retain the same amount of characterization, story development, and theatrical style that made the first film so powerful and amazing.<br />The film's characters are still remarkably well-developed.  Their relationships flourish and grow more complicated, as Frodo becomes more corrupt and Gollum reveals a split personality (which is shown extremely well in the film!).  There's also more humor among the existing characters.<br />Surprisingly, supporting characters rarely seen in the original book are also further developed (Arwen, Elrond, and Celeborn make a reappearance).  And new characters also recieve a fair amount of development.  The only bad thing about the characters is that Saruman doesn't make much of an appearance.<br />The film retains the same visual style as the last film.  There's more large-scale shots, particuarly as the armies of Mordor are seen marching across the land.  It's breathtaking to see thousands and thousands of orcs marching across the screen; there's no other film like it.  The battle of Helm's Deep is equally remarkable and is the highlight of the whole film.  Also noteworthy are the ents, who ultimately sack Isengard.  Even the ruined city where the Nazgul rule was done well.  Among all these great scenes, there's still some artistic elements as well that embellish the story's ideas.<br />There are certain elements that the film has incorporated that were not present in the original story, such as the elves' involvement in Helm's Deep, or Aragorn's battle with the orc wolf-riders.  These added elements may take away from the accuracy of the movie, but are still enjoyable to watch.<br />This movie serves as a fine chapter in the whole trilogy.  It's just as good as the last film and is very much worthy of watching.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Okay, reviewing this album was a bit hard for me. Mainly because I am simply a devoted fan of tATu yet, I don't want to just include the positive aspects of the album for it would be unfair to the readers who want a balanced review of postive and negative aspects. No, this review isn't about the gimmicks it's about the music itself. So, let's just forget about the gimmick today shall we?<br />With everything there is always a good and bad, and tATu's album is no exception. Technically speaking, tATu's debut album is your run of the mill teenage pop album. Of course what makes them different from the likes of Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore and the likes is that they have a distinct European flavor to them. Whether that should be a repellent or attraction, is certainly up to you.<br />The negative aspects often get overshadowed by those who enjoy the album very much. However, let's be realistic here. The lyrics are repetitive, music is synthesized, the vocals are high and almost close screaming, yet what makes this so special? That leads us to the positive aspects.<br />tATu's debut album is full of energy and of course, it's wonderful to hear something different in America. While many of the radio stations are overwhelmed with R&amp;B tracks or pop R&amp;B or punk, metal, rock and the likes, tATu provides us with some European pop. With the overplayed track 'All The Things She Said' being the lead single to the soft and 'Russian-sounding' piano track '30 minutes' to the techno inspired 'Not Gonna Get Us.' This album basically covers several genres while blending them into one genre that we could call 'Techno/ Electronica Pop.' <br />Overall, if you're looking for a wonderful composed masterpiece, look somewhere else. However, if you enjoy pop albums and don't really care about the gimmick, then I say this album is for you. First listen to the sound clips, if you like them, chances are you'll enjoy the rest of the album. After all it's only 11 tracks.<br />The Cd comes enhanced with a interview with tATu and music video for 'All The Things She Said.' A nice bonus, but perhaps the album is a little meager in tracks.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is my new addiction!  They have totally created a new genre of music and each song on the CD keeps you excited and going.  I first heard of Maroon 5 on the Abercormbie.com website and it had recommended them as a download.  I loved the song 'Harder To Breathe' so much, I went out and searched for the CD!  Now songs like 'This Love', 'Shiver', 'She Will be Loved', and 'Tangled' have made me want more Maroon 5 music! And yes, they shouldnt be doing any opening acts, they need to be making concerts!  They definitely can get noticed, they just need to be publicized more!(haha.. sp?) I recommend it to anyone!
B00009V7T2|3.0|Everyone that i talk to LOVE these guys.I just dont get them.I like At The Drive In and everything and i have a HUGE open mind but these guys dont make any sense.I think if this cd was instrumental and had no vocals this would be a good cd.But however notice i gave it 3 stars.Thats because the music on this cd is great.Some of the break downs without vocals just make you beat your head up and down but other than that there is nothing really to sneeze about.This is AVERAGE AT BEST.I dont understand why everybody thinks these guys are the best things since sliced bread.<br />Bottom Line, Very eclectic.If your getting this because you like at the drive in you might be dissapointed.However this is not a bad cd.I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest that you download some songs before you pick this one up.
B000002UVX|5.0|For anyone who believes Hendrix was over-rated, listen to this! The guitar work on this album is extraordinary and there are no studio effects to enhance it. <br />New Years Eve 1969/1970, Hendrix teamed up with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox to perform soulful rock with a message. A message of love. From the funky opening riff of \\"Who Knows?\\", the listener knows immediately that Hendrix has changed direction. The music is full of soul and as we go on through the disc, we find it is also full of love.<br />The anti-war statement of Machine Gun is possibly one of the most historic live rock and roll moments next to Dylan's '66 Albert Hall retaliation and Jimi's own Star Spangled Banner performance. Using the instruments as weapons, the musicians create a vivid image of the horrors of Vietnam. <br />The song Message of Love is also incredible and perfectly demonstrates the chemistry between the power-trio. All three, even while playing separate rhythms, sound like they are all in unison.<br />But the thing that stands out the most is the guitar. The sounds Hendrix creates are out of this world. He was at his peak and it is a real shame that he died shortly after this recording. There's no telling where he could have taken music.

B00008LDPU|5.0|To anyone who is familiar with Anime, or Japanimation, the Japanese influences on the makers of the Matrix should be clear. The energy and style of the action scenes in this sci-fi modern classic are borrowed directly from the classic Anime features of the 80s and 90s like Ghost In The Shell, Akira and Ninja Scroll. What we see in Animatrix is a fascinating project: The best directors and animators in Japanime were approached by the Wachowski Bros. to create short animated stories taking place in the reality of the Matrix saga. The result: nine short films by seven different directors. Each of the creators took the ideas that make the Matrix to entirely different ends, and each film uses different styles and techniques of animation and storytelling. Not one of them is traditional Japanese animation, and though each one borrows from its old and respectable roots, each one is surprising and unique in a very different way. That makes this compilation of the nine films a very rewarding watching experience, if you're interested in either the Matrix or animation in general, or both.<br />The first segment, The Final Flight Of The Osiris, is a direct prequel to Matrix Reloaded, though it features none of the lead characrers from the movies. It's my least favorite movie in the series, but makes for a good start to the collection. The animation here is entirely computerized 3D graphics, and as technology goes it's the most impressive film in the series.<br />The two part movie The Second Renaissance (directed by Mahiro Maeda) looks more like traditional anime. It's essential for eager Matrix fans, because it chronicles the Second Renaissance and man's war against the machines - events that were only referred to in the movie Matrix. It's a fascinating watch, more for the story than for the animation.<br />Kid's Story (directed by the brilliant Shinichirô Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame) is the first movie here that really caught my attention. A rather small story about one ofthe many people who realized the truth about the Matrix and were freed to reality (with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss doing small cameos), the animation on Kid's Story is as far as you can get from any kind of traditional animation, Japanese or otherwise. It's energetic, powerful, and hypnotically beautiful.<br />The World Records was created by Takeshi Koike (director) and Yoshiaki Kawajiri (writer), the immensely talented team that worked together on the cult classic Ninja Scroll. Koike's very unique art style comes on strongly on this segment, with his deformed characters, exaggerated motion and expression and very strong shadowing, and the characters' motion is strong and beautiful.<br />The Program, directed by Kawajiri himself, is relatively closer to classic anime, but it's well written and has good energy. Not one of my favorites, though.<br />A Detective Story was both written and directed by Shinichirô Watanabe. Unlike his other work, Kid's Story, a Detective Story greatly resembles his work on Cowboy Bebop. It blends the atmosphere and clichés of classic film noir into the Matrix reality, and has great writing and animation. The art is in black on white, with a great gritty texture that gives it a real film noir feel.<br />Beyond is a rather small story about children in Japan who find a `haunted house', where objects appear and disappear, and people can float in the air and defy the rules of nature - actually, of course it's just a glitch in the Matrix and the Agents are soon sent to remedy the situation. The long scene of the children playing in the haunted house is beautiful and imaginative, and wonderfully animated.<br />Matriculated, the final segment, is a very difficult and disturbing one, and I didn't really care for the choice of putting it last in the series. Psychedelic and very philosophical, Matriculated is shown mainly from a machine's point of view.<br />The bonus features on the DVD are also fantastic: they include fascinating documentaries on all each film, and also on the project in general and on the history and tradition of Japanese animation. For animation enthusiasts, this DVD is a must.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm sure we've all fallen (no pun intended) in love with the 'Bring Me To Life' single that's playing on the radio. I did, and immediately rushed out to buy this album, not expecting any of the tracks to even sound remotely like it (the fate of many records nowdays).<br />Imagine my surprise when I found such a lovely gem! Evanescence has burst out of the woodworks, and I hope they're here to stay. They mix a wonderful sound of hard guitars and synth, and soft, soaring, wistful vocals provided by Amy Lee. If you're trying to figure out what they sound like, cross Garbage with Linkin Park and throw some romantic fantasy in there. What you get is not quite goth, not quite metal, not quite girl-rock that seems to blend effortlessly and create an amazing listen.<br />'Going Under' is the first track on the album, and the next single, and it's very catchy.  Amy's voice growls and then soars, and I find myself humming this song all day long.<br />'Bring Me To Life' is the same as the classic on the radio, and I'm very glad they left Paul (from 12 Stone) on the track -- so often bands take their 'guest' off the actual record and the song suffers.<br />'Everybody's Fool'--A weaker track with a gutsy message, about how pretending to be something you aren't doesn't fool anyone.<br />'My Immortal' -- the most haunting track on the album, and a personal favorite of mine. It's so simple and pure that it seems a-cappella and almost out of place, but I like the nice change from the driving rock to the sentimental side.<br />'Haunted' and 'Tourniquet' are great rock songs, and a good choice for the middle of the album. While some folks have mistaken 'Tourniquet' for a Christian song, I don't really think that is the case -- it's more of a song about suicide, and wondering what is on the other side.<br />'Imaginary' is a delight, with lyrics a day-dreamer would love about a fantasy world, and not wanting to wake up from dreams. I absolutely love this song. It's such a fun, fantastical side to them that one rarely sees in rock nowdays (save for perhaps Linkin Park videos).<br />'Taking Over Me' and 'Hello' aren't two of my favorite tracks, but they're still easy to listen to and fit seamlessly with the album. 'Hello' is another slow song.<br />My favorite songs on the album are the next two -- 'My Last Breath' and 'Whisper'. They're powerful, haunting, and somehow manage to sound unique in comparison to the rest of the album. I love them!<br />Enough with the gushing. If you're thinking about Evanescence and buying the album because you like 'Bring Me To Life' but are afraid that it will be the only great, rock-driven song on the album, don't worry! You'll love it. Also, if you're worried that it's too 'goth' or too 'christian', don't worry about that either. Evanescence toes the line between several genres and manages to find a sound entirely their own.ical side to them that one rarely sees in rock nowdays (save for perhaps Linkin Park videos).<br />'Taking Over Me' and 'Hello' aren't two of my favorite tracks, but they're still easy to listen to and fit seamlessly with the album.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This album has so much to offer, and it's so much better than a lot of \\"popular\\" music that's out right now.  Not that the other stuff is bad, but it's refreshing to listen to something that doesn't sound so derived or contrived.
B000003RCY|5.0|Great songs. How E.A Poe can you get besides Heirate Mich..where a guy is at a cemetary digging up his dead love and her flesh tears away like paper?<BR>Der Meister..very apocalyptic...Asche Zu Asche is great and I LOVE ..Seeman. Seeman is very poignant, very beautiful, brings tears to my eyes. &quot;Come into my boat, a storm is coming, the night is near&quot; It has a different sound than all the other songs and is a great juxtaposition .<BR> In Sehnsucht, I like Engel and Du Hast.
B000099T2L|3.0|I never wanted to do this, but I feel compelled to give Beyonce Knowles some credit.  A few years back, we gave her hell for being the stuck-up princess in Destiny's Child, but she ignored the haters and smartly turned herself into a one-lady institution.  Burning the candle at both ends under a tight schedule, Beyonce has done modeling, acting, and now she's finally released the solo album we all knew was coming: \\"Dangerously in Love.\\"  The album is sporadically successful in presenting a mature Knowles, but the material doesn't always deliver on its promise to be a powerhouse r&b record.  The disc falters mainly on the uptempo tunes, many of which just don't kick.  \\"Naughty Girl\\" falls flat even as it borrows the groove from Donna Summer's \\"Love to Love You Baby;\\" \\"Baby Boy\\" is dumbed-down dancehall fluff featuring reggae flavor du jour Sean Paul, and \\"Hip Hop Star\\" with Sleepy Brown and Big Boi lacks both the hip and hop to make it remotely danceable.  \\"Dangerously in Love\\" improves on the ballads which make the best use of Beyonce's voice.  You can't say \\"no\\" to the seductive groove of \\"Yes\\" while Missy Elliott guests on the solid \\"Signs.\\"  And she shows that she can hold her own against an r&b veteran like Luther Vandross on their cover of \\"The Closer I Get to You.\\"  But the album's best track is \\"Speechless,\\" a slow jam inspired by the old school that's so smokin' it almost saves the rest of the album.  \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is ultimately spotty and weighed down by too many subpar tracks, but there's enough material to prove that she does have potential when paired with the right collaborators (she co-produced much of the album herself).  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6.
0385504209|5.0|This book was one not to put down.  It was the first of Dan Brown's books I have read, and I guarantee it will not be the last.  The way in which the author weaves in facts and historical theories is amazing.  I enjoyed the story and learned a lot too. Perhaps Mr. Brown should try writing texts books, I guarentee students would retain a lot more knowledge if he did!
B00008PC2O|5.0|After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old \\"bigger is better\\" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: \\"I'll be back!\\" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.<br />The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's \\"come and get it!\\" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD.
0452282152|4.0|I picked up this book to read after a friend of mine raved about it.  I think that because of her love for the book I went in with high expecatations.  I will give it this: it was a fun read, an easy read, and a midly entertaining read.  I just felt that it was a little too bland and just shy of really making an impression.  If you are look for relief from heavier and more challenging read, then this book would be perfect.
B000099T2L|1.0|From these obvious fanatics of Beyonce.  I was expected a lot from her solo project but it is so boring, some of the songs will literally put you to sleep! Nothing on the album deserves a 10, at best it deserves a C+.  If you like buying average to poor music that you can hear on every radio station across the country get this one.  Otherwise, you should pass this one up.  It sounds rushed, the lyrics are very childish, and the ONLY reason why this album is getting any attention at all is because it's from the Destiny's Child front woman.<br />It's really not worth the buy.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I like to think that I know my metal.  I grew up on Pantera, Metallica, Slayer, and the likes of thrash.  As it is now, I've gotten older, and I like the newer, death/thrash stuff a lot now, i.e. Shadow's Fall, Killswitch Engage, Opeth, In Flames, Superjoint Ritual (still love Phil) etc.  When I bought this album, I expected a good album with some headbanging stuff, and the like.  What I got was an insanely heavy record that makes me proud to enjoy the metal I've grown to love.<br />This album is simply incredible.  It kicks you... right off the bat with \\"Ruin,\\" a pummeling track that has some of the coolest guitar parts put to record. (Also, a ...breakdown that sounds like a heavier-than-thou Slayer) It does not have a single bad song on the entire record.  It's a little short (38 min), but it destroys you the entire record.  Every song is brilliant, with amazing drumming, fantastic guitar work, and brutal bass.  Also, R. Blythe is one of the most amazing vocalists on the planet.  If you're not into the \\"EXTREME\\" style of singing, then imagine Phil Anselmo on Suicide Note, Pt. 2, and you'll get a good idea of what this guy is going for.  But that's not all.  He blows away most extreme vocalists with his pure intensity, and amazing presence.  He makes the band go from \\"great\\" to \\"lengedary.\\"<br />A truly amazing record, from start to finish, and one that any metal fan should immediately purchase.  This one will stay in your CD player for quite a while.<br />Favorite tracks:  11th Hour, Ruin, Vigil, In Defense of Our Good Name
0385504209|1.0|...which is really only intended to showcase a set of outrageous historical howlers.<br />This book is a transparent attempt to undermine the faith of Christians -- and to pad the author's bank account.<br />What begins as a fairly nifty thriller -- the first 75 pages or so are diverting, I do admit -- quickly gets bogged down in wildly inaccurate claims about the Catholic Church which any casual student of European history will be able to see through.<br />The characters are totally static, standing there like featureless beaches upon which bogus historical &quot;explanations&quot; hammer interminably, wave upon wave upon wave.<br />I only finished this bilious pile because relatives asked me to. I think they secretly feared that the &quot;fascinating esoterica of history&quot;-- as, I believe, the above review put it -- was true.<br />But not to fear. This book is neither &quot;fascinating&quot; nor historical. It is pure fiddle-faddle, and don't waste your time or your money.
B00008H2LB|5.0|First off, let's get some things straight. Linkin Park are NOT heavy/thrash/death metal. They've never claimed to be and most certainly do not make music that would fit into any of those categories. <br />Therefore, Meteroa is not an album that can be classfied in any of the above genres. What Meteora is however, is an excellent fusion of rock, hip hop, eletronica with undercurrents of true pop running beneath it all. It's a heady mix, much like the record's illustrious predecessory, Hybrid Theory. Meteora takes the best parts of Hybrid Theory and magnifys them plentyfold. It's a maturer, more tunefulbut harder rocking Linkin Park that appears on this album. The songs are tight and quick, there are no fillers here. Each and every song has a point and provides a link from the preceding song to the forthcoming one. The whole band sounds tighter and more attuned to each other, the vocalists blend and meld together with astonishing ease, and yet maintain their individual styles without outshining the other. No one part overcomes the other, the guitars are superbly complemented by the bass, the drumming mixes excellently with the DJ's scratching, which in turn provides an edge for the vocalists to take and shape into their own special style. Not one strand of music is wasted and the sheer musicianship that is present in Meteora really should be applauded. I'm tired of being taken for a ride by bands who think that two good songs on album will automatically negate ten other songs that sound awful, with no thought or care going into the recording or mixing. Who cares about guitar solos and the like when you can listen to songs that are not only intricately layered but also so individually and thus collectively complete?<br />This album isn't the most revolutionary, nor does it claim to be. It's a band doing what they do best, trailing a blazing path through which their contemporaries must either adher to or wither away when the inevitable comparisons begin. What it is is astatement of intent: that Linin Park are here to stay. And thank God for that.
B00003CWNR|1.0|Tobey Maguire is good as always and Charlize Theron has a laughable excuse for a southern accent.    This movie poorly illustrates the theme that there are difficult decisions in life - that not all decisions are black-and-white:  the main character doesn't seem to face any more significant moral dilemnas besides the one in the Cider House.      He gives up hope in the world outside the orphanage he grew up in:  after losing in love and dealing with a shocking situation, he conservatively retreats to a comfortable life of familiarity.      I heard the book is better.
B00005QB42|3.0|This is a very nice album.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Still not the best for my money, however.  I would much rather listen to Zade's new self titled album.  That's what I call art.  Zade is AMAZING.  Deva is just pretty good.  That's my opinion.
B00008DDSC|2.0|I'm going to keep this as short as possible, as I have a tendency to write really long reviews and if I spend too much time expressing disdain for anything I get very depressed.<br />I was very dissapointed with this movie. I suppose I was deceived by the fact that it was playing at the Angelika when I went to see All the Real Girls (a far better, far sweeter, indie romance). I think this is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Director Steven Shainberg uses dull, uncreative angles, which don't help the struggling script. James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both very good on their own, but don't work well together. The &quot;awkward&quot; pauses between conversation are too long, making it seem like both actors are silently counting to a number before saying their next line. The whole &quot;love story&quot; doesn't seem to fit. There is no gradual falling in love between the two throughout the course of the movie. Rather, Lee (Gyllenhaal) runs out of her boyfriends house in her wedding dress and tells Grey (Spader) she loves him. It's as if Shainberg uses it to justify the whole BDSM-thing. He dumps this pseudo-sentimental litter on our laps and expects us to take it. I didn't buy it. This isn't a love story, this is a failed indie romance. We're supposed to feel for the characters, but I don't. They just seem like they're lonely, sad people who can't help themselves.<br />Controversial movies about the taboos of society can be great, if the director is talented and the screenplay is good. Alas, the director is inexperienced, the script is weak, and the movie suffers for it. Not a good pick for a summer afternoon.
0393057658|5.0|I have been a baseball fan all my life. I have never read a better book on the business of baseball. If you have wondered why the Oakland A's seem to keep uncovering new talent to replace that which they lose to free agency - READ THIS BOOK!  Michael Lewis does more than explain this phenomenon he tells a compelling story. The book is well investigated and extremely well written. This book makes so, so much sense. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANY SPORTS FAN.
B00005KFUM|5.0|how have so many people been kept in the dark about muse!?!? as if their last album wasn't great enough, this disc showcases their best song yet, &quot;plug in baby,&quot; which gives you great gitar, refrain, and towards the end the singer shows why his voice is so special, he has a range of like 4 octives! his voice just chills my veins, and i have listened to this album until the cd pretty much melted. i cannot wait until they reach the top of the charts, because whenever people hear this stuff, they will go crazy. chances are, if you're here, you have heard of it! which is good, they need more publicity because their music is getting progressively better every album. share this with your friends, if they enjoy stuff that isn't annoyingly mainstream. download the &quot;plug in baby&quot; video too, it's an gives an interesting twist to the song.
B000002U82|4.0|This album was on the top 100 chart for 14 years! its a great album and it blows &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Animals,&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; away!<br />-Speak To Me/Breath, a cool intro to the album and then it kicks into this song with lyrics about a never ending day of work 4/5<br />-On The Run, its a really cool keyboard type instrumental and if you close your eyes while listenin you can imagine someone being chased by something while the musics playing! 4/5<br />-Time, this is the best Pink Floyd song ever I love the lyrics and the solo shows just how talented Devid Gilmour is! 5/5<br />-The Great Gig In The Sky, this is just some chicks singin but for some reason I really like it 4/5<br />-Money, this has a very cool riff and this to has one of Gilmour best guita solos along with &quot;Time&quot; and Roger Waters' lyrics are awsome cause its true! 5/5<br />-Us And Them, sometimes I like this song and other times I hate this song with a passion! 3/5<br />-Any Colour You Like, Another great instrumental as only Pink Floyd would do 4/5<br />-Brain Damage, I love the riff in this song and the lyrics are a tribute to former frontman Sydd Barret who was rocks first Acid/LSD tragety, he has been M.I.A. for more then 30 years<br />-Eclipse, alos a tribute to Syyd and one of Floyds best songs when played right after Brain Damage.<br />So as you see this album is truly essential or do you? Take A listen and once you but like I know you will put The Wizerd Of Ozz on mute and play this album along with and its really cool!
B00004XONN|5.0|just like i said, it's a love or hate album. i absolutely love it, and yes, i was a radiohead fan before this album. many people who own the previos albums like Pablo Honey or OK Computer didn't like this album because it strayed away from Radiohead's type of music. However, if you can get past that, which is not very hard to do, just open your mind a little, this album is brilliant. Thom Yorke's voice rings in your head, and the electronica type of music here is a new attempt for them and it really works. well. &quot;Idioteque&quot; is just one of those songs that makes you want to dance, as their website, Greenplastic.com mentions, it can be seen as either an &quot;attempt at a cheesy disco song&quot; or &quot;absolutely brilliant.&quot; i choose the latter, because not too many songs make me want to jump around like this one does. and i listen to a lot of music. it can be played during work, to lull you to sleep, to wake you up, for sports, wherever, and that's what really defines an album's greatness, its versatility. like i said, love it or hate it, it'll be great for those with an open mind and who dont listen to all those people who say it's not the real radiohead. these guys just know how to make music, plain and simple.
B000002H97|5.0|This was when Metallica stoped being a Thrash band and became a mainstream Hard rock band. Most Metallica fans dont like this album but I love it, its my second favorite Metallica album (Ride The Lightning be my favorite) ever.<br />-Enter Sandman, there is no dening that this is a great Hard rock song, this is probly their most peopular song ever! 5/5<br />-Sad But True, this is the best song on the album and one of my favorite songs of all time, great solo by Hammet and Jaames Hetfield is on the top of his game lyricly and vocaly and Lars' drummung is over the top. 5/5<br />-Holier Than Thou, this is a straight metal song and its awsome 4/5<br />-The Unforgivin, part 2 is alot better but this song is still really good as well and one of Hammets best solos 4/5<br />-Wherever I may Roam, one of the strongest tracks on the album and it has an amazing solo 5/5<br />-Dont Tread On Me, this is a Metal song all the way but for me the only good thing is the cool riff at the begining 2/5<br />-Through The Never, I love this song its the second best on the album and this is in Hammets top solos ever! 5/5<br />-Nothing Else Matters, Metallicas attempt at a Power ballad but it actually rocks! 4/5<br />-Of Wolf and Man, a great Metal song with cool lyrics I wish they would have made a video for this 5/5<br />-The God That Faild, this is an alright song not one of their best you could say! 3/5<br />-My Freind Of Misery, gret, great song nothing wrong with this one, but it reminds me of my mom for some reason 5/5<br />-The Strugle Within, I just think this is a great rock song 3/5<br />one of Metallicas best if you dont belive me take a listen for your self!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought the best album of the year yesterday. 'De-loused in the comatorium'. In case you've had your head under a rock for the past few months, it's the debut album by The Mars Volta, and incase you're a Britney Spears fan you'll probably know that The Mars Volta consists of Omar Rodriguez and Cedric Bixler who were partly, if not mostly responible for one of the most amazing and important rock bands of recent times (at the drive-in, duh!). <br />I've been waiting for this record ever since they gave us that tasty three song EP. Boy have they kept us waiting, but damn me if it wasn't worth the wait! I knew this album was going to be amazing when I saw TMV live, but I had absoultely no idea it was going to be THIS damn mindblowing. I walked three miles into town and 3 miles back to pick up this album. It was burning a hole in my pocket all the way home, it was like an orgasm when I finally got it out of the case and put it into my stereo while looking through the artwork. Then I laid back in bed, closed my eyes and let the my mind get lost in this music. It just took me over, it's so amazing. It's a concept album, about a close friend of Omar and Cedric who was in a coma for a long time. It basically follows this guy in a coma as he travels through some bizzare, subconscious world. Now I know all of this makes this record sound terrible. By the rules of EVERYTHING prog rock and concept albums usually make for horrible listening, unless it's pink floyd, in which case, we'll let you off. We'll also let The Mars Volta off too, because no matter how pretentious the whole concept of this album sounds, no matter how much you're expecting capes and 30 minute organ solos, once you listen to this album you forget all about that shit. This is Prog with punk rock ideals. The music is convicted with so much aggression, energy and verve that it's hard not to get completely and utterly lost in it. The band continually barrage you with extremely loud, disjointed guitar riffs, skull shattering bass, and pyschotic keyboards. This is topped off with effects and sound manipulation by Jeremy Ward, who sadly recently lost his life. His influence can be heard allover this record, which would undoubtley be half the album it is without his work, which makes it all the more potent. All of this fits perfectly with Cedric's vocals, which go from gentle crooning and verge upon screaming falsetto.<br />The musicians occasionally break down into free form jams which incorporate jazz, blues, funk, dub, punk and a thousand other musical influences (ok maybe not a thousand, but you get the picture). Despite all of this, it's still very much a rock record, and no matter how challenging it sometimes gets this record still has a great sense of melody. It's by no means a mainstream album, and it wont be for everyone but it has enough hooks to keep you drawn in, and sometimes make you shake your ass. This record does what all truely groundbreaking records do, it challenges, it experiments, it attempts to revolutionize rock all while never really alienating the person listening to it. This is what makes albums like 'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band', 'Pet Sounds' 'Marquee Moon', 'OK Computer' such awe inspiring and influential pieces of music. I truely Believe that 'De-Loused in The Comatorium' will be remembered alongside such records.<br />It's a truely unbelievably amazing piece of music. From the beginning keyboard arpeggio and haunting organ of first track 'Son Et Lumiere' to the final breakdown of 'Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt' it never lets off, it's a musical journey which once it's over you have to stop and try and make sense of everything that just happened, then play it over again. I know it's a cliche to say so, but this really is an album that has to be heard for yourself. So go out and buy it. Nothing can stop The Mars Volta now.
B000002JS6|5.0|Look its as simple as this Back In Black is one of the best albums of all time. If you were to make a list it would be in the top 5. This is where new front man Brian Johnson filled in for the late great Bon Scott. Brain was the perfect man to step in and I actually like him better then Bon if you can believe it. This album was a tribute to Bon. \\"Hells Bells is my favorite AC/DC song its dark and scary. \\"Back In Black\\" is the best three chord rock song ever! \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" is Angus' best guitar solo! \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" was a tribute to Bon. There are no flaws on Back In Black! `All killer no filler' Angus' solos are amazing. Malcolm's riffs are great. Phil and Cliff's rhythm is tighter then ever and Brian is amazing as I said. Not a bad song on the album. \\"Rock N' Roll Aint Noise Pollution\\" is a great rock anthem. This is AC/DC best album because the band never sounded so good. \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\" is Brian's best vocals ever! It doesn't get much better then this so pick this up! Because you wont regret it! Believe the hype.

B000069HK2|5.0|I had to pick up this CD after seeing The Used live at the KROQ Weenie Roast for the first time.  They absolutely blew my mind - what a performance! Almost every song rocks, great drums, great riffs, great vocals (even the screaming really pumps me up).  Bert's voice is just awesome - from the screaming to the melodies - so raw and full of life.  Support this band!  Go buy this CD and go see them live - you won't be disappointed!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Hypnotic patterns draw you in and lead through a musical labrynth. This album is as much visual as it is auditory. De-Loused in the Comatorium is a concept album set around the trials of one Cerpain Taxt. In Taxt's attempt to commit suicide, he falls into a coma for a time and this is where the album beings. Taxt is thrown into a world (via his comatic stuper) completely different from our own yet symbolically congruent. His journey through this world leads him on an almost reverse initiation which is represented to us in the form of music. The songs are pact with so much intensity that the listener almost becomes Cerpain Taxt. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler Zavala (the founders and conceptual inovators of the album) have made an album that is almost arrogant it's so good. Rodriguez-Lopez's guitar playing is very angular and rythmic, and in my opinion probably the driving force behind the music. Zavala's has a surisingly wide vocal range. I mean he almost sounds like Freddy Mercury, but much more serious...of course, no leather chaps here. The keyboards, amazing percussion, and a little help from Flea, of Red Hot Chili Pepers fame, ties everything together incredibly well. EVERYONE in this band does their part to their fullest ability and it has really shown. This stuff is up there with Sonic Youth and Pink Floyd. I think I'm just so excited to hear people this incredibly serious and passionate about music and creating music with meaning that I can't say enough. Just buy this for your own good...seriously. Yeah, I'll shut up now.
B00009RDG9|5.0|So, If you like action and great actors, this is the film to whatch. The Hunted, is a movie that is pretty much focus on knife fighting and what happens when you trained someone to kill and then that person can't stop killing. This movie is great, with great performances by two Academy Award Winning Actors, Yeah that's right Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones. <br />This movie is for people who like and enjoy whatching movies, not for people whom sit a theater talk all the time without paying attention to the movie then come here and write a bad review about the film. For those BUNCH OF RUGRATS WITH NO CLASS AND WHOM DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES A FILM A GREAT FILM PLEASE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THEM. <br />Buy this DVD of THE HUNTED, you wont regreat it! I guaranteed you!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Sparta sounds like a watered down version of at the drive in, the Mars Volta on the other hand is pure genius. Cedric has changed his vocal style, since every band under the sun seems to be mimicking his frantic off key caterwauling from when he fronted ATDI. His vocals are now more focused, you can really get a sense of how good a singer he is.
B000062TU1|5.0|This movie was extravagant, the actors are phenomenal and the special effects are also very good. But one thing, IT'S HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE! I'm sorry but this really got on my nerves, the title was made up by J.K.Rowling, and should be left at it, I mean, they didn't change any of the other titles, (i.e. The Chamber of Secrets didn't become The chamber of deaths or anything), but why change the first one, I'm sure Americans know what a philosopher is, oh, and they changed some of the words (crisps to chips, chips to fries etc) which really wasn't necessary.<br />     Harry Potter and The Philosophersstone was a marvellous film, but please american publishers, KEEP THE BLOODY ORIGINAL NAME!
B00009P1O2|5.0|Very awesome concert, I could listen to this all day. The preformance was one perfection. QUEEN gave the crowd what they wanted. Action, excitement and a ton of music. This is the real thing.<br />What always impressed me of QUEEN is how they include their fans in singing the songs with them.<br /><br />QUEEN is not a heavy metal band like so many out there. Listen to the audiance sing \\"Love of my life\\" with Freddie. I have seen so many of their concerts from other countries and no matter what language they speak the crowd can still sing with QUEEN.<br /><br />Freddie Mercury is what made QUEEN so popular from the early 70's to even now almost 13 years after the tragic death of Freddie Mercury. Watching this video you will feel Freddie's  presence.<br /><br />This DVD is a must for any QUEEN Fan. Do yourself a favor and get it, you will be glad you did, and the price is very affordable.<br /><br />QUEEN FOREVER!
B000084T18|4.0|I got this CD b/c of the songs I'd heard on the radio, of course, but later found that I can listen to most of this CD without pressing the FF button.  Of these other songs, I like &quot;Many Men&quot; probably the best b/c it seems to get stuck in my head throughout the day.  I would definitely recommend this album.
B000099T2L|4.0|<br />Here it is, the album we've all been waiting for. Hopefully this review will answer all your questions.<br />1. Is Beyoncé's album the best out of the 3 Destiny's Child members solo projects?<BR>YES<br />2. Is the sound of the album like any other previous DC stuff?<BR>Basically... NO<br />3. Is Beyoncé's solo version of \\"Dangerously In Love\\" (\\"Dangerously In Love 2\\") better than the DC version?<BR>In a word... NO<br />The Breakdown:<br />1. Crazy In Love feat. Jay-Z - 5/5<br />We all love this song, it's on the radio, it's got trumpets and an old school Hip Hop vibe, the chemistry (in and out of the studio) with Jay-Z is great, we love it.<br />2. Naughty Girl 5/5<BR>A sexy midtempo Middle Eastern inspired track. A little reminiscent of \\"Kama Sutra\\" by Ruff Endz.<br />3. Baby Boy feat. Sean Paul - 5/5<BR>I like this song but, why does every R&B female (Beyoncé, Blu Cantrell [Breathe], Mya [Things Come And Go] off her new album \\"Moodring\\" coming out this July) feel the need to have Sean Paul on their album? What is he, the new black or something? This could be a popular radio/club song though, it just sounds like any R&B chick could've sung it.<br />4. Hip Hop Star feat.Big Boi and Big Boi and Sleepy Brown - 2.5/5<BR>I'm really not feeling this one either. I like the edgy rock vibe it has to it but like the previous track it doesn't showcase Beyoncé's writing skills and I'm feeling no chemistry between her and Big Boi.<br />5. Be With You - 6/5<BR>A sexy midtempo groove, the best song on the album, singlewothy.<br />6. Me Myself And I - 6/5<BR>It has the same vibe as the previous song but a little more inspirational.<br />7. Yes - 5/5<BR>Finally an, R&B song that deals with a new situation! I Won't give it away though.<br />8. Signs feat. Missy Elliott - 4/5<BR>A point off for weirdness and that part where they rewind the song, why was that needed? The song was perfect the way it was.<br />9. Speechless - 5/5<BR>Soulful, sexy, and midtempo.<br />10. That'sHow You Like It feat. Jay-Z - 5/5<BR>A nice flirty midtempo groove.<br />11. The Closer I Get To You feat. Luther Vandross 4.5/5<BR>We all know this song, a great duet, that gets faded out too early.<br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - 3.5/5<BR>Okay, but it can't touch the original, there's a slight change in music and the vocals are resung but it lacks the beauty of the first one. I know that this song is close to Beyoncé's heart and she wanted to include it but she should have redone it accoustically and added that great ending she added to it on Saturday Night Live.<br />13. Beyoncé Interlude - (not rated or averaged)<BR>Beyoncé talking about some stuff.<br />14. Gift From Virgo - 4.5/5<BR>A beautiful song that's way too short.<br />15. Daddy (bonus track) - 5/5<BR>A touching beautiful song Beyoncé dedicates to her father. She should write a song about her Mama too for making all them clothes. :)<br />Well that's it. No \\"Work It Out\\" or \\"Can't Take It No More\\" as bonus tracks like alot of people thought. <br />Here's the final averaged grade: 4.714 <BR>That rounds out to 4.5

0783222955|5.0|'To Kill a Mockingbird' the only written Pulitzer Prize classic by Harper Lee to gain so much in literary or film history. It has become not only a tale of a single father's love for his two children but a social commentary of socialism, racism and injustice. Director Robert Mulligan delivers Lee's classic with such precision that the book translation into the film reatined it's quality with nothing lost. What other films taken from books can say that? It has made the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of top 100 films of all time. It's considered one of the finest examples of family drama ever made. Even though set in a 1932 Depression-era Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, in history it still remains timeless. It's message still remains powerfully strong and resounding in our American society today. It still defends the cause of tolerance, justice, sound morals and responsible, loving single parenthood.<br /><br />This message is just as very much important today as it was then. I recommend this to people of all ages. The courtroom drama is beyond mundane or formality. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two. This is one of his best performances that got him the Oscar at the Academy Awards in 1962. He takes on with compassion the defense of a black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape and murder of a young white woman. His children Scout (Mary Badham) who tells the story and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) learn about racial prejudice and hatred. They also overcome their fear of a mysterious, obscure and silent neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant screen debut). Some of the best classic lines from the movie when Atticus has a quiet moment with his children. If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. And he tells them about it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. The mockingbird was different from all the other birds...because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.<br /><br />What comes from this beautifully told film is a shining, intense drama that cleverly extracts the ideas of Harper Lee's heartfelt classic, a tremendously talented group of American actors brought together in one film and the magic of devoted artistry of screenplay and an outstanding score. It's strength has survived all the madness and complexity of today's so-called Hollywood cinema. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is truly an all-time classic that speaks for itself.ells them about it was a sin to kill a mockingbird.

0375422307|5.0|Never before have I read a graphic novel that moved me through so many emotions in such a short amount of time. Satrapi writes about and draws her adolescence in Iran during the country's periods of the revolution and war. She also allows us to see how she was feeling at those times (mostly, it seems, she was feeling rebellious).<br />She tells us what it's like for females to suddenly be forced to wear a veil when outside their homes. She covers some of her own amazing family history (her great-grandfather was Iran's last emperor). She also talks of Iran's war with Iraq in the early 80's and it's only too relevant to our current events. What's more, she's funny. Watching &quot;Marji&quot; as a little girl in the book, re-acting to situations as only a little girl would, you're able to sympathize, if not empathize.<br />I saw Satrapi speak at this year's Book Expo America and I walked away with a with a feeling that this woman is part artist, part rebel, part humanitarian and part historian. She's also very very funny. When asked whether or not she's want a movie based on her memoir, she said [heavy French accent], &quot;No, I don't think so. I think they would make it too much like 'Never Without my Daughter'.&quot; Right now, she's working on a sequel to Persepolis.<br />You should read this.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is one the best R&amp;B albums I have purchased this year.  I am glad that she grew as an artist and we get to see another side of Beyonce's vocal talents and writing talents.  I hope her mature lyrics and soulful sound will be featured in the next DC album.  She really did take us back to when people heard her on writings on the wall.  My favorite songs on this album are Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, &amp; The Closer I get to YOu.  I love the whole album from beginning to end.  The Bonus track is so touching.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is one of those movies that actually deserves it's Oscar for Best Picture.  There are many things about this movie that make it so good.  First of all, from an artistic standpoint, it's amazing.  The cinematography is awesome, and the story is very captivating.  It's obviously a satire on the stereotypical suburban life, and the acting in the movie is spectacular, especially Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning.  The film has its funny moments, and its very dramatic moments, and it's an extremely well-done movie.  The story is very deep, and it stirs thought from the viewer when it's over, and it also has a great message:  enjoy all the little things that are beautiful in life, while you still can, because they're all over the place.  I definitely recommend this movie.

After reading so many positive reviews, I have tried to like them, but find them just terribly affected. Leave the blues numbers to musicians with more soul, and Meg--please take some drum lessons.

0060278250|2.0|To be honest, I was real disappointed with this book. I know it took a lot of work and all, but Sabriel's originality and mature theme is unmatched. It didn't have me hooked like Sabriel did. A lot of people have said that Nix has dumbed down the writing... and in all honestly I agree. Sabriel is a fantastic book though, and so is Shade's children. This book had a lot of potential, and although it had its unique qualities it didn't really move me. Check it out anyway and see for yourself.

B00005JMC6|4.0|WHALE RIDER comes from New Zealand, and opens with a Maori mother giving birth to twins, a son and a daughter. Unfortunately, the mother and son die in the delivery room. The father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), is left with only his infant daughter, Pai.<br />A dozen years later, Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives in a Maori seashore community with her grandparents, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) and Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). Koro is the tribal leader, the direct descendent of the original leader who, according to legend, came with his people from a faraway place on the backs of whales. Koro and hoped that his eldest son, Porourangi, would become chief, but the latter, after the death of his wife and son, left for Europe to become an artist. Koro is devastated by the loss of his male descendents. Though he loves Pai dearly, he consciously and deliberately excludes her from consideration as his successor. She is, after all, but a girl. So, Koro must select another heir apparent from the community after weeding out the teenage, male candidates. Pai is crushed; she loves her grandfather, and feels she must make up for the loss of her brother. Besides, she knows she's up to the job.<br />I liked WHALE RIDER - up to a point. It incorporates so many of those social and personal struggles that make a good touchy-feely tear jerker: generation gap (Koro vs. Porourangi), gender bias (Koro vs. Pai), and coming-of-age (Pai vs. herself). Paratene as Koro is alternately likable and hateful as the amiable grandfather/stern traditionalist who doesn't have a clue. Haughton is a most pleasant surprise as Nanny Flowers, Pai's ally and Koro's chief critic. As Nanny puts it to her husband one night during a period of domestic tension, he may be the boss outside, but in their home she's in charge (and he'd better not forget it!). Castle-Hughes is winning as the plucky Pai.<br />I won't award five stars because I left the screening feeling overtly manipulated. Whales have a significant part in this film, and indeed catalyze the outcome of Pai's struggle for recognition. And everybody is supposed think whales warm and cuddly, right? Also, the film's focus on a society so different from that of American audiences will perhaps arouse in the viewers a self-satisfying sense of politically correct, cultural sensitivity. I've had it up to here with the concept of political correctness. And the circumstances of Pai's triumph transcended plausible reality just a wee bit.<br />Finally, I was left fidgety with the nagging feeling that the Maori teenage boys being tutored by Koro would have been better off learning, say, computer skills, rather than traditional chants or how to fight with big sticks. At the end of the day, successfully recovering the chief's whale's-tooth amulet from the sea bottom is unlikely to get you off the reservation, so to speak. Indeed, the only major character who's coping with the larger world, Porourangi, comes across as diminished by the attempt.

B0000041Q3|5.0|This is one of the best selling opera recording of our time. The three principles are the biggest superstars in opera. Since it's generally universally regarded that Pavarotti and Caballe are the best in their roles, I'll concentrate on Joan Sutherland here. Whom although a vast majority of opera fans  agreed was brilliant here,  a tiny minority but vocal  Nilsson fans feel that the Swedish Wagnerian soprano was the ideal Turandot. Let me tell you why I think Sutherland is a better Principessa of Ice than Birgit Nilsson.<br />There are those who criticize Joan Sutherland for having the lack of size for the formidible role of Turandot. The truth is, she was originally trained to be a Wagnerian dramatic soprano. In the middle 1950's She could have sang Brunhilda  if she chose to. In fact, she did sing Eva in Wagner's Meistersinger with great success early in her career. The quality of her high notes are legendary. If you were in the audience of a 1961 Lucia with Sutherland at the Met, her high E flats were rockets that almost blew up the place. They were the among the largest high notes I've ever heard. As an old timer opera fan, I can honestly tell you Sutherland's highest  notes from her youth were even larger than Nilsson's, especially the notes above high C. And that's from a fan who's heard them both numerous times. However, her midrange was never as strong as the Swedish diva. And her lower range can't be compare to Nilsson's. But remember, the recording studio can even that up.<br />True, in this Turandot, Sutherland is 10 years older than when I first heard her as Lucia in 1961. This recording is 1971. The diva's voice is much darker, and her upper register has lost some of it's power. This to be compare to Nilsson's 1960 recording is nonsense. Of course Nilsson had more power in 1960 than Sutherland in 1971, but what's the point? Both have more than enough juice to sing the confused princess. And whoever said that Sutherland's voice sounded anemic next to Nilsson has never heard the two divas on an actual operatic stage. <br />Different voices... Nilsson's voice is like a rocket roaring toward its listener while  Sutherland is like a gigantic wall of sound that surrounds you like a blanket. You cannot say that when large volumes are needed, Sutherland cannot deliver them. I've  heard her soar over the gigantic choruses in Beatrice di Tenda, holding a high E for 12 seconds! That note still rings in my ears. <br />Believe me, the high tessitura of Turandot is not a problem for Sutherland's voice. Remember, she is the only soprano in the world to sing Esclamonde - a role that demands high Ds, Es, and a high G. Esclamonde also required a full 120 piece Wagnerian size orchestra (think Gotterdamerung).And Sutherland does trills and staccato above the brass section! LIVE on the SF stage in 1974, I was in the audience. Her voice was titanic, especially the high Ds.<br />As Turandot, Sutherland did not attack every note with shere power as Nilsson did. The role did not required that every note be sung that way. Sutherland only launch her massive high notes when they were called for. In the moments that called for softer notes, she can deliver them with great beauty. Because she sung Turandot with a wide range of  dynamics makes her superior to Nilsson's, who belting her Turandot. Having said that, Birgit Nilsson was argueably the greatest Wagnerian dramatic soprano of the last century, edging out even the glorious Kirsten Flagstad. But I still think in the studio, Sutherland's Turandot rules.<br />Now for some trivia. Did you know that in La Scala, the Italians did not always like Nilsson's style of belting out every single note in Turandot? Puccini wrote the role with the idea of a very complicated woman who WANT to fall in love. I believe, it fact, that Turandot was in love with Calaf at first sight. And that's the feeling I get with Sutherland's Turandot. <br />To me, and thousands of others who rave this recording as the desert island version of Puccini's great masterpiece, Sutherland sang with just enough fortissimi  AND beauty of tone to make this a powerful Turandot to beat all others.<br />The same goes for Caballe's superlative Liu that is miraculous and Pavarotti's confident and honeyed voice Calaf.<br />This is opera making at its best. And those one star reviews are obviously jealous people who probably never even heard this performance. <br />Intelligent opera lovers, I challenge you to listen to this beauty and you be the judge. <br />Nilsson or Sutherland? I say Sutherland.

Her pipes are unmatched.Keep on keeping on...don't stop..The Best Is yet to come.I bought the CD after I saw the movie &quot;The Bodyguard.&quot; and for the last three or more years I play the CD and watch the movie over and over again. There is a message in her songs and Whitney puts all of herself into her songs...she makes them her own even when they are written by another.  She is commanding and that also comes out in her talent and God-given abilities to use that talent to be more than an entertainer.She entertains yes, but its deeper than that.  She inspires.In my profession that means much..to inspire others to seek meaning in their lives.

She manipulates Charlie, the angels, the government, and criminals (foreign and domestic) to get what she wants. The fallen angel struggles with her desire to prove that she was and will always be the best angel. She wants to be in control. Unfortunately, she ends up a bitter loner who gets her a** kicked in the end. She was really a tough byatch. It took three angels to take her out. <br />Bernie Mac, the replacement Bosley added a colorful dimension to the movie.  He played the substitute role well. It was through his character that the angels discover that their client was the bad guy.<br />The movie explores the personal relationships of the angels. What if an angel decides to marry? How long will the team be together? Why is Drew Barrymore's character attracted to evil men? Should their true profession be kept secret from their families? What if a parent is mistakenly lead to believe that his daughter is a prostitute?<br />These questions are answered in the movie. It is an entertaining feature of action and adventure. There is eye candy for males and females. Humor is interjected throughout. It's amazing how the angels escape death time after time to glamorously defeat the ultimate foe. That's the magic this movie.

B00005JLPK|5.0|Before watching this movie I had no idea who Frida was.  I knew that the film was directed by Julie Taymor (Titus), which meant that it would have a striking visual style.  I knew that the movie starred Salma Hayek and that she had wanted to play this role for years.  I knew that it had been nominated for 6 Academy Awards including a Best Actress nomination for Hayek.  But I did not know anything about the subject of the film.<br />Frida is a biopic focusing on the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek).  As much as the movie focuses on the life of Frida, it seemed that the main thrust of picture was on Frida's relationship with her husband, painter Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina).  The film does cover Frida's life from her childhood right up to her death.  We begin the movie when Frida is a young woman aspiring to be a painter.  Her father is highly supportive of her dreams.  However, she is riding on a trolley one day when it gets into an accident.  She has to be in a body cast for some time and it was in doubt whether she would ever walk again.  She recovers, but she lives a life of pain.  Frida meets the womanizing painter, Diego Rivera and they get married.  This does not mean that he changes his ways and naturally this causes problems in their marriage.  They remain committed to each other even when they are each sleeping with other people.  Over the course of the movie we see Frida painting, but it seems that Frida the artist gets pushed to the side and we see Frida the woman/wife.  I don't know enough about Frida Kahlo to know if this is a flaw in the movie or not, but it is just the way the movie is.<br />The acting in this movie is superb.  Nothing feels wrong or forced.  But, surpassing even the excellent acting is the visual presentation of Frida.  Her artwork appears throughout the movie, but not simply as paintings hanging on the wall.  Kahlo's artwork appears first as a painting, but that painting transforms into the scene itself.  This also works the opposite way in that a scene will end up as a painting and the transitions between the two are so smooth it is very impressive.<br />I was very impressed with Frida.  I didn't care for Julie Taymos's other film (Titus), so I didn't know what to expect.  Everyone (Hayek, Taymor) exceeded my expectations for the movie.  This was a very good movie.o works the opposite way in that a scene will end up as a painting and the transitions between the two are so smooth it is very impressive. <br />I was very impressed with Frida.

They deal with various aspects of the universe and some interact directly with the two movies.  As the films are each made by different directors/animation houses, they all have different looks and feels to them.  Each film is about 10 minutes long.  Naturally, some are better than others.<br />Final Flight of the Osiris:  This one is referenced near the beginning of the Matrix Reloaded.  This film has the crew of the Osiris discovering the Sentinel army drilling down to Zion.  Considering the title, we know what happens to the ship, but this is one of the better films of the bunch.  The animation was done by Square (the makers of the Final Fantasy movie) and it surpasses their previous work.  The CGI is so well done that at times you can forget that this is not real.<br />The Second Renaissance Parts I and II: These two films are connected.  These films are a prehistory to the Matrix.  We see how machines came into power and the war against Man and Machine.  In the Matrix we are told that man blotted out the sun.  In Part II we see how this is done.  This is essential viewing as it is the history document of the Matrix.  This is the how and the why the machines came to power and through it we see things that perhaps could have been done differently.  If only.<br />Kid's Story:  I didn't think this was that great of a short film, but it connects directly into the Matrix Reloaded.

This is the story of that character and how he was freed from the Matrix.  I found this one interesting because of the connection to the movie, but that is the only reason.  This features the guest voices of Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss.<br />Program:  Most of this film is fight sequences between two people in what feels like a training program.  The man is trying to convince the woman that she needs to forget about the Matrix and the real world because while they wanted to know the truth, it would be better to live an artificial life in ignorance.  I liked some of the ideas of this film, but the presentation was somewhat lacking.<br />World Record:  I'll admit that I'm a geek for track and field.  This one features an athlete who broke the world record in the 100 meters in the prelims and wants to shatter his own record so that it will never be touched.  He also becomes someone who is unknowingly able to affect the Matrix (thus the world record).  It features slow motion action for the track portion as well as flashbacks of how he got to that point.  Interesting for me, but I'm not sure about anyone else.<br />Beyond: Beyond did not connect as well as some of the films to the Matrix, but it is probably going to become a favorite.  Beyond follows a young woman who lost her cat.  She (and several children) discover a \\"haunted\\" house where weird things happen.  Gravity and other laws of physics are able to be circumvented without any of the control that someone manipulating the Matrix would need.  A sweet little story.<br />A Detective Story: This is my favorite short film of the bunch.  This is done in black and white and is a classic detective story (like one would find in the stories of Marlowe).  The dectective (truly a stereotype character) is contacted to try to find a hacker named Trinity (yes, that Trinity).  It is a sweet little story and is visually impressive.  Features the guest voice of Carrie Anne Moss.<br />Matriculated: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  It did not make any sense to me.  It was the story of humans capturing a machine, hooking it up to the Matrix and trying to convert it to the cause of humanity.  Throughout the film there was a lot of strange visuals that reminded me of an Isaac Asimov story without any of the depth or plotting.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is very good, but Almost Famous Untitled - The Bootleg Cut (Director's Edition) has extra material that fills in the gaps that add so much more to the story.  I recommend that you don't pass it up if you can find it.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Be warned - this review is more about the relationship between the movie and the story and less about the movie itself.<br />I grew up with LOTR.  It was read to me as a bedtime story as a child and was re-read every couple of years since.  When hiking in forest or mountain, I amused myself by wondering if this is what Fangorn Forest, Emyn Muil or Mordor looked like and wondered if it was the wind moving the trees or if perhaps they were moving on their own.  I felt the age-old wisdom of the Ents, the pride of dwarves through Gimli, Aragorn's self-doubt and conflicts, and Faramir's nobility when over-coming the temptation of the Ring.  I named my first born Aragorn.  <br />I understood why Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest and much of the preamble had to go in The Fellowship of the Ring.  The teeter-totter staircase in the Mines of Moria was not needed, but forgiven by perfectly imagined Balrog.  The first movie stayed very close to the spirit of the book if not the story.<br />What I do not understand is why Peter Jackson felt it necessary to diverge so much from the spirit of the story in the Two Towers.  Why was it necessary to present Merry and Pippin as having changed the minds of the Ents when in the book the Ents arrive at the need to attack Isengard on their own?  Why present the Ents as jerky stick men?  Why needlessly have Faramir bring Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath instead of letting them go earlier on and thus presenting Faramir as a far more noble.  Why have Legolas and Gimli be some Middle-Earth version of Laurel and Hardy?  One giggle in The Fellowship was enough - the antics they put Gimli through in the Two Towers are completely unnecessary.<br />However - the scenes of Gollum's internal debate, the battle at Helm's Deep, the interaction between Theoden, Grima (Wormtongue) and Gandalf in Meduseld and Sam, Frodo and Gollum's walk through the Dead Marshes to the Gates of Mordor were awesome.  The scenes of mothers sending their very young sons off to battle at Helm's Deep were immensely powerful.  We even got see the caves of Helm's Deep to which Tolkien alluded but never described.<br />I wonder what else will be dropped or changed in Return of the King?  Will Aragorn travel the Paths of the Dead?  Will it be Eowyn who slays the Nazgul or is it Merry who becomes the hero?  Will Shelob look as bad as the Ents?<br />This movie could have been, should have been great, as it is, it's merely good.
B000069HZP|5.0|I can't begin to tell you what ot expect in this movie. Wow
B00005V9HA|5.0|Some may call it campy, and some may call it a waste of time.  I call it absolutely brilliant!<br />Re-animator is possibly the best horror/comedy film ever produced.  Filled with all the makings of a popular feature...blood, guts, sex, corpse chases, dead cats, it's no wonder that this film has become a cult classic.  It is phenomenally written, being cleverly \\"in your face\\" and \\"behind your back\\" at the same time.  If you're even considering buying this, you most likely know the plot and general happenings, so why should I waste your time bending your ear over it?  Suffice it to say, this movie has something for everyone, from the die-hard horror fan, to the connoisseur of fine satire.<br />The DVD is an absolutely fantastic package, and well worth whatever you pay for it.  Disc 1 contains the feature, remastered from the original, with a new and greatly improved soundtrack, resulting in a far superior presentation to the previously released VHS version (and to tell you the truth, better than a Laser-disc edition that I saw many years ago as well!).  Disc 2 is filled (yes, the entire disc) with interviews, outtakes, extra scenes, and special features far too numerous to be listed here.  We can only hope that when \\"Bride of Re-animator\\" is re-released later this year, that it receives the same consideration that the original did.<br />Being on so many \\"must have\\" lists must mean something, and I can personally tell you that you can't go wrong by adding this classic to your collection.  Probably not a good idea to let your kids watch this one, but if you really want to scare your cat...
B000099T2L|5.0|I absolutely love Beyonce's voice and this CD definitely showcases it! <br />I don't know why people recommended Hotel Paper over Dangerously In Love. The 2 CDs can't be compared, because they are 2 different genres: Hotel Paper (pop/rock) and Dangerously In Love (r&amp;b/hip-hop) <br />If you're looking for a singer who can actually sing soulfully, and not sing folk/pop/rock music, Dangerously In Love is what you're looking for :-)
B00008I8IF|3.0|While the music on this release may be the Jayhawks best since Hollywood Town Hall the distortion on the vocals ruin it for me. My stereo system is very revealing thus exposing every wart. I have seen this distortion problem mentioned at other web sites so it seems I'm not the only one having a problem. I believe the engineers/producers turned up the levels on the vocals to the point of distortion. This vocal distortion is not a first for American Recordings as I also had the same problem with a Red Devils release.
B000002HMH|3.0|Its not a bad album. The songs are pretty good...but what happened to metallica? I loved the kicking speedy guitar riffs and Lars Ulrich's amazing drumming. None of that is really present in this album. The drumming could have been done by any drummer, and the music had a far more poppy, post grungey feeling to it. Its not metal. A band with the name metallica should be a metal band. Thats how I feel.
B00005JKED|5.0|I'm not gonna run my fingers over the keyboard like everyone else trying to write an essay for college, I would'nt really even call this a review. The Academy Award nominated 'Training Day' is a terrific film using the remarkeable dramatic acting talents of both Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. It also takes the bar and raises it on gripping content in the dangerous world of police work, in this case narcotics in one of the most dangerous gang regions of the country. Taking place over a 24 hour period, decorated officer Alonso Harris molds and shapes a young, fresh-out-of-academy rookie beat cop (Hawke) into his idea of the LA narcotics officer that will get the job done right. Ethan Hawke slowely learns how rough of an edge the job has, where normal rules of Community Oriented Policing don't apply. In a powerfull scene during a raid of a drug kingpin's home, the line we're all so familiar with between what rules movie cops break and what lenghts are not gone to or discussed..is drawn what has to be the last possible time. I don't think anything done in the future with this kind of film or TV show could put a more surprising and shocking turn of events on police misconduct. Officer Harris' young trainee learns a new and untold meaning to 'Justifiable Homicide', what goes on behind closed doors of well-respected politicians and the cost of actually making the narcotics department work in this day and age...a cost that never makes the news quite the way it happens. I've read so many reviews from these four-eyed computer geek people who will sit here all day with their chocolate milk and tear the plot apart, complaining they 'don't understand why' this and they 'don't understand how' that...For instance the final confrontation in the film before Hawke hunts for his training officer, when Alonzo leaves for dead his trainee with the hispanic drug higher-ups. Not to give anything away, but if you listened to all the dialogue following the raid on Roger..when Denzel canbe heard saying \\"Make sure that bathtubs' clean ya hear?\\", you can piece together the plot as Alonzo, knowing the family to the young girl rookie Hawke saves from rape on the street, would know that Hawke would explain to the girl's cousin how he saved her in order to save his own life...I mean the movie IS called 'TRAINING Day'. The film produces incredibly well-done performances by both stars and supporting cast, and this could possibly be the LAST great police drama that sets you on the edge of your seat and makes you compare in your head the lies, crimes and daily events of law enforcement within the story to news and real events of police drama on the streets in this country. It holds it's ground, does'nt attempt to make anything seem more comforting to the viewers, and ends on a small audio note SO appropriate to the entire film it almost makes me cry its' so good.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I like that this movie doesn't really seem to have an agenda to push.  There are many complex themes that are dealt with, but at no point does the film try to say that one way is necessarily the right way.  Yes, it makes it's point very well that killing and/or enslaving people is wrong.  But beyond that, what surprised me is that it takes such a non-judgemental viewpoint of the work of missionaries.  I really appreciated that.<br />In other words, since I'm probably not organizing my thoughts very well, this movie deals with heavy issues but ultimately lets the viewer come to his/her own conclusions.<br />The performances from Jeremy Irons and DeNiro are first class.  If Irons shines brightest, I'd say it's because he has much more screentime and the script gave him a bit more to work with.  But I won't take anything away from DeNiro, this is a really different type of role for him and he is very affective.<br />I could go on, but I think this is a movie that really just needs to be experienced.  And don't be put off by the time period.  I'm not wild about period pieces, generally speaking, but I was engrossed in this movie right from the first scene to the last.  There are some truly unforgettable moments.<br />While I haven't listened to the director's commentary or viewed the documentary (yet), I will say that this is one awesome looking dvd.  Before checking out the dvd, I had seen the movie years ago on a pan-and-scan VHS rental.  I had heard so much praise for the cinematography and you'd never tell why from a tape.  Now I see why the first thing people often praise is the photography, it's outstanding.

B00009V7T2|5.0|When Cedrick and Omar left At The Drive-In at the brink of stardom many people thought they had lost their minds. At the Drive-In had achieved a rare combination of commercial and critical success and several music publications had pegged them as the next Nirvana. Nevertheless Cedrick and Omar knew they could never create the music they desired to create in that setting. After breaking up ATDI they assembled a cast of supermusicians and consolidated under the name The Mars Volta. Their debut album Deloused in the Comatorium attests to the power of their creative vision. A stunning fusion of Post-Hardcore, Prog-Rock, Free-Jazz, Classic Rock, and Salsa; it could be the most revolutionary rock album since Radiohead's Ok Computer. The visceral energy and creative songwriting of ATDI remain, however the standard Post-Hardcore backdrop has been replaced with a style all their own. The emotional and intelligent themes of their past work also remain. The entire album is a tribute the the late Julio Venegas, a close friend of the band who commited suicide in 1996. It is a fictional account of the visions he possibly experienced in a coma following a failed suicide attempt, however the lyrics are often abstract and it is possible to derive your own meaning from them. This is a must-buy for any fan of quality music.
B00001QEBQ|3.0|This is a story that the whole family liked and we watched it several times, but then interest waned.  My little ones will go through phases of watching a new disney movie to dead, then it wanes to &quot;periodic&quot;.  This one was never an obsession for anyone in the family, not has anyone asked to see it lately.<br />I thought the problems might be the medium coloring, but they watch the &quot;power puff girls&quot;, and disneys worst isn't ever close to being that bad.  I also didn't care for the digtal imaging job that was done... almost as if it was rushed.  I thought the action was good and the characters interesting, so I think it was the music.  The music here is mediocre to bad.  The music can make a big difference.  What would the Hunchback of Notre Dame be without that wonderful music!
B000002UAX|4.0|Well, alright...no, not all of the songs are good, and some aren't even songs.  The ones that are songs tend to be very, very good, although some of those tend to suffer from the Beatle tendency to put nonsense lyrics in songs.  I have always believed they did that to (1) make people think they were putting is something deep, and (2) because they couldn't think of anything else that sounded good.  In a way, (2) is the most satisfying because only the Beatles got away routinely with the use of lyrics that make absolutely no sense.  But, like Shakespeare, they wrote in language that is so in tune with the way we all think (or thought, since this album came out so many years ago) that the songs are almost guaranteed to be easily memorable and therefore hits.  And that is part of the magic of this album...no matter what songs you pick as favorites, or which ones you pan as ridiculous, the power of the Beatles as songwriters that play right into the way you talk and think is unmistakeable.  However, there is a lot of stuff on this album that nobody but the Beatles could include and have everyone think of as high art.  Everyone thinks the Beatles burned all kinds of artistic midnight oil tweaking numerous meaningful details, including all kinds of twisty clues to this and that.  OK...probably on some things, but going overboard with that kind of thing has helped make mountains out of &quot;songs&quot; on this album that are really molehills.  And, it has made songs that are pure fun, and were meant only for that, to be examined and found philosophically wanting by people that look for those hidden meaings.  To conclude, the Beatles emptied their attic on this album.  Like any collection of stuff from an attic, some of it very interesting and some of it is simply to be thrown away.  Having said that, though, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and this album has found beauty in lots and lots of eyes.  It really is a hoot to listen to, and it really really is a great collection from the 20th century's most influential rock band.  You won't regret going through this collection of attic rummage and finding what you like, because you will find things that you like, and like a lot.
0316666343|1.0|I read this book rather reluctantly. My roomate gave it to me months ago and I had no intention of reading it, but curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to know if it was really as good as everyone was making it out to be. Needless to say, I was let down. It did not hold my interest and I ended up skimming through many parts of the book. The last two chapters were so corny and far fetched it was almost laughable. <br />It wasn't the subject matter that bothered me. The story lacked a sense of cohesiveness. It was very disjointed and I felt that most of the characters were poorly devloped and not very believable. I don't understand why the literary world has placed so much esteem on this book. Does the author have friends in high places? That is the only explanation I can come up with. If you are looking for a page-turner (with a satisfying ending) try A Thousand Acres by Jane Smiley or White Oleander by Janet Fitch.
B00004W50T|5.0|When \\"...Big Pink\\" came out in 1968 I was 21 years old, in the Navy, and a long way from home.  I had just learned that the music which spoke to me so strongly, but was heard on the radio so rarely, was called Blues.  I don't know which cut I heard first -- probably The Weight -- but whatever it was spoke to me as clearly as Sonny Boy Williamson and Eric Clapton.  A thread which was woven through the psychedelic era was a wish by young adults to get back to the land, to eschew the suburban life in which we'd been reared and return to self-reliance and uncomplicated values. The Band let us return in our hearts to somewhere we'd never been, and Music From Big Pink will forever be one of the seminal albums of the Baby Boom's lives.  The wonderful thing about it is that it holds up, does not go out of date.  It is musical literature, and will never die.

It passes the \\"Repeat Viewing\\" test, becuase the second time we watched, the kids actually stayed in the room and watched.  I has expected this to be a femanist manufesto movie, but we are never lectured to or preached to.  What we have is a story about a smart, pretty california girl, destined to be a beauty queen, who chases her boy friend to Harvard Law.  The message here is that hard work has its rewards for men and women and it is wrapped up in a fun to watch package.  PS.  check out the sound track...  it has some good music on it that my 6 and 10 year daughters liked.  There is no nudity, no simulated sex and the language is acceptable, so this is safe for younger viewers.

It took me to a different place like no other artist ... well except for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. <br />They are not a &quot;band&quot; but really something else that is completely undescribable.  Their album is worth every penny, dime, quarter and then some.  Buy it and hopefully you'll love it as much as I do.

B00005B4GD|5.0|At long last, the Brothers Gibb have crafted an album that surpasses all their earlier efforts. The sound is more basic (less synthesizer) and more mature (simplifying all their talents). The range is varied, but always maintains an upbeat, rock filled tempo. &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; and &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; are amazing surprises of excellent R &amp; B rock. Is this the Bee Gees? Even the ballads are mainstream upbeat, such as, &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;Embrace&quot; and the oddly named, &quot;Loose Talk, Costs Lives&quot;. Although, the title track has been chosen as the first single (in the rest of the World), any track could make it, (save for &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, which is a pleasant, but odd novelty song). Maurice even tops himself with the Beach Boys styled &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot;. There are lots of surprises here and there is absolutely no way to try and pick which songs will be chosen for air-play. They are all that good.  It doesn't hurt to go out of the way to get the extra songs on this package, such as the lovely ballad, &quot;Just In Case&quot; and the power song, &quot;Promise The Earth&quot;.

B00005A46T|1.0|Talk about disapointing. Every song has the same guitar riffs, the same self-pitying outlook, and the same curse word (yes, it starts with an F.) The recurring theme of rejection and suicide in Slipknot's music is played out before the CD is even half way done. Struggling to rhyme, the band falls back on elementary rhyme schemes that fail to convey anything besides a sort of adolescent rage.  Occasionally the boys throw in some big words in an attempt to enrich their music, but this only makes them look worse. The same lines have an unpleasant tendancy to reappear throughout the songs; I only know that because the band included the lyrics in their CD cover. Otherwise I might have been able to half-way appreciate the garbled, poorly delivered screaming that seems to be their signature.<br /> Looks like the bandmembers were too busy to delve into anything besides their foundation and fake blood.  They summed themselves up in EVERYTHING ENDS with the line \\"You are wrong, f*cked, and overrated.\\" If you want to buy a quality CD in this genre, check out Manson.

Although, the title track has been chosen as the first single (in the rest of the World), any track could make it, (save for &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, which is a pleasant, but odd novelty song). Maurice even tops himself with the Beach Boys styled &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot;. There are lots of surprises here and there is absolutely no way to try and pick which songs will be chosen for air-play. They are all that good. It doesn't hurt to go out of the way to get the extra songs on this package, such as the lovely ballad, &quot;Just In Case&quot; and the power song, &quot;Promise The Earth&quot;.
B000002U82|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite albums.<BR>you can play this disk as the soundtrack for alice in wonderland. all you do is turn on alice in wonderland but mute the sound and begin playing the dark side of the moon disc when the lion in the begining of the movie roars for the third time. if you did it right the movie and cd will be in sync. all the emotions and effects will match
0792842499|5.0|First, this is my second favorite film of all time! Second, it has the best soundtrack ever. Third, it's non-stop entertainment. It is VERY well directed, and Sergio Leone comes very close to Akira Kurosawa at directing. Clint Eastwood is spectacular, and so is Eli Wallach. The plot unfolds itself wonderfully, and introduces the characters. It even has a civil war mood to the story! This is the greatest Western of all time, just remember that.
B00005JLYU|1.0|This is Hollywoods attempt to make a Summer Blockbuster that will appeal to women and men (\\"boys, we gotta make a film for da broads too..\\"). I cringe whenever I hear Hoochie #1: Cameron Diaz, talk about this dreck and \\"positive female roles\\" in the same sentence. What a mess.<br /> First off, lets not forget the golden rule: Lucy Lui = Bad Movie, so you have already been warned.<br />Then there's the \\"action\\" scenes: just plain pathetic, really sad. \\"Fun\\" it is not.<br />Sure, there is plenty of scenes of the three \\"actresses\\" bumping and grinding while wearing fetish gear or next to nothing, but so what. Pornos have better plots and acting. <br /> If you really want to see these hoochies prance around, spare yourself the pain of listening to the insipid dialog and bad acting and rent the film later this year. Then you can fast forward through the dull parts.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Ok the reason that i gave Linkin Park new album \\"Meteora\\" a two was, first the album is around 36 minutes, second the album is not real rock like \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\", Or \\"Nirvana\\"  which are true rock groups. What I mean by they are not a real rock group is that they are produced for radio, and not produced by the indy seen .  The only true good song on the album is faint, which is about 2:45 minutes long, which is not enough for me, because im used to album being at least 60 minutes long not 36 minutes.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR CASH ON A CD WORTH BUYING MAYBE LIKE RADIOHEAD !!!!!!
B0000025JT|5.0|This album is one in a series of Bee Gees productions. Previously the Bee Gees composed and produced for their late brother Andy Gibb. No,Barry Gibb is not intruding in the photos contained in the album although his name does not appear on the cover or the label. He's only Barbra Streisand's producer for the GUILTY album. Two songs were written by all three Bee Gees. They are the title track and WOMAN IN LOVE. Between GUILTY,Dionne Warwick's HEARTBREAKER album and Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album,this one had the biggest sales record to date. It still sells well after its release 23 years ago. Barry has writing credit for all nine songs(some of them were written without the other Bee Gees). The Bee Gees later recorded GUILTY for their ONE NIGHT ONLY concert in 1997.
B00005QK3W|4.0|As a big fan of The Beatles and of Paul's early solo stuff, I must admit that it's been twenty years since I've bought anything Paul has done. The `80's and `90's were a LONG dry spell.<br />\\"Flaming Pie\\" and now, \\"Driving Rain\\". Paul is BACK!<br />Driving Rain, like The Beatles' White Album, is a sprawling (16 tracks!) musical collage, but with a distinct, sometimes barely perceptible (sometimes noticeably so), undercurrent of darkness...\\"edginess\\". Both albums attempt to cover a lot of ground, both suffer from an occasional misstep, both have shining successes despite their lack of \\"Top 40\\" material, and both are somewhat polarizing to fans. The White Album and Driving Rain. You either love `em or you hate `em.<br />I love Driving Rain.<br />The opening track \\"Lonely Road\\" sets the tone immediately. Melancholy lyrics, gritty guitars, and a gravelly vocal serves notice that Paul intends to ROCK on this CD, thank you very much.<br />\\"From a Lover to a Friend\\" is Paul's obvious attempt at a radio-friendly tune. It begins promisingly enough, but Paul's voice thins as he hits the high notes and the \\"oooo-la-la-la's\\" are a put off.<br />\\"She's Given Up Talking\\" seems to have taken a lot of flak from other reviewers, mostly, I guess, because the lyrics are something less than \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". I'm sorry, but Paul's thumping fuzz bass and a guitar solo that had me convinced that Pink Floyd's David Gilmour was sitting in make this a very strong track indeed. Unlike anything else in Macca's catalog.<br />\\"Driving Rain\\", again, seems to be a favorite song to pick on by some of the reviewers in the crowd because they feel Paul's opening verse, \\"1-2-3-4-5/Let's go for a drive!\\" is, I dunno, \\"unworthy\\". Are they even LISTENING to Paul's melodious bass perfectly looping in and around the punchy staccato drum/rhythm guitar combo? Pop craftsmanship at its best. <br />\\"I Do\\" is very nice, but in my opinion suffers from just a tad bit too much over-production. Streamline the orchestra, and it sounds like it's right off of Rubber Soul.<br />\\"Tiny Bubble\\" has a Motown feel that morphs into a signature Paul sing-a-long. Nice ditty but nothing earthshaking.<br />\\"Magic\\" falls a bit short to my ears. Generic melody, uninspired lyrics. Saved somewhat by Beatle-like false ending and drum solo fade out reminiscent of \\"Strawberry Fields\\".<br />\\"Your Way\\" is yet another showcase for Paul's wonderful ability to marry bass and guitar into a very simple, yet very enjoyable little country tune. Think of  Ram's \\"Heart of the Country\\" or Red Rose Speedway's  \\"One More Kiss\\".<br />\\"Spinning on an Axis\\" never really gets going. Paul's \\"rap\\" makes me cringe.<br />\\"About You\\" is quite possibly my favorite. WOW! Straight ahead power pop/blues that jumps right in and takes no prisoners. The bass! The vocal! The DRUMMING! WOW! Did I say WOW? Could find a home on White Album/Let it Be/Abbey Road. WOW!<br />\\"Heather\\" is an almost completely instrumental piano track named for Paul's new wife. The story goes, he was playing the tune at home when Heather asked, \\"Which Beatle song is that?\\" Very nice melody. I love the line that Paul eventually sings, \\"There I will stay/for a year and a day\\". I'm not sure why, other than it sounds like just the kind of whimsy we all loved from the \\"old\\" (or is it \\"young\\"?) Paul.<br />\\"Back in the Sunshine Again\\", in my opinion, is actually Paul's tribute to George (not the sitar-tinged \\"Riding Into Jaipur\\"). A bluesy number with George-like slide guitar work throughout. Another rather gritty offering that is not at all \\"sunshiney\\". A favorite.<br />\\"Your Loving Flame\\". Ugh. It's the return of `80's Paul! This is why I stopped buying! Syrupy Muzak with little if any redeeming value. Skip.<br />\\"Riding Into Jaipur\\". I didn't much care for The Beatles' Indian influenced tunes, and I still don't care for them now. Points for trying, I guess, but \\"Back in the Sunshine\\" sounds to me like much more of a \\"George\\" song than this does.<br />\\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" has very strong echoes of Abbey Road's \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\". I LOVE this song! Again, WOW! A ten minute jam with tons of little Beatle flourishes: primal scream, backward guitar, harpsichord and cello combo. A delicious treat. Can you see any of Paul's contemporaries (Eric Clapton, Elton John, Mick Jagger, etc.) recording anything like this? No way in hell! Would have been the absolutely perfect ending to the album except...<br />...\\"Freedom\\" got slapped on at the last minute in response to 9/11. Oh, it's an OK song I guess, but after the utter bliss of \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\", I never let this track come on to spoil the mood.<br />Paul has produced back-to-back superb efforts for the first time since \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Venus and Mars\\". Can he hit the trifecta with his next record? For the first time in a long time, he's got momentum!
B00000DS2K|3.0|Its catchy, it pop, ITS NOT OZZY that we know and love.<br />If you want catchy hair band metal, then get it it.  otherwise, save your money, and buy ANY ozzy-era sabbath album
B00009V7T2|5.0|If you like at the drive in then buy this album. I enjoyed the whole album not just a few of the songs. The music is something different to the indie/emo sound than what people have heard in the past.I really enjoyed listening to At The Drive-In, and was shocked when they split up. Their sound was unique and was not compared to anything except now through THE MARS VOLTA. With a new band there is a new sound. The Lyrics stick in your head with  Cedric, and if they don't then the music will. It is something new that other bands will have a hard time trying to sound like. But that is why THE MARS VOLTA is so good, the have their own sound which is in itself art. BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WON&quot;T REGRET IT!
B00005JMC6|5.0|Plain and simple, I could not possibly rate this movie higher.  Sad and troublesome until the end, but then a powerful and wonderful happy ending.  If you're female, you'll be furious throughout most of the movie, but love the ending.
B000002BYD|5.0|On Yield, Pearl Jam's 5th album, the band abandons much of the experimental nature of the preceding two albums (No Code and Vitalogy) and offers up a strong batch of classic rock tunes.  The band is older and wiser, not afraid to let loose and rock out.  This attitude creates an album that feels very organic and rich.  Eddie's vocals are in top form and the guitar interplay between Stone Gossard and Mike McCready reaches a whole new level of excellence.  Yield truly is a band effort and it shows.  <br />\\"Brain of J\\" is one of Pearl Jam's greatest album openers; it opens the album on a VERY energetic note and the lyrics are based on some very interesting subject matter.  Following \\"Brain of J\\" is another highlight in \\"Faithfull\\".  The song starts out whisper soft and explodes into a rocking chorus, showing Pearl Jam's uncanny sense of dynamics.  The one-two punch of \\"Given to Fly\\" and \\"Wishlist\\" is one of the finest moments in Pearl Jam's history, two of their greatest songs one after the other.  \\"Low Light\\"  is a great acoustic ballad with tons of emotion; for some reason Pearl Jam neglects to play this great song live.  \\"In Hiding\\" is Yield's last excellent song, perhaps the best song on the album:  a very classic rock, Neil Young reminiscent song with a vocal melody to die for.  The rest of the songs range from decent (\\"Push Me Pull Me, \\"Red Dot\\") to great (\\"MFC\\", \\"All Those Yesterdays\\").  <br />Yield isn't \\"comeback to grunge CD\\" that fans of Ten and Vs. have been wishing for, but rather a showcase for a band that experimented, took what they learned, and injected it into their current sound.  This album is an absolute must-have if you are a fan of Pearl Jam's previous efforts, especially No Code.  If you are looking to get into Pearl Jam you should definitely start with Ten and Vs.  As it stands, Yield is another high quality offering from the best band of the 90's.
B000099T2L|5.0|Finally the album I have waited ever since finding out she would release a solo album. This didnt past my expectations but didnt disappoint me. On track 7 8 around there. I think she really sounded or had a tweet sound to her it was okay but the track I really enjoy are crazy in love,Naughty girl which is my personal fave and be with you hip hop star is growing on me. I love all the tracks except maybe The real slow ones because she didnt really sound like herself she kinda reached but I love the album You knocked em out bey!
B00004Z4WR|1.0|This is typical Jerry Bruckheimer action movie fare - see Days of Thunder Pearl Harbor etc.<br />Like the others you are trated to an opening few mintes of car action, followed by 90 minutes of actors shuffling around with not much muttering something about i gotta do this for my \\"brudder\\" and then a final fairly decent car chase.  The thing is - unlike the original which is a much better and honest movie done on a show string budget, this one hypes with the promis of exotic cars at speand.  Ferraris, Jaguars, Lambos etc.  Know how fast you get to see a Lambo going? About 3mph as it backs up down a driveway.  Know how fast you see the Jaguar 220 go? Who knows it looks like it was pushed into the camera fram by extras on the set - I don't even think the motor was running.  Ferraris?  the only time you see them is when the theifs enter a ware house - you never actullay see them driven. You never get to see any of the exotic cars driven.  What you do see is a 68 mustang which is supposed to be a Shelby Mustang but who can tell after it was customized (butchered) for the movie.<br />Want to see real cars in action?  Le Mans with Steve McQueen, Grand Prix with James Garner, The Driver with Ryan O'Neil, The Fast and Furious, Ronin, Vanishing Point with Barry Newman, Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry with Peter Fonda, Bullitt with Steve McQueen, and last but not least the original Gone in 60 seconds, the same guy drives the car, directs the movie, produces the movie, heck I think he even wrote the music for the movie and he seriously hurt himself when he wraped the car around a street light pole - for real.  The movie was shot out of sequense so they were able to finish it. He did another low budget called The Junkman - not as good but all the stuff in it is real as well.  No computer generated effects in any of these - just real people driving real cars.
0385335482|5.0|In the summer, I love a good quick read.  This has everythign I want in a summer book.  Great plot but silly, great ending for a story, great fun for a read.  If you don't want to sift through allusions or allegories this is the book for you!
B000077VOY|5.0|Stingray is part three in the Gerry Anderson five part development (and eventual perfection) of marionette based shows. 'Supercar\\" was crude and campy good 1960 kidshow fun. \\"Fireball XL5\\" had significant improvements in technique. \\"Stingray\\" was in color and was a dramatic leap ahead in set design, marionette action, scripting, and special effects. \\"Thunderbirds\\" remains the best of the lot with hour long scripts, \\"gee whiz!\\" special effects, some funny character development (such as the humourously  irritable dialogue of the pyramid explorers in \\"The Uninvited\\"), and action scenes. Stingray is famous for its underwater special effects which were advanced for 1963-64. No one had seen anything like it up until then. Stingray has the best fully developed characters with Troy, Phones, Atlanta, and Marina. Stingray is enjoyable and highly nostalgic.
B000099T2L|5.0|Much much more than I expected. Awesome beats, lyrics,  and beautiful voice . Her talent is undeniable. Definitely a must buy.
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard coldplays single yellow on the radio and in some shows and movies, and i liked the song a lot, but never really gave thought to buying their cd. Yellow drifted from my mind and in july 2002 i heard \\"in my place\\" on the radio, and i was hooked. I downloaded the song immediately and listened to it for days. I bought a rush of blood to the head before i got parachutes, which in my opinion was a good move. A rush of blood to the head blew me away. I seriously listened to it every day for months, and never got tired of it. Every song is a masterpiece. The strong opening politik is incredible. In my place is very catchy, and an awesome song. \\"god put a smile on your face\\" is wonderful and beautiful. \\"the scientist\\" is my favorite song on the cd. Simply amazing. The song is full of emotion. Clocks and Daylight back to back are fast paced songs that will get you moving. \\"Green eyes\\", the softest song on the cd is also one of the best, and my 2nd fave. Warning sign is full of emotion and is just wonderful. Although \\"A whisper\\" is my least favorite it is still good. The title track and amsterdam are a little slow, they pick up the pace midway through. Each song has its own sound, and i love it. If youre a fan of rock...even a little, you will love this album
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard 'Bring Me To Life' on the radio, I thought it was definately a good song and an interesting twist to the current plethora of pop/rock bands out there. Gradually I came to love the song, but I was worried that Evanescence would be a band that had an album that was full of 'fillers' and a total waste of money. So I was a wimp and bought the single. 'Farther Away', and particulary 'Missing' totally blew me away, and immediately I went out and bought Fallen. After the first listen, I liked all the songs (barring 'Hello'), but there weren't that many songs that stood out. A few hours later I'm writing this review in love with the album. <br />GOING UNDER<BR>My favorite on Fallen. Belting chorus; Amy's voice is amazingly clear. I hope this will be Evanescence's next single, because I'm sure it would be a hit. I've read a lot of the reviews on here and no one dislikes Going Under. Great song. 10/10<br />BRING ME TO LIFE<BR>I won't comment on this one, I'm sure you've all heard it. But it's great. 10/10<br />EVERYBODY'S FOOL<BR>The first time I heard it I didn't like it at all, but it's one of my favorite songs now. Catchy chorus. 10/10<br />MY IMMORTAL<BR>After I heard 'Missing' on the BMTL single, I thought Evanescence's ballads would stand out on the album. But I'm not feeling this song. Maybe I'll grow into liking it. Amy's voice sure is beautiful though. 6/10<br />HAUNTED<BR>Good song, once you know the lyrics you'll undoubtedly be singing to it. Has a sort of creepy sound to it and the rocking chorus is pretty good. I definately like this song. 8/10<br />TOURNIQUET<BR>Weird song at first, a little different from the others. But after a couple of listens I've grown to really like it. 8/10<br />IMAGINARY<BR>Good, solid song. Another fast rock song. 8/10<br />TAKING OVER ME<BR>I love this song. Another one which shows just how brilliant Amy is. Catchy. 9/10<br />HELLO<BR>In my opinion, the only major flaw to the album. I realize most people like it, but to be honest I can't stand it. 4/10<br />MY LAST BREATH<BR>Solid song. It grows on you.<br />WHISPER<BR>It's ok.....the chorus is the only stand out thing here. The ending is awful, though. And it drags on forever - it's over 5 minutes long. Ok song. 7/10<br />EXCELLENT: Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, Taking Over Me<BR>VERY GOOD: Haunted, Tourniquet, Imaginary, My Last Breath<BR>DECENT: Whisper<BR>BAD: My Immortal, Hello<br />Overall, a great album and a must buy if you liked Bring Me To Life. I definately recommend it. Also get the single - Farther Away and Missing are worth the 10 bucks.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Absolutely the best chinese movie that I ever watched. Though the story was simple, it was really touching!! The most outstanding character was Miss Zhang (Di). She could act pretty well as a lovely and pretty country girl who fell in love with a city school teacher. Her beauty with her superb natural acting styles that really captured my full attentions toward her only in this movie. I watched the movie with my tears dripping.
0062502182|2.0|i agree with some of the other reviewers who have been disappointed with this book.  it was recommended to me as a life-changer.  while sweet and magical, it is the kind of book i would perhaps read to my child (if i had one) at bedtime.  it is a fairy tale.  there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself.  however, it lacks substance.  for example, it may say (and i'm paraphrasing) that \\"over time the boy learned to listen to his heart\\".  how?  what happened?  another reviewer mentioned that he never makes mistakes and this is true.  the boy always seems to have revelations at just the right time and never has to learn from mistakes, only realizes the truth before it is needed.  coelho leaves out all the meaty bits.  it almost seems like a summary of itself.  like the cliff notes for a very good book.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This must be one of Hugh Grant's best work in his career!  Besides that, this movie has many funny moments, but yet can be very touching/relating.  Most other movies I see that are about a thirty-something year old guy without a job or a steady girlfriend don't fit the storyline.  &quot;About a Boy&quot; does.  And it adds unique eyecatching moments that signify the movie.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I loved \\"Donnie Darko\\".  I saw it on a movie channel on TV a few months ago, and i absoultely loved it.  i'm into these kinds of weird, not fully advertised strange movies, so i throughly enjoyed watching it.  i mean, the way that Jake Gyllenhaal played such a different character than what i've seen him do, it was great to see the diversity.  i reccommend this movie to all the freaks of the world who don't mind a little creepiness in their lives every once in awhile.
B00009ATKS|5.0|While the anticipation of the new Mogwai album has been with me for months, the actual finished product by far exceeds my and many fans' expectations.  Some say Mogwai relies too heavily on the loud/soft dynamics present throughout Young Team and Ten Rapid as their sound.  Those days were gone with the arrival of the long and wandering CODY (until the last few tracks), My Father My King, and Rock Action.  This album is a logical continuation of the musical evoultion that Mogwai has brought us over their past few albums.<br />\\"Hunted by a Freak\\" starts low, like many Mogwai songs, and builds to a multi instrumental explosion, only to die out with the same simplicty of the intro. <br />\\"Killing all Flies\\" and \\"Ratts of the Capital\\"  are similiar to My Father My King, only compressed into five mintues of musical bliss instead of MFMK's epic 20 minutes.<br />Perhaps the most impresive songs of the album are the last two, \\"I Know You are but What am I\\" and \\"Stop Coming to my House\\"  The first begins with a simple repeating piano pattern then adds complex drum machine antics to bring an emotional release to be completed by the last song on the album.  \\"Stop Coming...\\" is the perfect finish to an album that gives emotion in restrained does and lets loose with feedback and sonic bliss. <br />This is my first review and as you can tell I am a poor writer.  <br />In short, this is an amazing album for Mogwai fans and if approached with an open mind free of \\"radio biased\\" expectations will yield much satisfaction.
0062502182|2.0|A shepherd boy named Santiago travels from his homeland Andalusia to the Pyramids of Giza to achieve his dreams (or, as the author puts it, his &quot;Personal Legend&quot;). Along the way he faces difficulties, overcomes them, and acquires the ability to speak the &quot;Language of the World&quot; (the ability to communicate with sentient beings of the world). As a modern day fable, the book possesses neither the compendious quality of R. Bach's &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; nor the warmth and imagination of Saint-Exupery's &quot;The Little Prince.&quot; The indicative mood employed by the author leaves readers with almost no space for imagination. It comes to me as a surprise that this book has been such a hit. Perhaps we are all ears when it comes to fables.
B00009RDG9|5.0|This movie kicked ... . Tracking, survival, special operations and subsequent changes in personality, are all real things. This movie teaches us alot if we pay close enough attention to it. Action packed and pieced together well. Actors were very realistic and trained well for all the scenes. Do yourselves a favor and see it...... live it.
6305132984|5.0|I won't have any original commentary to add here after more than 200 reviews. But I remember when this film ran on network television 25 years ago. After being beefed up with commercials, it had to be shown in 2 parts over two nights. I only saw it in the theater once when I was about 14, and had forgotten many  visuals which were cut off on television. So let me just say that the smartest thing MGM-UA could do is present a widescreen, 70mm DVD. It has a gorgeous restored picture (important for visual effects during the gym dance and the rumble, which saturate the screen with the color red), and pristine sound- probably the most gorgeous score ever composed by Leonard Bernstein. There are, of course, stage purists who scoff at the movie (and its many ghost singers), but I always thought the film's adaptation was superior to the stage show because it gave the story a more breathless, one-act pace. The songs \\"Cool\\" and \\"I Feel Pretty\\" are completely restaged from the original libretto, and the background score is given something of a theatrical makeover. And the dancing, of course, is peerless-- whether it's the \\"Cool\\" dance in the garage, the \\"America\\" battle of the sexes featuring the Sharks, or even the delicate rooftop solo performed by Natalie Wood- radiant and bewitching in a white dress.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is truly a collabrative effort, and it shows!  The voice of Soundgarden and the driving sound of Rage...who can ask for anything more?<br />They do mix it up quite a bit, though so this isn't just a regurgitation of old songs from either band.  There's a couple that sound like Rage, there's a couple that sound like Soundgarden, and then they surprise you with a whole new Audioslave sound that feels familiar, but gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside!<br />Get it!  You'll love it!
B00009V7T2|5.0|After hearing the Tremulant EP, I didn't think there was much else The Mars Volta could do that would be better.  But, I was corrected when I heard De-Loused.  I can't even begin to tell you how incredible this album is - it's my favorite by far.  So, order one today, you'll be glad you did.
0609610570|4.0|A big fan of Ram Charan, I was looking forward to reading Execution. I started the book twice and couldn't get through it (I suspect good intentions, but poor execution on my part.) Upon the third attempt, I made it all the way through and found the book to be extremely valuable. <br />As an HR person, I often struggle with finding reasons for the success of some people and organizations to get things done while others simply talk about things and cannot deliver results.  It is often our role to lead the leaders and to help build the capability of our people. The authors attribute much of the ability to execute to strong leadership, corporate culture, and systematic processes with regard to: people, strategy, and operations. CEO's are finally realizing that having the right talent in the first place is critical to delivering high performance results.<br />The first part of this book is cumbersome. Moving back and forth between Larry and Ram conversation was distracting, and I think that is why some didn't find the book valuable. If you move quickly through that section, you will discover the best parts of the book.<br />First, that execution happens because of a corporate culture that is steeped in discipline. That very word may make some people bristle. Larry and Ram are not talking about punitive treatment of people (a la &quot;neutron Jack&quot;), but more of consistent processes and systems that can be replicated across a culture, in strategic business units, with repeatable results. It puts responsibility where it belongs, with corporate leaders. Leaders must be authentic and hands on. Leaders must know what is going on, must hold people accountable, and must communicate on a daily basis with people at all levels.<br />I openly admit that as an HR leader, I am biased. I was delighted to read from a CEO the reality that leaders cannot hand off responsibilities such as performance management, corporate culture building, talent review, and rewards and incentives to HR. Having the right people in place is the leader's responsibility. So leaders must take an active role in those processes. Yet many of my HR counterparts struggle to get in the CEO's office to discuss these topics.<br />According to the authors, a surprising number of strategies fail because leaders are not realistic about the capability of an organization to execute against a strategic plan. It never occurs to them that the right talent may not be in place or available, or that the culture or structure may not support the necessary changes.<br />My favorite part of the book was the section on getting the right people in the right jobs. The failings of the traditional interview process, performance, and rewards systems leads to poor fit between job and leader. Using a leadership assessment summary to give an overview of those who are promotable based on predetermined success factors can give a good view of the leadership pipeline and organizational capability. <br />While written for the general business reader, Human resources professionals will be the biggest fans of Execution. I hope it leads to consistent people, strategy, and operational processes in many organizations that will undoubtedly result in building a culture that gets things done. And, I hope many CEO's will read it and take action.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I think that one of the reasons why this soundtrack and the music that it contains is so fitting for the movie is because it fits in so seamlessly that it is a part of the story. The fact that Howard Shore composed this massive score for three movies, never mind one, is absolutely astounding. I know that a lot of people have always disregarded classical music because it is BORING, or whatever, but I think that people who appreciate classical music are actually very lucky. I personally play the clarinet, so the fact is that since I actually play in bands, and have experienced how many parts go into the making of each sound you hear, I am able to notice those little things that people sometimes miss. My favorite parts are not only the huge sweeping epic triumphs that are contained within this cd, but also the background sounds, such as strings that you don't even notice at first, and that little run that just adds something, you know? This soundtrack is not just about how big and massive and extraordinary the music is, but the fact that it contains so many memorable and enchanting solos and small parts that fit together so perfectly is equally remarkable. The singing solos are absolutely amazing, too. I didn't realize that the human voice could sound so beautiful. After having to listen to what is on the radio (such as rap, hip hop, etc), I start to realize how little real talent those people have. You may be thinking that I am some grouchy old person who is against all of today's popular music, but I'm not - I'm 15. I know that I am writing this review long after the soundtrack has come out, but this soundtrack is just so amazing and powerful and moving that I had to say something. If you are considering buying this cd, by all means do so. You certainly won't regret it.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Before watching this dvd I was all in favor of its concept.  Normally, great movies rarely give the audience a chance to fully understand the background of the story, but this dvd promises to do just that.  To that it, end only marginally succeeds.<br />This dvd collects nine stories from the Matrix universe, some that directly tie into the movies, and others that do not.  This, in my mind, is where the dvd's problems arise.  The stories involving known characters and events are wonderful, but the wholly original works lack spirit and direction.  <br />I gave this dvd 3 stars because the short episodes about the war with the machines, the discovery of the digging machines, and the search for Trinity all work wonderfully, if a bit unfocused.  The downfall is in the other tales using characters with no tie to anything except the universe they are in.<br />In my opinion, this dvd would have worked much better if it had gone into more detail about the rise of AI, as well as other points the movie's only mention.  The different artistic styles only fueled the lack of focus of these stories.  Either the creators were trying to push to much info through in a short time span, or the artists took too many liberties with the script.<br />This dvd also has some interesting extras.  Insight into its creation as well as others provide a small amount of enjoyment besides the films.  These, however, are no reason to purchase the dvd if you are not a fan of the films, all of which can be seen online fairly easily.<br />All in all, this dvd is an interesting companion to the Matrix films, but it is probably best to rent instead of purchase.
B00005JLWN|2.0|This painfully predictable cliche-flick is as campy as it is moronic.  It is the kind of...science fiction that would even get cut from the Sci-Fi channel.  The plot is a rahash of Fahrenheit 451, but is done in an incoherent and inconsistent manner.  The characters make dumb decisions at every point that they are able to (but prevail anyway, of course).  The overarching theme is \\"feelings,\\" and how they make us human.  Ugh, it's like Janeway in Voyager, you just want them to shut up about the whole thing and quit trying to ram it down your throat.<br />I will give a few examples of the most egregiously ennui-enducing elements of the movie.  I won't give an exhuastive list, both because it would crash your browser.<br />The box says that there are gunbattles in this movie, but I didn't notice any.  There are a lot of scenes where people are killing other people with guns, but in NONE of the many sequences does a member of the winning side ever get touched.  Each one is a slaughter.<br />The front of the box talks about how much better this movie is than \\"The Matrix.\\"  Here's a hint:  if a movie has to resort to that claim, run the other way.  The mood, technique, and design of the film are cheap Matrix knockoffs, unoriginal in every way.<br />If the movie took itself less seriously, it might be possible to just laugh these types of things off.  With the actors looking so serious all the time, though, it just becomes hard to sit through the whole thing.  Watch at your own risk.
B000063DI9|5.0|really, folks, music doesn't get much better than this.  I can't decide if this is my favorite maiden or powerslave.  when i listen to this one, i say this is my favorite.  but when i listen to powerslave, i say that one is my favorite, tee hee. <br />this is madien's most melodic, epic, cd.  almost all the songs are epic in their scope and they also feature keyboards, the first for a maiden album I do believe.  <br />what's really cool about this cd is steve's bass.  Again, you can hear it very well and, yes, it's amazing as usual.  but this time it sounds different than on their other albums.  it sounds more..i don't know, i can't explain it.   Just check it out.<br />The guitar riffs on this cd are not very heavy as on their older stuff, they are more thin and melodic, looser sounding.  For the first time, the awesome guitar duo of smith and murray don't sound like they are taking turns killin the guitar with solos...for the first time, they are together as one, making sure everything comes out tight.<br />The vocals, drums, guitar, and bass all come together to get the same feel for each song.  You don't ahve any body singing or playing faster than the other elements, giving this album very tight musicianship.  <br />The solos are not fast and heavy but mid pace and melodic, not bother to rushing to see how many notes they can get into a bar of music but instead to pull the song together like a perfect bridge.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!
B0000262QW|5.0|&quot;Return to Forever&quot; is a marvelous album that stands in a genre all its own. Chick Corea has unassailable jazz credentials with his work in Miles' Davis experiments and his fine trio work with Roy Haynes and Miroslav Vitous. Return to Forever is a lyrical album that has beautiful melodies and strong improvisation from Joe Farrell while tastefully melding the Brazilian influences of Flora Purim and Airto Moreira. For me, it's the Brazilian influences that make this such a resounding album. Airto's samba patterns and percussive work on &quot;Return to Forever&quot; and &quot;Sometime Ago&quot; are wonderful. Joe Farrell provides some marvelous flute work on &quot;What Game Shall We Play Today&quot;. &quot;What Game&quot; is a very infectious melody that you'll want to play over and over again. Stanley Clarke's stuff is a little more restrained than some of the more rock influenced stuff Return to Forever eventually went into, but his technical chops are still a vital part of this session. Still &quot;Return to Forever&quot; highlights the best of what Chick Corea has to offer, a willingness to please, tasteful use of texture through the electric piano and music that takes risk while still being melodic and affirming. This is one of the best albums I've purchased in the last couple years.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|...but then I read benshlomo's, which I think sums things up pretty well. I don't agree with all of it -- maybe I listen to too much Pere Ubu and Captain Beefheart, but I've never thought of Dylan as not being able to sing -- but it essentially makes all the points I would've made. So go read his, and save me a half-hour.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I would like say that this was a good movie. Weird in a since but overall a good movie. I also like the music for this movie.
B00008LDPU|5.0|When I watched the Matrix for the first time I thought that it was a good entertaining movie but nothing more. When I watched the Matrix Reloaded I thought that this was an intelligently written well done film. When I watched the Animatrix I thought this is pure sci-fi.<br />The Animatrix in my mind grounds the Matirx films as some of the most intelligent and well made sci-fi that has come out in a long time. Up on the level of film works like Blade Runner, 2001 &amp; Akira. Intentional or not, it also pays homage to great sci-fi books like William Gibsons Neuromancer and Frank Herberts Dune.<br />For a long time Japanese animation has picked up the slack of good sci-fi storytelling and concepts that most American sci-fi films have neglected. Look at Ghost in the Shell. The fact that the Matrix films are encompassing the deeper aspects of what makes good science fiction into something that the largely gullable American public can digest is wonderful. Like great science fiction, I will return to this stuff again and again to be taken in awe at the creative and intellectual forces that made this.<br />I can't wait for the third film.
B00009XITR|5.0|My friend and i went to see this movie together, and we had a BLAST! Amanda Bynes stars in this movie. I'm a fan of hers, so I was anticipating this movie greatly. <BR>  <BR>  Amanda is Daphne, a teen who lives in Chinatown with her former pop star mother, who now performs at parties and weddings, taking Daphne along as a waitress. She gets sick of seeing father-daughter dances, when her father is a British lord who doesn't know she exists. The aristocrat is played by Colin Firth. <br />  Daphne goes to England to see her father. She meets a boy named Ian, played by the super-hott Oliver James (after the movie my friend and i were fighting over who liked him more- we each had a DESPERATE crush!). Then Daphne goes to the palace, where she stays. Her new step-mother and step-sister make life miserable. But she and Henry Dashwood, her father, get close. But she, along with Ian, make a little too much mayhem, so as Henry gets loose (we see him dancing in tight leather pants!), Daphne gets stiff, blowing off Ian for the queen's royal tea! In the end, everything turns out great...predictably. <br />    Though this is a 'chick flick' and predictable, it was still a fun watch. :)
B00003CWL6|1.0|I'm sorry, but \\"American Beauty\\" is yet another overrated Best Picture Oscar winner. It protrays suburban midlife-crisis in a very smug, ridiculous, and pretentious manner. The characters have about as much depth and substance as those in a TV sitcom. They're shallow, smug, and superficial charicatures. The music, cinematography, and Wes Bentley's performance as the boy-next-door are the only redeeming qualities of this movie. If you want a more honest portrayal of a American suburban family in midlife-crisis, rent Robert Redford's \\"Ordinary People\\" from 1980. \\"American Beauty\\" is really just American trash.
B000083E79|5.0|There are few that started when Cher did that are doing other than the &quot;state fair&quot; circuit.  Cher's chameleonlike qualities have allowed her to last for over close to four decades.  That's not bad for the former Cherilyn Sarkisian from El Centro, CA.<br />To be honest, I had not paid attention to much of her work after the 80's until her &quot;rebirth&quot; with the monster smash from '99, &quot;Believe&quot;.  I purchased &quot;The Very Best of...&quot; in order to update my knowledge of the diva.<br />The &quot;discovery&quot; from the album that made it worthwhile is &quot;One on One&quot; from 1996's &quot;It's a Man's World&quot;. I don't know why the song didn't soar on the charts for it has one of Cher's most alluring vocals and also sports a killer musical/choral accompaniment.<br />THAT standout, among an album of standouts, makes this a purchase that I am glad to have made.
6305364613|1.0|This modern MTV version of \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" is another piece of trash taken from classic literature. William Shakespeare's name shouldn't have even been put above the title. The direction by Baz Lurrmann is designed mostly for the MTV teen crowd, with fast cuts and constantly moving cameras. It gets horrible from the get-go. Go rent the 1968 \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" instead, by Franco Zeffereli.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I wasn't sure about it on the first listen. I was waiting for the 'grabber' hook. I refused to give it that attention. Then I realized they're putting one over on everyone. They're not making intelligent music as much as they're demanding intelligent listeners. Which is why I think Hail to the Thief is hands down the best album of 2003. It's pure unabashed art rock and despite all the press and Thom's closed book stance, they want more because they're giving more. How ballsy.
B00003CX9Q|3.0|&quot;E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is probably the one Steven Spielberg film that has been labeled his &quot;masterpiece&quot;. While it's a well-made film on most counts, I can't regard it as such. The story is nothing special, and has been done better in countless other kid/animal movies like &quot;The Yearling&quot; and &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot;. It's basically a boy-and-his-dog story with a sci-fi twist; a boy and his alien. Henry Thomas is very believable as Elliot, and Robert McNaughton is a real hoot as his older brother Michael. Drew Barrymore is equally hilarious as Gertie. The problem I have with this movie is that it's so incredibly popular and I've seen it so many times that it has lost its ability to move me emotionally. It came out the same summer as another Spielberg hit &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, and &quot;E.T.&quot; completely outgrossed it. &quot;Poltergeist&quot; was an original haunted-house film, while &quot;E.T.&quot; is a rather tired formula story with several special ingredients to liven it up.
B000002KIE|5.0|The best punk album ever made, and of course it's British!  Those Brits really got the pop culture thing down, don't they?  I mean, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Slits... Well, never mind the you-know-what--here's the review for the Sex Pistols.<br />With martial stomping and a blaring angry guitar roar, the Cold War angst of \\"Holiday In The Sun,\\" one of my three favourites on this classic punk album rings off with references to Nazi concentration camps, the Berlin Wall, and maybe homophobia as well:  \\"...I was waiting for the Communist call/I didn't ask for sunshine/and I got World War III/I'm looking over the wall/and they're looking at me.\\"  Love that chanting of \\"reason reason\\" over the later verses!<br />The angry abortion thrash of \\"Bodies\\" is about Pauline from Birmingham, but at times, tells it from the would-be baby's POV.  The lyrics are harsh and unrelenting:  \\"Throbbing squirm, gurgling bloody mess/I'm not a discharge I'm not a loss in<br />protein I'm not a throbbing squirm Ah!\\"<br />\\"Feelings\\" is a song dealing with selfishness:  \\"I got no feelings/A-no feelings/for anybody else/(Except for myself<br />my beautiful self dear).\\"<br />\\"Liar\\" deals with reasons people lie, and there's that whiny and insistent and repetitive words motif that comes out:  \\"Lie lie lie lie liar you lie/lie lie lie lie tell me why tell me why.\\"  And so on.<br />In the black militant phrase, \\"you're either part of the problem or part of the solution,\\" the Pistols would go with the former:  \\"the problem is you!\\" in the song \\"Problems.\\"  One verse foretells the boring dead-end drudgery foretelling the corporate 80's:  \\"Eat your heart out on plastic tray/you don't do what you want/then you'll fade away/You won't find me working nine to five/it's too much fun a-being alive.\\"  Another great lyric:  \\"Don't you give me any orders/for people like me there is no order.\\"<br />For six weeks, the top song on the British charts was a long black line, and it is one of their signature tunes.  Everybody now:  \\"God save the Queen/the fascist regime/they made you a moron/a potential H-bomb/God save the Queen/she ain't no human being/There is no future/in England's dreaming.\\"  And love that nihilistic message:  \\"No future, no future for you.\\"  Note:  I heard somewhere that Paul McCartney used the verse \\"flowers in the dustbin,\\" and changed it to Flowers In The Dirt for his 1989 solo album.<br />The real punk attitude is brought out in \\"Seventeen\\":  \\"I don't work/I just speed/that's all I need.\\"<br />OK, signature tune number two, one that needs no song elaboration.  Ready everyone?  \\"I am an anti-Christ/I am an anarchist,/don't know what I want/but I know how to get it/I wanna destroy the passer by/'cos I wanna be anarchy/No dogsbody.\\"<br />The pace slows down a bit on \\"Sub-Mission\\" but comes back up on \\"Pretty Vacant,\\" another favourite here.  Apart from the \\"we're so pretty/oh so pretty/we're vacant/and we don't care,\\" there's another line that makes me laugh:  \\"I got no reason it's all too much/You'll always find us/out to lunch.\\"  Joan Jett covers this on The Hit List, BTW.<br />The final angry burst of sound that's \\"EMI\\" rails at the record distribution company and mainstream music:  \\"And blind acceptance is a sign/of stupid fools who stand in line like EMI.\\"  Joan Jett later did a version of this song called \\"MCA\\" against her own record label.<br />For Punk 101--the Classic Years, this is the proverbial one to get, then the Clash's self-titled one.

B00008J2DQ|2.0|Before the official release of \\"Faceless\\" Godsmack singer Sully Erna made a bold statement to the metal world and press by saying \\" I can guarantee you one thing right now, nobody is going to sound like this !#!$##$# record! I know bands said this before but that's b#@$#$#!. Staind, P.O.D, Korn I don't care they won't sound like this record!\\" Though it's quite true that in metal right now nobody with the exception of Metallica is sticking to metal and hard rock through classic roots of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath like Godsmack are, that doesn't mean that they have recorded a jaw dropping original masterpiece. Though Sully and company are overly excited and proud about this new material, it seems that the average metal listener has heard similar material before, not just through Godsmack's first two albums but through classic bands such as Alice In Chains and Metallica. Though Godsmack were never known for their originality, they knew how to take the best elements of grunge,metal, and hard rock and make it to a catchy radio friendly album \\"Godsmack\\". However that album didn't satisfy more metal hungry goers, which led Godsmack's credibility to be questioned. This led Godsmack to release a heavier, more industrial induced follow up \\"Awake\\". However many fans believed that Godsmack were using the same riffage as Sevendust and Alice In Chains. So now comes Faceless. \\"I can guarantee you one thing right now\\" It's now going to stop the critics that have questioned Godsmack for so long. The album is not horribly bad, there are great hooks and riffs scattered through the album, yet Godsmack play it safe and play similar material from their first and second album. \\"Straight out of Line\\" the first catchy single covered all to familiar territory from their first album but it's just less radio friendly. The track \\"Faceless\\" sounds like \\"Awake\\"s little cousin. \\"I Stand Alone\\" and \\"Dead and Broken\\" are catchy too but nothing special. Finally the last tracks sound like leftoversongs from \\"Godsmack\\" and \\"Awake\\" sessions that weren't good enough to make it on those albums. Though it's obvious that Godsmack weren't going to make a radical departure, it would have been nice if they at least been more creative with their lyrics \\"I F!#$&$ Hate you anyone!\\" Well Godsmack lovers will love this album and that's fine. But if you are a casual fan and really want to buy one of their albums then I suggest you might as well get Faceless since it has a lot of elements from their prior albums and very little new elements. Well, at least the new album art is cool.
B00000613T|4.0|Though Boulez version is bit mechanical and less emotional, however the control on the orchestra by maestro is superb while every contributions by instruments could be audible properly placed and balanced.  Comparatively to those over-lush interpretation, Boulez version stand as a better choice.  However my favourites are still Karajan 1980 and 1981 recordings which, though both depicts different levels of emotion and mood, are entirely enjoyable (I gave 5 stars).  Another favourite is Abbado's 2002 recording with Berlin which also earn 5 stars from myself.  The Berlin's violins under Abbado are so expressive, captivating most beautiful (especially in the 1st movement and the last movement), I rate it the best among them all.  There is another live recording that worth a try to listen to.  It is performed by Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Rudolf Barshai.  The recording is under BIS label (BIS-CD-632).  The recording is crystal clear and real.

Amazing!
B000096FUD|5.0|It seems no director is truly given the title of genius until he has at least one project that never makes it to fruition.  The same can be said for Orsen Welles, & even Walt Disney, who had several projects that never made it, including the recently-discovered 1946 collaboration with Salvador Dali entitled 'Destino'.  Anyway, as an avid fan of Terry Gilliam's since I first saw 'Brazil' at the age of 12, no other single director, with the possible exception of George Lucas, has stimulated my imagination to the degreee this man has.  A true auteur in every sense of the word, Gilliam is more akin to a musician, releasing a morsel of genius every 5 years or so to whet his fans' appetites.  Having not heard from the man since 1998's 'Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas' also starring Johhny Depp, I have been in dire need of a Gilliam fix for some time.  Of course the lavish & well-deserved DVD treatment some of his new & older films have received has made the wait more bearable.  Then I heard rumors he was directing Neil Gaiman's 'Good Omens' several years back, & my hope began to return.  After not hearing anything about that failed project for the next couple of years, I was again excited to hear he was adapting Don Quixote into a trademarked Gilliam-black comedy-timetravel-eyecandy piece his fandom had been waiting for.  Cut to 2 years later & reading about the horrific end this film came to, the health problems, set problems, & overall bad karma that seems to follow Gilliam around like bad B.O.  Then 'Lost in La Mancha' came to be & I was dying to see it in a theater.  Well, living in Tennessee, you can imagine it never got this far.  Anyway, I'm glad to see this FINALLY released on DVD in this country, having been out in Europe for several months now.  It's not much of a time pill, & Terry is getting close to his 70th birthday, but I still believe the man will grace us with his vision again, & hopefully be recognized as the true genius he is, before he leaves us for thatgreat financial pirate ship in the sky...
B000002UJQ|5.0|The greatest album by the greatest band
B000068PQ0|4.0|The only reason why I bought this CD was because of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1, which I heard on internet radio.  This catchy little jingle was running through my head for about a week before I decided that I had to know more about the artist and the rest of this CD.  Without really knowing about the rest of the songs on the album, I put my order in Amazon.  When I got the CD, I was pleasantly surprised, although it took a little while to get used to it.  As someone without any other experience with the Flaming Lips, the music sounds very experimental, with a lot of electronic synthesizers taking the forefront numerous times.  At first, I didn't like the CD much...but with repeated listenings, this CD has begun to grow on me, and I can't seem to go for a few days without giving it a spin.
0385504209|2.0|Although an interesting read, I do NOT encourage anyone to read The DaVinci Code.  This book is a blatant continuation of a centuries-old attack on the deity of Jesus Christ and a call for the return of paganism.  The \\"proof\\" that Jesus Christ is not God, nor claimed to be God, is none other than the works of Leonardo DaVinci...of course, the fact that DaVinci lived 1500 years after Christ does not deter Dan Brown from concluding that DaVinci's work is more credible than the contemporaries of Jesus Christ who recorded Jesus Christ's own words, such as, \\"I and the Father are one,\\" which is the reason why the religious leaders of the day sought to kill him (see John 10:30 & 31).<br />To refute the Gospels that were written by eye-witnesses, Brown alludes to the gnostic gospels which were not written during the first generation of the Church and were written as the first attacks against the deity of Jesus Christ. Surprisingly, although Brown considers Jesus Christ a pivotal person in history, he never brings up the most significant reason that Jesus Christ changed time as we know it (B.C. and A.D.): over 500 people, including the Roman soldiers guarding his tomb, witnessed his resurrection from the dead and his ascension into heaven a month and a half later!<br />What makes this an intriguing read is that in trying to build a case for worship of the goddess, Brown uses imagery from the Garden of Eden-a biblical theme.  The innocent Eve, Sophie Neveu, is being tempted by both the knowledgeable but naive Adam, Robert Langdon, and by the devil himself: the deceptive and terribly capable, Sir Leigh Teabing. In Brown's story, Adam prevails over the devil because of Eve and Eve is exalted as the pinnacle of creation.  That's a noble story but Brown creates it by debasing the deity of Jesus Christ and the history of Christianity.<br />In Brown's tale, Mary Magdalene, not the Apostle Peter, is the rightful \\"head\\" of the Church (which is not an accurate statement of St. Peter's role as defined by Jesus Christ anyway). Mary Magdalene, the supposed wife of Jesus Christ, is the beloved disciple, not the Apostle John.  It was the male disciples who, in Brown's tale, are anti-women and who in order to build an empire, suppressed the truth about Jesus and Mary and about Mary's rightful role.  However, Brown fails to re-state that for this empire, all of Jesus Christ's disciples (except for John) suffered excrutiating deaths for their belief that Jesus Christ was God come in the flesh (St. Peter was crucified on a cross up-side down; others were boiled alive, cut in half, fed to lions...and so it continued for three centuries under various Roman rulers!).<br />Apparently, Brown hopes his tale will convince nominal Catholics, Mormons who accept \\"extra-scripture\\" texts, and other religiously-minded people who are vaguely aware of who Jesus Christ is and who recognize DaVinci, Mozart and Newton, among others, as historical and therefore credible figures.  My advice: Don't spend the money.'s role as defined by Jesus Christ anyway). Mary Magdalene, the supposed wife of Jesus Christ, is the beloved disciple, not the Apostle John.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I first saw this film at the El Capitan theater in Hollywood with English subtitles.  At the time, I thought that the movie was amazing from a creative standpoint, but there were a few of things that I left somewhat confused about.  <br />The English version of Spirited Away adds a lot of dialogue that was not included in the Japanese version with English subtitles to help clear the confusion.  Namely, they added a lot of dialogue to scenes that may not have transitioned well between cultures, such as the \\"cutting of evil\\" and the ending.  <br />As for the movie itself...I've seen it about five times now, each time with a new group of friends that seemed really reluctant to watch a \\"cartoon.\\"  It is a testament to this film's accessibility to all ages that by the end of each of these screenings, everyone who saw it fell in love with the film.  It is truly a masterpiece of imagination and creatvity.

This scene is totally unrealistic (I know it's not suppose to be real, but sheeesh)and was dragged out entirely too long, which makes it lose it's effectiveness of being a thrilling moment (I mean, how long do we expect someone to continually scream before we start looking at our watches and begin impatiently whistling).  <br />That being said, I still say this movie stands above some of the so-called thrillers out there of this type (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc). The notion that this movie promotes is that one probably shouldn't mess with fate because, in the end, it will eventually catch up with you. The high school student who sees the tragic events before they happen just does a little too much to try to secure his fate once he figures out he has this power and, before long, he is helpless against it because he has altered things. <br />Overall, a so-so movie. It does have some suspenseful moments and it is likely to entertain you. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
0140067477|5.0|This book offers great insight into life and modern society. It is true that this book doesn't go too deep into philosophy, and I respect that. Because, it's not a book about philosophy--it's a book about life. The philosophy contained in the Tao of Pooh is directly applicable to everyday life and reflects real life.<br />There are great references and stories in the Tao of Pooh. I was delighted to learn about The Vinegar Tasters, though I still can't find a scroll of it to hang on my wall, and of Master Li who lived an extraordinary number of years.
B00008LDPU|3.0|I had mixed feelings after watching this dvd.  <br />\\"Final Flight Of the Osiris\\" is hands down the stand out short story, and it is good, having most to do with the actual Matrix movies than the rest of this mixed bag did.<br />Some of the stories in this offering are just crazy, disjointed, R-rated cartoons that don't look or feel like anything from the Matrix with the exception of some of the terminology used.<br />What's worse is that (at least I deduced) the people who created these cartoons are actually attached to the Matrix movies.  Some of this was just [bad], in my opinion, and doesn't belong to be associated with the Matrix franchise.<br />Also the quality of some of these cartoons just did not live up to the \\"state of the art\\" quality advertised with this dvd.  Once again the \\"Osiris\\" story far outperformed the other ones.<br />This dvd is not for everyone.  Hardcore Matrix fans will probably like it quite a bit but less-involved fans who just think it's a cool story will be less likely to embrace some of the material...
B000078DOI|5.0|Mother's Milk is the Peppers 4th album released before their masterpiece Blood Sugar Sex Magik. This is their first album with new guitarist John Frusciante, and drummer Chad Smith replacing respectively the deceased Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons. Both new members prove their importance to the band with guitar salvos reminescent of Hendrix by Frusciante, and the tight rhythm and powerful style of Smith. Original members Flea and Anthony Kiedis bring the funk as well. Flea's bass style had become increasingly virtousic over the albums and his bass shines throughout. Anthony Kiedis brings his lyrics and vocals in tip top form, varying from rap to wacked out funk. <BR>     My favorite's are Good Time Boys with its tight bass line, good vocals, aggressive drumming, and virtuosic guitar work. The Stevie Wonder cover Higher Ground is breakneck from start to finish with slap bass intro from Flea, guitar solo, and great sped up ending. The tribute to Hillel Slovak Knoc Me Down with a more melodic progression and Anthony shines throughout. Stone Cold Bush with a vicious bass line and bass solo, funky guitar intro and screeching solo, the lyrics shine as well. Sexy Mexican Maid is also a standout track with its laid back groove, playful guitar backing Anthony's sensual lyrics, and great guitar break. This album proves that you cant fake the funk and is a great display of the Pepper's earlier work.
B00005JM1F|2.0|Although Luke Wilson is nowhere near as annoying as his brother, he still is not the guy I'd pick for the lead in any comedy.  He's just not that funny.  Will Farrell is crazy as always, and he's probably the funniest one in the movie.  Vince Vaughn just comes across as a jerk, and he's one in the movie.<BR>This movie had some potential, but I felt that it [really went down hill] after the first fifteen minutes or so.  Other than the little bit of soft core porn that Wilson's wife was watching at the beginning, and the disgusting shot of Farrell running around naked, I can't see what the big deal was regarding this movie's \\"bad stuff\\" that is stressed at the beginning.<BR>This movie is just not that funny.  It's really kind of a downer, and Wilson is the prime reason why.  He's a loser, and more of a wimpy, unlikeable one to boot.  Each scene just crashes into the other, and there is no reason to watch it a second time.<BR>Maybe some of you will find this funny, but I sure as heck did not.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was quite possibly one of the greatest album's ever. The production by George Martin was revolutionary and his production techniques still sound fresh to this day. The songs have seamless transitions into each other and  every track is memorable. My favorite's  on the album are With a Little Help From My Friends, with it's playful lyrics and laid back beat, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds with its trippy lyrics and psychadelic melody, Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite with its carnival like sound, a great vocal from John Lennon and marching bass of Paul McCartney, When I'm Sixty Four with it's sped up vocals and lyrics about old age, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) with its screaming guitar breaks. This album is one of the most memorable of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good album young or old.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I don't think I found a single memorable track on this c.d.!  I remember buying it and sitting there waiting for a track as good as, say, &quot;One Step Closer.&quot;  Well I listened to the whole album six times and was badly disappointed.  <BR>Not only is a big step in the wrong direction for Linkin Park, but everything sounds forced and generic.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt they could have done a lot better.<BR>Nothing stood out on this album to me.<BR>I threw it out after struggling to make it half way through a seventh time in an attempt to find something beyond average... aren't these guys supposed to go on tour with Metallica this summer?  Hell, they better just play stuff from Hybrid theory and perhaps some of the Reanimation remix stuff unless they plan on putting the crowd to sleep.
0140439110|5.0|The original version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is much different than you would expect, if you haven't read it before.  It plays out as a mystery of sorts.  A lawyer friend of Jekyll tries to find out what the relationship is between the respectable Dr Jekyll and the lowlife Mr Hyde.  It is not revealed until near the end of the story that they are in fact the same man.  Of course, nowadays everyone is aware of that before they have even read this story.  Naturally, a lot of the suspense of the story is lost due to this.  Still, this story became a classic for a reason and is well worth a read.  And it's short too, for you kids looking for a short book to read for a book report.  There are two other suspense stories by Stevenson included here, too.  These two are not classics, but they are also enjoyable.
B000060P79|5.0|I think that Simple Plan's album is awesome! There are so many good songs on it and bonus stuff when you pop the disc into your computer. If you like the C.D you should check out the guys.... They are super nice and always willing to meet new fans, sign things and take pictures!! ...check them out!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|If it gets any better than this, God help us all.  Once again Led Zeppelin prove that they were the greatest rock and roll band of all time.  There are a lot of mixed reviews floating around about this DVD.  All I can say is that you either &quot;get&quot; it or you don't...and a lot of people just don't get it.  They don't completely understand what they're seeing - four musical powerhouses who have never been and will never be equalled.
B000002H72|4.0|The track listing for this CD is wrong; it's missing track 15, &quot;Gouge Away&quot;. The &quot;correct errors&quot; option at the base of the page does not provide for a way to recommend a correction to this at this time.<br />This is a very enjoyable CD, if nothing else, because of the hilarity that can ensue when you realise that what you thought you'd been hearing lyrics-wise was not /this/ but /that/. Then you get to decide whether your misheard lyrics are better.<br />But there is much else. This is a very enjoyable album, and it is to my shame that I am unable to properly describe why. Perhaps it is the haunting beauty of &quot;Silver&quot;, the frank simplicity of &quot;La La Love You&quot;. Perhaps it is just the crazy lyrics, as in &quot;Hey&quot;: &quot;This is the sound a mother makes when her baby breaks.&quot; Mmm, yes. Very good. My favourite has to be Mr Grieves, but all the tracks are memorable.
B0000029DD|5.0|And buy it now. He is one of the greatest artists... i'm searching for the right phrase, but all i can come up with is... of all time. His voice is nothing short of astounding. His Lyrics are the most touching, sincere and eloquent that i have ever heard. Infused with a melancholy that is inescapable, you can do nothing but experience every word he sings. It seems wrong to try and pin-point the 'stand-out' tracks as none are found wanting. However I shall say something of my personal favourites at this point in time. 'Lover, you should've come over'. I'm not sure what to say, other than i must have heard it well in excess of 500 times and it still demands my full attention. I have never experienced emotions quite like he is expressing but for five and a half minutes i'm living them. 'Eternal life' is, as my mother put it, what he would have sounded like if he were cheerful. It drags you in and has you jumping everytime. And 'Last goodbye'. The lyric is infused with a wisdom beyond his years while being something that most can relate to. <BR>Unfortunately, for the purpose of this review, it is impossible to put his genius into words. The music speaks for itself.<BR> Someone once said to me that music could never be what it once was as our generation had lost its soul. Jeff Buckley is my proof against that, unfortunatly there is very little else to join him.

0385504209|1.0|Don't believe the hype.  This is a very basic thriller, containing information that's standard in an introductory college-level art history class.  The &quot;puzzles&quot; are laughable at best, character development is nil, and the writing style is about ninth grade. Plenty of artistic license has been taken with history.  If you enjoy formulaic stories, you'll like it; if you want more substance, you probably won't.

B00000K19E|4.0|There isn't much I can say about The Matrix that has not already been said. It is truly a visionary film that mixes real human drama about self and the meaning of life into a slick science fiction piece that is truly approachable by sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike. The DVD package, however, could have stood some more extra features, besides the few behind the scenes shorts that came with it. A piece about some of the philosophy behind some of the things that happen in the movies, or the names used, would have been nice. The picture is clear on the DVD, the sound is good, and the transfer is top notch. All that stops me from giving it a 5-star rating is the lack of extras.
0375414053|4.0|Kate Reddy (the protagonist) was a little hard for me, a working mom, to identify with because with a full-time nanny, a housekeeper and a chronically helpful husband, her whining was a little far-fetched.  Having said that, despite this minor annoyance I really couldn't put this book down and was sorry when I finished it.  I was fun to read, and I can only hope that my newly purchased \\"Babyville\\" will be as captivating.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is one of the better put together packages for a DVD. It includes two cuts of the film (the theatrical version and the special director's cut) which are nice inclusions. The extended cut is nice because it allows you to see how the deleted scenes fit into the movie, and unlike many movies, the deleted scenes were given full production, i.e., they are finished celluloid, not just spot copies or some such. There are plenty of extras to keep even the most intrepid fan busy, including theatrical trailers and commercials from around the globe, and that is nice as well. Very well done DVD!
B000002UW1|4.0|Considering that this was R.E.M.'s strongest collection of songs since their debut, there's a strange sense of uncertainty about the whole project.<br />You listen to the first four cuts and think &quot;Aha, another political statement from the band that brought you Lifes Rich Pageant the previous year.&quot;  Taken together, &quot;Finest Worksong,&quot; &quot;Welcome to the Occupation,&quot; &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot; and &quot;Disturbance at the Heron House&quot; sound very much like a sort of State of the Union address.  In each cut you get a different take on America - the dignity of its workers, the evils of its interference overseas, its historical insistence on conformity and its domestic paranoia.  &quot;McCarthy&quot; has a few awkward moments, but overall the music displays this band's usual mastery of style and technique; these songs move.  Then there's a cover version of Pylon's &quot;Strange&quot; and the whole thing breaks apart.<br />I can't help thinking that the interruption is deliberate.  R.E.M. had played plenty of covers before, and even recorded a few, but this was almost the first time they put one on a regular album release, and it's about as close to punk as they had come.  (There was &quot;Superman&quot; the previous year, but that one came at the end of the collection rather than the middle, and it was an obvious throwaway.)  &quot;Strange&quot; is like a signal to the listener, saying &quot;Whatever you think you've been hearing, that's not it.&quot;  Then the band proceeds to prove it - the rest of &quot;Document&quot; has nothing to do with political commentary.<br />&quot;The One I Love&quot; and &quot;It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; both scored big on the singles charts, and I can't imagine why, since they're both among the slipperiest hits ever recorded.  They're both terrific, mind - &quot;One I Love&quot; introduces a classic R.E.M. riff and a devastating lyric, and &quot;End of the World&quot; is both nice poetry and enormous fun.  But the first of these songs doesn't mean what you think it does, and the second doesn't really seem to mean anything at all.  Why in the world did the audience take to them so strongly?  (I know, I know, they have good beats and you can dance to them, but still...)<br />The next two numbers are more R.E.M. American grotesquerie a la &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; - &quot;Fireplace&quot; is a pounding rock waltz about preparations for a hoedown that turn destructive and &quot;Lightnin' Hopkins&quot; is a vicious bluesy stomp that has about as much to do with the old bluesman of the title as the Ramones do (which may be more than I think, actually).  And then &quot;Document&quot; closes out with a couple of straight-ahead surrealist nightmares, &quot;King of Birds&quot; and &quot;Odd Fellows Local 151,&quot; with music straight out of a Ken Kesey Acid Test and lyrics by Salvador Dali or something.  They wouldn't have been out of place on R.E.M.'s dada debut, &quot;Murmur&quot; - the music is folksy but driven, the lyrics are confusing but significant, the vocal and playing style shouldn't work but they do.  It feels like you should be able to dismiss this stuff as self-indulgent, but you can't.  It means something, dammit.<br />Taken all together, &quot;Document&quot; is about as disorienting as a game of blind man's bluff.  It lurches from simple tunesmithing to scorching rock to something unidentifiable that drifts right through your head and back out into the sky.  And here's a thought - in 1987, R.E.M. faced a number of important decisions, like what record company to sign with and whether to tour Europe.  In short, they were getting famous, and I wonder if &quot;Document&quot; is the sound of a band trying to figure out whether to give its fans some good old-fashioned pop or stick with its twisted art-house roots.<br />Now, that's the kind of struggle can result in great music, when it doesn't produce a nervous breakdown instead.  Fortunately, by the time R.E.M. had to face this pressure, they had been playing together for going on ten years and evidently trusted each other.  So they could look outward and inward both at once, knowing that they had each other's backs.  Every time Peter Buck bangs out a chord, or Bill Berry and Mike Mills trade backing vocal lines, or Michael Stipe hollers &quot;Listen to me!&quot;, you can hear the band's defiance and excitement in the face of the world's demands.<br />&quot;Document&quot; is a summing up of R.E.M.'s career to that point, an important step to take before any giant leap.  They may have felt fragmented, pulled in different directions, like that glass sculptor on the cover whose body is shattered in a million pieces by his materials, but there's no doubt that they were still in control of each piece.

B00008DDXC|4.0|The biggest thing about the Harry Potter movies in the positives column is that they have managed to make the movies accessable to those who are not fans of the book, even though this has at times come at the chagrin of those who are devoted afficionados of the books. The movie is a solid piece of cinematography that handles the story and the characters quite well, even though it would seem that some of the minor plot points that were lifted directly from the books could have been better explained for those of us who have not read the books. Overall, a solid movie, and a solid DVD.

B000063S6Z|4.0|18 seems in many spots to be an attempt to follow up what Play was, and this would be something very hard to do. Play was just one of those albums that stood out on its own merits thanks to its innovativeness and sheer brilliance. This is not to say that 18 is not a good album, because it is, but it seems that it was Moby trying a bit hard to live up to the success that Play afforded him. There are still gems among the CD's 18 tracks, but Play is a better place to start for those unfamiliar with Moby.

The tempo is good for me. gBelieveh never makes me bored, so I can listen to the song anywhere and all the time. If you listen to gBelieveh once, you will be fascinated and will become one of her fans!! This track concludes Cherfs new style. I think she used to sing like in an Enka style which is a kind of melodramatic Japanese popular song, which young people donft often listen to. But now, young people feel a sense of closeness to her songs. This is a strong change. The other songs on the album are also good. All her music is comfortable to listen to. gAll or Nothingh is one of my favorites, too. Especially, you can enjoy her voice in each song. Cherfs voice is a unique thing.<br />Cher is as good as any young famous singer. She still looks young and she is still a very famous singer who is loved by many fans. I think some singers cannot be famous for a long time, it is difficult to keep being popular, but Cher has succeeded in doing this. <br />Finally, in addition to her singing career, I knew she also became an actress later. I have watched some of her movies. Again, at first I didnft notice the actress was Cher. I was really surprised about her background. Ifm looking forward to listening to her next album and I will continue to be one of her fans.

B000002H33|5.0|Listening to Master of Puppets it is very sad to see where Metallica and metal music in general went from here.  This is the height of 80's metal.  This is the only Metallica CD I own, although Ride the Lightning and Kill em all were very good.  I burned out on those albums, but this one never gets old.  Orion may be the greatest instumental ever.  Not only did metallica die when Cliff Burton died, but the evolution of metal turned to de-evolution and now we're left with garbage like St.Anger and the other nu-metal.  It makes anyone who grew up in the 80's metal days very sad.

B00004WGY9|4.0|I owned this album in vinyl, wore the grooves out, couldn't decipher any of the lyrics but didn't care, lost it in a cross country move, and have been craving it ever since.  <br />The CD repackage includes several wonderful photos; quite a switch from the LP, which, consistent with the universal soul rebel theme,  did not depict the musicians.  It includes lyrics, which are also rather wonderful, and make all the great songs sound new again.  Finally, we get liner notes from Kevin Archer, which are informative of the band's processes, if a bit weak as to the source of inspiration.  For after all, even if the band did set out to pay homage to a certain neglected corner of soul music, what resulted was a unique and delightful pop artifact, full of witty and modern songwriting, and vocalizing that no one has dared before or since.  The horns blast away in all their retro glory, while Rowlands weaves more literary figures into his lyrics than Lloyd Cole and Morrissey combined! <br />There's an ambience here that isn't present in any other &quot;rock&quot; recording I know, with the possible exception of the Flamin' Groovies' &quot;Shake Some Action&quot;  In both records, the band members subordinate themselves so completely to the channeling of the sacred text, that authorship almost ceases to matter.  But unlike the Groovies, who had several recordings under their belts, this was a debut album, and the band, for all we knew, could have been visitors from another (very cool) planet. <br />Four stars only because there isn't more of it.

I'm not usually a frantic-type reader - reading a book in a day . . . but this was an exception! Sophie Kinsella really hit the head on the nail with this book.  Even though I may not live in London, not understand some of the financial things mentioned, it does relate to real life.  People are always finding themselves in binds, or secretly falling in love with someone, and people are always trying to make more money. Society proves we need more, which Becky Bloomwood knows a lot about.  After she became aware of the financial bind she was in, she just can't seem to have any method of getting money to work for her. She's not doing too good trying to cut-back her spendings, but can't seem to find a way to make money.  With some comedy, heart*brakes, and falling into love. . . this book has caught the attention and affection of mine and others. Will it catch yours?
B00008OLYN|5.0|I've heard 'Damnation'  being called folk metal, progressive rock, psychaedelic rock a la the 70's, and a few other labels that don't do Opeth's latest release a bit of justice.  The first word that comes to mind when listening to Damnation is 'beautiful'.  If sound is nothing more than the arrangement of sound waves into patterns that create harmonies which are pleasing to the ear, then Opeth has succeeded in mastering the art of creating beautiful sounds.  A complete break from Opeth's previous releases, Damnation features little distorted guitar and no growling death metal vocals.  The vocals always carry a harmony that is well thought out and fits perfectly with the guitar work.  No instrument dominates the recording and the atmosphere created by the haunting subtlety of each song's melody combined with the gloomy art work and title of 'damnantion' makes this cd a near-perfect listening experience.  Damnantion was recorded at the same session as Deliverance, but I feel that Damnantion is the true jewel that arose from the recording session.  The theme of the cd seems to be loss, as in the loss of a loved one, but the theme of death never seems to leave the picture with Opeth as is seen in many of their previous releases.  The only part of the cd that I will dare to criticize is the drum sound.  The actual performance on the drums is excellent and demonstrates Opeth's drummer's ability to switch between blazingly fast metal drumming to calm percussion that sits in the background of the music.  However, the drum sound leaves something to be desired.  The toms do not have the sort of sound I enjoy and nor does the snare.  drums are not only a beat keeping insturment, but also an insturment that produces a tone through resonance of the drum skins, and the drum tone on Damnantion sounds more like pieces of plastic than anyhting else.  I was able to move past this 'problem' and it bothers me no longer.  If anyhting, I was simply searching for some flaw in this cd which seems about a perfect as one can imagine.  If you are expecting fast, thrashy metal with hints of folk-like melody that can be heard in Opeth's previous releases, do not be disappointed when you hear no such genre of music.  Damnation might be calssified as acoustic rock/metal/progressive/whatever you want to call it, but I think that the only worthy way to classify 'Damnantion' is by using the word 'beautiful'.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Perhaps this album leaves me so speechless, that I hold not many words to describe it.<BR>Or perhaps there is simply so much going on, it blows my mind.<BR>Never-the-less, on I try...<br />This is perhaps my favorite CD. And definitely my favorite of Converge.<BR>They have only gotten harder/louder/crazier/better/more unique with time.<br />Every song on this CD is amazing.<br />Converge's music doesn't come off as form of 'normal' whatsoever. This CD and each track comes off as one big continuous body of audio art.<BR>Tracks lengths vary from being under 2 minutes all the way to over 11 minutes, and mix and overlap together...<br />The frantic guitars that mix screeching in and out and clangs and yummy chugg's and the brilliant melodies that come from them just have to bring a smile to your face.<BR>Speaking of frantic, the drums are amazing. They chime in when you least expect it and pound unusually scattered 'beats.'<BR>The vocals of Jacob Bannon are perhaps the most distinguished of any hardcore/metalcore band.<BR>Screeching, squealing throat-numbing screams, that seem to spawn straight from hell.<BR>And when he throws in his odd singing style, it reminds me of a possessed doll smiling as it holds a knife behind it's back about to stab you in the neck.<BR>I realize that 98% of the lyrics are flat out impossible to hear.<BR>But still, the lyrics are clips of vague poetic beauty.<BR>The over all sound is unlike anything I've heard.<BR>It doesn't even stay 'hard' all the time, occasionally bringing it down a few notches to a contradictory explanation of 'unsteadily-thumpingly-serene soundscapes', that I adore.<BR>This music is simply/complexly all over the place. It has to be heard...<br />Choosing one word to describe this CD would result in a brawl between 'Amazing' and 'Brilliant'...and 'Mindbending' would try it's damndest to convince them it is the right choice, by professing it is just one word.<br />And Just as the Album is, the song 'Jane Doe' is epic in somany different ways...<BR>It may take a few listens to appreciate this CD as something besides just 'noise,' if you aren't prepared for what it contains...
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is Absolutely astonishing. She is Smart Business women, a Awesome Performer she is better than most young artest today who will no even be remembered in a year. She Pretty. Her Very best CD is Just awesome! I have a 6 CD slots in my car and well this CD is played the most. If you have bought the CD this is a must have!
B00005JM09|5.0|Finally, a movie sequel that will actully be good!<BR>Terminator 3 will be the best action/adveture movie of the year...and here's why.<br />1. Jonathan Mostow is the director, his directing stlye (in my oppion) is almost identical to Cameron's.  I know James Cameron probally would have been beter (if he didn't have backed out of the project); but, Mostow directed U-571 and I know he has what it takes to make T3 a excellent movie.<br />2. The film is rated \\"R\\", for no-holds-bar non-stop action and violence.  Don't expect T3 to any censor-oriented scenes. (Unlike the lame \\"Matrix Reloaded\\")<br />3. It took the cast and crew a very long time to make this movie.  A full 3-min teaser was out for the movie over a year ago.<br />4. The special FX's will astonishing!  They will most-likely win an Academy Award, if the Academy dosen't go politcal and give it to LOTOR for the third straight year!<br />5.  Just look at the trailers!  Seriously!  GO LOOK AT THE TRAILERS!!
1400034779|2.0|I have read the overwhelmingly glowing critiques of this book and wonder if I read the same book.  I thought this was an uneven, predictable novel that made me wonder what could have been done with such rich material and such potentially interesting characters in the hands of a better author.  I am certain this will show up as some equally inept made for tv movie.  The bestseller list is not usually a barometer of good literature, and this book proves it to me once again.
B00009TB5G|3.0|From a theatrical standpoint, The Two Towers was well done.  The acting, special effects, etc. were excellent.  In my opinion TTT was the best movie of 2002.<br />It is understandable that any movie based on a book will deviate to a certain extent.  The Fellowship of the Ring was well done and deviations were acceptable.  The Two Towers deviates much more from pure Tolkien.  Some deviations are acceptible, however, there are several key alterations to the plot that are very dissapointing and without reason.<br />Gandalf's battle with the Balrog was excellent and a welcome addition since the book leaves this part to imagination.  Well done.<br />I enjoyed the warg battle since the book only briefly mentions the wargs and including them would be impossible without a confrontation.  However, Aragorn falling off the cliff was just an emotional ploy to enrich the cheezy love story included in the movie.<br />Faramir's weakened character along with Frodo's forced journey to Osgiliath was completely uncalled for.  Frodo still utimately is set free and heads to Mordor so why change the plot?  That part of the movie also felt very rushed.<br />Adding Elves to the battle of Helm's Deep makes for a much more visually stunning battle and can be overlooked.  It was described in the book, however as a victory for the world of men.  It seemed that after an hour of building up the battle that it came to a very abrubt end after Gandalf showed up.  Within a minute of Gandalf showing up, he's stating that the battle for Helm's Deep is over and that the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.  We see men and elves getting their butts kicked.  How about seeing some Orc butt being kicked before suddently ending the battle sequence? (Maybe in the extended version)<br />I would have also liked to see more development of the Ents and not as idiots as the film makes them out to be.<br />I've watched the film 4 times and each time it has grown on me a little more.  However from a purist standpoint, the FOTR stays much more true to the book. <br />I look forward to the extended version and hope to see additional footage that moves the movie back towards the book rather than futher away.  This movie receives 3 stars for great action, special effects and a good attempt at re-creating Middle Earth.  It loses two stars for unacceptible deviations from the book.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Good god.  I really don't know how to sum up this album, anything i say is only really gonna tell half the story, but i'll give it a go.  I was/am a massive ATD-I fan, and was really excited about the mars volta when i heard they were getting together.<br />This album expands on a lot of the musical and lyrical concepts which ATD-I brushed on, but TMV are a great deal more expressive and experimental in their execution.  Hints of Fugazi, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and even Santana are obvious - the entire album has the feeling of a band trying to get out of themselves - pushing their collective musical ability to breaking point.  I saw these guys in a tiny club here in Glasgow, and it was one of the most off-the-hook shows i've ever seen (i saw ATD-I there too, but thats beside the point) - the album comes pretty close to capturing the energy and excitement of a live show.<br />Maybe the coolest thing about the album is its variety - its not uncommon to hear some prog rock, punk, funk, then through to salsa and latin, in the same song....<br />I can only hope that TMV don't go the same way as At The Drive-In, and that this is only the start of an amazing experimental journey.<br />Buy this now - your life just wouldn't be complete without it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Leaving all the negativity that could be imposed on a new band like getting compared to another one every sec, Evanescence is surely one of the biggest acts of 2003.Gettin a lil bit inspiration from Linkin Park and takin it further ,\\"Fallen\\" grows on you in each new listening ; believe me it wont take that long to get used to it. Here's my short review of \\"Fallen\\" track by track.<br />Going Under: 10/10 One of the major highlights of the album and personally my fave.With a great intro and a suprisingly good chorus, \\"Goin Under\\" meets all your expectations in the first place.<br />Bring Me To Life: 10/10 A track that started it all,setting a great example to how a dramatic intro can turn into a massive rock track followed with the amazing vocals by Paul Mccoy.<br />Everybody's Fool: 9/10 Although sounds very familiar at the first listening, the track is promising with its brill chorus.Impressive lyrics tho'<br />My Immortal: 10/10 Not only because of belonging to one of the emotional scenes of \\"Daredevil\\", \\"My Immortal\\" gives a lifetime chance to Amy Lee to show her vocal strength. A haunting and an equally brilliant track gettin the label of \\"one of the major highlights of the album\\".<br />Haunted: 8,5/10 Dark and a good follow up with the previous tracks, gets u with its fab chorus.<br />Tourniquet:10/10 Getting very dark with its different chorus, Tourniquiet is another major highlight of the album. Lyrically one of the best and nearly perfect with its melody.Check out the \\"I want to die\\" part :)<br />Imaginary: 8,5/10 Personally takes me ages to get used to this track, Imaginary is a weird track but a great follow up to Tourniquet.<br />Taking Over Me: 10/10 My second fave coming closely after \\"Goin Under\\".Impressive chorus and a great tune together make this song one of the best of the album. Outstanding music, gorgeous lyrics so what are you askin for more?<br />Hello: 7,5/10 Good track but there's somethin weird about it as it doesnt fit the album although Amy's vocals are brilliant on the track.<br />My Last Breathe: 7/10 Surely not one of the highlights of the album, it's getting less than average after the first listening. I can say it's the weakest track on the album with the following \\"Whisper\\".<br />Whisper:7/10 Melody and the lyrics are good but it makes you feel that somethin is seriously missin in that track. Maybe that's because it doesn't have an additional thing when its compared to the previous tracks and just a victim of being the last song of the album.<br />Overall the album deserves an attention with its unique sound and dark atmosphere. It seems recently majority of the artists try to put on happy faces with their music but we know that life aint \\"that\\" happy right?At least this album has the guts to show that.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I just want to say that listening to this album helped me through a very tough time in my life recently. My dad was in the hospital dying. I would listen to this album every day on the way to the hospital (an hour drive) and on the way home. It was my -- \\"beautiful release.\\" I could see Sarah sitting beside a hospital bed writing some of these songs because what she was saying was exactly how I felt.<br />Now, 30 some days later, my dad is finally on the road to recovery but it was a tough ride that I wasn't sure we were all going to get through. I'm so thankful Sarah's music was there to help me. I've always said she has the voice of an angel and now I know it is true.<br />Blessings,<BR>K.S. Liester
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is by far the greatest album of the 90's i know alot of people say that \\"the bends\\" radioheads pervious album before \\"ok computer\\" was a superior album, but i do not agree. This is the most moving album i have heard since pink floyds \\"dark side of the moon\\". This album is rich in emotion and meening ...
B000099T2L|5.0|I won't say much, U have to listen to the album to understand how great it is. As a huge fan of her and of Destiny's Child I've been expecting this album for a long long time, and my expectaions of it were high in the sky. Was I disappointed? Not A chance. Beyonce is one of the greatest music artists of this days (if not the greatest), and she proves it with this cd. She deserves every award she'll get this year and in the follow years, and I'm sure she will get them.
B00005JLSC|5.0|...My opinion about Chicago is that it's a very good movie, eventhough the story is a bit strange, but the songs are beautiful. Some people might not find this musical very interesting, because they might dislike musicals from their early age. Musicals are full of inspirations, hopes and love. Some people might say that many  musicals, such as Chicago, do not contain love, all I could say to that is it does. If you look closely into one of the characters in Chicago, Amos Hart, you will find the love that he has for his wife, Roxie.
B00005JKZV|5.0|When I was 14, I picked up a book called The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring.  It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I had already read The Hobbit, but I didn't want to read a sequel to it.  I thought it would be dull and monotonous.  I was wrong.  Since then I have read each of the three books at least four times, since I had to read lesser books for school.  <BR>   Then, I watched The Fellowship for the first time on video.  I loved it.  Soon, the sequel came, it was spectacular.  However, it is not as good as the first, I think, seeing as how it strays away from the books a bit.  But that doesn't make it any worse, just because it's a little diff't.  A few of those scenes are:  The Wolves of Isengard, and the Evenstar scenes.  Also, I don't like the way they portraid King Theoden.  He is a kindly old man, and no longer fears death, though they make it seem like he's a cranky old man, who's paranoid because of all hte death.  Still, I would only add onto it, not change it.With the superb choice of actors, and the story, it has become one of the best movies of all time.  My personal favourites are Gimli and Saruman.  They are played by experienced actors, and are just as I imagined them.  <BR>    I would reckomend this movie to anyone who is bored, and has a lot of free time.  It is very long.  Still, I would like it to keep going.  It's great.  I wish it would never end.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this album is truely amazing. it is so fresh, so clean. beautifully recorded. this passes normal music. this is art. never have i heard anything close to this nature, but if you blend at the drive in, pink floyd, and music transitions like tool, then you might get a taste of this. but dont listen to me, buy it now. it is wonderful
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd Let Go is great.  I am sick of you people bashing her and saying she's fake.  That isn't the point of these reviews.  They are supposed to be about the cd not the singer.  Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean they don't have talent.  Avril does a great job combining pop, rock, and punk.  This a really good cd.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes those three genres.  My favorite songs are \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", and \\"Sk8er Boi.\\"
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's latest album YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT is an interesting musical experience. The album definately grows on you with each listen, as there's something new to discover each time. Jeff Tweedy's vocals work well with the material, and sometimes the music often seems like a late night low fi radio broadcast. That's the general feeling I get of the album. The album opens with the brilliant &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, a 7 minute epic song. This album is definately hard to review, there's so much going on it seems but it's an interesting album. There's some great moments that are truly beautiful like &quot;Radio cure&quot;, &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;. This is definately music for those who are tired of the blandness of what's out there right now, this stands on its own and is better than most of what's out there at the moment. Another highlight for me is the closer &quot;Reservations&quot;. The songs are well written lyrically and enjoyable. Not the type of album you'd pop in your discman and walk around with but a nice album to just put on and get absorbed into. Well worth many listens.
B00007KWHP|5.0|In an earlier review, I urged Yes fans to buy the Japanese Mini-Sleeve version of this classic album, but with Rhino's release of Fragile, I recant that earlier review and say that this reissue of Fragile is the one to buy.<br />First of all, the sound is excellent, clear, clean, and deep. I can now hear everything in a complex Yes song such as Heart of the Sunrise. Even Rick Wakeman's semi-comatose contribution &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot; has some life in it.<br />The packaging surpasses the orginal gatefold. In this triple gatefold, all original artwork and album inserts are present, printed well, and despite their minature size, almost as good as the originals.  There are additional photographs from the time of the album which deepen the ambience of the era.<br />Included in the booklet is an essay by Yes fan Bill Martin who wrote a book on Yes and notes for the In A Word Package which gives his take on the music in the album and the evolution of the band. Whether or not you agree with Martin, he's knowlegable about the history of Yes, although his musical terminology is not particularly good.<br />The bonus tracks are &quot;America&quot; which is a Yes classic cover of a Paul Simon tune, one of the last they would commit to record, and a rough mix of &quot;Roundabout&quot; which adds little to the CD, but doesn't detract from it either.<br />The four Yes songs on this Album are certainly among the best the band produced, and, at least to me, The Heart of the Sunrise, is the best song in the Yes canon.  Written to emulate King Crimson's &quot;21st Century Schziod Man,&quot; Yes goes the classic one better, producing not a dystopic scream, but a storm, a calm, a meditation, a peace.  Shifting moods, arrangements, all the things Yes would do so well for the next few years are here in HOTS. Wakeman brought Yes to life even more that Steve Howe, not so much by his actual playing, but by showing Anderson how to structure work.<br />Bravo Rhino.
B00005RY7X|5.0|you gotta love this album<BR>water world to the fullest
B000092ZYX|4.0|There is always something refreshing when a new Radiohead album comes out. You can trust that in the new songs there will be interesting instrumentation, harmonies and melodies, lyrics that grab you by the balls, and enough techno-babble to keep the songs spontaneous and intriguing. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is not missing any of these points, but there are detractors to its glory. If anything, this album is more \\"cut + paste\\" than any of their previous works. It's clear that Radiohead have defined a style for themselves now, but the songs don't seem to have that clear inspiration or heart-wrenching sadness their other albums had. Can't blame them, though. Supposedly most of this album is a reaction of the political situation of the world and the war in Iraq. The general concensus is ignorance and disshevelment. There is no glory. It's just a weird, raw time. Radiohead are taking that attitude and smushing it in our face, beating us over the head with just how stupid all this is. So, they sacrifice a couple inspiring melodies and drama, but they hit hard with social commentary.<br />\\"2+2=5\\", a 1984 reference, is nothing short of brilliance, lyrically and musically. Thom Yorke sings absently about allowing things that shouldn't be, to be (\\"January has April showers,\\" or more realistically, letting a thief keep his reign as president), and just as he realizes how wrong it is to do that, he sings, \\"...but it's too late now, BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION!\\" and literally yells \\"paying attention\\" over and over. It's a great moment when the band kicks in and they rock out. They've listened to the critics who said they forgot how to rock and show em all they still got it. It's a perfect way to start the album.<br />When asked what the new album would sound like (and this is before the unauthorized advance MP3 leak), the band said it would be a mix between their new and old stuff. Like The Bends meets Amnesiac. This is incredibly true. In fact, if you listen enough, you can section out which songs sound like rejects from previous albums. Take tracks like \\"Go to Sleep\\", \\"Scatterbrain\\", and \\"I Will.\\" They are much more melodic and atmospheric in sound than most of the other songs, which is what The Bends was all about. \\"Where I End and You Begin\\", \\"Backdrifts\\", and \\"The Gloaming\\" with their open-air composition can be traced to the Kid A/Amnesiac days, and \\"Sail to the Moon\\" could easily have slipped into OK Computer without you noticing with its dreamy texture.<br />What makes this album a complete package, however, are the songs that are not linked to any past albums, and present a new, focused sound. \\"2+2=5\\" is a good example of this, but the best track to ponder is \\"There There.\\" A good choice for a first single, There is so much rhythm in this song with the excess drums, the guitars are loud and omnipresent, as is Yorke's enigmatic voice, and they all work together to make so much of a new musical direction, it's hard to put to words. Just like the other tracks, the song picks up in the middle, and goes to a great, loud climax. Other such new blends are \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\", \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", \\"Myxomatosis\\", and \\"A Punchup at a Wedding.\\"<br />This album also closes nicely with the momentary weirdness of \\"A Wolf at the Door.\\" It was a shock when I first heard this song, because the music is so light and carefree, but the lyrics are incredibly dark. It's quite comedic as well when Yorke nearly freestyles his lines. The incongruity of it all is perfect, albeit a really weird listen the first time around.<br />It's not necessary to know of Radiohead's history before listening to this album, but it certainly does help if you have trouble stomaching it all down. It's an album that reflects musically on the band's past and shows their plan for the future while the lyrics focus on what a weirdly unstable time period the new century has become. I think the most appropriate word to describe everything about this album is \\"unstable,\\"but as weird as it sounds, there has never been more stability in their music, their words, and their grasp of where the world is right now.
0800141806|5.0|I cried during this movie. I'm not usually moved by films but this did it in such a profound way. Should be apart of everyone's DVD collection.
B00005B4GU|2.0|It is hard for me to give a truly meaningful review on this album.  I was just beginning to become a Radiohead fan at the time of purchasing this album.  I had become quite a fan after listening to OK Computer and had the intentions of looking deeper into this band, so a went out to aquire this album.  I'm sorry I did.  I put this Cd into my player once.  That was one too many times.  Ever since then I have not purchased another Radiohead album and do not have the ambition or the drive to seek another.  Don't be fooled, as I was.  That is all.  Thank you.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It took me a week of listening to the cd over and over again to really enjoy it - now I can't stop listening to it!  I promise if you give it time you will love it too.
B0000042MY|5.0|The music of this movie is one of the things I love best.  Why it wasn't nominated for an Oscar doesn't make sense.  While listening to it, I'm drawn right into the story.  Wonderful!!
B000065VA1|4.0|This is Gabriel's first thoroughly Yuppie-Friendly album &amp; though meticulously crafted, a definite step-down from all 4 previous albums. The weirdness &amp; bizarre elements that made his first four masterpiece albums so dangerous (and they're all masterpieces with 3 &amp; Security being the peak period)is toned down towards sentimental overstatements like &quot;Red Rain&quot; &amp; &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; infectiously silly but quite shallow hit tracks like &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; &amp; &quot;Big Time&quot; ( rather than awesomely nutcase ones like &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; &amp; &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;) &amp; the album would get only 3 stars if not for great 3 track combination of That Voice Again, In Your Eyes &amp; Mercy Street &amp;  the great &quot;We Do What We're Told Milgram's 37&quot; that comes after the annoying distraction of the loud &amp; funky &quot;Big Time.&quot;
B00008AWOD|2.0|After Without You I'm Nothing and Black Market Music I was really looking forward to Sleeping With Ghosts.  Unfortunately I was very dissappointed with Placebo's latest.  The lyrics are incredibly repetitive, it feels rushed.  There was definitely a lack of creativity on this album...hopefully the next is better...
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is very fresh. This dark driven band meets all the mind setting goals that you can handle. Great sounds and moods. They get they're point across. Very art driven.  Smart Love it
0316666343|4.0|A unique book... compelling, compassionate and yet thrilling.  It's a strange and wonderful combination.  A quick read, certainly worth it!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I had never heard of The White Stripes before yesterday. I was listening to our local public radio station and they played &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; and I loved it! It had a &quot;feel&quot; to it that didn't sound like anything I had heard in a long time. So I Went out to various web music sites and listened to tracks from all of their CDs - these guys are great! They don't sound like anybody. They don't seem to be trying to be the latest Kurt Cobain grunge band (which everyone seems to want to do these days). White Stripes have their own style and sound, and it varies considerably from album to album and even from song to song. I've seen comparisons of various songs to various bands, but most are reminiscent of no one in particular. That's what I love about White Stripes - they do what they want and they play what they want and you never know what style of music they'll play on the next track or next album. The early albums sound pretty raw, but I like that - there aren't a lot of fancy studio tricks to make it sound better. &quot;Elephant&quot; sounds like the studio spent more time making it sound good and, to me, doesn't sound as raw as the earlier albums, but I think it's every bit as good as the previous albums. Its hard to say that one album is better than another - they're all great and all different.<BR>Even if you grew up on classic rock from the 70's and 80's (like me), I still think you'll like these albums.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I can see that I've already been beaten to the punch by some of the other reviewers in pointing out what an incredibly diverse and eclectically influenced record the new TMV album is, so why beat a dead horse? This is far and away, the album of the year, due to the fact that it delivers on every level. The musicianship of everyone involved on the record is top notch, from Cedric's highly evolved vocals, to Omar's frenetic 21st century guitar heroics, to the blitzkrieg drumming and percussion, to the seamless effects and interludes that sew it all together.  <br />I can gush for hours on how exciting and invigorating the sounds are on this record, but what gets me almost as pumped up is the amount of respect I have for Cedric and Omar, the At the Drive-In vets who comprise the nucleus of this group.  Less than 3 years ago, ATDI blew me away with the intensity of their live performance at many a small show in the NYC area. When they announced that they were parting ways at what seemed like the pinnacle of the band's creative career to pursue projects outside the realm of post-hardcore (or however one chooses to inadequately pigeonhole ATDI's sound), I assumed they had opted to quit while they were ahead. I would have never suspected that Omar dissolved the band in order to pursue a project that could ever top ATDI. What a ballsy move! But this album is just that. It incorporates EVERYTHING the guys did before, including hardcore intensity, emotive vocals, frenetic rhythms, and even the sampler driven effects that used to fill up the space between songs in an ATDI set, melds it into something much more, and never looks back.<br />Enough with the comparisons, though. The past is the past, and The Mars Volta are now. Listening to this record in my friend's backyard yesterday evening, for the 10th or 11th time so far, what really sent chills down my spine is how huge this album is going to be, and how many music fans are going to be floored by this that don't know it yet.To date, The Mars Volta are still an underground phenomena of sorts, and the only people eagerly anticipating this record were those who were fans of ATDI or had heard the Tremulant EP. This will all change very soon. Whether it's a good thing or not, The Mars Volta are going to make a major impact on the state of mainstream rock. This record will probably sell over a million copies, and even though record sales don't translate into musical quality in the least, they do translate into how many sets of ears an album will reach and how many lives it will influence. I can easily see De-Loused in the Comatorium being as big as alternative milestones such as Ritual de lo Habitual, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, or OK Computer. As screwed up as the music machine may be, every so often a release such as this comes along that is so undeniably extreme, refreshing, visionary, and artistically realized that it defies the forces that feed garbage like American Idol, reality TV, boy bands, and pop divas to the art-famished masses. This record is going to explode. Just you wait and see.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'll start off by saying was a big fan of At The Drive-In's &quot;Relationship Of Command&quot;. When ATDI split into two factions, I couldn't wait to hear both groups. One one hand there was Sparta, who's &quot;Wiretap Scars&quot; was not quite as experimental as ATDI, and boasted more radio-friendly songs. The Mars Volta however, released a 3-song EP, containing 3 odd and experimental tracks. However this did not discourage me from looking forward to a full-length album from them. After seeing them open for the Chili Peppers on their North American tour, I knew these guys had some serious potential. They put on a great stage show, yet unfortunately they did not win over the crowd.<BR>Despite this, I picked up their new album as soon as I could.<BR>Simply put, this album is easily better than both &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; and &quot;Wiretap Scars&quot;. Ever song is a totally unique and an interesting musical experience in itself. The vocals are terrific, and have improved much from the days of ATDI. The guitar jams, reminiscent of Santana on tracks like &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot; and &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; are incredible. the drumwork is superb (and is great to see live). Flea, as always, is amazing on the bass, and offers a lot of neat riffs on the album. John Frusciante's guest appearance on &quot;Cicatriz&quot; is also amazing. There's also some interesting sound effect interludes which may remind you of Pink Floyd or Edgar Winters. To put it short, this album is a modern masterpiece.<br />If you're in for a blend of classic rock like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Santana, along with latin, reggae, and obvious At The Drive-in and Fugazi influences, buy this album now. You will not regret it.
B000069CWE|5.0|The interesting thing about this album was not that it was a remix of old songs, but Linkin Park seemed to be able to take many songs that were &quot;deep&quot; or very meaningful and accentuate what was already moving in the music. One of those tracks was KRWLNG. The mix of Chester's emotion and background vocals of Aaron Lewis enhanced its already moving feeling. This seems to be a common re-occurrence on this album. I like it even more every time I hear it. If you're like remixed songs and are a fan of Linkin Park this is a good cd for you.
B00009V7RF|4.0|I've purchased every BEP album thus far and Elephunk is hands down the best product the L.A. quartet (previously a trio) has put out.  The last two albums were pretty hit or miss as far as song quality.  \\"Joints and Jam\\" and \\"Weekends,\\" were my previous favorites; and \\"Request Line\\" had some backing by BET and various radio stations across the continental U.S., but personally it was the message they brought that spoke volumes above the music they created.  The previous albums just didn't captivate me to spin them non-stop.   Contrarily, Elephunk is a near non-stop spinning piece of musical monument. <br />I saw them live for the first time at the \\"Justified and Stripped\\" tour at the Staples center on June 20th.  BEP opened and put out more energy and soul then Justin or Christina-and why not???  They have nothing to lose but everything to gain?  <br />I absolutely recommend seeing them live.  They emit so much intensity, equally matching a stellar performance-and with a backup band that talented (more like off the hook), you can't go wrong.  The teeny boppers were not feeling it like I was. It was a REAL hip-hop show, not for the young at heart or the occassional hip hop listener.<br />The new album again echos a message contary to the streets.  This is no \\"platinum plus\\" hip hop joint.  No shoot 'em up anthems, not many galactic sounds or over priced producing.  It's quality music that instantly puts you in a good mood and an album where you can hear the heart and soul of the artists (don't seem to have many hip hop albums like that nowadays).  Elephunk is great, but if you are fortunate enough to hear it live you will find it infinitely better.  A studio record hinders their true talent, performing!<br />So enough babble, right??  What are the best songs you ask??  Before I get to spittin', I can honestly say I like more than half of the album.  I can do without \\"anxiety\\" and \\"boogie that be,\\" but anyways here are the prime cuts:<br />Love 'em (in no particular order)<BR>1) Hands up<BR>3) Let's Get Retarded (the best song they perform live<BR>9) Fly Away (Fergie at her best)<BR>14) Elephunk, the hidden track (Fergie doin' her thing again)<br />Like 'em (in order of preference)<BR>7) Latin Girls<BR>5) Shut Up<BR>13) Where is the Love (chorus is the best part of course)<BR>2) Labor Day (it's a holiday)<BR>4) Hey Mama<BR>11) The APL Song (only for the message though and because it REPS THE FILIPINOS!!)<br />This is an ablum you will not be disappointed with if you're into this particular genre of hip hop.  It falls great on ear drums and stimulates good feelings and creativity.  Great work BEP!  I'm looking forward to watching and hearing you flourish.
B00005UEAR|5.0|The musicianship on this album blows the socks off of almost any band on the market today, with the exception of a few, which are ranked on the same plane as them. This band is the reason I started to play guitar, namely John Petrucci. Every album that they produce is, and always will be an inspiration for me to play hard and better. Any person that does give this album a bad review, its like I said in the title, I'd like to see you play this. So I would just like to say thanks to the band, and buy this album along with every other one, it is highly recommened.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Several of the user-contributed reviews for \\"Chicago\\" make it sound like the film (and the original play and earlier works they're based on) is a treatise on the virtues of sex and liquor.<br />In fact, in one way, it is. It's a commentary on how we, society, respond to celebrity and media manipulation.<br />The first time we see the lawyer, we hear him sing about how money means nothing to him (while he's being measured for custom suits, riding in expensive cars, and having beautiful women draped over him as part of the choreography for the song). Clearly, the visuals tell us, he's a manipulator.<br />Both female leads, excellently cast (although I would entertain arguments for others in the roles, these are fine examples of the craft), are similar manipulators. The brunette murders her lover and sister (who is also her partner in her stage act) and then boasts, later, that they \\"had it comin'.\\" The blond murders her lover and then, having convinced her husband to take the fall for her, sings a ballad about how faithful he is and how much she loves him - until he realizes (about verse three of the song) that she's been two-timing him and rats her out. (I took my 63-year-old mother to see this, and she started laughing at that moment.) Mid-ballad, she changes her tune (literally) and starts singing about how disloyal he is.<br />\\"Chicago\\" is not endorsing these creeps. It's telling us that we have a voyeuristic need to follow their stories, to be entertained by the media instead of being informed by it. Certainly, you cannot see \\"Chicago\\" without acknowledging some of the grime in our world, and in ourselves.<br />It's called \\"art\\".<br />The visual style of \\"Chicago\\" deliberately pulls you in, as \\"Cabaret\\" did, by putting [nearly] all the numbers into a night-club setting so that people don't just spontaneously break into song. (That's one the big complaints about old-time musicals that I hear, and Chicago/Cabaret can't be accused of having nuns on hill-tops breaking into song.)<br />It is a great film, even if it's a bit uncomfortable in places. (A press conference scene feels almost as frightening as a debate in Bullworth in which the title character points out that the press is in the entertainment business.)g into song.)<br />It is a great film, even if it's a bit uncomfortable in places.

055357342X|5.0|Comparing Mr. Martin to terry goodkind, robert jordan and even Tolkien is like comparing filet mignon to hot dogs(without any condiments). This is fantasy for grownups! The negative reviews are probably from all the jordanites and goodkinds. Not enough trolls or orks or other such silly things I guess.
B00005JLO2|1.0|An astonishing mix of great and terrible photography. Painfully slow moving. It starts off OK and then doesn't seem to know when it should have ended.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I love the DVD set, but where's the rest of the Earls Court footage?<br />That was such a brilliant concert, why only a segment of the concerts (5 shows in all) were played there.<br />I have heard most of the show and I know it exsists.<br />Appart from that its a great DVD set.<br />Let's hope a Jimi Hendrix,Who,Allman Brothers Band etc DVD will come out the same as this
B000099T2L|5.0|Blessed with one of the most expressive and powerful voices in the modern pop music, Beyonce was born to be a 'solo' star. The thing I love most about this album is the old school vibes Beyonce has incorporated into all 15 songs (that includes the hidden bonus track 'Daddy'). Even the funky first single 'Crazy in Love' adds a healthy dose of 70's groove to it's modern hip-hop base. The beautiful ballad 'Speechless' definitely has 60's soul written all over it. Club cuts like 'Naughty Girl' and the Middle Eastern flavored 'Baby Boy' show Beyonce at her dance floor finest. Of course, 'The Closer I Get To You' with Luther Vandros has got to be one of the most soulful duets in years. They may be generations apart, but Beyonce and Luther compliment eachother beautifully. Anyone who appreciates well crafted music with a lot of soul and a genuine creative touch will love &quot;DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE.&quot;
B000000H3W|4.0|if you like thrash metal(like myself), you will probably like this one, also check out their \\"chaos a.d.\\", wich is not as thrashy as this one, but its even more heavy<BR>then this one, and if you like death metal, try out morbid angel's \\"blessed are the sick\\", or obituary's \\"slowly we rot\\".
B000005IU2|5.0|I first heard this record when i was 15, i am now 34 and this is the best music i ever heard. each track follows on perfectly from the last, with no dud tracks at all. to me its like being on the best waltzer drinking the smoothest tequila, being spun round by lithe, muscular be-vested spanish men. if you can hear it on vinyl, do try as it sounds quite different. <br />Whip it out!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I had waited many months for this album, and it's so rewarding when it's better than you could ever imagine it being. I wouldn't be exaggerating when I say that this is not only the best release of 2003, but also one of the best works of progressive rock in general to date. Omar and Cedric have solidified their uniqueness as musicians and it would appear that in tandem to Omar's seemingly endless creativity, Cedric's voice has reached an entirely new dimension of range and emotion. Songs like Drunkship For Lantern will make you dance with its rythmic beats and unebelievable harmonies, while songs such as Televators will simply make you cry because of the amazing wave of power it gives off. In a world of 7s and 8s, this album is an obvious 10.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is a simply wonderful movie, it is extremely original, deep, and unexpected. I only wish the movie industry would have the courage to explore more themes so original.<BR>All actors deserve a 5 stars, Drew Barrymore was simply wonderful for the part and acting it out. I am not a particular fan for her look, but in this movie she is incredibly intriguing.<BR>The remake of the song \\"Mad World\\" slow motion played at the end, has completely reached its peak of perfection. I believe \\"Tears for Fears\\", being themselves great artists, would share my opinion about it.<BR>Great movie!!!!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I grew up listening to the Cure, Joy Division, Siouxsie, etc. When I heard &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights,&quot; I was blown away, not only is this a beautiful and melodic album, but it gave me reassurance that those great &quot;goth&quot; bands of the 80's have not been forgotten, but have influenced bands like Interpol. I just wish there were more like them out there.
B000099T2L|1.0|I am just gonna make this review short and not very sweet unfortunately....<br />The CD is a waste of money unless you feel like buying a album with one good song on it which is the first single &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;...Honestly the rest of the CD is a joke. NONE of the songs are like or as good as &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;<br />I mean Beyonce has a powerful voice and all but the songs are just really bad..not too many catchy tunes and not really worth it..Nice try Beyonce!<br />I reccommend Monica's &quot;After the Storm&quot; Album or the Not yet released Mya's &quot;MoodRing&quot; Album.
0446608955|5.0|I just loved this book, the movie does it no justice, the story if so heartfelt, the characters so real, just an all out wonderful book that i feel everyone would enjoy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This Album is simply FANTASTIC. It is so good, I can't even find the words to describe it. Christina has one of the most amazing and beautiful voices I have ever heard in my lifetime. And now with her album, \\"Stripped\\" she is finally starting to grow up. Every single track on Stripped shows how much mature and focused Christina has become. She has such versatility singing so many genre's of Music with such passion and emotion. Christina has her R&B/soulful tracks,rock,pop,beautiful ballads, and HOT BEATS especially with the Hit Single DIRRTY!!<br />Don't let her image fool you. Christina is a star and despite her provocative look, it gives her a unique style and presence that no one ever over-looks. When Christina is around..EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING!!<br />Give this Album The Chance is deserves..When I say it is a Masterpiece I truly mean it and this is coming from someone that was NOT a big fan of the Pop Era and the artists in it. Britney might as well not even try and make a comeback after the work Christina did..lol!
B000099T2L|4.0|I've always been a DC fan..and when i heard beyonce was going to have a solo cd..i had to buy it! So it was no surprise i bought the cd the day it came out. My favorite songs on the cd..would have to be &quot;thats how you like it&quot;w/ jay-z and &quot;baby boy&quot; w/ sean paul. they are great..and of course i love &quot;dangerously in love&quot; sure it was on dc's survivor cd..but hey..she wrote it and she's proud of it! overall the cd keeps the tempo up, it makes me wanna get up and dance!
B00008OWZC|5.0|One of the best live documents I've ever heard, and light years ahead of that dreary piece of garbage Zep released in the 70s as a souvenir. Jimmy Page has more inventive ideas in 2.5 hours on these disks then he has had in the last 20 years. Put one of these discs in your car, one in your home, and one for the gym so you will always be ready to listen to the sounds of men making music!<br />The best part - no liner notes! Beethoven didn't need liner notes so why do bands feel the need to include some self-serving blathering the length of a DF Wallace novel? Page keeps it short and sweet. The only minor quibble is that JP Jones is a bit down in the mix.
B000002JS6|4.0|Many people consider Back in Black to be AC/DC greatest masterpiece. I beg to differ. While Back in Black is probably the finest album of the Brian Johnson era, the first 6 albums AC/DC did with Bon Scott on vocals cannot be touched by Brian Johnson. This album was released after the tragic death of Bon Scott, as sort of a tribute to him. But not a tribute in the fashion of slow, mournful, sickeningly melodramtic songs that bands seem to often do when they lose a member, but in the same hard-edged pure-rock format in which AC/DC has always lived. But you can begin to tell by listening to songs like \\"Have a Drink on Me\\" that they are honoring their late great lead singer, but in the way that made them great: hard rock. Now, on to the songs themselves.<br />Hells Bells: Slowish by AC/DC standards, but still a decent hard rocker, and the forboding gonging of the church bell at the beginning is an excellent touch, 4/5<br />Shoot to Thrill: Typical rocker in AC/DC's style, a song that a number of later Johnson-era AC/DC songs would come to sound like rehashed versions of, 3.8/5<br />What Do You Do For Money Honey: This song sounds a bit like typical AC/DC rockers, with a few positive twists. Sounds a bit like the song Let's Get it Up on For Those About to Rock (We Salute You), but still fairly good, 3.5/5<br />Givin' the Dog a Bone: See review of Shoot to Thrill above, 3.7/5<br />Let Me Put My Love Into You: See review of What Do You Do For Money Honey above, 3.2/5<br />Back in Black: Title track of the album, but by no means bad. This song sounds more hip-hop influenced than any rock song I've ever heard, but in this case it's surprisingly not a bad thing. True this doesn't sound like typical AC/DC, but it is still enjoyable, 4/5<br />You Shook Me All Night Long: Even people who don't know much about AC/DC have probably heard this song at one point or another, and it, along with T.N.T., has become a kind of trademark song for AC/DC. Although I am resentful that many people would come to associate AC/DC with a post-Bon Scott song, it is undeniable that this is a well-written song, and all I can say is that it is a good thing that Malcom and Angus Young stayed with the band after Bon's death to co-write more music, because god only knows what would have happened to AC/DC without them, either, 4.7/5<br />Have a Drink on Me: Though still fairly covert in it's meanings, this is the most blatant tribute to Bon Scott on the album. Even though it is Brian Johnson on vocals, it is still an homage to Bon, and a pretty well written one, with Angus Young's riffs carrying it on, 4/5<br />Shake a Leg: Another typical-style AC/DC rocker, but with a killer guitar solo by Angus Young in the middle, 4.5/5<br />Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution: Written when noise pollution was becoming an issue in the U.K. and people were trying to put more bans and restrictions on music, this is a great song, and a very decent rocker, mostly because the message to the FCC-type authorities is just \\"up yours, our music is staying the same\\", 4.4/5<br />Though many of the Bon Scott-era fans of AC/DC (including myself) don't care for Brian Johnson too much, one has to admit that he is still a good singer, and that he was probably the next-best singer to Bon Scott for AC/DC. And even if you still don't like the idea of him as singer, this album is well worth the money just for the legendary, killer riffs of Angus Young alone. If you want the best AC/DC album ever, though, get Highway to Hell.
B00005IC2H|5.0|That's all I have to say because that's what I like the most about this CD, the different sounds they make. They play with guitar and synthesizer textures well and aren't always doing that. Sometimes they settle for the straight up piano and that's well done too. An adventurous soundtrack almost. PS: they sing in Icelandic so you can't understand the details of what they're singing about
0142004235|5.0|I've read books by Steinbeck before this one. Actually, now that I think about, I read a quite a lot by him. But none of them hit me like &quot;East of Eden.&quot; I think he was truly at his best when he decided to write &quot;East of Eden.&quot; The characters are fascinating, and the way he seems to tie several different sub-plots together is absolutely amazing. His other books like &quot;The Pearl&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; showed that he was a good author. But &quot;East of Eden&quot; shows that not only is he an extraordinary writer, he has gift for portraying human relationships skillfully. Truly, his use of character interactions is astounding. And each character is wonderfully full and complete, lending a multi-faceted quality to his book.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's nice to hear Mort Crim's voice again, and surprising to hear Meg White sing a few tunes on this one. I've listened to and own three White Stripes albums and this one holds up well in comparison.  It's more diverse than their last album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; and gets into a steadier more rockin groove. I look forward to more and I'm interested in where they'll go from here.
B00008G9JO|5.0|My daughter loves the smell of farms, horses and saddles. Heavy Horses is the audio version of those smells. Put on the CD, close your eyes and enjoy a slice of the country life. From the stalking acoustics of \\"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps\\" (one of my favorite Tull songs), which just purrs right along, to the joyous celebration of life and love which fiddles around in the dance of \\"Acres Wild\\" this album explores all the beauty and wonder of the simple life. Late night bedtime stories of beasties and the like which roam those fields of dreams stalk the listener in \\"No Lullaby,\\" while the fable recounting the folly of the moth and the flame flutters by in the gentle acoustic setting of Moths. The shuffling gait of \\"Journeyman\\" intrudes into this world, rocking back on it's heels and kicking up a little country dust, followed quickly by the breezy \\"Rover,\\" which roams this open countryside in carefree fashion. \\"One Brown Mouse\\" is a poetic observation of mice and men and their likewise treadmill existence's, written with loving tribute to it's inspiration. Dramatically raising its head in epic proportions, the records namesake is a beast unto itself. \\"Heavy Horses\\" is not only the standout track on the record, it is a Jethro Tull classic and rightly so. The song plows into the very soul that lives within any resistance against the inevitable changes of an ever-changing world, but whose values and truths refuse to die. I see the song as a kind of an analogy of Punk and Disco verses the old classic Rock. Music was changing for the worst at the time, but Jethro Tull remained clinging stubbornly (thankfully) to the stuff that really mattered: great music over poor trends. Weathering the storm of Disco and Punk to find a better day on the other side might also be seen in what was the closing song on the record: \\"Weathercock\\" (another favorite of mine). This song is redone quite well on the more recent Jethro Tull Christmas Album. Both versions are great but I actually prefer the more recent version somewhat. However they are both excellent. The bonus track is \\"Broadford Bazaar\\" which is a good song but is also available on the Nightcap CD. Still it fits in well enough here. There's a bit more sparkle in the acoustics on this new remaster making it worth owning even if you have the old one. Saddle up and take a ride and this disc will take you places you've only read about in the farmer's almanac.
B000094A6A|3.0|It's got a few funny parts, but when I saw it in the theater, I was bored in the first half.  I was wishing I had watched &quot;About Schmidt&quot; instead.  Much of the storyline doesn't fit.  No college would ever let a non-student in a fraternity/sorority.  Why do it in &quot;Old School&quot;?  Had this movie been real life, the dean would have been fired ages ago.  His superiors would be way too stupid not to catch him.  With the acting, I've seen Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson perform better, but it's not his fault.  It's bad directing.  Will Ferrell is same ole, same ole.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Okay, don't even listen to the people giving this album any fewer stars than this because they have no clue what rock music means.  This album expresses every tone and every vibe and feeling of WHAT ROCK IS SUPPOSED TO BE! Unlike the meaningless [stuff] put out there by many other artists, CREED puts everything in them into every song, and the album leaves you feeling satisfied wherever you are and whatever you're doing. This album will not let you down, you just need to LISTEN TO IT. They are three (in this album four I guess) very talented artists that deserve respect and if this doesn't convince you, SEE THEM LIVE! (to see what I'm REALLY talking about) <BR>Creed is THE BEST THING to ever happen to the music industry and will leave their lasting imprint no matter what you think...<BR>...
B00009V7T2|5.0|Being a native El Pasoan I've seen the guys from Sparta and Mars Volta evolve musically since the early nineties.<BR>In my Opinion The El paso scene had reached a raucous peak in about 1993 with such incredibly talented bands as The Left Overs, Bandulu Station, and in the midst of such talent there stood a band named Los Dregtones, fronted by Cedric Bixler (The front man from Mars volta and ATDI). In fact 2/3, of the members of Sparta and Mars volta have been contributers to the El Paso scene for over a decade.  <BR>  Cedric's band, Los Dregttones, was a cut above anything I have ever experienced, and I was convinced that this band was on the verge of changing the face of rock.  The band had the capacity of monster rock bands to the likings of Pink floyd and Led zepllin, with the modern intensity of fugazi and blonde redhead.<BR>  It was not until At the Drive-in that these ultra talented guys were finaly on the map. <BR>  Though it is almost sacreligious for me to say this (being from El Paso), I never felt that ATDI ever compared to the potential of it's member's talent.  <BR>  The music of ATDI was undoubtedly something very different and undeniably intense, But the songs seemed to have a mechanical, almost post apocolyptic feeling, that left you with a feeling of emptiness.<BR> Now with the realease of the new Mars Volta Album, these guys have re-established their mamoth in your face, monster rock sound that is destined to become classic.<BR>  While Sparta have some good stuff to offer, they seem to have taken the safer \\"emo\\"-genre route; The Mars Volta on the other hand have created a potentially timeless Uber album that avoids the confines of any single genre.  <BR> It is musicians like Mars Volta, Defacto,  Black heart Procession, John Frusciante, and Built to spill (just to mention a few),  that  can still delve into psychadelic mood rock in a world of unbearable teen angst Nu-metal and horrifically cheesy \\"pop punk\\".  <BR>  Please don't miss out on this band!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I just don't understand those who can actually compare Sparta with the Mars Volta!  True, Sparta made a good album that I undoubtedly bought and enjoyed....but... the Mars Volta's &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; is a vast, strong expression of music that is so far ahead of the curve in modern music that it just wouldn't make sense to compare them to their contemporaries.<br />Let me say this before I go on...<BR>&quot;ROULETTE DARES&quot; is so good that the chorus alone has been keeping me from sleeping soundly this last week!  It repeats through my head over and over!!<br />That being said, this is an exceptional album of art-punk.  That's right, this album will not, I repeat, NOT be found on your radio dial.  It is not an easily accessible sound.  It is a newly evolved sound that is completely unique and profound, full of jagged rhythms and dischordant melodies.  They sound like a modern Fugazi mixed with...oh, I dunno, Portishead, maybe.  Maybe something more like Jawbox.  I don't know, it's all too complicated and wonderful for me to describe.<br />This will be the blueprint of modern punk rock, mark my words.  This is the new manifesto.<br />Adios,<BR>J
B000099T2L|4.0|Good CD! I was actually a little caught off-guard at first, but the songs have a way of staying with you and growing on you.  I was hoping this CD would be a depature from the Destiny's Child stuff, and it is. The music sounds less commerical and more creative than what I've heard of Destiny's Child.<br />Beyonce covers a wide range of styles with ease. From dancehall, to standard R&amp;B, the girl can do it all.  A Gospel or Latin influenced song would have really capped the set of nicely, but there is still a good mixture here.<br />Vocally, she's never sounded better than on &quot;Be With You&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; with Luther Vandross.  For someone of her age (21) to be able to hold her own with Luther is no small achievement.  And she wrote most of the material here, which is also quite an accomplishment.<br />In short, this is a great debut from a promising young singer.  I think she's miles ahead of most of her peers.  She has the voice, the songwriting skills, and incredible stage presence/ command.  Viva la diva (in-training)!
B00008YLV2|5.0|Well the truth about it, is I preordered the first DVD before it was released. This is after I saw the movie and the theater and it still effects me the same way as the first movie. You have to remember, however, I lived through Somalia during this time that was depicted. I lost friends to a landmine attack in August and stuff went downhill from there.  <BR>Some of the critics that I read here lambasted the gore adn the lack of a plot line. Well guess what? Once the bullets started to fly for real everything went out the window and you relied on the person next to you.  That is what this movie tried to show. The biggest thing I gave as a detractor was the location.  Actual wires still on power polls, windows intact on buildings, etc. And the setup of the airport was all wrong, however unless you were there, as I was you wouldn't be able to pick up those small problems.  Along with &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; this is probably hands down the best movie on warfare and the best on modern dirty warfare that hollywood has produced.
B000099T2L|4.0|Good CD! I was actually a little caught off-guard at first, but the songs have a way of staying with you and growing on you.  I was hoping this CD would be a depature from the Destiny's Child stuff, and it is. The music sounds less commerical and more creative than what I've heard of Destiny's Child.<br />Beyonce covers a wide range of styles with ease. From dancehall, to standard R&amp;B, the girl can do it all.  A Gospel or Latin influenced song would have really capped the set of nicely, but there is still a good mixture here.<br />Vocally, she's never sounded better than on &quot;Be With You&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; with Luther Vandross.  For someone of her age (21) to be able to hold her own with Luther is no small achievement.  And she wrote most of the material here, which is also quite an accomplishment.<br />In short, this is a great debut from a promising young singer.  I think she's miles ahead of most of her peers.  She has the voice, the songwriting skills, and incredible stage presence/ command.  Viva la diva (in-training)!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Every one keeps trying to compare this release to those of At the Drive-in.  I have become severly annoyed by this and wish all of you to let go of the great vision that once was.  Sure, I was a fan too, but when you listen to this superb album, you have to hear it with a very open mind.  This is not like anything you have heard before and you have to accept that, or else it will definatly fall short of your expectations.  No, there's not much of the attitude that defined their former band and continues to drive Sparta.  But just let go to your inner thirst for something new.  These guys pour their hearts out for you, at least give them a chance.  Buy this not based on their members past, but because it is an amazing achievment in the world of music as we know it.
B000002C25|4.0|Not so long before this album came out, Oasis were praised for there Pop hooks, over crunching guitars, with a pinch of infectious lyricsm. And this album has it all, so what was the problem. Well it seems there arrogance and slating of other artist was getting to people. Which is a shame for this album is worth much praise. From the arrogant snare of Liam's voice, to Noel's clever and sometimes vague lyrics. Your marvel at the music. Sure the lyics don't make much sense sometimes, but who cares. It's just music. &quot;D'ya Know What I Mean&quot; opens the album with a brash stare of cockiness only Oasis could pull off. &quot;Step off the train all alone at dawn/Back in to hole where I was born&quot; are the first lines uttered from Liam's lips, and right then and there you feel a rush of adrenaline. And for 7 and a half minutes your mesmerized by walls of guitars and useless sound effects (but you couldn't care less). The album contiues the trend of loud guitars and &quot;What the hell?&quot; lyrics with songs like &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; and pretty much the rest of the album. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;All Around The World&quot; shows the anthemetic genius Noel at work. You find yourself humming it or singing the song in your head an hour later. Which is what Oasis is for. But the real show stopper is &quot;Don't Go Away&quot;. A heart wrenching song written for Liam's and Noel's mother who was ill (She's fine now). Lines like &quot;Danm my education/I can't find the words to say/For all the things caught in my mind&quot; are probably the most touching things Noel has ever wrote.<br />So take my word if you wish. Get the album, stomp your feet to it, sing it agian later in you head, and enjoy it. It's just a danm good time.<br />P.S.<BR>These are b-sides that I believe are worthy of the album, but didn't make it:<BR>(I Got)The Fever<BR>Stay Young<BR>The Fame<BR>Flashbax

B00006RIO7|5.0|I loved the movie so much that I didn't see any other until it was hard to find in theaters, so it would only be expected for me to buy the soundtrack two days after I saw Chicago the first time. Not too extreme considering a buddy of mine stopped to get it on the way home. If you liked the movie you must get the CD and the movie itself when it is released. I, too, agree that the last two tracks need not have been added, they are just an annoyance if you want to switch the mode of listening to &quot;repeat all&quot;. Everything else on the disk is wonderful, though this might also be because I have always liked this type of jazz and music from musicals. I found myself liking the instrumental tracks and sections of other tracks better now that I could hear the outstanding quality of the music. &quot;After Midnight&quot; is the most beautiful thing I've heard in a while, it's almost a shame it was only background for the film (it's the part where Billy tells of the murdering heiress Kitty). There are very, very few minor differences between the content as heard in the movie and the content on the CD. If you were considering buying this go ahead -- if you enjoyed listening to the music in the cinema you must love being able to listen to it any time, or all of the time! Just try to pry that disk out of my stereo! It won't happen!
B00008I8IF|5.0|This is the best album to come along in years. If you are at all into alt-country, you've got to check this out. Instant classic in my book. Plus, you get the superb 6-track bonus disc. There's some great versions of old and new songs on there.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was a huge Soundgarden fan, and was pretty bummed out when Chris Cornell left.  When I heard he was joining the remaining Rage Against the Machine members (the talented ones), I was psyched!  The finished product, is one of the best albums put out by any group in the last 5-10 years.  Almost every song is catchy in its own way, and Tom Morello's Hendrix-like guitar work is unmatched by anyone in the industry today.  I look forward to many more (hopefully) albums from this supergroup.
0316921173|5.0|if you are addicted to reading and essentially finishing books of a slightly skewed bent then welcome, the book is thick and painful (to carry around at least), but a joy to read, the vocabulary is turned on itself as is every character of the book and the reader, just finishing the book itself makes you wonder if you're addicted to reading feeding your own disease as the book might say, or trying to finish the book to continue to be entertained despite the time you'll lose from your life just to finish it...but if none of the above phase you much...read and enjoy, i highly recommend reading hamlet or rereading and considering infinite jest in context of hamlet...it makes for fun thoughts...
B000099T2L|3.0|I have always been a Destiny's Child fan and despite all their legal troubles i've never faulted Beyonce for what happend with the other group members.  I was very excited when I heard she would be doing a solo project and had all confidence that she would create a CD with nothing but hot songs.  I bought this release the same day it hit the stores and to my surprise the CD is filled with mellow tunes.  Nothing like the upbeat Destiny's Childs songs not that it matters.  I wasn't expecting her to sound exactly as though she was singing with Michelle and Kelly but at the same time I was expecting for her songs to be of the same calibur.  Don't get me wrong the CD isn't completely terrible.  I love Crazy in Love and have since I first heard it.  Then there are songs like Hip Hop Star that is kinda funky in a really good way and Me, Myself and I that I really enjoy listening to.  I can't understand what the whole point of putting the song Dangerously in Love on her solo project when it was already featured on the Survivor CD.  I'm not really feeling the 'Speechless' song nor the cheesy 'That's how you like it,\\" Featuring Jay-Z.  I really only like less than half of this CD when I was expecting more.  Maybe next time she will nail it!
B00005T33W|5.0|Ghost World is one of my favourite movies ever. I absolutely love it. It's hilarious, has a great cast, powerful characters, and teenager dilemas. The movie is entitled &quot;Ghost World&quot;, not only after a comic, but it means something. It pretty much means that everyone is progressively becoming the same person, and all that is left are the ghosts of the people that used to be. You can see how people get increasingly more similiar in the movie, and in real society as well. Plus, Thora Birch looks so much better with the extra 20 pounds she put on for the role.
B00005JLYU|4.0|If you saw the first Charlie's Angels movie then you know what to expect here. The truth is, Charlie's Angles: Full Throttle offers nothing that the first Charlie's Angels movie didn't. It follows our scantily-clad heroes through another outlandish big-budget adventure that takes them from Northern Mongolia to Hollywood and many places in between. But it is undeniably fun and a great action movie.<br />Don't try and make sense of the story; the suspension of disbelief required to follow this movie is astronomical, and the stunts and action sequences are beyond ridiculous, but if you're prepared to let go and immerse yourself in this audio-visual feast then you're guaranteed to have some fun.<br />Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore shine as the title characters, they offer good performances without ever taking themselves too seriously, much like the movie itself. Demi Moore plays Madison Lee, the movie's villain, who was once a Charlie's Angel herself before she decided to quit and work for herself. Her performance is disappointing; whenever she's on screen there's a sense of \\"look at me, I'm making a comeback\\", but her role is shallow anyway so it isn't all her fault. Justin Theroux gives a delicious performance as an Irish mobster, and it's nice to see that Robert Patrick, who has fun with his double-crossing role, is getting noticed by Hollywood.<br />There are lots of celebrity cameo roles to be found in this movie, most of which work well, such as Bruce Willis, and a couple which fall flat, such as pop star Pink. I was pleasantly surprised to see comic legend John Cleese playing Lucy Liu's father, although sadly he is given little room for any comedy and is present only as a novelty. Bernie Mac is hilarious as Bosley, the girls' link with the mysterious millionaire Charlie.<br />This sequel has a more complex plot structure than its predecessor, which serves it well. It also tries to add some emotional depth by taking Drew Barrymore's character on a difficult personal journey, but whenever it does this the movie falls flat and feels totally forced, such as when Drew trudges alone into a Mexican bar for no apparent reason other than to show one of the original Charlie's Angels TV show actresses (and I'll leave you guessing which one) in a silly cameo role, by far the movie's weakest moment.<br />Even though it's basically the same as the first film, it's very hard not to like this film. A brainless summer blockbuster to be sure, but well worth seeing. You'll definitely get your $7.50's worth of entertainment.ifficult personal journey, but whenever it does this the movie falls flat and feels totally forced, such as when Drew trudges alone into a Mexican bar for no apparent reason other than to show one of the original Charlie's Angels TV show actresses (and I'll leave you guessing which one) in a silly cameo role, by far the movie's weakest moment.<br />Even though it's basically the same as the first film, it's very hard not to like this film.

B000066NW0|5.0|Do NOT listen to all those anti-avrils out there. I don't even know why they just judge avril when they don't know her. Look, does anyone have proof she doesn't write her own songs???? Ok, she co-wrote them, but atleast she did something instead of just singing off someone elses lyrics like other pop singers! <BR>Another thing, what's the deal about her being 'fake'? She can dress how she wants. She's a singer, so its the music that counts, not HER. Who cares if she isn't a punk? She doesn't sing punk and even if you go raving and ranting about it, nothing will change. It's just her. <BR>As for her music, i like it! And all my friends do to. If I know anyone who hates Avril, it's because of her being a 'punk wannabe' or something. Her music is good. Many people can relate to the songs and there are many types of themes. Check it out, i'm sure you'll like it!
B000002G23|4.0|Great box set, excellent value for your money. Not every track is on here as stated by the liner notes! Where is the live version of &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; that was the b-side of the &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me '86&quot; single?
B000002BQK|5.0|This was THE album of '97, anywhere you went you whould hear, &quot;Honey&quot; or &quot;My All&quot; being played, whether in the mall, CD store and once in an elevator (I swear!) Even though Mariah has released three more CD's after this, they can't compare to this one right here (though &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; has come close). &quot;Butterfly&quot; was Mariah's &quot;freeing&quot; album, after a stressful divorce, Mariah practically &quot;spread her wings and prepared to fly&quot; and had total control over this album. She picked the songs, the music and the people she wanted to work with-hip/hop artists. <br />&quot;Butterfly&quot; is a unique album in the sense that Mariah, does something new and something familliar to her fans. Something new is the hip/hop sound that she crafted on the likes of &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;The Roof&quot; among others. Something familliar, soft, lush, brash ballads that have Mariah belting out a tune, like on &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; and &quot;My All&quot;. But let's start from the beginning...<br />&quot;Honey&quot; is a slick track produced by none other than P.Diddy (he was known as Puff Daddy back then) with a long forgotten Mase on rap verses. &quot;Butterfly&quot; is the mystical, lush ballad that is Mariah's &quot;theme song&quot; of the moment, I personally love the lyrics. &quot;My All&quot; with it's Spanish guitars and Mariah's pleading vocals is a winner along with &quot;The Roof&quot; which has a slow jam hip/hop feel to it, it's a pretty catchy song. &quot;Breakdown&quot; has got to be the BEST song on the whole album. It's incredible, worth one star alone. With Bone Thugs n Harmony doing backing and the lone piano chords it's an addicting song. &quot;Babydoll&quot; co-written by Missy Elliot is a soft R&amp;B track that soars. &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; is eerie and delicate while &quot;Outside&quot; has a churchy feel to it and some darn good lyrics. The remake of the purple one's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; is an awesome remake with Dru Hill backing up Mariah. &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; and &quot;Fourth Of July&quot; (a continuation of &quot;Daydream&quot;'s &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot;) have the signature sound of Mariah written all over it. <BR>You can't go wrong with this album, it's for all the moods, whenever you have mixed emotions, pop in &quot;Butterfly&quot; and have that mood changed in just a matter of seconds.
0345440900|2.0|Secrets of the Baby Whisperer is an okay read.  It presents the &quot;eat, wake, sleep&quot; routine that many people use (i.e., a baby eats, then has some awake time, and then sleeps -- instead of the baby relying on the eating to fall asleep).  And it explains how to watch for a baby's signs of sleepiness.  For these general discussions, this book is okay.  So read it if a friend gives it to you, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.<br />I find it ironic that a book which seems to promote positive interaction between parent and child in fact does the exact opposite.  Instead of promoting connecting, usually accomplished by snuggling and soothing a newborn, Hogg presents a very austere approach.  She explains that most &quot;bad habits&quot; are caused by parents rocking or swaying their children to sleep, allowing a baby to fall asleep on a parent's chest, and other things that most parents do with a newborn.  Her approach is for a baby, even at one day old, to learn to fall asleep unassisted, motionless, in his own crib.  Now, I certainly agree with the importance of a baby learning to fall asleep unassisted and developing healthy sleep habits (I highly recommend Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child), but most experts explain that a newborn under 6-8 weeks old doesn't have the ability to do so.  A newborn a few days or weeks old wants to be cuddled, to feel warm and safe against a parent's chest, to hear his mother's heartbeat, and to feel the rhythmic movements he became used to inside the womb.  I simply don't understand how it helps to &quot;calm, connect, and to communicate with your baby&quot; by not cuddling, rocking, or even holding your baby.  Especially for the first few weeks, after that it's important to promote some independence, but not before it's time.<br />So read the book if you have it, but do not expect it to be a manual on baby's behavior or sleep.  Instead, buy a book written by a doctor, a sleep expert.
B000002J03|4.0|Led Zeppelin is the BEST rock band of all time and this album examplifies it perfectly.  It opens with the catchy Whole Lotta Love with its Psychodelic midpart.  Next comes What Is and What Should Never Be with its ups and downs.  Number 4 the Lemon song is about, well listen to the song and you will soon find out, its a neat song.  It has its moments of mellow blues like rock and portions of very fast riffs all backed by Plant's sly vocals. Thank You is not bad, has an intresting break in the ordinary since someone else sings part of the chorus (Jimmy Page maybe) but otherwise its a little too slow and lovey dovey for me.  Heartbreak is after that, and this is a mean tune.  Its got such a sly riff to it, heavy bass, good vocals, and a great guitar solo (thanks to the guitar hero Jimmy Page).  Livin Lovin Maid is almost like an instant continuation, this is another incredible tune.  Its so catchy and fun sounding.  Ramble On, another one of my favorites.  It sounds like theres a problem with your CD at first, but it isnt.  Accustic Guitar slow riffs sliced by really powerful vocaled choruses really set it apart.  Moby Dick, Number 8, is totally instrumental.  I love the parts where the guitar is played, sick riff. But the extremely long drum solo, though it exemplifies Bonham's talent, really didnt do much for me.  Its just too long!  The last one is Bring It on Home.  Its another unique one.  In the opening of the song has Plant singing in his impression of like an American Western singer, which is goofy to say the least.  When the song gets going in the middle, it has SUCH a good beat to it, fast and like a little freaky sounding which is great in my opinion.  It closes with Plant singing in the same way as he did in the begining, though a little less goofy in the end.  All in all an excellent album
B00005M91K|2.0|This film is, to me, nothing more than an exquisitely endered screen saver. Its 'message' is simple, trite and after a while repetitive. It is a good advertisement for bourgois holiday makers looking for 'gritty... oooh magawd!' holiday experiences. A higher 'new age vacuity' quotient than should be allowed in a feature length film.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Ok, so in truth I would have only given the Two Towers theatrical version four stars. But only because of the positively cruel character assasination of poor Faramir! (If you haven't read the books and you thought he was a jerk- or you don't remember who he is- please reconsider until the next movie comes out, ok?) Even the Elves at Helm's Deep weren't so bad, or moving Saruman to the next film (which, in my opinion, was extremely brave, as they have a LOT to contend with in the next film), but poor Faramir. Always underappreciated. *sigh*<br />But, that leads me to the reason that I'm giving this DVD 5 stars. From what I've heard (from multiple, reliable sources) there is going to be in the new footage Faramir's finding of Boromir's body in the boat, plus a few scenes with Denethor and Boromir, which will hopefully let the viewers see Faramir's family problems, which -obviously- tempted him to bring the ring home for his father, in the movie.<br />Still, I'm a bit unhappy with them in that aspect. But Gollum was absolutely fantastic, and Orlando Bloom didn't have so much screen time, both of which made me extremely happy.<br />Well, all I can say is, I hope they get Faramir right in the next one. They've done pretty much everything else perfectly (if you're not a devout purist, that is).
B000092ZYX|4.0|Media hype is something you either believe or don't believe. That you have to decide on your own. Every time.<br />Radiohead is one of those bands you can't ignore these days. The release of \\"Hail to the thief\\" is a major happening in 2003, whether you like it or not. The album itself, too, you either like it or not. On \\"Hail to the thief\\", the songs are way too classy to hate the band, yet they leave you with a non-too-pleasant aftertaste which makes it hard to return to the album next time.<br />The repetition of words \\"Sit down. Stand up\\" sticks so much in your mind that you'll actually want to \\"walk into the jaws of hell\\", as Thom Yorke friendly suggests. Or \\"Sail to the moon\\", a rather short trip yet monotonous enough to make you feel the empty space. Here and there some politics, that is, if you bother to read the lyrics. \\"We suck young blood\\" is an experience as painful as the title suggests while \\"Backdrifts\\" sounds like a word game.<br />Fortunately, Yorke &co. didn't limit themselves to creating eerie, ambiguous soundscapes. After the nearly unlistenable \\"Amnesiac\\", they seem to have rediscovered what they're best at: writing rigorous yet straight enough rock songs. Listen to \\"Go to sleep\\" and you'll hear what I mean. \\"Where I end and you begin\\" may well be the most haunting song written this year, certainly is the most remarkable track on \\"Hail...\\". \\"I will\\" is rather short, simple yet very touching, a welcomed break from the noisy art sound which tries to dominate the album. \\"Myxomatosis\\" will blow you away, leaving you \\"tongue-tied\\". For these few songs you'll keep coming back to \\"Hail to the thief\\" and eventually, you'll come to understand the other, \\"difficult\\" tracks.<br />With everything being said, the choice is left to you whether you enter Radiohead's world or not. If you want to like them, they'll give you enough reasons to do so; if you choose to hate them, don't even bother with \\"Hail to the thief\\".<br />And if your mind is open enough to  \\"walk into the jaws of hell\\", the devil be with you!
B000099T2L|2.0|for all the Hype&whatnot that comes with Beyonce the bottom line is that She just doesn't cut it as a legit Solo Artist.She has the Diana Ross Persona but the Mary Wilson Material&that doesn't equal a Legit Solo Career.Catchy Stuff&She Sings alright but She isn't close to where She must go to Being what the Hype will lead you to believe.She needs to take a cue from Her Group Mate Kelly Rowland: drop a Real Catchy first song.
B00009V7RF|3.0|Politically conscious hip hop quartet (is it just me or is there a new member?) release their latest effort, Elephunk, borrowing the title from another animal loving neo-soul group, White Stripes, who released Elephant earlier this year. Anywho, The Black Eyed Peas have established themselves as a funky, influential & intresting aspect of the music industry, one that has kept both fans & critics attention and most commonly reacting with a positive spirit. Their new album does little to disappoint, and their multi-genre style continues to get people attracted.<br />The album's highly pop influenced lead single \\"Wheres the Love\\" featuring pop's reigning pretty boy prince Justin Timberlake, while very mainstream, is actually not all to bad. I believe that the group put the song as its closing though to try and stop fans from just listening to one song and then shutting off, hoping that fans will give it a straight through listen. It is safe to say though that if people are buying this record solely based on the lead single, they will be disappointed.<br />The highly offensive, yet catchy & bouncy \\"Lets Get Retarded\\" will appeal to club heads who like to 'be cool' by getting drunk & high, but true BEP fans will find themselves skipping this one. Other noteworthy songs include \\"Smells like Funk\\", the rock-market ready \\"Anxiety\\" & the James Brown sound-a-like \\"Shut Up\\", a relationship track.<br />This songs are catchy and diverse which will attract new fans, but old fans of the group are almost guaranteed to be disappointed with most of the material on here, being that it strays to far from their proven effective formula to do things that aren't exactly excepted among their audience. Hopefully they can recoop and bring it harder next time around.

0440214041|5.0|I love most of Grisham's books and have several of them and this is one of my favorites.  Another is THE CLIENT.  Two Supreme Court justices are killed and the government is baffled as to who could have done it and a law student decides to figure out who was responsible and does, but then is on the run for her life.  She can't trust anyone.  It seems that everyone that reads the brief she has written is getting killed.  There is a lot of manipulation in the government offices, from the White House, to the FBI, and to the CIA.  The FBI gets hold of the brief, but doesn't really take it seriously and yet there is mention of the President in it, and since there is a personality clash between some of the FBI officials and the administration, decides to make the president think they are taking it seriously. Then events really get rolling. The book is fast paced and exciting all the way through.
B00003CXXM|3.0|good points: us consulate scene and car chase, some interesting stunts.<br />bad points: pacing is uneven, some story elements are implausible - eg, bourne is up on his feet 2 wks after taking three bullets in the back, the whole cia story is muddled.<br />verdict: worth a rental.

This is a good book to read if you are someone who enjoys the computer and corporate world and plenty of thrills and espionage.  It keeps your interest all the way through it.

0066214122|1.0|nice idea, but I was not able to suspend my disbelief.  there were too many opportunities to call for help, and the reasons they did not, even though they (the characters) seemed to comprehend the nature of the problem, were just too stupid.  I could not get beyond that, unfortunately.  Crichton may need a new editor unafraid of pointing out boogers in his writing.
B00002Z88D|5.0|The greatest live album of all time was recorded in April 1999 by Lars Ulrich, Jason Newstead, Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield, aka Metallica, at the Berkley Community Theatre in California, and it is called S &amp; M. Any true music fan must have this collection in their collection. It surpasses the live greats like 'Stand by your van' by Sublime and Queen 'Live at Wembley '86'. In this album the afformentioned Metallica strike a collaboration with the San Fransisco symphony orchestra, under the conduction of Michael Kamen and blast out some of there most famous songs like 'Enter Sandman' from the black album and 'Master Of Puppets' for the eponomous album.<br />One must appreciate the juxtposition of the Orchestra the crowd and the greatest rock band ever. This is particularly apparent in three of the songs. On the first cd 'The Memory Remains' incorporates the three groups that night, particularly during the piece which Marien Faithfull sings on 'Reload'. The crowd sing her piece which is very powerful. 'One' is my second favourite track with the Orchestra providing the backdrop to this classic track.<br />Finally 'Nothing Else Matters', the introductory track to CD 2, is my favourite track. With Hetfield on the acoustic guitar and Hammett and Newstead on guitar,this soft track is a powerful ballad which is a favourite to many. The true Metallica shines through here as it is clear that they can sing in many different genres thus proving that they are indeed the greatest ever rock band. METALLICA FOREVER !
B00005J6SZ|5.0|When I cast my mind back to 1984, I was 12 years old and in my first year of high school. Music had become the major focus of my life (like most teenagers), and one of my biggest highlights from 1984, aside from starting high school, was receiving the Like A Virgin album on vinyl as a Christmas present.<br />Prior to the release of Like A Virgin, her music career had been somewhat sketchy with the sleeper hit that was her first album. When the video for Like A Virgin debuted on the TV music shows with Madonna cavorting on a gondolier through the canals of Venice, it cemented her position as a major hit in the pop market. It also made us teens all the more eager for Madonna.<br />Like A Virgin, produced by Nile Rodgers, is certainly her most dated album musically. You can tell it was produced in the mid 80's with the characteristic drum machine and synthetic hand claps ubiquitously present throughout. This is not a bad thing though - the music is very tight and fresh sounding, and it was a huge commercial success.<br />The first track 'Material Girl', was the second single and another huge hit - due in part I'm sure to the very clever video with Madonna mimicking Marilyn Monroe from 'Diamonds are a girls best friend'. 'Angel' and 'Over and over' and 'Dress you up' could be described as electronica of the day, but it is the ballads where Madonna shines. 'Love don't live here anymore', one of the very few covers Madonna has done, shines not only musically but as a showcase for Madonna's burgeoning vocal talents. 'Shoobedoo', another ballad, is just as beautiful with Madonna singing about a subject close to her heart - a love gone sour. <br />'Pretender' and 'Stay', two excellent 80's sounding pop songs, finish off the original album.<BR>The two original remixes for 'Like a virgin' and 'Material girl' are added as a bonus on this release. Great for nostalgia as extended remixes in those days were a lot different to the remixes of today.<br />For fans who purchased the vinyl the first time around this is a great CD to get to complete your Madonna CD collection, especially as the music has been remastered and has never sounded better. For recent fans who may not have heard this album, it is an excellent purchase where you get to experience a part of history when Madonna's star really started to shine.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is the best alternative album, in my opinion, that this year will produce, and I don't mean the faux &quot;alternative&quot; which stands for bands who sound exactly alike. This is true alternative music that is different from anything that has been made in recent years. The Mars Volta don't sound like anyone else. With that said, this album is a definitive musical statement. There is so much going on in this album that it's hard to believe. This is one of those records that just makes you feel so small when you listen to it, and that's a blessing. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. It just might change your perspective on a lot of things.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to be off to work - but I HAVE TO say that this band is the most amazing sound i have ever heard, and i listen to a lot of different kinds of rock.  Every single track on this album i could listen to for eternity - trust my word on this... this band is AWESOME, evanescence... i love you.
0375823360|1.0|Philip Pullman pretends to write fantasy, but rather uses fantasy as a platform to denounce God and present a reversed spiritual world.  Witches and the rebel angels fight on the side of good, and God and the psalm singing angels are considered evil.  One example, towards the end of the third book, is when the girl Mary describes an angel she met... \\"Her name was Xaphania.  She told me many things... She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupididty.  She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom have always tried to open minds; the Authority (God Almighty) and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.  She gave me many examples from my world.\\"  The Authority dies in the third book and is replaced by Enoch from the Bible.  Pullman finishes the book by encouraging people to build the Republic of Heaven since there will never be a Kingdom of Heaven. The most frustrating thing about these three books is that the reader doesn't know for sure who is bad and who is good until the third book.  As a teacher, I was reluctant to recommend the first book in the series to my students because I wasn't sure what the author was really trying to say.  By the second book, I was pretty concerned about the content but decided to wait until the third book to make a judgement.  The third book confirmed my concerns, and was disheartening to read.  I finished it, just to make absolutely sure that there wasn't a redeeming ending.  On the contrary, the book ends with the two emerging pubescent children falling in love and being intertwined in each others arms then parting for life.  Yuck!
B00008NG5V|5.0|If you like Brushfire Fairytales, or if you just like the sound of an acoustic guitar, you will absolutely love Jack Johnson's mellow, soothing lyrics and creative guitar strums. This is one wonderful album to own.
B00005QG9J|5.0|A lot of Incubus fans that I've talked to say that this CD is way softer and Incubus should go back to their roots with their \\"Harder Style\\" (And I'm making the quote marks signal in the air while I type. . .well, no one can type and do that at the same time, so just imagine me doing it).  While this CD has mellow tracks, it still has it's \\"hard\\" moments as well.  For instance. . . \\"Just A Phase\\", which is a brilliantly written song, while starting out slow, has a huge burst of not only sound, but emotion as well.  I'm sure most buyers my age will buy it merely for the singles, (\\"Warning\\", \\"Nice To Know You\\" and such) but the entire CD is incredible.  My favorite track has got to be \\"Under My Umbrella\\".  I'm not going to describe it, but it's powerful, and it relates to my numerous hardships with women and what-not.  Other tracks like \\"Circles\\", (Another rad track (I'm really trying not to say the 'F' word in my descriptions)) \\"Have You Ever\\", and \\"Blood on the Ground\\", (Another ... rad track) are all wonderful tracks as well as the singles.  I highly suggest this CD if you want something to listen to the whole way through.  I'm not saying it'll change you life or anything. . .but it made me look at things different, and it's kinda rare that you hear music that can change the way you. . .I dunno. . .see things, feel things, think about things. . .well. . .you get the jist.  Oh yeah, and this CD's GREAT ...as well.<br />Ciao & Happy listening!<br />Keepin' it as real as possible,<BR>J.D.
B000089RVX|1.0|nah.. i have heard better. The first three songs are hard to desipher from then it goes to a crummy slow one then back to the undesipherable guitar riffs and vocals. If you feel the need to hear a woman sing for a &quot;change&quot; get some one worth listening. eg: the yea yea yeas, or the distillers. this is not a great example.
B000068IEU|5.0|This is the type of film that can only be viewed once in a great while for me cause of the true and disturbing nature of the plot.  The story involves two blossoming beauties, one from the country and one from the city, who go into the city to check out a concert.  What awaits them is relentless terror brought on by a group of sickos who have no regard for human life whatsoever.  Actually based on Ingmar Bergman's Jungfrukllan (The Virgin Spring).  So many other films have tried to use the same concept, but NONE come close to this.  The DVD is a must own for the awesome extras, though the image and sound are dated.
B00003CX96|5.0|Despite the &quot;shown-on-TBS-in-the-afternoon&quot; feeling to this movie I actually love it, and like it more every time I watch it.  First of all I love bikes, and I love Europe, so I immediately had something in common with the protagonist.  But really all the characters are identifiable in some way.  Now it seems that even college kids are finding that their lives seem aimless, and the movie seems to speak to that theme that is daunting for almost all of us.  You'd think it would be cheesy, and in some respects it is, but nonetheless it's hard not to cheer for them to win the bicycle race.  I do even though I know the outcome.  <BR>The boy's father is perhaps the most interesting character.  His transformation from gruff to understanding is totally believable, and what you want to happen.  The movie doesn't make it look like everything is going to be alright, in fact one character is still noticably directionless at the end, but things do end on happy, though not too sappy note.  My two favorite scenes are when Dennis saronades &quot;Carolina&quot; with the Italian aria, and the very last scene (you'll see).
B000000OE7|5.0|If this album says anything, it's a wonderful ending to Queen's music but an unfortunate end due to Freddie Mercury's death. This album was indeed recorded while Freddie Mercury was dying of AIDS in 1991 and was very well done. It was the confessions of this dying man who had the vocal ability that many current musicians wish for.<br />You can feel it when it's upbeat and you can feel it in your heart when it's meant as a sad but true confession of Freddie Mercury that he was dying.<br />There is nothing wrong with this record, it's just as great as any other Queen album and offers the same as the rest of the Queen albums. The only difference is this was the end and it was a very wonderful end to the great career of this band who left behind a legacy.

0783225970|5.0|One of the greatest epics ever filmed and Tony Montana is one of the greatest characters in movie history. The reason I love Al Pacino is that he literally becomes his characters and Tony is no different. The plot is extremely clever I thought. I always like when fiction is mixed with a little bit of non-fiction. Castro opening up the \\"flood gates\\" for his undesirables to come to the US actually took place. Montana and longtime friend Monolo Ray come over from Cuba as political prisoners who have criminal records. They end up escaping from a Refugee camp when they off a guy for green cards. After that they do a job for a guy named Frank Lopez who is the \\"Yayo\\" kingpin of Miami. The drug deal gone bad or the  \\"chainsaw\\" scene is one of the most brutal scenes ever. Anyway, Tony goes on to get close to Lopez and becomes his right hand man. The relationship goes sour because Lopez tries to assassinate Tony for making a side deal with Alejandro Sosa, a big time Bolivian drug dealer. The scene where Tony takes the reigns from Lopez is amazing. Him sitting there with his one arm in a sling clutching a gun with his other arm is great filmmaking. Tony ends up becoming the top drug lord of Miami's streets when he teams with Sosa. The relationship goes bad when Tony botches up a job Sosa gave him to do. This all leads to the climax which is one of the greatest and bloodiest scenes in movie history. It also ranks up there with some of the great endings in movie history like Se7en for example. Of course Pacino is astounding in this role, Steven Bauer plays his boy Manolo, Michelle Pfeiffer plays Elvira, Tony's junkie wife, Robert Loggia plays Frank Lopez, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio plays Tony's sister Gina (who is one of Tony's many obsessions). The movie is a little long, but I didn't even notice it. If you love gangster flicks, Scarface, The Godfather Saga, and New Jack City are the ones to have.This is a dope movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|As one of the few CDs I felt compelled to actually go out and buy this year, I have to say that Evanescence's Fallen shows a promise I haven't seen the likes of since Linkin Park. But, to set the record straight, that's where the similarities between the two bands end. <br />Evanescence boasts a much different sound overall despite echoing instrumentals due to the powerhouse voice of lead vocalist, Amy Lee. And by powerhouse, I don't mean Celine Dion -- I mean Tori Amos. This is a voice that will catch you as you listen and will stay with you long after the album is over. Fallen features mostly dark and brooding rock-pop (yes, this is pop-influenced) songs, although, rest assured, it's much harder than any of Michelle Branch's brand of syrupy rock-pop. <br />Songs that stood out (And I'm saying these from memory, so they really are the stand-outs):<br />Going Under: An ear-catching opening.. A cliched &quot;gritty voice&quot; -- you know, the one that sounds like someone's speaking to you from the bottom of an abandoned well -- kicks off the song, but it rapidly gets awesome. Creative chorus and impacting lyrics. 5/5 <br />Everybody's Fool: This song completely mirrored what I was feeling when I first listened to the CD. Amy sings about someone who completely mistreated her and didn't even realize what they were doing. Nice twist ending 5/5<br />Tourniquet: Ah. the controversial pseudo-Christian song. Although I still think this track had religious influences, it wouldn't matter anyway. Enjoy it for its raw emotion and brilliant wordplay 5/5<br />Hello: One of the two ballads on this disk, and this is the better one by far. My Immortal is a mediocre song.. not cuz it wasn't well-written -- it was -- but it just never stays in my mind. Hello, however, is an imaginative and wrenching confession. Beautiful piano accompaniment to Amy's bare voice. 5/5 <br />--These were just a few of my favorite songs off the album. However, my total score for the album overall would probably be more like 4&amp;1/2 .. But I rounded up. They deserve the extra credit because we'll definitely be seeing more great albums from Evanescence in the future.
B00004Z400|5.0|i bought the album based on reviews and i had heard &quot;back to school&quot; and some of their other songs before and liked them. yet when listening to the whole album while driving down a skinny road at night, i was creeped out by the music, &quot;change&quot; and &quot;passenger&quot; especially. the tool influence was obvious in the song even before the singer opened his mouth in &quot;passenger.&quot; in &quot;change,&quot; the lyrics are great and i just love how there can be heavy metal music, but a slow tempo and such a creepy song, let it mean whatever you want to you. &quot;mini maggit,&quot; a reprise of the album opener, starts soft and works back into the refrain from &quot;back to school&quot; which is a great way to close off the album. a must have for any fans of tool, as it is the same type of music, but yet distinctive. there is only one song i skipped over, as it is way too hard for me, that's &quot;elite.&quot; someone who likes disturbed or saliva might like that though.
B000000993|4.0|This is a really good Tool album the first one I bought really. I personaly like this better then Aneima. I dont however think this is Tools best album that prize goes to Laterulus. This album has some really good songs such as the hits \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" but the deep cuts are great as well like \\"Intolerance\\" \\"Bottom\\" \\"Crawl Away\\" \\"Swamp Song\\" and \\"Undertow\\". You see the first seven songs are the best the last three are just alright, but their still not bad. Adam Jones plays some of his best guitar on this album, and Maynerd James Kennon sounds awsome like usuall! The Drummer is great as well. Dont be fooled, this is way better then Aneima so pick it up!
B00004U8P9|5.0|This movie is my favriote. it has been my favriote since i was 7 and it is still my favriote. Tim Curry is also my favriote actor this movie movies is a all time classic i could on and on forever about the great song that you are going to be singing to yourself for weeks to come, and the great costumes and just all around freaky atmosphere the movie sets off about THE MASTER and his SEXUAL APPITITE. witch is kind of weird but hey if it floats your boat.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album has it all Shred, Solos, Powerful vocals, and Cliff! It is in my opinion Metallicas best work!<br />-Fight Fire With Fire, This is shred at its best 4/5<br />-Ride The Lightning, Killer Title track! 5/5<br />-For Whom The Bell Tolls, One Of Metallicas Best songs. 5/5<br />-Fade To Black, One of Metallicas best songs easily in their top 5  and has one of Hammets best guitar solos!5/5<br />-Trapped Under Ice, Metallicas most underrated song in my opinion cause this song is awsome! 4/5<br />-Escape, A great metal song that does not let up or slow down for anyone 4/5<br />-Creeping Death, This is one of my favorite Metallica songs its why I bought this album, a really great song! 5/5&lt;<br />-The Call Of Ktulu, this is a killer instrumental that Dave Mustain of Megadeath wrote when he was in the band 4/5<br />So as you can tell this is a classic Metallica album that you should not miss out on, this is one of their best albums hands down!
B00005JLK1|5.0|Well to start off I really liked this movie the first time i saw it.I thought it was the best movie I had seen in a long time that of course is why I gave it 5 stars. But watching it for a second time I am starting to notice a few spoofs some I can place and some i just cant remember the names of but I know I have seen befor. For starters there is a spoof from the lost boys, there is one from pet symetery. There is also one from 13 ghosts but on a little more extreme level witch becomes apparent in the first 10 min of the movie. There is on from house on haunted hill the new one not the old one. And belive it or not there is even one from titanic but a little more crepper. I am a movie buff but I cant place all the cliches but i know there is more. Other than all the cliches it was actually a very good movie. I would buy it if I haddent already.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of the greatest albums ever, easily in the top 10. I mean The album changed music forever, and made Nirvana one of the best bands ever. 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Changed music as weel, I mean who doesnt love that song. 'Come As You Are' is my favorite Nirvana Song, but thats besides the point, the point is you have to own this album, it was a milestone in music history, you willl love this album I garante it. Not a bad track here, This has a perfect blend of metal, and amazing ballads. As Simple as 'Polly' is it is also brillent. The whole album is brillent really belive me, please when you buy this your only regret is not owning it sooner, so get this you'll love it.
0385335482|5.0|I was looking at the best selling paperbacks section ... when the word \\"Shopaholic\\" caught my eye. \\"Has someone written a book about me?\\" I thought to myself as I picked up the book and flipped through the pages. I read the back and instantly fell in love with it, and I haven't even read a single page. Confessions of a Shopaholic was my life saver. I took it home and read it in one night (something else I enjoyed, it was a quick read). Becky Bloomwood is the fictional version of myself. I was laughing at her adventures through financial hell because honestly, I have been there too!! It's a wonderful book that any woman with the shopping bug will totally enjoy. Right after finishing it I passed it on to my fellow Shopaholic mother who agreed in saying that it was quite a delight to read.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|So you're a Jane Austen fan? This movie is probably irresistable for at least one viewing purely for curiosity's sake. Be warned though, that this movie is so full of celebs that are so busy playing dress-up that it absolutely ruins a classic romance and cleverly witty masterpiece. If it's Hollywood's interpretation of England you want, this movie is for you. Otherwise, stick with the Kate Beckinsale version of Emma.
0345457684|2.0|Not only will you get seizures from looking at the cover you will get them from waiting diligently for this story to pick up.  I am not going to explain the book because chances are you have already read a summary. If you want to read the book where it should have started (And I don't recommend it) open to page 250.  You won't have missed a thing. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I enjoyed the run of the mill sarcasm. So if you like a strung out story and mediocre sarcasm read on.
0767020308|5.0|This is a fantastic Jane Austen adaptation, showing the author's romanticism as well as her great sense of humor. To tell you the story of Emma would ruin the viewing for you. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, this will become another must-have, often-viewed disc for your collection. Beware of the modern version of Emma with Gwenyth Paltrow. While a curiosity piece for Austen collectors, it is so busy being packed full of celebs that it looses the mood of the story.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Some nice new material from Buckingham and Nicks.  Have to say that I like 99% of the songs on the CD.  18 songs is good especially since several of these demos have been floating around the net for a while and a couple appeared on the previous DANCE CD.  Two of my favorite tracks are WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO and SILVER GIRL.  Someone else previously mentioned that we just didn't get enough of the Buckingham/Nicks harmonies together on all of the songs.  Yeah, overall the CD does sound like Buckingham and Nicks solo efforts put together but this is some of their best work.  You can hear Mick Fleetwood's unique drum style on several tracks as well as John McVie's pumping bass on tracks like SILVER GIRL.  Some good music from the multi-talented Lindsey Buckingham.  Stevie Nicks has so many loyal fans so she will likely continue to write songs and release albums for years to come.  Also, it's nice to see that so many people miss Christine &quot;Perfect&quot; McVie who was the lead vocalist on most of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits.
B00006RU5B|5.0|To begin id just like to say what a wonderful, beautiful, refreshing breath of fresh air this cd has been to me (matter of fact im listening to it now!!),the partnership of Chris and the remaining Rage members is brilliant and very complementary to both sides, it is quite a relief to know that there are still musicians/musical artists who can put their heart and soul into their creations, i must admit i have always been a major Chris Cornell fan, some of the most intense spiritual expieriences ive ever had have happened while listening to \\"just like suicide\\"  off of Soungardens Superunknown, im sharing this hoping someone else out there can make the same connection that i have using this song as a medium, anyway back to Audioslave, i wont bore anyone with another breakdown of the songs and all, i Think Jake Mohlman's review is extremely accurate, Gasoline is my favorite song off this cd it is just awesome. All in All i dont think you can go wrong buying this one.

B000094A6A|4.0|First of all, a banana is not a vegetable.  A vegetable is a usually herbaceous plant (such as the cabbage, bean, or potato), which is grown for an edible part that can be eaten as part of a meal.  In contrast, a banana is an elongated usually tapering tropical fruit with soft pulpy flesh enclosed in a soft and usually yellow rind.<br />Second of all, the myth of Romulus and Remus is a Roman legend and not a Greek story.  Seduced by the god Mars (not Ares), the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia bore twin sons, Romulus and Remus.  Left to die in a basket on the river Tiber by her wicked uncle Amulius, the babes washed up on shore and were nursed by a she-wolf and fed bits of food by a bird until they were found and raised by a shepherd.  Growing to manhood they discovered their true identities and eventually founded the city of Rome, over the dead body of Remus.<br />When a film like &quot;Old School,&quot; which takes place across the street from a college campus, gets the facts wrong it certainly takes away from your enjoyment of the comedy.  Maybe when Will Ferrell's Frank is streaking down the street he is doing that wrong as well.  Maybe Vince Vaughn's Beanie does not give you the keys to Speaker City if he cannot beat a competitor's deal.  Maybe Luke Wilson's Mitch does remember what happened when he woke up in bed with an under aged coed.<br />&quot;Old School&quot; is about the aforementioned trio of friends who are disenchanted with becoming adults in the real world and who end up turning the house Mitch is renting into a college fraternity so that he can stay there.  That particular situation is contrived, to say the least, but then it ends up being pretty clear that the point of this film is to put three thirtysomething guys in situations that borrow from &quot;Animal House&quot; and pretty much every other party animal college film you have seen.<br />Ironically, given that this is the &quot;unrated edition,&quot; which means they throw everything back into the movie except a handful of deleted scenes, the storyline of &quot;Old School&quot; ends up seeming like scenes have been cut.  The relationship between Mitch and Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) hits a couple of stereotypical snags and they end up getting resolved off screen.  However, the biggest offense of this film is that when it comes time for the frat boys to take on the evil, wicked, bad, mean, and nasty Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), the film fails to come up with anything that is either particulary memorable or especially funny.  Instead of having a climax, this film just sort of peters out at the end.<br />Yes, there are some big laughs, such as when we learn a new use for asphalt bricks, but the film is mostly Vaughn and Ferrell stealing scenes from Wilson, who really does not have a whole lot to do here.  The extras include the previously mentioned deleted scenes, some outtakes and bloopers, and a less than steller parody of &quot;Inside the Actor's Studio&quot; (Ferrell does double-duty but the other two stars and writer-director Todd Phillips (&quot;Frat House,&quot; &quot;Road Trip&quot;) look lost during the proceedings.

0440236738|5.0|Beware: if you start this book, you may not be sleeping because you'll be up reading it instead!  This book was an easy read for me, I couldn't put it down.  Harlan Coben is great at twisting up the story and confusing you.  You never know what is coming next.  There are some things that you don't discover until the last page.

0446608955|5.0|I recently read this book for the third time.  Each time is just as great as the one before.  I want to start off by saying that it is very different from the movie.  So, for those of you that think you already know everything that will happen, you should think again.  <BR>I picked this book up at the library after reading &quot;The Notebook.&quot;  I had enjoyed that, but never expected to be as touched as I was when I read &quot;A Walk to Remember.&quot;  You can read the summaries, so I don't want to waste your time with what it's about.  But I would like to say that this book is one that you can cherish and re-read over and over again.  I have never been so emotionally involved in a story before.  Nicholas Sparks has a unique touch for romantic stories that pull on your heart.  <BR>This book reminds you of the innocence of first love, and the ability of it to change you forever.  <BR>Landon is my favorite fictional male character ever.  If you're a female, you'll wish that you were his.  As a male, you'll be able to get a few good hints on how to treat a lady!  Jamie is another great character.  She has such a beautiful soul, and you wish that she could stay protected forever.  Their relationship is one that happens only once in a lifetime. <BR>I recommend this book for anyone.  It will make you smile and cry.  It stays with you for a long time.

Everything, the way he phrases his licks, the harmonies, the progressions, everything is just gorgeous. This is one of those cds i could actually stand to listen to on loop for hours and hours. Buy it. You won't regret it, i promise you.
B000089RVX|1.0|I'm sick of people claiming how \\"orginal\\" and \\"meaningful\\" this band is. People please, just because it's the first time you've heard such music by no means makes it \\"original\\". Bands like Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Theatre of Tragedy, and Sins of Thy Beloved have been doing this music for years, and again with much more talent. Sure, the lead singer has a good voice, but compared to what? Pink? Avril Lavigne? Madonna?...I'm not saying that this band [is terrible] I'm stating my opinion that I don't like them and I'm sick of people praising then for making something that they ripped off of many respectable artists. If you like this album, fine, but I suggest you do yourself a favor and check out the roots of this music, you might actually enjoy it. And if you didn't so be it. It can't hurt to try.
B00004XONN|5.0|Although this cd is outshined in popularity by &quot;OK computer,&quot; and is known as just another chapter in the experimental days of radiohead, but that doesn't take away the fact that this IS radiohead's best album. Song after song of brilliantly written, perfectly unified music, &quot;kid a&quot; raises the bar on rock music. Every song on the album is some how correllated with the next, and still each song has its own feel. This is radiohead's &quot;Darkside of the Moon.&quot; Some radiohead fans steer clear of this album because it's &quot;wierd&quot; or whatever. Radiohead was trying something new, that deserves the fan's respect, and it deserves a listen from there mainstream rock fans. But simply because they were trying something new is not what makes this cd great, it is the songwriting, the creativity, and the originality that makes &quot;kid A&quot; radiohead's best.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Holy moly crap!!!<BR>First of all, Thank you all who were involved with releasing this. My only gripe is that its 20 some odd years to long. If you are a Zeppelin fan, you already have this DVD. If you are a guitarist,drummer,singer,bassist,keyboardist,musician or semi fan of Led Zeppelin and don't have this DVD, do yourself a favor and purchase it, NOW! I can't describe how good this DVD is. The Song Remains The Same is great, however this is a dream come true. If my house were on fire, I would grab my wife and kids and this DVD. Yes, it's that good. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. I'll probably never meet my earthly idols but this is the damn next best thing. This reminds me what the meaning of great songs and rock and roll is all about.

Le livre est beaucoup mieux que la peste. <BR>C'est crit simplement car Camus fait comme si c'tait Meursault qui nous racontait l'histoire et celui-ci est plutt  simple. <BR>Je conseille de le lire en franais c'est mieux.
B000002NHN|5.0|I came across Loreena McKennitt's music in an unusual way - listening to Art Bell's late-night radio show several years ago, during a period of unemployment.  Art had very unique (and similar) taste in music, and the &quot;bumper music&quot; (before and after commercial breaks) was always listed on his Web site.  I became so intrigued after hearing snippets of these CDs, that I bought both &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; and &quot;The Mask and the Mirror&quot;.<br />Not in many years have I repeatedly listened to new music over and over as I did when I received these two CDs in the mail.  I literally never got tired of them.<br />Neither of these CDs contain a less-than-beautiful track.  I highly recommend them both - you will not be sorry.
B00005JLYU|3.0|Overall,<BR>CA Full Throttle is great if you like loud music and skimpy outfits. It's a loosely stung together dancefest most of the time.<BR>Thin on plot, and gets even to ridiculous at times, can wait for this on video, save your money...
B00005JLYU|2.0|How do I start this, what kind of a movie is this?!?! For that scence where the angels are in a military vehicle and falling from the the air someone should have used a stinger and fired it up at them, that RPG was just not enough. After that stinger, is where the movie should end with them dead and the end credits start rolling. The oufits they wore is just bad. This movie just can not beat the TV series, Cheryl Ladd, Jaclyn Smith, Shelley Hack Farrah Fawcett, and Kate Jackson are true Angles. All the outfiits they wore were sexy dress down Friday work clothes and they all knew how work it wearing them. Even the stilettos and the outfits worked nice together. This new Angels movie should not have been put out into the theatere, it should have went quietly on to the home wideo rental market. The story line is just plane bad, it can not beat the good story lines the TV series had for each episodes. In this movie you could not tell the Angeles are PIs and has the right skills for it. The TV series told you sold and it did it in a way that worked. The only good sence in this that part of Demi Moore walking to her car in that bikini. This a sad movie that movie goes should not waste their money on. They should just save their money for Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machine when it comes out in theater on 4th of July week and when it comes on DVD to own.
B000003TAB|5.0|This album is fantastic,it's a break for all of those Nevermind super popular songs,the stuff on this album is very rare and really cool,songs are weird and dark,which is good,this album has been underrated but it's really good,take a time to listen carefully to it and realize how beautiful is all that guitar noise and screaming,it's awesome,i highly recommend it.
B000099T2L|5.0|i personally didn't think she would make it on her own... but beyonce is doing her thing, and i respect her for that. I think the album is really good...i really didn't know that she could sing that good...but this album proves shes more than just a pretty face! All the tracks are good...but the one that caught my attention was &quot;Dangerously in love 2&quot; its beautiful.... but i would advise anyone to get this album!
B0000035E7|5.0|This album is really really good and different from what Nirvana was after this,the songs are in a garage-style that sounds awesome,every song is cool, i cannot think of a weak song here,the opening BLEW will just blow you away,and the following tracks are just as good and better,PAPER CUTS is a creepy song with frightening vocals and dark lyrics,it rocks! NEGATIVE CREEP is fast and amazing,and the closing track DOWNER is one of the best in the album (that's why it was on INCESTICIDE too)the verses are kinda weird for beng Nirvana but they're really great and the pre-chorus and chorus are just the best way to finish an album,that song is on my top ten Nirvana songs,anyway,this album is very good,i highly recommend it,GET IT NOW!
B00005JKO3|5.0|I HAVE A COPY OF 'EL CID' ON DVD. IT IS A JAPANESE COPY WITH <BR>JAPANESE SUB-TITLES, WHICH YOU CAN ERASE.

B000069HK2|5.0|Ok. To start off: Every song on this CD is rockin', but not for everyone. It's a shame they're not number one on the album chart, because there is NO other band that I like EVERY song of theirs. <br />Maybe Memories: 95% This is an awesome song, very hard rock that most people will love.<br />The Taste OF Ink: 84% Great soft song at first, but gets old soon and once it does you'll likely never listen to it.<br />Bulimic: 96% Possibly the best song on the CD because of understandable screaming and awesome, touching lyrics.<br />Say Days Ago: 94% Hard! I really like this song, lots of screaming, yet you know exactly what Bert is saying.<br />Poetic Tragedy: 90% Hard song, full of screaming, and has a limited appeal. I really like it though because of great vocals.<br />Buried Myself Alive: 87% Hard and soft at the same time. Heavy guitar and soft vocals make a surprisingly good combination. Constant radio play knocked it down about 5 percent though, sadly.<br />A Box Full Of Sharp Objects: 85% Pretty much all screaming with some great lyrics, sadly you can't hear most of them, so I found myself at lyrics.com reading and saying: \\"Wow, this would be an even better song if you could hear it.\\" Great though, good tune.<br />Blue and Yellow: 96% I'm a sucker for soft songs like this, but you might like the harder stuff on the album, so it isn't for everyone. I love it, and its one of the best tracks on this CD in my opinion. \\"Rather waste some time with you..\\"<br />Greener With The Scenery: 93% Great slow song with lyrics you can seriously relate to, unless you're a 12 year old cheerleader that is into N*Sync.        <br />Noise And Kisses: 97% I really love this hard/soft song it has such... real lyrics. And it's just so awesome in the tune, the lyrics, everything.        <br />On My Own: 89% Good song. Not a cheerful song, but a pretty good one. Depressing and slow, but thats not necessarily a bad thing, and in this case, it's a good thing.       <br />Pieces Mended: 90%I'm not too crazy about this song but I must say it has some of the best lyrics in ANY song but the tune doesn't bring it together like it could.<br />Choke Me: 92% Hidden Track that you hear about maybe 9 minutes into Pieces Mended. Awesomely hard song that you can't understand half the time, but something you can really can bang heads to.    <br />In conclusion, the worst song on this CD gets 84% and that is awesome, because it's still an adaquetely good song (The Taste Of Ink.) And since that's the worst, the good is REALLY good. And it's all good on this CD. I would honestly pay 50 bucks for it, and since Amazon is offering it at a MUCH lower price GET IT!
B000002H33|5.0|Hey everyone...i believe this is the best album ever released by metallica...actually the best album ever released.  guitar is at its best possible in this cd.  although the black album is also an excellent cd, master of puppets is pure genious...congratulations, metallica!

This book gave me a new perspective in life and family!  I would recommend this book to anyone!

B00005JLYU|5.0|Don't go in expecting much because you wont et a lot out of it. <BR>The 1st movie was goofy colorful and full of fluff! This is not as goofy not as colorful and no fluff, but is that a bad thing no! It brings new flavors to the film like edgeiness, toughness. There are some funny jokes and the action is awesome! Cameron Diaz is really funny! Drew Barrymore brings depth to the picture and Lucy Liu is crazy! Watch for a funny cameo by John Cleese as Alex's Father.<BR>Overall this is a summer popcorn filck! Like \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" leave you brain at home and you'll enjoy it, thats what I did and really enjoyed this. Its a fun movie with a new spin on Charlie's Angels!<BR>See It!<br />Other good summer sequels:<BR>\\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\"<BR>\\"X2\\"<BR>\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\"<br />Other good summer movies:<BR>\\"Finding Nemo\\"<BR>\\"The In-Laws\\"<BR>\\"The Italian Job\\"<BR>\\"The Lizzie McGuire Movie\\"<BR>\\"Alex & Emma\\"
B00005O5CM|3.0|In spite of the fact that the plot makes no sense at all, and the characters are essentially cartoon figures, there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments (especially involving the UPS delivery man, who steals the show!)  Silly fluff, but a nice rental for a quiet evening at home with your sweetie.....
B00005QENZ|4.0|GET A GRIP is the once-disbanded Aerosmith's last all-original material album for Geffen Records. The cover photo became controversial. Many people thought the earring through the female cow's breast was disgusting. The track one INTRO contains a sample of WALK THIS WAY. EAT THE RICH is a food song similar to what \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic would write and record. This album is somewhat logical because of songs like FLESH and FEVER,two one-word five-letter titles. The same thing with CRYIN'(the apostrophe does not count although it represents a G) and CRAZY. I guess AMAZING became a hit due to Don Henley's background vocals. Ex-Eagle Henley was the band's Geffen Records labelmate. Yankovic later wrote parody lyrics for LIVIN' ON THE EDGE. His song was called \\"Livin' In the Fridge\\". SHUT UP AND DANCE is pretty cool. While on tour promoting this album,the band appeared in the movie \\"Wayne's World 2\\". They even did a concert scene where the film's stars Mike Myers and Dana Carvey were in attendance. A live version of SHUT UP AND DANCE appears on the soundtrack album and is played during the film's end credits. Awesome album!
B000002UAO|5.0|I think some people need to be \\"reminded\\" just how TRULY GREAT The Beatles were and still are? So before I say anything about how MAGNIFICENT Rubber Soul is, I'd like to say a few other things first. In the history of recorded music, there are The Beatles, and then there's everybody else! In fact, in the history of music there is only ONE other person who belongs \\"on the same stage,\\" and that person would be Beethoven. What do The Beatles and Beethoven have in common, that elevates them SO FAR above anybody else? They were both so good, that by merely playing their OWN music, they wrested artistic control from the hands of somebody else, and put it into the hands of the individual artist! In a productive millenia, \\"a force\\" like either The Beatles or Beethoven comes along only four or five times; and I'm talking about \\"forces\\" such as Alexander the Great! If you gave me The Beatles and Beethoven at their creative peaks, and someone took everybody else, well, MY TEAM would WIN every time; because no matter what the \\"other guys\\" came up with, if The Beatles couldn't \\"handle it,\\" then Mr. Beethoven SURE could! After The Beatles got going, then virtually EVERYBODY else was covering Beatles songs, however, they were doing NOTHING but their OWN material. <br />In 1968, The Beatles were singing about how \\"nice\\" it was to be \\"back\\" in the Soviet Union, and NOBODY said a thing; instead people just clapped and sang along! We were at the height of The Cold War, America was involved in a very unpopular confict in Vietnam, not to mention all of the civil unrest going on, but in spite of all that, a musical group released a song called \\"Back in the USSR,\\" yet NOBODY questioned if it was worthy for mass consumption? Yeah, ONLY BECAUSE The Beatles did it, and by then they'd shown THE WORLD SO MUCH, that they didn't have to prove a thing to anyone, anywhere! Oh, that was nothing, because they'd already conquered America, and they're the only one's to EVER do that; so are people \\"getting the picture\\" as to just how GREAT of a \\"force\\" The Beatles were? Also, they \\"managed\\" to PERFORM all these feats under the most INTENSE PRESSURE, that ANYBODY has ever seen, yet they didn't miss a beat! No, \\"these guys\\" kept evolving until THEY'D had enough, and after the Let it Be \\"session,\\" even George Martin thought it was over, but THEY didn't want it to end like that, so Paul called George Martin up and said, \\"WE'D like to do another!\\" Even after all that George Martin had seen them accomplish, he wasn't really sure if he or THEY were up to it? Paul said, \\"George, WE'RE SURE, WE'RE going to do one more, WE'RE going to keep this one between just you and us like usual, and things will be okay.\\" Then in spite of ALL of the distractions, turmoil, and tension, they still \\"managed\\" to turn out Abbey Road; then THEY decided it was time to take a break! <br />I'm just going to say that Rubber Soul in one of The Beatles best and most accomplished records; however, that speaks for itself! I was a very young child when they did their last show in the U.S., I'm quite thankful that I was around to see it, because if I hadn't, then perhaps I wouldn't have thought it was possible that just a few very decent and very talented people could change things for the better, by staying focused, behaving properly, and doing something extremly well? On some days, with all of the absolute nonsense and other really bad things going on in the world, well, I NEED to throw on something like Rubber Soul, in order to remind myself that something AS GREAT as The Beatles actually existed! I can understand if The Beatles aren't somebody's favorite or if they aren't their \\"cup of tea,\\" but to not respect all of their achievements, as well as how they did it, well, that I CANNOT understand! Their work belongs up with the stars, and seriously, their \\"work\\" is so good that it shouldn't even be rated by stars or anything else, because it has and will withstand the test of time; just like the \\"work\\" of Mr. Beethoven's has! Yeah, I'll take The Beatles and Beethoven, and MY TEAM would always win, in fact, do it as well as they both did, then people CAN'T stop you even if they wanted to; but what kind of person would want to? They don't come around very often, once in a lifetime if you're fortunate, and GREATNESS like The Beatles is about as GREAT as it gets!
B00005JLYU|3.0|Rude and Crude, Loud and Crass on the outside but gooey as a Marshmallow on the inside, \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" comes screeching onto a million screens this weekend. And Drew Barrymore, Lisa Lui and Cameron Diaz seem to be having loads of fun karate chopping a couple dozen men and one woman: the commandingly sexy Demi Moore, a former Angel gone bad.<br />The Women are beautiful as are the men, the action is feverish and Bernie Mac as the new Bosley is a hoot. And it all adds up to a fun, though empty-headed time.
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-Loused is a mix of rock, electronica, dark funk, and epic poetry. It is a concept album that follows Cerpain Taxt on an epic journey that twists its way through the dark roads of excess, abuse, insanity, and death. This is the best concept album since Pink Floyd's the Wall released nearly 25 years ago. I recommend everyone listen to this masterpiece! I give it 10/10!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This sweet prize for us real anime fans (before it was all &quot;mainstream&quot;) is exactly how I billed it, a sweet prize.<BR>And now ladies and gentleman an average episode by episode review!<br />Final Flight of the Osiris<br />An interesting short; however it only really needed one go. The story that it provided was, indeed, important to the continuity of the Matrix storyline. Yet, it was mostly just showing off the new rendering software. I believe that is enough on that.<br />The Second Renaissance Part I &amp; II<br />These deserve more than their first impression. The information that needs to be conveyed within these shorts its not of the most pleasant nature. While utterly gruesome at moments, it does all have meaning. Watch them through a second time and you'll know what I mean.<br />Kid's Story<br />Ah, the first short by the director of Bebop. A flowing tale with an equally flowing animation style. Probably my favorite of the shorts. A long drawn out story with an amazing conclusion. Although the few people that may be able to relate to this story will possess a deeper understanding. Not to be missed.<br />Program<br />A short, classic clip. Poses ideas upon ideas upon ideas while keeping the visuals very cool. At the minimum you have to admit that the girls hair is awesome. Not to be missed.<br />World Record<br />While some may say the visuals are un-pleasing, I agree with the old saying &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. Seeing as this is a nine minute clip, hand drawn, with 24 frames per/second, I'd say it's worth about twelve million nine hundred and sixty thousand words. That's quite a few. Again, not to be missed (under any circumstances).<br />Beyond<br />One of the most amazing. Poses a glitch in the system that a girl stumbles into. Not to miss.<br />A Detective Story<br />Very classy. I've never actually seen artistically B&amp;W anime before but it is a very nice touch. I'll just call this the Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandand Through the Looking Glass short. It is more the latter though.<br />Matriculated<br />Peter Chung. What more needs to be said. Well other than a review of course. Taking on the feeling of Aeon Flux Matriculated asks a simple question: What happens when a robot is introduced to a human created matrix? And what happens when it falls in love with anti-reality? Not to be missed.<br />To sum it all up The Animatrix requires a certain level of...depth. Not to insult various reviewers *mumble* but this collection should be treated as a set of independent movies, not a mainstream bit. Now while The Matrix offered the independent movie feel it also kept a mainstream feel. You could say that is where this collection is lacking. Bottom Line, if you enjoy Anime (or are an old fan) then buy it. If you've never seen anime but find yourself on IFC all the time, buy it. If both apply, buy the special edition. If neither, *shudder* rent *shudder* it.
068484267X|5.0|ANGELA'S ASHES covers author Frank McCourt's life as a child.  He has vivid memories that start as early as the age of four or five.<br />McCourt is born in Brooklyn, New York.  His father is an alcoholic and can't hold a job or support his family. They return to live in Ireland where his father eventually abandons the family.  Some of McCourt's siblings die.  He faces hunger, illness, death and homelessness.  The family is so poor that they live without the basic necessities that many people take for granted. Yet, they are always kind to others (humans and animals) less fortunate.  When McCourt is 19, he returns to New York City.<br />McCourt describes a lot of touching scenes, like the time his little brother, Michael, brings home a blind greyhound.  Michael sacrifices his supper (bread) to the dog and lets it sleep in the bed that all the children share.  Later they find the dog dead.  His brother is so upset that their mother allows them to stay home from school so that they can have a funeral.<br />Chapter Four is my favorite chapter, where the author describes his experiences in an Irish school - the strict teachers, learning the catechism, his first communion, his first confession, his confirmation, giving his first collection, and watching movies starring James Cagney.<br />McCourt tells his remarkable story, many times with humor. <br />ANGELA'S ASHES is a reminder of the many children in this world who have to grow up in poverty.  Some of those children survive and others don't.  I'm glad that McCourt survived and has shared his touching story with us.<br />Fafa Demasio
B00006RU5B|2.0|I have to admit that the music in this CD is pretty good, but when Chris Cornell's voice comes in, it just totally ruins everything. You're lucky i gave this 2 stars. It should really only have a half star, but i felt i needed to at least give credit to the former Rage members who can actually play music. Chris Cornell, find some other band to screw up with, instead of making these guys listen to your horrible voice.
B0000931OL|5.0|In order to view the 4 bonus tracks, you need to play the cd on the computer, either a PC or a Mac. Plus you need a QuickTime player or any player that plays .mov file. The bonus tracks are live performances taken from MTV. Songs include &quot;Ambulance,&quot; &quot;Out of Time,&quot; &quot;Crazy Beat,&quot; and &quot;Caravan.&quot; <br />If you don't have a player, you'll end up seeing a cube with a red X after clicking on play. Just make sure to download a player that can play .mov files.<br />In addition, there is a hidden track called &quot;Me White Noise.&quot; It is located before &quot;Ambulance.&quot; Only way to access is to rewind the cd player. Only problem with this is that some cd players do not allow rewinding before the first track! <br />Overall, this is a great cd to have as part of the Blur collection.
B000059HCI|4.0|I think the title refers to the American dream, where you get a good job, buy a nice house and raise a nice family. That dream is over or never existed for the people in this show. The movie can be said to make many statements, but the one it made for me more than any other is: What makes people turn to drugs? Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are four people who's lives seem empty and bordering on despair. Harry, Marion and Tyrone love to get high, with heroin being their favorite escape. Harry's mom, who's hooked on television and mistakenly thinks she's going to be on her favorite program wants to lose weight and becomes addicted to diet pills. She loses weight but becomes emaciated in the process, starts hallucinating, and seems to be losing her mind. Harry warns her of the dangers of taking all these \\"uppers\\" (he ought to know) but it falls on deaf ears. Things are going good for Harry, Marion and Tyrone for awhile but things dry up and coming down is painful. They are so hooked that they're willing to do things they wouldn't normally do just to get a fix. At the end of the show it's hard to decide who to feel the most sorry for. All four of their lives have become a virtual hell. Maybe the best statement this show makes is: No matter how hopeless your life may seem, drugs aren't the answer. In the end they leave you worse off than you were before you started. The soundtrack is piercing at times, but fits with the context of the movie. A disturbing film but brilliantly crafted.
0393317552|5.0|Which civilization will be more productive, technologically advanced and ultimately politically dominant: a hundred ethnicities lined up East to West; or a hundred ethnicities arrayed North to South? This, in essence, is the compelling and original question that Jared Diamond asks, and answers, in this absolutely required-reading 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner.<br />On page 87, the chart entitled \\"Factors Underlying the Broadest Pattern of History\\" outlines Diamond's entire case. Due to weather patterns, continental shape, and topographical variation, the band of cultures arranged along the Eastwest axis from Portugal to Vietnam had a superior starting point compared to those cultures stretching Northsouth from Alaska to Chile or from the Sudan to South Africa.<br />As humans evolved from hunter-gatherers to farmers, food surpluses enabled for the first time a segment of society to do something other than scrounge for their next protein hit. Increases in food storage and food production enabled ever greater specialization: \\"stored food can also feed priests, who provide religious justification for wars of conquest; artisans such as metal workers, who develop swords, guns and other technologies and scribes, who preserve far more information than can be remembered accurately.\\" New technologies are produced by this thinking-inventing class; both by trial and error and by sustained experimentation, new methods, inventions, processes, weapons, and philosophies are brought forth into the world.<br />By showing that innovations occur, independently, in every race and culture -- \\"the myriad factors affecting innovativeness make the historian's task paradoxically easier, by converting societal variation in innovativeness into essentially a random variable\\" - Diamond is able to sidestep charges, should one be so inclined (and many ones are inclined so) of racial determinism. <br />So in each of these areas, as societies independently produce innovations in guns, germs or steel, they share or trade them with their neighbors. For the Eastwesters, this is easy because the climate from Portugal to Vietnam is rather similar, broadly speaking. For the Northsoutherners, however, the crops and mammals that thrive in the American plains or the Andes wither in the Guatemalan heat and vice versa. Therefore, trade and the exchange of ideas are hampered.<br />And thus, geography is destiny.<br />The wheel, invented by the Eastwest crew in 3,000 BC diffuses rapidly within a few centuries. Invented independently in prehistoric Mexico, it never makes it to the Andes (Diamond cites the throttling power of the narrow Panama isthmus, though I wonder why does a narrow landmass throttle diffusion and not accelerate it?) In another example, writing zips rapidly across Eurasia while it languishes with the Mayas in the Americas.<br />Similarly, with food: \\"of the world's 148 big wild terrestrial herbivore mammals - the candidates for domestication - only 14 passed the test. Why did the other 134 species fail?\\"  Eurasia ends up with 13 of them, the Americas 1, sub-Saharan Africa and Australia - zero<br />And as a result of food - disease. Eurasian crowd diseases evolved out of the diseases of Eurasian herd animals. And a lack of these mammals in the New World led to a paucity of disease (the author includes an interesting sidenote on why llamas are not a source of human disease). Most wars prior to World War II were won by the side spreading nastier germs (a novel and not entirely convincing argument - were the Mongols, with their small core of Mongolians surrounding by an ever-expanding army of conscripts, really able to direct their germs at the enemy and not their own troops?) And European diseases eliminated 95 percent of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas within two centuries of arrival.<br />So geography is destiny and in the area of invention, food, and disease, Eastwest orientation is superior to Northsouth.<br />Even within Eastwest, we find geography has implications:<br />\\"Europe has a highly indented coastline with five large peninsulas that approach islands in their isolation [and thus] Europe is carved up into independent linguistic, ethnic and political units by high mountains\\"<br />While \\"China's coastline is much smoother\\" with no bifurcating ranges separating tribes and generating animosities, dialects, separate ethnic identities, or, importantly, sharable innovation.<br />Call this Diamond's Contiguous China theory: Europe's disunity leads to experimentation (Columbus asks five different regents to support his voyages before one will support him) while the Chinese monolith ends its voyages of discovery in 1421 due to court intrigue.<br />Perhaps Diamond's Contiguous China theory has implications for writing systems as well. Writing always starts as pictographs. In the Mediterranean, these symbols, forced into contact with many different pronunciations, syllables, diphthong and accents lost all but their most basic phonemic essence. \\"Alphabets apparently arose only once\\" in Syria and were then borrowed, copied, co-opted and diffused throughout the Eastwest axis. While Chinese characters, which gradually expanded along with the monolithic linguistic-political area (even though ultimately that monolith sprouts wholly different languages, the process is gradual enough to not rupture the writing system in the interim) had no such stripping away. And thus Chinese has several thousand characters, each idiosyncratically replete with meaning; while the few dozen Western characters are meaningless of themselves and merely phonemic.<br />Perhaps the best evidence of Diamond's deftness of touch is the complete absence of opprobrium for the author since publication of what is after all, an explanation of why Europeans and Asians succeeded and Africans and Native Americans didn't. Even rational, dispassionate treatises on topics tangentially touching race tend to produce a singular level of venom and vitriol from the shouting classes. Diamond so smoothly handles these sensitive issues, head on, that there is simply no race-baiting angle from which to attack him.<br />Indeed, the differences in outcome are attributed not to race, ethnicity, genes, culture or any other factor inherent to these groups at all, but rather surprisingly and benignly, to the geographical orientation of one's neighbors! A more arbitrary, non-threatening explanation for observed differences in national success would be difficult to conceive. And for that, the modern, liberally minded student, the originality, rigor, scope and truth of Diamond's thesis is all the sweeter.
B000001AI7|5.0|Young Michael Jackson at his best.<BR>After this his first solo album, you knew that he was going to be<BR>a star (a superstar).  Some of my favorites are &quot;Girl Don't Take Your Love From Me&quot;, &quot;Maria (You Were The Only One)&quot; and &quot;In Our Small Way&quot;  made this an album that I had to listen to over and over again.  Any true Micheal Jackson fans need this one in their collection.
6305127638|5.0|MY REVIEW.  Star Trek movie rank #2 of 10.  Frakes did a great job with a very busy script here.  I was tempted to make this my #1 favorite Star trek movie, but Wrath of khan won out.  Within my family though this is the children favorite ST movie.  The borg are cool.  They like the Obe Dobe song.  They love the \\"Mean Queen\\".  Stewart is terrific as Picard, and I will miss him in future ST movies.  Maybe frakes can pick it up.  Or how about some movies about Captain Archer!
B00000JCB2|5.0|When Limp Bizkit released 3 Dollar Bill Y'all, it was a warning to what was about to hit the music world. Not yet known too much, but that CD was great and featured tracks to help put the boys from Jacksonville on the map in &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Counterfeit&quot;. Then in 1999, Limp Bizkit became huge with the help of their first single off this CD &quot;Nookie&quot;. At the release of this CD I was entering my mid-teens, and to hear something this fresh was unbelievable. The world of boy bands and pop music were seeking to ruin all of music, but with the release of this CD the aspiration to destroy everything else and bring in the new wave had begun. On this CD, Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit illustrates his feelings and advice and pours them into his songs, which feature great hard rock sounds but in some way a hip-hop twist. It has only been 4 years since the release of this CD, but it could very well possibly have an impact of that of say a Led Zeppelin. There style wasn't exactly original, but they sure did perfect it with this CD. Afterwards, Limp followed this CD up with another great one in Chocalate Starfish and the Hot Dog Falvored Water. (By the way, I don't even mention New Old Songs, and Limp Bizkit the band, in the same sentence). This CD is a must have to all hard rock fans and music fans, it will go down as a classic.
0780020685|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. I sat through the three hour length reading the subtitles and it seemed to go by too quickly, it was so entertaining
0767819179|5.0|This is NOT an ugly duckling story.  The whole point is that he fell in love with her before she turned beautiful. This is one of my favorite movies of all times!  The relationship with her mother is huge. Again, her thinking her mother did not accept her because she wasn't the pretty one but in reality, her mother was jealous of her, that she didn't need it like she did, to feel secure.
B000006TRV|5.0|One of the most brilliant albums of all time, The Wall re-enforces the far more guitar driven Floyd of Animals.  As with most double albums, the first disc is much heavier and contains brilliant songs like In the Flesh, the Another Brick in the Wall trilogy, Young Lust, and Don't Leave Me Now.  It does not outshine the second disc however, which contains brilliant ballads such as Hey You, Is There Anybody Out There, Comfortably Numb, and Run Like Hell.  This was the last Pink Floyd album in which Roger Waters and David Gilmour were partners in crime and it's an amazing listen.  The Wall is a little over eighty minutes of the late-seventies/early-eighties progressive rock Pink Floyd is known for.  This is no Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here.  This is the hard rock album that would most likely influence not only the progressive alterntive rock movements of the nineties (Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead) but the gothic industrial movement as well (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson).
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek movie rank 3rd of 10.  Captain, there be whales! <BR> Coming off a poorly done movie The Search for Spock, Nimoy also directed Voyage Home.  When I first saw it I was disappointed.  I imaged the producers and writers saying: Lets see, Nimoy has a makeup problem.  He has to direct and get those pointed ears put on.  Lets have our heros go through time to present day earth and Spook can wear a stocking cap over his ears avoiding the need to sit through makeup.  Plus we save money on sets!<br />  <BR>This movie was also made shortly after the final disasterous episode of Battlestar Galactica.  After two week of hype that the crew of BG was finally coming home to earth, they arrive and the nazi's had won WWII.  Not only did they not have expense of of the cool sci fi sets, the script was so stupid that the showed died.  <br />Well, all this was in play in my initial reaction to STIV the voyage home.  But over the years it had become my second favorite ST movie, dropping to 3rd with the release of First Contact.   This was a movie of action and humor that has become one of my favorite movie period.  This is also a star trek movie that the whole family likes.  So, even though Mr Nimoy gave us a turkey in ST3, they gave him a second chance and he delivered BIG.  Way to go Leonard, may I call you Leonard?
B000077VPU|1.0|I don't own this DVD but based on the reviews I will not be purchasing it.  I orginally taped this concert when it was on MTV years ago.  Because my TV was a piece of junk at the time, the sound quality was terrible but I still have the tape.  I ended up buying the official VHS tape when they released it but found that they had edited out some of the things that were shown on MTV when the concert first aired.  Overall the VHS release still kicks... but I was somewhat disappointed.  Now it sounds like they have edited out even more for the DVD.  I am writing because I would like to see a multiple DVD un-edited version of this concert in it's entirety.  I don't care what it costs.  Put everything in there.  People will buy it.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Dude this movie rocked but the ending [was] really bad. I mean it felt so abrupt u almost forget how good the rest of it is. But as I saw last night at the movies seeing 28 Days Later(great movie with a good ending) they are making a sequel so thats cool. The first half hour as many have said was GREAT and the rest was really cool so definitly see this if u like horror movies and the only bad thing about it is the ending. Hope U Like it,Later
B0000931OG|5.0|After hearing how this latest offering by Blur was less than desirable due to Graham Coxon's departure, I was worried that Blur may have begun some downward spiral.  How wrong was I??<br />Those that have said &quot;Think Tank&quot; is unlike their previous material and therefore wasn't up to par really cannot appreciate growth and change great bands go through.  If you want the same sound over and over, continue to listen to your American Idols and Dave Matthew's Band whose only staying power is that it's generic enough to appeal to the widest of audiences.<br />Blur is for serious music lovers craving the passion and poetry that sets them apart from the &quot;artist de jour&quot; that some executive decided to promote due to their mass appeal.  I can't say enough how enriching Blur is for this music junkie.  To try and highlight specific tracks from Think Tank is difficult, but I immediately took to Ambulance, Out of Time, and Sweet Song.  Damon Albarn's sultry voice could melt steel!!<br />The trademark Blur sound survives in spite of Coxon's departure, but they have also matured keeping their fans satisfied with unique offerings.  This is yet another &quot;must have&quot; for true Blur followers.
B00000AFGM|5.0|In my opinion, this is Manson's best album.  It is the least raw album they have ever put out, complete with layers of digital sounding guitars and synthesizers.  Great Big White World and Coma White, the opening and the close, are the greatest songs on the album.  This electronic noises will take you to soundscapes that have not been rivaled by any other Manson album (the closest is probably Holywood).  Rock is Dead, The Dope Show, and Dissacociative clearly stand out.  Mechanical Animals is probably my third favorite album of all time and is the greatest album of its kind, whatever that is.  Apart from the music which is superbly unique and amazing, it also deserves five stars for one of the most amazing album covers ever conceived.
B00000ILBK|2.0|MY REVIEW.  Star Trek movie rank 7th of 10.  OK.  We know that Patrick Stewart is a big time liberal over there in the land of English socialism.  Rodenberry was a conservative libertarian.  Hey there is room for everyone in the world, even in the world of Star Trek.  But this time they raised eyebrows.  Let me Explain.<br />Before we know that the bad guys are bad guys here is what happens.  A solar system has the secret to eliminate death, disease and suffering.  But tests must be run and to do that a small group of settlers must be moved.  Settlers mind you, not the \\"forever, indigenous residents\\" of the planet.  Picard goes nuts and takes up arms to support the settlers against the orders of a superior officer and against the approval of star fleet.  Only after starting a court martial offense, to prevent to discovery of the cure for aging and disease does Picard learn that the Star fleet admiral has been duped and that the experimenters are bad guys with ulterior motives.  New age idealism is one thing.  But here Picard weighed the conflicting ideas of settlers keeping their homes vs the permanent end to aging and disease and went with the settlers?!  Huh?  Isn't that like defending a settler farmer who wants to ploy up a field where the cure for cancer is growing before tests can be run to see why the current plant cures cancer?<br />Once you get past the idea our heroes are defending an absurdity, the rest of the movie is well. Done.  The scenery in this film is spectacular.  The special effects are impressive.  It just that the main premise for the story is stupid.
6302759110|1.0|I really don't know how any true Dracula fan could recomend this insipid vastly overrated waste of film. Every thing about this miserable version is objectionable, from the crass and misleading title that implies a faithfulness to the original source material (though actually this film disregards the original Bram Stoker story in favor of a hoary long lost \\"love\\" romance theme!?) to the uninspired acting and ill concieved production design. This film has no mood or ambiance (not to mention scares!)at all but is chock full of trite Mtv style flash filmmaking technique that completely works against the depiction of victorian era England (which is not convincingly evoked at all!} In fact some of the depictions in this thing are hilariously ludicrous (Vlad \\"impaling a victim single handedly,his \\"crazy\\" shadows, Drac's head sticking out of dirt on the boat!). A true failure and disapointment especially coming from the man who directed the Godfather and Apocalypse Now! Stick with the old lugosi/Lee classics or better yet check out Murnau and Herzog's Nosferatus and Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers (or the BBC production with Louis Jordan). Coppolla's Dracula doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as these films, even the Frank Langella version is better!
B000002UUX|5.0|thrash metal at its finest, if you like metal you just gotta love this album its a classic maybe the best ever thrash album.\m/
B000002UDB|5.0|This is perhaps the most unique album put out by any band, ever.  No matter how many times one listens to it, it is impossible not to be enthralled, mystified and delighted by its childishness, fluidity and magically blended sound.  Each and every song on here is completely unique and painstakingly produced, giving each one the power to convey its message and atmosphere perfectly.  (Flying and Penny Lane are perhaps the two most appropriately titled songs ever recorded.)  <BR>    It can, in a way, be compared to Pink Floyd's Wish You were Here, if only in that it is next in line after a musical landmark by its band, and comes off just as good as its predecessor. <BR>Each Beatle gives outstanding contributions, (George's Blue Jay Way and Paul's Fool on the Hill are especially creative and original) but John, in particular, poured his heart and soul into this album, giving us three of the most powerful songs the Beatles ever created: I am the Walrus, (which somehow manages to become a powerful epic and a mindless rant at the same time), the heart-stopping Strawberry Fields Forever (perhaps the album's best, despite the song's somewhat anticlimactic ending), and the unforgettable All You Need is Love, (recorded on film for an audience of two hundred million in a single take!)  The power of his lyrics and his penetrating, all-powerful voice on this album prove just how important John Lennon was.<BR>   This was the Beatles at their creative peak, and, though perhaps not truly an album as much as a somewhat commercialized soundtrack, is the greatest collection of nonstop perfection ever put together by the Beatles, including, in my humble opinion, Sgt. Pepper.
B000003TAR|4.0|This and Nevermind are my two favorite Nirvana albums.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are the most mature and brilliant in this album.  The constant metaphors related to the body and medicine are reminiscent of great poets like Jim Morrison and Roger Waters.  Even Cobain's guitar playing slightly improved in songs like Serve the Servants (and the b-side Moist Vagina).  Though songs like Rape Me and Pennyroyal Tea are disappointing in the simplicity of their structure, songs like Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, All Apologies, and Milk It provide much more complex and interesting guitar riffs.  Heart-Shaped Box and Scentless Apprentice are two of my favorite songs, and even though they are simple, they are better than Cobain pounding away on power chords like Tourette's and Nevermind's Drain You.  Simple and limited, this is no Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
B0000683DH|5.0|MY REVIEW.  Rank #1 of 10.  A sequel to a TV episode.  How often does a bad movie have a sequel that is a vast improvement over the first movie.  Well it happened here.  In fact the second ST movie is my number 1 ST movie ever, though first contact was a temping alternate choice.  But, if WOK had been a second dude, would that have been the end of star trek?  I am glad we will never know.  Shatner is great in this and Montalban may have had his best role as khan in this movie.  We also learn the secret of kirks success in cheating death.  He CHEATS DEATH by the book.
B00003CXXI|5.0|SHREK IS A FANTASTIC FILM TO WATCH.   ONE YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF RECULTANTLY WATCHING FOR YOUR KIDS, AND THEN SNEAKING AROUND AT TWO IN THE MORNING TO WATCH AGAIN.  I JUST LOVED THE COLORFUL AND COMICAL CHARECTERS IN SHREK.  DONKEY, PLAYED BY EDDIE MURPHY, IS THE HIT OF THE MOVIE, AS HIS ENDLESS RAMBELS ARE REALLY FUNNY.SHREK CAN ALSO MAKE YOU LAUGH, BUT IN A DIFFRENT SORT OF WAY.  LORD FARQUAD'S CHARECTER MIGHT COME A BIT &quot;SHORT&quot; HOWEVER(WATCH THE MOVIE AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN.)  BUT ALL AND ALL THIS IS A GREAT FILM FOR ALL AGES.  YOU GET SOME LAUGHS, SOME SENTIMENTLE STUFF, AND A FIRE BREATHING DRAGON, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?
B00006SFBD|5.0|these guys simply cant screw up, each track beholds brilliance only opeth could have.  After seeing these guys live they are my favorite band and may be for a long time to come.  10/5 stars, maybe my favorite album ever. \m/
B00006F2TV|2.0|Actually I feel sorry for all those people chasing after vintage comics and memorbilia. It won't take to long for the bottom of this franchise to fall apart and people receiving that garbage go broke at its small value.<br />Now for my review.<br />The special effects were ok though I expected a little bit more. The actors for Spiderman and co were lousy. In fact the movie is sort based on the comic book with important details left out at a fast pace. The villian, Ha! As if you call it a villian! The Green Goblin was introduced in such a silly way only those who've read the comicbook knows whats going on. Others who watched this movie out of the blue will be clueless on who is who. Anyway believe it or not when I saw this at the theater with my diehard Spiderman fan stepdad several people of all ages including us were laughing at the Green Goblin's first appearance to the big screen. My God he looked like a Power Ranger gone bad. Or better yet a lifesize reject of a Toy Story villian. And that mask! It's look like someone dug it out the dumpster across the street a week after Halloween to be used for the film. You can even see Osbourne's lips showing from the fake plastic gaping mouth. (Doesn't anyone else agree?) Throughout the movie whenever the G.G showed up on a suped up surf board (probbably swiped it from Lara Croft's (Tomb Raider) broom closet) and zooming around in the air and screeching out diologe that would come from middle schoolers during a routeen game of \\"Capture The Flag\\" that same group of people that kept growing larger by each G.G sequences were snickering and laughed while trying to avoid junkfood being thrown at us by overhead viewers obviously annoyed at the movie and decides to take their wrath out on us. Anyway at the last G.G scene at least ten people loose it and rush to the bathroom. For my opinion \\"Greeny\\" should be considered the stupidest looking villian ever. A guy dressed as the Riddler wearing a pink tu-tu would get better ratings Asfor Spiderman himself. they could've done a lot more better with the actor, scenes, etc. So I've heard that a second one is coming out and talk of third one is floating around. Great I get to see son of Green Goblin or whatever faceoff with a \\"Human Spider\\" I rated this movie two stars cause Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage makes an appearance!
B000024D4R|5.0|It is a common misconception of people interested in Pink Floyd to purchase only Dark Side and The Wall.  The albums in between (Wish You Were Here and Animals) are heavily under-represented.  The Wall would not have been without the Pink Floyd's progression into the guitar-driven sound of Animals.  Dogs is probably my favorite song ever written: it is a seventeen minute opus that drags you across thick layers of electronic guitar, acoustic guitar, and synthesizers.  Though one would originally percieve a seventeen minute song to be quite draining to the listener, Waters' superb songwriting--composing--keeps you listening.  Pigs is another powerful song that allows you to hear Waters' angst with the money-driven capitalist and fascist goverments of the first world... I wonder what he would have thought of Bush's war in Iraq.  Sheep is another brilliant ten minute song that cries out against conformity while declaring that conformity is our only option for survival.  Buy Animals and then read Orwell's Animal Farm.  Along with The Wall, this is Waters' deepest album and along with any given Floyd album since seventy one, this has greatly influenced and impacted modern music as we know it.

B00009V7T2|5.0|It relieves me to the highest to hear such a spectacular album come out in the midst of what I think is one of the dullest times in music. I must say this is one of, if not, the best album to come out in the last 5 years.<BR>I'm a pretty big progressive rock fan. Not many of today's underground prog bands however, do anything for me. They all sound like they're trying to be the next Yes or Genesis, and they water it down too and sound corny. The Mars Volta on the other hand, do prog rock right, but they're not just prog. Think Pink Floyd meets '70's Santana meets At the Drive In (well duh!) meets Led Zeppelin meets King Crimson. <BR>The result of this insane mixture of sounds comes out sounding nothing short of incredible.<BR>I suggest that anybody who has a great love of music buy this album. It may take a couple of listens to get it, but it's well worth the time. You will not regret it.
B00004I9VE|5.0|This is Mr. Jackson's greatest album, and one of my personal favourites 1. Wanna be startin' somethin': An amazing track which I love, and which I always listen to 2. Baby be mine: a wonderful song probably few peole see to its full extent, I personally love this softish song 3. The girl is mine: A wonderful song, and a great duet. 4. Thriller: An amazing song, which I love, specially the rap by Vincent Price, a wonderful rythmn and beat 5. Beat it: Great rock and roll and great song 6. Billie jean: This is the song, THE song. The greatest song, and the most demanded, incredible 7. Human Nature: Mesmerizing softie, with breathtaking lyrics 8. P.Y.T: Poppy song, which in my opinion, can be a bit better. Anyway, I really like this song 9. The Lady in my life: I love this song, except the end part, but a great closing song.<BR>This album is greatly recommended to everyone, of every taste
B000006NPY|5.0|Indeed, Adore began a new era for the Pumpkins.  With the arrest and departure of Jimmy Chamberlain, the band was forced to make a change.  Not that it wasn't obvious from the band's first three albums that a change was coming.  Each album became progressively more personal for Billy Corgan.  Simply compare the first singles from each album.  Mellon Collie's Bullet With Butterfly Wings definitely possessed much more raw emotion and depth than Siamese Dream's Cherub Rock and especially Gish's Siva.  Adore surpasses even Mellon Collie in this way.  It is in some ways an anti-rock statement but not entirely.  Songs like Ava Adore, Daphne Descends, Tear, and Pug rock hard... with or without guitars.  It is the energy and personality of the Pumpkins that has always made them great, not the loudness of their guitars.  This was obvious with the beautiful ballads delivered to us between the heavy alternative rockers of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.  This album has personality, as all Pumpkins albums do, and no Pumpkin collection is complete without this beautifully dark aspect of Billy Corgan's brilliance.  Let him open up to you as you listen.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Psychodelic movies were popular once.  OOOoo.  Look at the pretty swirling colors... Man merging with machine...  Far out.  <br />In 1966, as freshman in a 12 story college dorm with only 2 tv rooms in the basement, one had to arrive real early on Monday nights for the next installment of STAR TREK the TV series.  I was hooked and have been ever since.  Years later when they made the first movie, I was there in line to see it the first day.  The movie started out well enough with the Klingons attacking a cloud.  The movie moved along with the gathering of the crew.  Then it struck me that I had seen this all before.  They had remade the Vger episode from the TV show and merged it with 2001 Space Odyssey!  Dah!! Did I feel cheated.<br />I know a lot of you like this first episode and the newer directors cut, but I fall on the side of those that argue that this is the first and the worst of the 10 star trek movies.  With so much competition for worst movie, I decided this one was it.  OK, maybe numbers 3 or 5?  No, this one is the worst.<br />As for the Goldsmith score, come on, who goes to a sci fi movie for the music.  The score is important but is only 4th in priority for a movie.  How about a good story as being the most important?  <br />I liked Steven Collins in Tales of the Gold Monkey, but here, he walked a line real close to getting a court marshall charge.   Sir, permission to speak.  I would have said:  \\"NO.  Shutup, I'm Admiral Kirk, the greatest star fleet Ship Commander ever, and you will step down and follow orders mister\\".  I am a hugh Shatner fan.  His 1st six ST books are the best of the bunch.  I read most of his Tek War books, and I highly recommend them.<br />But back to the future and star trek, I rank this 10th out of 10.
0385509456|4.0|Christopher Boone, the hopelessly logical yet haplessly clueless narrator of this novel, is a truly unique literary creation. Although brimming with insight when it comes to maths and sciences he becomes clumsy and awkward whenever faced with an unfamiliar social situation or place. You see there's a twist to Christopher that makes him unlike all other narrators: he is a 15 year old boy suffering from autism. Reading this book allows the reader to have a glimpse of his life and how his mind works. The genius and utter realism of this feat lies with the author, who treats the matter with great respect but sometimes brutal honesty. When made uncomfortable Christopher may have a temper tantrum, groan loudly or even lash out with his fists. But it is impossible not to find him likable because Haddon makes you see that this is only part of who he is and shows all of his other attributes as well. A truly 3 dimensional character is hard to find but you need look no further for one. The book's premise is that after a neighbor's dog is killed Christopher decides to do some detective work like Sherlock Holmes (his favorite character). This investigation is an unexpected catalyst in Christopher's life, and he soon finds his strenuously organized existence spiralling out of control. It's really about an intelligent, complex boy awash in a world he cannot understand or control. He is surrounded by many intense emotions and actions and though he can recite thousands of prime numbers he is at a loss to explain them. This book is a joy to read and a heartfelt reminder that we can get over our own obstacles. You won't be forgetting Christopher Boone any time soon.

B000003TA4|4.0|Nevermind is Nirvana's best album along with In Utero, leaving one album left I suppose.  Smells Like Teen Spirit remains one hell of a song as with Come as you Are.  Soft songs like Something in the Way and Lounge Act also fill the void.  This is Nirvana's most pop-oriented album which is most likely why it sounds so fresh.  It is a typical Butch Vig recording.  This album, however, is limited to the guitar playing talents of Kurt Cobain, which is that of a seventeen year old high school drop-out.  The songs are completely simple and limited in song structure (which is why Cobain originally intented to name each of his albums Verse Chorus Verse).  After all, he is no Billy Corgan or Trent Reznor.  The album, though amazing the first few times around, grows boring and listless as musical maturity develops.  For the years we spend as angsty teenagers, however, this album is well worth listening to.  I suppose it only gets four stars because Nirvana's lack of technique would lead to the ultimate death of rock and the reign of emo and punk.  If you don't think Nirvana's popularity has led to the disappointing music of today, read his suicide note or his journals.  Kurt Cobain knew, afterall, his own limitations and how overrated he had become.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek movie rank 3rd of 10.  Captain, there be whales!<br /> Coming off a poorly done movie The Search for Spock, Nimoy also directed Voyage Home.  When I first saw it I was disappointed.  I imaged the producers and writers saying: Lets see, Nimoy has a makeup problem.  He has to direct and get those pointed ears put on.  Lets have our heros go through time to present day earth and Spook can wear a stocking cap over his ears avoiding the need to sit through makeup.  Plus we save money on sets!<br /><br />This movie was also made shortly after the final disasterous episode of Battlestar Galactica.  After two week of hype that the crew of BG was finally coming home to earth, they arrive and the nazi's had won WWII.  Not only did they not have expense of of the cool sci fi sets, the script was so stupid that the showed died.<br />Well, all this was in play in my initial reaction to STIV the voyage home.  But over the years it had become my second favorite ST movie, dropping to 3rd with the release of First Contact.  This was a movie of action and humor that has become one of my favorite movie period.  This is also a star trek movie that the whole family likes.  So, even though Mr Nimoy gave us a turkey in ST3, they gave him a second chance and he delivered BIG.  Way to go Leonard, may I call you Leonard?
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is one of like 3 or 4 screen adaptations of Stephen King novels I can tolerate. I consider this to be the best. Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White! Piper Laurie IS her crazy mother! They shine in this classic battle between kids and parents, cultural norms vs. religious fanaticism, and knowledge vs. ignorance. Carrie is growing up. She experiences her first period and is humiliated by her entire gym class (who \\"stone\\" her with pads), due to the fact that her psycho-preacher mom  never explained the simple facts of life to her. Such things are far too \\"sinful\\" to even mention. Well, along with puberty comes a power that enables Carrie to move things with her mind. Slowly, we realize that this power is awesome and dangerous. This is not so much a spook show about telekinesis, as it is a tragedy. Most people know the story about the prom, the pig's blood, Mom's kitchen crucifixion, etc. In the book, Carrie personified the awkwardness and misery suffered by the \\"outsider\\" in teen life. Sissy Spacek made the role her own. The intensity of her eyes during the final holocaust is incredible! Brian DePalma handled the direction with honesty, humor, and complete terror. An impressive film. Bonus- Check out the young John Travolta and Nancy Allen as the king and queen of slime! Amy Irving is great too! Also, see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in a funny hat! ...
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best films I have ever seen.  The director does a great job of showing the story of Roxie and Vel.  I can't say much more about it. It is comparable to Moulin Rouge, but with a stupendously better soundtrack.  All songs contained within Chicago are originals for the stage version, although a few songs were lowered a key or two so that Catherine and Reneé could really belt them.<br />As for some of the reviewers, specifically the one who said this is a a horrible new musical.  I am sorry to say you have been misinformed.  Firstly, this is certainly not a new musical.  It has been around for decades.  Also, it does not celebrate the murders.  In case you don't know, there is something called a farce, and Chicago is exactly that.  They use these overblown stories (i.e. The Cell Block Tango) to show what life was like in the roaring twenties.  Much like F. Scott Fitzgerald did when he wrote The Great Gatsby.<br />To wrap it up, I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is beyond great, I also recommend you buy the soundtrack - not only to the movie, but also to the original stage version and the '96 revival.  Buy them all and enjoy.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie remains, to this day, my favorite album of all time.  This isn't about Corgan whining for attention or seeking some kind of sympathy.  This album is about adolescence and the adolescent in all of us.  This album has songs that are sad, angry, wistful, and happy.  There are joyful, majestic melodies like Tonight Tonight, 1979, and Here is No Why.  There are angry rockers such as Bullet With Butterfly Wings, An Ode to No One, and X.Y.U.  Likewise, there are nihilist, much more apathetic songs such as Zero, Bodies, and Thru the Eyes of Ruby.  Incredibly sad and depressing songs include To Forgive, Stumbleine, and Porcelina.  This, however, is not due to pretentious motives but Corgan's vision of accurately expressing the fickle heart of the adolescent, his own inner child, and the wide spectrum of human emotions we deal with every day.  Listening to Mellon Collie is like listening to the soul of the teenager in all of us, and this could only be accomplished in an album over two hours long!  It should also be of interest that this album contradicts all major patterns of music marketing today.  A double album after such a huge success as Siamese Dream is considered commercial suicide.  Only the Pumpkins could pull this off and create the best-selling double record of all time.  This album is a huge musical statement and completely defines the dying alternative rock of the nineties better than any other album or band.  If only I could communicate my thanks and gratitude to Billy Corgan for the effects this album has had on my life (other than the twenty dollars I gave to Virgin for the record).
B00005JKHP|2.0|OOOoo.  Look at the swirling colors... Man merging with machine...  Far out.  In 1966, as freshman in a 12 story college dorm with only 2 tv rooms in the basement, one had to arrive real early on Monday nights for the next installment of STAR TREK the TV series.  I was hooked and have been ever since.  Years later when they made the first movie, I was there in line to see it the first day.  The movie started out well enough with the Klingons attacking a cloud.  The movie moved along with the gathering of the crew.  Then it struck me that I had seen this all before.  They had remade the Vger episode from the TV show and merged it with 2001 Space Odyssey!  Dah, did I feel cheated.<br />I know a lot of you like this first episode and the newer directors cut, but I fall on the side of those that argue that this is the first and the worst of the 10 star trek movies.  With so much competition for worst movie, I decided this one was it.  <br />As for the Goldsmith score, come on, who goes to a sci fi movie for the music.  The score is important but is only 4th in priority for a movie.<br />I liked Steven Collins in Tales of the Gold Monkey, but here, he walked a line real close to getting a court marshall charge.   Sir, permission to speak.  I would have said:  \\"NO.  Shutup, I'm Admiral Kirk, the greatest star fleet Ship Commander ever, and you will step down and follow orders mister\\".  I am a hugh Shatner fan.  His 1st six ST books are the best of the bunch.  I read most of his Tek War books, and I highly recommend them.<br />You know who liked this movie a lot more than I did.  My acid dropping buddies.  It was psychedelic.  What a trip.  The swirling color, Collins merging with a machine, wow.  Boring if you are sober or not tripping.  I rank this 10th out of 10.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'll admit, I bought this disc on the strength of the heavy-rotation single &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; which causes the group to be confused with some of the modern metal outfits out there.  It's really not.  The general feel of the album is a dark instrumental groove under the hauntingly beautiful voice of Amy Lee.  The sound has a lot of electronical influence to it, and the way it meshes with Lee's vocals is what makes Evanescence sound fresh in a rather cynical era of musical acts.<br />The harder-edged cuts on the album are generally fairly good, but it really shines in the middle:  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a perfect ballad for Amy Lee's voice, &quot;Haunted&quot; just really sticks out with great sound work, and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is even more chilling.  You'll hear a lot of &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; but it's the kind of song that can bear up to that level of exposure fairly well, and (save for the rapping) it's not too jarring when compared to the rest of the album.  If there's a problem with the album, it's that a number of the later tracks are less distinctive than the earlier material.  And I have to say:  I think the lyrics are above par for the kind of &quot;dark&quot; lyric writing that's in vogue today.<br />I think Evanescence is going to go somewhere, and so it's worth checking out where they've really hit the scene.  If you enjoy &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; I think you'll get a lot out of &quot;Fallen.&quot;  If nothing else, you'll get a longer, deeper taste of Amy Lee's amazing vocals.
034544678X|5.0|Use 1-word commands. Primates are bigger than dogs. Well, yeah. But start training a dog and all the good stuff you just know flies out the window. This book was full of common sense, insight, and experience presented with love and humor. It's an entertaining book in itself, but halfway through I found myself with one miserably unhappy little dog who was quickly learning the power of aggression for keeping people out of his face. Everywhere I turned for help I found less hope for him, but I took some of the book's advice and had some faith and now he's happy, secure, loving and even outgoing at times. No one believes me anymore when I say he used to be shy, and he's a joy to know. That's my teary testimonial. This book can change lives.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow! I must say this has to be one of my favorite albums ever! Yes I must admit that I was a Christina fan from her 'Genie' days and am glad she evolved from this pop-driven diva to a creative matured artist! (You go girl!) The album from beginning to end is very diverse she adds many influences from guitar-driven \\"Fighter\\" to salsa-dancing \\"Infatuation\\" to a haunting ballad \\"Walk Away\\". She show she's grown up not only as a person but musically, creating a well-written pop album. Although some songs such as \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\", and \\"Underappreciated\\" are still very much pop-saturated the album still is very good. If you get a chance to hear her song \\"I Will Be\\" which was not featured on Stripped, (but should've been!) you'll see her artistry at its best! VERY GOOD ALBUM! A MUST HAVE! Key Tracks: \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Impossible\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Make Over\\", \\"I'm OK\\"
B0000683DH|5.0|To this day, &quot;Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan&quot; is still the best Star Trek movie ever made, thanks to superb direction by Nicholas Meyer, Richard Montalban's masterful performance as the revenge-filled Khan and a script that is intellectual, but never delves into the world of dweebiness.  <br />Director Meyer had to win over a lot of jaded trekkies after the first Star Trek movie sharply divided them into two camps: those that liked the movie and those that did not.  However, Meyer fought through the muck not only to reunite the trekkies, but also impress and win-over many non-treksters as well with a mix of imaginative special effects, gripping suspense while never losing people with over-elaborate dialouge or indulging in techno-dweeb fascinations.  All this works to move an intricate plot, which in a nutshell is a being with superior intelligence named Khan (An inspired, gleefully maniacal Richard Montalban who gives the movies' best performance) who was imprisoned by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) years ago on a desolate, deserted planet.  Khan escapes seeking revenge on Kirk as well as getting his hands on the Genesis device, a machine that can basically turn lifeless matter in to something that can sustain life (imagine a moon and turning into a living planet).   Kirk runs across Khan while training a new crew for the Enterprise and their battle of wits and weaponry insues. Caught in the middle between Kirk and Khan is the team that created Genesis, which includes Kirk's son and former lover.  Meyer skillfully builds the movie to its unbearably suspenseful climax in which Khan and Kirk are hunting each other in a nebula, blinded by the forces within the nebula itself.<br />A skillful blend of action, suspense and tragedy, &quot;Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan&quot; is an amazing cinematic milestone.  Not only is it easily one of the best science-fiction films ever made, it deserves to be on the same bench as &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&quot;the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;
B000002U82|5.0|It's a good thing they came out with cd's, because I wore out 2 albums of DSOTM.  I've seldom experienced such depth and feeling in contemporary music.  I've heard Pink Floyd's style referred to as &quot;Hypno-Rock&quot; and that seems to be a pretty good interpretation.  I love the way the music flows from one song to the next, and David Gilmour's guitar work, fraught with emotion, almost brings tears to my eyes. My 14 year old daughter now asks me to put this cd on whenever we are in my car. A true masterpiece in every respect.
0375422307|4.0|PERSEPOLIS is what has come to be known as a &quot;graphic novel.&quot; In its purist form, a graphic novel is a story told through sequential art. A friend of mine, upon receiving a copy of THE ROAD TO PERDITION that I sent to him, called me and exclaimed in delight, &quot;I didn't know they had these things! It's like a comic book!&quot; And yes, it is. When it's well done, it's not as easy as it looks and not simply something for lazy readers. You must have an excellent writer, a sensitive illustrator, and empathy between them to make it work.<br />Marjane Satrapi demonstrates her writing and artistic skills in PERSEPOLIS, which tells the story of Satrapi's early childhood, with the main focus being on her life from age ten through fourteen, from 1980 through 1984. Those were particularly turbulent years for Satrapi's native country of Iran, encompassing the overthrow of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (the Shah of Iran), the installation of the Islamic Republic, and the war with Iraq. The story is told entirely through the eyes of Satrapi, the child, and how these events affected her parents, her relatives, her friends, and herself. In her introduction to PERSEPOLIS, Satrapi notes that writing this book was so important to her since her native country is associated with fundamentalism, fanaticism and terrorism; she does not want the entire nation judged, in her words, upon the actions of a few extremists. She additionally does not want the victims of these actions to be forgotten. In this, she succeeds: Satrapi's stark black and white images cast an appropriate and memorable gloom over her story.<br />PERSEPOLIS has been compared to MAUS, and certainly Satrapi's topic is somewhat similar, but her artistic style is closer to that of Los Bros Hernandez, whose brilliant LOVE AND ROCKETS is sadly missed. While Satrapi's artistic technique tends toward the spare, she wrings every possible emotion out of each drawing, communicating with a few strokes and shades what might otherwise take paragraphs, or even pages of words. When, for instance, she learns of the execution of her favorite uncle at the hands of the Islamic Republic, her reaction, her emotional devastation, is communicated ever so eloquently in a single, stark panel. It is almost anti-climactic when she rejects the personification of God afterward. Even the images of playtime and recreation --- those things that we here in the United States take for granted --- are subtlety infused with somber overtones.<br />PERSEPOLIS ends with Satrapi's parents sending her to Austria to avoid the repercussions of the Islamic government. One is left wondering what became of Satrapi and her parents. Satrapi is reportedly working on a sequel to PERSEPOLIS, which undoubtedly will be most welcomed by readers of this volume.<br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is by far the most brilliant piece of work I have ever laid my eyes on. The directing is great, the story is great, the characters are great, the acting is great, even the cover of the DVD gives me goosebumps. The people who write these reviews saying that this movie has no plot just don't understand it. The whole point of the movie is to show that this man, Charles Foster Kane, wasted his entire life by being selfish, greedy, and arrogant. And the whole \\"Rosebud\\" situation with his sled is to show that the only time this man was ever truly happy, was when he was a child with his sled. THE \\"ONLY\\" TIME HE WAS EVER TRULY HAPPY (Kind of makes you feel a little sorry for him). <br />Now I hope that all you people that didn't understand this movie learned something because this movie is truly a masterpiece that should be enjoyed by everyone. By the way, I'm only 13 years old and I understood the plot...just so you're aware.<br />Oh yes, and one more thing. To all those people that say that this movie is great, but since more movies are being made everyday, it shouldn't be called the greatest movie ever made. Well, one reason that it is considered the greatest movie ever made is because it is a great movie. But the other main reason is because Orson Welles invented a lot of cinema technigues that we still use in movies today (fading into a scene, closing in on something, etc.) That is why there will probably never be a movie as great as Citizen Kane, because it invented so many things for cinema that, obviously, could never be invented again.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Though not quite as memorable as Shore's music for the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; the music for the &quot;Two Towers&quot; is a fantastic piece of music, one that shows Shore's growth as a composer and his mastery to the leitmotif aproach to scoring.  He skillfully takes shines a dim light on Middle Earth's darkest corners, illuminating the journies of the scattered members of the Fellowship with some exotic instumentation, and employing a handful of otherworldly vocal talents such as Isabel Bayrakdarian, Sheila Chandra and Emiliana Torrini to help paint the worlds of men, Ents and the fearsome lands of Isengard and Mordor.  <br />The whole of the soundtrack is magnificent, but Shore outdoes himself with a slew of tracks as varied as they are inspired pieces of music.  &quot;The Evenstar&quot; is a disarmingly beautiful track, featuring the vocals of of Isabel Bayrakdarian and a mournful strings that have a heavy vibrato to create the mood of the song.  &quot;The White Rider&quot; paints the resurrected Gandalf in a glorious light with anthemic choral and brass passages and powerful strings.  &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; is another standout, being the anthesis to the soothing melodicism of Enya's May it Be.  Emiliana Torrini's Björkish voice is perfect for the songs' unsettling and dark mood.  Hell we are talking about the withered creature who keeps saying &quot;My Precious.&quot;  &quot;The Breath of Life,&quot; my favorite track, builds from a quiet beginning featuring the vocals of Sheila Chandra to a muscular mid-tempo section with heroic brass melodies and an urgency that makes you feel Aragorn's ride to warn Helm's Deep of Isengards' 10,000 strong army of Uruk-hai.  Like the movie, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; soundtrack ably carries the pivotal middle part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy with an epic scope but with an intimacy that drives it deeper to paint the world of Middle-Earth.
B0000844IT|5.0|Army of Darkness is one of the cheesiest movies of all time, but that way because it was supposed to be not because it lacks talented actors, writers or anything else. It's the highest budget movie of the Evil Dead serious and easily the cheesiest. The Boom stick edition is cool because it includes both the Directors cut and the US theatrical version, which are different in enough ways to be worthy of separate disks. I prefer the US Theatrical version, its not only the one a grew up with but its ending is cooler than the directors cut. This action/comedy/horror is a vital piece to anyone's DVD library.<br />Army Of Darkness is about Ash, the one liner spouting tough guy with a chainsaw for a hand. Ash is transported to medieval times, where a great evil has covered the land. All Ash really wants is a ride home, but these people need a savior and it seems as though he might just fit the bill. Groovy.
037542217X|5.0|Western writers usually enter Africa by way of a protagonist who belongs to their own culture (missionary, functionary, explorer, soldier, mail-order bride) and is venturing into unknown territory. So it is one of the mysteries --- and miracles --- of recent fiction that a Scotsman named Alexander McCall Smith should have created a character like Precious Ramotswe, the full-bodied, clear-headed, absolutely captivating investigator who inhabits all four of his Botswana novels: THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, and now, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.<br />Mma Ramotswe (in traditional Botswana culture, honorifics are always used; it seems rude not to do so in the review as well) has had a tough life: married to an abusive jazz musician, she loses her baby and then her beloved father. But she finds her vocation: she sets up the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and is soon attracting clients. She also acquires a fianc&eacute;, garage owner Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, two orphans, and a sidekick, Mma Makutsi, who received a grade of 97 percent on her exams at the Botswana Secretarial College. You don't have to be familiar with the first three books to follow the action in KALAHARI --- McCall Smith is careful to supply context for the first-time reader --- but I think it's better to discover them in order. Not only do you gradually develop a sense of Mma Ramotswe and her life on Zebra Drive (yep, that's the name of her street), but you also become deeply fond of Botswana (this is important since, to the average Westerner, Africa is still a \\"dark\\" --- that is, unknown --- continent). These wise, charming books leave you feeling washed clean and peaceful, with an expanded sense of humanity.<br />Although KALAHARI and the other books are technically mysteries, plot is not the main thing here. There are interlocking events --- a man across town opens a new detective agency; Mma Makutsi starts a typing school for men; Mma Ramotswe solves a case or two --- but there is little real tension or suspense. What keeps you reading is the wonderful writing: pure, economical, funny, utterly lacking in condescension. The evocation of Botswana is often lyrical (its quiet roads, its ubiquitous cattle). Sometimes the stories seem fable-like, as if McCall Smith is telling them around a campfire in the deep African night. This impression is reinforced by the repetition of certain phrases. Mma Ramotswe has a \\"tiny white van\\" and is \\"traditionally built.\\" She believes in \\"the old Botswana morality\\" --- a phrase that covers everything from knocking and calling out \\"Ko Ko\\" before you enter someone's house to the deeper sense of courtesy and integrity that is being overwhelmed by modern life.<br />It is one of the many ironies of this wonderful book that Mma Ramotswe and her cohorts, despite their professed yearning for traditional values, are actually the smartest, most progressive people around. Because they are authentic and honest and guided by common sense rather than greed or pride, they make phony modernists like the proprietor of the rival Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency look like idiots (the scene in which Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi pay him a visit is priceless). Indeed, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN, more than the others in the series, is very much occupied with gender; it has a feminist streak a mile wide.<br />Consider the characters McCall Smith gives us: the entrepreneurial Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi; the imposing head of the orphan farm, Mma Potokwani, who wangles free products and services from everyone (\\"It would take a degree of courage that few possessed to turn [her] down\\"); Mma Tsolamosese, whose daughter has died of AIDS and who is caring for her doomed grandchild with dignity and compassion; and Mma Boko, who is head of a local branch of the Botswana Rural Women's Association but refuses to run for office because \\"all [men] do is talk about money and roads and things like that. ... We women have more important things to talk about.\\"<br />With sly humor and wry tolerance, the novel captures that conspiratorial sense among women --- in any culture --- that men are not quite up to their standards (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni being the exception, of course): \\"The trouble with men,\\" muses Mma Ramotswe, \\"was that they went about with their eyes half closed for much of the time. ... That was why women were so good at tasks which required attention to the way people felt. Being a private detective, for example. ...\\" Or Mma Makutsi, commenting on the essays written by her typing-school students: \\"All of life seemed to be laid out before her: mothers, wives, football teams, ambitions at work, cherished motor cars; everything that men liked.\\" And when Mma Ramotswe says her foster son is going through \\"a difficult patch,\\" a friend replies dryly: \\"Boys do go through times like that. It can last for fifty years.\\"<br />McCall Smith, it turns out, was born in what is now Zimbabwe (then called Southern Rhodesia) and taught law at the University of Botswana, but those facts alone hardly explain his astounding ability to enter the soul of a woman as well as the soul of Africa. He, like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, must be one of the exceptions, a good man. He is certainly an imaginative and observant one. Somehow he manages to communicate the specific feel and spirit of Botswana while also creating characters that transcend the barriers of geography, culture, and gender.<br />McCall Smith is writing a fifth Precious Ramotswe book, according to his publisher, and has started a new series featuring another lady detective, Isabel Dalhousie (Scottish father, American mother).

0385509456|5.0|This remarkable novel starts with the murder of an older dog and ends with the naming of a puppy. In between it achieves a lot with extremely simple means. On the surface it poses as the coming-of-age story of the autistic teenager, Christopher. In the wake of a long and distinguished tradition, coming-of-age novels are encumbered by a time-honored set of conventions, which are rigidly observed here, with the marvelous effect of complementing the rigidity of the autistic boy's behavior. As a \\"red herring\\", to use Christopher's terminology, the novel starts as a mystery story, but this pretense is dropped midway when the mystery is solved by a confession, in precisely the way the many \\"clues\\" dropped along the way led the reader to believe it would be solved. But by then deep issues of style and substance have been raised and cast in an entirely novel light.<br />We are told that an autistic child is incapable of telling anything but the truth, even if not always the whole truth. Given that the story is told in the first person by Christopher, this has remarkable stylistic repercussions: the author is bound to foreswear the use of metaphor, though not of simile. This leads to an occasionally hilarious exploration of a literature without metaphors. Under this constraint, descriptions turn quantitative. A meadow is described by listing the numbers of cows with different hide markings, and in the interest of \\"truthful disclosure\\" we are told that the boy is observing the meadow while \\"weeing\\" during a car trip. You say \\"aha now I know how literature that is close to the truth, and as such much more reliable, would look like.\\" Add to this that an autistic child is incapable of understanding human emotions, another crucial ingredient of a good novel, and you are led to say \\"now I know what literature devoid of any understanding of emotions would look like.\\" <br />And then, when you are through with this novel, you suddenly realize that all its unassailable component truths add up to one big lie. For why should a human being haunted by fears and suffering, as overwhelming as those experienced by Christopher, care about understanding the emotions of those around him? Anyway why should these creatures, subject to the whole usual gamut of human emotions, from love to jealousy, from hatred to revenge, serve as a worthwhile example to him? His pain is much deeper than theirs and in final analysis what he experiences as physical pain of all kinds (in his chest, his head, wherever) is really a gamut of emotions compared to which all the petty emotions of those around him pale. So, accepting the basic premise of this book --- that Christopher understands nothing about human emotions --- is the biggest lie of all and we are back on the territory of novels in which bored capricious women, be it in a French small town or in Russian high society, are driven to adultery, and when despair sets in, to suicide. Cristopher's despair dwarfs that of Mmes. Karenina and Bovary, but he at least has figured out how to groan or take the cubes of integers and thereby to cope and survive.<br />Even what might be thought of at first as a weakness of this book, in the end turns out to be one of its strengths. I have in mind the rigid matter-of-fact style appropriate to Christopher's narration, which starts wearing on the reader after a while. My reaction was one of impatience, of I have seen that, can't you do something else. But then, this going on the reader's nerves is marvelously tailored to make him understand through first hand experience what living with an autistic child feels like, even if only for the short time it takes to read this novel. <br />Rather than simply assuring us that Christopher is intelligent and scientifically talented, the author has him elegantly rendering some beautiful and well-known ideas of mathematics and physics. It is clear that this boy is headed for a life in the sciences, but will his autism stand in the way of his doing original work? Creative work, as has been realized over the years, has an important emotive component. Will Christopher be able to come up with what it takes at the emotional level? To judge by what we know about him from this story, he does have all it takes, and if there is a danger it is that he even has too much of it.<br />Besides being a future scientist, Christopher is known to us as a writer who has us rethinking the description and understanding of emotions in literature and the meaning of truth, or at least of truth as reflected in a work of art.
B000084T18|5.0|Love it love it.  50 Cent has got good quality singing.  I wish I had this compact disk for Christmas time or my birthday.  totally rocking music -mellow and- slow and  fabulous/delicious.  bye,  flustered.
B00004XONN|5.0|Recent public votes suggest this is one of the top 50 albums of all time so we know who is right and who is wrong. <br />This ain't music that you will like immedietly. My first thoughts were \\"what the hell is this ****\\". Now it is one of my favourites. If you don't have the patience, I recommend a band with much simpler music like Linkin Park. This ain't stuff you'll be used to but some believe this is the best that Radiohead have done.<br />Personally, I disagree, but I can understand why some think that. It isn't as if Radiohead are a small band so that must say something about it.<br />People given this poor reviews either haven't listened to it enough or find it impermeable, preferring simpler music. That ain't a bad thing by the way. If you want a challenge, get this album. It is well worth the patience.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Before the movie came out I had heard a lot about Harry Potter, but didn't enter this entertaining universe until this movie had come out.  I got so much out of this movie and was impressed with its story and imagination tha I had all of the four books that were released at the time read within a month of seeing the movie.  One of the best movies I've seen in a VERY LONG TIME.<br />So, why 4 stars?  The 4 stars is for the movie itself.  The fifth star is for the DVD.  I was really excited for the DVD to come out so I could watch the special features.  After reading the book, I had wanted to see the scenes that hadn't made it into the movie.  I STILL haven't found it and just got tired of all the stupid games it wanted me to go through just to get to them.  Buy this DVD for the excellent movie and picture/sound quality.  Don't buy it for the special features.  I was left very disappointed by them.  If you don't care for the digital picture and sound, get it on VHS.
1563894696|4.0|This was a very fun read.  I like the writing of this book and the tension between the Gordon/Dent/Batman group and the uneasy relations between Bats and Catwoman.  I thought the book moved well throughout and I liked the ending (which a few people were let down by).  Loeb's writing goes through many plot turns and shows a good amount of imagination.  Tim Sale's artwork may not be for everybody but I enjoyed.  While this may not be the best Batman collection ever.  I think it should definetly be in the Top 10.  Do yourself a favor and read this.  This is good stuff.
B00005N83M|5.0|Hi.  I love Jennifer Lopez singing.  it is delicious singing.  bye,  flustered.
B00005B4GU|3.0|After Kid A, which is a very detailed and clever album, people expect the songs on this one to grow on them, even if they do not sound right the first few times. Indeed the music is original and clever. However it is hardly likeable. It seems that having the guts to make such unexplored music is one thing, but actually being able to make it good music is another thing entirely.<br />Take 'Like Spinning Plates' for example. The first time you listen to it it sounds terrible. You'd expect this album, like Kid A with say 'Everything In Its Right Place', to eventually grow on you. However, instead it just turns out to be a fractured and a very average song. This is the same as 'Hunting Bears' and 'Life in a glasshouse', leaving people nodding at the end \\"hmmm.... wasn't that clever\\". However, is there any point in it being clever if it doesn't sound that good? Kid A accomplished this problem and is what makes better.<br />Despite such flaws, there are some very good tracks on this album. 'Pyramid Song' is one of my favourites from Radiohead and lives here. 'I Might Be Wrong' and 'Knives Out' (thats all three singles) are also good catchy tracks with some experimentation invoved. 'Pacht Like Sardines...', the opening track is additionally original and yet impressive.<br />However, now I am starting to struggle a little again. 'Pulk Revolving Doors' is saved and respected for its creepy words that suit the dodgy sound effects. 'You and Whose Army' is also fairly likeable, but bloody miserable and gets old after a while.<br />The rest are poor. The remake of 'Moring Bell' is absolutely terrible and this originality is only original because its rubbish and no one else would want to do it. It, itself brings the album down, especially when there's a much better listening of it on Kid A. Furthermore, 'Dollars and Cents' is a useless load of noise with really cringable cheesy vocals. However, I think it is fair to disagree here as I did at first like this song. But now it has become one of the worst.<br />So here you have it. The most difficult album they've done because half of it never becomes likeable even when you do begin to appreciate it. However, despite my criticism it is still pretty good, just poor compared to the three albums prior to this.
B00008G9JN|1.0|You know, it seems to me *everyone* who has posted here *likes*  &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;-at least as it first appeared, without the come-on tracks and re-processing. *I* like &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;--as it first appeared. I recommend you *buy* &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;--as it first appeared (easier to do than you might think). Just don't get the idea that it's wonderful or even substantial; you'll only be disappointed (unless you can manage to work yourself into some kind of fatuous fanatic frenzy-&quot;fan&quot; is short for &quot;fanatic&quot;). No, it's fluff, cotton-candy, and somewhat flawed at that, over all nice, nevertheless. <br />I *also* like &quot;Velvet Green&quot;'s lyric (as well as &quot;Pibroch&quot;'s and &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;'s, though I've never been able to make out all of &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;'s--the arrangement masks it), just not so much I want to hear the whole thing twice every time I play this record. Its vocal line (or &quot;melody&quot;, if you prefer) is repetitious, but that's okay. I *don't* care for its instrumental section, or most of the instrumental sections on the album, though. The second half of &quot;Pibroch&quot;'s isn't bad, however: Ian Anderson's breathy hornpipe is amusing and David Palmer's more (than in the first half) contrapuntal manipulation of the five-note motive he borrowed (to put it charitably) from Bach (B minor two-part invention and C minor fugue from the first book of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;) is palatable, but I'd prefer David Palmer use real strings instead of ersatz canned string Cheese-Whiz.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a story about Chihiro, who at first seem to be a lazy and spoiled 10-year-old girl. But when faced with life or death, she found tremendous strength within herself. Along her path to save her friend's life and her parents' redemption, she was able to befriend everyone and every spirit. She does it so easily because she has a generous heart, and nonjudgmental mind of a child. <br />Hayao Miyazaki takes you into a magical world full of animal spirits, gods, and demons. Miyazaki's unique culture perceptive fills the pages of Spirited Away with visual delights and humor. Spirited Away is a story of love, friendship, and inner strength. I highly recommend this fantastic movie for the whole family.
B00000AFFF|3.0|The inadequacies of Elvis Costello's singing point up the sweep and emotional range of Burt Bacharach's music, but the inadequacies of Elvis Costello's lyric-writing damage much of it irreparably. His lyrics often don't scan or rhyme true or make any coherent point (and let's not even mention the awful puns). Even when they scan they only seem to fit emotionally about one half of the time. In short, Mr. Costello painfully lacks the discipline and technical adroitness of Hal David. (Hal David himself is no match for Dorothy Fields or Oscar Hammerstein, certainly not for Stephen Sondheim.) At least I expected Mr. Costello to help rein in Mr. Bacharach's penchant for shlocky over-orchestration: a little austerity goes a long way. The best song I think is &quot;Tears at the Birthday Party&quot;. The problem is that the story it tells hinges on it worst line: &quot;Some day I know he'll forget to pay you the compliments you're after.&quot; The musical setting makes it sound as if the phrase &quot;to pay you the compliments you're after&quot; is not the object of &quot;forget&quot;, that it belongs with the following sentence. In any case, the sentiment expressed is misogynistic and puerile.
B000002HMH|5.0|So whats this(black was the last good metallica album?) This is my personal favorite of metallica album of all time period. I love bleeding me, and hero of the day they are probably the best ones one the album. King nothing(where's your crown?) is great too! Get this one you will not regret!
0393057658|5.0|This is a very interesting book that will probably come across as more impressive than it should to casual baseball fans.  For those who have been reading, enjoying, and agreeing with Bill James for years, it will largely be old hat.  Basically, the book is about baseball professionals finally taking seriously many of the ideas and concepts that Bill James has been articulating the past quarter century.<br />To Lewis's credit, he is quite up front about the central role that James plays in this book.  Lewis even treats James as something of a genius, both as a baseball theoretician and a prose writer (James is an absolutely riveting writer; anyone doubting this should purchase immediately his THE NEW BILL JAMES HISTORICAL BASEBALL ABSTRACT).  What I find a bit more curious is Michael Lewis's obsession with Billy Beane.  No question, Billy Beane is a great general manager, and there is equally no question that the Oakland A's are a team driven by the front office.  The problem is--and in fact Lewis's book hints at this fact, though he only hints--that the A's are a great organization.  What makes the A's great is not Billy Beane, as good as he is, but the whole group of first rate personnel comprising the Oakland front office.  Most of those people were not hired by Billy Beane.  The overwhelming focus of this book on Billy Beane is more than a little surreal.<br />Although I think this is a great book, I also think that Michael Lewis chose the wrong subject.  The really interesting story here is NOT how Billy Beane has managed to build a winning team on so little money, but rather the impact that a complete reconceptualization of what contributes to winning baseball games could have on the game of baseball.  In that regard, Billy Beane is only a part of the story, and the issues surrounding the Oakland A's budget a bit irrelevant.  If the Bill James's-inspired theories are correct, the size of a team's budget is fairly irrelevant.  If the New York Yankees changed their playing philosophy, they could still use their money to buy the players with the highest on base percentage and the pitchers with the highest strike outs to walks ratios and who give up few home runs.  Budget really is quite irrelevant to all the central points of the book. And to test out the theories about how to win a baseball game requires more test cases than merely the Oakland A's.  Myself, I do believe the theories are sound.  The 2003 Toronto team has built its team around many of the same ideas.  All their hitters work pitchers deep into the count, take a lot of walks, have solid on base percentages, and have some power.  The Boston Red Sox seem to be trying out some of these ideas.  Personally, I think focusing on the Oakland A's is a misleading error.<br />The confusion at the heart of Lewis's book is confusing a strategic approach to baseball with the entirely separate issue of Oakland's tight budget.  The latter merely masks the more important story.  Moreover, budgetary concerns are highly contingent.  If all the teams in baseball were to adopt a team policy of building their teams around players with some power who had high on base percentages, this will in turn effect the pricing of players.  It is a mere coincidence right now that some of the players Beane's regards highly are not desired by others.  Besides, even Beane acknowledges the greatness of players like Giambi and Bonds.<br />Nonetheless, for those unfamiliar with these alternative ways of valuing ballplayers, this is a great introduction.  Just take all the Billy Beane obsessiveness with a container of salt.  And remember that it is just an accident that money is a factor in this story at all.  That will change as soon as the rest of baseball changes its thinking about the nature of the game.their playing philosophy, they could still use their money to buy the players with the highest on base percentage and the pitchers with the highest strike outs to walks ratios and who give up few home runs.

B00000JY1X|5.0|Whatever your perspective on love, whatever your current romantic status, you'll find it mirrored in this amazing collection of songs. Whatever your preference for genre-- honky-tonk country, French cabaret, Broadway, punk rock, blues-- you'll hear it here. And Stephen Merritt writes the sort of dazzlingly witty lyrics and catchy tunes that aren't supposed to exist anymore-- the cheery &quot;The Ugliest Guy On The Lower East Side&quot; is my personal favorite.<br />These are unquestionable, must-own albums.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|The complexity of General George S. Patton, Jr. is mind-boggling.  A relentless student of war.  A fierce competitor, strategist, and antagonist.  Arrogant, ruthless, and egomaniacal.  A deep, unwavering love and commitment for the men under his command.  Brash and abrasive, he was politically incorrect before anyone knew what political correctness was.<br />Director Franklin J. Schaffner depicts all of this complexity (and more) in his epic masterpiece, PATTON.  And George C. Scott delivers the title role brilliantly, a role that defined this distinguished actor's career.<br />PATTON is not propaganda:  it is a compelling look at a larger-than-life American hero, warts and all.  Brilliant as Patton was, he tended to be his own worst enemy, from slapping a soldier he accused of cowardice to jeopardizing his battalion through barren Sicily because he wanted to arrive in Messina ahead of Field Marshal Montgomery's forces.  Patton knew the enemy well, knew how to defeat it--he simply could not deal with the bureacracy of the Allied command, to his detriment.  Demoted, muzzled, he was kicked to the sidelines of World War II until General Eisenhower called him back into battle during the late stages of the conflict.  Upon returning, Patton (\\"Old Blood 'n Guts\\") performed masterfully, enhancing his icon status.<br />As the war concludes, the viewer is drawn into Patton's passion to continue marching east, into Russia.  What would have happened had the British and Americans followed Patton's advice and defeated a rundown and tired Russian army?  A Cold War averted, or a cataclysmic nuclear nightmare?  The viewer can only wonder.<br />Karl Malden as humble and modest General Omar N. Bradley--the antithesis of Patton--is equally brilliant; Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is haunting yet superb.  PATTON is the epitome of exceptional filmmaking, an exceptional movie about an exceptional man.<br />--D. Mikels
B000002H70|5.0|I confess, I was once a fully paid up 'fan' of The Cure and bought every one of their records: I was a teenage boy, and the confused, dark, angst-ridden world of Robert Smith rang true to me in my turbid teens. A few years ago I grew up and gave away all my records, but this one remains as the one I would still salvage from a burning house - if I had only kept it! As a purist, I first loathed the record, believing it to be something of a sell-out. I was wrong. As another reviewer says; once listened to a few times, it sinks in, warms up, gets hold, and never lets go.<br />Disintegration is sometimes bleak and dark, always compelling, driving and powerful; lyrically weaving, rhythmic and clever. But be careful: If you are a boy who has just lost his girlfriend and you listen to this record whilst drunk, in a darkened room, with the volume turned up to eleven, you could well end up smashing up your house: It is that kind of record.<br />In turns it is warm and gentle, deep and majestic, loving, bewildered, tense, beautiful, bereft, plucky, energising, and stirring.<br />If you buy this CD, I only ask you to remember that you may need to listen to it through a few times before you finally 'get it'; this is a record you cannot get the most out of until you more fully understand and connect with the songs, and make them yours. If this appeals to you then buy this record, because, speaking a purist, Disintegration is one of the best records and certainly the most complete collection of songs The Cure have ever made.
0440236738|4.0|This was the first book I've read by Coben, but not the last.  So many surprises, I could not put down! What a wonderful author.  I want to read everything he's written.
B000069AUI|5.0|their music just gets better and better...Rush of Blood is grittier and offers more than their last album which was mostly ballads...if you liked their first then you'll definitely dig this one...i did and also think that best song is Warning Sign..dam good..the amount of money i paid for this was definitely worth it...
B000099T2L|4.0|I bought this album on the first day..and i wasn't a big fan of Beyonce..although i love mainly the original Destiny's Child music..but anyways i was impressed by the album and I'll give the girl props. The best songs to me are Signs&quot; and &quot;Be With You&quot;. I think this album is an album that has to grow on people..it has mostly slow songs..and i'm a ballad person..but i also like the fact that Beyonce didn't oversing on the album and her vocals are stronger to me.<BR>I like her more as a vocalist on this album and i think her album is the best out of the group. Although i think that she could have left some of the uptempos off the cd..such : &quot;Yes&quot;,&quot;That's How U Like It&quot;, and &quot;Hip-Hop Star (although this one is growing on me), and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;<BR> but in the end I felt i got my money's worth.
B000099T2L|5.0|I think this the best album solo or groups by destiny's child. I like kelly, and michele, and soloange(which might be a dc group member). But there is something about this album that make this very special. The best songs on the album is naughty girl. but it all good to listen to  you can't skip a song on that cd. Youy have to let that cd play all the way through. well fro me anyway i'm adc memebr 4 life
B000002E5J|5.0|This is probably the best album by Shakira. It sounds fresh and fine. I think she is first of all Spanish singing star. Note, that it is her mother tongue! English songs are also good but not so naturally simple and moving. If this album had only two songs: &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; and &quot;Pies Descalzos Suenos Blancos&quot;, it would be already worth to buy and enjoy listening over and over again...
B00008J4P5|5.0|The fourth c.d. by the Detroit based duo is their best yet, in my mind. Every song on this c.d. is worth giving a listen to, and will never bore you. I reallly enjoy listening to the entire c.d., but I will give you a list of my top five favorite tracks. The first is the first single, Seven Nation Army, a witty song with an amazing bass line that takes aim at many critics who believe The White Stripes aren't complete without a bassist. My next favorite is There's No Home For You Here, a fun and upbeat track with very good lyrics that compliment each other nicely. Next in the list is In The Cold, Cold Night, in which Meg White sings, in a very soft, mild tone which displays her amazing vocals. Another favorite of mine is The Hardest Button To Button, a neat song which showcases Jack and Meg's talent even further. Last, but certainly not least is Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine. Another great upbeat track with ferocious vocals, and an amazing guitar riff. All in all you get way more than you deserve with this c.d., and people who give this c.d. less than three stars, have no taste in good, classic music, that is made from the heart. Many have taken aim at the band recently becasue they are scared. Scared that good, amazing music is coming back that will wipe this pop rock out for good. Jack and Meg, keep it comming you are an amazing band, and certainly my favorite, with good reason. Oh yeah if any managment happens to stummble upon this, could you please plan a concert somewhere in Oregon, I know many people are anxious to see this great band preform live.
B00005RYLE|5.0|If you like zombies, monsters, or anything else that will scare people, \\"The Evil Dead\\" has it. This movie is one of my personal favorite movies of all-time. This movie was followed by two sequels and two video games (get a fistful of boomstick). The gore factor is very high (the only way to kill the \\"deadites\\" is two chop them up) and there is a lot of suspense. There is even a scene where a woman is raped by a tree! I highly recomend this movie if you are a die-hard horror fan.
0066214122|5.0|I think this is one of the best Crichton's books yet. The plot is very entertaining and original. The action is non-stop, and the writing is good. I couldn't stop reading the book once I started. I am extemely surprised some reviewers found the book slow. Possibly they lack some technical skills necessary to understand what is going on. The book does get a little technical at times, almost a la Heinlein in some his books. But it made only more interesting to me. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone.
B00005JLYU|3.0|Action packed, colorful cinematography, excellent CGI, but weak storyline; and you see all the ugly parts of the 3 Angels - like a overweight Drew Barrymore, a pimples-all-over-the face Lucy Liu, and a bony Cameron Diaz.  Good try for Demi Moore - physically fit, but your makeup is overdone.  Respect your courage though.  Remember, make-up can't hide your age!<br />Getting bored to see this stop-the-frame, bullet-POV type of CGI as seen in Matrix and many other Hollywood movies these days(kind of a fusion with the Hong Kong action movie technique).  Something new next time, please.<br />This is a very technically made movie by Director McG by using a lot of modern day CGI technology.  But a good movie is more than just technology.<br />I am giving an overall rating of B.
B000002ADT|5.0|I haven't actually purchased or listened through the entire album just yet.  A friend of mine let me take a gander at his copy of the album so I could see if I would like to purchase my own.  I have not gotten past of the first track, &quot;So What&quot;.  That song is a great piece of work.  I keep listening to that track over and over.  I love it.  I'm sure I will love the rest of the album once I get to it.  I will definately purchase this album.  I would highly reccommend this to anyone.
B00006BTCA|1.0|A friend of mine said 'Listen to this album'.So I did and didn't realise that Kitchens Of Distinction were still going !! In anger I leant him all of KOD's back catalogue and he was left speachless by that group's brilliance . Interpol ? An incredibly poor man's KOD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am really surprised by some of the negative reviews here for this album. Apparently &quot;Ok Computer&quot; is not for everyone. But if you are here, reading these reviews, contemplating whether or not to pick this up CD, please do so. Immediately. I have loved this album since I bought way back when it came out. I get so much out of this album that I thank Radiohead regularly in my thoughts, just to keep my karma in check.
B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane has an almost overwhelming amount of great albums. 'A Love Supreme', 'Blue Train', 'My Favorite Things' and 'Giant Steps' are just three of his MANY discs that any modern jazz musician would consider their milestone. Of all his albums, 'Giant Steps' is the best one of the records that focused on short, concise songs dominated by blues-and-bebop tenor sax. Not an epic like his later years, it's more of a blueprint for future quarter bop.<BR>     The best thing about this disc is that almost every song begins and ends with a really cool head. The head of each tune sets the mood for the song, and is very catchy. <BR>     The opening title track's majestic, dreamy head and chord progressions make it one of the best standards of 50's jazz. The soloing is out there, and the instantly recogizable head sounds good on any instrument from electric guitar to steel pans. &quot;Cousin Mary&quot; is a very similar track: cool head, great solo by John, great piano solo, outro head. Very nifty. &quot;Countdown&quot;, the only non-structured head-dominated tune, is an improvised solo fest that blows away most of Coltrane's freeform contemporaries. &quot;Spiral&quot; has a very fitting name: the head bounces around in a way that points forward to rock musicians. <BR>     Although the first side is perfect, the second side is pretty good too. &quot;Naima&quot; and &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot; are two ballads that need to be appreciated in tandem. Both are very fine. The album closes with the disc's 'heaviest' tune, &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot;. A combo of burning bebop and soulful I-IV-V blues, it translates very well to other forms of music. When I play live with my progressinve rock/fusion band, we always &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot;, substituting an elctric guitar for the sax.<BR>     Nothing more to say. If you like jazz, buy this album. If you don't like jazz, this album just might change your mind.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Listen to everyone here. Stripped is beyond words. It's such a GREAT album I can't even express how much I love it. It's so much better than the first CD it can't even compare. This album truly sets her apart from those other blondes like Britney. You can't compare any of them to Christina and this album will show you that she is going to last as an artist and should be taken seriously. I hope that she gets a Grammy for this album because it's truly deserved. <BR>Some songs that stand out for me:<br />Can't Hold us Down - It's about female empowerment. It has an edgy beat and Lil Kim's rap gives the song that extra kick.<br />Loving Me 4 Me - What can I say the song almost made me cry because I could relate to it. The lyrics are beautiful!<br />Impossible - Another song I can relate to. It's produced by Alicia Keys another great artist so need I say more?<br />Make Over - LOVE IT! I don't care for rock music that much but this song has a rock edge to it and I love it. It's got that balance of pop and rock.<br />Cruz - At first I didn't care for this song but now I really love it because it's perfect for someone that's going into the \\"real world\\" or going through a break up. <br />Get Mine, Get Yours - A song about casual sex but done in such a way that shows a sexy song doesn't have to sound so over the top and scandalous.<br />I love every single song on this album and I could go on forever about each one, but I won't. Trust me the money you invest on this album won't go to waste and she might just surprise you! :)
B000099T2L|5.0|With her first illustrious solo effort, Dangerously In Love, Beyonce Knowles offers up a celestial melange of predominant midtempo grooves, whacked-out uptempo bangers, and a few lush ballads that add a sense of completeness to a most stellar set. The album's most distinct traits are its quality uptempos, which blend elements of the 70s and 80s with a contemporary urban sass all Beyonce's own. Baby Boy is an infectious reggae-tinged confection with man of the moment Sean Paul that is sure to set ablaze dance floors worldwide. <br />This set is replete with gorgeous midtempos and ballads to soothe to the same capacity as the exuberant uptempos excite. The summery \\"Yes\\" is a perfect blend of a catchy hook that relies on lyrics that are easy to relate to. On \\"Speechless\\", Knowles declares boldy her sexual side without undue reserve or affectation, delighting listeners with a blend of magnificently rangy, soft vocals and an astounding hook. The album is punctuated by a concluding endearing hidden track called \\"Daddy\\", dedicated to her industrious father Matthew Knowles.
B000084T18|5.0|THIS CD IS OFF THE ...CHAIN! BUY IT! I LIKE EVERY SINGLE SONG BUT THE BEST ONE'S ARE #3 (PATIENTLY WAITING W/ EMINEM) & #15 (DON'T PUSH ME W/ LLOYD BANKS & EMINEM) CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUM!
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is music at its' greatest! After absolutely loving &quot;Parachutes&quot;, I excitedly bought this album the week it came out expecting their formula of great writing, emotional vocals, and flawless production to shine through once more. After listening to it over and over again, I was certain that this album would remain in my favorites for a long time to come. It's better than I even began to imagine it would be. Beautiful work from an incredibly talented band! Can't wait for the next album!<br />Standout tracks:<BR>Politik<BR>Amsterdam<BR>Clocks<BR>The Scientist<BR>In My Place<br />Actually, every song on the album is great. But those stuck in my mind. :)
B00006RIO7|5.0|With \\"Chicago\\", the musical firmly returns to mainstream cinema! And I say, It's about time. Sure, we had \\"Moulin Rouge\\", which was an awesome movie too....but it used recent hits in a period piece...and didn't really create it's own music for the picture (with the exception of \\"Come What May\\"...and even that was written for a different movie originally).<br />\\"Chicago\\", based on the broadway play, has tons of great songs including the sexy \\"Cell Block Tango\\", the suggestive \\"When you're good to Mama\\", and the hilarious \\"Press Conference Rag (We Both Reached for the Gun)\\". Also included is a song not used in the film, \\"Class\\", with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah. Queen Latifah also contributes to a Pop Version of the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" that also features Lil' Kim and Macy Gray.
B000099T2L|3.0|It's not a bad album by any stretch, but I expected more from  Beyonc. She's written great songs while with Destiny's Child, but her writing on this album seems incredibly repetitive and too simplistic. It is, however, a fun album with a good &quot;Love&quot; theme, I suppose. <BR>Her voice is, as always, superb! But the songs are too simple for my taste.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|One of my favorite films has always been Steven Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, his gentle fable about the unlikely friendship between a boy and a funny-looking botanist from another planet...maybe from another galaxy.<br />Working from a screenplay by Melissa Mathison (from a story penned by the director), Spielberg tells a very personal tale about the effects of divorce on children (a theme he explores later in 2002's Catch Me If You Can) and adds a wonderful science-fiction twist.<br />We all know the story by heart: an alien botanist is stranded on Earth when his ship has to flee from government agents led by \\"Keys\\" (Peter Coyote).  Frightened and alone, the alien is discovered hiding in an L.A. home's tool shed by Elliott (Henry Thomas), a smart 9 year old who is having a hard time coping with his parents' recent divorce.  Elliott, his brother Mike (Robert McNaughton) and sister Gertie (a pre-Charlie's Angel Drew Barrymore) befriend the strange being they'll eventually name E.T. and will help him \\"phone home.\\"<br />Audiences the world over were won over by this simple yet touching film, and by the end of its theatrical run it had become the biggest box office hit of its time, surpassing Star Wars, the previous top-grosser.  With its mix of comedy, suspense, and Walt Disney-like fantasy, E.T. received both popular and critical acclaim, including several Academy Award nominations, including Best Score for John Williams' wonderful music, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.  Although E.T. won the best score and original screenplay awards, Sir Richard Attenborough's drama about India's most famous leader beat out Spielberg and E.T. in the latter categories.<br />Last year, Amblin Entertainment and MCA/Universal released a 20th Anniversary Edition of E.T. in theaters. With its soundtrack digitally remastered and some scenes tweaked with computer graphic imaging, a new generation of viewers saw this family classic on the big screen.  And in November of 2002, E.T. finally was released on the DVD format.<br />The DVD 2-disc set includes both versions of the film, a rare event for DVD releases.  Universal had originally planned to release the 2002 version separately and to sell the 1982 version in a more expensive boxed set.  Spielberg heard of this and vetoed the plan, thereby allowing everyone to own both versions of his most personal film at a reasonable price.<br />This is a must-get DVD for Spielberg fans...and for children of all ages.d in November of 2002, E.T. finally was released on the DVD format.<br />The DVD 2-disc set includes both versions of the film, a rare event for DVD releases.

B000050IE6|5.0|This cd is simply amazing. I love the combination of death metal vocals and blazing metal guitar riffs with the beautiful clean and acoustic parts to the songs. I highly recommend this cd to anyone, especially to listeners of metal and rock music. Even if you're not into metal give it a try. When i first listened to opeth i wasn't a fan of death metal vocals, but after i heard the song \\"The Moor\\" i was hooked. There isn't a bad song on this cd, if i could've given it more than 5 stars i would.
B000084T18|1.0|At first i thought this was a really good CD, but it ended up sounding just way too commercial. Yes, even almost Eminem commercial.  The main talent  this guy has is getting his name out and he certainly did it. But does that mean he'll top Biggie or 2pac? Nope. Just more commercial crud for the masses who sadly are buying this. Please buy something from Biggie Smalls or 2pac instead, AKA classic non-commercial rap.
0385504209|5.0|Besides going deep into the history of Mary Magdalene and her relationship with Jesus Christ, Dan Brown uncovers the mysterious and secret, religious Catholic sect: Opus Dei. I had often heard similar rumors about their bizarre religous beliefs and this book confirms many of them.  The DaVinci Code is carefully researched and the author has taken the time to include specific facts and details, which makes it all the more fascinating, e.g. the history of the tarot cards and astrology. I learned so much while being fully entertained. This was my first book that I've read by this author and I plan to read his other books as soon as possible. The mathematical &amp; word puzzles are a delight. Women of all ages will adore this book because the author confirms what we have known all along:  women are sacred. Bravo!
B00006690G|1.0|I totally digged Em's first album but sadly he became too commercial after the out-of-nowhere success of \\"The Slim Shady LP.\\"  Tracks such as \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" show his limitations as they just repeat other works that are far better (ie: \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"Forget About Dre.\\") If you want a tight, non-commercial album get \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" AKA his debut. THAT was a tight disc. Sorry but this deserves no stars.
B00006J3WH|5.0|===&gt;&quot;A musical Buffy episode?  THAT'll be a disaster,&quot; I thought, upon first seeing the TV listing for the episode &quot;Once More With Feeling.&quot;  I deliberately avoided watching it during its first run, and didn't encounter it again until I was taping reruns more than a year and a half later.  I went ahead and watched it all the way through, then went about my daily business.  By that afternoon, I was going crazy trying to stop singing half-remembered lines and melodies.  After watching the tape twice more, I resigned myself to the fact that I was going to have to purchase the soundtrack if I ever wanted to regain my sanity.<BR>===&gt;In a nutshell?  If you've never seen the episode, aren't a fan of BtVS, and don't mind shelling out eighteen bucks, give the CD a chance.  (As Anya would say, &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; and &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; could be breakaway pop hits.)  If you're a Buffyphile, purchase and memorize it.  Otherwise, you too might find yourself walking down the street singing, &quot;hm hm hm...under your spell...hm hm sea...hm hm hm hm Willow tree...hm hm hm....&quot;
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah came on to the scene in 1990 with a great debut album, which would be a blueprint of future works to come. (in terms of patterns of songwriting).  She has always evolved in the changing times of music. As in 1990 her music sounded very early 90's with &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; and &quot;Emotions.&quot;  In 1997 she recorded this magnificent work of art &quot;Butterfly&quot; which is no doubt her best work and doesn't sound outdated.  It is the perfect mix of Hip-Hop/R&amp;B infused beats courtesy of Corey Roony (&quot;Babydoll&quot;, &quot;BreakDown&quot;), Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs (&quot;Honey&quot;) and Trackmasters (&quot;The Rooftop&quot;) and adult contemporary courtesy of Longtime partner Walter Afansieff (&quot;Whenever You Call&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;My All&quot;, &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;).  The &quot;Daydream&quot; album was great musically but lyrically it left something to be desired.  She's improved so much since &quot;Daydream.&quot;  My overall favorite song is the breathtaking and moving &quot;Outside&quot; which shows so much emotion.    Another highlight is the remake of a Prince hit &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; featuring Sisqo of Dru Hill. Whether it's the poetic lyrics of &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; or the heartbreaking tale of &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot; is by far her best and most consistant and personal album to date... telling a tale of loss and sorrow. I first got this album around 1998 and only listened to the radio hits. But since I've listened to the whole CD and it's all GREAT. If you're looking for an album to listen to all the way through without skipping a track, &quot;Butterfly&quot; is for you.
B0000028M7|5.0|\\"Dirt\\" is not only seminal AIC, it's a seminal rock album, period.<br />That doesn't mean every song is great.  There are a few I don't care for, myself; I'm not much for \\"Sickman,\\" I might be one of the few people who don't like \\"Rooster\\" all that much (think it's been too heavily overplayed), and although I think \\"Junkhead\\" was important for Layne Staley to write and might have helped a few people get off drugs, I'd really rather not listen to it.<br />That being said, I think the song \\"Dirt\\" is fabulous.  Staley was very upset; he was not only talking about drug addiction (which most people get), but the depression that led him to it, in his lyric \\"I have never felt such frustration, such loss of self control.\\"  You'd better believe he meant it, but . . . why would he have started on drugs if he wasn't depressed in the first place?<br />The stuff goes hand-in-glove, really.  So, \\"Dirt\\" works to explain depression as well as drugs, and is one of the best songs I've ever heard explaining either.  This is why it was the title song of the collection.<br />\\"Rain When I Die\\" is another very subversive AIC song.  Not only does it encapsulate depression just as well as the more famous \\"Down in a Hole,\\" it has a very sarcastic undertone (as most of the best AIC songs did).  Granted, the long instrumental getting into this, then adding wordless vocals may turn some folks off; it didn't turn me off, though, because of what they were talking about.  Not only is Staley talking about how relationships rarely work, but he's talking about how easy it is to miscommunicate.  He boasts about how he won't back down in the next argument, then says ironically, \\"Then she calls my name, name . . . I think it's going to rain when I die.\\"  This is irony, folks; he's basically saying all his good thoughts about how he's going to prevail in the next argument go for naught -- and considering many people think this until they make up, it's an accurate assessment as far as it goes.  The last bit about \\"I think it's going to rain when I die\\" is Staley's way of saying it really doesn't matter to the rest of the world, but it matters to him, and he really wishes he could stick to his guns.  It's a very fun way to do it, and mostly overlooked.<br />The haunting, oriental-feel intro to \\"Dirt\\" gets to me every single time, btw.  Staley, Cantrell, and the other folks found a great way to lead into this song; heroin is a derivative of morphine, which is a derivative of opium (more or less) -- which is why the oriental-feel works so well.<br />Plus Staley's haunting chorus, \\"One who doesn't care, is one who shouldn't be, I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me\\" has to be one of the stronger statements anywhere about how his relationships haven't worked since he became depressed and/or started drugs (it's an either/or thing, or chicken and egg thing).  It's easy to see how Staley wishes he could do better, but just can't; still, he holds out implicit hope, because he keeps on trying (this, too, is another point overlooked).  He hopes for better, and reminds himself of what he has to stay away from in order to be less depressed and hopefully get off and stay off the drugs.<br />The fact that Staley himself could not stay away from drugs and died of a (most likely) accidental overdose is irrelevant; at the time this was recorded in 1992, Staley had no way to know he'd be dead at the young age of 34.  He was making a very powerful statement, saying, \\"Don't do this,\\" and couldn't have done a better job of it.  The other members of AIC, including Cantrell, added musicality to the depth of emotional expression Staley felt.<br />There are many other wonderful songs here, but those are the two I feel are most often overlooked.<br />Highly recommended.  Five stars plus.<br />And once again: Rest in peace, Layne Staley.  Though you didn't know it, your life _was_ worth it.
0593050789|4.0|This is a great book for many reasons.  First, it is a great adventure story.  The author takes the reader along the voyages of China's great treasure fleets in the 1420s as they sailed around the world.  Second, it clearly illustrates how history depends on who is around to tell it, and not on the truth.  Third, it is a great detective story.  The author shows how different clues have to be pieced together to create a coherent story.  And last, it is a perfect example of how achievements are easily forgotten or erased from memory.  The flow of the text is good; there are enough references in the text to keep it honest, but not so much as to break up the reading.  <br />The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that there should be more pictures and diagrams explaining the various sailing and navigation terms; like how latitude is measured via stars, how a ship sails into the wind, how distance is measured on a sailing vessel, etc...
B00005JA2B|5.0|No matter where I am at when I hear this album, it still brings back fantastic memories of my teenage years in the 70's. While all my buddies were listening to Boston's debut album which was released right around the same time, I was listening to this album which I always felt was a notch better. It was one of the first &quot;rock-n-roll&quot; albums I purchased. In fact, I first owned it on 8-Track, replaced that wonderful 8-Track technology with an LP and eventually graduated to a CD. I also recorded it onto a cassette so I could listen to it in my car. From the opening of &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; to the ending of &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;, there is not one bad track on this album. Even after 27 years, I still play this album at very loud volumes.<br />Although Kansas as well as Styx, Journey, Boston and Foreigner and many other bands have long been citicized for starting the &quot;corporate rock&quot; style (aren't you tired of hearing that term), I will rate this album as one of my top 10 favorites.
B00005OWIU|3.0|I am not a huge fan of Harry Potter, but I admit is a good, enjoyable film. And it's soundtrack is also as good, John Williams always comes forward with great scores, and even thought it has lots of copied themes from Hook and Star Wars, it still works. But Stitch from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is way off if he thinks this was the best soundtrack of 2001, because althought the score is quite good, it can never match the epic strenght and power of Howard Shore's The Lord of the Rings which did win the Oscar. Not only The Lord of the Rings story is far superior than the Harry Potter story, but the score of Lord of the Rings is also much more superior than the one of Harry Potter, and not just because the Lord of the Rings was a fresh and new score. None of the themes in Harry Potter even come close to any of the themes found in Lord of the Rings, every little tune in Potter is beaten by the Isengard March, or the Fellowship theme, or the Bridge of Khazad-Dum music, or the Lothlorien motiff, or the recent Rohan theme, etc. Harry Potter is in every way surpassed by Lord of the Rings, in story, performances, effects, sets, cinematogaphy, editing, and of coarse soundtrack. John Willams has done many more superior scores and I don't think Harry Potter is his best, or even close, and he will never be immediately identified with Harry Potter. John Williams will always be remembered by Star Wars( especially the Imperial March), Indiana Jones, Jaws, Schindler's List, or any other score in which he has worked. And he is not getting bad, I liked the Minority Report score, and I also loved the Catch Me if you Can score, but Harry Potter is not that great, first of all, it does not accompany a magnificent movie, unlike his other scores, and it's I think the score which he has copied most of it(from his own work and some of other, try comparing the Harry Potter with the Enemy at the Gates score ans see for yourselves). Spielberg turned Harry Potter down, and that says something about tha movie doesn't it, so, please, Harry Potter was good/average, but I would take days of Lord of the Rings in every aspect, including it's soundtrack which can be listened and you get the feel of opera, instead of Harry Potter and it's little tunes. In awards, Harry Potter lost the two or three noms. it had agaisnt Lord of the Rings, it critical response, Lord of the Rings had more praise than Potter, in box-office, althought the first Potter won more than The Fellowship, it was just for about 4 millions, and Two Towers surpassed Chamber for a great amount, almost 100 millions. Everything suggests that the One Ring beats the Boy Who Lived, and in soundtrack it does by a HUGE, MINDBLOWING amount.
B00005YUNY|5.0|What!?  Steve Howe's guitar tone is as always-very good- and unique.  Nothing wrong with it on this video.  Also he is well into his fifties and perhaps, just perhaps, over the big 60.  It doesn't become any player to jump around like a twenty year old and maintain any kind of dignity.  What used to look boring on Eric Clapton now becomes him at age whtaever. (Just standing there that is)  Now they hold their own with the most austier bluesmen. The orchestra made things a bit compact at times.  That young fellow filled in good for Wakeman.
B00005JLKB|4.0|With Buffy no longer on that leaves 24 and SmallVille as my 2 favorite shows. Smallville is a coming of age Superman series with Clarke Kent dealing with being a teenager and with being from another planet with super powers. Clarke slowly starts to get  powers such as x-ray vision in this season and in season 2 learns he can shoot lazors from his eyes. It's nice to see how Superman learns to deal with having powers. I mean in the movies he acts as if he had powers all along.<br />  In Smallville you get too see that when his powers come to him slowly they actually scare him. That's actually better done than the scenes where Peter Parker learns that he can shhot webs in Spiderman. In that it's taken as a joke and his powers don't scare him as much as they should when we first learns of them. When Clarke learns he can shoot lazers he carefully masters how to control it so he doesn't hurt someone on accident.<br />  Anyway Smallville's only problem is that it can have these silly X-Files like villains that you know are no match for Clarke. It's still satisfying and cool to see how he takes care of each one of them though. The show can also be annoying how Clarke and Lana have a Dawson and Joey type relationship. Clarke likes her, she likes him but she has a b/f that stands between them being together. Most episodes end with them bonding and looking into each others eyes and smiling at each other \\"makes you want to scream out, Kiss already!\\".<br />  The show is still 10 times better than any of the other Superman shows that have come along in recent years. It's more serious and darker than Louis and Clarke. It's sorta like Superman meets Buffy meets the X-Files meets Dawsons Creek lol. What makes it like Buffy is that he has sort of his own Scooby gang as well. He has his wanna be jock friend Pete and his conspiracy believer friend Cloey who also has a huge crush on him. Surprisingly enough Clarke is also good friends with Lex Luther (Michael Rosembalm from Urban Legend).<br />  Michael Rosembalm who had  short lived WB shows before Smallville is excellent as Lex Luther.  Hell he might actually be better than Gene Hackman. He plays Lex as he slowly becomes bad. You see the good...yet bad in him as he struggles to not be like his dad in each episode. Tom Welling is also awesom as Clarke Kent. What makes this show so good is that the performances are as interesting and engaging as the plots of each episodes. If you aren't into this show and think it's too mushy for you, I think you need to watch it to see what you have been missing. It has it's mushy romantic side to it to attract women viewers but it also has enough action and intrigue to attract male viewers as well. So what are you waiting for ?

0140186409|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it certainly is the most American.  John Steinbeck shows us the same place every time, but it's a place worth going to, where the hills roll dustily to infinity and the horses run free; where there are men who will never stop &quot;westering&quot;; where men are MEN--something that seems more than a little obvious, but when you compare Steinbeck with other authors you realize it just isn't so.  The book centers on one of the most unjust, trying, disgusting (call it what you will) times in America, and by the end you ARE one of the heroes, one of the simple men, one of the hardy westerers who only have each other and know it, but also know that that's all they need.  The book is, if anything, far more necessary now, for Steinbeck's breed of men have faded from our America, and only a book like the Grapes of Wrath could ever bring them back.  Read it; it's not only worth your while, it's worth America's.
B000000OAA|5.0|This album is quite arguably the greatest Queen album of all time. It has everything from Brian May's sublime guitar harmonys to Freddie Mercury's outstanding vocal stylings. 'Killer Queen' is one of Queen's greatest hits along with the dandruf shaking 'Now I'm Hear' plus there are lesser but equally amazing classics like the metal driven 'Stone Cold Crazy' (covered by Metallica) and the catchy, rock/rag-time 'Bring Back Leroy Brown'. A must for any fan of Queen or truly amazing classic rock/metal. I won't tell you twice...Buy it! They spoil you with this one!
B00008LDPU|4.0|This DVD wasn't too bad. My favorite were the first 4 stories, even though two episodes were one long story. The only story I didn't like was the last one, I just dont understand how loading a machine into a program converts him. But oh well. I have to say that *most* of the animation was very good. Overall this was a pretty good DVD, but I would only reccomend a purchase for the &quot;hard core&quot; fans, because it's kind of repetive. For the rest of you I'd say either use or get your Blockbuster card.
B00005JM1F|3.0|I realize that one shouldn't judge movies such as this by the same standards as serious drama, but even by the normal standards of such college-related comedies, &quot;Old School&quot; comes up short.<br />Don't get me wrong; it's not horrible--it's just that it's not all that it might have been.  For one thing, the &quot;unrated&quot; edition barely merits an R rating; for another, Vince and Luke's roles were woefully underwritten.<br />&quot;Say It Isnt' So&quot; &amp; &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; are just two recent titles that far outscore &quot;Old School&quot; in the laughs department.<br />Better luck next time, boys.  Until then, save your money!
B00005AQF7|5.0|Amazing!  The best music!  The beat in this CD perfectly matches with slow and fast belly dance moves.  The beat naturally moves my body from deep inside.  I especially like to perform with That Shiznit, Serial Killa, and Pump Pump.  Male ego fantacy lyrics bother me, but I learn to accept them as mens' releave from the reality.  I fast forward the talking part anyway.  Japanese belly dancer, Baby Y
0393057658|4.0|Lewis' account of the Oakland A's during a few years in the late 1990s when Billy Beane was their General Manager is a good look inside the strategy of baseball.  How do teams select players, which players will be most effective over their careers, and what player traits lead to victories?  These are the questions that Billy Beane has considered and reconsidered since he took over the helm of the low-budget Oakland team and found himself competing against teams like the New York Yankees, who could spend three times as much on player salaries.<br />Through heresies like reading the number-crunching of Bill James drafting fat ballplayers, and worrying more about On Base Average than fielding skills, Beane both outrages the baseball establishment and builds successful teams that make the playoffs and stay on budget.<br />This is a good book.  You may not agree with Beane's strategy -in fact, that's precisely the point- but the book is well-researched and well-written.  Lewis has done his homework.  I only wish he'd talked to more people who disagree with Beane's approach.  Over and over we read that Beane is an innovative genius with a Midas touch, but we never read any of the arguments against his strategy.  A bit more balance would have been nice.  But overall, this is good reading for the serious baseball fan.
B00006CJOY|3.0|I own Clandestino, which I thought was amazing.  I was disappointed with this CD because of it's repetitive nature.  I thought the music all sounded the same.<br />I did not even make it through the whole album.  Only die-hard fans should look into this one.
B000002JQ6|3.0|AC/DC Live is an okay live album that while containing most of their classics suffers from extensive overdubbing and isn't completely representative of their best work. The performances also lack the fire of their first live album, If You Want Blood, You've Got It.<br /><br />The album contains their best and most popular tracks from 1979 to 1990 such as the hard-rock classics \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"For Those About To Rock\\", \\"Highway Hell\\", \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" It also includes the strongest tracks from The Razor's Edge album, \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Moneytalks.\\" It also contains \\"The Jack\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", which are great tracks, but there are better versions on If You Want Blood, You've Got It. The only songs from their late-80s albums are an excellent version of \\"Heatseeker\\" and \\"Who Made Who.\\" There are no tracks here from the Flick Of The Switch and Fly On The Wall albums which is unfortunate because tracks like \\"Sink The Pink\\" and \\"This House Is On Fire\\" would have made this album stronger and more definitive. The 2-disc version of this album is a little better but contains too many tracks from The Razor's Edge album and only one track from two of their best albums Highway To Hell and For Those About To Rock. I'd recommend this to fans who want the greatest hits because most of them are here. But the album sounds way too much polished in the studio and could have been a stronger song collection.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is funny, it has so many funny lines, that you can taunt your enemies for years to come, using lines from THe Holy Grail. Monty Python may be a bit of a refined humour, that has it's fans and the non-fans who just don't like it. That's fine, this was my second Python movie ( after Eric the Viking) and I fell deeply for this humor. <BR>THe Python Boys take on so many different roles that they themselves said they loose track of who's who. The speicla edition DVD has behind scenes features, which is long and total eye candy for a fan.
B00005JLYU|4.0|Charlie's Angels is pure cheesecake. The sequel, Full Throttle, ups the ante in both terms of cheese and cake. <br />But if you are looking for an action movie that doesn't take it self too seriously with a good dose of comedy thrown in, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the ultimate tongue in cheek, campy, action flick. Everything about the first film is basically just increased a level for this film. In other words, if you enjoyed the first film, you should love this film. It's the perfect sequel that doesn't try to mess with the formula. In fact, it's almost the exact same formula, just with better action scenes and bigger special effects. This can sometimes be a bad idea as people who really didn't like the first film, should dislike this one as well. <br />I find myself having difficulty reviewing this film because of it's nature. Things in this movie that would be critiques of other films are part of this movie's charm. It's not the best movie ever. It's not even the best movie of the year. But for what it is, it's extremely entertaining. <br />Charlie's Angels is one of those great popcorn flicks that knows it's not a serious film that allows critical people like me to sit back and enjoy it for what it is without nitpicking it's various flaws. Who cares? Just bring on more of the campy goodness!
B000099T2L|4.0|The first time I was really impressed by Destiny's Child was when I heard the singles from the album called The Writing's On the Wall.  Those singles are infectious, yet I was not ashamed to admit it (like I was to admit that I couldn't get Britney Spears' songs out of my head).  Then, I was really blown away when I heard \\"Independent Women, Pt. 1\\" and \\"Survivor\\" and I had to purchase that album.  I listened to it so much that that formula was stuck in my head.    However, I now like that track, and \\"Crazy In Love\\" was another shocker, but I got used to it much more quickly.  I was very concerned about this album, but I purchased it, anyway.  At first, the only tracks I liked were \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\", and \\"Daddy\\" (a hidden track).  I felt like the CD basically became a mess after the first 3 tracks.  However, I now find the CD to be exceptional.  One problem I have with it is that \\"Signs\\" features someone obnoxiously calling \\"REWIND\\", which really interrupts the song (and the Missy part is really pointless and strange...I don't know what the hell she was thinking...she's usually very tasteful).  I've also been having trouble getting used to Beyonce's Houston accent, but this is almost insignificant.  This is definitely a CD for those who are fairly experienced in love.  Unless you hate slow songs, buy this album!

B00006HBUA|5.0|This is a really good movie. This is the best movie based on a cartoon ever.The story is realy good. The actors do a good job portraying the characters. The costumes look goofy only at the beginning of the movie. There is some raelly cool stuff on this DVD too.
B00005JM03|4.0|It seems the narrow streets of Paris are a favorite ground for film mavens to stuff dizzying traffic into. What \\"Ronin\\" did a few years ago and to a lesser extent \\"Bourne Identity\\" did as recently as last year, \\"Italian Job\\" takes one step further: sweat-your-palms car chase cameos. Only, the setting is LA.<br />Mini Cooper (now a BMW number) makes it possible with all the slickness of a lean and mean vehicle and the climax shots are dazzling. If you are looking for an old fashioned fast-paced action flick, this is your bag.<br />The story is not altogether unpredictable (barring a couple of decent plot twists), in fact the basic theme is based on Michael Caine's 1969 movie of the same name. The action is of a typical 21st century variety, but without any of the computer-aided farces as in \\"Matrix Reloaded\\". Charlize Theron oozes sex appeal, Norton is pretty convincing in his bad guy role (I am actually beginning to like this guy).<br />A fairly decent reason to grab some weekend popcorn.
0805062971|5.0|From the attention the movie received, I think many people were expecting your typical action story with tons of fighting. I wasn't even really anxious to see the movie, and I pride myself on enjoying action based movies (especially in a society where everyone thinks the only thing women enjoy watching is romance). Hollywood made it seem like it had the most basic of plots, nothing that would take a lot of thinking on the viewers' part. Wrong. After seeing the movie and grasping the complexity of the plot, I knew I had to read the book.<br />Chuck Palahnuik presents the story of an average guy. I'll call him \\"Joe Average\\" for the sake of this review. Joe Average could be anyone in today's capitalist America. He has a decent job, a decent place to live, a decent car; he pays his taxes, doesn't question \\"the man\\", consumes from that which he produces. He probably sounds like someone you know. Heck, he could even sound like YOU!<br />Joe Average can't sleep well. After unsuccessful treatment from the doctors, he discovers the joys of group therapy.  He doesn't have an illness, but the sob stories told during the sessions make him realize that his \\"problems\\" aren't so bad. What could be worse than people with brain tumors, men who have breast from testosterone ratios, and people with blood parasites? With that knowledge in mind, he finds it easier to sleep at night because he could have it worse. This is his relief until he meets Marla Singer. She like him is a faker, and in Joe Average's mind, she's ruining it for him. For the first time, he is unable to release his own \\"problems\\" during these group sessions, and the insomnia returns - thus clearing the way for more serious problems while making a new \\"friend\\", if you will, of Marla Singer.<br />Not too long after Marla ruins his \\"joy\\", Joe Average meets Tyler Durden on one of his business trips. He first spots Tyler on a deserted beach trying to build a large sun clock. Tyler isn't the type of friend you bring home to mother. He splices images of genitalia into movies. He's mocking, opinionated, smug, and perhaps even dangerous. After a freak accident concerning his home and car (oh the horror!), Joe Average finds himself in a bar with Tyler. After releasing the woes of being fatherless children (among other things), Tyler tells Joe Average to hit him, and the Fight Club is born.<br />This story delves into the complexity of one man's life who's fed up with his average life. Readers watch as Mr. Average sinks into a life while the law of the land is settled by furious fists. Sick of the weak lives they lead in corporate America, Joe Average-as well as other men trapped in the monotony of life-battle it out in the basement of bars. Tyler and Joe Average build a mantra for men who are sick of their lives. They establish a wide-spread dogma for men who are tired of being corporate America's lapdog. However, this freedom doesn't come without consequences. Nothing this good-this free-comes without repercussions.<br />Fight Club is definitely a must read for those of us who like books that probes deeper than what can be seen. It explores the psychological state of Joe Average, his struggles with society. If you're looking for a good book filled with pointless violence, this probably isn't for you, but if you're looking for something that digs a little deeper, you'll probably find that in Fight Club.to mother.

0385509456|5.0|\\"I am in a special needs school, but everyone has special needs\\", so says Christopher, an autistic teenager who goes to a school for \\"special\\" kids, but despite his condition, is bent on solving the brutal killing of a neighbor's dog. No this doesn't turn into a wild goose chase as it would in your typical detective novel. There are no ulterior motives, suspects and thrills. Indeed that wouldn't be possible because our little sleuth in this case is someone suffering from Asperger's syndrome.<br /><br />Instead, we are presented with the world, the \\"case\\" and life from his point of view. These simple yet feeling perspectives are riveting. For instance, the boy does not believe metaphors. Metaphors are a way of talking about things in a way that they aren't, so metaphors are basically lies -- you laughed your socks off, it's raining cats and dogs, you are the apple of my eye. Can an apple fit into an eye? At the heart of Christopher's predicament is betrayal. His mother leaves his father. His father betrays him. He simply says, \\"Why can't you love me? Why can't you be straight?\\"<br /><br />On one level our little detective is arrested but on another he is a more incisive observer than you or I. His dislike for lies about the events he is recounting and his aversion to emotionalizing his observations lend the story a stripped-down precision that enables the author to talk about the big issues of love, mortality, loss, betrayal without sounding contrived.<br /><br />Such a brilliant debut from Mark Haddon. I feared I would be treading on a tripwire of sympathy-bombs when I bought the book, but it's a moving fast-paced read with a very intriguing \\"plot\\" that is not burdened by finding proofs and criminals, but by rummaging in the absurdities and idiosyncrasies of our lives.<br /><br />Highly recommended, for almost anyone in your family who can read.
B00008YLV2|5.0|I agree with most of the positive comments made about this DVD package. It is simply a condenced version of historic class and a film school that goes into every details of this event. But is this a bona-fide reference disc? Call me picky, but a DTS track is sorely missed here. You would think that a film which has won an Academy Award for its sound should have included the soundtrack which is known to recreate the cinematic experience most truthfully, yet only the Japanese version is getting this previlage (even the original version of Black Hawk Down DVD has the earth-shattering DTS). I found this more-than-often similar situation frustrating, especially for a person who truely loves the movie and hope the get the most out of a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;. Don't get me wrong, the extras, the picture quality and the Dolby Digital track are all superb, but as a DVD collector and an avid home-cinema fan, I just hate all these &quot;one step away from perfect&quot; DVD packages.<br />Perhaps the greedy distributors are planning for a &quot;Superbit Ultimate-Extreme-May-Or-May-Not-Be-The-Final Edition&quot;? Better get another job to save enough cash first and then wait for it.

B00005JLRT|1.0|Excited from the awesome trailer, I took off to the local theater to watch \\"Nemesis.\\"  What a major disappointment!  This was by far one of the worst Star Trek movies ever created.   It played out like some cheap, made-for-TV movie.  Campy scenes (such as a wedding scene), gobs of boring exposition, and a \\"nemesis\\" who does absolutely nothing but talk.  The best part of this entire flick was the first 5 minutes where the senate is turned to stone.  After that, it's camp-city!  Baird could have spared us from the sex scene between commander Riker and counselor Troi.  \\"Contact\\" w/the borg lady is the best so far...

0440237688|5.0|I've grown fond of children's books.  We take better care of our children than we do ourselves. We encourage our children to eat their vegetables whether we do ourselves or not.  We encourage them to play outside whether we exercise or not.  We care about what they are allowed to read, while we read trash.<br />We should be concerned about what our children read.  Reading is an intimate experience.  When we read, we let someone else come inside our brains, walk around, and leave things. Sticks and stones can break your bones, but books can change the way you think. We are right to care about the sorts of things our children invite into their minds, and this concern has led to a children's literature that's better in many respects than what is supposed to be \\"adult\\" literature.<br />I was converted to children's books in stages, as my children started being interested in reading, but the final step-the icing on the cake-was a book entitled The Giver, by Lois Lowry. It can be read in a few hours, but that does not decrease its impact, which is something like that of a sledgehammer. It is the story of a boy named Jonas who lives in what seems to be an ideal world.  There is no crime, no hunger, and no dissatisfaction. Everyone is in the profession that best suits his talents. It appears to be ideal.  The Greeks had a word for a place like this, and that word was \\"Utopia\\".  It shows the keen insight of those old Greeks that the word means \\"nowhere\\".  Nowhere is perfect. Nowhere is without problems.<br />While the Community in which Jonas lives is without strife, it also lacks a great many other things.  On the way to achieving the \\"perfect\\" community, certain sacrifices have been made. Jonas discovers this when he turns twelve and is assigned his life profession, The Receiver of Memories.  Part of the price paid for utopia is loss of connection to the past. The children of the Community are not raised by their biological parents, but by foster parents who are deemed suitable for the job of parenting. After the children of the community are grown, they lose connection with their foster parents, so even family history is lost.  One might think about the impact this would have on the situation in the Middle East. There wouldn't be any fighting for the Promised Land.  The Promise would all be a part of the forgotten past.  For those of us who would like to see peace, this notion might be quite appealing.<br />However, Lowry's insight is that a person without a past is a person without a future.  While there is virtue to be had by living in the present in the metaphorical sense, living entirely in the present without connection to the Eternal is sterile.<br />Jonas's role as Receiver of Memory is necessary for the Community because basic survival does require some knowledge of the human past, but this knowledge is a great burden, as human history is full of pain.  The Receiver of Memory remembers these unpleasant things so others won't have to.  The decision was made to remove this unpleasantness from the Community's conscience.  In reading this, I was reminded that some people shudder at the bloody passages in the Old Testament and regret their inclusion in the Bible.  Sometimes fiction is not far from the truth.<br />But in forgetting pain, much that was pleasant has also been forgotten: Snow, sunny days, and the love of a family.  Bad weather is inconvenient, and so the weather is controlled.  Sexual yearnings cause problems, and so they are eliminated by taking a pill.  Even love has been removed.<br />This brings up another theme of the book, the use of language. Children are continually urged to use language precisely.  Once Jonas asks his foster father if he loves him and is told that love is a meaningless word.  His foster father says that he is very fond of Jonas, but that he couldn't possibly love him because there is no such thing.<br />Yet we, the reader, know that there is such a thing, and in the course of gaining the memories of the community, Jonas discovers not on does love exists, but that he is capable of it in its deepest form.<br />Though there is never an explicit reference to religion, one might almost see The Giver as sequel to the story of the Fall of Man in the book of Genesis.  In eating from the Tree of Knowledge, Man is separated from nature and separated from God.  Mans knowledge of the universe and how to manipulate it enables him to control.  The world shown in The Community in The Giver is one that logically follows from that separation.  The Community controls everything, the weather, and the sexual urges of the young.  The separation from nature is complete, and perhaps so is the separation from God.<br />The theologians have a name for the complete separation from God, and that name is \\"Hell.\\"  Hell is not usually presented as being so clean as the Community, nor its people as being so polite, but somehow I do believe that, like the Community, Hell is made-to-order by man.<br />The most frequent complaint that one sees about the book is about its ending.  It would be an understatement of massive proportions to say that my twelve-year-old, the Middle-Child, found the ending to be very frustrating.  However, it need not be if one takes it at face value, and that is all I am going to say.<br />The next time you would like a good, short read, and if you are tired of being force-fed someone else's sexual fantasies, let me recommend The Giver.  If nothing else, it will make you think.community, Jonas discovers not on does love exists, but that he is capable of it in its deepest form.<BR>Though there is never an explicit reference to religion, one might almost see The Giver as sequel to the story of the Fall of Man in the book of Genesis.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Forget whatever awards the Academy handed out in March, this is the best picture of the year, not \\"Chicago\\".  Martin Scorsese once again proves that he is the best director in the business with this tribute to the old epics of yester-year.  With a film industry infatuated with box office success instead of critical success, this film provides hope that there is creativity left in the movie biz.  Scorsese is known for making films with great characters like Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta, and now Bill \\"The Butcher\\".  Daniel Day-Lewis is dead perfect in this role and the film comes alive every time he is on screen; he creates one of the best villains in film history.  The art direction, cinematography, editing, scoring, acting, costume design, and directing are great and should have won Oscars.  Scorsese not only pays tribute to epic story telling, but to cinema itself.  \\"Gangs of New York\\" embodies everything great American filmmaking stands for.  This is the first great film of the century, and one of the best of all time.
B000099T2L|4.0|I didn't know what to expect for Beyonce's solo debut, but since she sang lead on all the DC albums, I didn't expect this album to be much different--pop-infused beats, some more &quot;she-power/independent woman&quot; declarations.  But surprise--there's hardly any of that on this album which is both good (if you're tired of the same old sound) and a bit dissappointing (if you were ready for another anthem, which I kind of was!) Simply put, alot of EMOTIONS are placed on the table for this album--she flirts, she lusts, she wails, she loves, she loses, she lives to tell the tale again.  If the attempt was to make this album one that could still be refreshing to hear years from now, I have to applaud her on the attempt.  Alot of things, notably her singing style and range on some songs, caught me off guard at first, but by the second time I played the CD I was hooked.  It's easier for me to give a personal breakdown for each song:<br />(1)&quot;Crazy in Love&quot; (4/5): You've heard this one by now.  When you get a break from the constant airplay, it really is a good song w/ an infectious beat.<br />(2)&quot;Naughty Girl&quot; (4/5): This song really took me by surprise for the simple fact that she sings entirely in a range higher than the way we're used to hearing her sing.  By the second time I played it, I was hooked. Very smooth, very nice.<br />(3) &quot;Baby Boy&quot; (3/5): I'm not a big reggae fan so it's going to take a while to grow on me.  It does have a rather nice beat, though.<br />(4) &quot;Hip Hop Star&quot; (5/5): One of the few up-tempo tracks on the album and one of my FAVORITES! She really pushes the envelope w/ this one and while the rock-like beat is unexpected, it works great, especially with the rap combo.<br />(5) &quot;Be With You&quot; (2/5): The first of many slow songs on the album.  It has an old-school flavor.  Nice, but it doesn't grab me.<br />(6) &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot; (4/5): This beat is kind of old-school, too, but I really loved this one. The flow is great and so is her voice.  Very good message too.<br />(7) &quot;Yes&quot; (3/5): Another slow one.  It's rather good but the only thing I really liked was the hand-clap beat throughout the song.  It's growing on me.<br />(8) &quot;Signs&quot; (4/5): What a difference a week makes!  When I first heard this song I was disappointed because since it was produced by M.E., I was expecting something harder, more infectious even with it being a slow song. The more I listened to it, though, the more I liked it and Beyonce's voice REALLY shines on this one. The chorus can be a bit much at times, though.<br />(9) &quot;Speechless&quot; (2/5):Another slow one--VERY slow one! Nice, but it doesn't grab me.<br />(10)&quot;That's How You Like It&quot; (3/5): A mid-tempo break from the slow songs.  Since it featured Jay-Z, I was expecting something a bit more harder beat wise, but it's still a nice song.<br />(11)&quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; (3/5):  The duet w/ Luther Vandross sounds great but it kind of felt out of sync with the rest of the album.  Still a beautiful song, though.<br />(12)&quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot; (5/5): If you heard this song on the &quot;Survivor&quot; album or on the numerous occasions recently when she's performed it, it's no different given an extra beat or additional piano in the background.  I still love this song.<br />(13)&quot;Beyonce Interlude&quot; (2/5): I didn't get this.  It's not really long enough to be considered an interlude or have it's own track listing.  Like a mini-poem, but it's kinda touching.<br />(14)&quot;Gift from Virgo&quot; (2/5): Another slow one.  I admire the originality because it actually sounds like she's reciting a love letter/poem OVER the beat instead of singing WITH the beat, but it just doesn't grab me yet.<br />(15)&quot;Song for Daddy&quot;(4/5): This was a surprisingly great and touching tribute to her father.  Actually I have to say the range and emotion that she puts in this song is what I wished she had done on a few other songs on the album.  Very good.<br />Over all, there were a good number of surprises with this album, which is refreshing these days.  For a solo debut, she's proven her versatility and has done a great job in the process.had done on a few other songs on the album.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Without Doubt Christina Aguilera Has returned with sheer fire power and is ready to take the world by storm. Opening the album with the Stripped Intro allows the listener to understand the concept of this album... which is getting to know the real her. She unvails truths about everyday society and gender boundaries in \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"... while heading into a ballad of addiction \\" Walk Away.\\" She takes you from her strong anthem of being a \\"Fighter\\" to allowing you to get down and \\"dirrty\\" with her. However the real Highlight in the album is when Christina takes you through the disturbing track that reflects her childhood... \\"I'm Okay.\\" She makes no appologies with this record and simply had a few things to say... if everyone were as genuine, the Music world would definitly be a place of reverence.
0099429985|4.0|This is the first book I read from this author.  It prompted me to go out and purchase the rest of her books.<br />Marian Keyes writes so you are pulled into the story in the first few pages.  I was recommended this one on a few book message boards so now I am hooked!!
0066214122|1.0|This book stunk.  I always finish books I start; but, this one was torture to get through.  Crichton has to stop the &quot;action&quot; during almost every chapter to explain some non-sensical and ultimately irrelevant scientific concept.  The main character alternates between monumentally stupid, then genius, then stupid again.  It was very frustrating.<br />Don't believe the good reviews of this book.  They must have been written by the Publisher or one of Crichton's relatives.  Trust me and skip this one.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Okie~> This movie was one of if not the only movie that was ever capable of capturing my attention and keeping it for the entire duration of the film. (and that's saying something considering the length!) After seeing the Two Towers I was so excited for the rest that I went out and read The Return of the King (awesome book), and now I'm a Lord of the Rings junkie. The battle of Helm's Deep WAS AMAZING!!! The uruki (i think thats how you spell it) were so realistic and truly terrified me. An amazing film... rent it~>watch it~>love it~>buy it
B00005JLYU|5.0|For anyone who loved the first movie, this is hands down a must see.  Cameron, Lucy, and Drew all seriously rock as the angels.  While the first movie was a modest action film with a witty sense of humor, Full Throttle goes all out with big action scenes, more jokes, and more skin.  (And of course, more Moore.)  <br />The movie parades around from one action sequence, to one musical sequence, to a comedy sequence, doubles up and goes through it all over again.  A lot of action movies these days seem really hollow and mass market produced for a dime a dozen, but through McG's direction and the hot stars, Full Throttle never lets up and never feels old or tired.  <br />Some of the scenes I really liked were the opening rescue (which had a lot of action, plus a lot of laughs), the high powered motor cycle race, and the over-the-top pussycat strip dance!<br />I have to admit, Bearnie Mac was a pretty good Bosley, but I liked Bill Murry better in the role.  However, one newcomer I liked a lot more was Ms. Moore.  Demi rocked the house in this movie!  She's the baddest and hottest angel you could image, and I loved seeing her on the screen.    <br />I'm not sure if the angels will come back yet again.  If McG and the girls can pull it off, I'd love it.  But, I'm thinking the franchise might run out of steam if a third film is made.  But, we'll see.  <br />Overall, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is like a big party you'll have a blast at for 2 hours.  My advice: have fun!
B000002J1B|5.0|What the hell?? My first impressions of this outstanding Yes-Album led me to sounds I never heard before...<BR>\\"Relayer\\" is such an impressive album, one can still hear how  Steve Howe plays his incredible guitar on this Yes master-pieces, how Chris Squire got everything out of his bass-guitar. A milestone of rock/progressiv music, Yess offering a grandious symphonic play. If someone needs a proof of the divinity of some Yes albums, get start listining to what the band already played in the early 70s and resume that their music will never die!!
0684857219|3.0|Some people obviously have a tendency to flip through Arnold's book and go straight to the section designed for very advanced bodybuilders. If you aren't already quite huge, defined, and cut up, you do not fit this category. I've looked through this book very carefully, and Arnold does not, for instance, recommend 20 sets per body part for beginners by any stretch of the imagination. If he really did, as some people are saying, I would agree completely that this book was a crock. Think about it. How many years of actual intense training do you have behind you. If you are a beginner, and you probably are whether you like to admit it or not, you should read carefully enough to discover that Arnold was several years of very intense training separated from that by the time he was following such a schedule.       For us beginners to intermediates, Arnold recommends a very different program that might take you up into the ten set range at the most. Look at any real body builder and notice the fact that the pectoral, for example, is subdivided into more than one functional area. This doesn't matter much to someone who is just a beginner, since such people can make gains without necessarily doing more than a few sets per exercise. Just feel what happens in the muscles as you work out. Different exercises work different areas in muscles that are comprised of more than one unit (such as, for example, the deltoids.)      We must remember that Arnold is exceptionally gifted and that, therefore, when he is talking about advanced he means someone who is getting up to a very high level in the sport of bodybuilding, in addition to having a lot of years under the belt, though not quite to the point of getting onto the stage with the greats.      I don't know personally if Arnold has or has not used steroids. However, it only seems sensible that, considering the huge variations sometimes present between humans at the outer edges of a standard bell curve, that his natural testosteronelevels could be exceptionally high. Also, there is some scientific evidence confirming that some of the specific exercise he recommends actually substantially raises the testosterone levels of the lifter. Check the databases for the exercise physiology journals.       Finally, in some instances I can see why there might be confusion. One of the problems with placing a book on the market that contains advanced techniques is the simple fact that people will jump the gun and think they are ready. Arnold could have better stressed where exactly you should be before stepping up to the next level. Also, while it is necessary to gain weight if you want to be as big as Arnold (assuming that you can) it is not stressed adequately that such gains in weight are useless if not made up mostly of muscle. Just eating like a pig isn't enough.
B000069HKH|5.0|I think this is one of Boss' best. I would rate it third on my favorites. The guy had it in 1975, and has it in 2003. My top 3 are The Rising, Lonesome Day and You're Missing. The Rising is great. As is mostly every Springsteen album.  Being back with the E Street Band makes a huge difference for this album.  The gutiar solo's are screaming, drum solo's powerful andf it's great.  I think it could do without \\"Lets Be Friends\\".  It's not Bruce.  Go with this album.  You won't regret it.
B00005JLYU|5.0|Thiz Movie is soo good I Loved it im going to buy the DVD as soon as it comes out yes i am ...
B00006BTCA|5.0|Being an avid Joy Division fan, echoes of that sound were the first thing to jump out at me upon first listen. Although I enjoyed the entire album immensely, my initial reflex was to think this album as something derivative...or tributary, but time has changed my mind on this. <br />Threads of various influences can be heard here and there throughout TOTBL, however riding on top of it all is a certain character and vitality that is all Interpol's own. It has a personal feel, and I think the familiar sounds have been respectfully and carefully used rather than the wholesale wallpaper job some have suggested. <br />One complaint I have about alot of modern music today is how polished and produced it all feels. Even in the more independent efforts, so much potential seems lost in the drive to produce and market rather than just honestly create. It has taken away that 'edge' alot of earlier independent efforts always had. I can sense that edge in this album, and it's refreshing to hear something so well put together that can manage it in this digital age.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peolpe keep on saying that this movie did not include everything from the book...true, but I would like to see them do better than Peter Jackson has done! Fitting everything from the book into one film would be extremely hard without upsetting the audience because of the long running time. Hopefully the true LOTR fans will get back scenes that were not in the movie from the special edition DVD, and will be satisfied. This movie will go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time! I hope Peter Jackson gets an Oscar for all this...
0385474547|1.0|I'm not going to tell any one not to read this novel because of my personal opinion. It is up to you to decide on how to interpret or accept this novel. I, myself, found it boring and unmoving. Yes, I am interest in learning about other cultures, but I think this could have been written better. I also believe it needed a deeper meaning, without simple symbolism everyone tends to exhaust. I only see this a novel worth reading if you're not looking for depth.
B000099T2L|5.0|When I first got Beyonce Album I thought it would sound like the destiny's child songs but it didn't. Her sound is very different from the others. I mean when I first heard it I thought it was strange but when you listen again I fell in love with the Album I have to listen to it everyday. I like all her songs except Hip Hop Star I don't know what she was thinking there but the as for the rest of the album it's da bomb I can't wait until the Next Destiny's Child Album they been away to long but if you're a true fan of Beyonce then get the Album because it's hot. I give it 6 stars!!!!!!!!!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Ever since the release of the Grammy award-winning &quot;Buena Vista Social Club,&quot; Ry Cooder has stuck to Cuban music. He has probably become the second most popular living soul connected to the island right behind comandandte Fidel Castro. However, he is not become of those cheesy artists trying to experiment with what they should not be touching in the first place, Cooder obviously does FEEL the essence of traditional Cuban music. With &quot;Mambo Sinuendo&quot; Cooder creates an album of great atmosphere, evoking the sounds of the Cuban coast from the 50's but also adds some modern flourishes that nicely create an evocative hybrid as in &quot;Monte Adentro.&quot; The second name billed here is Manuel Galban, he and Cooder both create with their guitars notes of wonderful delicacy and elegance, with real style and flavor. There is also memorable slide guitar work here that truly creates an atmosphere. The reason why we should praise Cooder and not condemn him for his artistic impulses in the Latin American music scene is because he truly does present some great stuff. &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; was an album of great beauty and &quot;Mambo Sinuendo&quot; is a wonderfully beautiful extension with Cooder finally really taking the spotlight to show he is indeed capable of playing with the big boys of this genre. Just look at the really good rendition here of the classic &quot;Caballo Viejo&quot; which almost has a rock n' roll vibe going through it. There are also the two most romantic pieces here, &quot;Bodas De Oro&quot; and &quot;La Luna En Tu Mirada&quot; which vibrate with a beauty and elegance Ricky Martin wishes he could paint his superficial pop with. What &quot;Mambo Sinuendo&quot; eventually feels like is just a group of wonderful musicians jamming late at night by the oceanside.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Nothing against Sparta, but this album is 60 minutes of insanity voiced through instruments.  This record goes out and makes a statement.  They (Cedric &amp; Omar) didnt' want to be another cookie-cutter band that sounded like everyone else.  Instead, they made one of the best albums of the year.  Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of), Eriatarka, Cicatriz and Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt are my favorite songs.  <br />From a long time At the Drive-In fan, it feels like they've finally come home.  This album is awesome and you should be buying it now.  Buy it now at 10.00 before it jacks up to 14.99.

B00005JKPF|5.0|\\"X2: X-men United\\" is the movie that SHOULD have been put out instead of 2000s X-men.<br />THE STORY:<br />In this sequel, the mutants are faced with an even greater threat.  Following a Presidential assassination attempt by a mutant, the community at large, already full of anti-mutant sentiment, begins to call for even greater sanctions against mutant-kind.  The X-men are soon forced to join forces with the mutant terrorist Magneto to stop a hate-Mongers insidious plot and to simply ensure the continuation of the mutant race.<br />THE COOL STUFFS:<br />Going far beyond the first movie, even more mutants from the comics make appearances in this movie including Beast, Siryn, Colossus, Shadowcat, etc.  The action sequences in this film are MUCH improved from the first one. Making their \\"major\\" debuts in this film are Iceman, Pyro, Nightcrawler and Deathstrike.<br />One of the great improvements in this movie is the simple fact that Wolverine is allowed more free reign in this film to simply kick butt.  One of my pet peeves with the first film was the amount of \\"pulling of punches\\" they did with the violence level.  That is not an issue with this film. Wolverine was allowed to go into \\"berserker\\" mode and cut the bad guys up in this film.<br />For comic purists some developments in this film include a further look into Wolverine's Weapon X background as well as Jean Grey's Phoenix powers.<br />PET PEEVES:<br />I still take SOME issue with the movie's disregard for the comic's original continuity and storylines.  Iceman and Rogue as well as Pyro are presented as classmates at Xavier's.  Oh well,  the improved action makes up for some of this.<br />Best Scenes:<br />1. Nightcrawler versus the Secret Service<br />2. Wolverine and Colossus defending the school<br />3. Pyro takes out the cops<br />4. Professor X uses Cerebro<br />5. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Waaaaay better than the first.  This is easily one of the best action films of 2003.  Can't wait for the third movie.<br />Highly Recommended
0060254920|5.0|We LOVE this one.  It's one of only 4 or 5 books that my toddlers keep asking me to read.  I remember it from childhood, but I forgot how fun it is!  My kids are 3 1/2 and 2 years old and they love the repetitive parts, and the wild parts and the sweet homey ending to cranky boy being sent to bed.
B00004XONN|4.0|I tried my hardest not to be a fair-weather fan when I found myself wishing for another OK Computer upon first listen of this disc.  Three years and seemingly worlds apart, the two albums almost seem as if they came from separate bands.  Kid A has the soundscape of a dream (best executed in \\"Treefingers\\"), whereas 1997's OK Computer is more grounded in barnstorming rock anthems.  However, it was the mindless bass line of \\"The National Anthem,\\" and NOT one of the melodically complex ballads from OK Computer that first grabbed my ears and sparked my interest in Radiohead.<br />Tracks \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"In Limbo\\" have a more radio-friendly format, a mix between Kid A's rough sound and OK Computer's guitar-driven numbers.  \\"Idiotheque,\\" which I first saw performed live on SNL, is Radiohead's attempt at creating a straight dance song.  Fortunately for us, they fail miserably; the quality of the lyrics remain brilliant, as ever.  Finally, the hidden track on \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" washes the listener in the musical equivalent of glittering blues and silvers, a surprisingly bright ending to a particularly shaded disc.<br />The more experimental tone of Kid A may baffle some listeners unfamiliar with the band, but with the third or fourth play-through a greater understanding of Radiohead's musical growth is achieved.
0385504209|5.0|Chilling fiction with enough religious realism to creep the jeebers out of you.  And replace it with the Heebs.  Great, creative, work that will have you in suspense from page one.  And once your done getting creeped out, try, The Little Guide To Happiness.  This book is also a great book.  The difference is that one will give you a good clean scare and the other will lift you up and have you smiling.  Both great books I picked up at the same time.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of the best films I have seen in years. Wonderfully done.
0393057658|1.0|I bought Moneyball sight unseen based on the recommendation of ESPN's Dan LeBatard to wit: \\"Lewis dissects how the Oakland Athletics have won more in recent years than . . . \\", \\"the A's are smarter than everyone else, and this book shows how\\", and \\". . . are now using science, math, formulas and Ivy League educations to help change how baseball is viewed, scouted, studied, and played.\\"  So while I didn't expect a scholarly work such as Fisher Black and Myron Scholes did on options pricing that ultimately led to winning the Noble Prize, I though the book would be somewhat analytical in nature; however, it doesn't contain one chart, graph, or table.  Instead it is filled with claims that are not backed up by data - though the implication is the data exists.  So what is about?  Primarily is it a number of vignettes from the 2002 season featuring Billy Beane (A's GM) and to a lesser extent Paul DePodesta (A's Harvard educated resident \\"quant\\").  So what are the major things we learn - or more correctly, what are the key unsubstantiated claims? (1) high school pitchers are twice less likely than college pitchers and four times less likely than college position players to make it to the major leagues; (2) the most important statistic is the number of runs a team scores and the only things that correlate with it are on-base percentage and slugging average; (3) managerial tactics such as the bunt, steal, and hit and run are either pointless or self-defeating; (4) every batter should possess the power to hit home runs because home run power forced pitchers to pitch more carefully and this leads to walks and high on-base percentages - so-called \\"small ball\\" is a losing strategy; (5) the value of speed, fielding, batting average, and RBIs is greatly overrated and therefore overpaid for; (6) the same is true for relief pitchers and closers; (7) an extra point of on-base percentage is worth three extra points of slugging percentage; (8) there is no such thing as a \\"clutch\\" hitter; (9) you can calculate an \\"expected run value\\" for every player; (10) the only criteria used for pitchers should be walks, strikeouts, and home runs - things like velocity, hits, and ERA are irreverent.<br />A very brief summary of the 12 chapters: 1 - Billy Beans high school years as a baseball phenom; 2 - Beane/DePodesta vs. the A's scouts on talent evaluation; 3 - Beane's minor/league career, move to front office, and \\"enlightenment\\" through Sandy Alderson; 4 - the baseball subculture of statistical analysis and people like Bill James, Carl Morris, Eddie Epstein, Dick Cramer, . . .; 5 - the Jeremy Brown story and the 2002 amateur draft; 6 - what the A's did when they lost Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen after the 2001 season that allowed them to win even more games in 2002; 7 - how they made up for Giambi's lost \\"expected run value\\"; 8 - the Scott Hatteberg story; 9 - mid-season trade for Ricardo Rincon; 10 - the Chad Bradford story; 11 - the night that A's won their 20th in a row; 12 - vindication as other teams (e.g., Toronto and Boston) adopt Oakland's methods of player evaluation.<br />One thing you have to understand is that statistical analysis works in the long-run.  So it works well for building a team for the 162 game regular season.  However, it does guarantee anything about the playoffs - \\"Tim Hudson, heretofore flawless in big games, and perfect against the Minnesota Twins, had two horrendous outings.

6304884419|5.0|I thought that this movie was all-around great. It was an astouding movie that couldn't have been better for the debut of De Niro's direction. It is a wonderful movie for mob fans and also it has a great love story to it. Excellent movie that I suggest to everyone.
B000089RVX|3.0|After hearing &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; I was certain that Evanescence was something special.  But to my extreme surprise, the album wasn't anything like the hit single.  While &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; had a more Linkin Park taste to it, the rest of the album went in all directions, and while this isn't really a bad thing, it proves that you shouldn't base your buying on one song.<br />Going Under - A fairly good, fairly catchy song that seems to repeat itself just a bit.  Not bad, but not exactly my favorite. {7/10}<br />Bring Me To Life - Majorly overplayed, but still manages to keep its value. Very catchy. {8/10}<br />Everybody's Fool - This song simply doesn't seem to fit on the album.  This song can be described in one word - pop. {5/10}<br />My Immortal - Somewhat of a depressing song, but Amy's vocals soar over a beautiful piano melody that's simply soothing and enchanting. {9/10}<br />Haunted - The song that attracted me to the album.  I liked most everything about the song, but it didnt take more than a week for me to grow tired of it. {7/10}<br />Tourniquet - Wow...&quot;Tourniquet&quot; absolutely blew me away.  This song shows some of the band's Christian values, and also poses a few questions.  There's also a little Romeo and Juliet in it.  Lovely. {9/10}<br />Imaginary - I must have played this song 200 times and I still yearn to hear it once again.  Imaginary is just a flat-out masterpiece, and the way it fits together with Tourniquet is simply amazing.  A perfect ten. {10/10}<br />Taking Over Me - I must say that this song, as compared to Imaginary, nearly lost me.  Though it is good, it just doesn't compare to the others.  {6/10}<br />Hello - Goodbye.{3/10}<br />My Last Breath - Also not one of the highlights of the CD, but not half bad either.  Pretty enjoyable.  {6/10}<br />Whisper - Whisper is a great way to end the CD.  It fits nicely with the majority of the songs and is just a fun song to listen to.  {8/10}
B00004XONN|5.0|This album and The Bends are in my opinion both compete masterworks. They are very different, almost polar opposites, but are equally good. Before buying this, be warned: this is NOT rock music. If you think you're going to get a rock album in buying this, then you are mistaken. All sorts of music styles blend here: electronica, jazz, folk, and classical, just to name a few. Some songs (&quot;Everything in its Right Place,&quot;  &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;) are lovely funeral dirges, while others  such as the Miles Davis-influenced &quot;National Anthem,&quot; Indian-sounding &quot;Optomistic,&quot; and utterly electronic &quot;Idioteque&quot; pull the listener out of the dreamscape presented by the rest of the album and into a firey inferno of sound. <br />This is not an album to be missed. Some may love it and some may hate it, but it surely won't be forgotten. If you like this, check out the Icelandic band Sigur Ros. Their first two CD's (Von and Agaetis Byrjun) greatly influenced Radiohead to move in this direction.
B0000931QR|5.0|La Oreja has now established themselves as the premier pop outfit from Spain.<br />This third disc showcases their best lyrics to date (Geografia, 20 de enero, rosas) and as always super catchy melodies  and songs that just flow.<br />The opener &quot;puedes contar conmigo&quot; starts off with a bang, as they's done on their 2 previous recordings. The next tune &quot;20 de Enero&quot; is my second favorite tune on this album as it features a catchy hook and peaks on the chorus, I think this one will be a hit for them. The best tune in my opinion is &quot;Un Mundo Mejor&quot; which has their Dile al Sol sound, this one highlights Amelia's beautiful, powerful voice. Also &quot;Geografia&quot; is a great one which has the potential to be a hit.<br />There are a few throw on's, but still there is enough great music on this one to make it worth the purchase. If you enjoy this one, check out also &quot;Fragil&quot; by Ana Torroja, &quot;Ciudades de Paso&quot; by Mikel Erntxun and &quot;Televisor&quot; by Moenia.
6304779356|5.0|This movie would have to be one of the best Vampire movie of all time!!  It is funny at times and is also a Horror Film but this movie is a rock n roll, vampire, party.<BR>The movie is R because there is violence and some language and is like a said funny this movie is worth buying
B00005RDSM|5.0|I had never seen Peter Pan in my childhood. My wife and daughter saw a sequel (I think) while in Perth, Ozzieland, and were thrilled. Feeling left out, I ordered this special edition. Not what they saw in the theater; but it is something that my daughter has averaged 5 runs a week for the last three months. If she fusses over her dinner - the mention of a time out for Peter Pan gets instant results.<BR>Now to go find the sequel!
B00005JLXC|5.0|The movie was really awesome!!  It had great stunts, AMAZING fight scenes and an overall good story.  The story was not terrific but it was fast paced and focused solely on the Daredevil.  It did a decent job and made this movie very entertaining.  Affleck did a great job as the Daredevil, Farrell as Bulleye was so cool, the cast was great!!  This movie does do a good job on focusing on Daredevil as a true hero and the stresses, struggles and depression that comes with its territory.  I just loved that aspect of the movie.  Can't wait to see the sequel!!
B00006M183|5.0|I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since their very first album, \\"Ten\\", in 1991 and this is their most mature album to date.  They started out as a typical grunge band - angry at the world and letting that anger show through in their music.  They were never ones to repeat old gripes and riffs though, always emerging with a different sound and lyrical moral each album, while at their core remaining true to what they do best - solid guitar-orientated hard rock.  No wandering off to experiment with synthesizers, tape loops, drum machines, and other useless c**p.  (Radiohead and U2, take note!).<br />In Riot Act the feelings expressed are more diverse than previously - less anger-centric - and are expressed in a more subtle sort of way.  The guitar solos are tighter, Eddie Vedder's vocals more measured and less of a scream.  His vocals have always been a highlight of Pearl Jam's music and now he goes to the next level, swapping pitch for tone.  His voice now more fully conveys the emotions and sentiments of the music, to the extent that one doesn't even have to understand the lyrics to grasp the emotions, a truly remarkable performance.  A great example of this is on \\"I am mine\\", for me the best track on the album.<br />The more mature sound may be a conscious effort on Pearl Jam's part, or simply a natural progression, being more mature, worldy-wise individuals now and not the naively bitter and angry youngsters they used to be.<br />A great album, though there has never been a bad Pearl Jam album.  \\"Binaural\\" is their worst offering, and that is a 3-star effort.  All the rest are 4 or 5 star albums, \\"Yield\\" still being my overall favourite, though Riot Act runs it close.
B00008O0WN|5.0|This movie was pretty good.  It had a great script and also a lot of unexpected surprises!!  Star Trek TNG fans will be shocked!!  This movie really show you how each of the characters grows and moves on but still manage to keep in touch with one another.  This was not the best Star Trek movie but it was most certainly not a failure.  There's also a lot of action and the usual flawless special effects.  Can't wait to see the next movie!  I hope the Q returns to challenge Picard!<BR>Get this DVD!
B00008WG3U|4.0|I have never heard any other NOFX album except this one.  ..., I'll just buy it!  I'm glad I bought it because now it is one of my favorite CDs.  At start, I didn't like it much but then again this is one of those albums that takes some time to get used to.<br />1. Separation of Church and Skate - This is currently my favorite track on the album now.  It starts out with a funny vocal introduction and cuts to guitar.  The lyrics are amazing and it even includes a guitar solo in the middle of the song.  Great starting song for an album also!<br />2. The Irrationality of Rationality - Another great song on the album.  The music is not as happy sounding as Franco Un-American or such songs but the song has a very well stated point about their views.  \\"The guilty don't feel guilty, they learn not to.\\"  Such lyrics make this song worth listening over and over again.<br />3. Franco Un-American - This was originally my favorite song on the album due to the music of this track.  It is awesome the first couple times you listen to it.  It's about not wanting to be an american...later on it became a little bit repetitive.  It has some nice drum beats around the end of the song.<br />That's only 3 songs I've sampled but you get the basic point.  Overall this was a real good CD and I enjoy listening to it even on a daily basis!  This ranks right up there with the most awesome punk rock albums.  Buy it now!
B00009V7T2|4.0|seriously, i've listened to this album, in it's entirety, at least five times in the last day and i'm still intrigued. i don't even completely understand it yet, but i love it.<br />from what i have heard, it's a concept album about a man (based on their childhood friend Julio Venegas) who goes into a coma, and the album takes place in the facets of that man's mind. the concept is a little overblown, but the music itself is incredible. It manages to be harsh, melodical, beautiful, stunning, dark, and enlightening all at once. I was only a mild fan of ATDI and i like sparta a little, but this is definately better (at least for my tastes). <br />Considering how incredible it is, along with the fact that it is available for a decent price (i got my copy for ten bucks), this would be a worthy purchase for any fan of this type of music (although &quot;this type of music&quot; can't specifically be identified).
B00009V7T2|5.0|The mars Volta is one of the greatest bands out today.  If you like any music whatsoever you must buy this cd. The great writing and musical talent of this bands almost makes you wonder why it took so long for this cd to come out, but then you realise that this cd was worth the wait. From the second i bought this cd it has been playing our in my pocket
B000006TRV|5.0|I was only 11 years old and growing up in a small town in England when this album came out, but even then, the video to 'Another Brick in the Wall' made a deep impression on me (it was number 1 in the charts at the time). I remember it being actually quite frightening and, at the time, the weirdest thing I'd ever seen on British TV.<br />I've since listened to the album an awful lot and seen the movie, and I have a much better understanding now of why it's so weird. Roger Waters is clearly an angry man, and doesn't hold his bitterness back. And why should he? I always think the best songs are those that are the most honest, and these ones are clearly written from the heart - admittedly a fairly dark one. The childhood anguish and resentment of having lost your father in what you perceive to be a pointless war is a dominant theme, and when this is set against a backdrop of unhappy, (and lonely?) schooldays at the hands of vicious, dictatorial teachers, don't expect to be dancing to this album in your local disco. Having said that, there is some deliciously black humour in some of the songs (especially Waiting for the Worms and The Trial). <br />This is generally considered to be one of the first, if not the first, concept albums, and Pink Floyd deserve credit for having the bravery to do it. They went out on quite a limb, and it could very easily have been ridiculed as a bloated extravagance. The musical score is incredibly ambitious, but I think it represents a real strength of the album. The songs are incredibly varied, I genuinely can't think of any other album that contains slow piano-based songs (e.g. Nobody Home), soaring guitar solos (e.g. Comfortably Numb), thumping stadium rock (e.g. Another Brick Part 3, Run Like Hell), theatricals (the Trial, Waiting for the Worms) and practically whispered poems (One of My Turns intro). <br />The lyrics themselves are also remarkably wide-ranging, representing anger (e.g. Mother, Another Brick), seedy seduction (Young Lust), plaintive sadness (Nobody Home, Vera), creepy (Anybody Out There?), childhood reflection (Comfortably Numb) and just plain weirdness (In the Flesh). Some of the songs are just so well-written they are profoundly moving - try listening to Nobody Home while sitting in a comfortable chair with the lights off and you will see what I mean.<br />The lyrics and music are so finely matched that I really consider this album to be a work of genius. I just love the richness and depth of the vocals in songs like Mother and Nobody Home, and the album is liberally scattered with neat vocal tricks and effects that fit in so well (e.g. the voice through the loudhailer in Waiting for the Worms, the sniggering laughs that appear in several songs). The backing vocals/switching between singers is also very professional.<br />Be warned that you may not like this album the first time you listen to it, but it definitely grows on you, even to the point that you appreciate it in its entirety rather than just dipping into a song here and there.<br />In sum, I heartily recommend this outstanding album to anyone who has an appreciation of *real* music (i.e. more than 3 chords, the use of some great words, limited use of the words 'love' and 'baby', and no delimitation of songs into verse, chorus, verse, chorus ad nauseum).<br />I am desperately sorry for Roger Waters that he had such an awful childhood, but, without wanting to sound superficial or insensitive, I sincerely hope that writing this superb album helped him in some way. Thank You Roger and Pink Floyd.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love bring me to live! It is the best song eva! i was watching black sash and it had bring me to live playing while ali and tori were fighting some guy who tried to abuse them. and it sounded so cool with the action scene. i also like the second song- don't know what its called though. i love the beginning when she says \\"Perfect By A Nature\\"- touching words. you so want to buy this, im glad i did!
B000007MVL|5.0|It really does matter which version of the album you have.  I recently acquired an version found in her box set and I notice a marked increase in quality.  But i've never thought that the sound of the American edition was that lacking.  You just have to listen harder.  ;)
B000002LFL|5.0|I especially love the live renditions of Cemetery Gate, and Big Mouth, much more so than the studio album versions, although I like all of the songs selected on this album. They are to me a really balanced selection of the Smith's styles.  The album versions seem a bit, well, studio-like and restrained. Performed live, the songs take on an added essentiallness, drive, and verve.  I like listening to the album in its entirety, very loudly or through headphones and each time I am transported to a magical experience. I know the other reviewers have mentioned that this album was a &quot;filler&quot; release after the Smiths broke up but to me this album really exhibits the essential beauty of Morrisey's emotional-laden songs and Johnny Marr's melodicism. By the way, if you like Morrissey's solo work, I recently bought &quot;Maladjusted&quot; and I must say it's a GREAT work!
0844663662|5.0|I'm no literary critic by any means but to me this is a great book.  In some way that I cannot describe in words Mr. Vonnegut tells his story and conveys his message by not taking a direct approach.  On one side it is a story of WWII POWs, and on the other it is a science-fiction story of one man's unusually bland life.  It is a must read book.
B000002MNL|5.0|Great album for all the reasons mentioned by others. &quot;Maladjusted&quot; is another great MOZ album, which I've commented on in much greater detail because I think it needs much more positive exposure.  This album is an no-brainer great piece of work but please please please give &quot;Maladjusted&quot; a spin.
1563890119|2.0|I bought this one because i've read one Gaiman before (American Gods) and i though it was fabulous...<br />I only had been exposed to american comics before only through some old, translated, x-men comics which i figured where for kids. I was expecting a much higher quality for the graphics. <br />The storys good, but i'd rather read a book if the visual are not the main attraction in a comic. I also bought neverwhere at the same time, and still think that Gaiman is a great author.
B00000K19E|3.0|I thought this film was just plain silly. I couldn't take it seriously. And that ridiculous shiny black leather thing they had going ruined it for me. I hated the lead female character. Some of her moves were the most embarrassingly ridiculous in the whole film, like that stupid praying mantis slow-mo kung fu move at the beginning, and the equally stupid slow-mo sideways wall running scene near the end. Reeves acting was wooden as always, he obviously only gets parts due to his looks and athletic physique, and I've never been crazy about Fishburne. As far as I'm concerned Fishburne's most convincing part was as a NY mugger in Death Wish. But Agent Smith was great, and the guy who played the 'betrayer', i think he was called Cypher, he was great as well. Special effects were good, and the music was good. In short, entertaining but silly. Oh yeah, one last thing, I was glad when that albino blondie chick in the shiny WHITE leather gear got killed.
B000092ZYX|4.0|If you like music too hastily, chances are great that it is nothing more than ear candy, and that rots your mind.  You should like it, but there should be an aspect of something missing in a very present manner; something that makes you uncomfortable in a comforting way. It's complex, and it has to try to give you one.  It's the absence of relief; hail to the thief...So,in this way there is always HOPE.<br />(Radiohead won't ever rot your mind; no matter how hard it tries.)
B00008WT49|5.0|I doubt that too many folks reading this review haven't heard the smooth, melodic voice of Norah Jones, so I won't spend any time describing it to you.  However, you haven't heard the best that Norah Jones has to offer until you've heard her on SACD! <br />For starters the quality of the SACD version of the album is apparent even when played on a conventional CD player.  The SACD just seems to contain more audible information...there are subtleties that I notice on the SACD that I didn't notice on the original CD release.  I'm not sure if this is due to the audio masters being transferred at a higher bit rate or if it is just due to slightly different mixing, but the results are welcomed!<br />If that isn't good enough then wait until you pop this little SACD jewel into a full-blown SACD 5.1 system - Wow!  The music envelops you, and on a few of the tracks you even feel as if Norah herself is giving you a private concert.  The effect is not overdone, just gratifying.  <br />The day that this SACD arrived in the mail I listened to it four times straight and never felt tired of listening nor did I want to switch to another disc.  Even the few tracks that I had sometimes skipped in the past while listening to the conventional CD were now more intriguing.  If you like the \\"Come Away With Me\\" CD then you will love the SACD that much more.  <br />Highly Recommended!!
0553579908|3.0|A Clash of Kings contains many of the elements that made A Game of Thrones so enjoyable to read; most notably the quality of its writing, the depth of its characters, and the plausibility of its dialogue.  However, while A Clash of Kings amplifies the epic quality of the series, so too does it amplify many of the more minor faults from A Game of Thrones.<br />Martin's mechanic of focusing on a different character in each chapter continues to entertain, but several of the plot threads remain as extraneous and dull as ever.  In a series that, so far, has concentrated on the battle between Lannisters, Baratheons, and Starks for the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms, the characters of Jon Snow, Dany, and Theon Greyjoy are of dubious value, particularly when more pertinent and engrossing characters such as Brienne, Varys, and Ser Rodrick remain underdeveloped.  True, A Clash of Kings is only the second book of a six-part series, but it is unreasonable to include so little plot convergence within over 1500 pages of material.  Dany's subplot, in particular, remains not only irrelevant, but also exasparatingly devoid of new developments, and her most intriguing chapter (a meeting with the warlocks' guild) is uncharacteristically muddled at best.<br />Some segments of A Clash of Kings display the same brilliance of A Game of Thrones.  The chapters involving Arya and Ser Davos Seaworth, in particular, are a joy to read.  However, Martin jettisons the methodical and logical plot progression found<BR>in most of the book in favor of bizarre and indulgent sequences at times.  This is particularly infuriating as regards Stannis' red priestess and Tyrion's late heroics.  As a result, A Clash of Kings consists of long intervals with no plot development interspersed with small segments in which the entire story is changed instantaneously.<br />Perhaps the book's greatest flaw is the ever-increasing despair attendant to the surviving characters of House Stark, who might be considered the story's protagonists.  I am not naive enough to expect comedy in the midst of warfare, but by the end of A Clash of Kings an overwhelming amount of tragedy has engulfed the Starks, often abruptly and without sufficient explanation.  Such prolonged hopelessness was certainly also utilized by Tolkien, but whereas the three books of the Lord of the Rings were released simultaneously and totalled approximately 1500 pages, The Song of Ice and Fire Series seems destined to exceed 4500 pages and a decade of production time.<br />A more minor problem with A Clash of Kings is the more frequent inclusion of explicit sexual situations.  Adult material is not necessarily inappropriate in many books, but Martin's use of such situations is both sporadic enough and graphical enough to appear gratuitous, while still causing me to be seriously reticent to recommend the series to an adolescent or even to my parents (doubtless they would be equally uncomfortable recommending it to me).<br />Therefore, while Martin's writing remains as technically flawless as ever, and while A Clash of Kings merits reading simply because the rest of the series is predicated upon it, the wonderfully engaging quality of A Game of Thrones is much rarer in a Clash of Kings.  The series must improve to warrant continued interest.
B0000640VN|3.0|A contemporary case of time travel lands the Duke Leopold of Albany (1870-era chivalrous dude) in Manhattan, 2001. He falls in love with Kate, and then the whole time issue becomes the question of, if this affair is to endure, which of them will make the switch, because it's clear that, well, to tell more would be to tell too much.<BR>A little hokey, a little silly, but it's fun enough for an evening at home.
6305308659|5.0|this movie was very enjoyable. Reese Witherspoon and Tobey McGuire (if that's how you spell his last name) work very well together as sister and brother. Paul Walker is very funny in this movie, playing Witherspoon's love intrest in Pleasantville. Pleasantville was a great movie revolving around the theme of Individuality VS Conformity. Individuality wins, as people in Pleasantville start becoming in color, as the people who still decided to conform stay black and white.
B000065U1N|4.0|That said, I love this film.  I'll be honest, I went to see this movie because I'm a huge Ewan McGregor fan, normally I would have let this movie pass me by.  I have never been more thankful I randomly chose to see a film in my life.  Black hawk Down is a raw, unshakeable movie, full of images that haunt me to this day.<br />So why four stars instead of five?  Mostly because I'm kicking myself that I didn't buy the extended edition DVD (but it's on my wish list).  More importantly because the first viewing of this film moved me and possessed me in a way no repeated viewing ever will.  Taken from the big screen and the dark close quarters of the theatre, and placed in my safe comfortable home, the movie loses its greatest asset, surprise.<br />There are some truely stellar performances in Black Hawk Down.  Including a small part by Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana (The Hulk) in a pivotal roll.  Josh Hartnett, who so many try to regulate to simple teen-dream status, but really can act, proves it once again here.  And Ewan McGregor, the one who brought me to this film?  Well, it's not his best work, that will forever be Trainspotting, but he holds his own.  Thankfully, though, he had a better voice coach for Down with Love, because his American accent is very off in Black Hawk Down.<br />So, even if you aren't a fan of war movies, even if you don't usually enjoy the gruesome, and movies that deal with uncomfortable subject matter aren't your cup of tea, see Black Hawk Down, at least once.  On the bigger the screen the better.
B00005B36H|5.0|I knew from the first time I heard Tool that they were going to be a band to invest money in. And man was I right! I'm not really into music if its not heavy or doesn't make me bang by head, BUT, this cd is VERY easy to get into, if you're patient. These songs are longer than older Tool songs, but I'm a patient guy. This cd is a MUST-BUY for almost anyone REMOTELY into rock music. Tool are themselves, though. Don't put them into any genre of music. Tool, keep it coming with some of the best and most beautiful music I've ever heard.
B00005MCX2|4.0|Got headphones?    To many people 'space rock' means the monotone drone of new age, HW is anything but that. They combined the sounds of Lemmy & Motorhead with the free form sax of Nick Turner. Long before the name was they were playing speed metal with the psychedelia of Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, etc.
B00003CXXI|4.0|Good movie, not the best, but worth watching anyhoo.
B00004Z459|4.0|When Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory hit the scene it blew me out of the water.  The first thing I noticed while listening to them on the radio was the lack of the normal censorship.  I bought their cd and was amazed to find there was no swear words.  I was very impressed with the fact that a hard rock/rap band could actually get their point across without swearing!  After all with all the other bands popular at the time (Limp Bizkit, Korn, ect) doing it it was only natural to assume that they were going to swear also.  <BR>Another thing that stood out was their sound.  It was totally different.  The way they included all the members of their band in almost every track was amazing.  I loved the way that the vocals and rapping just melded together.  Also their DJ sounded like he belonged with the band (unlike other bands with DJs who just either sound out of place or the rest of the band overpowers them and covers it up).  I also loved the DJs innovative beats and sound effects.<BR>The only gripe I have about this album is its length.  I could listen to the whole cd in the half hour drive to work! I guess the good thing was that I craved for more after my CD changer started to change over to the next CD in my car.  For those of you who have not heard Linkin Park or heard Meteora but not Hybrid Theory I highly recommend buying it.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm 16, and I am still developing a taste for music. When I first started listening to rock, i liked some bands and then months later I would find those certain bands, &quot;unappealing&quot;, so to speak. I've been a LedZep fan since the day I was born, I just didn't know it. I was 8 when I got this cd, and I still listen to it to this day. Songs like, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; are uptempo, no doubt you've heard these songs if you listen to classic rock. And then, for instance, you can switch to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and have a tear in your eye at the beginning, and towards the end of the song, you'll find yourself singing along, and rocking back and forth. This cd owns me. Get it. Just buy this cd, it will own you, too, NO DOUBT.
B00008H2LB|4.0|It seems to me that most hard rock/alternative rock artists are either going the shorter route or the &quot;softer&quot; (not as hard as their earlier releases) route.  Linkin Park's newest album is short yet has the potential to touch everyone in some personal way.  I love how they continued having one track lead into the next and how they continue to use the mix of rap and rock.  Linkin Park's sound is also still unique in their new album.  They use the right combination of bass, beat, sound effects, and rock.  I would recommend this album to anyone who liked, even remotely, their first album.  This album is just a continuation of the last and I can't wait to hear their next one.
B000002H6C|5.0|metallica might have lost a few fans on this cd, simply because they made their first video...for \\"one\\". Who cares though, if you were in their position, think of it, more money, and an oppurtunity to grab a bigger fan base. This is my favorite metalliac cd. its great, a cd whose lyrics seem like they belong to little anarchy bands. It doesn't matter. This cd is worth it. I  bought this cd used for $..., and i wore it out, and had to buy it new. go get it!
1400034779|5.0|I just can't say enough about the Number One Ladies' Detective Agency! In my own family my aunty, who had lived in Africa for several years, she first found this book and read it, and loved it. Then my mom read it and was crazy about it (and she's a retired librarian who reads a ton of novels). Next my sister, another librarian, read it and likewise was nuts about it too. My dad even read it, and he almost never reads any fiction at all....he was crazy about it also. My wife read it and is almost finished now with the next one from this exciting \\"new\\" author. I just finished it yesterday and knew I would have to review this book, would have to try and encourage others to read it.<br />  I think I'll read all of the books in the series, and I understand there are four of them.<br />  Botswana. I confess I didn't know much of anything about it before this book, but here Botswana comes alive, becomes completely real. The heroine of these books, the big, fat, smart, really wonderful character Precious Ramotswe, she is just too clever and fun. One little mystery after another unfolds here, each of them totally absorbing. I read the occasional mystery, but this one is easily my favorite.<br />  I'm a writer myself (Safe Sex in the Garden, Allergy-Free Gardening, etc.) and I so appreciate writing that is fresh, fun, inventive, imaginative, full of discovery and surprise, and this novel has it all. There were several parts in the book that made me cry too, not from sadness, but from pure joy. A simply marvelous book. If a book ever did completely deserve five stars, this is the one. Treat yourself to a copy and you won't be able to put it down. When you finish it, give it to someone who doesn't read much, and I expect that this one they'll not only finish, but they'll love it too. A rare find; a simply terrific book!
B00000099Y|5.0|This cd, in my eyes, is the heaviest of the 5 they have released. Tool is a little underrated. In 15 or 20 years people will look back on Tool and say, &quot;God, they were REALLY good&quot;. In 20 years people won't be listening to Eminem, or Slipknot, they'll be listening to Tool. This cd is a great reason why this is true. Do not think twice about purchasing this album. Buy it now.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I like this CD.  I really do.  But some of the songs I just have to skip over... I loved &quot;No Such Thing&quot; the first billion times I heard it on the radio, and I still do like it, but it is overplayed.  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; is a wonderful song, I think, love the lyrics &quot;...in the kind of morning that lasts all afternoon, just stuck inside the gloom&quot;.  I've had many of those kinds of days when you don't know what else to do with yourself.  &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; has some catchy lyrics too.  The guitar part of &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; are wonderful to listen to.  &quot;Neon&quot; is one of my personal favorites, I love the way it sounds different from the rest of the numbers.  &quot;City Love&quot; is boring, in my opinion, I skip over it.  &quot;83&quot; is cute, I think, not a favorite.  I absolutely love &quot;3x5&quot; just because of the lyrics... it doesn't necessarily have to do with losing someone you love.  In fact, I wrote a short story based on the ideas in this song.  &quot;Love Song For No One&quot; is by no means original but I like the musical part of it anyway.  &quot;Back To You&quot;~ I skipped over it mostly, but once I did decide to listen to it I found it was to my liking.  &quot;Great Indoors&quot; I don't like at all.  I don't have anything good to say about that song... kind of a dumb topic too.  &quot;Not Myself&quot; is surely one of my favorites, just because of the music.  I don't like &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; at all, it is even more boring than &quot;City Love.&quot;<br />But that's the great thing about CDs, you can skip over the ones you don't like and get right to the ones you do.  This is one of those CDs, like most, that the songs that aren't played on the radio are some of the better ones.  This is a definite must-buy.
6305291446|3.0|This was definetly my least favorite of all the Halloween movies.<BR>The only good thing about it was that Jamie Lee Curtis returned.<BR>I didn't like the fact that they totally disregarded the last two movies. Although Jamie Lee does talk about how she faked her own death, she never mentions the fact that she has a daughter (who appeared in Halloween 4 & 5.)I was also bothered by the fact that the movie was not set in Haddonfield, it just wasn't the same. It was like taking Jason out of Camp Crystal Lake. The movie almost seemed like an excuse to find roles for the up-and comer teens which where very hot at the moment. I also had a serious problem with the guy they cast as Michael Myers. Gimme a break! First of all, he was way to short, he walked like a duck, and YOU COULD SEE HIS BIG BLUE EYES! Michael's eye are supposed to be black! Also,the mask was totally wrong. The scariest mask they used was in The Curse Of Michael Myers. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the fact that they did keep it going by making another movie. If I wasn't a die hard Halloween fan, I probably would have enjoyed this movie alot more, but there was just too many things wrong about it. I didn't fit in with any of the other movies in the series. They should have gone back to the end of Halloween 5 and started again.
B00008LDPU|1.0|This is a series of 9 shorts each of which is,unfortunately, too long,too predictible and too boring. Necrotic. Plus, the interface stinks and you have the pleasure of seeing all nine sets of credits at the end of each individual short.<br />This is one star because reviewers can't give zero stars!<br />Don't buy this. Don't rent this. Don't ever bother yourself with this.

B00005JM09|5.0|.....they, will Rise.......<br />Arnold is back in one of two of his most popular roles to date, (the other is Conan) and he's back to save the world, or rather, save 2003. After a string of disappointments this year, namely Matrix Reloaded and Hulk, Terminator 3 is the only saving grace of the summer, and boy let me tell you, it's TRUE! IT'S DAMN TRUE!<br />The action comes thick and fast with utterly amazing visual effects, but beside all that, there is an emotional story beneath the eye candy, a story which beats a strong heartbeat about an young man carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. What does the Future hold for John Connor? Will he continue to be a nobody all his life, or will he face up to his destiny, ultimately, the dark future in which Mankind VS Machines in a war of hell.<br />The rest of the cast besides Arnold measure up extremely well. Nick Stahl is incredible as John Connor, a man of emotional torment, constantly wondering what the Future has in store for him. Claire Danes is as wonderful as ever as Katherine Brewster, a woman who also shares a destiny of unknown, but besides all this, there is the T-X!<br />The T-X, played menacingly by Kristanna Loken, is probably one of the best villains in the last decade. Conveying a sense of innocence and playful flirting which the T-X has learnt, she quickly snaps back into the cold stare of the Terminator, and we are immediately reminded of the suspense riveting experience of when we all first the T-1000 in 1991. I shouldn't make comparisons, but I am going out on a limb here to say she definately rivals Robert Patrick's performance from T2. She young, sexy, but ultimately what we all wanted, a villain we are terrified by.<br />The genius Stan Winston returns to do animatronics and make-up effects, while the best in the business ILM return once more to provide the most jaw-dropping CGI special-effects we've ever seen in film. The trademark Future War sequences of the Terminator movies play a much important role this time around, as the Future is closely linked more to the present time story, unlike T2, which was merely just eye-candy at the start.<br />I feel I have missed something out here, and now is the time to get to it - Jonathan Mostow. The director who steps into the shoes of James Cameron, and boy, he fits perfectly! Jonathan has not only made a movie which stands proudly alongside the previous Terminator films, but he's added something new and fresh, and ultimately made it his own. Sure, it contains the same ingrediants as the previous two, but Jonathan mixes them into his own style, and creates a nerve-wracking suspencful ride of humour, sadness and menace. Mostow has taken excellent care of the third chapter which feels like he's breathed new life into the aging franchise, kick started it's heart beat once more. <br />So to all you skeptical-Cameron fans out there - get over it. I was skeptical at the start of production, but as time went by, I realised how much of a man Jonathan really is. He's a superb director, with such a huge eye for detail, a man in his own league, but ultimately, what he's done with T3 is allowed the story to be the star of the show, and it's an extremely strong story, showing what really happened, the first conflict between humans and machines. That emotional human feeling of the first two movies is carried on over to T3, and is more stronger than ever. I found the movie to be emotionally draining at times, borderline on tears!<br />I'm happy to say that T3 works flawlessly, and stands extremely well alongside the previous two in the series. It extends and expands the story to much broader levels whilst adding new touches and sealing any plot-holes which were created in the first two films.<br />As far as I am concerned, true Terminator fans and moviegoers will lap this movie up. To T3-bashers/Cameron fans, you truly don't deserve to see this work of Art. Your years of torment and hatred for this movie is pathetic, andlook what's happened, your narrow minded minds have been proved wrong, but I doubt your egos would allow you to admit it.<br />For the final statement - this is the movie I've been wanting to see ever since the closing credits of 1991. I was concerned this movie wouldn't live up the hype of 12 years, and given my high expectations, it exceeded them.<br />My hats off to you Jonathan Mostow. You didn't screw this movie up, no, you've created something which stands alongside as a trilogy of the Terminator movies, and Arnold needs no explanation, he's back, hugely wripped and muscled out as much as he was 12 years ago, or even 20 years ago. The man looks fantastic for his age, and the differences are extremely hard to spot from a comparison from his 1991 look. Now, all we need is KING CONAN, I AM LEGEND and CRUSADE to be made by the big man. Come on Warner Bros, greenlight these projects now! T3 is destined to bring in the big bucks. Use those earnings to fund these further three Arnold projects NOW!<br />Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines is the MOVIE OF 2003!
B00000K0EA|5.0|Out of Brosnan's Bond movies (Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Die Another Day) this one is the best overall. Everything about this movie is very well done and is worthy to be part of this great series. The soundtrack by David Arnold is a huge step up from Eric Serra. From start to finish this movie was filled with intrigue that showed the character Bond doing a lot of spy work which reminded us what his job is other than pleasing women. The use of the media as an enemy is extremely plausable today and added a sense of real life to the movie. Brosnan is also more comfortable in the role, one of the best bonds I would say under Connery.<BR>Personally I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you have never seen any Bond movie. Acting, locations, script, soundtrack, direction and the overall story make me rate this movie 5 stars.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Being the first White Stripes album I buy, but having heard White Blood Cells, I can honestly say that the second one is better. But not THAT better. Elephant is one of the releases of the year simply because of the consistency of a great bunch of songs: Seven Nation Army has classic written all over it, as There's not home for you here, You've got her in your pocket or I don't know what to do with myself. Unfortunately the tracklisting department fails considerably: all of the previously mentioned songs, along with other great tunes such as Black math, or Ball and biscuit, are all put together in the first half of the record. Hence, the second part of the cd is good but doesn't shine whatsoever. White Blood Cells is brilliant from start to end. I would buy this record first, because it's amazing, and then, when I think no group can have another great cd, I'd buy White... and die of happiness.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors debut album is their best.  Their well known singles like &quot;Break on Through&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire&quot; are excellent and the rest of the songs maintain the same quality.  &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; is an beautiful piece of poetry, performed perfectly by Jim Morrison's haunting voice.  &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; are also lyrically clever and surprisingly catchy. <BR>&quot;Back Door Man&quot; is a rousing blues number, likely the weakest track on the album, but still worth listening to.  &quot;I Looked at you&quot; and &quot;Take it as it Comes&quot; are both energetic songs, surrounding the hypnotic &quot;End of the Night&quot;.  The final track is &quot;The End&quot;, a near-masterpiece drawing influences from the Greek Tradgedy of Oedepis.  <BR>The Doors, and in particular Jim Morrison, are the only people capable of pulling of this album.  If you have any interest in the Doors check this out.  It's worth every penny.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|this was an cool movie about vampires. me being the horror fan i am rented this with high expectations. it met them and then some. i loved this tottally. okay so heres to the plot. blade is half man half vampire and tottally rad superhero fighting another team of bad vampires and it allk adds up in the end thanks to the pervasive gore anjd extremely strong violence with a techno soundtrack.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Why can't all live albums from the early 70's sound this good? When these concerts were performed the Zeps were still having fun and could still care about performing the fan favorites from the first four albums. But Robert Plant live has never fared well in comparison with his recorded voice. Granted he has to save his voice not only for the entire concert but the entire tour. Still, Since I've Been Loving You and Black Dog live remain disappointing. But Page, Jones and Bonham do everything to justify the legend.

B00005JLEU|5.0|'Spirited Away' was the first Miyazaki film I had ever seen so, in a positve sense, I had none of his past work with which to compare it or to influence my opinion. It was recommended by a friend who is a fan of some of Miyazaki's films and also by the numerous radiant reviews I had seen in this latest film's regard. I was not disappointed. Immediately, without any preconceived notions derived from Miyazaki's prior works, I was captured by the sense of wonder evoked by Miyzaki-san's truly elegant and unique approach to animation. The motifs present in every frame, the peripheral details in his frames that really are *not* so peripheral, the simplicity yet relevance of his modern characters -- all of these things made for instant interest, and then outright enchantment. Miyazaki proved himself a maestro, a deft conductor of a well-assembled orchestra from the very first moments. Music, exceptional use of color, brooding angles, and restrained dialogue strike a simultaneous chord of melancholy from the first moments we glimpse the dilemma of Chihiro in the back-seat of the car as her family is obviously in \\"transition.\\" Every sight and sound is calculated with care and delicacy as the story moves quickly to the point where the family's \\"off-the-beaten-path\\" detour takes them to a mysterious but beguling sanctuary (of sorts) in the middle of a woodland. There, Chihiro's parents decide to have a carefree look around the lonely ruins, while the child-figure, Chihiro, senses trouble immediately. This establishes a powerful foundation for what I perceive to be Miyazaki-san's overall theme -- the Child, without guile or guide, often has the best instincts...despite having the least power, choice, or control with which to act upon those instincts.<br />   Chihiro relcutantly follows her parents into what appears to be a crumbling, abandoned theme-park. The eerie, lonely tones continue until the motif of delicious FOOD is planted smack-dab in the middle of the plot. The toneschange, for the glorious, freshly-made \\"feast\\" brings both a sense of satisfaction and familiarity that plays nicely around the child's persistent apprehensions and the viewer's niggling sense that something simply CAN'T be right in this desolate landscape.<br />   What happens after Chihiro's parents dismiss her misgivings and settle down for a gluttonous meal is nothing less than a rip-roaring, non-stop explosion of magic, color, danger, mayhem, surprise, haunting imagery, and all-out bizarre (but morally \\"thematically\\" realistic) animation. The \\"abandoned theme park\\" turns out to be a \\"Bath-house\\" for the ancient Gods and Spirits of Japan -- abandoned by light of day, but magically transmogrified by night into an alternative universe where these spirits come to refresh themselves in ways that are at once human and decidedly immortal. <br />   The whole place is \\"managed\\" by a jaded and crabby old sorceress named \\"Zeniba\\" -- a character who must be seen to be believed, and both her clientele and her slave-driven employees never fail to disappoint the viewer's senses. There are a GREAT number of derivative qualities to Miyazaki-san's overall work -- shades of the Wizard of Oz,Alice in Wonderland, Never-Ending Story, Beauty and the Beast, and even an obscure Godzilla film make their influences known-- but these thematic borrowings and motifs serve the universal quality of the story with a very functional integrity. Even more poignant is the subtle sadness with which Miyazaki notes that the Japanese are fast trading the magic and mythical tradition of their ancient culture, in its entirety, for the irrepressible gift of Modernity.<br />   There's a love story here (or rather, a story about the primacy of love), and the truly empowering theme of a moody, spoiled little girl who is suddenly thrust into the madness of REAL magic and who must find a way to rise above her immaturity to save herself, her parents, and the balance of the seen and unseen worlds, is very inspiring. Essentially, Miyazaki-san is telling us how adaptable we are to frightening, frantic change in this world...and how adaptable we must be in order to survive. The fact that this lesson is learned best in his story by a *child* opens the door to many serious  questions about what our modern cultures are now demanding of the very young.<br />   These underlying brushstrokes aside, the whole film is a work of brilliance on the part of Mayazaki-san and his animators. The American dubbing is impeccable -- particularly Suzanne Pleshete as Zeniba and her \\"alter ego.\\" The sight, story, and fate of the \\"Stink Spirit\\" alone is worth the purchase of this DVD. 'Spirited Away' is definitely an adult film in that it will appeal to fans of *anime* and will thrill the sensible adult mind as effortlessly as it will captivate the child, but some of the calibrated images are spooky and indelible; kids under six will have a couple of toss-and-turn nights, perhaps, after watching the film. Overall, though, this is a goldmine for the entire family, the ageless and proverbial young-at-heart, and one of the best Japanese films to emerge in recent years -- as evidenced by its big box office in Japan and in American art-house venues. The extras on the disc are notable for the original Japanese dub and moreso for the documentary of how Miyazaki literally \\"hand-crafted\\" this film the old fashioned way and emerged with a jewel that is every bit as breath-taking and eye-catching as the digital creations being churned out by contemporaneous production companies. Four and a Half Shooting Stars and kudos to Miyazaki-san. The half-star is detracted only because themes  are just a mite too OBVIOUSLY derivative -- but just a mite. This one's a keeper. Buy it and treasure it.
B000002HJR|5.0|Personally, I like &quot;Down II&quot; more, but this is just as effective. Once again, killer riffs, vox,... killer SONGS! You can see how every member has grown as a musician from this to II, but you can't have one without the other.
B00009V7T2|3.0|I love and will always love At The Drive In, the best. They had something going that no one could even come close to. Go out and buy this cd if you are a fan, it great. It seems to me that at some point their(MARS VOLTA) new sound was ground breaking in there EP, but in their new album it seems to repetetive, to me, with all the same distortion, track to track. Beleive me i love this way better than SPARTA but its lacking something, I dont know what. Maybe its the energy i get from listning to ATDI records that pumps me up? Still a great album, but not what i anticipated from Cedric. But after listening to their Ep I guess it's expected because of the direction the band was going in the EP. I guess, I got to let go of that high intensity that was once know as AT THE DRIVE IN. Rip.
B000002G87|5.0|This is the best record I've ever heard. From the perfect track placement to the great jams and solos from both Duane Allman and Clapton. All the songs are masterpieces especially the title track and the crazy jams on &quot;Have you ever loved a woman?&quot; and &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;. Not only a great jam record, but of course an awesome overall rock/blues recording. Buy anything u can get a hold of by these guys, but good luck, they weren't together so long, too bad. :(-
B000002I8D|5.0|1981's &quot;Face Value&quot; was Phil Collins' very first solo album, and it still remains his best. Any detractors that Phil has who only know him from his huge &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; period in the mid-80's have obviously---and shamefully---overlooked this outstanding album. &quot;Face Value&quot; came about due to the painful divorce from his first wife that Phil was going through at the time. Although Phil had chipped in here &amp; there in co-writing some of the material with his band Genesis, it was his divorce that opened up his songwriting floodgates, as he found himself writing more &amp; more material on his own than ever before. But the bulk of Phil's new songs were extremely personal, mostly directed towards his ex-wife, and Genesis only recorded two of them: &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Ask,&quot; both of which were featured on the band's 1980 release, &quot;Duke.&quot; Phil kept the rest of his songs for his first solo album, and &quot;Face Value&quot; was born, launching Phil's very-successful solo career (though he would continue to record and tour with Genesis through 1992).Considering the personal nature of the album, &quot;Face Value&quot; contains some of Phil's strongest material ever. The spooky Top 20 hit, &quot;In The Air Tonight,&quot; is without a doubt Phil's signature song, with it's slow, quiet build-up, atmospheric air, obscure lyrics (even Phil says he doesn't know what they mean), Phil's haunting vocals, and finally, that legendary, slamming drum fill towards the end as only Phil can do it. I dare you NOT to reach over and turn up the volume upon hearing it! But there are many other great songs on the album: the warm, laid-back pop of &quot;This Must Be Love&quot; (featuring Stephen Bishop on backing vocals), Phil's jazzy re-arrangement of the Genesis song, &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; (complete with horn section), the lovely, simple but effective &quot;The Roof Is Leaking&quot; (a very underrated Phil gem, and much different from his other stuff), and a powerful pair of back-to-back instrumentals, the dark, atmospheric &quot;Droned,&quot; and, in contrast, the exuberantly happy &quot;Hand In Hand,&quot; a Phil concert staple to this day. Other highlights include &quot;I Missed Again,&quot; another Top 20 hit for Phil and a terrific toe-tapping tune, the emotional, heartfelt ballads &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot; and &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy,&quot; and finally, a thunderous remake of the Beatles classic, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; slowed down a bit in tempo but no less powerful. But even then Phil isn't quite finished yet, because, as &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; finally fades away, Phil quietly sings the first few words of &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot; (a statement about his emotional feelings at the time, perhaps?), ending the album on a very memorable note. With &quot;Face Value,&quot; Phil Collins bravely wore his heart on his sleeve and recorded one of the very best debut solo albums by any artist. His heartfelt singing and songwriting on the album, plus his superb playing and production work, easily make &quot;Face Value&quot; his solo masterpiece. Although I enjoy all of Phil's great solo work, including his latest release, &quot;Testify,&quot; &quot;Face Value&quot; captures Phil at the peak of his powers as a solo artist, both creatively and emotionally. &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; is certainly a fun album, but &quot;Face Value&quot; is a fantastic one.
B000005IU2|5.0|I have had this record for a long time now and I really thought it was quite bad for a good period of time when compared to Raw Power.  It turns out that I was entirely wrong and that Fun House may even be the Stooges best album.  It is absolute insanity from beginning till end and even if most of the songs sound similar at the start with an incoming riff and drum beat and Iggy howling it doesn't really matter.  The songs are all so excellent in their quality even if their isn't much to them when you seperate each part.  This is just a band that knew how to play and knew how to write amazing songs without much technical skill.  It's just a rock and roll album that everyone should understand.  What is even more amazing is that album is still ahead of it's time and even though there are definitely better albums out there I really think this is one of the classics.  Easily in the top 100 albums of all time and probably in my personal top 20.  Simply amazing.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Let me first say that if you have not yet seen \\"Mulholland Drive\\", then by golly PLEASE stop reading these or any other reviews!!  There are spoilers all throughout, and they could severely hamper the rare filmgoing experience to be had while watching this film.  I for one knew absolutely NOTHING about the story, and I experienced one of the rarest treats in my 20 some years of avidly watching movies.  This film has helped restore my faith in modern filmmaking.  Not to mention it finally did what I thought would never happen:  I became a David Lynch fan.  I personally did not like \\"Blue Velvet\\" when I finally saw it a few years ago (though I now know that I must see it again).  And I did not at all like \\"Wild At Heart\\" when I saw that about 11 years ago.  I thought this guy obviously possessed a unique filmmaking vision, but I simply didn't get it.  I'm really not even sure why I gave \\"Mulholland Drive\\" a try.  I think part of it had to do with having seen Naomi Watts in \\"The Ring\\".  Not that I fell in love with her or anything, I just found her interesting to watch in that movie.  But let me say that I also walked away from this movie as a fan of Naomi Watts.  She is simply smashing in this movie, tackling a most difficult role that I'm sure not many young actresses in Hollywood could pull off (though I saw in the cast bios that she's been in movies since 1986).  <br />So with all of that said, I don't want to say anything about the story.  Nothing at all.  Other than just stick with it.  It works itself out, but you will have to see the movie at least one more time and you'll need to think about it.  Be prepared to put aside at least six hours.  And be sure to read the ten clues on the DVD insert card, BUT don't read them until you've watched it once.  If you still don't get it, then come back here and read some of the reviews by the few people that got it and wrote about it.  Just know that while not exactly everything in the story is relevant to the core plot, part of the great pleasure is sorting out what does fit and what are simply red herrings.  <br />You'll be glad you gave this one a try.  But be ready to actively participate.  If you just sit back and let the images fly by you, then you will miss out on a rare opportunity to be sucked into a movie that will do to you what very few films can.  One critic was right when s/he said \\"it gets in your head and stays there\\".  This kind of thing has never really happened to me as an adult.  Or maybe I'm just regressing to my teenage years and I'm acting like a kid.  Who knows; I just know that I LOVED this movie.  And I am a very demanding customer.  <br />It's got to be the best film made since 1980.  I mark that as the year that Hollywood filmmaking exited its final golden era.  And the two films that mark that exit for me are \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\".  I'm not saying that movies got worse.  Our pop culture in general somehow changed at that time and became more commercial, something that we still feel in a much bigger way today.  <br />But on the down side, I must say the DVD itself is disappointing.  There's no reason a 2001 film should come with no extras.  It's not like they have to dig through the vaults to find bonus materials.  And what's funnier, I personally never care about chapters on a DVD, but for the first time I could have really used them here--but David Lynch didn't want it released that way.  How ironic for me.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When sparta came out with wiretap scars, i thought that it was one of the best albums of 2002. i had not yet heard anything from TMV, so i was interested to see the sparta counterpart. Upon purchasing this album last night, i can already say that this is the best record of 2003, thus far. <BR>it is a sonically intense, melodic, thought provoking and at times abstract look into what music can be. If you were at all a fan of ATDI, this album is a must. It's relationship of command times 10, if it hooked up with pink floyd's darkside of the moon. it would be pointless to review this album track by track- it is an album, and as such treats the listener best as a whole. there are things done with the multi-layered guitars very seldom heard elsewhere; and the vocals are equally strong. Their drummer recently passed on, due to an overdose- which is a true shame, because the drumwork exhibited on this album rivals jimmy chamberlain at his pinnacle with the smashing pumpkins.<BR>flat out, the best album released this year, and actually in quite some time. and you can get the album pretty cheap; most stores have it for some 'new-artist' discount price. <BR>and on top of the music, the cover booklet art (complete with reversable cover)  makes it worth the purchase price alone. check it out.

B0000042H4|5.0|I agree that Wotan is rather past his best. The voice is not as it used to be. But this ring is superb!! Birgit Nilsson is incomparable as Brunnhilde!! Nobody can compare with her. I have the Bohm Ring. Comparing the Solti Birgit Nilsson and the Bohm Birgit Nilsson, I can say that she is superb in both - unbeatable - no one can compete with her laser beam voice. As for which Birgit Nilsson is better, I think she is just astonishing in both and whichever one you get, you will not be disappointed. I can't stand reviewers who say that she is better in the Bohm Ring. I would say this. The Ring is a HUGE operatic masterpiece. It is impossible for any singer, especially the huge role of Brunnhilde to be 100% better in one version. In some parts, she is better in the Solti ring, in some parts, she is better in the Bohm ring. I dislike it when reviewers say that she sings better live. Birgit Nilsson declared that she prefers her Bohm interpretation. That is understandable. In the Bohm version, the orchestra is more in the background. So Birgit Nilsson is a degree clearer (in fact all singers are a degree clearer). In the Solti, the orchestra is very prominent and she is less \\"highlighted\\" because she has more orchestral sound to compete with. But honestly, when I compare sections of the 2 rings, she sounds just as splendid in both. The only difference is the balance - one with more ochestral sound, the other with less. So sometimes, it gives an illusion that she sings better in the Bohm version when in fact, she is just as good in Solti and in some instances, even better in the Solti version. <br />The advantage of the Solti is that you can hear all the orchestral details. In Bohm, the details are somewhat obscured. I first bought the Bohm version. So when I bought the Solti version, it was a revelation to me. Many details which I missed suddenly jumped forth at me. Having said that, there are sections in which the live version actually has the clearer orchestral detail (very very surprisingly). The one good example would be the famous Ride of Valkyries at the start of Walkure Act 3. Bohm balances the violins so that you actually feel that the Valkyries are riding in the air - there is a sense of being in the clouds and floating above the ground. The tempi is faster. The Solti on the other hand, emphasizes the brass to the detriment of the violin strings. It is exciting in its own way, no doubt. But the violins get drowned out somewhat by the brass so that you have less sense of floating in the air. In this passage, the Bohm is actually clearer in the orchestral detail simply because the Solti brass section was given too much prominence and drowning out the strings. Well, you can hear the strings but you need to concentrate somewhat whereas in the Bohm version, the strings jump out at you in this particular passage. Another example would be the string passage just before Brunnhilde's first entry in Walkure Act 2. the Bohnm version is nicer in conveying the flying through the air feeling. In Gotterdamerung, on the other hand, the Solti final immolation scene is more exciting. The orchestra is stunningly superb. So is Birgit Nilsson who sings with searing passion. The Bohm orchestra is somewhat less exciting here.<br />In a work as long as the Ring, there can hardly be one version which is superior to all others in all respect. It will always be the case that ecah recording has its strengths and weaknesses. I have the Bohm and Solti versions. Honestly, I can't decide which I like better - that's why I have BOTH. And I couldn't live without one or the other. But the Ring as it is is an expenseive investment. So if you press me to make a recommendation, here's what I will say to you - buy the Solti (the Solti was the second version I bought - I lived with the Bohm version only for quite sometime). <br />Here are the reasons that I recommend the Solti over the Bohm:<br />1. Orchestral details are clearer in the Solti version (with some exceptions as noted above). To enjoy the Ring, you must be able to hear the motifs clearly - the Siegfried motif, the Walkure motif, the Rhinemaiden motif. I realized after buying the Solti version that these motifs, though clear in the Bohm version did not leap out at me like it does in the Solti. Also the Vienna Philharmonic is gorgeous and superb. No matter how much one criticizes the Solti Ring, one thing is always irreproachable - the incomparable playing of the Vienna Philharmonic.<br />2. Birgit Nilsson is in both. So it makes not too much difference. She is searing in both versions. As I said, she is clearer in the Bohm version because the orchestra is less prominent. <br />3. Windgassen as Siegfried has the advantage of being in better voice in the Solti version since the Solti was under studio conditions and Windgassen was also younger. The Solti Siegfried was done in 1962 and Solti Gotterdammerung in 1964. Bohm was done in 1966. That is another reason for the Solti. <br />4. The third opera in the cycle Siegfried is better done then by Solti than Bohm. In general, Siegfried is somewhat \\"harder\\" to listen to because of the absence of female voices until the end when Brunnhilde wakes up. Solti's conducting is fabulous - he keeps things going -  the tempi never sags. In Solti's Walkure, the tempi sags sometimes. <br />5. Christa Ludwig as Fricka and Waltruate beats the Bohm Fricka and Waltraute hands down!! You perk up whenever Christa Ludwig comes in. That lady has the ability to capture a person's attention with her searing dramatic sense and beautiful voice.<br />6. I actually prefer Rysanek's Sieglinde than Crespin's. Rysanek is more thrilling especially above the stave. So I truly regret \\"giving up\\" Rysanek.<br />7. Theo Adam is in firmer voice than Hans Hotter. But Hans Hotter was THE Wotan for so many years. I think Hans Hotter does sound a little \\"woofy\\" as someone put it. But the singing is not bad at all. You are comparing Hotter with his older-self at the peak, of course you don't get singing as good as his older self. But the singing is still excellent - better than most can sing it. Anyway, decide for yourself.<br />8. Joan Sutherland is woodbird!!!!!<br />9. Stolze is a fabulous Mime. Slimy and digusting as he should be. Some people complain he exaggerates but I think it's a marvellous characterization. <br />10. Gootlob Frick is incredible as Hagen and Hunding. <br />So there you have it. If you can, BUY BOTH. Otherwise, I recommend the Solti for the reasons above.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilibrium is a film that I've wanted to see, ever since I saw the trailer. I saw the incredible fight sequences, the exceptional cinematography and the undelivable production design. When this film arrived on DVD I went and rented it right away and WOW!!! Equilibrium delivers on all those levels!!!<br />The movie is set in the future; where people are kept 'intact' by them taking doses of a new formula called Prozium. This formula keeps people from feeling any emotions whatsoever, because the government believes that human emotions get in the way of individuals, which causes the many intolerable violence and deaths in the world.<br />I have to start out by saying that the performance of Christian Bale is really something to see. He is very rigid and strong, which is why the film works. You get a sense of his pain of living life without feeling anything. Also, the supporting roles of Taye Diggs and Emily Watson is great. They add the right amount of attitude and completeness to the film which is great to see in this movie. The action sequences are EXCELLENT. With this new technique called 'Gun-Kata' adding a cool punch of using guns to fight in a way that is both beautiful but dangerous. I cannot say anything bad about this 'Gun-Kata' technique; It's really something to see for yourself.<br />With the positive aspects being said, there are some minor flaws in the film. There are some parts in the movie that are dialogue oriented, and some of them seem a bit too long. But, when the film is right on the action, it makes up for the time of the dialogue.<br />Overall, Equilibrium was a miss in the theatres, but go and give this movie a try and I guarantee that you'll be blown away.
0385335482|4.0|I'm not much of a fluff reader in general, and while it would be difficult to compare Confessions of a Shopaholic to works of great literature, it certainly is an enjoyable read. The author keeps the tone light and the story flowing, and the British touch was charming. I definitely could empathize with the main character as well. This book certainly works well for light entertainment - perhaps it won't be a classic, but it's definitely worth reading.
0440236738|4.0|Will Klein's mother, on her death bed, insists that Will's older brother, Ken, who had disappeared eleven years before after being charged in the murder of Will's ex-girl friend, is alive. Then the girl who Will expected to marry vanishes without a trace. Little does Will know that sorting out these two developments will be a highly intricate, fast_paced, and confusing journey. Will gets a lot of help from Squares, an ex-Nazi sympathizer, and now yoga guru and counselor for runaways.<br />The book is typical Coben. The action never bogs down and the plot twists are jolting. Is the story line completely plausible? Not really, but it is not totally absurd. Also, one could argue that the characters are not as compelling or as interesting as those in the Myron Bolitar series.<br />Basically, the book is a great read. I'm looking forward to Coben's latest, _no second chance_.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah's 1997 set Butterfly had a lot riding on it. Her first album since her divorce from Sony CEO Tommy Mottola, and especially since this was the follow-up to 1995's monster Daydream (which in turn followed her most successful, Music Box), there was the obvious question of repeating the same punch as the previous two releases. Of course, this is Mariah Carey, so unsurprisingly Butterfly debuted straight to No. 1 with the Puff Daddy-produced hit \\"Honey\\" riding at the top of the charts (yet another of 15 singles to hit the peak), but the mostly down-tempo set and heavier urban influence marked an evolving sound for Carey. With the exception of \\"Honey\\" and the slinky \\"Babydoll\\" (and perhaps the rhythm-heavy \\"The Roof\\"), Butterfly is not something one should play when expecting to bounce off the walls at a club. The major highlight is the additional No. 1 hit \\"My All\\", a stunning Latin-style ballad accompanied with little more than acoustic guitars, bongos, drum machine, and a muted string segment at the song's closing. Carey's vocal is more reserved on this track than usual, but the simple and sparse arrangements allow heavier focus on her voice and the yearning lyrics, making \\"My All\\" a classic `90s smash and one of the best pop/R&amp;B ballads of the modern era. More often than not, the overall slower mood normally dampens a record, but the heavier fixation on urban R&amp;B and simply because Carey ignites such power and heart-tugging emotion with her still unrivaled five-octave pipes makes Butterfly shine and is undoubtedly her most profound and touching collection yet.
B00005JMC6|5.0|&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is one of the best movies this year, and probably will be remembered as such at the end of 2003. It's full of haunting imagery, thought-provoking handling of universal themes, and family conflict. And there's a bit of the awe-inspiring and magical near the end as well.<br />When Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) was born, her mother and twin brother died. Her heartbroken father fled to Europe, leaving her in the care of her rigidly traditional grandfather Koro (Rawiri Paratene). Years later, Pai longs for her grandfather's approval, but he secretly blames her for the troubles plaguing the Maori -- especially since there is now no heir, as girls can't lead. Koro, we're told, wants a savior for the Maori tribe of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti. Now Koro begins training young boys in how to be chiefs, and Pai secretly learns as well (against Koro's orders).<br />When the final test of the boys fails completely, the heartbroken Koro calls out to the Ancient Ones (whales), one of which, according to legend, brought the first person to New Zealand. But they don't come for the old chief. Pai calls them as well -- only to bring disaster when the whales beach themselves near her home. To save the Ancient Ones, an old teacher must learn to break traditions, and a young one learns her true place.<br />Though the lead of this movie is a child, there is no cuteness, no dumbness, no talking-down. The moviemakers clearly respect the cast, the people it represents, and the wealth of legend and myth behind them. It feels so real that you could reach through and touch them. But the content in it is universal -- sometimes traditions should bow to what is needed, and they need to change for the people who honor them to survive.<br />Neither Pai nor Koro will leave you untouched; Pai hurts Koro by breaking the rules, while he hurts her by treating her as unworthy. The scene where she makes a speech praising him and their culture is heartbreaking, as she struggles to speak through her tears. Similarly, the moment when Koro realizes that he was wrong about Pai is amazing. This careful attention to the characterization shows the care that went into &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;<br />Direction is outstanding -- simple lines have great weight, dialogue is entirely believable, and the scenes are often carried just by the look on the actors' faces. There's a feeling of purity to the way it's directed, a freshness and beauty that shows in full near the finale. New Zealand is shown off at its best in wide scenic shots. And the climactic scene with the whales is nothing short of brilliant -- it will take your breath away.<br />Keisha Castle-Hughes is absolutely priceless; she has genuine talent, rather than the hamminess or woodenness that many young actors have. Rawiri Paratene is excellent as a man with a heavy burden who is getting more and more desperate; you won't like all he does, but he's an incredibly sympathetic character just the same. The supporting cast is also amazing, including Vicki Haughton as Pai's strong-willed grandmother and Cliff Curtis as her dad.<br />With remarkable performances, a simple, powerful message, and a brilliant storyline, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a film that should be seen again and again.ugh her tears.

B000002O1Q|5.0|Here's my advice: Buy this CD. Put this CD into your CD player. Skip to track 6. Turn off the lights. Experience &quot;Tonight is What it Means to Young&quot;. (It's best if you have surround sound as well).  It's the kind of song you don't merely listen to, you &quot;experience&quot;. I am a hardcore Jim Steinman fan and this was one I bought solely to add to my collection.  I now don't know how I lived without &quot;Tonight is What it Means to be Young&quot;. I would have to say it has become one of my favorite songs. I can't fall asleep at night without having listened to it. Steinman is a genius, he truly is. I have to admit I bought this soundtrack, as I mentioned, because I am a Steinman fan. I actually bought the soundtrack to a movie I've never seen or heard of! But I have to say, after listening to it, I presume the DVD will be arriving in my mailbox soon! Both Steinman songs are awesome, I also like &quot;Never Be You&quot;, but they're all great. As another reviewer said, this is the kind of CD you can put on loop mode and listen to over and over again. Don't hestitate, you won't be disappointed!
B000088E6D|5.0|I bought the cd from a radio recomendation and was I pleasantly pleased.  I had to listen to it twice the first time!  His voice is so smooth, it made me all tingly!  I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes Frank Sinatra but better.  Great romantic songs too.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  I went on Amazon to read about what people thought about the CD, and was surprised to find out that more people are disappointed with the CD than enjoy it.   I decided to listen to the samples available, and they sounded good.  So I bought the CD, and was totally blown away.  It was better than I expected it to be.  Almost every song was great and enjoyable to listen to. My absolute favorites are American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid, and Mother and Father. This has got to be one of Madonna's best albums. Ignore the negative reviews and go buy American Life. You won't regret it.
B00005JLWN|4.0|... you get a diamond like this one, 'Equilibrium.'  Yeah, I know it borrows from Bradbury, Orwell, and the Wachowskis, but guess what?  NO STORIES ARE COMPLETELY ORIGINAL!  Stories are just good, or bad, and this one is kick-butt.<br /><br />This is a low-budget movie with heart.  Watching Christian Bale's 'deterioration' into a feeling human being was fascinating without becoming too sticky.  Bale is perhaps one of the only action-capable actors to pull off such a demanding role.  Gun Kata is a concept that has been around for a long time without anyone placing a name and philosophy to it.  Yes, the odds he survives are unrealistic, but so is flipping upside down while firing an M-16 and actually hitting people.  What's important is that gun kata is a means of explaining the mythic capabilities of the hero in a cool way.  And the action scenes pay off in a huge way.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, when Bale shows up in his white cleric's outfit, he has so morphed into the ultimate good guy that you just can't wait for him to explode.  This is one movie that actually pulls you in, makes you think, and entertains you.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00008J4P5|4.0|This CD is full of many different types of songs, some sound classic,some slow, some modern rock and others popish. I personally like most people was drawn in by thier hit: Seven Nation Army, then I thought a lot about this CD. At first, I read the booklet and thought they were some christian band and wanted to refund the CD. Then, I liked the CD and then thought it to be a good indie album. My favorite songs are the first 3 and I also like Ball and Biscuit. This is a great CD, but I would STRONGLY RECOMEND YOU LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE YOU BUY IT ...
B00009TB5G|4.0|First off, I loved this movie!  <BR>Having said that, any who haven't seen this movie (is there anyone?) and has read the books will notice that this movie is actually the first two thirds of the book, plus things hinted at in Tolkein's appendices.  As with the Fellowship Extended DVD, however, the extra time should flesh out more of the plot points and hopefully bring it closer to the book (why was Aragorn knocked over the cliff?).  The only real problem I had with this film was Faramir, a noble and just character in the novels who I truly admired, was turne into something of a jerk in this movie.<br />Also, The Battle of Helm's deep is one of THE most intense moments (scenes) I've experienced in a movie, though I fear it loses some of it's impact in the living room setting (and why were the Elves there?).<br />Also, I am looking forward to the appendices on this edition as I truly enjoyed those found on The Fellowship of the Ring.  This DVD is a must buy for any fantasy fan.  And if you're one of those rare individuals who hate these movies, go watch the animated ones.  Maybe that will give you a better apprciation for what Peter Jackson has accomplished.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I really like Godsmack's music. It's loud and heavy without sounding abrasive. Their third album, faceless reminds me more of thier first CD because the music sounds less darkly contemplative like Awake and more like the energetic and vicious tracks of thier debut. Songs 'Make Me Believe' and \\"I F***ing Hate You' stand out in my mind as the most overwhelmingly fierce.<BR>     Even though this was recorded in a warehouse and not in a studio, it never sounds hollow or weak. The album starts with the unsettling sounds of helicopters, sirens and guns and ends with the haunting and powerful song 'Serenity' that hits radio at the end of June. This song has the quiet ominousness of Slipknot's song 'Iowa' but somehow sounds more genuine. The rhythmic tribal song that leads up to it has the same effect, but in a more subtle way.<BR>     This is an excellent album that rock fans will really like. I loved it. The robust guitars, heavy, tribal sounding drums and Sully's rich voice all accentuate each other and all around sound magnificent. This CD is wicked.
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones commanded my immediate and continued attention.  I don't believe I have ever had such an emotional book-reading experience.  I cried and sometimes sobbed through most of the book.  It hit many nerves:  many of us have deaths in our families we can hardly bare--deaths of brothers, fathers, kids in high school, children next door, soldiers in far away countries.  A book like this rubs those emotions raw.  I found it to be beautifully cathartic.<br />There were loose ends and opportunities lost amongst the plotline--the &quot;heaven&quot; where Susie lived never quite took shape; the visitation to Ruth's body was a purposeless jolt.<br />All-in-all, it was a very emotional, beautifully written book, especially for a first-time novel.  I could easily see a cinematic version of this book but I doubt it could convey the visceral experience of the written version.
B00005JLR2|2.0|i thought movie was o.k. it wasn't that great. sure i did like the animation but disney is losing their touch. it just didnt have much of a plot it just dragged on and on. it never touched me.<BR>disney should look out cause things like shrek and spirited away are rolling in the cash. but if you are a huge disney fan go ahead buy it but its not a huge loss if you dont id go for studio ghibli related items
1400031362|5.0|Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Bostwana, has a great deal to think about. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Mma Ramotswe's fiance and the owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, has been acting strangely of late. He is unusually listless and he seems uninterested either in his business or in her. What can be wrong with him?<br />Meanwhile, although she gets her fair share of clients, Mma Ramotswe's detective agency is not exactly prospering. Fortunately, Ramotswe's assistant, Mma Makutsi, proves to be an invaluable asset. She not only becomes the acting manager of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, but she even takes on a lucrative case of her own. While Makutsi investigates the moral character of four contestants in the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest, Mma Ramotswe looks into a possible poisoning for an important &quot;Government Man&quot;.<br />Mma Ramotswe's sweet nature, unerring instincts and inherent common sense make her both a wonderful friend and a superb detective. Mma Makutsi comes into her own in this novel, as she shows herself to be both an excellent investigator and a shrewd manager. I recommend &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls&quot; for its gentle charm, its wry humor and its unique and memorable characters.
0393057658|4.0|Baseball of yesteryear was played with a lot less money and players were evaluated on various subjective criteria.  Now the money involved is much more and some people, including Billy Beane, Bill James, and others, are saying that statistical analysis can be used to put together a good team.<br />While reading this book you may re-think how a baseball player is evaluated.  It's interesting how Beane's philosophy of avoiding outs (including sacrifices) at all costs and emphasizing getting on base (through walks) contrasts with so many people, including his own coaches and experienced players.<br />Naturally, it is fun to compare Oakland's success under Beane to other organizations; let's say the Atlanta Braves (John Schuerholz) and the New York Yankees (Brian Cashman).  Since 1998 (when Beane became GM) through 2002 the A's have won 457 regular-season games, finished first in their division twice and won no playoff series.  In that time period, Schuerholz's Braves have won 493 games won their division each of those years and have won 4 division and league championships.  Cashman's Yankees have won 497 games, 8 division and league championships and 3 World Series.  Maybe these three general managers operate pretty well given their respective environments.  Since Beane did not go to Boston we will never know if he could have made the Red Sox more successful (although Bill James is in their front office).<br />This book is definitely worth the read.  It gives the reader a lot to think about and perhaps the reader's view of the game will be different.  Those who are in fantasy leagues might be particularly interested in some of the analysis.  Some of the hero worship of Billy Beane could be toned down; he has only been at this business for 5+ years.  On the other hand, Michael Lewis depicts Beane as more than human who can't stand to watch his own team play.  Maybe he'll be the Branch Rickey of our times but it will take several more years to find out.<br />Perhaps themost troubling for the sport are the conclusions near the end of the book: is this all worth it?  The fans, the owners, the coaches and managers and even the players want the &quot;flashy&quot; baseball.  Move the fences in and hit more home runs.  Do the hits and runs and the base stealing -- that is what sells tickets and makes the sports highlights.  How many championships have you won?  Do we really want the game to be managed by spreadsheets and statistical projections?
B000099T2L|5.0|This album was surprising because I was really expecting the &quot;you go girl&quot; tunes. Beyonce crafted a work of art. The songs have depth and meaning and one can relate to any of these songs. Its all about love and relationships but at the same time its real and not someting that was created for the sake of album sales. Standout tracks include, Speechless, Baby Boy, Be with You, Yes, Crazy in Love, Signs and THe Closer I Get to You. This is a mature effort that's worth every penny.
B000000OAC|3.0|Yes its blatant Queens one of the best hard rock bands of all time but this is one of their hardest albums. \\"We Will Rock You\\" is one of their most famous song and probley their hardest rocking next to Ogre Battle. \\"We Are The Champions\\" is one of the greatest songs of all time that you have herd a 1000 times! \\"Spread Your Wings\\" is a really good Power ballad. \\"Fight From The Inside\\" is just a cool kind of anthm type song. \\"Get Down Make Love\\" is a cool and funky song that Queen used a lot more later on in their carrier. \\"It's Late\\" is a really Pretty Ballad\\" Brian May sings on a lot of Queen songs but \\" Sleeping on the sidewalk\\" is the only good one and not only is it good its great! But as for \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" it just [stinks] with a passion. \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" is also a really bad song! \\"Who Needs You\\" is just down right bad and the same goes for \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" So this is not Queens best album by a far!
B00005KB9R|3.0|This is a pretty good album alright, but exactly how highly you rate it may depend on a couple of factors.<br />First, you should know that this was the last album of the original three Wailers, and that if you are really into the music of Peter Tosh (I can't say that I am), then you may prefer this to the later albums featuring Marley as the sole leader (which is my point of view). Anyway, just to point out that you do have Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer singing and playing here.<br />Secondly the album has Marley's most commercially successful song I Shot the Sheriff, which was covered by Eric Clapton and was a #1 hit in the US. Other than that there are great versions of Get Up Stand Up, and Burnin' and Lootin', as well as some songs also heard in prototype versions on African Herbsman.<br />The next studio album Natty Dread was for me a big leap forwards, and at least one expert agreed with me:<br />Betta music, betta lyrics... it have a betta feelin'. Catch A Fire and Burnin' have a good feelin', but Natty Dread is improved.&quot; (Bob Marley, 1974).<br />However, for the Marley/Wailers completist, this is a classic album and not to be missed. (Well, I bought it anyway, and I certainly enjoy playing it.)
6305546789|5.0|This is easily the best of the Halloween films, and in my opinion the best horror film in history! Its got Michael Myers the greatest and ruthless killer in the history of killers. Jamie Lee Curdes, a very sexy woman who plays the Killers victom! Donald Presence is the star of the movie he plays a doctor who has been working with Michael Myers since he was a kid and thinks there is no stopping Michael at all! This Movie is one of the few killer movies to ever scare me and it does so because of the scary music, it gets me ever time! And Michael has such confedince with how the vitoms run and he walks really slow like \\"Your not getting away!\\" SO as you see this movie is a must own a reall classic!

B00005QENZ|4.0|This is an awsome album, with Steven Tyler blowing ever other vocalist away(Like usuall!). Joe Perry The Greatest guitar player to ever pick a guitar up, pumping out awsome guitar riff's and amazing solos! And The Rythm section is over the top! The hit singles &quot;Eat The Rich&quot; &quot;Livin' On The Edge&quot; Cryin'&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot; made this Aerosmith's best selling album to date! but it also helps when the movie Waynes World 2 used &quot;Shut Up And Dance&quot; and Ace Vantura used &quot;Line Up&quot; in their films to boost sales! But The songs &quot;Fever&quot; &quot;Walk On Down&quot; and &quot;Flesh&quot; are some of Aerosmith strongest tracks on the album not to mention some of Perrys best solos... ever!! &quot;Get A Grip&quot; and &quot;Got To Love It&quot; are really fin trippin' rock songs. but its &quot;Eat The Rich&quot; that takes the cake on best song on the album and solo. And maybe riff? This album offers the bad boys from Boston (none of which actualy from Boston!) at 150% this is a must own album for any fan of good music!

B000099T2L|4.0|Well, She starts off good with this cd..the first 3 tracks are off the hook..especially with her and Sean Paul..but the song \\"Hip Hop Star\\"..i guess is just a little much. She is a little more \\"sexual\\"..talkin bout being a \\"Naughy Girl\\"..and \\"love it when you scream my name\\"..is another track, which is always welcomed, and wonderful to hear..I guess, all in all, the album is a little too \\"pop\\"..i expected less slow songs, and what was the point of saying missy elliot was featured in the song \\"Signs\\"...when all she says is like a sentence?...all in all, a worth while album, the upbeat tracks are awesome, aswell as the various other tracks..Best \\"slow\\" song would be \\"Dangerously Inlove\\"..best upbeat song would be \\"Baby Boy\\"...best song all together is \\"That's How You Like It\\" with Jay Z.
B00005LIN0|5.0|You must disregard many of the earlier customer reviews of this DVD; apparently a lot of people thought they were going to be seeing a straight movie, or a Hollywoodization of the opera made in the 1950s. This, kind readers, is the REAL opera as its creators [George Gershwin and his brother, Ira] intended it and the Glyndebourne Opera production is beautifully opened up, as they say, for the movie camera by the eminent British director, Trevor Nunn. It's all under the direction of that nonpareil British conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, who has since moved on to the plum job of the conductorial world as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic.<br />The cast is superb. Willard White owns the role of Porgy and his acting is superb as the cripple whose heart is broken. Cynthia Haymon sounds wonderful and looks terrific as Bess. Gregg Baker not only has the huge, sonorous bass that Crown requires, but he looks the part better than anyone I've ever seen in this opera-- and I've seen at least five productions, going back to Leontyne Price and William Warfield at the old New York City Opera. Damon Evans is a suitably oily Sportin' Life. Marietta Simpson, the eminent Mahlerian contralto, sings an absolutely riveting (and hilarious) Maria. Serena, Jake's widow, is ably taken by Cynthia Carey. Some of the 'minor' roles are portrayed by an actor while the singing is done by a trained singer; there is absolutely no problem with the lip-synching--indeed I didn't know until I saw the credits. Clara, the character who sings 'Summertime,' is acted by a beautiful young woman named Paula Ingram, and sung by the delectable Harolyn Blackwell. The ill-fated Jake is acted by Gordon Hawkins, and sung by the talented Bruce Hubbard.<br />Visually the production is as detailed and realistic as any I've seen. The videography is fluid and unobtrusive. The denizens of Catfish Row are sung superbly and their movements intricately, and realistically, choreographed.<br />I don't imagine I'll be wanting any other DVDs of this, one of my favorites operas (and certainly my favorite American opera) for a long time to come.<br />Scott Morrisonng any other DVDs of this, one of my favorites operas (and certainly my favorite American opera) for a long time to come.<br />Scott Morrison
B000056HOZ|4.0|This chonological colection of Springsteen's work is great for any Springsteen fan. The 2 DVD set is essentially his greatest hits in video form. A lot of these videos are live performances and show how great Bruce Springsteen is as a live performer. Bruce Springsteen truly is The Boss, and this video collection adds to the legacy. Highlights of the DVD include a rivoting live performance of War, found on the bos set, and a rare version of Fire, a song he wrote for the Pointer Sisters. This also shows some of the later work, including Secret Garden from Jerry Maguire, and Murder Incorporated from his greatest hits album. 4 out of 5 because of Weak representation form the pre-BITUSA era.
B00005JL2O|3.0|While Austin Powers in Goldmember is certainly a funny movie, featuring several of the most classic scenes from the Austin Powers series, it is ultimately something of a disappointment.  We all thought Austin lost his mojo in the second movie, but the series itself ran off and left its mojo behind early on in this third film.  It's hard to explain, but this just doesn't even feel like a movie to me.  I was still waiting for the movie to really kick in to serious gear when the credits began rolling.  There seem to be serious problems with the plot and script; too many things just happen for no apparent reason, giving the impression that the filmmakers were not overly concerned with maintaining the causality of the storyline.  One thing that really bothered me was Austin's appearance out of nowhere early on to arrest a newly-returned Dr. Evil.  The plot required Dr. Evil to go to prison, but, after watching him escape from his nemesis over the course of two movies, seeing Dr. Evil captured so easily seemed a great disservice to such a great character.  The ending is also disappointing; I hope this is not the final Austin Powers movie, but it certainly wraps up in series-ending style; while predictable, such an ending would not have been terribly bad if the filmmakers had put more effort into injecting some life or suspense into it; as it is, things turn out quite silly, with only one character turning away from the sappy denouement and implanting us with hope that we may see Austin return some day.<br />Goldmember, a new fourth character played by Mike Myers, may well be the worst character in the history of motion pictures.  While he could be slightly amusing on occasion, Goldmember's unnecessary, disgusting, corny role shot big holes into the movie named for him.  The roller skates, the skin-eating, everything about the man turned me off completely.  The Mole, in my opinion, was yet another terrible character.  No one enjoyed Fred Savage's performance in The Wonder Years as much as I did, but both he and his character looked uncomfortably out of place in the presence of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.  I also, to be quite frank, disapproved mightily of the disservice done to Heather Graham's character of Felicity Shagwell from the second film; I wanted an explanation for her absence, but all I got was a new character in the form of Foxxy Cleopatra.  Beonce Knowles did an admirable job in the role, but to me her character just doesn't fit, and Austin's largely absent mojo flexing in the ladies' department made me feel as if I were watching Austin going about his business as an old man.<br />All criticism aside, there are some classic moments in this film.  The opening is brilliant, producing some of the most memorable cameo appearances to ever hit the big screen.  Even this cannot compare to the scenes featuring the young versions of Austin and Dr. Evil, however.  Josh Zuckerman did a great job aping the mannerisms and inflections of Dr. Evil, but Aaron Himelstein was all over the young Austin Powers role; he had Austin's look, expressions, mannerisms, and voice down pat; it's really one of the most impressive impersonation jobs I've ever seen.  The humor and entertainment, though, are just too few and far between for the movie as a whole.  I think the plot holes could have been plugged effectively by a couple of the deleted scenes included on the DVD, yet a number of those deleted scenes were mercifully cut from the final print before doing even more self-inflicted damage to this disappointing sequel of a sequel.  I think Mike Myers got too caught up in the whole Austin Powers frenzy, placing the characters before the story itself.  The result is, by and large, a second-rate parody of a formerly ingenious parody.r Years as much as I did, but both he and his character looked uncomfortably out of place in the presence of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.

B00005221M|1.0|The Directors Expanded Edition is not an expanded edition.   It lengthens a few scenes very slightly with nothing added but IT HAS CUT DIALOGUE AND MOMENTS IN OTHER SCENES.  The musicial score is re-edited and the sound quality is uneven - the battle scenes are too loud and some of the dialogue scenes are too soft.  The theatrical version is a much more enjoyable film and unfortunately that is only available on VHS.
B00000JG41|5.0|Buy this album if nothing more than to bear witness to one of the great vocal performances of the last several years. Few would question Mike Patton's abilities as a singer/screamer/crooner...etc  But this is the first release he's involved in that successfully integrates all of these things. If you played this for somebody unaware of what Mike Patton does, you could easily convince them that there are several different vocalists on these tracks. The vocal style of one track is COMPLETELY different than that of another. And often, the background vocals are completely different as well. I have had this playing, and I have seen jaws drop at the statement, &quot;All of the vocals on this CD are one guy.&quot; Not to say that Mike Patton is the only thing this band has going for them. The musicianship is beyond stellar, but for the first time on a bungle CD, this is Mike's show.
B000089RVX|4.0|Worth having in your collection. Afew songs that sounded like others on the album. She has an amazing voice that works so well with the music. I'm looking forward to there next album.<BR>Cheers
B00005O5CM|5.0|this movie puts all of those blonde cliches to sleep.  it pries on them then uses them to the movie's advantage.  I love this movie and now i'm an even bigger fan of Reese witherspoon.  Great movie for a girl's night in or just to lift your spirits.
B000002BE9|5.0|I am completely in love with Fiona Apple's voice. She could probably be the most talented singer in this world. Her voice is amazing. It's so powerful and amazing. Her songwriting is  amazing as well. I bought her second CD first. But I can say I like this one better. No matter what, I will always love this girl's voice. I can't wait til she makes more music!<BR>This CD is just amazing. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
B00006AG5N|5.0|You can buy like 10 CD's to get these songs, or save a lot a dough and just get this one. By the way, there are 31 #1 hits on the CD not 30.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|If you are looking for fine script-writing, directing and acting, this is it.  What you can find is a story that is so different from the ususal American standard plots, and it is refreshing.  The performances are superb, too.  Keep an eye on the boy's natural acting ability - he almost out-shines Grant who is also superb.  If Hollywood movies are make-believe, this film stands out to reveal the facts of life.
B000009HF2|4.0|Referred to in certain circles as \\"the Star Wars of music\\" (i.e., the blockbuster album that officially turned the music business into BIG business), Frampton Comes Alive! came at a crucial time in the career of its namesake: Four albums into a solo career that hadn't really taken off, the former Humble Pie guitarist went into the studio to listen to live tapes from the previous year's tour in support of Frampton (A&M-1975) for an upcoming live album. Upon hearing the tracks, visionary record man and A&M boss Jerry Moss was so excited by the results that he demanded the album be released as a double LP. Like there's a chance in hell that the bean counters and corporate lackeys of today would let that happen now. Anyway, the bet paid off: Frampton Comes Alive! went on to become the biggest selling live album of all time and Frampton himself became a huge star and `70s icon. Sure, \\"Show Me The Way\\" and \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" have been played to death, but they still stand up. The acoustic tracks are quite lovely and heartfelt; the cover of The Stones' \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" rivals the original; and \\"Lines On My Face\\" and \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" retain their majesty and momentum more than a quarter of a century later. And we didn't even get to Frampton's rockin' band and killer guitar playing! On the occasion of its 25th Anniversary, Universal released a deluxe edition of Frampton Comes Alive! in 2001. This album was love at first sound for us and it's still very near and dear to our hearts. Obviously.
6304698623|5.0|this is my favorite movie of all time! the first time i saw it i had to rewatch it.  the story is about a girl that used to be rich but loses everything when she learns her father is killed in battle.  i love the music and the multi ethnic cast. don't rent it.. buy it!
B000002TQB|4.0|Clever pop tunes and dry quips from the English quartets' Parklife create an entertaining milieu of musicianship that will certainly induce delightful head bobbing and toe tapping. Although I believe Blur's next self-titled record is much more heartfelt and poignant, Parklife makes up for the lack of sincerity with undeniably catchy pop tunes. Parklife, Tracy Jacks and Girls &amp; Boys are all delightful drops of ear candy. End Of A Century is also another excellent track. For a more thorough outing from an exceptionally talented band, I'd recommend Blur's eponymous outing. For anyone looking for a light-hearted, catchy pop album, Parklife is your best bet.
B000002BYD|4.0|You can't go wrong with Pearl Jam.
B000002KN8|5.0|It's a wonderful, full of great melodies album, that kickstarted two brilliant careers of ultratalented musicians : one was soon-to-develop-new-grounds-band called Depeche Mode that changed their captain, and second was of course, the composer of this album, young prodigy Vince Clarke. Now, I read the other listeners' thoughts, that, like, cool that Clarke gone away so soon 'cause he's untalented and all. Let me tell you something: Martin Gore was a young prodigy on his own, and very soon he proved that to the whole world, developing the whole new sound in today's music. But that, of course, doesn't make Vince Clarke a less talented musician. Simply he had always more pop feeling in his music, and later he proved it with Yazoo and Erasure. And this album shines the same light: it's full with this brilliant simple minimalistic pop, &quot;future pop&quot; how they called it back in those days. &quot;New Life&quot;, &quot;What's Your Name?&quot;, &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot; and The Hit! - &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; are just examples of happy-pop-sound with awesome melody. &quot;Puppets&quot;, &quot;Big Muff&quot;, &quot;Tora!Tora!Tora!&quot; will take your happy mood away if you're too much happy at the time. :) But there's also darker sides - you can hear it on &quot;Photographic&quot;, one of my favorite DM songs ever, that features such a mystic sound and such a evening-dusk-gonna-scary-you melody, that I hardly heard something close to that even with today's fully computerised electronic music, that can produce every sound in the world it seems... <BR>My advise to everyone who simply likes good music is to buy this album, neverminding that sound is so simple and maybe even sounds ridiculous to some today's listeners. And to those who hate it, prefering post-Speak &amp; Spell style of DM, I'd suggest to never forget the roots. Speak &amp; Spell had to be created so we could enjoy now the wonder of Depeche Mode and talents of Martin Gore!!
0321127420|3.0|This book has been getting a lot of hype -the followup to Fowler's seminal Refactoring, enterprise edition of the GoF, etc etc. <br />It's a dense and informative read. If you didnt know anything about cricket, you will by the end, as all its examples are basd on the game. I, sadly, find cricket deadly dull as a consequence of having it force fed at me in the UK educational system. This may bias me against the examples somewhat. <br />As to the content, well, it is a set of patterns focused on 'enterprise' applications. In this context, enterprise means server-side code connected to a database, usually with a Web Front end. Martin goes into superb depth on how to map from databases to java and .net objects, making you think about whether or not the stuff that your framework of choice gives you is the right tool for the job. Sadly, all that does is make you more aware of the failings of EJB, JDBC, whatever .NET has. Because, unless you are going to roll your own database bridge by hand, you are going to have to run with what they give you -whether it [stinks] or not.<br />I dont do much O/R mapping. I hand it off to tools like Castor and worry about my real problems: shipping web services to implausible deadlines to be managed by an operations team that phone me whenever something goes wrong. So my problems are web service related 'good API design', and 'executional patterns': how to design code that is easily tested, what is a good strategy for implementing configuration information, what is a good XML format for future flexibility. I also have to worry about the client side: how to architect a client that works well over long haul and intermittent links, and how to present this to the user.<br />Martin's book doesnt cover these kind of problems. I do like his critique of Entity EJBs (as opposed to session beans), where he observes that because EJBs are all distributable, people tend to do just that, leading to performance problems that are very profitable to him asa consultant. <br />The implicit message is that these days, he is spending his time tuning object to DB linkages, and not worrying about all the other aspects of the problem. Another reviewer mentioned security, but my concern is about designing for high availablity, a series of practises that focus on redundancy, caching, and interdependencies and self-diagnosis of faults, rather than caring about minutae of O/R binding. <br />So I'm giving the book 3-stars, as it doesn't suit my problems. Maybe it suits other people better.<br />-steve
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is a great film, with amazing special effects (I've seen it five times in the theater).  Granted, it strays from the book, but it remains true to the essence of the story-- and Gollum alone makes it worth watching over and over.  WORD TO THE WISE-- wait until November when the extended version of the DVD is going to be released.  Waiting for the extended release made SUCH a huge difference in Lord of the Rings-- giving more background to the story and providing details and extras that really added so much to the film.  This one will be no different.
B000002TQB|5.0|Parklife is one of the best cds of 94. There are many, many fun songs on here that are guarenteed to brighten your day. The first time I heard this, I was stunned. Blur is mostly known for their hit song that can be heard in stadiums across the globe, Song #2. I have nothing against this one, but Blur has so much more to offer than this one rock song. On this cd you'll find superb melodies (Tracy Jacks/Parklife), hard rock (#2), beautiful ballads (End Of A Century), and even a little disco (Girls &amp; Boys). Other notable tracks include Far Out and The Debt Collector. This cd really has a little bit of everything, something for everyone. I recommened this to all fans of music.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is the last great animated film before computers took over hollywood and ruined moives forever.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I might be wrong live recordings consists of a compilation of some of the best songs from Kid A and Amnesiac (which doesnt say much 95% of them are tied for the best in my opinion) live. Since Radiohead is obviously one of the best live bands around this is quite a entertaining album. Each song is modified for live performances, but they all sound great especially &quot;like spinning plates&quot; which is the standout track for me is completely different than the amnesiac version(which is also good). The electronical confusion is replaced by beautiful piano work and some synth in the background. Thom's vocals are exceptionally good on this one. &quot;Idioteque&quot; is incredibly energetic and is enough reason to buy this album alone. All the songs on this album benefit in sound except &quot;the national anthem&quot; which is good but without the brass instruments it loses some energy.  The final song &quot;true love waits&quot; bring it back to Thom solo on the acoustic like the old &quot;the bends&quot; days. True Love waits is an amazing song with great lyrics and equally impressive guitar....Thom shows he is one of the best. There's something for everyone on this album...even if you werent fans of Kid A/Amnesiac you will probably enjoy these live versions more. For everyone wishing for the return of &quot;the Bends&quot; take this era of Radiohead's music for what it is and appreciate it because to me Radiohead wouldn't be as impressive if they didn't progess drastically...it gives you a different album for any mood you;re in and this album is no exception.
B000089CJI|2.0|...the rest is a total let-down. The singer is very cheesy and pretentious. There are cringe-worthy lyrics in nearly every track. Too bad it all isn't as good as the first song.
B000099T2L|5.0|With me already being a DC4 and DC3, I had to go buy \\"Dangerously In Love\\" as SOON AS IT CAME OUT!!!!!! My god this summer is so hot with music.  This cd is more than what I expected, it is wonderful.  I love basically how she has changed up her style, doesn't sound like Destiny's Child material at all.

B000002H2H|5.0|good ol metallica! i had real high expectations for the album after the thrashy, show no mercy kill em all, and this not only met my expectations, but surpassed them. it is hard, fast, great lyrics, and the drums are AMAZING! there is nothing wrong with this disc, and is their 3rd best, 3rd only to master of puppets and st. anger (so shoot me, i love that album). i highly reccomend it, and it should be in EVERY metal fans collection. run, dont WALK to your CD shop to get this masterpeice from the thrash masters, metallica!
B00005JKPF|4.0|You see... Before I saw the movie, I believe that this X2 will blow it's predecor. And It did. The plot, the characterization, the action, it's awsome. I almost scream seeing how nightcrawler takedown the guard at whitehouse. And my favorite scene, is when colossus change his skin to metal. (If only Bryan (Singers) give him more portion than just a cameo.)<BR>As I say in the title of this review, it's a great movie. What I don't feel right is the ending. It's seems like they force Jean Grey to end up being dark phoenix. (they show it a little in the end) But the story didn't strong enough to do so.<BR>Let's see... okay, Prof. X is still weak. I agree. But you have Nightcrawler. He can easily teleport and take Jean back to the blackbird. Just like he do before to rouge. If that can't do, don't forget, we have boby the iceman. He can change that whole water into ice in a few second, or at least jean can hold it for him. Uh..., one more thing. Isn't Storm a weather master? Isn't she have the ability to fly? As I put it delicately like \\"the man\\" himself, enough said. So in short, ending is weak. They should figure out something better to end the story.<BR>Well anyway, we got kelly hu on this x2. And the non-make up of rebecca romijn stamos. So I guess I can live with that not so good ending. Now if only they didn't make lot's of DVD version of this movie. What we need is just one dvd with a hunka extras!
B00008H2LB|2.0|Ugh. I won't spend much time on this review, simply because it isn't worth my time. Let's get a couple things straight : Linkin Park's biggest downfall is their vocals. Sure, they're arguably decent musicians, but if you can't sing, then what's the point? Chester's voice is scratchy and painful to listen to, and it totally butchers potentially good songs. It's the kind of voice where you know he hurts afterwards. That's probably why this album took so long to make, because after they recorded one song Chester most likely wasn't able to talk for the next two weeks. <br />Anyway, the only reason I gave Meteora 2 stars is because of 'Faint', which would be a great song if not for Chester's nasty vocals, so it's only decent as it is.<br />Do yourself a favor, save the 15 bucks, and go by Evanescence's Fallen instead, or even Avril Lavigne for crying out loud, it's better than this. Evanescence actually have someone who can sing, and beyond that too.
B000002LOE|3.0|R.E.M.'s imitation of late 60's stringy pop (like the Troggs' \\"Love is All Around,\\" covered by R.E.M. in this period) is to the fore here in a way that sounds aggressively contrived and even saccharin now. This record has its moments ( e.g., \\"Country Feedback\\": the ghost of Elvis meets Freud), but both the songs that evoke sorrow (\\"Low\\") and mirth (\\"Shiny Happy\\") depend on attitudes that seem unpleasantly theatrical top to bottom, like a harlequin confessing his pains in therapeutic terminology.  The performances, while obviously sharp, have a plodding precision and a shiny, chilly production utterly alien to an early R.E.M.  record like \\"Reckoning\\"; ironically, these slick production values are reminiscent of many \\"big\\" records made c. 1990, like Tom Petty's \\"Full Moon Fever.\\"  That's OK, but it ain't special.  R.E.M. is occasionally still interesting even as they become more careful and contrived, but I prefer the more evocative and spontaneous sounding rock'n'roll of their early period, music that seems harder to place and that's more truly \\"out of time.\\"
B000002H33|5.0|this is metallica at their thrashing, metallica best! This album, Ride the Lightening and Kill em' All defined the thrash metal genre, and will never be surpassed. such raw agression and deadly fast guitars have never been doubled by any other band. sure, metallica was inspired by venom, but metallic influenced more bands than almost all artists. this is a great cd, and can be listened without skipping any tracks. highlights are battery and master of puppets. great cd, you cannnot NOT have it. this is the best metallica cd ever produced, no question. go get it...
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence is a fine band for the American scene, but they have borrowed heavily from an Italian band that goes by the name of Lacuna Coil.  <br />When you are picking up your Evanescence discs please make sure to take a listen to some of the samples of a band that pre-dates Evanescence.  They go by the name of Lacuna Coil.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Maybe not his best look, but definatly his best CD. I've heard all Marilyns CD's and this one stands out the most. Dont get me wrong, I think all of Manson's albums are great, but pff who made Antichrist his \\"best\\"? this, Mechanical Animals in my point of view is incredibly under-rated! There should be a 6th voting button on this CD. I love their glam/rock sort of attitude and sound here. The first 6 songs are brilliant, their just pure rock. My favourite song on this album is 'Disassociative'. Their emotional too, and its good to hear a not-type-slayer-lyrics band for once. I would'nt call this C.D heavy. 'Great Big White World' goes for about 5 minutes, and has a fantastic solo in it. It's pretty slow at times. You've probably heard the big hit off the album, 'The Dope Show', Twiggy's best bass part ever. The chorus is cool, it's catchy, and his lyrics are meaningful, like always. The title song 'Mechanical Animals' is a CD highlight and Manson's voice is grunge style. 'They'll never be good to you, bad to you, they'll never be anything, anything at all.' In this song, Manson has a voice thing done to make it sounds cool. I don't like 'Rock is Dead' ANYMORE. 'The Speed Of Pain' would probably be my second favourite. The opening guitar riff is great. Done by Twiggy!... Remember? It's Marilyn Manson in the chorus also. Download this song to see if the albums for you. But after this its the end of the rock songs. Next is glam/hard rock. I love it. Their attitude is so cool. Skip 'Posthuman' though, that song sucks. 'I Want To Disappear', wow, Has a good bass part, and its fast, and again, Marilyn's lyrics...their...bad, in a good way course. 'I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)', is a single, but not my favourite. Another glam song? sure, 'New Model, no.15' Just as good as 'I Want To Disappear', (5/5), Their very alike. The chorus is very catchy, 'I'm the new, I'm the new, new model, I've got nothing inside, Better at the head, and better at the office'. 'User Friendly' is another glam rock masterpiece. His lyrics have gone very bad-ass here. I love all these songs! Except the next one... 'The Last Day on Earth' is another rock one. Emotional too.  'Coma White', ends the CD VERY WELL. Slow, and a little heavier at some times. Another single for the album. See the video. The bass part in this song is awesome, a lot like the others, but the solo is pretty bad. Buy this C.D right now, If you love real-rock, you'll fall in love.
B00005MCX2|5.0|C'était les concerts qui étaient le point fort et le cheval de bataille du groupe depuis 1967. En 1973, Hawkwind lança un double LP Live intitulé «Space Ritual». Cet album est devenu avec le recul ; le meilleur album du groupe et un album phare dans l'histoire du rock. <br />La réédition «remastered» nous propose  trois excellents «bonus tracks» tirés de deux de leur concert donnés à Londres en 1972.<br />Cet album est une pièce incontournable d'anthologie du «Space Rock».
B000002UUX|5.0|this is the best effort ever to come from one of the best bands (2nd only to metallica) to emerge from the metal scene. this death and hate filled disc displays friedman and mustaine at their grundin, guitar best. great drums and bass. infact there is a bass solo on this disc, which is amazing! you gotta pick this up! it is up to par with classics like iron maidens number of the beast and metallicas masters of puppets! sadly, due to injurys dealing with mustaine, megadeth is no more - but more discs are avaible from them, like the KILLER world with heros and count down to extinction. awesome disc, must have for all metal fans. Holy wars is the best track!
B00008LJFO|5.0|This is a must-have if you are a Whitesnake fan!  There is not one weak track on this album.  There are tracks from the old, original Whitesnake days (the original version of &quot;Fool For Your Lovin'&quot; is here!), Whitesnake 80's era, Coverdale/Page and solo Coverdale.  Each disc is 77 minutes long and all the tracks have been personally selected by David Coverdale.  The liner notes contain an in-depth discussion with David, his history, the tracks he decided to include here and why.  Each and every track here have been digitally remastered and sound incredible.  The stuff from 1978 sounds as good as the stuff from today!  The album is well worth the import price and it's a crying shame it has not been released in the States.  Get it!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This absolutely fantastic companion to The Matrix blew me away with its quality of story, quality of animation, pace, action and soundtrack.<br />It tells so many smal stories that supplement and explain someof the unexplained aspects of Matrix and Matrix Reloaded.<br />I'm not a big Anime fan - some of this is &quot;anime&quot; - most of it isn't.  If you liked the Matrix and the Matrix reloaded, you'll enjoy this too.  There are apparently two versions - one that comes with a CD soundtrack of Matrix unloaded and one that doesn't.<br />Check it!
038572179X|5.0|This was my first Ian Mcewan book and it was truly magnificent.  It is a must read!  Rather than re-encapsulate the plot as previous reviewers have done so well, I would prefer to make a few other observations about this fine novel.<br />First, my experience reading the novel was that it WAS NOT a slow read, but,  I ,in fact, did read it slowly because I wanted to relish and savor each wonderful page.<br />The book brought me back to my childhood middle school English teacher who first introduced my class to the form of the novel with Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\".  From that day forward, I always thanked her for teaching me how to appreciate this form and I definitely do put ATONEMENT in the same classic category as \\"Great Expectations\\".  My English teacher nearly 40 years ago told us that a novel can reflect an entire lifetime of its characters or a period of a few years of their lives or merely about one day!  I could not conceive a story about ONE SINGLE DAY and her teaching confused me but I accepted it and learned what else I could. Now, with ATONEMENT, I fully appreciate her teaching because Mcewan does both.<br />Also, the characters and the plot revolved around one VULGAR four letter word which I choose not to type here because I want this review to clear the editors.  You will have to get the book and read it to find that one word.<br />Thirdly, for writers or others interested in creative writing, sprinkled throughout the novel, the author muses on the craft of writing and although these paragraphs don't necessarily advance the plot of this novel so much, they are nevertheless fascinating and insightful.  WRITERS, read this book for those few paragraphs!<br />...
B00008G9JO|5.0|I was shocked to see an average 3 star rating for what is perhaps one of the best albumns Tull ever produced. This album was my introduction to Tull and I clearly remember that the music simply blew me away - the listening experience was simply fantastic! Actually I don't think any other Tull album impressed me the way Heavy Horses did - maybe it is because it was the first Tull album I'd listened to, but still that doesn't negate the quality of music found in the album. acres wild, moths, the mouse police ..., heavy horses, good morning weathercock are all standout tracks. Believe me I'm a seasoned listener/collector of classic rock - for its memorable tunes, harmonies, flute and guitar work, this album has a few rivals even within the Tull canon itself - probably surpassed only by aqualung! and most of my friends share this opinion. if you're a fan of tull or classic rock BUY THIS CD NOW and i can assure you that you wont be disappointed!
B0000028M7|5.0|I pose this question because Dirt satisfies on every track, and this is not at all common even on such 5-star records as 'Abbey Road', 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Ten', 'OK Computer' etc.  This is an album by adults who are writing about serious adult problems with authentic emotion, and how rare is that?  The lyrics and the music are one in this.  I think this album works as literature.<br />And that's my $0.02.<br /><br />\\"Them Bones\\" - A great rock tune, maybe perfect, Opie and Anthony called it perfect when they were at WAAF in Worcester, whatever you think of those wankers, I liked them on WAAF but dislike their scatilogy nowadays.<br /><br />\\"Dam That River\\" - flows from them bones, very Power Full, awesome riff, I would beat anyone who criticizes this song. You negative reviewers what the f do you listen to, michael jackson?<br /><br />\\"Down in a Hole\\" - Frequently played on so-called alternative radio, and thankfully so, I run with my walkman, listen to the radio, and my pace picks up significantly when good songs come on, and this one makes me stride wide with no pain, that is my highest recommendation, it is a physical fact, Puddle of Mud cannot make me run faster cuz their songs don't really inspire, you people how sit at home and listen to b*llsh*t what the f are you thinking about?<br /><br />\\"Sickman\\" - brilliant, counterpoint, complex, thoughtful, yeah people have drug problems and that is bad but it's better than the business crazies I have to deal with every freakin business day.  I am so sick of business people with their schpiel, it is digusting how they spew their BS nonstop, I know they do it for their families so one cannot really blame them, it's just uninteresting and pollutes the atmosphere.  What is life all about?  Raising kids by surviving however one can?  That's what insects do.  Humans should do more.<br /><br />\\"Rooster\\" - well, I'm getting a little tired of this one, after 800 replays on the walkman.<br /><br />\\"Junkhead\\" - another brilliant song(Beatles-Who brilliant), but after Staley's death we just be discretely remorseful, it's really too bad, but it's superb rock, it's tuneful and heavy.  \\"What's my drug of choice?  Well what have you got?\\".  Cuz I do it a lot.  Can you believe The Man let this song be published?  Layne must have been very unhappy. Jerry may be unhappy, I hope he is doing well these days, but the loss of his Dad seems to haunt him.<br /><br />\\"Dirt\\" - This song almost makes me cry after the death of Layne.<br /><br />\\"God Smack\\" is the best song on the album, it is too serious for the pathetic so-called \\"alternative rock\\" radio stations to play,  it is one of the best songs by addicts, I didn't mind that another rock group stole this title for their name, that was a tribute and their first album was OK, the chorus and verse were both superb, one can sing along at top volume and be completely satisfied.<br /><br />\\"Intro (Dream Sequence)\\" is funny.  Short Black Sabbath parody.<br /><br />\\"Hate To Feel\\" is also brilliant.  I hate to admit that I've become just like my old man, but I need to admit that's just I've  become, and youze people you stupid f*ers should think about that, we all become just like our dadses and momses.<br /><br />\\"Angry Chair\\" - oh this bring me back, although this is my least favorite song on this album, it resonates.  It is powerfully resonant.  Layne is great, I hope he is sitting on an angry chair in heaven.<br /><br />\\"Would\\" - When this one comes on the radio it makes me run very fast with a smile, people notice.<br /><br />In conclusion, there is not a weak track, there are almost no  albums in the rock world without weak tracks, \\"OK Computer\\" was brilliant thru the first 6 tracks and then it dogged out.  \\"Nevermind\\" had weaknesses.  All Beatles album had weaknesses, blame Paul.  But \\"Dirt\\" is strong from start to finish.  It can be played without embarrassment.  I wish \\"rock\\" groups would understand that you play albums at parties or for friends and want the albums to just rock without interruption, you want quality, but yet some of them include stupid tracks for stupid reasons.  I cite here Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Limp Bizkit, who had some great songs but had \\"artistic\\" reasons to include crappy tracks.tupid tracks for stupid reasons.

B00004SZWD|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever made!! I loved this album when my parents had it on eight track!! Every song is a classic.  The proof is so many of the \\"who's who's\\" in various areas (rap, r&b, rock, hip-hop, etc) were inspired to sample from this album. No collection is a collection without this album and I consider it the best ever made!!
B00008I8IF|5.0|I had been awaiting a new album by the Jayhawks, and Rainy Day Music met all of my expectations.  It's a great album, and so is the bonus disk.  I love the two renditions of &quot;Stumbling Though the Dark,&quot; the beauty of &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; and the charm of &quot;Eyes of Sarajane.&quot;  I've seen the Jayhawks live in the past year, so I was familiar with &quot;Tampa to Tulsa,&quot; another stand out on the album.  My favorite song; however, is on the bonus disk: &quot;Caught with a Smile on my Face.&quot;  I hope this album will bring many new fans to listen to the Jayhawks because that's what they deserve!
B00005JLYU|5.0|Summer time is here and Drew, Cameron and Lucy Liu want us to have a \\"Feel Good Time\\"!  The trio of eye candy crime fighters return for a sequel to their first hit film.  This time around, we have a devious fallen Angel, Madison Lee, as the villian du jour,  played very nicely by Demi Moore.  Forget an intricate plot or anything that will set you to thinking too heavy----this film is about fun, hotties--both female and male, cool effects and lots of laughs. \\"Full Throttle\\" introduces us to a new Bosley played by Bernie Mac, after the departure of Bill Murray, who played the first Bosley in the other movie.  Bernie Mac does a good job this time around and has good chemistry with the three lovely ladies.  Boyfriends, Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc, return to romance two of the angels and a host of cameos fill out the film---Bruce Willis, the Olsen Twins, Pink (who sings the movie theme song), rapper Eve and even former angel, Jacklyn Smith.  A perfect no brainer summer film, great for a matinee!  Don't miss it!
B00008PX8P|3.0|The center channel on Disc #1's Dolby 5.1 mix has a significant amount of static/crackling. I first thought it was my system but then i noticed that a few other audiophiles on this site complained about it too. Interestingly, I cannot find any way to contact the record company to ask about this defect. It doesn't seem to be a problem on the DTS mix, though. Perhaps many people play this so loud that they don't notice the static. Aside from this minor nit, this DVD is a CLASSIC!
B00008LDPU|2.0|I anticipated the Animatrix to be a good production. First I saw Final Flight of the Osiris which was the best anime short that I have ever seen. But then I saw The Second Renaissance I was disquested. The Second Renaissance was the worst short that I had ever seen in my WHOLE LIFE. After that, all the others were either boring, pointless or just plain lame. Do not buy this DVD...
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis has written a wonderful, insightful, warm book about using guile and teamwork to beat the big bully. For the past ten years, David has been consistently thwacked by Goliath. The low payroll MLB teams have always fared poorly against the mega-payers, i.e., the Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers, etc.<br />    Not any more, thanks to GM Billy Beane of the Oakland A's.<br />    By carefully drafting and trading for players who were not wanted by other clubs and forcing those players to play a team game where, for example, on-base-percentage is Gospel and attempting to steal is heresy, he has managed to create a ballclub at bargain basement prices that has the A's knocking on the door to baseball's penthouses, a province heretofore occupied by teams with payrolls three and four times larger than that of the A's.<br />    But what I found most interesting is the way Beane got these players to play his game, a \\"team\\" game, where working a pitcher to an eight pitch groundout is thought of as a team effort, an act that will draw dividends later in the game as the pitcher tires. Baseball, more so than football or basketball, is thought to be a game of individual achievement masquerading as a team effort. Beane's theories of playing the game changes all the rules in that what you do in your turn at bat and on the bases has a much greater impact on runs scored than previously thought and puts a premium on team play rather than individual glory. And wouldn't that be refreshing...thinking that players are really interested in the team and not just themselves. <br />    If only one team has won more regular season games than yours for the past three years, and at a much higher payroll, (Atlanta's Braves) and if your team leads all other MLB teams in second-half,(post July 31st trading deadline) victories, it must be recognized that you are doing something extraordinarily right. The only logical conclusion is that you have recognized talent, acquired it, and are maximizing those skills to the utmost and in a fashion that is making the big spenders look foolish.<br />Kudos to Mr. Lewis. This is the baseball book I've been waiting for and my only disappointment is that, as with all great books,it seems to end all too soon.

No one can argue that the man is not only an accomplished artist but a living piece of art. He's all about self expression. About having the guts enough to follow your dreams and not giving a damn about what other people think. He's everything most people wish they could be. Anyone having doubts that this book won't give you the information you're looking for, doubt no more. It will take you to the edge crying for more.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Upon hearing Drunkship of Lanterns on mp3.com, I immediately knew I had to buy this album.  The Mars Volta enables the listener to embark upon a journey through Julio's unconscious, but you find yourself journeying through your own mind while listening to DITC.  Tracks such as Eriatarka move you more than any other song; in short, this CD is amazing.  Once listeing to it the first time through, you feel enlightened.  Play it again, the journey continues and discover what a great CD can do to you.
0316666343|3.0|I'd waited quite a while to get my hands on this one.  I borrowed it from a friend and read it in 2 sittings so it's quite a fast read.  I loved the beginning and the set up.  It's quite exciting to be able to have the omniscient point of view from the start.  The device to have the narrator a deceased girl looking down from heaven is really clever.  Also, I loved the ideas the author has about heaven.  <br />I believe the problem with the book is that it doesn't know what it wants to be... a novel about picking up the pieces after a violent death in the family... or a serial killer story and consequentially, it does neither very well.  And then we have the ending... so silly, so incredible, so inappropriate... for me, it ruined the joys of the first part.  I would never go as far as saying that it's not worth reading... but after such a great start, I do confess to be very disappointed in the end.
B00009V7RF|4.0|This will be a really short review, I thought I'd give something better than the previous reviews from the person who apparently knows no grammer. The cd isn't bad, with the exception of the stupid lyurics for \\"let's get retarded\\"- which otherwise, has some good beats. Just don't try downloading any of the songs because you'll probably just get some song with the lyrics \\"where is the love?\\" repeating itself over and over again...
B000083E79|5.0|I don't think Cher will ever be accused of being a great singer... but style, bravado, and a fierce charm makes her such a draw.  I have most all of Cher's albums but this one is great because now I have the majority of her best songs one one disc.  It's great and I listen to it all the time.  If you love Cher, then you will love this collection.
B00000ILDE|4.0|A film is edited to become a better than originally set. A lot of footage is cut to make sure the film isn't overly long, or unneccesary. <br /> It was neat that we saw the scenes where the Jordan family,  goes to see the derelict ship. Aside from all of the terrific acting in the film, I didn't care for the acting IN THIS PART. The actors that made up the rest of the family there were not bad....just weak, and well, \\"there\\". Aside from that, the scene cut down the mystery factor and gave any first time watchers to ready themselves. I much prefer the THEATRICAL release. Loved the sheer terror factor that SLOWLY unrolled into the movie. Nobody in the colony. All missing. No transmissions. No reasons. Yet. Much more eeriness. Also, almost anything else added was just HONESTLY WEAK. But if you saw any other movie (even your all time favourites) unedited, you'd see a few weak acted scenes too, or even a part that you may not want to know-you want it to be a funny joke, or mystery. See?<br /> The only parts that were MORE THAN DESERVING to be kept in this movie were as follows: <br />-Ripley's daughter died in her 60's. Burke brought her the info and a photo last taken. Very touching and it didn't interfere with the depth or mystery later.<br />-All the scenes of the sentry weapons - setup, test, and both battles between the weapons and the \\"BUGS\\"...haha.<br />-The quick snip of Ellen (Ripley) saying a temporary goodbye to Dwayne (Hicks). Neat how she seems to introduce her first name. wearing a bold face for such a simple thing. A cute insecurity of hers.  They've known each other by their last names, and now it gets more personal. <BR>And Hicks gives his first name with a smile, like telling her in a kind way not to be shy about it. (but ,okay, okay Ellen-uh-Ripley- don't just stand there-go get Newt!)<br />-Hudson introducing to Ripley the detail of weapons that the United States Colonial Marines carry. Glad Hudson was the one to do so. He's awesome and always full ofverbal volume. Ha-ha. Drake would have done a knockout job too!<br />ALIENS is the best movie I'll ever own. This Special Edition was neat...yet I only am half grateful due to the FEW parts that were deserving to be added. The rest, well, as Drake would say (running backwards with Vasquez and blasting their smartguns at theose bugs, covering Hicks and Hudson's escape) <BR>\\" RAT  BUGGERS !!!\\"
B00003CXI1|4.0|I had never been so hyped about a book becoming a movie until the Harry Potter series.  I was surprised to see how close the movie was to the book, though it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen.<BR>The acting among the younger group wasn't too bad, but the legends such as Richard Harris and Alan Rickman were remarkable, making their characters come to life.  The special effects weren't that impressive--the Quidditch scenes were cool, but a little too obvious that they weren't real.  And the troll in the girls' bathroom...well...that speaks for itself.  In spite of that, it was a great movie that anyone of any age can enjoy.<br />The one thing I must rant about is the bonus features disc.  It might be appealing to a younger child who enjoys games, but for an older person who is looking for behind-the-scenes features, this is not it.  The entire disc is mostly a game where you go to Diagon Alley to buy your wand and such and it's nearly impossible to find the deleted scenes.  Also, the 15-minute interview with the crew wasn't worth the time to watch.  But, then again, a kid who enjoys playing games would find the bonus features entertaining.
B00007G207|3.0|The original Cinema Paradiso is my favorite movie. It's perfect and sweet. This new version adds length and lessens the story and characters. It makes Alfredo look like a bad guy, and worse, it makes Toto look like a loser/stalker in the end. A couple of icky sex scenes are thrown into this version as well--again taking away the sweet innocence of the original. Somehow the characters in the theater aren't as important in this version, and the destruction of the theater at the end loses its poignancy. Very disappointing. I'm buying the original before it gets too hard to find. It's a shame they didn't put the original version on this disc as well.
B00005O5CM|4.0|When I heard of this movie, I automatically thought of a stereotypical chick flick.  I was right about the chick flick part, but I really enjoyed this movie.  I found it hilarious in some parts with a somewhat believable storyline to it.  This is a very entertaining movie with plenty of laughs.  (Now I can't wait until I see the sequel...)
B00005RZV4|5.0|OK guys, I agree, this is an awesome concert. But don't buy it. Buy the Deluxe Edition with the bonus disc &quot;Still.&quot; That's the only way to get &quot;Still,&quot; which is pretty much an album by itself. It contains all original material which you cannot obtain any other way, 4 softer versions of previously released NIN songs and FIVE SONGS YOU CANNOT GET ON ANY OTHER CD. So basically if you like NIN, you're going to want that disc, and if you get this version, you're going to have to either buy And All That Could Have Been twice or just not get &quot;Still&quot; at all. So in conclusion, get the Deluxe Edition instead.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Being an obsessive Potter fan like myself, I've been worried about the movies doing the books no justice like some book-to-movie transitions I've seen.  In Chamber of Secrets, I've found little to complain about.<BR>Unlike the first film with the tedious character introductions, this one jumps right into the story.  The darker tone of the film reflects the book's tone perfectly.  The acting has improved--especially the talents of Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Richard Harris surely will be missed playing the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.  Kenneth Branagh is perfectly casted as the narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall) yet again give excellent performances.<BR>The special effects have improved tremendously--the Quidditch sequences look amazing and the Basilisk scene is enjoyably frightful.  There is hardly anything bad about the movie, except for the bland ending and the way the movie seems a little &quot;choppy&quot; with the changes in the scenes.<BR>Anyone--whether you've read the books or not--will find this movie very enjoyable.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I must admit that I was an early fan of The Mars Volta only because of the At the Drive-In split. However, as upset as I was about the end of ATDI, hearing `De-Loused in the Comatorium' made me realize the separation was just a blessing in disguise - it allowed ex-ATDI members Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez to dedicate their full-time to The Mars Volta. As much as I loved ATDI, their sound had always been reminiscent of Fugazi's intense guitars and searing voice. With TMV's `Tremulant EP' and now `De-Loused', Bixler and Rodriguez, along with Ikie Owens, Jon Theodore, Juan Alderete, and Jeremy Ward (R.I.P), were able to combine punk, prog, synth, early emo, space, blues, and jazz (alongside many other styles) into an inventive and distinctive sound; independent from their previous band.<br />Where the majority of ATDI's songs had overriding vocals and guitar riffs (which sometimes seemed obligatory), The Mars Volta is much more melodic and harmonious, having a strong control of the heavy guitars and vocals and when to include them - using them in a way that makes their songs flow. <br />Their new harmonious sound can be heard right in the beginning of De-Loused. <BR>The spacy, mellow minute and a half opener, \\"Son et Lumiere\\", would most likely be a shock to ATDI-turn-TMV fans looking for `Relationship of Command 2'. Its soft melody and surprisingly harmonious (but distorted) voice of Bixler make for an intriguing opener. Towards the end of the song, an addition of a fierce drumbeat is introduced, which inspires anticipation. However, instead of lengthening the opener, the beat instead flows into a different song, \\"Inertiatic ESP\\". This transition streams into \\"Inertiatic ESP\\", keeping the beat, but changing the tune - which shows their ability to control sound. Being an early song on the album, it introduces the vocal strength. Instead of the high-pitched screams that Bixler fans are accustomed to, in \\"Inertiatic ESP\\", the song shows the range and force of his voice. He is able to keep long notes, as well range from high to low - which is stunning. <br />\\"Roulette Dares (This is the Haunt)\\" starts with fast, heaving guitars and a fierce beat, but slowly transitions to a much softer, almost ballad-like tune, where Bixler's soft, beautiful vocals (which he never presented in ATDI) make the song rather soothing. Within the song, there is a rise-drop backbone, where the fast, lush sound transitions to the soft melody and back again, continuing the cycle. Through all the contrasting sounds, their control of transitioning helps make the song flow. <br />\\"Tira Me A Las Aranas\\" is an entirely instrumental song, but instead of having a loud cacophony of sounds, they keep it simple and unhurried, using a distorted guitar riff as the base and incorporating a diverse variety of sounds to make it simple, yet elaborate. As with the opening, where \\"Son et Lumiere\\" flowed into \\"Inertiatic ESP\\", \\"Tira Me a Las Aranas\\" does the same to \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\". Where \\"Tira\\" was slow and simple, \\"Drunkship\\" has an incredibly fast and ornate sound. \\"Drunkship's\\" hundreds of different ornate sounds come together to create a single, beautiful melody, giving the song the full sound it has to attract first time listeners (which is probably why it is the best song to release as their first single). The contrast from the two songs, that somehow is able to flow into one another, help to emphasize the full sound of \\"Drunkship\\". <br />Their ability to control contrasting sounds can again be heard in \\"Eriatarka\\". It begins with a fast drumbeat, but ends quickly and transitions to a haunting, distorted melody behind Bixler's again soothing voice. As with \\"Roulette\\" (though they sound completely different), \\"Eriatarka\\" also has a rise-drop backbone, which helps to emphasize the contrasts and transitions to give it its complete sound.<br />Their control of music can be most distinguished in \\"Cicatriz ESP\\", where the seven minute, vocal-free interlude in themiddle of the song displays the band's instrumental talent. The most striking part of the interlude is towards its end, where it takes on a salsa-like approach. Following \\"Cicatriz ESP\\" is \\"This Apparatus Must be Unearthed\\", whose distorted tune make it tense and angsty, but not forceful. <br />The album concludes with \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\", which is the perfect closer. The song \\"lays their cards on the table\\". It has a sample of all that The Mars Volta is, starting with a fast, catchy beat, transitioning to a softer, more melodic sound, then to a striking guitar solo which flows into a distorted, memorable tune, and finally ends with a flowing transitional cacophony of different sounds. <br />However, the most notable (not necessarily the `best', but notable) track on `De-Loused' is \\"Televators\\". The ballad is unlike anything Rodriguez and Bixler have previously been a part of (from both ATDI and De Facto). It showcases Bixler's newly-trained melodic voice over a shockingly beautiful, mellow tune with a jazzy, salsa finesse. And yet, though ballad-like, the spacy, prog-rock sound gives it the signature TMV flair.<br />Beyond their music, they still manage lyrically to keep their elegance in poetry. Though, let's face it, half (or more) of the lyrics are hardly understandable to the general public, they are neither trite nor stale. Also, when compared to `Tremulant' or later ATDI, `De-Loused' is much more graspable.<br />`De-Loused in the Comatorium' is, in a way, a musical maturity from previous already-exceptional efforts. Being a newly released album, it's taken its hold on me, being so captivating, that in less than a week, I have already been familiarized to it. The music that TMV are able to present in their full-length debut is extraordinary, to say the least. Their inclusion of different sounds and control over different styles and genres help make their album one of the (if not the) best in 2003 - and helps put The Mars Volta in a league of their ownamongst their peers.

B000099T2L|5.0|This album is going to be a classic in my collection. I've just finished listening to this album and I'm soo impressed.  As a Destiny's child fan, I didn't expect too much from Beyonce all though I'm very fond of her. However, Beyonce proved that her range is limitless and I appreciate the various styles that she incorporated in this album!! Some of my personal favourites include:<br /> <BR>3. Baby Boy- (Feat. Sean Paul)-4/5<BR>This song blends dancehall and r&b and it's done perfectly. I was never a fan of Dancehall and r&b being mixed but this track reveals that when done well, the product is excellent.  <BR>5. Be With You -4/5<BR>Another ballad that I'm feelin' lyrically and <BR>6. Me, Myself And I-5/5        <BR>As a female, it's a song that I can really get into. It has an old school feel to it.  I can relate to this song based on friendships moreso than romantic relationships.<BR>7. Yes-4/5<BR>Very sexy        <BR>8. Signs (Feat. Missy Elliott)-4/5<BR>Very unique and creative song.          <BR>9. Speechless-5/5<BR>This song left me speechless. It's such a soulful ballad and I can really feel it.          <BR>10. That's How You Like It (Feat. Jay-Z)-5/5        <BR>11. The Closer I Get To You (Duet With Luther Vandross)-5/5<BR>Such a beautiful song and remade lovely.        <BR>12. Dangerously In Love 2-5/5              <BR>14. Gift From Virgo-4.5/5  <BR>Bonus: Daddy-4/5<br />This album surely surpassed my expectations.  I wasn't feeling her initial single 'work it' and I expected songs like this on her album since she said she wanted to experiment on this album.  However, she doesn't limit herself vocally or stylistically. She definitely has grown and matured and you can see it on this album.  In addition, the music doesn't have that 'pop' feel to it like I initially expected(I'm glad I was wrong). It's a real soulful, r&b album and timeless in my opinion.  That's what makes this album a classic in my book. If you're lover of real r&b, cop this album!
0780020685|5.0|This movie is an all time classic.  It can be viewed as a straight action movie, but has many subtleties that reward repeated watching:  there's a subtext on how being a Samurai is more than just being a warrior, there are complex relationships between all the major farmer and Samurai characters, there are illustrations of how the Samurai, farmers, and bandits all shaped each other in 16th century Japan, and much more.  While the movie is substantially longer than the typical Hollywood release, there's enough going on that it never drags.<br />The DVD version has a substantially cleaner and better picture than the VHS tape version in almost all scenes.  Because the movie is black and white, making the DVD video compression more efficient, the entire three and a half hour movie fits onto one disc.  The original was not a wide screen release, so the full screen edition captures the entire picture from the original.<br />If you have a DVD player, the DVD version is definitely worth the extra few bucks.  If you don't have a DVD player, you might consider buying one just to watch this movie.
B00004XONN|4.0|Everything is in its right place- This is the first song on the album and one of my favorites. The synth swells in the biginning nearly liquify the mind. Not a standout track but very good. 8/10<br />Kid A- Very cool opening and I love the white noise part towards the middle/end. Still not a stand out track. 7/10<br />The National Anthem- Probably the best song on the disc the pounding bass and pyscsophrenic horns mixed with the vocorderd(?)screeches of Yorke are increatable. Stand out track. 10/10<br />How to disapear completly- Another stand out track. Breath taking syths and simple guitar struming works great. The bassline is steady and powerful. Similar in acoustic/syth spookiness to Fake plasic trees but a great song none the less. 8.5/10<br />Treefinges- Too boring for my taste and it's a little to pretentious and long, the only skipper on the album. 2/10<br />Optamistic- Great song by itself but belongs on the bends of Hail to the Thief more than kid a. 9/10 stand alone 6/10 on the album because it breaks the mood.<br />In Limbo- Filler in terms of the album but would be stand out if it were on anything else. A little to similar to Everything is in its right place for me. 7.5/10<br />Idioteque- Ever since i heard the keyboard part of this song on SNL in 2000 it's been haunting me. Great track and a stand out 10/10<br />Morning bell- Great haunting song but not as increatable as some of the tracks. 8/10<br />Motion Picture Soundtrack- When Thome sings \\"I think your crazy/Maybe\\" it is one of the greatest moments in music. The harp stuff takes away from the original acoustic balled but that moment alone warrents a Ten. 10/10
B000002UJQ|5.0|Anyone who reviews this album and says it's not POP enough and you can't dance to it obviously shouldn't be listening to it in the first place.  If empty-headed dance tracks are what you are into, buy Brittney Spears, buy Madonna, buy Duran Duran.  I don't think Radiohead set-out to get the world dancing with the music on this album.  However, if you want to kick off your dance shoes and put down the beer bong and leave the frat party, this might be the album for you.  For me, it's the best album Radiohead has done, it's certainly the best album of 1997 and it's Top 10, maybe Top 5, of the 90's.  It is absolutely an essential rock album.  Of course, it's no N'Sync.
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu came on to the music scene with a vengance in 1997 with the hits &quot;On &amp; On&quot; and &quot;Appletree.&quot;  I first heard this disc at a friend's house and they let me have it. Now I love it and it's one of my favorite CD's. Erykah's voice is truly unique and she is a very gifted songwriter as well.  While many compare her to classic singers such as Billie Holiday, Erykah really is distinct enough to be classified in her own style.  The music on here is very intelectual.  If you don't like digital-produced music such as TLC and Destiny's Child then you'll like Baduizm, an acoustic R&amp;B feel.  My favorite song is &quot;Certainly&quot; because it has a catchy hook and I also love &quot;4 Leaf Clover.&quot;  If you loved the hits &quot;On And On&quot; as well as &quot;Appletree&quot; then pick up Erykah's debut.  I also reccomend &quot;The Misseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (Former Fugee's member).
B00008NG5V|5.0|better album than brushfire overall.  it flows better with a cleaner sound, and has those standout tracks that define an album.  however, the best part about this album is mediocre bad guys, because it is simply the best song ever recorded.  yeah, it's that good.  other standouts: taylor, times like these, rodeo clowns, tomorrow morning.  worst track: the horizon has been defeated.
B0000931OG|2.0|this is the second time blur has recorded an album without having a set of completed songs to work on.  the sound effects, tricks, and gimmicks can't hide that damon has at least temporarily lost his muse.  he is reaching out for other textures in an attempt to make up for it, but it isn't really fooling that many people.  coxton's harder edged musicality is sorely missed.  they shold hire jonny marr or someone of similar clout to give them a new voice and a new focus.  alex and dave are obviously just enjoying the relatively easy ride of being in blur these days.  there is no real musical tension on this record which is why it never really goes anywhere.  I love blur and i have seen them live in nyc, philly, seatle (on this new tour) and winston salem.  i have preached the gospel of blur to anyone who would listen.  let me implore to damon---------take your risks, but never forget how to write a good song.  that is your greatest gift.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This in my mind is the greatest album ever created.  It is simply flawless.  I can honestly say every track is a &quot;standout track&quot;. But personal favorittes are &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;let down&quot;, &quot;Exit Music&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and &quot;No suprises&quot;.  These songs cover the range of the whole cd also.  Radiohead has always produced great cds,  but this one stands out even for them.  It has the perfect blend of heavy guitar and electronics, to acoustic guitar and piano.  Thom Yorke's extremely emotional singing can bring one to tears.Any music fan should own this album.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail to the Thief can be most easily represented by a splicing of Radiohead's two more notable albums--Kid A and OK Computer.  While both Amnesiac and Kid A often feel too experimental and brief, Hail to the Thief is gritty and listenable.  Though the band does often give into experimentation, no entire song is devoted to (or wasted by) ambient background noise (&quot;Treefingers&quot;), robotic murmuring (&quot;Kid A&quot;) or any other form of wacky musical adventure.  However, the album is refreshing and unique, thanks to the presence of unconventional instruments, samples, song structure, lyrics, and of course, Thom Yorke's signature vocals.  Here, they're more unpredictable, and less mainstream than on any of the band's earlier work.  Expect to be genuinely surprised and satisfied by the variety and complexity of the material.<br />For the most part, Radiohead have departed from the lush, more wistful mood of &quot;The Bends,&quot; into something much more cerebral and harrowing.  Thankfully, this metamorphosis doesn't go nearly as far as in Amnesiac or Kid A, which means that you won't be skipping tracks, because all of these are &quot;real&quot; songs.  And while electronic sound effects and other synthetic instrumentation are more present than on OK Computer, Radiohead have been moderate in their implication, and thus, refined their sound expertly.  The electronic beats and blips can be used as a steady beat/baseline for a song such as in &quot;Idioteque&quot; (&quot;Backdrifts&quot;), used sparingly for a subtle effect (&quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;) or applied substantially to produce something unpredictable, yet amazing (&quot;Myxomatosis&quot;).<br />Whatever the case, Hail to the Thief pleases on all levels, and I cannot imagine any Radiohead fan being disappointed by it.  Though I doubt anyone will claim it as their new favorite, no one can sneer at the care taken in combining the multiple sounds which Radiohead have created for themselves in a masterful collection of melancholy and wonder.
0790737345|3.0|I liked the movie but it was a hard one to swallow. It really makes you think about the way life works.
0441009425|4.0|Alastair Reynolds' first book \\"Revelation Space\\" is well worth the read!  Taking place far far in the future you have a story full of spies, cyborgs, aliens and all the hi-tech you can imagine.  An epic that spans time and space, is truly thought provoking. The characters are well drawn and memorable.  Easily, this novel would be considered \\"hard sci-fi\\" as it is in league with Gene Wolfe, China Mieville and Eric Nylund.  In this story, one scientist named Dan Sylveste has made an arecheological discovery with far reaching implications of galactic proportions.  As Dan Sylveste closes in on the answer to the mystery of the disapperance of the Amarantin peoples, an assasin lies hidden ready to strike.  The story moves along but gets hung up at the end with too many unanswered questions and begs the sequel (Chasm City). The book deserves a rating of 3.5 stars where the benefits of the book outweighs the chaos at the end. A good purchase nonetheless. Enjoy... Makes you want to get an implant!
B000083C49|5.0|This is a fine effort, even with some obvious scientific flaws such as capturing photons from a ship's reactor.<br />The previous reviewer's comments about the music are totally wrong.  This score of Leonard Rosenman was nominated for an Academy Award, and the film has very, very inventive music throughout--everything from technopop (YellowJackets in the San Francisco scene) to contemporary art composers such as Pendereski.
0380820498|2.0|As far as police procedurals go, this is sort-of ok.  For my taste though, the characters are a little flat and too one dimensional.  I could not get through this bland piece of soft-boiled prose and had to put it down unfinished. I found Banks and his companions very wooden and not believable. Excluding the victim, there was not enough to go on to feel any true sympathy for the other characters.  The plot line IS interesting but gets to a point of being turgid. Perhaps I'll give it another try someday.
B000005AYM|5.0|This is one amazing debut album for Erykah. She just blew me away! It took me a few listens to get used to her style, but after that, I was addicted.<BR>Track after track it just gets better and better. I have so many favorites. 'Certainly', 'Drama', &amp; 'No Love' are just a few of them. Not to forget 'Apple Tree'. You gotta love them lyrics. <br />&quot;If you don't wanna be down with me, then you don't need to pick from my apple tree.&quot; <br />Yeah Erykah, you go girl!
0789723107|5.0|Wow.  Steve manages to write a book that follows his usability principles for websites down to a key.  It was very practical.  One of the easiest books I've ever read.  I enjoy Steve's writing style, which dispenses with &quot;Happy talk&quot; and gets down and dirty, while still maintaining a comfortable approach to usability.<br />This book made me think about my users.  Instead of walking away from this book feeling like a complete dolt for not implementing user testing beforehand, or reflecting on poorly designed websites over the years that feel prey to some of the common mistake he pointed out, I felt empowered to make changes and even begin user testing as early as this week.<br />In a nutshell, Steve tells you how to recognize it's broken, and how to fix it, and come in well under budget.
0385504209|4.0|I found it distracting in his obvious agenda/bias re the Roman Catholic Church.  Not that it is an inappropriate one, it just seems to be a thread woven in two of his books I've recently read.<br />Putting that aside the book is great and the premise possible, and it's tightly written.  Hard to put down as you want to find out what is coming next!<br />I shall continue to buy Mr. Brown's work and I recommend his work on my own web site.<br />He's educational too about arcane and archaic thoughts/theories without being pendantic.  One's sense of history is enlarged by reading Mr. Brown's book.  His fiction does seem to be based on facts in my opinion.
1883217040|5.0|Mark Levine's book is perfect. He explains clearly how to play jazz from examples from the jazz pioneers. He also is able to make the theory behind the concepts exciting. This book along with Scott Miller's &quot;Getting Into Jazz Fusion Guitar&quot; have increased my understanding of jazz 80 fold.
0393057658|4.0|As a lifelong Oakland Athletics fan, the release of a new nonfiction work focused on the franchise's recent success is exciting.  When the book chooses to examine the role played by general manager and resident genius, Billy Beane, Moneyball becomes an instant must-read.  Michael Lewis' peak into the inner workings of the Oakland Athletics ventures from biography to economic study to experimental statistical analysis.  Overall, Moneyball exposes Billy Beane's philosophy on baseball, and as entertaining and insightful as it may be, it makes this fan cringe as the secrets to the Oakland A's success are revealed to all those who might read this book.  Yet, luckily enough, Lewis points out one other thing about professional baseball: new ideas are unwelcome in an institution of tradition, making Beane's unorthodox means safe in a world of conformity, for now.<br />Early in Moneyball, Lewis reveals the failed career of a young prospect out of San Diego.  An athlete so gifted in ability, \\"Billy flat-out smoked\\" his competition and earned the title of \\"the Good Face,\\" a can't-miss prospect that whose talent even showed in his charismatic mug.  However, Beane's potential would never be fully realized, leading to a failed big-league career and a life of self-doubt masked in his perfectionism.<br />As Beane made the transition from player to front-office administrator, the world of statistical analysis forever changed his views on baseball.  Lewis spends several chapters exploring the emergence of Bill James, author of a series of books called The Baseball Abstracts.  James was intrigued by the statistical nature of baseball, but found flaws in the basic book-keeping of America's pastime.  James created his own methods of tracking the events of a typical baseball game, and he concluded that the standard measures of success, batting average, home runs, runs-batted-in, and stolen bases, failed to accurately capture the effectiveness of a specific player.  James wrote his booksannually, each year expanding the scope of his study, and with each volume, converting more baseball fans to his way of thinking.  One of them was Billy Beane.<br />Lewis touches on several interesting success stories in Beane's unorthodox style.  Jeremy Brown, the \\"fat catcher\\" drafted in the first round by the A's when no other team even thought of wasting a pick on the kid, who now hits better than most players in the minors.  Scott Hatteberg, a damaged and discarded catcher of the Boston Red Sox becomes the first baseman for the A's, somehow replacing the irreplaceable Jason Giambi.  Then there is Chad Bradford, the dominant submariner relief pitcher, who found himself plucked from minor league purgatory when the Chicago White Sox failed to see the same talent in person that Beane and Depodesta only saw in a spreadsheet.  Each case further supports Beane's notion that the right statistics found on a computer screen can tell much more than gut instincts of a baseball mind.<br />Yet, there is something unsettling about the new model of baseball that Beane embraces so happily.  Beane never watches his team, the perfectionist instead works out during games or drives aimlessly in circles around the Oakland Coliseum parking lot.  The manic quest for success is met with unbridled anger when the potential fails to become reality, and every pitch, not game, becomes a potential trigger for a Beane outburst.  Along the same lines, Beane seems to believe every player is simply a piece to a never-ending puzzle.  Thus, stars such as Giambi, may be replaced by cheaper options such as Hatteberg.  In essence, when a player has outgrown the simple confines of Oakland, their replacements are welcomed quickly without missing a beat.  It is heartbreaking to realize that Miguel Tejada, MVP shortstop will suffer the same fate as Giambi and not be re-signed after this season.  Yet for Beane, its another opportunity to gain two more first round draft picks and grab the unwanted dregs ofthe amateur talent pool.  Another opportunity to prove himself right and everyone else wrong.<br />Lewis also reveals the nuances involved in one the most basic facets of baseball, trading players.  As the trading deadline looms, Oakland's fanatical general manager feeds his urge to upgrade his team.  Yet, staying true to form, Beane never sacrifices his own talent pool to pull off these season-altering transactions.  The mastermind rolls up his sleeves and begins the psychological warfare worthy of military recognition, simultaneously creating self-doubt and overconfidence in his peers, leading them to make the moves that he wanted while allowing them to believe he is at their mercy.  The acquisition of Ricardo Rincon, a quality relief pitcher, is an amusingly vicious experience as Beane manipulates the marketplace to accommodate his needs.<br />Lewis' exploration into the world of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics is an interesting ride.  As a biography, Lewis never delves deeply enough into Beane's character, only brushing the surface of a self-imposed tragic figure.  As a study in the economics of baseball, Lewis barely examines anything beyond the Oakland A's drafting philosophy.  And as an analysis of the franchise's success, the book only touches on Billy Beane's role in structuring a team, never getting into the on-field performance of the stars Beane helped groom.  Yet, taken as a whole, Moneyball serves to paint a picture of how Beane came to represent such consistent success despite playing a game built for only the richest of owners.  Michael Lewis delivers an entertaining read, even if it never gets beyond the surface of the topics he covers.  For this at-bat, Moneyball receives a solid double, nothing overwhelming, but a fun ride to hop on nonetheless.
B000089RVX|5.0|I brought this CD through Amazon.com before it was released in New Zealand. I had downloaded some songs and I loved them, so wasn't going to wait a month for it to come out, even though it would have been about $25 cheaper. Her voice is amazing, and the mixture of instruments work really well. Every one of their songs has the potential to be as big as \\"BRing me to Life\\". Excellent CD. The only downside is that they didn't include \\"Forgive me\\" in their CD.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The series is a great show, I love how you get to see how Clark became Superman. I think the stories are new and interesting and I think it's great the way they show how Clark and Lex were such great friends in the begining. I also like the love triangle of Clark, Cloe and Lana. I thought it was strange that the WB said no flying for Clark until I rewatched an episode of Lois and Clark in it Clark told Lois that he didn't fly untill after high school. I can hardly wait untill the series in on DVD.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I came across this cd by accident while browsing on Amazon, after haering the samples I thought I must purchse it. I did and it was worth every cent. From start to finish \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\" is perfect and it did not leave my cd player for weeks. If you like music that has the ability to create an image in your mind then this is the cd for you. Do yourself a favour and buy it.
0385334206|3.0|I wrote a review of this book a few weeks ago, and it still hasn't shown up on amazon, so I thought that I'd have another go at it.<br />The gist of my first review was that I thought that this book was entertaining and added much depth into the character of Kilgore Trout.  The story was amusing and the pictures were interesting, yet sometimes seemed to be used just to take up space.<br />But there was one main bad part of this novel: it overplayed the race card.  I'm not saying that Vonnegut is himself racist, and do believe that he was using the issue in a satrical way, but it just went overboard.  The N-bomb was dropped way too many times and all of the black characters in the novel were sterotypical.  The novel's attempted humor is not akin to the type used in, say, Blazing Saddles; instead, it just seemed like bigotry.<br />As a white man, I think the novel assumes a racist attitude.  There are countless other books that deal with race much better, including Native Son, Invisible Man, and even The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which really does not seem very similar to this book.<br />I liked the book, but it is just whimisical.  If it actually seemed that Vonnegut was trying to make a clear cutting point about race relations, then I wouldn't be so hard on him.  Unfortunately though, this theme never seems to precipitate, and the novel ends without making any dominant statement.  The book is interesting, but ultimately shouldn't be classified as the \\"great literature\\" that some believe it to be.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is a very together album of the Beatles at the end, and although it is perhaps dominated by Paul McCartney(especially side 2) it is still some of the best music played by all the Beatles, some of which is actually written by John(Come Together), George(Something and Here Comes The Sun) and even Ringo's best(Octopus Garden). So although Paul dominates the activity, the other guys provide some of the better tunes, which is what by definition is what makes up a great Beatles album--each member taking up for the weaknesses of the others and the group turing out a superior effort. <br />That is what this and most other Beatles albums are: Superior in most ways to every other Rock album being released during, and following that period of time, and that's why probably all of their albums deserve 5 stars, at least when compared to other Rock albums. Do I sound biased? The only thing that made me that way would have to be the music itself. This is a true classic!
0060012218|5.0|I was hooked by about page ten, and I loved every minute of this book. I've read my share of \\"young adult\\" fiction (I'm a high school teacher), and I have yet to read a story as compelling as this one. The themes are universal and the characters are so real that I think anyone who is--or has been--a teenager will bond with them instantly.

B00005JKES|5.0|This is arguably the greatest Television program in history. You don't have to take my word for it, I don't really agree with this, but if it is not the best, it is definetely one of the best.<BR>If you love a great story you'll love this and if you don't then you'll love it anyway.<BR>Twin Peaks is fantastic. The script and story was adapted from the short book \\"The secret diary of Laura Palmer\\" and it was done to the best it possibly could have been.<BR>David Lynch is not fully responsible for the birth of this great television series, however he is the person most talked about for being part of it.<BR>The episodes he directs all seem so real that you feel like you know the town of twin peaks and the people in it. He is a genius when it comes to directing, and it certainly shows in this.<BR>The series is perfectly orchestrated, you will never get bored, you will be biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat, It's funny where necassery and the cliffhangers will leave you desperate for more.<BR>Do yourself a favour and buy this. You won't regret it and you will also decrease the treacherously long gap that is constantly increasing over the production of season 2.<BR>So save your money, put any ideas about getting season 8 and 9 of The X Files on hold (forever), don't bother with the latest dragged out and hollow Buffy seasons and buy this. It's brilliant!<BR>The story follows the unravelling of the mystery of Laura Palmers death. Thier are many twists and turns along the way that surprisingly never lose thier tension and appeal when you watch them more than once.(Unlike 24)<BR>                            <BR>                            P.S<BR>I reccomend getting your hands on the English version since it contains the pilot episode that the U.S version doesn't. It is overpriced (Just like everything else in my crappy country) but it is the best version you can get.<BR>If you do take my advice and buy either the English or U.S version DO NOT WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES if you havn't seen all of the show before.<BR>Whoever designed the set left in features that give away major twists that happen much later in the show. Take my advice on this, you will be very angry at whoever designed this set if you watch them and haven't seen all of twin peaks before. (They aren't very good special features anyway)<BR>I hope this review has been useful, now scroll back to the top of the page, and click buy.

B00008DDXC|5.0|A great sequel to the first film.  The actors are much more confident in their roles and the performances of Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermoine), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), and Jason Issacs (Lucius Malfoy) were particullary excellent.  The Herbology lesson with Prof. Sprout soon after the return to Hogwarts was memorable and the Quidditch match alone makes this worth the money for the DVD.  Unlike the match in the first movie where you could pick out some of the computer animation, this time it looks like they actually flew broomsticks in front of the camera and chased the snitch and everything!  The scenes with the spiders and the Baslisk were on a standard any action movie would be proud of and the scene of flying the Ford Anglia to the school is much more entertaining than in the books.  The only regrets about the movie is missing out on the Deathday Party, getting a greater sense of how alienated Harry was after the Dueling Club, and the Valentines Day fiasco that was so humerous in the book would have been a hoot to see on the screen.  The ending might be a little cheesy but forgivable considering how fast-paced and fun the rest of it was.  If only they re-inserted the deleted scenes I would say a perfect adoptation (it would have been great to have another Quidditch match too!...though there wasn't another one in the book).  A must for anyone, Potter follower or not!
0385504209|5.0|I'm more of a self help book reader than fiction.  But I do have my share of fictions.  My favorite author has been Tom Clancy.  Till now.  The Divinci Code boiles with suspense and makes you want to know more and more.  I think this tops any of my Clancy books.  As for the self help, The Little Guide To Happiness is and will always be my favorite.  Whatever your genre.  You can't go wrong here.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Ok I am a fan of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine. I thought a first when I heard of Chris Cornell joining with the remaining members of RATM that it would be Chris singing Rage songs. Well to those stubborn Rage and Soundgarden fans get over it this is not Soundagainstthemachine or Rage Against the Soundgarden. It is Audioslave and they are pretty damn good. I am glad the other members Brad and Tim were finally able to use thier skills more because Zach De La Rocha really kept them down from really showing off their skill especially with Tom Morello. <BR>Chris' voice is probally the best over the past 10 years he is an amazing vocalist and he really shines on Audioslaves first <BR>album. <BR>The songs are awesome my favorite track is \\"I am The Highway\\" all the songs are great except for the last track the album could have done without this. This was one of the better albums released in 2002 the other being Dredg's amazing sophmore album El Cielo.<BR>I for one am already eagerly awaiting thier next album and further efforts from Audioslave they have clearly have said <BR>they are here to stay.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The two former members from At The Drive-In Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (guitar) and Cedric Bixler Zavala (vocals) who went on to form The Mars Volta now have their first Debut album De-Loused in the Comatorium, which is the best album of 2003, and quite possibly one of the greatest of all time.   The entire album was inspired by the life of Julio Venegas, and old friend to At The Drive-In who took his life while they were practising.  An original idea that not only blew my mind, but raised my expectations of all new music.  De-Loused in the Comatorium is just not something you would bring with you to a gathering people, but an album that takes over your self-consciousness for the full hour that it lasts, and an hour well spent I might add.  After listening to De-Loused I felt changed, and inspired by this absorption of convolutions I had just experienced, with its wide range of complexity.  I am taken back to track 7: Cicatriz Esp, where you, like I, may flash back to the feeling of Led Zeppelin, with the wailing of the guitars and excellent drumming, while on track 10 Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt, I am reminded of the former band of Cedric and Omar, At The Drive-In.  There was help from some of The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Flea and Jon provide help, without their talent this album still would have been great, but with their excellence it just added to the overall greatness The Mars Volta has shown me in this experience!  I strongly recommend your purchase of this album.
B000009F3Z|5.0|This CD is simply amazing. If you are a fan of In Flames, Arch Enemy or Soilwork you will also love Dark Tranquillity. This is their 1995 release from Osmose Productions. If you can find this CD on Amazon or elsewhere, snatch it up before someone else does. It is that good. The guitars are amazing considering this is one of the groups's first albums. \\"Punish my Heaven\\", \\"Lethe\\" and \\"...Of melancholy burning\\" are excellent songs, but the whole CD is a technical masterpiece. There are few clean vocals, but this is the way Dark Tranquillity used to be, with all their ferocity and intensity. If you are a fan of death metal and you can find this CD for under $20, get it.

B000092ZYX|4.0|It certainly belongs to its time; an album of confusion and helplessness and rage and sadness and prevailing depth. A great album, without a doubt, especially in these times, when music has taken a dive for the worst (if you are a rock fan especially). I thouroughly enjoyed this record and I think it deserves more listens than I gave it before I rate it, but it didn't quite do what I hoped it might; bring back Ok Computer. <br />The rave about Hail to the Thief was that it might be the return of Radiohead's 1997 masterpiece, overshadowing two albums that veered off the path fans so desperately wanted more of. It's certainly a step in that direction compared to Kid A and Amnesiac, but I don't think it's quite there. There is a very negative ora presented by Hail to the Thief, whereas Ok Computer seemed much more of an open, deep feeling. In other words, it seemed to me more multidimensional than Hail to the Thief. But it is still a great record, and there are few if any albums that can be compared to Ok Computer. Definitley worth buying.
B00000JGHM|3.0|Heat did not have to be a lot of the things that it was, or have the things that it had. For instance, it didn't have to be three hours long. There were a lot of extra scenes that could have easily been left out, or cut shorter. Al Pacino did a great job (as always), and De Niro did well with what they gave him to work with, which wasn't great. Val Kilmer was not needed to play his part, as was the same situation with Ashley Judd's character, and with Jon Voight's. For a better Michael Mann film, see The Insider. Heat was fine to watch once. It had its good elements, but not enough to spend another three hours for a second viewing. It is not something that kids would enjoy, and its R rating is due to violence and language.
B00007K08H|5.0|Full of charming, simple, interwining stories, this movie will show all the various joys and small pleasures of life.<BR>This is the sort of movie that you will find many valuable quotes in,- they are characters who speak as if in a book. It was delightful, and I love how it was made, it was new and fresh. I liked the close ups and the music and I liked that brief segment where Amelie, on a thrill of harmony and goodwill after hearing Dominique Bredoteau's reaction to the finding of his childhood box in a bar, directs a blind man down a block and gives him eyes for a moment, in describing the delicious world to him.<BR>This is not the first foreign film I have seen. I have also seen Antonia's Line, and Burnt by the Sun, and I love all of these movies. Amelie is a very, very good movie. It's divine and lovely and you should watch it, and if you already have,- wasn't it wonderful?
0783225792|5.0|Casino is one of the most unforgettable films that I have ever seen. It would be hard to forget the performances, hard to forget the dialogue, and hard to forget the end. I think that Sharon Stone's academy award nomination for this was fully deserved, but it seemed that Joe Pesci went too overlooked for this. He was incredible in this film. He should have definitely at least earned himself a nomination for this one. Casino is 100% NOT a kid movie. Its R rating is extremely well-deserved, and due to strong brutal violence, pervasive strong language, some graphic drug use, and brief sexuality. Parts of this film will definitely leave the viewer with a sick stomach, especially with the fact that it was based on a true story. (I don't know how LOOSELY based it was though. Supposedly Scorcese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" was based on a true story, and it was a completely false depiction of Jesus' life.) If you don't mind the sinful lifestyles of each character (involving extreme greediness, substance abuse, violence and profanity), you are in for a genuine motion-picture experience. I recommend Casino to the strong-stomached.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is U2 at its best. This style, music, world changing album is fantastic, be sure to check it out.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Well, I'm a big fan of Madonna, but I have to admit that I am a little bit disappointed that this CD doesnt have any dance track all the previous do. Though, there are certainly great songs on this album, I Like (from most to least)<BR>- Hollywood<BR>- Intervention<BR>- Nothing Fails<BR>- I'm So Stupid<BR>- American Life<BR>- Die Another Day<BR>- Love Profusion<BR>The rest of it (Xstaticprocess,mother and father, easy ride, nobody knows me) I dont like it at all. This album somehow sounds personal, sad, but its Madonna, she has changed a lot, not like those cheap making money artist like Kylie, Dannie, Britney,...blah blah, shes has already done too much dance music, maybe this is her refresh with a couple of pure guitar songs, <BR>The vocoder effect is not overused in this album at all, (only \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" or \\"American Life\\"), her raw vocal is pretty much shown in here, and strong as well<br />The singles I hope she will release from this album are:<br />- American Life (already)<BR>- Hollywood (already)<BR>- Intervention (a very good song, honestly, great melody, accompaniment guitar)<br />thats it, no more, and hopefullly after the 2004 world tour, she will come back with another great album which is more \\"Madonna\\" than this one!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I love this movie and i love the soundtrack! I never knew these people could actually sing a song decently! Renee Zellweger was did really good, Richard Gere was suprisingly able to sing, and Catherine Zeta Jones. I cannot put into words how beautiful her voice is. I downloaded this cd after i saw it in theaters so i wasn't aware of the song Class (which i am downloading now) or I Move On. They are both awesome songs! These are my faves:<br />1. All That Jazz- It has a great beat and Catherine's voice is so beyond awesome.<BR>2.We Both Reached For The Gun- I crack up every time I hear this song! Its not that it has funny lyrics but Richard Gere trying to sound like a girl is hilarious! <BR>3. Roxie- I love the beat to this song. I also like Renee's voice. <BR>4. Cell Block Tango- Another song I cannot listen to without a laugh.<BR>5. Class- OH MY GOD! This song is SO FUNNY!!!!! Queen Latifah & Catherine sing so well together!The lyrics are so true!!!<BR>6.I Move On- I first heard this song at the Oscars, I like it it has really powerful lyrics if you <BR>really listen.<BR>7. I Cant Do It Alone: Great song. I love the part in the middle where Velma's like \\" I know your right the 1st parts shit\\" <br />This soundtrack will keep you singing & dancing. I am so glad I didnt dowload the extra songs with Macy Gray, I've heard them and they dont fit with the rest of the soundtrack at all! Anyways! This soundtrack rocks!! I suggest you buy the DVD (when its available), Chicago The Movie And Lyrics (which is a book) and of course this soundtrack!
B00005JL96|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Having spent several years in Hawaii, they were able to capture that which makes Hawaii special.  The songs written for the movie and the desire to keep the movie &quot;true&quot; to the Hawaiian way of life provides the great background.<br />The movie itself is destined to become a classic.  I can watch it weekly and it is still enjoyable.  The additional fact that they didn't try to make all the characters into &quot;barbie dolls&quot; is an added feature I find refreshing.  <br />If you get the DVD, take the time to review the added features.  Learn about the Islands (if you have never been there) and watch the children who perform &quot;Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride&quot; and the making of the movie.  Quite entertaining, also.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I love this movie & I've rated it a million times but i have only three things to say to you all. <br />1. People who are reviewing this and comparing it to Moulin Rouge, dont! Chicago & Moulin Rouge only have one thing in common and that is the fact they are musicals! But still Chicago's cast & singing is 110% better. <br />2. Why didn't they put the song Class in this movie! Omg it is so hilarious! You have to buy the soundtrack or download that song! I can't wait until the DVD comes out with that in the Deleted Scenes thing!<br />3. This is the best movie in the wHoLe wOrLd! It's a true classic and tOtAlLy deserved Best Picture. <br />Well i said only three things and even though I could go on about how wonderful this movie is, I wont.
B000002LR6|5.0|I bought this album somewhere around 7-8 years ago and have never stopped listening to it.  Truly ahead of its time at release.  Not to sound too unoriginal but my favorite cut has to be \\"Jesus Build My Hotrod.\\"  The CD really crosses borders between rock, metal and techno with a whole lot of energy.  Would highly recommend this disc as you can pick it up pretty cheap these days.
0066214122|4.0|Others have spoken to the quality of the plot, so I'll just add a note about the science. Evolutionary computation, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary biology are all real fields. They've had nothing like the success Crichton grants them, but they are useful, interesting techniques, with a lot of future potential. Crichton did his homework pretty well, and the end result never says anything that's really, utterly wrong. A real accomplishment, that. I can't really speak to the quality of the nanotech in the book, but as far as I know, that's a bit farther in the future than the software side of things he references. <br />FYI, I liked the book, but then, it's not every day I get to read a novel about my area of research, and find that it's not entirely wrong!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I bought the album two days ago, and have been listening to it over and over since then as long as I am awake. And for the moments that I am not listening to it, I am humming it, and wishing that I could be listening to it. I can't get enough of the album. It seems like with Hail To The Thief, Radiohead has figured out how to more evolve themselves in a way that people weren't expecting, but they will still enjoy. It is more structured than its two predecessors Kid A and Amnesiac, (although I enjoyed the boundless noise rock contained therein immensely) but it still has the loose eeriness of them. In my opinion Hail To The Thief is one of their best, right up there with OK Computer, and all the other musical genius that has flowed out of Radiohead in their artistic history. This album, like the others has important yet subtle comments to make, which I think is important. It is always better when a band has something to say, rather than just talking about a girl they want. Radiohead continues to be my favorite band, and as long as they are pumping out music, like drugs, I will (like a junkie) grab every piece of it I can and never get sick of it. Press on Radiohead! I promise that I will not fall ill to the Gloaming even if the rest of humanity is fighting a losing battle towards it. End transmission.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Forget the nay Seya's, this is one terrific album.  Yes I was hesitant to buy it after reading the negative reviews but after catching a sample of American Life on the radio I started to like it.  I thought what's wrong with this song?  Answer, nothing.  Its  upbeat and carries a good message.  As for the rapping, you go girl!  She does a good job and you can understand what she is rapping about.  Personally I think it suits her.  The rest of the songs are great; rarely do i press \\"skip\\" on my stereo.  Each song is either catchy or has something poignant to say.  Favorites include,<br />American Life, Nobody knows me, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails and Die another day.  However I feel that her most deepest song here has got to be X-static Process.  \\"I always wish I could find someone as talented as you but in the process I forgot I was just as good...\\" a great song that tells of loving one's self and not wanting to copy cat others even her.  Highly recommended.

B0000025OP|5.0|It is just too damn good not to spend some time listening too.
B000067J1H|5.0|From birth, we're always told that violence is wrong and fighting is not the way to solve problems. This film is one that examines violence not as a means of solving problems, but as a means of verifying your own existence. This movie dares to portray violence not as a completely horrible and ugly part of life, but as something that in some strange way has a sort of purity to it. Not that this movie says it's a good idea to go out and punch someone in the face, but it definitely does challenge you to think about a few things.<br />The film's story follows Jack (not his real name, but see the movie and you'll understand), an empty materialist insomniac who feels very depressed by his life in general. He works for an auto insurance company and spends most of his time and money building the perfect 21st century apartment, complete with all the essentials; IKEA furniture, a home exer-bike, a personal home office unit, and plates with little bubbles inside them, not to mention a wardrobe that was \\"almost complete and getting very respectable\\". Jack is a typical slave to the consumer culture of America and is a generally soulless and shallow individual with nothing real to live for. He finds some slight satisfaction through attennding meetings for people with diseases, such as tuberculosis, blood and brain parasites, and testicular cancer. Jack finds that going to these meetings allows him to cry, giving him an emotional release for all of his sadness, rage, self loathing, desperation, and whatever other feelings lurk deep inside him; the feelings that he can't purge by ordering furniture. These support groups become his new life, and for a time he finds happiness with them. That is, until another \\"faker\\", Marla Singer, starts going to Jack's beloved support groups as well. Jack finds that when there's anoter faker present, he is unable to cry, and he is thus robbed of his salvation. Admist all this, things just get worse for Jack as his apartment fills with gas while heis away on business and explodes.<br />After getting over the initial shock of having all his property ripped from him, Jack decides to call Tyler Durden, a man who he had met only several hours before, and who was for a short time Jack's \\"single serve friend\\". Tyler agrees to meet Jack for a drink, and the 2 of them engage in the first of many philosophical discussions throuoghout the movie, the basis of this one being whether or not Jack is better off without the apartment. After leaving the bar, Jack asks if he can stay with Tyler. Tyler agrees, but with one condition; he wants to fight Jack. Jack is stunned by this request, but agrees and proceeds to punch Tyler directly in the ear. The 2 continue fighting, and eventually involve others who gather around them. Jack finds the same release he found through crying by fighting, and is very taken by his new found interest. This is the beginning of Fight Club, an organization for men wishing to regain their masculinity by beating each other senseless.<br />Speaking from a strictly cinematic standpoint, this is a truly remarkable film. The directing, the writing, and the acting are all top notch. Norton is absolutely incredible as Jack and shows that he will most likely go on to be remembered as one of the greatest actors in the history of film. His expressiveness is amazing and he brings the character to life like no one else could have. Pitt is also great as Durden and brings a mesmerizing presence to the screen. Watching Tyler rant about the demasculinization (I hope that's a real word) of men in modern society is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter is also impressive as Marla, the only female character in the movie. She was a great choice for the character. Fincher's direction is also phenomenal. The camera work is great and the dark lighting sets a very fitting mood for the movie. The dialogue is clever, original, insightful, and anything and everything else good dialogue should be.<br />This is one of the best moviesI've ever seen. It's creativity is outstanding and the performances are magnificient, plus it never gets boring and the plot twists are great. This is a movie that dares to view violence, masculinity, consumerism, and self realization from an entirely different perspective. I reccommend this movie very highly to anyone who appreciates originality and creativity in cinema.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is written in a symplistic style -- more of a fairy tale or myth than a story meant more literally.  It follows the travels of Santiago from Spain to parts of Africa.  It's an allegory about finding your personal path and knowing when to let go of whatever holds you back.  If you're looking for a realistic story, you might be disappointed.  But I found such exaggerations (like finding an omen through hawks in the sky) as symbolic and charming additions to the story.  Of course the book doesn't suggest that we should read everything in our lives as &quot;signs.&quot;  But the obvious signs Santiago encounters are supposed to represent the less-obvious signals in our own lives.  I highly recommend the story.  It's captivating and hard to put down, and it just might make you rethink some of your own choices.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is like marmite - you either love it or hate it! There is one thing though - I guarantee you'll never forget it. Count me in as one of those who loved it, as I got whisked away in the magic of this movie. I sat there for two hours in complete awe whilst watching the extravagant world of Moulin Rouge, as the genius of Baz Luhrman shone through. You can never mistake Baz Luhrman's work, as his ideas of using historical movies with a contempary twist always captivates the audience. I sat there thinking 'I've never seen anything like this!'. Especially when you see a prositute and a bohemiam poet start singing Pride in an elephant. The idea of using the infamous night club as the set of this movie is very interesting and worked like a storm. I can't belive we can be carried through such huge ranges of emotions in such a short period of time like this - from comedy, to love, to intense drama - it's completely intriguing. I thought all performances were fantastic and shows Nicole Kidman's versatility. I also think the special features gave a much needed and fasinating insight to the movie, and it made my view of the movie slightly different. After having watched it 11 times I am still not sick of it - and I seem to discover something new everytime. This film is the most exciting thing I have ever seen in cinema, and I don't think any other film will pitch the post to my favourite.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Only a couple truly exceptional movies come out each year, Two Towers belongs in that category. Maybe it's the large scale adventure, the terrific cast, the incredible fighting scenes, or<BR>story behind the madness of the war,the struggle to go on, despite how hopeless it may seem. Whatever the reason, I enjoyed the film from start to finish.  <br />The difference between this film and the Fellowship, is that the warmth from the Fellowship the comfortable feeling that you had is gone, it is far darker and I imagine it only gets worse. <br />The movie starts out with Frodo and Sam going foward on their journey, early on you meet Gollum who was introduced briefly in the first one. When you see this long tortured creature you can't help but feel sorry for him, he's a representation of the Rings power over people (or Hobbits as it be) this makes Frodo pity him, who has himself been feeling a bit of the Rings control<BR>Then you meet up again with the other members of the Fellowship, Aragorn (who hasn't forgotten about Erwen) Legolas and Gimli (who provides much of the humor throughout the movie)who are looking for Pippin and Merry, who have managed to be captured by Orcs, thus the plot unfolds. From the very beginning you're taken in, and from that point on you are swept away into a world of far larger scale than most movies even attempt.<br />By the end of the film you are wondering what comes next (unless you've read the books) what becomes of Frodo who can't fight the ring any longer? Does Sauron win over Middle Earth? Or does someone (not neccesary who you'd think)come to the rescue.<BR>I suppose only time will tell<br />Note to hard-core die hard Tolkien fans: IF you want to see a movie that follows the book EXACTLY you may be dissapointed, because while this movie is terrific it does go its own way a bit<BR>First of all, Merry&Pippin play a far larger part in the book with the Ents, I think this is done to incorporate the characters into the plot more, they madethe Ents a little weaked willed. And secondly there is a scene with Aragorn and Erwen that occurs nowhere in the book, and this is done I believe to capture the female audience with the idea of the romance between the two. <br />But if you can look over these small changes I believe you will be very happy with the movie. I almost guarantee if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy the second, and I have a feeling the trilogy will end as well as it begun, so stay tuned.

B000007WQB|5.0|I'm only 23 and when i first heard the song, do you know the way to san jose, and since i am from san jose, my first thought was who sang such a lovely song and how to get it. I just ordered the CD and i cant wait to get the copy full of great hits from a voice i believe that falls right under the great Karen Carpenter. Dione has a great voice, i cant wait to get her CD.
B000099T2L|4.0|I'm also new to Beyonce's music and have been pleasantly surprised at how much I've enjoyed this cd.  While she's still growing as a vocalist and lyricist, I'm really looking forward to seeing how far she can excel.  I think &quot;Daddy&quot; best showcases her ability to build on a sweet melody, negotiate a complex bridge and transform some heartfelt lyrics into a soulful and emotional ode to her pops.  I've read that she was a little embarrased to include the song on her cd, but felt that her generation was not represented in the &quot;showing love to fathers&quot; department.  I'm personally glad she stepped up.<br />BTW, that song was co-written and produced by Mark Batson, India.Arie's collaborator on &quot;Brown Skin&quot; and &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom.&quot;  I don't understand why his name was not included in the cd info but the bro certainly deserves some shine too.  Look for his upcoming work with Seal.
0385504209|5.0|i'm not typically one who gets engrossed by books, because frankly, most of those daunting, thick, best-sellers bore me. But this was great. i really couldn't put it down. before i knew it, i was 70 pages into it in my first sitting. It appeals to so many people. If you like reading about religion, art, mysteries, suspense, history, or even crime chases, you'll really like this. My only complaint was that i didn't really like the last chapter..i thought it was a bit of a cop-out into a cliche novel. the epilogue was good though. also, i think maybe it was a tiny bit too quickly paced. I was nice to see things move swiftly, and have the plot grab you and jump into full swing almost right away, but the pace got a little too frantic for my taste in some parts. but still, i'm 99% satisfied, and being quite a cynical person, i'm a tough critic to please.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Back last year, I wrote a review giving these guys alot of credit.  I figured that their artistic style was no where near being finished.  I am relieved to say that their third album is finally out to buy.  The truth of the matter is, that System Of A Down, released this whole album on the internet much much much sooner than one would think.  I had already heard all these songs around the much crazed Toxicity era. It is clear that Toxicity had alot more craze and potential than this album, but still this album is amazing.  Each song is filled with its own wierdness (which is System's style).  I am not going to give you a low down on all the songs, because many other reviews have already did that.  Just here to tell you that System of A Down, is awesome, and will keep a great run going.  I am much anticipating their next album.

0385720920|4.0|This is the first Palahniuk-book I've read. His voice was generally alright, but I stumbled<BR>through the first chapter, finding it hard to go on up that long hill. Perhaps I just<BR>didn't get the humor. In any event in hindsight I think the book would have been a lot<BR>stronger and momentous if that chapter was left out. <br />Palahniuk is sarcastic. &gt;&gt;For real&lt;&lt; the book is funny. Although at the same time it's utterly<BR>depressing, because the picture Palahniuk paints of the U.S. is grim and miserable. It's<BR>accurate.<br />I've never read any author that writes like Palahniuk. It's written in a very simple style, <BR>like spoken language, and it works well. The language is concise, colorful...modern.<br />The plot is somewhat boring and I didn't find that to be what pulled along to keep reading <BR>(I finished the book in three sittings). It was the humor, the misanthropy,<BR>the gritty reality of it all that kept me flipping the pages. <br />In the end there is a tiny twist, not even a twist, a few revelations. <br />The entire book is a downward-spiral until at the end the characters get their dung<BR>together and realize that we're all in the mud together.<br />This book was a great contrast to the film &quot;Fight Club&quot; because it contains no violence. <BR>The velocity is completely different than &quot;Fight Club&quot;: the book moves about as<BR>fast as a group of teenagers drinking coffee at Denny's. You know, that type of <BR>&quot;Breakfast Club&quot;-momentum.<br />I'll be glad to read another book by Palahniuk. I can imagine though that the formula<BR>is going to be the same: cynicism, sinking lower, lower still, realization.
0380713802|4.0|NEITHER HERE NOR THERE is one of Bryson's earlier travel books, conceived somewhere around 1991.  It is a tour of Europe, excluding Spain, Portugal, and Greece.  Bryson's method of operation is to steer clear of tours and find lodging and food as needed; his planning is in maps and cultural background reading.  He travels by foot, train and bus.  This formula produces more winning museum visits and views than desirable rides,lodging and food, but he is not a glass half empty kind of guy.  He voices his opinion about bad food and attitudes but he is generous with praise when it is deserved.  <br />There is much to enjoy in this book: Bryson's style of humor, often bratty and tear-inducing in its hilarity, is full throttle.  While it is not a muse or a sentimental journey, his travels coincide with the 1973 itinerary of his hitchhiking days with pal Steven Katz, the memorable sidekick from A WALK IN THE WOODS.  Bryson sprinkles this book with memories and lessons learned from that first foray.  The one thing NEITHER HERE NOR THERE lacks is the degree of information with which he packs his later books, particularly IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY.  As he sets off in Paris, he visits a musty old bookstore called Shakespeare &amp; Company and says nothing--c'mon, Bryson, think Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein, Joyce!  He does get better as he gets into the trip, though, and refuses to let Austria and Kurt Waldheim off the hook for their roles in World War II.<br />One last note: it is interesting to see Europe before the Euro and Sarajevo and Belgrade in that sliver of time between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the devastation of the 1990s. This book is at once very contemporary (American fast food chains everywhere) and yet historic.
B00005JLK1|1.0|one of the worst films i've seen in a while. full of gore, so much of it you think you might be sick. don't bother wasting your money on renting or buying this movie.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was little. It frightened me and I loved it. Disneys first best movie. I have lived with this movie a long time and never tire of it. A real treat.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge, what a fantastic movie. It was wonderful from start to finish. Everything about this movie is great. The actors are fabulous. Ewan Mcgregor, when he started to sing 'Your Song' it's enough to make you weak in the knees. He has a beautiful voice and should consider doing more musicals. Nicole Kidman, this is one of her best performances yet. She is so beautiful in this movie. And her singing voice, wow! I can't see why Moulin Rouge was so overlooked at last years Oscars when this year Chicago took almost every award it was nominated for. But anyway, Moulin Rouge is one of the best movies around right now and I highly recomend it. The dvd is worth every cent. It's filled with extras and some scenes cut from the film. Moulin Rouge is an A+++ in my book!
B00006879E|5.0|I stumbled upon Maroon 5 one day while listening to the radio. They were playing Maroon 5's single \\"Harder to Breathe\\". I found myself bumping to the beats on my first listen of this song, and it just made me want to hear more from this band. So, yesterday I went on a whim and bought the album ...and was floored!! This album has so many good songs (there's only 1 song I may not listen to), but i listen to all the other songs and I can't get enough of it! I'm Black and I can honestly say that this is a perfect blend of alternative rock with soul/funk and great lyrics. They got it right and I applaud them and recommend this band and their album to ANYONE! Check it out or you WILL miss out on a good thing. :o)
B00008BRDX|3.0|This album is still a style searching piece of music.<BR>i guess The police didn't knew where to go exactly after slowly reaching their top of popularity.to still play reagee/ska/punk mix or maybe to go more pop/new wave oriented???<br />Their questions and frustration can be heard here : it is a mix of many styles and inspirations of each band member.<BR>we have here a bit of synth/new wave (\\"contact\\") some punk/ska (\\"Regatta de blanc\\", \\"it's allright for you\\") and more well known Policesound (\\"bed's too big without you\\"),In \\"does anyone stare\\" we even have a piano riff!!! <br />The album as whole is not as impressive as as in pieces.<BR>the most impressive tracks are \\"Bring on the night\\" - a less known melancholic reaggee tune, \\"Message in the bottle\\" - number one hit in Uk with cool guitar riff and \\"Walking on the moon\\", quite sad song wit sting's memorable lyrics.<br />It is a bit sad that wonderfull all time classics are here with some not impressive and rather sleepy moments. but it is good to have \\"regatta...\\" in your cd collection. The police on this record are still much more better band than many pop nightmares that comes in our times!!!
0812550706|5.0|Great book for children and adults. Anyone, even those who are not fans of science fiction, will find this book absolutely impossible to put down.
B000002J1O|5.0|It is one of those albums that you can write about for hours.<br />Each tracks from here deserves almost 1000 words long review.<br />I do not want to write some peans and a thinks like \\"They have never make something better than this\\" or \\"this is their best\\"<BR>so why it is so good???<br />>all tracks from here allows for each of member band to shine.<br />>almost every track from here became rock classic<br />>even \\"more fool me\\" sung by Phil - an acoustic love ballad - sounds here very good,like a part of a whole. if it was contained somewhere else it would be irritating.<br />>Peter's vocals are so expressive that sometimes you almost feel like he would stand right by you speakers.<br />>Remastered edition sounds like it was recorded again in a new professional studio, although it was recorder thirty years ago.<br />>it is one of those albums that every cd collection must contain.<br />>Everybody will find something for them, even if some will not like the album as whole.from classic progressive rockers (\\"Cinema show\\",\\"firth of fifth\\") throuhg more pop-oriented stuff (\\"i know what i like\\",\\"more fool me\\") to complicated more rhytmicaly experimenting tunes with funny lyrics (\\"battle of epping forest\\")<br />........really i must say in the end that \\"SELLING ENGLAND\\" is propably the best genesis album.<BR>Somebody who knows genesis only from hits like \\"Jesus he knows me\\" or \\"invisible touch\\" maybe shocked but everyone with opened heart and head for all music will love this. enjoy!!!
B00009ATIX|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's elegant Solaris is one of the best movies of this past year. It's a thoughtful tone poem on the nature of love and the mysteries of mortality and time. There is an assuredness in the direction, a confidence in the performances and a visual artistry in the camera direction. The maturity of the relationship between the two leads is refreshing - no cliches here. Soderbergh never makes assumptions about the intelligence of the audience, which is a relief after so many spoon-feeding Hollywood sci-fi films.<BR>I did see Tarkovsky's original Solaris and I find this version a lot more satisfying - thank goodness Soderberg did not recreate the endless scenes of old bearded philosophers arguing with each other for hours. It was a risk to make this film and sadly, audiences did not support it to the success it deserved, but for those who appreciate intelligent, thought -provoking films, this one will linger with you long after the last credits roll.
B00003CXDD|4.0|I have not seen the film since seeing it in the theatres during its original release and I think I will pickup the special edition DVD.<br />Think of it as Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings, and a few more elements thrown in for good measure.  Not an original plot by any means...Evil Queen, heroic warrior, child of prophecy...standard fantasy stuff.<br />But the performances were all very good.  Val Kilmer actually looks excited to be in a movie...a far cry from some of his more recent performances.<br />The special effects were pretty state-of-the-art for the day and I am wondering how they will hold up this many years later.<br />All in all, a very well done movie.  Action packed, humorous, and fine performances.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Easily among the top 10 movies I have ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. Daniel Day Lewis is incredible in this film. Fantastic cinematography. Great acting, even Leo did a good job. Scorcese has outdone himself. This is a great film.
0783240287|5.0|Brazil has no musical comedy's tradition and there are few opportunities for us Brazilians to keep in touch to what Americans and British wonderfully create in terms of musical plays.  So I do consider myself lucky for finding the Los Angeles cast original soundtrack of \\"Joseph...\\" in a CD store nearby, some years ago.  I had no reference at all about the play but the previous works of Weber & Rice (\\"Evita\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\") that were staged in Brazil some decades ago.  My wife and I became unconditional fans of \\"Joseph...\\" and eventually bought this DVD in order to see \\"on stage\\" all those songs we deeply love.  We got really impressed with the splendid work we purchased: Donny Osmond is a perfect Joseph, Maria Friedman is a fascinating Narrator and the whole cast shows such an enthusiasm in their performances that it is impossible not to fall in love with this film version of the play.  I strongly recommend it as an excelent purchase for the whole family.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Once again, Radiohead proves why they are among the World's all-time greatest bands. This album continues along the lines Amnesiac, rich in textures and bringing forth an interesting meeting of analog and digital soundscapes.  At the same time, songs are ordered quite nicely and arranged in a rather more structured manner. Excellent album.
0446677450|5.0|I have to laugh when I read some of the comments below about Robert Kiyosaki (skepticism about author's claims, incorrect acounting notions, etc.). This is one of the most eye-opening business books I've ever read. How I wish this type of methodology would have been taught to me when I was graduating from college and entering the business world. I'm just glad I read it before it's too late. It's incorrect I think to consider it simply as a career-path book. However, even if you become a teacher, doctor, or follow some other path that is your passion, it's still wise to develop &quot;financial intelligence&quot;. And as far as &quot;incorrect accounting notions&quot;, I studied accounting, and accounting has been a central part of my career to date. Robert's assertions can be perceived as simplified, but they are right-on for today's economic climate in my opinion. This book should be a permanent addition to your bookshelf, no matter what your career calling is.
B00008I8IF|4.0|this album is amazing, don't care what the others say<BR>it is the essence of melody. This is one of the best albums of 2003 by far. I listen to a lot of music and work in a record store and this album could never get the recognition that it deserves. A must.
B00008PC2O|5.0|That's what I call a Digital Versatile Disc(DVD). A new era in the technology of DVD. Disc one contains the Special Edition version of the film and a great feature. Yes, you can select the Interactive Mode and watch the film while reading the details of each scene. You can also watch the behind the scene of the specific scenes while you are watching the movie by pressing Enter when a Cyberdone logo appears. Disc two contains some features just for your fun and two new documantaries and the theatrical version of film in high definition which I wasn't able to play it, Because it requires a powerful PC. Note that one of the requirements is a 3GHZ processor. And it has an amazing metal case which distinguishes this DVD from all the DVDs you have ever bought. <br />Don't ever think that you don't need it if you have the Ultimate Edition. You should have both of these DVDs. And I don't know how much longer we should wait to see a new release of T2!!!!!
B000003Z12|5.0|I've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite.  It's a cd that I can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy.  This would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island.  It never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good Schon is.  Unbelievable. If you like this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too.  Two of my all time favorites.
B00008G9JO|5.0|&quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is, for me, THE quintessential Tull album.  It represents the epitome of Ian Anderson's &quot;Backwoods Bard&quot; persona; it is accessible, memorable, and most importantly, fun.  Part of my fascination with Tull is Anderson's tendency to reinvent the band with each new album, and as the followup to &quot;Songs From The Wood&quot;, I found (and still find) &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; to be extremely superior to the former.<br />In short, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is Tull's masterpiece, in my humble opinion.<br />--BB
B00008NG5V|4.0|Forget all those critics who bash artists whose cds have a similar theme to them.  It's called a person style, and if a critic can't see that, then it must say something about their own personal style.  Jack Johnston's latest effort, &quot;On and On&quot; is a terrific listen from start to finish.  His lyrics (although pessimistic at times) are soothing and relaxing as are his guitar licks, which have changed in complexity from Brushfire Fierytales.  &quot;On and On&quot; is the kind of record that needs to be listened to from start to finish, and the listener won't find this a challenge to do.  JJ's band is really tight on this album with interesting rhythms that that sets these songs apart from the John Mayers and Jason Mraz's of the world.
B00000IB4D|5.0|Wll I never even wanted to buy it. I don't like old santana much. I don't have it.
0449227545|3.0|This story is good, but certainly not up to Mr. Follett's usual tales of suspense and intrigue. There was too much emphasis on the romantic interest in the story which bogged the plot line. The environmental terrorist concept was chilling and could have been better developed.<br />It is difficult to believe that a seasoned FBI agent would let her personal feelings intefere with a serious investigation.<br />Mr. Follett usually writes great stories but this was not one of them.
B000067J1H|5.0|This is the BEST movie I've ever seen.  This movie shows what one person can do if one was so inclinded.  With the cast of BRAD PITT(Snatch), EDWARD NORTAN(American Histroy X), and the female monkey from the new Planet of the Apes movie, this movie is unstopable.  From the very first frame to the last this movie pulls you in and doesn't let go.  It has the best TWIST at the end that forces you watch it again.  The Camera angles are unbelieveable and the song track is good, if you like the PIXIES it has the song, \\"Where is my mind.\\"  I've bought this movie and I've watched it at lest 5 times, IT'S THAT GOOD.  It's full of Pharses and Quotes that are unforgetable and Eye opening.  This movie is definately in my TOP 5 favorite movies. <BR>       If you like this you'll love AMERICAN HISTORY X also staring EDWARD NORTAN.  I would also recommend the author, I don't know his name, but his books are awesome.  <br />THIS MOVIE WILL CHANGE YOU
0060925000|4.0|I bought this hardback eleven years ago, having seen Vikram Seth interviewed on Charlie Rose of PBS.  I opened it a wee bit and shelved it.  And, now, in this summer of recovery of health and cleaning out of books, I read it.  At long last!<br />I was often tired of holding or propping the massive volume up so as to read, but I moved into the 1950-1951 world of the Mehras, Chatterjis, Kahns and Kapoors and stayed for six days and nights, reading, resting, reading, dreaming, becoming one of the flys on the wall.<br />I went back and forth to the internet, searching words, and places, and foods, and people in history.  I learned.  It was not painful; long, but not painful.  And I feel that I will carry this wealth of experience with me and with it an understanding of a world culture I understood only slightly before this reading.<br />Seth truly knows the culture and the politics of India of that time.  He is young, but he did his homework and reflects the intensity of a newly independant nation in its struggle to make a new identity and maintain much of the old.<br />It seemed impossible to me that such a world with so many primitive beliefs and practices could exist side by side with the refinement of education, higher education with a highly Westernized slant.  To realize the importance of education to a world that many people still see as third world even 50 years later, was truly eye-opening.  <br />I started a legal size notepad of terms that I investigated via the internet, something I would have had less success at doing eleven years earlier, and I feel as if I have traveled this summer, not just back in time, but into another world that is strangely unreal, yet full of the same governances as much of Western culture:  democracy, the family, religious practice, sports, moral values.<br />I think I can only imagine how my former Pakistani and Indian students must have reflected on this culture of the United States.  I feel enriched to have lived with Seth's book for so many days and to have gained new respect for the world of India.  <br />This book is thick in politics, in the struggle of various family members to maintain or to gain political power, for the good of India and for themselves.  It is rich in class struggle, above the caste system, into the British system of its former colonial days.  It is a book brimful with Urdu poetry, so foreign to this reader.  It is a novel rich in varied characters, full and real.  The humor and pathos are balanced skillfully, as Mrs Rupa Mehra pursues the search for a suitable boy for her younger daughter, Lata.  And as the reader follows Mrs Mehra's pursuit, he or she also immerses into the world of vibrant India at her national beginning.  <br />What a classic piece of work.  How I wish the Brits would produce it in a mini-series!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Release date: September 30th 2003 from Warner Home Video<br />2 discs:  The film, commentary and several documentaries.  We are promised that the film will be remastered in \\"Ultra-Resolution digital video restoration\\".  From the details I've seen it looks like being a definitive version of the film...
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am not a great fan of musicals present or past. However, every once in a while one catches my eye (for example: Grease). I saw this movie and absolutely loved it. Enough even to buy the soundtrack moments after watching it. I still listen to the soundtrack reliously and can not wait to buy the DVD! No musical since Grease will surpass this movie for a while. All the actors are fantastic for their roles and impressed me with their abilities to sing and dance as well as they do. Go out and buy this one!
B00008VGK0|3.0|i still believe this is the wors song Madonna has released as a lead single from an album. it just didn't work! however, the Oakenfold, Felix, and Rauhofer Anthem Part 2 do WONDERS for the song. I truly feel that the Oakenfold mix should have been the album and radio version. It actually makes the track seem coherent unlike the album version which sounds like a cut-and-paste MESS. The Missy remix is just as bad. The bonus mix of Die Another Day is AWESOME. Hupmty is one of the best remixers to tackle Madonna. check out his other M remixes.
0385509456|5.0|I lean on Amazon for reviews but have never written one until now. The little boy in this book, Christopher, leaps from the pages to enter the heart and mind of the reader.  He does so with tenderness, humor and delight.  He stays with you and you are grateful for the author, Mark Haddon, in bringing him to your world of books.  I just bought 2 for gifts.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When i first watched to the \\"Dirrty\\" on the internet, me and my friends have the same thought, Is she Xtina? Why she became so dirrrty, and we felt a bit disappointed too and we decided not to buy this album. After that, \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Fighter\\" were released. Then i changed my mind and bought this album \\"secretly\\". But suprisingly when i'm in the queue to pay for it, i saw one of my friend who have the same opinion before also holding the same album too. Haha....very funny. After listened to this album a couple of times, i love it more and more !!!! This album is not just to entertain people with awesome music, at the same time, it also sending out great messages and telling people stories. Now, i accepted \\"Dirrty\\" as her first single, because it is so catchy. Now it already became one of my favourite song. So glad \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" will be the next single, is my favourite song too. For those who hate \\"Dirrty\\", just try to listen to this album, then you will changed your mind. Go girl, you deserved the best. Why i just gave this album 4 star since i like it so much? Because 70 minutes not enough for me, it should be more Xtina, and why didn't include the awesome ballad \\"I Will Be\\" in this album? <BR>My Favourite Songs :<BR>1. Dirrty<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down<BR>3. Walk Away<BR>4. Beautiful<BR>5. Keep Singing My Song<br />Really expect her new album now.
B00008PX8P|2.0|This is for Led Zep fan only. Many video were not in top quality. For general music fans, skip this. <br />The Song Remains the Same is a much better choice.
B000099T2L|5.0|I am a big Destiny's Child fan and after hearing the many different delays of this CD I was a bit worried. But after buying this CD I have to say that waiting was the best thing that Beyonce did. I love songs like Crazy In Love and How You Like It as well as Naughty Girl. Such a different vibe than most R&B songs out there. Baby Boy and Hip Hop Star are great songs with such a unique flavor to them and they flow like butter. Speechless is the best slow song I have heard in ages. It is sexy and beautiful. Yes and Me Myself and I are just as cool. Signs is just trippy and Missy has done it again. Very 70's sound to it. And Daddy isn't as corny as i thought it would sound. Dangerously In Love is just as bright as it was on Survivor and I am glad she chose to give this overlooked song a chance. And I can see why Luther Vandross called Beyonce the best artist he's ever worked with. The Closer I Get to You is one of the best remakes I have heard in a while. Brilliant, magnificent what can i say. Beyonce makes it sound beautiful. All in all one of the best of this year and I am proud of Beyonce. Great job!
B00005AQGH|5.0|all of you 2pac fans should order this album cause it's the best.<BR>i just ordered mine.all the songs are cleverly written,to be awesome!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the guy from NJ a few reviews down the line is clearly insane.  I may very well be a &quot;diehard&quot; Radiohead fan who will &quot;automatically&quot; give this album 5 stars, but anyone giving this album less than 5 stars may have listened to it, but did not hear it.  I like Kid A and Amnesiac, but I didn't love either of them.  Hail To The Thief awoke a part of me that has slept soundly through the last few boring years of music.  This may be going out on a limb, but I dare say that this is Radiohead's greatest album ever.  Yes I know that's a pretty hefty statement, but give this album 3 listens and you'll hear wonders unbeknownst to human ears.  Diehard Radiohead fan maybe, but I know intelligent music when I hear it, and Radiohead is &quot;following&quot; nobody.  Apparently music is much different in New Jersey.  Sad.
B00005AQGH|5.0|this album has some great hits like:hail mary,to live and die in l.a, me and my girlfriend and more.it could of been better if it featured people like Dre and Snoop but it's still a creepy great album released by 2pac(makaveli).Tupac went out with a bang by realeasing this album.a must have.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Huston has caught the spirit of B. Traven's book by the same title.  Bogart captures Fred C. Dobb's gradual demise as the disease of gold possesses his mind. And Huston doesn't need to use graphic vulgarities to get the point across.  So many \\"modern\\" dramas rely on vulgar language to depict decadence, which always seem to take away from the intensity of the scenes rather than add to them.  <br />I put Treasure of the Sierra Madre at the top of my all time<BR>favorite movie list.
B00003CX9E|5.0|As I became more intrested and knowldegable in film, I chose to revisit this film.  It is a classic.  If you remember the old review, forget it.
B00005ASOC|3.0|... unfortunately, a mess.  I had high hopes for a movie that purported to take writing seriously, a movie with talented actors like Sean Connery and Anna Paquin (with whom newcomer Rob Brown holds his own).  And it starts well enough: Jamal Wallace (Brown), a star basketball player whose true, hidden gift is writing, happens to meet William Forrester (Connery), who wrote one Pulitzer Prize-winning novel then disappeared.  The two begin an uneasy friendship, and Forrester helps Jamal with his writing, even as Jamal receives a scholarship to a private school and is befriended by the mature, understanding Clare (Paquin).  From there, however, the plot implodes with cliches and nonsense--a professor out to get the jock, a writing contest, a bitter teammate, allegations of cheating, the state championship game, the redemption scene, and so on.  (Why did Forrester never write another book?  The answer is less than satisfactory.)<br />Starting with the _______-ing ________ title (both words of course starting with the same letter), the screenplay has the marks of excessive Hollywood handling all over it, and so it lacks the passion of Dead Poets Society, the raw energy of Good Will Hunting, and the excitement of The Karate Kid.  I'd recommend watching any of those three before this one.  And before that, I'd recommend reading (among others) The Great Gatsby, Cry the Beloved Country, All the Pretty Horses, and To Kill a Mockingbird.  (Or reading them again.)<br />If you're a hard-core fan of Connery or \\"feel good\\" movies, this could be a decent weekend rental.  Otherwise, the above-mentioned films and books are much more satisfying.  (Some other decent, writing-related movies: The Hours, The Whole Wide World, and Shakespeare in Love.)  A disappointing 2-1/2 stars.
B0000640SA|2.0|Intresting premise that loses its' luster halfway through the film.  What we're left with is boring acting, and some predictable twists.  Decent directing keeps it from one star, but just barely.  This is just more overrated junk like The Shining and The Matrix.  Avoid if you know what's good for you.
B00009V7RF|3.0|Having been a fan since their first album dropped, I was a little worried after reviews lambasting this new disc and deriding the inclusion of Justin Timberlake.  Bridging The Gap was an incredible album so a letdown could be expected, but the fact that the Peas grabbed a new member and decided to go with a funk theme is quite a turn.  As it turns out, the disc really doesn't have much substance, but is good to listen to nonetheless.  Best track is Shut Up by a long shot, but I also like Let's Get Retarded since I've been sayin that for years when the crew's about to get trashed and crazy.  Fergie is a great addition and her vocal parts really dominate the tracks where she is featured.  Some easy Latin tracks in the middle of the disc w/Sergio Mendes are good for zoning out.  Overall, I'd expect to hear some of these songs at clubs, but I hope that the Peas get back to focusing at least a little bit on the lyrics for the next album.  In the meantime, if you need a live top quality hip-hop fix, go rock the Liquid Mix tour with THE ROOTS and Talib Kweli, some of the best in the game!
B000055Y0X|5.0|Clever writing, excellent acting, and for once decent direction from Kubrick makes this film a classic, and a must-see by all those looking for the perfect black comedy.
0792844890|4.0|if you like funny things, you'll like spaceballs. that is all.
B00006JKON|4.0|This album divides fans as surely as A Passion Play, the album that preceded it.  The fans that felt Tull had gone too far with another long-song album, APP, are probably the same ones who embraced the return to the more conventional short song format, and vice versa.  However, this remastered/extended version gives us a fresh chance to reevaluate the material and its place in the Tull canon almost 30 years later.  <br />I'm too young to have bought it orginally, but after getting into Tull in the late 80's, I eventually picked it up.  At the time I felt the title track and Ladies were the weakest tracks and Two Fingers, while enjoyable, paled to the original Aqualung outtake version.  I couldn't understand why a great track like Rainbow Blues and a solid number like Glory Row had been relegated to outtake status when Third Hoorah took up precious space as a souped up reprise of the title track.  Since Ian wisely went back to the '72 Chateau tapes for Skating Away and Only Solitaire, and revisted the man as animal theme for Sea Lion and Bungle, I was also stunned that Scenario/Audition/No Rehearsal, IMO the best part of those sessions, was not considered (it could have worked as a mini song suite the same way Baker St. Muse worked on Minstrel). Imagine how impressive the album would have been with a reworked song line-up containing this material.  Of course it cannot be forgotten that this album originally stemmed from an aborted film project that swirled around the thematic ideas of APP, with more musings on the afterlife (the orginal film outline can be now be viewed on Tull's site...). <br />Given the fate of the film, the resulting album does come across as a bit disjointed.  Material written for the film now sat alongside newer compositions that just didn't fit thematically, with stronger material remaining on the sidelines.  Maybe Ian had grown so tired of the events of the last 2 years, the scrapped '72 Chateau sessions, the critical back lash that followed APP, and now an abadoned film project, that he somewhat threw this album together in an effort to get everything behind him and make a fresh start.  But that's where this remaster shines, by incorporating most of the unused material, the album now offers a more cohesive listening experience than it ever did before (I still think Scenario, etc would've fit perfectly, oh well).  <br />For those who dislike the inclusion of bonus tracks, I think you're nuts.  If you are buying an album for remastered sound, which blows away the older CD version by the way, isn't it a plus to also get extra material at the same time?  Of the bonus tracks on War Child, only Rainbow Blues and Glory Row date from the original Spring '74 sessions.  The remaining songs, along w/March the Mad Scientist and Pan Dance, which wound up as bonus tracks on Minstrel, were recorded later in '74 prior to the War Child tour.  Techincally they are outtakes, but since some pieces were intended for use on the tour, and given the fact that they couldn't have been included in the original album anyway, I'm not sure that label is entirely accurate.  War Child Waltz is as beautiful a piece as Quartet is quirky.  Saturation rocks and Paradise Steakhouse is just bizarre lyrically.  Of the original cuts, Back Door Angels is the most complex piece and comparable to material on APP, Bungle gets the most scorn from hard-core fans for being too commercial, but its still a great tune, and Skating Away is classic Tull.  All things considered, this new version of War Child is an album that now ranks as one of Tull's best efforts from the classic period of '68-'79.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is still fresh and entertaining after all these years. It was so well done that whatever may seem dated is very charming. The color is fantastic. <BR>The humor still holds up, and aside from a slightly silly looking space ship,  the special effects were great.<BR>This movie is a classic worthy of any collector of great movies, shelf.
B000088E6D|5.0|This album is wonderful. This young man is incredibley talented. I love it.
B000099T2L|5.0|I was very undecided as to whether or not I wanted to get this album, but I finally decided to give it a whirl. I am extremely glad I did! I think Beyonce did a fantastic job on her &quot;1st official solo album&quot;, eventhough it seems like her 4th solo album when you really think about it....(She's the only one you really here on all 3 Destiny's Child albums so they might as well be her own realistically!) I can honestly say that this is one of the few CD's that you can listen to with out skipping from song to song. My favorite song is the duet with Luther! Its beautiful! I also love Be With You, Me Myself &amp; I, Yes, Signs, Baby Boy &amp; Thats How I Like It. Overall I think she did a really great job &amp; hopefully she'll keep up the good work!
B00009V7T2|5.0|A friend recently told me about Mars Volta, and I listened to the stuff and I love it. Now, don't kill me for this, but some of the songs remind me of Marilyn Manson's Mechanical Animals cd. It's got that same kind of creepy ambiance, especailly Televators.
0385508417|4.0|This is not one of his serious mysteries, but a fun one about a couple who decides to skip all the hoopla of Christmas because their daughter isn't going to be home for it this year.  They decided that they would use the money for a trip instead.  They run into all sorts of censorship and problems from their neighbors and everyone over the deal.  It is quite entertaining.  Buy the book if you want something that is light to read and leaves you smiling.
B00008IAMD|5.0|If you like Johnny Cash, you will love this. But be prepared,  almost evey song says he is ready to go. He covers his Christian beliefs, his love for his wife, disappearing friends and hope for meeting adain one day. The best work of his life, and since June is gone, probably his last as well. The video of &quot;Hurt&quot; always leaves me near tears, you won't regret this purchase!
B0000508U6|5.0|Normally a band's first album has a few good songs and a bunch of leftovers making up the rest of the disc. It takes a truly special group to produce a complete CD the first time around. And that's exactly what Parachutes is.<BR>Many of you will look at this CD and judge it solely for &quot;Yellow&quot; (I've heard Parachutes called &quot;Yellow and Eleven Other Songs&quot; before!), but each song has its merit and holds its place. Two years on, and of all the discs in my collection, this is the one that I come back to and rediscover consistently every couple of months.<BR>I'd have to count &quot;We Never Change&quot;, &quot;Don't Panic&quot; and &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; as my favourites, but I could almost say that about all of them. To produce a bunch of songs like this on the first try is testament to Coldplay's talent.
0385504209|1.0|Well, I must be an army of one, but this is the most wretchedly written book it's been my misfortune to encounter in many a long day.  I'm a lifelong mystery and thriller afficionado, and it's rare that such an interesting concept has been presented in such a banal, pedestrian, stultifying, and often ridiculous style.  Phooey.<br />. . . but many others have loved it, so . . .
B00005B4GU|4.0|Released a bare nine months after Kid A, many people seem intent on describing Amnesiac as the Kid A Outtakes CD. While it's not quite as strong, it does hold its own. While not as complete an album, Amnesiac arguably has the two best songs in &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot;. I seem to keep coming back to these two like long-lost friends.<BR>Other stand-outs on the album include &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot; and <BR>&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;.<BR>It's certainly a hot topic of discussion amongst the fans as to which of the CDs is better - you certainly can't review Amnesiac without reviewing Kid A. But you certainly can't own one and not the other. They were designed to be bookends, and in that respect, Radiohead succeeded. <BR>Amnesiac is still the utterly brilliant psuedo-electronic rock experimentation that we've since come to expect from Radiohead. It's just that Kid A is slightly better. Not that there's any harm in that.

014028009X|2.0|After falling in love with the movie,I was really looking forward to the book,especially since I heard a lot of people saying that the book was much better than the movie.And I was really disappointed by the book.It's really boring!!!The Bridget in the book is a shallow,neurotic,self-envolved person and it's is really hard to empasize with her.She goes on and on about her problems,which are really small and unimportant that it's really annoying and tiresome to continue the reading.And I don't think the book is funny at all.What supposed to be funny,the fact that she weights herself every 30 min?Or that she knows nothing about anything and working in the publishing firm never read a book,except for the sex manual?<BR>It's amazing that out of all this boring material the movie came out so interesting and kind and funny.Instead of reading a book I would recommend to rent a movie and then wait for a sequel.
B00004XONN|5.0|Firstly, Kid A is not for everyone. Those who like their music loud and are expecting an album full of Creep or Electioneering style songs will be disappointed.<BR>On the other hand, when U2 tried to experiment with dance music during the Zooropa/Pop era, this is the album they should have written. For those who like rock music and electronica equally, you're liable to find Kid A the equivalent of musical nirvana.<BR>On the first listen, I wondered what Radiohead were up to. On the second listen, I realised they were simply years ahead of their time.<br />Thom Yorke and co. took their Britpop sounds of previous albums, and employed a whole heap of different styles to them.<BR>Everything In Its Right Place uses extensive resampling.<BR>Kid A renders Thom's voice almost indistinguishable with filtering.<BR>The National Anthem sounds like the band found a jazz brass section on an acid trip.<BR>Idioteque is about as close to techno-pop as a band like Radiohead will ever get.<br />The amazing thing about this CD is that all the above are mixed together in a melting pot of new styles and sounds, and it works. They experimented, and they not only succeeded, but they blew away just about every reviewer that listened.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Not a huge fan of metallica but thought I would give this a try after seeing the concert on cable.  I suspect that the hard-core metallica fan will find it so-so as the orchestra softens the raucous and raw metal sound, but I found the blending of the 2 to be very good quality on most songs especially &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;, &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; and &quot;Fuel&quot;.
0688163173|2.0|I have read all of Mr. Lehane's books, and all demonstrate that he is a terrific writer, capable of pulling you in with well-developed characters, great imagery, and page-turning plots. Unfortunately, he seems in this novel to be trying out a different genre, something more from the Thomas Harris or Stephen King line. That's not a &quot;bad&quot; thing, but it is not only entirely unnecessary but, in this case, unsuccessful. Mr. Lehane throws in everything but the kitchen sink - a 150 mph hurricane, a mental institution worthy of Dr. Channard, explosions, swarms of rats, nightmares, migraines, hallucinations: a veritable &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot;. The whole book turns into one big &quot;booga booga booga&quot;, without any REAL tension, scares, or surprises. The ending is entirely predictable - we've been there before in ANY number of similar novels, and therefore I was forced to ask, &quot;Just WHAT is this all about? WHY did he write THIS?&quot;<br />A very minor nit to pick: at one point, the protagonist is escorted into a large sitting room where a phonograph is playing music with piano and strings. The music sets a mood and triggers a flashback as a plot device. When questioned, a doctor volunteers that the music is by Mahler. I don't believe Mahler ever wrote anything for piano and strings, and if he did, it is not only REALLY obscure but it undoubtedly wouldn't be &quot;tinkling&quot;. Poor research, pretension, or laziness? Your call, but that small scene, to me, was indicative of an author not at the peak of their form and probably coasting a bit.<br />I still look forward to Mr. Lehane's next novel, but I hope that he will go back to what he does best, rather than poach other authors' turf.
B000069HK2|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little hesitant to check out the Used. I thought their big claim to fame would be that their singer had once dated Kelly Osbourne. After seeing them last week on the Warped Tour and buying their CD, I definitely see that I was wrong. Bert has such an amazing voice. He can go from a controlled scream to having a clear, peacefull sound. His vocal range is also amazing. He reminds me of Mike Patton of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle in that he truly uses his voice as an instrument. The lyrics are also very poetic. I find myself singing these songs to myself all day when I'm away from my stereo. One of the best things I've heard in awhile. <br />So far, my favorites are &quot;The Taste of Ink,&quot; &quot;Bulimic,&quot; &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects,&quot; &quot;Poetic Tragedy,&quot; &quot;Blue and Yellow,&quot; and &quot;Buried Myself Alive.&quot;
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is off the hook. The tracks are gangsta and everybody can enjoy this album. If you don;t have it already, get it. Here are the tracks and what I thought of them:<br />1)Intro- pretty starightforward. Bullets hit a table and 50 loads a gun, cocks it and the next track begins.<br />2)What up Gangsta- Tight song, but a bit too short. 4/5<br />3)Patiently Waiting- Does this song need an explanation. Eminem comes off much stronger than 50 on this one, and the DR.DRE beat on EM'S verse makes it even better.   5/5<br />4)Many Men- How can u not like this song. Bit slower than most, but tight song anyhow. 5/5<br />5)In Da Club- Overplayed, but really good song.  4/5<br />6)High all the Time- Love this song...5/5<br />7)Heat- Not for ppl who want a more &quot;pop&quot; song. Straight gangsta and I like it. 4.5/5<br />8)If I Can't- One of the best songs on the album. Nice beat by Dre and great lyrics. 5/5<br />9)Bloodhound- Nice Music and Young Buck is tight.  4/5<br />10)Back Down- Hilarious Ja Rule diss. Actually take some time to listen to the what 50 has to say. Quite enjoyable. 5/5<br />11)P.I.M.P- Great song, but alot of singing. This is what I meant about being &quot;pop&quot; A song like this. Good effort though. 4.5/5<br />12)Like my Style- Bit too plain but still a great sing. 4/5<br />13)Poor Lil Rich- One of the best also. Tight beat and great lyrics. 5/5<br />14)21 Questions- Nate Dogg makes this song amazing. Could be one verse longer, though. 5/5<br />15)Don't push me- doesn't need any explanation. 5/5<br />16)Gotta Make it to Heaven- Not the greatest, but enjoyable. 3.5/5<br />Bonus:<br />17)Wanksta- 4.5/5<br />18)U Not Like Me- 5/5<br />19)Life's on the Line- 4/5<br />This is a great CD, go cop it right now!<br />My Top Five Songs on the CD:<br />1.If I Can't<BR>2.Don't Push Me<BR>3.High All The Time<BR>4.U Not Like Me<BR>5.Back Down (Patiently Waiting follows this song on the list)
B00009EIQE|1.0|It kills me to write another bad review of a Buddy Guy album, but just when I thought he was done with trying to sound like someone else (see Sweet Tea) here comes an album where every track sees Buddy doing an impression of one of the greats.  Hey record company!  Hey Buddy!  Buddy Guy IS one of the greats.  Why in the world would you tell him to try to sound like someone else... especially a song like Hard Time Killin' Floor Blues - Buddy is the anti-Skip James... and that song was done to death with the Oh Brother fervor.<BR>It would be difficult to imagine Buddy doing a worse album than this.  He's done some KILLER acoustic stuff... anything where he's doing the music he truly loves is worth owning.<BR>Whoever is guiding Buddy in this stuff needs to be fired.  Oh, and to make things worse the other musicians, especially the acoustic bass player, have NO FEEL for the blues!  It's sad.  Really, really sad.  <BR>If you buy this because you love Buddy, as I did, you will just be encouraging more of this junk.  Let's just all say no & get what we really need... a pure Buddy Guy album with no guests & some mind blowing guitar playing... electric, acoustic, whatever.  Please?
0872860175|5.0|I reread this little book before attempting to review it. I remembered that it was a mad mantra of transcendent power from the heart of hell, but I didn't remember how nondated it was. This work is fresher and more relevant than 99% of what passes for poetry today. How can something last nearly 50 years without going stale or becoming trite? How can it be even more real now? Maybe it is because Ginsberg ripped it live, screaming, and bleeding from a place beyond time and beyond space. He tore it from the living bowels of MOLOCH itself and showed it to HIM. After all, what does divine madness know of time?<br />This poem is transcendence itself. It demonstrates that when you plunge into the deepest pit of hell it either kills you, or perhaps it burns out your insides so that you become a soulless zombie, OR you transcend it and rise howling to become a Mad Poet Saint who can truely encompass the Sacred in the Profane.<br />Read this poem, and the others like America, A Supermarket in California, Sunflower Sutra, Wild Orphan, and In Back of the Real. It's almost frightening how relevant to daily life it is. If you didn't know it, you would never guess that it was written in the 50's. Of course Ginsberg does invoke, holy eternity in time holy the clocks in space the fourth dimension, in the Footnote. Maybe that's why it's timeless. As Cassady used to say, we know time, yes, we know time....<br />I wish I would have been there for that first public reading in San Fran with Kerouac running around the audience passing the wine jug. On all the planes, the Gods themselves must have jumped back in shock as a flaming monkeywrench of living poetry was jammed through the spokes of the great quivering meat wheel of conception....
B000002UJQ|5.0|Having dismissed Radiohead after the Creep single I quietly forgot this band for the next few releases until I heard Karma Police. I was intrigued but didn't buy this album right away and should have. This album has received dirision and accolades for its near complete abandonment of the earlier releases of guitar rock. Radiohead instead set out to recreate their sound and develop a complex and haunting portrait of the urban malaise they inhabit. Something that many can relate to. My father listened to this and said they had a Pink Floyd kind of sound. I initially thought, what is this man saying? But after listening to it over again and again I realized what he was saying. It was Radiohead's ability to create a deep and complex sonic landscape that didn't completely drop song structures and semblences of pop sensibilities to generate a new found appreciation for the complexities of music. This isn't the Wall but its tone and theme of paranoia, despair and the response to them are similar.<br />A highly recommended album.Certainly a starting point for the new fan and a challenged departure for the early fans of this band.
0446605409|5.0|Plum Island for me ranks as one of the best books in the Genre, and it is the kind of book I love to read.<br />It takes place in a great setting being the far tip of Long Island, and gets into what is going on at Plum Island and the history of Pirates in the reigon. <br />John Corey is our guide through this story which is interesting from the first sentence to the last.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I became a fan of Radiohead with Ok Computer and each progressive release is just that...progressive. Radiohead has decided that they are making music that keeps them satisfied and hope that the fans are willing to come along for the ride. Amnesiac lifts the bar again with further developed song structure that is both melodic and complex but in a non-traditional pop format. Instead Radiohead create a mood within each song and build upon that mood progressively until the off-kilter New Orleanseque funeral march of Life in a Glasshouse closes the album. This is not a happy album but not all music must be. Many times the darkest albums can be the most uplifting by creating a tension between the two and letting the listener find a sense of release and cathartic relief in listening to it. Amnesiac does that and more.<BR>This is a band that will be around for a long time and will continue to surprise and challenge itself and its fans for a long time to come.
0316666343|5.0|I was reading and enjoying The Lovely Bones last year when my husband died suddenly and unexpectedly. I had to put the book aside for a while; my pain was too raw. When I returned to it, I found Sebold's treatment of her characters' individual grieving processes enormously insightful and the book's resolution ultimately comforting. The book was an entertaining story, certainly, but highly effective grief therapy, as well.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all...-Don't get me wrong I have the all of their CD's and also love them but there is just something about this one....I am looking forward to seeing them play the material on this album live when I see them at Roseland on July 22, 2003....Jack White is a young musical genius!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is THE ultimate DVD, and here's why.<br />Any Zep fanatic knows the sinister stories swirling around guitar mastermind Jimmy Page.  No matter how much you love the man's music, one has stop to give thought about a person so openly intrigued by (and/or involved in) the occult.  The man truly worked to cultivate an image like that of a wizard, only I don't think people realized it at the time.  Does it surprise anyone that the band was seriously into Tolkien?<br />To give fans a view of that perspective all these years later, and to clarify our reflections on the powerhouse band that was Led Zeppelin, Page holed up somewhere in a studio for a few years to craft this beautiful, breathtaking film.  It is much more than a concert movie -- it plays like a mystical adventure, sort of like the Lord of the Rings played out to music from stages across Britain and America.<br />Page looks like a Dark Lord when he takes the stage -- hair black and stringy, clothes hanging off his body in the semblance of a cape, wheeling his guitar around as though a wand.  Robert Plant, on the other hand, comes off as the iconic hero, the Lord of the Light if you will -- his voluminous golden hair stretching forever, his innocent smiles to his worshipers, the slightly naive sound of his sexual squeals during intense jams.  Jones and Bonham, meanwhile, stay on the sidelines, as though they might jump to one or the other's side in battle at a moment's notice.<br />If you are now or ever once were into Led Zeppelin, I cannot recommend this movie enough.  The picture clairty and sound quality are amazingly intense and perfectly restored.  The editing is superb.  The song selection is classic (especially the acoustic tracks on disc 2).  And get this: each of the menu sequences has its own short film 3 to 5 minutes in length that help play the story out further.  If Page had had the proper time and technology back in the day, this film is what The Song Remains the Same would have been, withoutthe cheesy fantasy sequences.  The two don't even compare.  In some ways, they are different sides of the same coin.<br />Here's a question: Did Zeppelin ever have a completely bad song, one that just plain SUCKED?  I argue no, and that by that litmus test they are the greatest band of them all.  Furthermore, I love Jerry Garcia, Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, and Jimi Hendrix -- but Jimmy Page might have been the greatest of them all.  Maybe it was the dark magic after all.
B00008DDSC|2.0|basically i found this movie very disappointing.i watched it with great interest at the beginning and then i just wanted it to get to the end of the movie.i liked the idea that two people with all their quirks found each other.they first had to accept the differences in themselves before they could have a relationship with one another.the movie just lost my interest somewhere in the middle and that &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere at the end in his office with her family and friends ----i was just rolling my eyes with the corniness of it all.
0316666343|5.0|This book was beautiful, tragic, and heartwarming all at once. The story, the characters, and their growth is real. The heaven she describes is most believable, at least an interesting concept. It normally takes me monthes to finish books. This book took me 3 days. <br />To those of you wondering about the Icicle: there is a part earlier in the book where she says an icicle would be the perfect murder weapon-- because the murder weapon melts.
0671027573|5.0|This book is the perfect read.It has all that I require in a book---good story,humor,romance,great sex,hot guy,unexpected plot twist,happy ending.<BR>      After I read this book I went around recomending it to all my \\" reader friends\\".
B000005RTG|3.0|To this day, I'm baffled by the postumous aclaim heaped on Tommy Bolin.  There is no way to describe his playing here as anything more than tentative.  He's got two tricks, and they are employed here ad nauseaum.  I defy any one of his many fans out here to deny this...he uses the same &quot;slide up to a high note,&quot; lick on NEARLY EVERY SONG. Once you notice, it is very hard to ignore and kind of ruins the album.  Elsewhere (Coming Home) you'll hear him puntuate the track with simple, predictable one note blasts that simply mimic the chords.  Sorry fans, I know he has a very devoted fan base, but his reputation couldn't have been earned here.  One needs to go back just one album earlier (Stormbringer) to hear some truly inovative and thoughful guitar licks, fills and solos.  Nothing here compares to even the most bland playing on Stormbringer (which is grossly underated in my opinion).  Aside from the uninspired guitar playing, the album is very consistent and listenable.  Certainly heavier than its predecessor, with some great riffs.  And there is also an incredible impersonation of Stevie Wonder (who'd have thunk it?) mixed with a touch of Beach Boys on the slow track.  Nice record, but IMHO Blackmore's shoes were just too big for anyone to fill.
B000005RFQ|5.0|Delectable disappointment. Really good. I've always liked Black Sabbath and Deep Purple.
B00005JKCH|3.0|PROS- Entertaining comic book adaptation with excellent action sequences sure to provide some visceral enjoyment.  Maguire does a good job as arachnid boy and surprisingly plays the stud aspect of Peter Parker well (and unsuprisingly plays the dorky part well too.) There are some other strong performances as well and Dafoe is excellent as the over the top Green Goblin (his sufboard is cool!)  The old man who plays Gramps brought a tear to my eye!  Raimi does a good job of giving the comic book aura to the movie and props to him for staying real to the comic book.  <br />CONS- the movie can be a bit uneven at time and keeps going for about 15 minutes too long.  The final funeral scene was sooooo painfull.  Unfortunately Franco comes from the Hayden Christensen school of acting.  <br />Bottom Line:  you have been living in a cave if you don't know what to expect with this one.
B000002KHH|5.0|These guys weren't preachers or prophets. But they had the idea that they could sing about serious things, real things, relevant things and that they could rock those ideas into our heads like never before. In Paranoid, as in all their albums, Sabbath treats hell as something real and sinister; not the party town of AC/DC. Sabbath treats the evil that men do not as justifiable self-gratification nor as any greed based entitlement. The Sabbath of Iron Man and Hand of Doom presents evil for what it is: that which lessens men, that which curses mankind.<BR> Fans have a history of loving this album and consequently anything after Sabotage is criticized not for departing from the Paranoid formula, but for simply not being Paranoid. Sabbath was at their wide-ranging, hard-hitting best on this and their next two albums, but their message and their metal lives on in all their albums.
0440224764|5.0|Some of Grisham's works really grab hold of you even months after reading. Unlike The Brethren, this is just such a book.<br /><br />Of course, Grisham here is writing of lawyers and thus has a good handle on the topic. But, that is not the key reason this book works. For me, anyway, what Grisham did right was character development.<br /><br />I strongly recommend The Partner, an outstanding story.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|The score to &quot;The Hours&quot; is one of the best scores from a film in a long time.  Walking onto the film I had no idea that the score I was about to hear would be so fantastic.  Composer Philip Glass does an extraordinary job.  What's so amazing about the music, is how it fits the tone of the film.  The score builds up, as if one's rage or anger is building up and then it finally explodes.  <br />I am not familiar with Glass's other work, but will definitly check it out after hearing what he's done with this.
B000093BDX|5.0|If you were a teenager in the Summer of '63 (or '64, '65, and '66) you were listening to the Beach Boys. Their songs were playing on car radios, on transistor radios at the beach, and on radios in your room. The &quot;hit&quot; radio versions were &quot;singles&quot; mixed in mono for maximum impact over the &quot;one speaker&quot; radios that most teens were listening to.<br />Some, but not all, teens could afford to buy albums, and bought the &quot;stereo&quot; album mixes of those hits. But, the stereo mixes were NOT the hit versions we had heard (and burned into our memories) during weeks of radio re-playing.<br />The strong point of this &quot;ultimate&quot; Beach Boys CD is that when two mixes are available, the &quot;hit&quot; version, often in mono, is the mix that is used. These are the REAL thing, just the way they sounded back in 1963.<br />Thirty of the Beach Boys best songs...an audio &quot;time machine&quot; that can transport &quot;baby boomers&quot; back four decades in time...on a single CD at an attractive price. What more could a Beach Boy fan ask for?
B000092ZYY|4.0|I know a lot of you out there are probably deciding whether to get the regular version of Hail to the Thief, the special edition, or if you're a big enough fan to get both. Well, I got both, and so I've taken the liberty to list what's different about the two editions.<br />Things they have in common:<br />- Same tracks<br />- Lyric booklet<br />Things the regular edition has exclusively:<br />- An extended roadmap continuing off the cover<br />- A black cd<br />- A regular shaped, plastic cd case<br />- Cheaper<br />Things the special edition has exclusively:<br />- A large poster that looks like one of the pages inside the regular edition's booklet, only enlarged, with a color key, and some notes at the bottom.<br />- A white cd<br />- A larger, paper cd case<br />- More expensive<br />So, which cd is a better buy? Well, I liked them both. I found it odd that the special edition didn't have the extended roadmap that the regular edition has. Either way, the cd is still an awesome one.
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis's story about the Oakland A's contrarian, statistics driven approach to building a baseball team is outstanding. The book provides interesting detail and lessons to be learned in an engaging style that kept me turning the pages until I was finished. The story is about how Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta went about exploiting baseball's player market value inefficiencies to turn one of the lowest payroll teams in the league into a contender. Interesting stuff while a surprisingly light and entertaining read. <br />I am not a big baseball fan. I bought the book after hearing Mr. Lewis interviewed on the radio where he focused on the observations this book was making about the flaws inherent in subjective \\"that's how we have always done it\\" decision making. I thought the book might support my own thoughts on the subject and I was right...focus on process and outcomes usually take care of themselves.  <br />I never really followed the game of baseball very closely, but you can bet that I will follow the second half Oakland's season like a life-long A's nut!
1573228737|4.0|Arguably, Sarah Waters is one of the most prolific contemporary authors of Victorian fiction. She has a gift of creating realistic and three-dimensional female protagonists immersed in a Victorian London setting that comes alive. In AFFINITY Margaret, a young spinster, is battling many personal demons. Her beloved father recently passed away, her secret lover chose her brother over her, and her overbearing mother is treating her like a child. Margaret's world takes a turn when she volunteers as a Lady Visitor for Millbank, a London gaol set along the banks of the Thames. As she immerses herself into the lives of the female prisoners Margaret becomes enchanted with one particular prisoner named Selena who is incarcerated for fraud and assault during one of her spiritualist sittings. The relationship between Margaret and Selena develops into deep friendship and love containing aspects of spiritualism that threatens the well being of both women.<br />Similar to FINGERSMITH, Sarah Waters provides enough plot twists and turns to keep the reader's attention along with an unanticipated ending. It was truly difficult for me to put this book down as I simply had to know what was going to happen next. Thinner than her two other novels, AFFINITY still packs a punch by providing an enduring plot with insightful characters. Despite my enjoyment, my main complaint centers on Waters' consistent use (or lack thereof) of quotation marks and punctuation. This aspect often interrupted my flow of reading and soon became a distraction. In addition, the narration often jumped from first to third person and it was somewhat too jolting for my comfort in many sections of the book. Despite these technical qualms I recommend AFFINITY to those who enjoyed her other books (FINGERSMITH and TIPPING THE VELVET) and by fans of Victorian fiction in general.
6303407161|5.0|I confess, I collect pithy lines from films for later use (though, striving to be a person of honour, I try to cite my source as well). Three lines stick in my mind from this film. The first, cited in the title, is from Charles Van Doren's father (played beautifully by veteran actor Paul Scofield), commenting on the prospect of people cheating on the Quiz Show. The second comes from a comment made with regard to Herb Stempel appearing on television: 'Now there's a face for radio.' The third is when Van Doren is contemplating the ethics of his situation, and remarks: 'I'm just trying to imagine what Kant would make of this.'<br />The movie 'Quiz Show' is based upon the true story of 21 and the scandals surrounding a fix in the questions and answers to facilitate ratings. The show 21 has only recently made it back to television.<br />21 was a highly rated NBC programme sponsored by Geritol (back in the days when usually one sponsor carried a show and became identified with it in the minds of the public). The producer, host, and other workers played with the audience by making sure that popular contestants returned, and unpopular ones lost, by rigging the questions. Herb Stempel (played by Tuturro) had a several-month run when it was decided that his popularity had reached a plateau, and a new face was needed. Entering the scene was Charles Van Doren (played by Ralph Fiennes), who in the excitement of fame and money succumbed to the temptation of being given the answers, too.<br />Eventually the government got involved in investigating a fraud (Rob Morrow as Dick Godwin, the investigator, is excellent) related to the show (big play was made about the absolute secrecy of the questions before hand) -- television was not quite in its infancy but was still in its childhood and the public perception was one of trust. When it was revealed that not only was 21 rigged, but that Van Doren had been part of this, the backlash was tremendous, but short-lived.<br />The production team including the host eventually made it back to television, and indeed Herb Stempel even made a television commercial recently as a parody of himself playing a contestant on a quiz show who had just been given the answer.<br />But for Van Doren, whose family was noted for academic achievement, the blow was long-lived, and he was never able to establish a career as an academic again. He did go on to author several books, including one of which I use in reading circles and teaching (The History of Knowledge).<br />What makes the story so remarkable is that most of the people participating were very intelligent. Stempel was a whiz kid at trivia and factual knowledge; Van Doren had a very broad education covering arts and humanities and the natural sciences. If anyone didn't need the help to win, it was these people.<br />Martin Scorsese has a cameo in which he gives the investigator the very real and somewhat painful truth--people ultimately don't care about the knowledge or education or even the honesty of the shows, they just tune in to watch the money. And in fact, that is what has happened with shows today--the recent insurance investigation of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, given claims that the questions are too easy and payouts too large, brings this movie back to mind as the 'anything for ratings' mentality still thrives.<br />A glimpse into a more innocent time that wasn't so innocent after all, this movie works on multiple layers. Now, as I'd like to be on a show myself, does anyone have that Millionaire telephone number?team including the host eventually made it back to television, and indeed Herb Stempel even made a television commercial recently as a parody of himself playing a contestant on a quiz show who had just been given the answer.<br />But for Van Doren, whose family was noted for academic achievement, the blow was long-lived, and he was never able to establish a career as an academic again.

0060977493|4.0|As noted by many other reviewers, the most praiseworthy part of this book is its sensitivity to language. Each word is carefully chosen and manipulated to maximum effect, giving the entire story a lush and delicate tone. The main character is a young girl for most of the story, and although the narrator is 3rd person, Roy writes with the curious imagination of youth, fixing on details others would consider insignificant but giving them great meaning in their context. The narrative is not linear; one gets the feeling of being in a slow spiral, passing by the same moments in the plot multiple times as the story closes in on its final climax. In this way the story is told very much like a memory, as the mind recalls events not as they happened, but as they are connected in their significance. Sometimes this gives the effect of overbearing foreshadowing, but for the most part it's done subtly and beautifully. Roy is a brilliant wordsmith and creates a deeply involving emotional world for her characters. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that the symbolism and foreshadowing were often overstated, but I'd give it 4 and a half if that were an option. With her talent, I fully expect her second novel (if she writes another) to be 5 stars.

B000096FUD|4.0|Lost in La Mancha is a documentary film focusing on Terry Gilliam's failed attempt to film \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\\".  For ten years director Terry Gilliam (Twelve Monkeys, Brazil, The Fisher King) had been trying to get a movie made of Don Quixote made.  It is his dream project.  Unfortunately for Gilliam, it is also a film he has never gotten to make.  Lost in La Mancha covers the six weeks of preproduction and the six days of actual production on the film.<br />Lost in La Mancha is a document of what can go wrong on a film shoot.  During this documentary, a crew member states that if someone would write this story, nobody would believe him.  Everything that could go wrong did go wrong.<br />We see a brief bit about the history of trying to film Don Quixote including Orson Welles' twenty year obsession and ultimate failure to get the movie off the ground.  This leads into Terry Gilliam and his ten year obsession with the same thing.  We begin with the six weeks of preproduction and the principal actors do not have signed contracts and the ones that do are not quite living up to the requirements of the contract.  Costume fittings and rehearsals are being missed and the studio for some of the filming is nothing more than a warehouse with no acoustics to speak of.  Things just have the feel of slipping out of control.  It is suggested that this is the way Gilliam works, but even Gilliam feels that things are slipping.  He mentions the fiasco of Baron Munchausen.  Gilliam states that things are similar.  Munchausen had actors but no costumes or sets.  Don Quixote has costumes and sets but no actors.  The film is slipping away from him.<br />Finally the actors arrive (including Johnny Depp).  There is minimal rehearsal but they are ready to begin.  They are filming the first scenes nearby a NATO bombing range in Spain.  Supposedly NATO only uses it an hour a day.  Filming begins.  NATO flies the fighter jets overhead so that sound is ruined for these scenes.  An extra wasn't there for rehearsal and ruins another shot.  A storm that was not mentioned on any weather report for three days rains down and floods the set.  Not only is equipment partially damaged, it changes the color of the landscape.  Gilliam selected that location because of how it looked.  The color of the dirt has changed because of the rain and mudslides.  The lead actor playing Quixote (a Frenchman) has a prostate infection and can't sit on a horse.  He'll be gone a day, a week, another week.  The film has come to standstill and there has only been six days of actual filming.<br />Finally, Gilliam's movie is done.  Nothing more can be salvaged and it is taken as a loss.  Lost in La Mancha is a fascinating look at the breakdown of a movie (and one that looked like it could be good, too).  I didn't know that a documentary about how a movie didn't get made could be so interesting, but it was.An extra wasn't there for rehearsal and ruins another shot.

B000099T2L|4.0|to start off i would like to say that i love beyonce's voice, i think it is going to take her very far for a long time.  also the first single off of this record os reason enough to buy the cd.  for me i think this is going to be the song of the summer.  it kinda reminds me of a disco dance tune, especially with the horns in the background.  crazy in love is a song i can listen to over and over again, however this song is a little misleading for the rest of the album.  reason being there is not another song like it on the rest of the cd.  beyonce is trying a lot of different types of song and it almost seems like every other song is a duet with someone else.  the one that really stands out for me is the song with sean paul.  for me, he is the coolest singer out right now, i love all of his songs and i think he is bringing something worthwhile to the dearth of good music right now.  his voice is very unique and plays well off of hers.  i dont like the fact that she is kinda taking a mariah carey road and trying top put out rap tunes when she has no business trying.  she is a singer not a rapper, so she should show the people how much potential her pipes really have.  the ballads are the strongest part of the record and many of them seem heartfelt, plus they really show how good her voice is.  this is not a bad cd to invest in and if you want to really groove just listen to crazy in love, it is the best song of the record and of the summer.  go out and buy this record it is worth the price and has a little something for everyone.
B0000028VT|1.0|Just f.y.i. to neil906 or whoever- of course the Spanish version of \\"Hero\\" isn't going to mean the EXACT same thing as the English version! It's like that with MOST translations in music, you're not going to translate WORD FOR WORD because it doesn't work that way! So please let's do our homework before we open our mouths, all right?
0385507755|4.0|Love it or hate it, it is really exciting to see people caring enough about a book to debate it.  I LOVED IT.  I see the arguements against it but they they weren't enough to keep  me from loving the process of reading this author.  Yes, he stammered....so do I when I get insane. Yes, his ego is huge (as a writer and probably a person) but  that's part of having an addictive personality  which added to the truthfulness of the story.   I  was interested enough in the character to hate him and involved enough to love him too. Either way, I am glad I read it myself and didn't  hate it to be controversial or love it to be cool.  I really think it is worth the time it takes to read.  He is an author that, love or hate, we at least  have an opinion about.. . and that has been a long time coming.`
B000002J6H|5.0|The Amazon Reviewer guy must not know...such a pitifal description of this album. Stills includes some of his most astonishing and acomplished guitar and recording saavy on this vinyl. It's a favorite and has been since its release (at my house). Stills' artistry knows what sounds to keep and which to toss and a master who knows how to tease just the right licks out of his instruments and then ices the whole deal in the technical realm as well. Stills is THE de facto cross-over country, island influenced and GREAT rock n roll bluesman of this age. And a real smart man as well, just listen to his lyrics! Congratulations on your brilliance Steven Stills!! This is one of his best recordings ever.....

Guided by a mystical crow, he searches the dark streets looking for the thugs who killed him and his girlfriend.

B00003OSTV|5.0|I have to say that Quod Vadis is a film to make am impression lasting a lifetime.  There was a remake in the eighties, but it never amounted to much and after seeing this grand production it is easy to understand why.  The storyline is decidedly Christian, but in a wonderful way.  By the end you feel uplifted at the thought of being Christian.  We double checked many of the historical facts and yes many of the historical facts are indeed true.  We watched it in two evening due to its length, and if there were a third part I would watch it tonight.  There is not enough good I can say about this movie.
B00006JDVV|4.0|No, &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; is NOT a serious look into the idea of dragons coming back to rule the earth in the 21st century.  What it is, is a study of two ways of dealing with a problem.  First, you can ignore it, live with it, or even comprimise with it.  That's what the British citizens decide as their course of action: live deep underground, and hope the horrid fire breathing beasts go away.  Then there are the American National Guardsman from Kentucky, who decide take the second approach to problem solving: destroy the problem.  The Guardsman discovered that the central lair of the dragon population is somewhere in London, so they commandered a C-5 transport, and brought their dragon extermination program to the UK.<br />Of course there is some conflict between the British and American approach to the problem at hand, and so the Yanks, the Brits and the dragons end up fighting each other.   <br />While the dialogue is mediocre, the action rather predictable, and the special-effects not all that special, still this movie proves to be very entertaining and worth watching just for the shear fun of seeing modern men fighting dragons.
0425166805|4.0|This is one of the funniest \\"Science\\" books ever published.  The rankor in against \\"scientists\\" is only matched by the author's incredible ignorance about Archeology.  But what I found amazing was reading all the reviews by so many people who cry out about the virtues about having an \\"open\\" mind but who don't seem to know the first thing about any of what Von Daniken writes about.  Well what about reading the copius work done about say Twianku in Bolivia, or Tula in Mexico or Cuzco in Peru?  <br />When I was twelve I read \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" and was a believer for about a year.  Then I read a few basic texts about the Maya, Incas, etc., and discovered that Von Daniken was in error so much that well it's a joke.<br />For example the traditional Andean accounts attribute the colossal stone construction at Cuzco and elsewhere in Peru to the Inca Emperors.  And such monumental construction was continueing when the spanish came.<br />As for the Maya Von Daniken's explaination for the Mayan collapse has been exploded and so has his explaination for the Sarchophagus lid from the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, which we know know from being able to read the Mayan Hieroglyphs depicts thee Mayan King Pacal falling into the maw of death down the cosmic tree.  Von Daniken's comment about a inscription about a hot wind describing the death of the man in the Sarcophagus is total invention.<br />Then his book is peppered with absurd comments like stating that a jade necklace found in a Mayan tomb is fantastic because we all know jade only comes from China!.  Well thats not true as even the smallist amount of research would indicate.<br />As for Von Daniken's research by going to various sites; well if you go and are unwilling to listen to what the researchers who have devoted their time to unraveling these sites you will of course view them as \\"mysterious\\".  <br />Von Daniken is a very funny joke and even funnier are those who don't see the joke.
B00009V7T2|5.0|A friend of mine whose favorite band is The Mars Volta told me about this band a few days before the album came out.  I blindly bought this CD and was blown away after my first listen.  After every listen this album just gets better and better.  I know nothing about this band and other previous bands with the members, I do know however that they have quickly become one of my favorite bands.  This singer is simply amazing.  His voice is just as powerful as any other instrument in the band.  He can be likened to the singer of Muse.  The drumming is quite good, tasteful, and clean.  The guitar and bass work are also top notch.  I don't really think of this album as \\"chaos\\" or \\"madness\\", due to the fact that I'm a Meshuggah fan, but you won't know what's coming next on the first listen.  At $... you can't possibly go wrong with buying this album if you're a rock fan.  I honestly believed that Hail To The Thief was the album of the year, until I heard this work of art.
076790592X|2.0|This book was shoved down my throat as a summer reading assignment, so I was coerced into reading it.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie is short (it'll take several hours from start to finish) but is loaded with 14 lessons, each occuring on a different Tuesday before sociologist professor Morrie Schwartz dies. Mitch Albom (\\"player\\") and Morrie (\\"coach\\") discuss a variety of issues from culture, forgiveness, marriage, emotions, to self pity.<br />Those topics should give you a hint at how corny and sappy this book was. While some advice was interesting (creating your own culture and ignoring the mainstream), most of it was clearly said to bring a tear to your eye.<br />Each time Mitch began to talk, Morrie would begin to lecture him (and me) about life, and by the time I reached page 180, I was rolling my eyes thinking, \\"here we go again.\\"<br />Morrie says people try to find happiness in material goods and \\"expect a hug back.\\" As if anything other than love and children will not make you happy. This is non sense. As if people should have no desires and wants. Sure, people blur the distinction between \\"needs\\" and \\"wants,\\" but is it sinful to buy a new car or a new toy? Morrie probably thinks so. Because he never had any material wants, and love and family fufilled his happiness, nobody should ever want material gains but only love.<br />Let's face it, Morrie's a know-it-all. He has good intentions for everybody, but his tone suggests his words are more than advice, but truth.<br />Here's another thing that dumbfounded me. I'm sure Mitch Albom will always cherish this \\"last thesis\\", but in this book he realizes he's been chasing the wrong thing during his adult life: overpriced athletes, pop culture, and above all, evil money. Morrie tells him to reject the culture and instead create one based on his family, friends, and wife. However, the \\"About the Author\\" section explains Mitch is still a columnist and sports reporter for ESPN. I guess all those tears and invaluable advicefrom Morrie didn't deter Mitch from the pop culture.<br />Kevin
B00005QDW5|1.0|What is the point of this album?  Casual Christmas shoppers get a stack of obscure filler mixed with hits.  Fans get nothing new.  Oh, the songs segue into each other. Wow.  And a creative track sequence too. Woo hoo. Pink Floyd rip off their fans again.  Give a decent one disc greatest hits set, or give us a CD of unreleased stuff.
B00005JLYU|1.0|I rarely post one-star reviews here,but this movie,and common morality,demands an attempt to save others from the spirit-crushing,mind-numbing experience of watching this movie.The record number amount of overhype and commericals that preceded the film's release should have been a giveaway.They weren't expecting us to stay long enough to see all of the product placements.OK,where to start...bad writing,bad script,bad directing,bad acting,lousy special effects,zero suspension of disbelief,replacement WITHOUT EXPLANATION of one of the main characters... OK,here's a few things you should consider before spending money on this awful piece of cinema.I'll attempt not to spoil any \\"suprises\\" that may be in store for anyone: 1)Bosley,played by Bill Murray in the first movie,is replaced without ANY explanation by,get this,his black brother.(!)Turns out Bill(Bosley)was adopted and raised in the ghetto,though he apparently cleaned up his diction quite admirably. 2)Sample of the sly,witty humor that permeates the film:One of the Angels is found to have a previous name:Helen Zass.Get it?Haha! Loads of fun are had by all with this nugget of hilarity. 3)In spite of heroic efforts by the director's to expose the Angels in every possible way,the girls look sickly and anorexic.CA2:FT is the least sexy T&A movie I have ever seen.4)The Angels and myriad evil villans have inexplicably acquired super Matrix-like powers.5)I would like to tell the director,whose name appers seven times that I counted(\\"McG\\",I got it),that just because the computers will allow you to achieve some special effect,doesn't mean you SHOULD achieve it. 6)Charaters in this walk through blazing infernos without a scratch,fall and/or jump from heights of over 200 feet and land on the ground perfectly,produce lifelike disguises from nowhere(unless stored in those skimpy outfits),etc.This  movie makes recent 007 flicks look like models for hyper-realistic film-making. 7)In what can only be described as stupendous failure,Mr. McG fails to utilize even a tiny fraction of the talents of some of the best comic actors of our time. You've have been warned.They're not funny,which is irritating,because they SHOULD be. 8)The movie is crammed with pointless cameos from a variety of pop music stars,actors and actresses.These are largely boring and would have been edited out if Hollywood had any sanity left. 9)By the end, I was feeling embarrased for the three big actresses(Cameron Diaz,Lucy Liu,Drew Barrymore),and I got the sense that most of the audience was as well.They strip,perform in a soapy car-wash scene,simulate many lesbian sex acts, and make complete Zasses out of themselves.I suspect that this will be a major career-damaging move for the three actresses. CONCLUSION:If you love the Charlie's Angels franchise,AVOID this film!You can at least PRETEND that it was another fun,sexy,hip,action-packed blast like the first movie was.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is the embodiment of everything wrong with modern music today. The musicianship is nothing that any gang of angst-ridden teens couldn't throw together with the right equipment. The lyrical content is simply an unintellegent pity party. If you are thinking about purchasing this CD, it'd be a wise idea to reconsider. If you really like music letting out anger, frustration and sadness, get it intellegently and with some decent accompanying music, like Beck's &quot;Sea Changes&quot;.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I was a huge Zep fan as a teenager, so much so that I grew a little tired of them in my 20's and 30's. However, when I heard about this release, I felt like I was 15 again. Needless to say, I was not disappointed when I finally bought it. I felt like a kid in a candy store as I jumped from song to song. I've always loved Coda's version of &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; and was pleasantly surprised to see it performed live on disc one. That Albert Hall show really showed what a fantastic live band Zeppelin really was.<BR> Another cool element of the DVD was the visual evolution of the band throughout the 70's. Not only did they play cool music, they were the coolest LOOKING band of all time. That's why teenage boys loved Zep so much. Page and Plant's stage presence was phenomenal. <BR> By the time Knebworth came around in '79, they almost looked like professional businessmen. I know Page was pretty smacked out at this time and Jonesy was basically the musical leader, but it didn't matter. Just watching Page and Plant rip up Achille's Last Stand gave me goosebumps. Great Stuff!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Most official live Zep somehow misses the mark, and we know that they are better than that.  This album is just perfect.  They absolutely nail Rock and Roll and Black Dog this time, and as a bonus we get of sway of rarer live tracks like The Ocean, Dancing Days and The Immigrant Song.  Shame that Tangerine didn't make it.  Fans can now have some sort of closure now, although the obsessive ones would have wanted both shows uncut on two albums.
0385504209|1.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a professional acquaintance.  It was poorly written and substantively odious.  I am tempted to recount the book's astonishingly vast number of factual errors, but for the most part they have been adequately digested in other reviews.  The book's worst element, however, is the obvious bigotry oozing from its pages.  Bottom line: If you liked the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion,&quot; you'll love &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  Or perhaps more disturbingly, if you liked &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; you'll love &quot;The Protocols....&quot;

B00005JM1F|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  I wanted to laugh, I truly did, but the movie just did not provide.  It was lame.  I'm a big fan of college movies (Animal House, Road Trip, Porky's, etc.) and I don't mind a good dosage of crude humor.  However, this movie was not funny at all.  And, to top it off (as I'm sure you've already read), the fact that it is \\"unrated\\" is a total joke.  Three briefly shot sets of breasts (I counted) and some mild cursing. . .this one is closer to PG-13.  This movie is not even worth your four dollars to rent, let alone own.  Trust me on this one.
B00005JLEU|5.0|It is unfortunate that we do not have more movies like this.  A lovely heart-wearming story, filled with strange creatures, however not too strange to feel completly out of this world.  The heroine feels completly real, so much so that one cheers, laughs at, and sometimes gets frustrated by her (but mostly cheers).  There is a magic that the film has that envelopes you and takes you to this beautiful, magical world.  One can almost feel the cool breeze or smell the noxious 'stink spirit.'  Just a completly wonderful story, I just wish that I knew more about japanese culture so that I would enjoy it more.  Then there is the animation.  Again, absolutely wonderfully done, a pleasure to watch.  Disney has not come out with a film this good in a very long time.  Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|4.0|Losing Grip - not so keen on this song at first, but it really grows on you after a few listens.  This is one of the more punk/rock songs, which isn't really my kinda style - 7/10<br />Complicated - totally LOVE this. one of the best songs on the album. really catchy chorus and one of the more poppy songs - 8/10<br />Sk8r Boi - this is quite a pop/punky kinda song. not one of her best songs but still good. has a ROCKIN chorus!!! 7/10<br />I'm With You - first ballad on the album.  one of my faves. chorus is really catchy and good to sing along too - 8/10<br />Mobile - my least fave so far. it's quite repetitive and drags on and on like a Badly- Drawn Boy type song, but still quite catchy - 6/10<br />Unwanted - this is a little like Losing Grip in that it is a big punky/rock kinda song.  it is really angst-driven and turn it up loud if u really like rocking!!! - 6/10<br />Tomorrow - one of the slower songs on the album, where Avril's voice really does shine.  it's quite catchy and good to be played when you've had a really bad day - 7/10<br />Anything But Ordinary - my fave song on the album.  it goes along the lines of complicated, and is really catchy and good to sing along to.  it's one of the more poppy tracks - 9/10<br />Things I'll Never Say - my 2nd fave song.  its got a big catchy chorus, and quite Alanis Morisette-style, you just cant stop singing along - 9/10<br />My World - another really good song, but it has some really weird lyrics.  quite catchy but not one of the stand-out tracks - 8/10<br />Nobody's Fool - Oh my God, Avril tries rapping!!!!  quite a decent song, but a little on the repetitive side - 7/10<br />Too Much Too Ask - this is probably my least fave song.  it's a bit on the dark/moody side, and doesn't really get going, although it's still quite catchy - 6/10<br />Naked - good song to end the album on.  It's quite catchy and the verses are really cool - 7/10<br />Overall a Really godd debut album from Avril.  it's a mixture of pop and rock,but the majority is more poppy.  don't buy it if you're looking for a more punk/rock album, coz only about four of the songs can fit this description.  COOOOOOOL!!!!!

B00008PC2O|1.0|Scanning the various DVD sets available it's apparent the number of colourful but meaningless prefixes utilised for your products. `Ultimate Collection', `Special Edition', `Collector's Edition', not to mention the so-called `Limited Edition'.<BR>  <BR>The dictionary definition of `Ultimate' is Final, last, definitive, yet Artisan release the Extreme edition, surely this breaches the Trades Description Act 1968: Which prohibits false or misleading descriptions of goods or services.<br />  An improved way to make sure consumers are not tricked into buying inferior DVD editions is to have a clear warning and table on the back of the packaging stating: \\"This DVD has been altered from what the director intended, various scenes have been cut or deleted\\" followed by a list of the scenes and their specific time slots. This way the consumer can make an informed choice, knowing exactly what they are buying.<br /> Production studios must realise fans such as myself are becoming very exhausted and bored with such commercial antics, hence why a majority of us purchase from other countries. if this continues we will loose great faith in companies such as Artisan and end up just waiting this the film is released in a final ultimate box set, even though when you believe it is the final version, an improved set is released...<br />Will Artisan be willing to send a copy of the Extreme edition to all fans that purchased the Ultimate edition free of charge if the consumer has proof of purchase? Only then they may convince me to own the Extreme Edition DVD set.<br />Although Terminator 2 is an all time classic, the attitude to the consumer from produciton studios is dubious and wearing thin, hence 1 star.
0688156819|5.0|I grabbed a copy of this book straight off the shelves of a local book store as I had been a long time admirer of Tim Burton's works, having caught most of his movies. Contrary to some of the reviews, I did read them to my children aged 5 and 7 who shared the humor in almost a macabre manner. But I had to censor some of them out for their unsuitability. Yet, they could enjoy the poems over and over again, especially the Staring Girl and Roy The Toxic Boy. The Toxic Boy does actually provide a lesson in oxone layer depletion and it was an appropriate platform to teach the children about damage to the environment. In their child-like purity, they see read the book as it is without prejudices but I would advise a lot of parental guidance for the nature of the materials. I had intentionally skipped references to sex in the poems but they still enjoyed it for the level of humor that they perceive. For adults, it has a lot of deeper levels of meaning which at once is humorous, tragic and makes one reflect a lot about children and the sometimes tormented existence they lead.
B00009V7P8|5.0|My first reaction is simply \\"wow\\". Damien Rice is one of the purest singers to come out of Ireland in years. This CD is truly a shining light in the growing \\"young\\" Singer/Songwriter genre.<br />In a short 10 songs, you'll find yourself wating more.<br />The best parts are his beautiful harmonies with Lisa Hannigan. Where most singers would limit her time on the album (for fear of sharing the glory), he has her in almost every song. His falsetto with her soprano create a \\"chime-like\\" chord.<br />He is a haunting lyricist and sings those words with a shocking honesty that pull you into them. You almost hear his voice crack from the pain. The lyrics are deep and sad, without being whiny or trite. \\"I give you miles and miles of mountains and you ask for the sea.\\"<br />Wow.
0156027321|2.0|Starting out, I thought \\"Life of Pi\\" might be a good book, one that could lead someone to \\"believe in God\\" as the front cover advertised.  However, as Pi was left to wander the Pacific by sea, the book quickly turned into a theological disappointment.  I will admit that it's hard for a western mind to hold the ideas of Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism at peace within oneself at the same time, and I was disappointed that Martel didn't delve at all into the differences between them.  The incident in the cafe between the three religious leaders and Pi's parents offered me hope that a cursory review of the religious controversies was to follow, but it did not.  If I'm ever stuck in the Pacific on a lifeboat for a couple of months, I feel somewhat better prepared.  However, this book didn't offer what I expected to find in this book--an inclusivist understanding of God through the focused lenses of Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism.  I realize Martel may intend \\"Pi\\" for a younger audience, but \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is certainly more mature, in it's story depth and in it's theology.
B00004TH83|5.0|This cd is really great! I can't stop listening to it...<BR>She's an incredible singer with an extraordinary voice and beautiful songs...<BR>Celine, Mariah and Whitney aren't by far as gifted as Lara so stop writing that nonsense.<BR>If you want to compare Lara with other singers than Laura Pausini is the only one who, in my opinion, shares the same level of talent...
B000092ZYY|2.0|Their problem with self-importance is getting old. I loved The Bends and OK Computer, but I don't see how anyone could be intellectually honest and think this is good. If I want to listen to musical experiments then I'll put on late period Coltrane or Schoenberg. Different or experimental does not equal good. This is not good. Rock experiments usually don't work so I think I'll put on Beggars Banquet.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is just great. I had thought it was a pure kids movie, but when I watched it I fell in love with it. What a great story, and the animation was excellent. I highly recommend this flick to anyone with a heart.
B000069CWE|4.0|I listen to all of the songs off of Reanimation, and I usually don't like most remixes. But I like most of the remixes on this CD. Pts. of Authority, KRWLNG, 1 Stp Klsr, and In the End are my favorites. Overall: 8/10.
0385504209|5.0|Mr Brown has taken the research of scholars and produced a thriller/mystery that's bound to entertain and educate.  The book is fast-paced and impossible to put down.  A hard-core mystery fan, I haven't enjoyed a read like this in...a very, very long time.
014028902X|4.0|Bit of a classic. Recollections through the eyes (but not the vocabulary) of a ten year old of family and insects/snakes/birds on Corfu. Funny characterisations, well retold anecdotes of eccentrics (including this biology mad kid). Similarities to Herriot. Interesting that the animal obsessed writer, inspirer of many of today's naturalists, is still of his generation enough to see no tension between being fascinated by animals in this idyllic setting - or going out shooting with his brother.
0553260111|5.0|My husband and I saw the movie based on this book, and he went right out and bought this book. He read and highly recommended it. Although it's not my regular genre, I started reading and couldn't put it down! It is so thrilling, and so much better than the movie. If you are like me - liked the movie and wanted to know more about Jason Bourne - this book is definitely for you!

0156027321|5.0|first of all, i am a 14 y/o boy in Aus. i have never even LOOKED at amazon.com before. but when i read L.O.P. i became so totally engrossed with it by the end that i had to write a review here.<br />yann martel's novel is compelling, moving, spectacularly descriptive, and honestly the best book i have ever read.  i became entranced with the look into Pi's life and mind. the way martell brings the world to life, and keeps the book crackling with life, is fare beyond me. but i have honestly never read a better book.<br />just as it says, L.O.P. makes you believe in god. with a mix of fantasy, descriptive text, and realism, Martell has created a novel worthy of the Man Booker prize.<br />i can guarantee this to any semi-literate teen. <br />outstanding
B00006V9A0|1.0|If you want the bottom line, here it is: This Nirvana album is an unecessary CD with unecessary remastering. All their albums before this are four star albums, but this comilation's a throwaway. If you still want it, though, ignore whomever suggested to download You Know You're Right &quot;for Kurt&quot;. Instead, borrow it from your local library and transfer it. That way, you can support your public library, and get the the previously unreleased song you want the album for. Kurt loved spending time at his library, so I'm sure the idea I suggested would hake him a lot happier. Everyone has the rest of the songs on this compilation, so there's no point in saying much about them besides the fact that the remastering is nothing special. One thing I noticed about the remastering is that the drums are higher up in the mix, and so are the vocals, which means the guitar/bass aren't as prominent. Like I said, the library has this CD, so try it out. For Kurt.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album changed my life.  Truly brilliant! Thom Yorke's crooning voice, the delicious melodies, and the incredible lyrics touch deep down into your soul.  The way it made me feel is inexpressible.  Any person who disliked this album, simply put, is not worthy to be listening to this caliber of music anyway.  A BSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!
B00005JLKB|5.0|usually i would not spend money for a whole season of a show, but I think ill buy it cause im addicted to it.  kristen kreuk is the coolest. azn pride all the way!!!!!!!!!!
B00000253N|1.0|I recently purchased \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" from a local music store. I'm a big fan of classic rock and coutless others said that no classic rock fan without giving Bob Dylan a whirl.  <BR>I just can't believed how critics praised this thing as if it were sliced bread. So many people have overated this as one of the best concept albums ever made. Now some albums such as \\"Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\\", \\"Eldorado\\", \\"Quaddrophina\\", and others work at entertaining the listeners depending on what the subject is and how it is delivered. Bob Dylan chose breaking up with his wife. Ok that sounds like a good story to follow through as long as its entertaining and shows meaning. Well on this particular album it just doesn't work and ole Bobby should have withdrawn it soon before it was released. You see most albums consist of guitar, drums, piano, drums, and other instruments to mesmorize the listener. Blood On The Tracks hardly makes use of these ear candy toys. Most of the tracks are slow and just plain BORING! Also they are drowned out by Dylan's annoying hillbilly voice. Tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 only consists of accoustic guitar and very aggrivating harmonica. Tracks 1, 4, and 7,(the only fast song) have drums, organ, piano, and the rest listed above. these are the only ones that are listenable. Don't buy this album unless your a big fan of slow accoustic guitar songs without any depth.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent has relased an interestin' album. \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\". I'll rate the songs on the CD of out 10<br />1 - Intro : Coin dropping into a slot machine. Not much and I think an intro will be dropped next time - 5/10<BR>2 - What Up Gangsta : Pretty good beat to it. 7/10<BR>3 - Patiently Waiting : Now this song to me is the best one on the CD. It has a terrific beat to it. Good rapping from 50 Cent and awesome freestylin' from Em. Should of been a single for sure. 9.5/10<BR>4 - Many Men : Not too bad. Has a weak thing about it. Title soundz weak. 7/10<BR>5 - In Da Club : Would be an awesome song except the radio has reckt it. 8/10<BR>6 - High All The Time : Didn't think much of it first off, but soon as I got into it, kinda catchy. 7.5/10<BR>7 - Heat : For some reason very loud. Um, good beats and good rappin' 8/10<BR>8 - If I Can't : mmm, I like this. Very good backing music. 50 raps nicely in this. Very \\"Dre-ish\\" IMO. 8/10<BR>9 - Blood Hound : Strange beginning. Good rappin' 7/10<BR>10 - Back Down : GGG-Unit!! Very good story tellin' song. A Ja Rule diss and a very good one at that! 9/10<BR>11 - P.I.M.P : Low point of the CD. Not suited to 50 IMO. Heard this was a single comin' out. Sad to say, but I see alot of JA Rule in this. hmm. Also too \\"pop\\". 3/10<BR>12 - Like My Style : It's alright. Not a song I listen to much. Not very strong. 5/10<BR>13 - Poor Lil Rich : Need to listen to this song more I think. Has a Nintendo type tune in the song. Ok rappin' 4/10<BR>14 - 21 Questions : Features Nate Dogg. Not sure why this is a single. It's ok, but again not a 50 rap IMO. More of a Nate Dogg song. 6.5/10<BR>15 - Don't Push Me : Eminem influenced. Has a good background sound, good rappin' by 50 and Em. 8/10<BR>16 - Gotta Make It To Heaven : Has a catchy background sound wit the Nintendo noises. Um, solid rappin' by 50. 7/10<BR>BONUS CUTZ - <BR>17 - Wanksta : Obvious tune to most people. I like the background tune and the rappin' ain't bad. 8/10<BR>18 - U Not LikeMe : Alright beat and solid rappin' once again. When you first listen to the song at the start has a similar \\"Eminem - Business\\" to it. 7/10<BR>19 - Life's On The Line : Thankfully a bonus 6.5/10<br />Overall, a decent album (8/10) although a few songz on there have let down this album a bit (P.I.M.P, 21 Questions, Like My Style and the Intro). Could of been awesome. Would love to see more great tunes by 50 (like Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, Back Down, If I Can't and Don't Push Me)
B000063DI9|5.0|WELL IRON MAIDEN SURE CAN! HAHA i had low expectations of this cd, because i hear they will be toying with synths - and i prayed this wouldnt turn out like the almighty judas priest's turbo lover did. but it didnt, it only helps getting theese awesome songs get caught in your head. awesome metal cd, 3rd best maiden disc ever. GO GET IT!!!!! seventh son of a seventh son is radical!!!!
B00003CX8V|4.0|...that's how C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is summed up in the early going of this one.  It's not that this is untrue -- strictly speaking, Baxter is just that, a nebbish.  Yet we love him all the more for it.  He is, however, a nebbish with a misplaced sense of propriety.  To shuck and jive for the married executives at the insurance company where he labors among the other grunts in order for them to enjoy their extra-marital daliances is his one major flaw.<br />Forunately, there is Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) to unwittingly calibrate Baxter's moral barometer.  No point in telling how she does it -- that'd spoil the movie.  Rest assured that it's one of the best Billy Wilder-Jack Lemmon collaborations (second only to 'Some Like It Hot')<br />While it's great to have it on DVD, you'd think they would have kicked in with some kind of special features (this was, after all, the Oscar winner for best picture in 1960).  Alas, that is not the case here.  You get the movie, the trailer...and that's it.
0060934719|5.0|Like reading a dream. The book flows wonderfully, blending a series of well-known myths, children's tales and YGMFL (your grandmother's folklore) into a very fine story that also reflects upon real life. It is a small book and a quick read, but I've found myself reaching for it and reading a few pages at random since it is so enjoyable; there are very few books in my library that I can say this about - most of my paperbacks I resell or lend out to friend never to see again, but not this one. Also, the shortness does not at all diminish the feeling of a journey and an adventure.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I have been searching the web for a copy of this AMAZING movie for years, and could not find a copy (okay, that wasn't on Beta, ridiculously over-priced, or required a translator to purchase)and FINALLY the distributor came to their senses and re-released this gem!<br />This movie is, simply put, one of the finest examples of modern dance, with a quirky but telling story line, and a great cast.  Say what you will about \\"Chicago\\", which is a fine movie in it's own right, but \\"All That Jazz\\" is sublime, and Ann Reinking proves once again why she was Bob Fosse's muse.  No one has ever been able to interpret Fosse the way she can, and Roy Scheider is wonderful in his lusty performance of Fosse's alter ego.  <br />Let's hope that more of these forgotten greats start getting resurrected!
B000063DFQ|5.0|this album is the 2nd best of all the  maiden albums, 2nd only to the classic number of the beast. you gotta get this cd, with has some of the best maiden songs (flight of icaurus, the trooper) and is just great to head bang too. awesome material to come from probably the best british metal band ever! you must get this disc, CLICK THE ORDER BUTTON now. highly reccomended, killer british metal! classic.
6304474652|5.0|Fools Rush In was such a funny and hilarious movie. Salma Hayek and Matthew Perry were great and it was a story of true love. Five stars~I recommend it to anyone. You'll love it!
0380820846|5.0|I found this book quite good.  The only problem is that I read it first, before I read any of the other Bridgerton books.  If you haven't read them first, go back and do so, then read this installment.  The novel stands along quite well by itself, but yes, the beloved Lady Whistledown is revealed.  So while the other stories are great on their own, you lose that sense of &quot;mystery&quot; of who the brutally honest lady is.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I agreed. She's got the looks and voice, &amp; could easily get a 3-star. But the problem is, if you're a true jazz lover, you'll find it overrated. One wonders why she grabbed so Grammies.... the quality of the music industry is plummeting i guess. Anyway, if u just wanna get some easy-listening music, this will suffice.
B000056WTC|5.0|Well... Bruce Lee's in it. Need I say more?
B000068MFS|5.0|This movie was so great. I give it two thumbs up. It's one of those movies you can just watch over and over again. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
0064407667|1.0|I just finished this book, which I read since someone recommended it to my son and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I am a fan of children's books and read them often... I do have an imagination, but I hated this book.  I did like the writer's style and some of the characters, however cannot comprehend why people would find the abuse of children entertaining.  If you want to read about clever children escaping danger and strange predicaments, I recommend the Spiderwick Chronicles.  There is adventure, good characters, and no child abuse...  I would not want to pass it along to anyone.
B00005QDW5|3.0|They should have added one more disc to the album,this one would have the tracks that were rejected.The ones that everybody is complaining about(Welcome To The Machine,Have A Cigar,Mother,Run Like Hell,Brain Damage,and tracks from &quot;More&quot;,&quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot;,&quot;Ummagumma&quot;,and &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;
B00005N8JG|5.0|I just happened to pick this up on a recent trip to Australia.  I had heard it playing in a store I was in and decided on buying it.  After listening to it daily for the rest of my trip the CD quickly made it to my favorites list.  Simply put, this is an amazing debut release.  You'll enjoy it on the first listen, and love it by the second.
B0000025YL|5.0|If you don't like 80's metal, why are you even listening to it Jeffery?  You must be a nu metal freak!  Go listen to Linkin park or whoever they are and just go away.  This is easily the best Accept album and a great true metal CD. 80's metal rules!
B000001ED1|5.0|When I said her name to my friends none of them knew who she was. It's not fair, it's not fair for the reason she is one of the most talented singers I've heard so far; she's got the blues the rock and the voice to be one of the most shinig stars of rock music though she will never be that great considering she doesn't fit into that pink Britney world, 'cause she has got voice! And the way she uses it is more than impressive.<br /> The most important thing you must do is to forget about 'One of us' before you listen to this album.<br />1. St Theresa - Good starting her voice sounds like if she was singing from the distance<br />2. Man in the long black coat - Bob Dylan cover so it must be good, though a little bit too monotonous.<br />3. Right hand man - The first song wherein she really shows what she's got / My mother came into the room while I was listening that one and enquire if I had gone mad that I started listening some REAL music - big words from her:-)/<br />4. Pensacola - Wow! The way it starts is fantastic<br />5. Dracula Moon - It's an ok song<br />6. One of us - All times favourite song about the Lord. She was declared heretic for this one but I think the Church just couldn't get it.<br />7. Ladder - My favourite song with a really good rock rythm<br />8. Spider web - Also quite hard and old-fashioned<br />9. Let's just get naked - I have a feeling that she sings in a low-key that one, she should have put more passion in it<br />10. Help me - The musical background and her voice are perfect in this one<br />11. Crazy baby - I don't really like this one, the reason might be that she wrote it by herself<br />12. Lumina - Perfect ending; slow and light with soft guitar accompaniment<br />Altogether I can say that if you like classic rock and singers with unusual voices you must buy it, but please think twice about it if you expect all the songs to be like 'One of us'
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can hardly believe it at times when I listen tot his girl sing. It's like she has the best voice in the world for here tender age of 22. Not even Whitney and Mariah had that when they were her age. It's powerful, forceful, gentle, soothing, soft, melodius and deep.<br />Not even Beyonce Knowles can compare.<br />Even when the lyrics don't sound that good, Christina manges to let her voice soar the song to it's fullest potential.<br />Get this CD - if only for the song 'Beautiful'. SOme other great songs are 'The Voice Within', 'Impossible' and 'Walk Away'.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the biggest suprises of year 2003 beside t.A.T.u. They are fresh unusual and exactly not a copy of Linkin Park. They are much more talented than them and what is more they can play soft music as well. All of their songs reflects the feelings of theirs. And if it meets with your feelings you can't help listening to it over and over again./ it helped me to get throught a huge emotional crisis/<br />1. Going under - Perfect song to begin an album; it's frustrated and quiet painful 4.5/5<BR>2. Bring me to life - The first single which really kicks arse and gives you the feeling to scream all your frustration out of you 5/5<BR>3. Everybody's fool - I'm not really fond of this because it is a bit too usual for them me thinks 3/5<BR>4. My Immortal - It not only has a very good rythm nut also very meaningful lyrics and the piano is perfect. 5/5<BR>5. Haunted - Another uptempo song with cool lyrics 4/5<BR>6. Tourniquet - That is the one which has the unusual lyrics<BR>and the tempo as well to deserve 5 stars; drugs&God 5/5 <BR>7. Imaginary - This one is rather spoiled; it starts with a fantastic rythm but unfortunately it becomes too heavy 3/5<BR>8. Taking over me - I extraordinarily  like this one maybe because I feel the same now 5/5<BR>9. Hello - Like 'My immortal' it's another pianist song and it's as good as the one I've mentioned. It's lyric is rather catching 5/5<BR>10. My last breath - Another usual song it has quiet catching lyrics so 3/5<BR>11. Whisper - Something fresh for the end with cool lines and cracking beats 5/5<br />The reason I gave this cd 5 stars is that they brought some life into today's rock music and are not another punk band or a clone of Linkin Park.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is a great CD, in my opinion This new member Fergie is OK,I think she tries a little bit too hard when she's on stage. I'm partial to the original fellas they're who I fell in love with in 1998. They're talented on their own why add this new chic? But I guess I'll give her a chance, she does have chops...The album is eclectic, if you're not into this genre of hip-hop It may take you a while to get it. These are let's have a good time songs mixed with a little rock, salsa, old-school something for everyone to enjoy, and it's something that younger kids can listen to they're a pretty clean descent group. The songs on this album are just good ole make ya wanna dance music. If you've ever seen the live you know what I'm talkin' 'bout! If you haven't check them out when they come to your town.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta's founding members Cedric Bixler Zivala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez of At the Drive-In take the next step forward on this umbilical blistering debut. Breaking free from the typical boundaries of rock music the Undeground Emperors fuse their own blend of numerous genres into a rollercoaster ride that will double you're heart rate and possibly strand you in a dreamworld you don't want to leave. Omar's guitar keeping you on your toes at all times crossed w/ the masterful sound manipulations of Jeremy Ward (R.I.P., he will be greatly missed) creates an passionatelyustoppable dynamic. Cedric is at his best, more passionate than ever as he guides us through the story of his good friend Julio Venegas' weeklong coma as he contemplated between life and death before awaking to commit suicide. This is hands down the best album of 2003. Go out and buy it, you won't be disappointed

B00005CDNK|5.0|No not really, but close.... 1981 \\"The Visitors\\" was as just as drastic a departure from 1980's \\"Super Trouper\\" as Brian Wilson's classic 1966 \\"Pet Sounds\\" was from \\"Beach Boys Party\\".    I bought this album new in 1981 and I was surprised how somber and serious it was. I was expecting another fun upbeat Pop album from them, but here were songs about the end of relationships, the fear of a Russian invasion during the cold war, children growing-up fast, and the final disillusionment of childhood/adolescent dreams into adulthood. Not something you'd expect from a group that gave us \\"Sitting in The Palmtree\\" \\"King Kong Song\\" and \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\" 5-6 years before! ABBA was showing signs of maturing from 1977's \\"Arrival\\" LP on, but \\"The Visitors\\" is the album where the group had finally grown up.    Despite the upbeat melodies and sing-along choruses the whole album has a sense of impending doom about it - Perhaps it's the all-digital production with the increased use of drum machines and synthesizer programming that creates the chilly sonic atmosphere. There's a couple of fun songs like \\"Two For The Price Of One\\" (which made me gag back then - but I now find charming) but the optimistic \\"bouncy\\" energy of ABBA's earlier albums is gone.    But Benny & Bjorn didn't lose their touch for writing memorable songs and crafting big and beautiful productions. The whole album just sucks me in - the track listing isn't as haphazard as earlier ABBA albums, it seems to flow just right.    ABBA started working on a album tentatively called \\"Opus X\\" (their 10th album) and recorded a few tracks like the amazing \\"Just Like That\\" (a edited version made the \\"Thank You\\" box set but us fans want the full version with all the verses!) and \\"In the City\\" (which made ABBA Gold Volume 2). But creative and personal differences broke up the foursome for good.     Had ABBA stayed together, could they have made a album that would have changed jaded rock critics and \\"serious\\" music fans mindsthat thought ABBA was just a \\"bubblegum\\" group? ...Well we will never know! But we have this great send off to the best Scandinavian Pop group of the 70's and early 80's.
B00005NWM3|4.0|keep rock alive! its not the best cd but its still alot better than some of the cr@-p out there. i dont think it should be played as mush as it is. however people are just over thinking it. its music. it's really easy stuff to play. but its no different than playing slayer power cords over and over and its no more repetitive sounding than a slayer album.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I love this album.  I should note that I almost gave up on KC after &quot;Constriktion&quot;.  This album fuses their hard, almost indutrial sounding, prog with more subtle and techno textured atmospheres (Blip-Hop-esque effects).  Looking around the internet I found a lot of good said about this album which lead to my purchase of it... I'm back to say that those other reviews were right on the money.  Put away the Linkin Park, Incubus, and Audioslave, tune into some 50-somethings that KNOW how to get it done right ;).  Next to Radiohead's latest, this is the 'hippest' album I've bought this year.
0345457684|5.0|This is one of those rare books I just couldn't put down.  I started reading it on a Saturday night, and I hated to stop to sleep... then spent all day Sunday reading until the end.  I loved this book.<br />With all the focus on the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or &quot;Matrix&quot; parts of the story, I think more emphasis should be placed on the &quot;noir&quot; aspects of this novel.  It's a great detective story, and the technology aspects simply add to the atmosphere, but they also add some compelling questions and ruminations on the nature of self. <br />I can't wait for the next novel from this author.  He's got talent.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is incredible.  I thought that Beyonce would have a bunch of bubblegum pop/R&B mess on here, but the album is stricly R&B.  She's even got a few songs that sound like they could have been written during the 70s when classic soul music was made (\\"Speechless\\" and \\"Gift from Virgo\\").  The best songs on the album are the five or six mid-tempo songs in the middle of the album.  She cleverly samples old school songs that haven't already been sampled fifty million times.  And the lyrics are actually meaningful (I don't know what she was thinking about when she wrote \\"Bootylicious\\".)  This is one album that I can almost listen to from beginning to end.  The only two songs I don't like are the other song she did with Jay-Z (\\"That's How you Like It\\") and the Donna Summer rip-off (\\"Naughty Girl\\").
B00005JLKB|5.0|I never usually watch a series but my god this is the best, excellent in all departments, sell it to me now, cant wait for the next series, but i will have that also, bring on september for that dvd, what brilliance.
B000001DVD|5.0|Before PYROMANIA, HYSTERIA, and EUPHORIA there was HIGH N DRY, their 2nd album from 1981.  This is one of my all time favorite albums.  This is the &quot;heavy metal&quot; Def Leppard before PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA.  It is is 22 years later and I still consider this their best album.  If you only know the band by their &quot;hit&quot; CDs, then this CD will not sound like the same band to you.  I like the other albums but this one is without a doubt, their most rockin'.  Songs like &quot;Another Hit And Run&quot;, &quot;You Got Me Runnin'&quot; and &quot;Let It Go&quot; are up tempo guitar heavy tracks and &quot;Switch 625&quot; is a very cool short instrumental.  The band tried another instrumental years later on the &quot;Euphoria&quot; CD but it wasn't that good to be honest.  A must buy for any Def Lep fan old and new. A NWOBHM(new wave of british heavy metal) classic. Also check out &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot; by Judas Priest and &quot;Killers&quot; by Iron Maiden.  These 3 bands, in my opinion, defined british rock in the early and mid-80's.
0875845851|5.0|When it comes to pathbreaking management thoughts, I refer to this book as the best I have read in the last few years. We see change around us all the time, but never accept it. This book shows why we neglect change and what are its implications.<BR>A must read for all budding entrepreneurs, leaders, managers, students...
B00008PX8P|5.0|Arguably one of the biggest(and probably best)live acts in the world, everybody was going around saying Led Zeppelin was one of the best live acts in the world...problem was there wasn't a basis for comparison: one live flawed movie The Song Remains the Same and that's pretty much it despite some rather dismal sound quality bootlegs. A huge undertaking results in one of the biggest sounding dvd's so far.<br />The first disc contains a single concert filled with some memorable moments(Page's violin-esque solo on Dazed and Confused, John Bonham's beast-like drumming on Moby Dick, and Page's big solo on White Summer). The extras are mainly television appearances(including a bit bad mimed version of Communication Breakdown). <br />Disc 2 is the big one, featuring 3 major sets and one live song by itself(Immigrant Song). The big memorable moment for me on this one? No not Stairway to Heaven which is always good, it was Achilles Last Stand. This thing is epic and huge and when it does this big military pounding like section mainly by the drums, just makes you go \\"ooooohhh\\". The extras are mainly interviews with the band and 2 promo videos. <br />All in all this is what the big wait was for.
B0000029PC|4.0|Much as there is to admire in this set, Wolfgang Sawallisch &amp; the Dresden Staatskapelle on EMI own the Rosette for their rendering of the Schumann symphonies.
B00009V7RF|1.0|The Black Eyed Peas took a 180 degree turn with this album.  Their first two albums had the boomin' beats, meaningful lyrical content, and interesting overall sound to show that they were a hip hop group that stepped away from the mainstream sludge that MTV churned out everyday.  They were a group that had a hit here and there but remained true to their message and kept hip hop fresh and new.  Like Mr.Lif and the Roots, the Black Eyed Peas were a trio that everyone should've known about and enjoyed.    So out comes Elephunk with its phunky beats and sexy lyrics.  Lots of booty, lots of foot tapping.  But overall, it's rather boring.  The lyrics aren't there, (unless you really need to hear another song about shapely women and what  would like to do with them) and after awhile the beats get monotonous.  They also add a rap-reggae track (\\"Hey Mama\\", which is horrible) and a serious relationship song (\\"Shut Up\\", which is ok), but nowhere is the sound of their previous two albums.  The only song that takes a break from the meat market and gets a cocktail is \\"The Apl Song\\", a quiet, pretty song about apl.de.ap's childhood.  That's about it.    It's been 2.5 years since Behind the Front and admittedly, groups change over time.  BEP's change just seems a bit too drastically mainstream-oriented, (like the new ones from Jewel and Liz Phair).  Go get Behind the Front and Bridging the Gap instead and hope BEP take the first U-Turn they see.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist was the winner of Academy Awards for Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Director (Roman Polanski) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ronald Harwood), as well as the Golden Palm at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, among other awards and honors. It is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by Brody), a Polish Jew and concert pianist who eluded the Nazi death camps and survived the war by hiding in the ruins of Warsaw. I agree with most of the reviews below as to the quality of the film and its acting -- all the awards are well-deserved.<br />It should be noted that there are several interesting minor characters in the film as well. Perhaps the most memorable is the Nazi officer (based on a real person) who helps Szpilman toward the end of the film.  But also notable are Szpilman's family members, as well as the crazy lady searching for her husband, Szpilman's lost love, the \\"Pied Piper\\" character, etc. All add depth and color to the drama of a world gone mad.
B000099T2L|5.0|This Long Play has to be the best album by a child of Destiny. Beyonc¨¦ Knowles¡¯ highly anticipated debut surely doesn¡¯t disappoint. <br />At first I was hesitating like I did with Christina-A¡¯s Stripped, but I¡¯m glad I bought this CD. She is one of the most talented singer / song-writer / producer in the music business. Other high-class talents like that will have to be Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys and Lamya. <br />If you¡¯re hesitating, trust and believe me!!! You won¡¯t be sad after it. <br />Reasons why I didn¡¯t purchase it: <br />Crazy¡­ was a bit disappointing at first, but after a while I got into it. <BR>Work It Out really bored me <BR>The names of the tracks weren¡¯t too appealing <BR>I¡¯m not a huge fan of Destiny, I sort of hated Beyonc¨¦ a bit before.

B00005JKGI|5.0|OK - this was supposed to be released last year.  What's going on?  The UK version WAS released, so why are we still waiting over here?  Is it something to do with that dumb remake?
B000056HE9|4.0|A great movie at Christmas or year round for that matter. Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven, and Monty Woolley are fantastic. The mix of drama and comedy are prefect.<br /><br />Anyone that enjoys Cary Grant of David Niven will love this movie. The director does a great job of keeping us enchanted with just enough reality and a hint of heavenly powers. The sets, music, and supporting cast are excellent.<br /><br />I hope we will see another classic movie with Monty Woolley put on DVD, The Pied Piper (1942), which has him rescuing children from occupied France during WWII. I can't even find it on VHS.<br /><br />The quality of this movie is excellent. They did a great job of restoring it and transferring it to DVD. There are a few extras included, but the movie alone is worth the price.
6304806442|5.0|Trainspotting was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I have to say this DVD is [bad] when it comes to extras. The only good thing you'll get out of this DVD is that it is the original Director's Cut. Even though it doesn't say on the case, it is. There's a website I found with DVD Easter Eggs. This Director's Cut of Trainspotting is the Easter Egg with cuts restored from the Theatrical Version. However, I have the Canadian DVD, and  it's better, because it has Deleted scenes and interviews. It's very Rare now, but there's a website somewhere that still carries limited copies. Be warned. The Canadian DVD version is cut, though you still get the features I mentioned above. I recommend you buy both. This is a great movie no matter what.
B000094DUP|5.0|I love Delta's voice and her songs! Sort of a mix between Mariah carey and Kelly Clarkson.Especially Born to try and innocent eyes.  This cd is deffinely worth the money!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I think my title explains it all. The movie was absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe it. The only thing I didn't like...but it was awesome anyway, was that the battle of Helm's Deep was 1/3 of the movie. But then there is the directer's cut. (Sorry Peter, I know you hate directer's cuts!!!) Some stuff from the book wasn't in the movie.  But I think it would be rather hard to adapt such an amazing book, into an amazing movie. It was done! And it was 3 hours long. But DEFINENTLY worth sitting through again and again. (I did) Peter Jackson over-powers any other directer. It was brilliant. Howard Shore's music score for the movie can't even be described with words. I couldn't believe how fantastic it was. It matched the mood of what was happening in the movie. Also...there is the cast. I don't think they could've done better with the casting. From Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, to Gollum and the CG Ents. It was AMAZING. Everybody was perfect for their part.  (This is getting too long, so I'm leaving you now) But don't take my word for it, BUY THE MOVIE. It's a burden if you don't...like Frodo carrying the One Ring. Hee hee hee...just buy it. :)
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I got my first taste of Ryan Adams with &quot;New York, New York&quot; and immediately purchased &quot;Gold.&quot;  I was not disappointed.  On the whole, &quot;Gold&quot; is a fantastic introduction to a considerable talent.  (&quot;Heartbreaker&quot; may have been his solo debut album, but &quot;Gold&quot; is the more accessible disc for neophytes.)  Adams is best when he cuts loose (the bouncy, joyful &quot;Firecracker&quot; and &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me More&quot;) and when he's lovelorn (&quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; and the heartachingly beautiful &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;).  While I agree that some of the songs are plodding (&quot;Enemy Fire&quot; especially) and the disc is a little too long, there is something here for just about everyone.  Definitely worth the price of admission.
B000063K2W|4.0|For those who are wondering about the quality of the transfer (and already know that the quality of the movie itself is excellent):  the picture is exceptionally bright, and I'm not sure if it's because of the way it was lit or because of the transfer itself.  Picture is not grainy at all, though you occasionally see some film artifacts (like a blob just before Rosalind Russell falls into a container at the department store).  Also, there is no commentary, and the documentary isn't about the movie itself.
0767836324|5.0|What if Peter Pan really did grow up? I beleive Mr. Speilburg got it right with this one. His capability is transmogrifying book to film is masterful. Although there are a few minute mistakes, such as Hook's hook suppossedly on the right rather than the left, this film invokes the soul of J.M. Barrie's magical story. <BR>     <BR>Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam) is a perfect choice for Peter Pan, now grown up and known as Peter Banning. Peter, whose past as a free-sprited and ageless Pan, has long forgotten Neverland. Instead his life is about stocks, cell-phones, and an ironic fear of heights. He comes home one night to find that both of his children, Jack and Maggie, have been kidnapped by none other than Captain Hook himself. Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith; Harry Potter I-II)tries hard to explain to him that only he can save his children, for he is really the great Peter Pan.<br />Dustin Hoffman's (Tootsie) portrayal as Captain James Hooks is remarkable. He emobodies the charecter with wonderful acting skill, right down to Hook's grace, manners, and a distorted belief of \\"good form\\". All of his pirate crew, including the lovable Mr. Smee (Bob Hoskins; Who Framed Roger Rabbit)put on a wonderful show.<br />I hope you enjoy following along with Peter makes as he makes his final trip to Neverland. And with the aid of Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts; Erin Brockavitch) and the Lost Boys, he must remember how to fight, how to crow, and most importantly how to fly, in order to save his own two children from the cunning and evil grasps of Capt. Jas. Hook.
B00004R7TP|4.0|Kate Bush is a dear to me.  Such a child-like figure with her playful voice and her flair for theatrics.  (Although her subject matter can be dark or sexual, not exactly suitable for children's ears).  Every album I have of hers has made me fall in love with her style.  Even though this isn't my favorite album of hers musically, it nevertheless has the Kate Bush charm I've come to expect.  For some strange reason I had a hard time getting into this, partly because I had just come off \\"The Dreaming\\" experience and found \\"The Hounds of Love\\" to be less invigorating.  Now, after 4 listens I've come to respect this album and I place it 4th on my Kate Bush list; after \\"The Dreaming\\",\\"Lionheart\\", and \\"The Red Shoes\\".
B000099T2L|4.0|As we say in the South, &quot;Girl you done good!&quot; I can't claim to like every song on the CD, but I appreciate and admire the obvious talent. &quot;Baby Boy&quot; is a current favorite. It's gets my hips moving in a way that my husband loves to see. I was thrown by this version of &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;. The live performance of this song is much, much better and the previous version on the Destiny Child CD was perfect as it was.
B00009V7RF|4.0|I know, I agree, they have a whole range of sounds, but I don't think it's too much. I've been waiting forever for a cd like this to come out...and finally, it's here! I don't know how males (I may have a female bias?- it's different from other BEP) would feel about this cd, but it's definetly a good one in my eyes.<br />1. Hands Up-  7/10 Not a bad song, it can either grow on you, or get really irritating. For the most part it's a good song, I just really don't like when they say \\"handsUP!\\"<br />2. Labor Day (It's A Holiday)- 8/10 Well, I've never heard of a song for Labor Day...good song though. The hook is different, but once again, a song that grows on you.<br /><br />3. Let's Get Retarded-  10/10 Despite the stupid lyrics \\"let's get retarded in here..Get stupid\\" ..I mean, come on! Not to mention somewhat offensive, really if you take everything seriously. But if you can get past the stupid lyrics here, this is a great song with tight beats.<br />4. Hey Mama-  10/10 Another great song with great reggae beats- may remind you a bit of Sean Paul, but this beats anything that Sean Paul could ever come up with.<br />5. Shut Up- 100/10!! Lol. Seriously though, this song is enough of a reason to buy the cd. This has to be my favourite song...really good song.  It's a different kind of beat though, check out the preview to see if you like it. If you don't, there's surely something wrong with you :-p<br /><br />6. Smells Like Funk- 9/10 anither good song that makes you wanna get on up<br /><br />7. Latin Girls - 9/10 Another good song. It doesn't really get me, the way some of the other songs do, but it's all in all a good song.<br /><br />8. Sexy- 10/10 A jazz edge with a bit of...a latin beat?  Yes, this song is DEFINETLY sexy....Makes you want to salsa or tango...<br /><br />9. Fly Away-  9/10 Mainly female vocals in this song. Perfect song for when you driving down the highway and the winds flowing through your hair.<br /><br />10. The Boogie That Be-  9/10 Love the sounds of this song. Another stupid title (boogie?? I dunno, maybe it's some cool new street slang..haha..)The singer in the song sounds a bit old school, so if that's your thing, then this is your song. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong. \\"When I hear music, I get into it...\\" The new female sings here, and she definetly adds some more flavour to song, if not the whole CD.<br /><br />11. The Apl Song- 8/10 This is a slower jam, and I really like the lyrics for this song. THe only reason this is 8/10 is because I'm not big on slower songs, but this isn't bad, it has a mid-tempo r&b feel to it.<br /><br />12. Anxiety-  11/10 a REALLY good song that features Papa Roach. Yeah, you heard me.  I don't know how much it fits into the cd considering it's got rock vibes, but it's a hella good song if you like Papa Roach or Linkin Park. \\"Please please please, take away my anxiety...\\"<br /><br />13. Where Is The Love-  7/10 First single off the album, you've probably heard it already. An alright song, but my least favourite on the album. Very good lyrics though, but it's not my type of song.<br />If you like beats like this , check out BEP \\"Bridging the Gap\\"- you can't go wrong with songs like \\"hot\\" and \\"weekends,\\" some  N.e.r.d, Beyonce Knowles, Monica, City High, Mya (MoodRing, tight, tight CD), More Save The Last Dance (soundtrack), Swollen Members (\\"Breathe\\" featuring Nelly Furtado)....etc.etc.ve the sounds of this song.

B000099T2L|4.0|Like the other reviewers...this cd is better than I thought it would be. The more I listen to it the more I like. Beyonce demonstrates her ability and versatility in this cd. Although this cd consists mostly of ballads, it's definetely not one of those cd's you play and every song sounds the same. My least favorite song is &quot;That's how you like it&quot; w/ Jay-z. Overall... I give it two thumbs up!

B000002LLC|1.0|All I can say about Madonna's \\"I'm Breathless\\" album is YIKES! This CD scares and sickens me. I am a Madonna fan, I like all her stuff, except this stuff. She is known for constantly reinventing herself but this album was one make-over gone terribly wrong. The songs are very 1940's, Big-Band-Broadway style but with a very 1991 beat tacked on to them. Quite frightening.<BR>I think the biggest mistake with this album is that it was inspired by the Dick Tracy Movie. Now anyone who ever saw that movie knows how bad it is, that alone would suggest that an album inspired by it can't be very good. And on the album Madonna sounds very goofy. She's singing in a character voice, which basically sounds like she's holding her nose and belting out a few notes. Not good.<BR>The songs are are all exactly the same except for two of them -- \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" which makes me want to vomit. It's a salsa-style song that lasts about 2 minutes with lyrics like \\"I'm going bananas and I feel like my poor little heart is being devoured by paranas 'cause I'm going bananas.\\" Those are some pretty genius lyrics there (just kidding). Then there's \\"Vogue,\\" which is the only good song to come out of \\"I'm Breathless.\\" It really doesn't fit in the album. \\"Vogue\\" is a good song tacked onto a bad CD. If you just want that song, buy the single, don't purchase this whole CD just for that song. You'll regret it.<BR>If you're a die-hard Madonna fan, buy this CD used or rent it front the library and burn it on your computer. Don't buy it new, please don't buy it new. For your sake, don't buy it new. Madonna, I love you, I love your stuff, but this CD [stinks].
0800141660|4.0|Jane Austen fans won't be disappointed by the movie version of one of her best books. Really quite delightful.
6305263248|5.0|Okay High Def owners. Okay, Super Surround Owners. Bored? Not enough eye candy? Not dodging your speaker's sounds? Get Ronin. Bobby Deniro and Jean Reno[The Professional] are enough reasons to get this thriller. But the car chase scene filmed with Frankenheimer's briliance is off the charts fantastic. This, to me is why DVD should exist. Brilliant sound. Brilliant video. If you don't dodge and weave inside the car while they're barreling down the streets of Nice, France like bats out of hell then I quit. If you have a progressisve scan DVD and a digital video source I promise you'll be pleased. The 5.1 digital sound dosen't disappoint either. It even includes an offbeat love story for that significant other who would otherwise be playing with your ears or something instead of watching the blood and guts. As you can see I highly recommend this DVD.
0385507755|2.0|Well, the first half of the book held my interest, but this story had such a fatal drop after that, ugh, total boredom.  I couldn't even finish the book. The colorful description of having a root canal \\"sans novocaine\\" was pretty interesting and that's about it.  I feel the drug use must have affected the authors sense of recall and storytelling........ Was expecting something more based on the reviews and hype I had been reading in the media about this book (as were all the other reviewers here, it seems). If you can get your hands on \\"Twisted: Inside The Mind of a Drug Addict\\" by Carl Adam Richmond, it's a much better read.
B00005JLT5|5.0|'The Pianist' is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman. I saw the DVD version after I had seen the movie in theaters 4 times, and after reading the book twice. The book was written immediately after the war, and it has a lot of detail that is unique. It is one man's perspective, and his lack of bitterness is remarkable. Roman Polanski has retained the honesty and the detached observation of Szpilman while making the movie. As far as the movie was concerned, the DVD did not add to what I had already experienced.  For me, the movie made a deep emotional impact, and the book is very inspiring. I liked 'The Pianist' even more than Schindler's list.  It goes straight to the heart, possibly because of the truth and the directness in it.  <br />Adrien Brody- as Szpilman- is brilliant, and fully deserving of his Oscar. He is in nearly every scene, and he expresses so much without any words! Polanski and screenplay writer Ron Harwood have stayed very close to the book, at times including an entire scene, with dialogues and details from the book. <br />The DVD has, on the other side, interviews with Polanski, Brody, Harwood, and Thomas Kreschman (he played the German officer in the movie). It shows what went into the making of this great film. The German archives have footage of the Jews being taken to the train, etc. They were used in creating some of the scenes. Some things came from Polanski's childhood experiences- the Jewish police says to Szpilman, after saving his life, \\"Don't run!\\"- it came from Polanski's own experience. What kept Szpilman alive after he lost his entire family was his love for music. The DVD has a clip of the real Szpilman playing Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor- the music he played before and after the bombing of the radio station. If only he had lived to see this movie!<br /> I would highly recommend the movie 'The Pianist', and particularly the DVD version for the extra material that comes with it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I'm a 45 year old mother of a teenaged boy who finally asked him who sang that song that I hear as I'm tuning over to my classic rock radio station.  I bought the CD and was pulled in by the bass line and the clear, hammering drums.  I'm hooked on this CD.  In a strange way, it reminds me of many of the bands that I loved back in the 70's and 80's and fits right into my hard rock library.  You've got to try it.  But, my advice is to try it loud.
B00005JMK6|5.0|I went into this film sceptical because I lived in Barcelona on two occassions, once for a year as a student at the University of Barcelona living in a building for Erasmus exhange students.  The subject of this movie was too close to my personal experiences.  I honestly thought that I would walk out disappointed (like I have from nearly every other film about Barcelona.)<br />But this movie suprised me!  No other movie has ever been more accurate in the portrayal of the study abroad experience.  Not only that, but the movie gives an accurate portrayal of life in Barcelona and the troubles that foreign students experience there.  The linguistic difficulties were realistic, the scenes of Barcelona showed not just the beautiful, touristy parts, but also the scummier parts.<br />Even if you've never studied abroad or been to Barcelona, the movie is just histerical.  I laughed so hard.  But at the same time, there was so much conflict between characters and within the main character, making the film both touching and profound.<br />The final few minutes are what totally sold me on the film.  The resolution took the film to a higher level, one that really makes you take a second look at everything.  I LOVED this movie!!  I can't wait till it is released on DVD.  I'm going to buy it right away!!
B000003N7R|5.0|Duke Ellington made his name known leading the longest-running big-band in the history of jazz as well as being known as a great pianist and one of jazz's greatest and most important composers.  John Coltrane is known a generation later for his legendary innovations as a saxophone player and as a jazz composer as well.  Although A Love Supreme hadn't been recorded at this time, Giant Steps had, and it made a significant impact.  So, these two legends coming together for an album of great music is so awesome, you could buy the album because of the names alone.  And they certainly live up to their names on this album.<br />It begins with a well-known Ellington composition &quot;In a Sentimental Mood&quot;; this is my favorite performance of this song, with a soothing, delicate groove and featuring an equally delicate treatment of the melody by Coltrane.  Duke's beautiful solo also contributes to the atmosphere before Trane picks it back up to finish it off.<br />&quot;Take the Coltrane&quot; speeds things up after the opening ballad, and Coltrane plays his first solo here, and it is an awesome one.  Bassist Jimmy Garrison (who plays in Coltrane's classic quartet along with an amazing drummer on this album named Elvin Jones) also gives a great solo.<br />Another standout here is the two playing Billy Strayhorn's &quot;My Little Brown Book&quot;, an intense and passionate melody, and it is treated superbly by Duke and Trane.<br />Overall, I recommend this album to any jazz fan because two of the greatest and most influencial names in jazz play here.  But also because these guys live up to their names and reputations by playing ballads gorgeously and faster songs with an awesome sense of swing.  Check it out; you won't be disappointed.
1573301183|4.0|The music is amazing!  The sound and video are excellent!  But it is not a great performance.  Layne Staley hardly moved on his stool while singing.  So, if you're not an absolute fan of the band, then you might regret buying it.
B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane had been on the map for a while as a sideman to guys like Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, and Blue Train was rather popular, but it was not until this album that Coltrane really did something new on his own.  Giant Steps is important because it is Coltrane's first album with only his compositions, and it broke through to the jazz audience, showing his gift both as a musician and jazz visionary.<br />The album kicks off with the fast &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, a song which is revolutionary in its rapid chord changes but no home key.  The melody is very catchy, and it is played twice.  Then Coltrane solos, and you know then that the album is going to be great.<br />Coltrane keeps your interest with the bluesy &quot;Cousin Mary&quot;, the REALLY intense &quot;Countdown&quot;, the playful &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot;, but for me, the peak of this album is &quot;Naima&quot; (Naima is Trane's wife). This is my favorite track on the album.  The melody is gorgeous, and Wynton Kelly's only solo is an excellent one (Flanagan plays on all the other original tracks).  Coltrane finishes off this superb album with &quot;Mr P.C.&quot; (P.C. = Paul Chambers, the bassist), which is a fast blues in C Minor that really gets the improvisers playing some remarkable solos.  Then the album is over, and I knew that I still had much to get out of it.<br />I recommend this album for anyone interested in buying it.  It is not only essential for jazz fans; it's a great starting point to get into jazz.  The melodies are very catchy and Coltrane's solos are very accessible.  Look into it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|this has to be one of my favorite movies!! i loved the first one and the second one in my opinion was even better. i have read all of the books and i did see that TTT had some scenes that were not included in the book. ok maybe not just SOME. but TTT was still a great movie!! it ended in a cliffhanger which i personally didn't like cause the book ended a little further... well, i'm just waiting for this DVD to come out so that i can watch it 100x!!!<BR>*** i personally also think that orlando bloom is very handsome. ^-^ he played the best looking elf that i've ever seen in my entire life! go orlando!! he looks really good even without that blond wig.***
630542845X|5.0|This DVD is in a small DVD case where I keep my favorites. Whoever was the casting director should have received awards. On top of having Mary Steambergen, Jeff Goldbloom and Lance Henrickson who are all great, Sean Patrick Flanery (Powder) and Bradford Tatum (the school bully) play amazing characters.<br />  It's been said that this is a sad movie. This is a \\"glass half empty\\" way of looking at it. I felt that it showed (in multiple occasions) that in death, there is something else out there. There's no real end to life. Anyone who cried in this movie was happy when they cried.<br />  I hope this review helps to open the eyes of anyone who has not heard of this film or wasn't sure what to expect. Enjoy.
B00008LDPU|4.0|i was sorta exspecting for it to be a little better but it was overall very well done. there are 9 short films in the DVD and all of them are animated either using comp. graphics or animation. the one thing that i didn't really like about each short film is that almost all of them except one had a tragic ending. but i did like most of them. the cool part is that one of the films &quot;the final flight of the osiris&quot; was made by square. you know, the same people that make the final fantasy games. :)
0345413377|5.0|I was unsure if I could capture the magnificence of this book in a review, but when I saw how so many have needlessly attacked it, I thought I should compensate. Seriously, my friends, if a mere (but yet in numerous ways, phenomenal) fantasy novel could tarnish the standpoints of one with confidence whatever their religion, then this person surly would have lost faith long ago, or was bound to.  Even children know when to separate fantasy from reality, and that is why the harsh criticism of the Harry Potter series is also ludicrous.  It is most obvious in the many worlds with kingdoms of speaking armored bears, bands flying of witches who travel from parallel universe-to-universe, inner daemons that we can see if we try, and amazing and unlikely adventure that this is a genuine fantasy story. <br />     One can not overlook the beautiful side of humanity that Pullman has also emphasizes- such as pure, innocent and honest love, goodness that we all can share that is unlimited by a higher power, that no matter how twisted and cruel a person may have been in the past- that person may change his outlook on the world because of natural inner-goodness that will always shine through, and that in some way, we are all connected through our thoughts and legacies.  If any message is received by kids who have read this series, it is that no matter what shocking truths that have yet to be discovered, what evil there is in an all to close universe or even in our own lives, whatever conflicts we may face- we are still humans, and we possess the most powerful emotions and drives that make life worth living. This book was my favorite in the series because it presents a comforting meaning for life in whimsical way. You may be entitled to your opinions, but you're definitely missing out on a quality experience.
0800130928|3.0|De Niro joins NY's taxi squad, and becomes immersed in the city's scum, the hookers, the pimps, the porn, everything that is humanity's worse.<br />This constant experience with the seedy side of NYC, causes De Niro to fall into a state of enough is enough. The city has taken his soul and his life. Through this he becomes suicidal, and is compelled to do something about it.<br />No doubt, this film is a very good character portrayal of a man falling, and De Niro does a first rate job. For it's genre, it's probably one of the best. BUT where's the entertainment in this film? Watching it, it was a journey of De Niro's character, but I was waiting for some plot to show up. Even with the deadly ending, it wasn't enough to justify the 2 hours of watching this movie.<br />I'd say, good acting by De Niro, it's a sombre and depressing look  at a man swallowed up in NYC's worse, but don't expect to be entertained by this movie. It is what it is.
1586210912|5.0|Less than a year ago I was reading an article in Money Magazine. It was about a couple that was on their way to being millionaires. I remember the author saying that the couple had read this book by Robert Kiyosaki and \\"it changed their life.\\" For some reason it struck me as funny and I decided, \\" `changed their life' I guess it's worth a read.\\" So I read it and it changed my life. Both my wife and I have redirected our investments and the way we manage them. For the last 20 years I have diligently read books, general periodicals (Newsweek, Time, etc), Money magazine and the business section of the local paper to be a responsible head of household and steward of our money. This book brought clarity to my understanding of money. I realized that 90-95% of the materials I have read were essentially garbage. <BR>Now I have bought this book for all my family and recommend it to all my friends.<BR>One catch, RK writes his books as teasers to his other books (he knows how to make money). I have read many of them. This first one kills any previous misinformation you may have about money (probably the 90-95% stuff you think you know). The next two books (Cash Flow Quadrants and What the Rich Invest In) are more foundation and reinforcement. The rest are topic specific.
B000002V0Q|5.0|In 1992, my life changed forever.  I was only 7 when I was introduced to this album, and I can honestly say it changed my perspective of music forever.  The tracks on this album steered me into the world of music, and eventually, it shaped me into a musician.<br />A few comments on the album itself: it's not as speedy as the previous albums, but make no mistake, it is every bit as aggressive.  Don't be tricked into listening to people say this is Megadeth's musical falling point... at any given point with Mustaine, Ellefson, Menza, and Friedman, Megadeth was never falling.  That lineup, I think, was the strongest, tightest, and heaviest.<br />You will need to hear the album for yourself to experience the rush... some highlights off this album are Skin O' My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction (AWESOME guitar solo), Sweating Bullets, Countdown to Extinction, High Speed Dirt, and Ashes in Your Mouth; although I must admit, there isn't a single bad song on this album.
B00005LQ04|2.0|I started this movie in the hope that it would be one of the scariest I have ever seen. I was sadly disapointed! The first kill seen was good but then the middle of the movie was slow and boring. It had a \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" feel to it. This would not even rank in the top 20 of scary movies I have seen. If you are looking for a scary movie don't choose this one. If you are looking for a ok movie with a good story this might be what you are looking for. I think the problem was I did a lot of reading on this movie and got caught up in all the hype of the movie.
B00006HBUC|1.0|I just want to forget this movie forever, and continue to apreciate the cartoon itself, 'cause this adaptation is a tottaly disgrace!! It ruins with the name of Scooby-doo, so, don't watch it! Instead, watch Zombie Island, THAT'S A REALLY SCOOBY DOO STORY!!
B000099T2L|1.0|What a let down!  Beyonce has everything needed to be a huge star except songs.  This CD, with the exception of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, is boring and uninspired.  I was expecting a lot but she just re-hashes the old Destiny Child formula so it sounds like a collection of outtakes from the horrible &quot;Survivor&quot; CD.<BR>Most of the songs are either over wrought ballads or hip hop dance tunes that never catch and just sputter out after about 3 minutes.  <BR>She also makes the &quot;Mariah Mistake&quot; of inviting every rapper from the 'hood to &quot;guest&quot; and then watching them overtake the song and rob it of any flow or melody.
B00006879E|5.0|This is an amazing album to say the least. I went to their concert on April 5th and WHoa.... THey are great live. I swear if you buy this album you won't regret it. These songs are very soulful..but at the same time very rockable...My favorite (if i have to pick one)song on this cd is probably shiver..and harder to brethe and well i love them all...i got this cd about three months ago and i just have kept listening to it over and over again..And i am really looking forward to going to see them with john mayer and the counting crows this summer.... Oh and if you get the chance to see them live.. GO! Even if you have never heard their music before you will become an instant fan! They are really good on stage...very...charasmatic...(i hope i spelled that right). BUY THIS CD NOW...!
B00004XMS0|4.0|I bought the dvd of the original Batman movie giving up hope that a better dvd would come out. Hell this one doesn't even have a trailer. Could use a commentary track by Tim Burton as well. Anyway doesn't look a special edition is being released anytime soon, god knows it deserves one.<br />  Now to the movies. Tim Burton directed Batman and Batman Returns and critics found the film too dark. Well Joel Schmacher who took over after Burton the series got the wrong idea thinking that critics meant the series needed to be colorful. ...<br />  Well anyway Burton's versions were moody and violent but...I liked the series a hell of a lot more that way. People complained that the Penguin shouldn't have really been a half penguin half man and that Cat women shouldn't have actually had 9 lives. Well that's silly I agree but a lot more clever than anything Joel brought to the series. Riddler and Two Face were like the villains of the old 60's Batman tv show, they just laugh non-stop with a bunch of dumb lines. Scary enough Batman & Robin was even more like the 60's tv show. George Clooney might have been a good Batman if he was working with Tim Burton and not a silly script full of terrible on-liners. Uma Thurman makes a good Poison Ivy but she has nothing but bad lines to say as well. No ones lines are as bad as Arnold's though as Mr. Freeze. Instead of  being called Mr. Freeze his name should have been Nursery Rhyme Man. He was a really bad choice as well for the part. I also though Christopher Lloyd should have played Mr. Freeze. Also if Robin being around wasn't bad enough Alicia Silverstone arrives as Barbara Alfred's grandaughter  or something dumb like that. Funny I  thought she was related Commisioner Gordon in the comics ?<br />  Anyway the first one is the best. Some people say it should have been called the Joker since he has more screen time than Batman. I think that's silly as Batman still gets to shine and still has a lot of cool scenes. It's Batman Returns which the villain the Penguin has a lot more to do than Batman himself. Even if the villains have too much screen time in Burton's versions at least he took them seriously. I would have loved to see the series continued with him helming them. I still wonder how cool he could have made a character like the Scare Crow. Burton also had the right idea having Batman alone. Most Batman fans like myself don't even like Robin lol.<br />  I'd rate the first Batman ****. It's a dark but highly entertaining. Michael Keaton may have been too short for the part but still managed to give us the best Batman of all of them. Plus was easier to take him seriously without  a whole bunch of corny lines. Jack Nicholson is awesome as the Joker, he has a lot of one liners but wow what do know they worked. He was a bit over the top but he was scary as well as being actually  funny as well. I'd give Batman Returns *** for the performances and the direction. I'd give Batman Forever *** for the cast and how it is sorta fun even if it is nothing compard to the first 2. I'd give Batman & Robin * 1/2. George Clooney makes a good Bruce Wayne but as Batman he didn't get much of a chance to prove himself. With better material maybe he could have worked as Batman. Uma Thurman like I said is good as well. Everything else...is just bad. The set design for Gotham City like in Batman Forever is way too colorful. Joel Schmacher shows more with this one than with Forever why he shouldn't have replaced Burton. Anyway only the first 2 are actually worth owning. Only wish they'd release better dvds for them.h the villain the Penguin has a lot more to do than Batman himself.

B00008NG5V|5.0|Brushfire Fairytales was great but On and On is better.  The music is just so easy to listen to and relaxing.  People get on Jack for his music not being very exciting or original but i think it is just the opposite.  He speaks his mind about everything and the flow of his music is just incredible.  Its the music that i groove to and find peace of mind in.
B000002B1M|4.0|This is a great follow up album from Nas. This is Nas at his greatest, in the mid 90's. This isn't as great as the classic no doubt ''Illmatic'' but its a great album. The 1st song The Message is a great song and I gave you power, which is a tale about how people use a gun. No doubt this is simply history as time goes on. Don't get me wrong there are some other great songs like Affrimative Action with young Foxy Brown, Cormega, and AZ. Lauren Hill puts it down on if I ruled the world. No doubt this is on of Nas's best albums as a street story teller.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is one of the first I did not feel taken for paying 14 bucks for.  The whole cd is good and there is not one song on this cd that I have not already listened to 100 times.  I listened to this cd for 2 weeks straight in my car during my hour drive to work and I am listening to it again.  The lead singers voice is mesmerizing and the beats stay with you.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas's ''Illmatic'', is a hands down classic from the beginning to end it shows how good Nas was before he is even at the age to drink alcohol. At 20 years old Nas puts down 10 tracks which is rare for a rap album because of these 20 something track rap albums. This will make you want more from Nas. HE is a great street story tella. If you see this in a store BUY IT!!! Because in a while this album will go out of print and it will just be a classic historic artifact. I don't need to say ne thing about the songs cuz they are all 10/10, the songs are equally as good as the other one. This is one of the best hip hop albums put together. Also buy Nas's second release ''It Was Written'', because that is a good album too.
6300247376|5.0|Another reviewer has averred that this is the best of Bronson &amp; Marvin's careers; I'm not sure I agree, but it's certainly on the short list. I'd begin by noting the factual basis - and the working-class focus. Many of the characters in the movie are obviously machismo-deluded jerks who have fled civilization to find an environment that won't expose their incompetence - this remark does NOT include the characters played by Bronson and Marvin. That said, I'll admit the direction is rough - but the story is rough, and the way it is told is not implausible. The continuity favors a distance of view that makes the story's factual basis more apparent. More than one reviewer has made plain the fact that he or she missed the respect and sympathy that Marvin's character feels for the man he is pursuing. See the movie - see if you don't agree with him.
B00005A46T|3.0|...i must say if your looking for a good slipknot cd buy their self titled album slipknot. it is so much better. Iowa just doesnt have any i don;t know what top call it. borrow it from a friend or download it first. it just doesnt compare to slipknot. many of my friends agree. hope this review helped. just look into it before you buy it and so you dont go wasting your money

B00005JLWN|4.0|This movie was a pretty good flick. It had imagination, a great score, a working plot, but the stroy line wasn't all that original. It looked like a mix between 'The Giver' and 'Fahrenhiet 451'. It also took a little while to get to the action. It was also strange to see Christian Bale to play such a good guy. But, yeah, it was good.

0375414932|5.0|William Boyd is the true inheritor of Evelyn Waugh, and stands as the finest English writer alive today.  (He doesn't get nearly as much attention as the likes of Martin Amis and others because he seems not to like the public eye.)  This is another wonderful book, in the style of the New Confessions.  While not quite as innovative as some of his other work (Brazzaville Beach, for instance), it is nonetheless an affecting book, which stays with the reader long after it has been put down.  I will look forward to rereading it before not too long, and as always will eagerly await his next offering.
B00005RYLE|5.0|The story of this extremely brutal film involves five college students named Ash (Bruce Campbell), Scotty (Hal Delrich), Shelly (Sarah York), Linda (Betsy Baker), and Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), going up to a rented cabin in the woods for a vacation. Soon, after getting settled, they check out the basement, where Ash and Scotty find a mystical dagger, the \\"Necronomicon ex Mortis\\", or book of the dead, and a tape recorder. The recorder is played, with a professor rattling off a incantation that brings an evil spirit to life that possesses Cheryl and destroys the only bridge out of there. As his friends fall victim one by one to the spirit, Ash must find a way to stop the evil once and for all.<br />A horror movie made on a shoestring budget, most people would label this as garbage, but it's not. It's ENTERTAINING garbage. The performances, especially by Bruce Campbell, are excellent. The gore effects are really stomach-churning: hands being bitten off, melting, stabbings, decomposing, and a decapatation are among them. The video and audio quality are incredible for a movie this old. The extras are packed, inclusding the packaging, which a recreation of the book prop in the movie. The trailer, TV spots, and still gallery are there, with the documentaries DISCOVERING EVIL DEAD, on introducing Europe to Evil Dead, and FANALYSIS, on Bruce Campbell's reaction to fans, being well done. The commentary track is very informative, and the behind the scenes footage is excellent, seeing the cast try those creepy voices without the sound modulator, and the cast acting silly between takes. A collectible and informative booklet is there too. all in all, the so far ULTIMATE edition of thiss cool film.<br />THE EVIL DEAD<BR>(1982, R)<BR>Ash: Bruce Campbell<BR>Cheryl: Ellen Sandweiss<BR>Scotty: Hal Delrich<BR>Linda: Betsy Baker<BR>Shelly: Sarah York<BR>Voice on Recorder: Bob Dorian<br />Director: Sam Raimi<BR>Writer: Sam Raimi<br />MOVIE: 5<BR>VIDEO: 5<BR>AUDIO: 5<BR>EXTRAS: 5<BR>MENUS:5<BR>OVERALL: 5
1400034779|5.0|I bought this book because of a review I read in a magazine...can't remember which one.<br /> Now, I have all the books in Alexander McCall's Smith's series about Precious Ramotswe, proud owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana.<br />Unlike some reviews here, I can find no fault with the books.  I agree they are not complex who-done-it thrillers, but Precious Ramotswe does not lead a thrilling life.  She lives at a slower pace, more in tune with nature and her intuition than those of us in western civilization.  The mysteries she solves are not that difficult, but she takes great pride in her professionalism and treats each client with great care and compassion.<br />I particularly like the way I feel when I read about the daily happenings in Mma Ramotswe's life.  I like reading about her house on Zebra Drive; her bright secretary (who scored 97% at the Botswana Secretarial College); her companion Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni; her life growing up as the beloved daughter of a devoted father who left his life's work to her so she could open her own business; her disastrous marriage; and the variety of people who seek out her professional assistance.<br />Some reviewers have compared Mma Ramotswe to Miss Marple.  I guess the comparison fits, but it seems to me that Mma Ramotswe would prefer to belong in a category by herself....the first female private investigator in Botswana.<br />If you like the Jan Karon series about Father Tim and his beloved village of Mitford, then you might want to give The No 1. Ladies' Detective Series a try.<br />Enjoy!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a movie.<BR>You try making an interesting script out of that book the way it's structured.<br />For anyone who understands movies and script writing and what needs to happen for a story to be conveyed, this script and this movie are absolutely AMAZING accomplishments.<br />For Tolkien nerds who care more about strict adherence as if the Two Towers were the written word of GOD, I suggest you try to understand what Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, William Friedkin and others have had to understand:   <br />That an amazing book needs to be ADAPTED before it can make an amazing movie and this is an amazing movie.<br />But enough fighting off the losers who can't get over the fact that movies and books are different by definition.<br />Smeagol alone is enough to make this the greatest movie of 2002.  <br />I'm not sure when I've EVER seen a character so perfectly developed and executed... let alone one that isn't really there... or at least only sort of there.<br />rent it, but it, own it see it again and again.<br />Movies simply don't get better.
1400031354|5.0|Precious Ramotswe is quickly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters.  For the uninitiated, Mma Ramotswe is the first female private detective in Botswana.  But, to say she's only a private detective is like saying that Father Tim (from the At Home in Mitford series) is just a village preacher.<br />I don't mind that most of the mysteries Mma Ramotswe solves are pretty transparent and not very dangerous.  What I love about these stories is the way the author weaves a spell about simple people, living gracious lives, while being kind (for the most part) to one another.<br />At the end of a Mma Ramotswe book, I'm left with a feeling of peace.<br />This is sweet, gentle fiction...set in Africa, but it's universally appealing.<br />I wonder who's going to star in the movie?  Whoopi Goldberg comes to mind...or Alfrie Woodard....or Angela Bassett...strong, independent women all....like Precious Ramotswe herself.<br />Enjoy!
B000068OSK|5.0|I own all four White Stripes albums, and their debut is by far the BEST album so far..   Jack and Meg definitely overdid themselves on this album of 'organized noise'. Meg is an amazing timekeeper with her minimalist drumming. Jack has his distinctive voice (which my dad thinks sounds strangled) and his incredibly incredible blues-ish guitar.

Insightful and clever, using today's technology (computers) and an instinct for the nature of the game and what makes some marginal players a better bet than some superstars - its all here. You might not agree, but you will definitely have plenty to think about, and that's what a good book should do.
B000002X4T|5.0|This may be the peak album for Jefferson Airplane, because guest Nicky Hopkins' piano raises it to a higher musical level.  (Nicky performed as a Rolling Stone on Beggars' Banquet with similar effect.)  The best songs of Volunteers are Grace Slick's \\"Hey Frederick\\" and \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\", the Crosby-Stills penned \\"Wooden Ships\\", and Jorma Kaukonen's \\"Good Shepherd\\" and \\"Turn My Life Down\\".  The piano and lead guitar intro to \\"Frederick\\" is like an urgent wake up call.  Then Grace sings \\"Either go away or go ALL the way in.\\"  Yes, it's about sex, but using Popular Mechanics imagery, some of it violent, as in \\"gear stripping the willow\\".  \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\", also by Grace, is a pastiche of nature images on a global scale, with the underlying message that the earth cares little for man.  These two songs are Grace's compositional and vocal showpieces on the album, and she does her usual masterful job.  \\"Wooden Ships\\" is more passionate than the CSN version, but without CSN's appealing syncopation on the line \\"very free\\".  Paul Kantner, Marty Balin and Grace all sing on this one, and Jorma's lead guitar is searing.  Overall it's excellent, neither better nor worse than the original.  Jorma, whose guitar is sonically the most striking aspect of the album, turns out two gentle songs, an arrangement of the traditional \\"Good Shepherd\\" (but still with a sharp-edged solo), and his sweet, original \\"Turn My Life Down\\", with Marty singing a strong lead in the albums best male vocal performance.  Jorma seems to be the most optimistic, least inner-conflicted of the band's four songwriters.  \\"Meadowlands\\", Grace's organ solo version of an old Russian military song, is kind of a throwaway number, but it is beautiful none the less.  \\"The Farm\\" is amusing and insignificant.  \\"Song for All Seasons\\" is a dopey spoof of country-western, but hey, the drummer Spencer Dryden wrote it, and we usually don't hear from him.<br />That brings us to the bookends of the album, \\"We Should Be Together\\"and \\"Volunteers\\".  Both are fine musically, but these are political songs.  \\"Volunteers\\", with words by Marty (generally the Airplane/Starship's love-ballad singer), is clearly tongue-in-cheek (\\"One generation got old - one generation got soul!\\").  \\"Together\\", on the other hand, by Paul Kantner, goes beyond the Airplane's characteristic and appealing irreverence and genuine embodiment of cultural upheaval.  Paul seems quite the earnest preacher here, especially when taken in the context of his continuing obsession with generational communalist revolt in his subsequent work with Jefferson Starship.  Paul made wonderful musical contributions to the Airplane, but from this point forward his naive leftist mission overshadowed his increasingly uninteresting music.  No protestations of innocence by him today can change the unfortunate fact that his battle cry met with some success in being taken seriously and with approval by his listeners, as he no doubt intended.  Here are some examples from this song: \\"We are all outlaws in the eyes of America.\\" / \\"All your private property is target for your enemy, and your enemy is we.\\" / \\"Everything they say we are, we are.\\" / \\"Up against the wall mother------\\".  As propaganda goes, this is pretty crude, but Paul Kantner was in ample company, of writers more than musicians, in hitching the hippies' self-regarding generational tribalism to a message of pseudo-Marxism.  I'm not crediting Paul with originality in this capacity, but I hope he feels a twinge of shame as he enjoys his ample private property today.  To paraphrase his own words, everything he said he was, he was.  <br />But we're talking music here, and Volunteers is first-class music, perhaps the best ever by this unique and influential band.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is the best thing released by this band since Coda.  Zeppelin fans have been waiting a long time for something like this... now only if there were a reunion tour...
B00005JLYU|4.0|Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle is going to be one of those great unintentional parody movies and has cult movie potential.<br />Unlike \\"Loaded Weapon\\" or \\"Naked Gun\\", \\"Full Throttle\\" appears to be attempting serious action sequences and a real story line.  The fun part is that the action sequences are so completely over the top that you can't help but laugh and not take the film seriously.<br />This move ends up being pure camp.  I'm looking forward to seeing this one again just to take a closer look at the various references like:<br />- The scene where one of the bad-guys walks straight through/out of a fire just like in the Terminator movies.<br />- Magical jumping, flying, spinning, marital arts moves ala the Matrix.<br />- Spiderman style swinging through downtown Hollywood on a string of christmas lights.<br />The other fun element to this movie is the soundtrack and its music video-like application.<br />This movie is absolutely worth seeing.  It's a parody with very few truly serious moments.
B000000H7I|5.0|The ULTIMATE Death Metal Monument. No arguments. <BR>If you havent got it - BUY IT, if you don't like it - you don't appreciate fine music.
B000002HH2|2.0|I bought this CD simply because I spent my teenage years listening to the Sugarcubes, and I LOVED THE SUGARCUBES. I'm quite disappointed though cause this just doesn't sound like them. I mean sure the songs have Bjork's trademark singing voice, but the style of the music is rather boring. The only song I like on here is &quot;Army of Me&quot;. The rest is just filler to me. Sorry Bjork if I'm not digging your solo career.
B00009V7RF|1.0|If you were a fan of BEP's first album save yourself the disapontment of buying elephunk it's wack. They going from being one of the most creative underground groups in Hip Hop to doing songs with Justin Timberlake and Papa Roach??? If you want to buy a good new Hip Hop album by Gangstarr's new album The Ownerz or Krs-One Kristyles. Your money will be better spent. From one hip hop fan to another.
B00008PX8P|5.0|DEUTSCLANDHALLE<BR>Montag, den 19. Marz 1973<BR>O.E. Ltd presents:<BR>Led Zeppelin<br />- taken from my cherished framed ticket stub, memoralizing the \\"Greatest Live Concert\\" I have, or ever will witness! Having been to hundreds of events over the years, this wonderful document serves the point that Zep was amongst the best live performers! ANYONE who was within the first 25 rows, dead center, (as were 25-30 buzzed and rowdy GI's(big \\"hiya!\\" and long fogotten \\"daps to\\":Bigfoot, Brownie and Gabi, Frankie, Frenchie, Tahlier, Mike T, Goose, Moonie, and the rest of my homies!) at above show!!!), will offer absolute agreement. Watch how RP sings and plays to those before him... This DVD chronicles the magical and mystical aura of 'being there\\"!<br />Im not going to get into discussing all the technical aspects or the content; simply said, I think this work deserves an Oscar for documentary work. Feel free to search the web for sites that talk about how this work came about, and the painstaking details involved in resurrecting some of the footage. Simply put, the behind the scenes production is simply astounding; and my heartfelt gratitude to Jimmy Page and Company for their love and devotion in this project...<br />Anyways, having watched this collection several times over, many fond memories come forward. Playing on a top-o-the-line system, sends me back in time, \\"booggying bigtime with my p-zaps\\" stagefront-center. Ahhhhhh...<BR>Finally I will enjoy presenting this material to my children and grandchildren as testimony to \\"our musical days long past\\"! Now, I only can hope that other gems shall be brought forward from the vaults of the past: pictures and ticket stubs can only SHOW one was present, DVD events can immortalize WHAT it was...<br />Thanks JP!<BR>--------------------<BR>POW*MIA<BR>-you are not forgotten-
B000092ZYX|5.0|this album is incredible period. the only song i dont like is sit down stand up. this band never ceases to amaze me, excuse the cliche but its true. the real stand out material on the album is there there, myxamatosis, we suck young blood, actually i dont want to sit here and name every song so just do yourself a favor and buy every radiohead album and judge for yourself.<BR>1:30
B00008LDPU|5.0|This movie is created by anime masterminds from Japan. IF you are a long time anime fan then you should be familiar with such crisp visuals and outstanding artwork. For general viewers this piece will be a great piece to allow you a taste of true animation. Some episodes in here are packed with symbols and involve deep thinking to comprehend but its very pleasing. It's all eye candy and you won't be disappointed.
0743244249|3.0|DeLillo is such a great stylist, any one of his books are worth picking up. But this one, like the limo in the story, is a long white...driving the reader around to nowhere. It's so damn predictable I felt like I had already read it. Again, the prose is grand, but that Brutha Fez stuff shows a lot of seams. DeLillo seems so out of touch and...old. It's outright ridiculous in parts. There was so much potential here. He flexed his toes when he could have tap-danced. He'll never top Libra.
0064400018|5.0|While in her 60s Laura began to write about her childhood memories of the 1870s-80s. This first book was about her early life in the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Later, her second book was about her family's move to the virgin prairies. Like other Americans, then or now, her family moved to a seeming better life. But others stayed to live where their grandfather's grandfather resided. This book teaches the importance to children in obeying their parents, and what can happen if they don't. Her second book shows an improvement over her first.<br />This book presents a simple life that has disappeared beneath asphalt roads. Many Americans still raise their own crops, milk cows, feed and slaughter pigs, and hunt for food. But what has changed is the decreasing number of owner-operated small holders, and the increasing number of corporate agricultural factories. Few want to return to the olden days of constant manual labor, although the Amish continue to thrive on their lands.<br />I hope her books will continue to be read long after the fantasies of JK Rowlings are as forgotten as those of Horatio Alger, or those Wild West stories popular when Laura was alive.
B000000H6D|5.0|I love this album!!  I have no clue how they could have made it any better!!  If you like TON, you will love this experience!!  LONG LIVE TON!!!!!!!!!!
0385504209|1.0|I read this book after having read Lewis Perdue's _Daughter of God_ a couple of years ago, especially after the recent articles about Perdue's charge that _The DaVinci Code_ was based on his own. I was prepared to side with Brown, after all on the surface they share the common theme of early Christianity.<br />After finishing, I think my first impression may have been wrong.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I swear to all you people that this is the best musical, wait..this is the best movie I have ever seen! It's so awesome! The whole cast did such a wonderful job. I was really hoping that Renee Zellweger would get the Oscar. She was robbed, I absolutely HaTeD The Hours, it was such an odd movie. Im was overjoyed that Catherine Zeta Jones won though, she did the best out of all the cast! If you haven't seen this yet in theaters then try to find it somewhere because its a great movie going expierence. I really cant wait untill its out on DVD. I wish they would've left Class in it because I rEaLlY LoVe that song! Its hilarious! Anyways I suggest that you see it.
B00007BK2N|4.0|I was intrigued by the subject matter way before watching the film.  Being a huge fan of Joy Division, New Order and other Manchester bands, I knew it would be entertaining.<br />Steve Coogan is great as Tony Wilson.  He's funny without really trying to be.  <br />My only criticism is that more Manchester bands weren't profiled.  I know the film's focus is on Factory Records, but it would've been intersting to hear about The Charlatans, Stone Roses, Inspiral Carpets, etc.<br />If you're in the know when it comes to the 'Madchester' scene, this movie's for you.  Even if you're not familiar with the scene or genre, you won't be disappointed.
6300216039|5.0|This movie basically covers everything in the original play by william shakespeare.  it is very good if you're having trouble with the old english words.  but to get the full spectrum of the play (and an A on your essay) you should still read the play.
0345448898|5.0|These books are not only fantasy and adventure, but a learning experience as well.  They open your mind to new ideas and new feelings.  Will, Lyra, Pan, Mrs. Colter, Lord Aiseral and other characters are very animated.  The main characters (Will and Lyra) become great friends starting in the second book.  These books are good for mature readers who will understand and appreciate the book.  If you read this, you won't be able to stop, so make sure you have a lot of time on your hands.
B000099T2L|5.0|All I have to say is BEYONCE will surprise you. Go buy the Cd because it will leave you SPEECHLESS.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The two former members from At The Drive-In Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (guitar) and Cedric Bixler Zavala (vocals) who went on to form The Mars Volta now have their first Debut album De-Loused in the Comatorium, which is the best album of 2003, and quite possibly one of the greatest of all time.   The entire album was inspired by the life of Julio Venegas, and old friend to At The Drive-In who took his life while they were practising.  An original idea that not only blew my mind, but raised my expectations of all new music.  De-Loused in the Comatorium is just not something you would bring with you to a gathering people, but an album that takes over your self-consciousness for the full hour that it lasts, and an hour well spent I might add.  After listening to De-Loused I felt changed, and inspired by this absorption of convolutions I had just experienced, with its wide range of complexity.  I am taken back to track 7: Cicatriz Esp, where you, like I, may flash back to the feeling of Led Zeppelin, with the wailing of the guitars and excellent drumming, while on track 10 Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt, I am reminded of the former band of Cedric and Omar, At The Drive-In.  There was help from some of The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Flea and Jon provide help, without their talent this album still would have been great, but with their excellence it just added to the overall greatness The Mars Volta has shown me in this experience!  I strongly recommend your purchase of this album.
B000002O1Q|4.0|the fire inc. songs alone are a reson to buy this cd
B00008PX8P|5.0|Picture, if you will, the extra-human, godly ability to wave a magic wand, flash back in time, and fly back to 1969, 1970, 1973, 1975, and 1979. Then, imagine, IF you could, having the MONEY and ability to spend thousands of dollars or pounds, to take the jets overseas, buy hugely expensive AND impossible-to- get front-row-seats, (and the ability to wander the stage during the shows), and watch a fine sampling of some of time's most mysterious concerts. Royal Albert Hall, home of Mozart, Brahms, et.al. Earl's Court, London, Madison Square Garden, and more. THESE ARE STOPS ON THIS TOUR!<br />WELL, readers, THAT is EXACTLY what Atlantic and Warner Brothers have done for EACH OF YOU!! I saw 5 of Zep's live shows, and, regardless of how many times I saw them, I wanted MORE. Every show was different, every show had it's own stars, its own personality. I never saw enough of them.. Always wanted more: Well, HERE IT IS!!<br />While this is not a visual record of the very best audio performances, it does quantify EXACTLY the other important side of Zep: The Fabulous visual stage show you got, whenever Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant got into their psychic hotline dual riffs. Or whenever Pagey and John Bonham, rock's finest percussionist, got into THEIR telepathic rock-beat connection, and hooked onto an extemporaneous, innovative jam. It's all here. Jimmy Page does some fine (not his best, but mighty fine) work here. Robert's voice, as usual, is stratospheric, although the echoplex that marked many of the live shows, is often missing. <br />These are the tunes, the shows, that cost me a load of A's, turning them into low B's or C's, when I spent whole nights driving 200-400-590 miles back to college, and showing up late for pop quizes I was not exactly up to scratch for...<br />The 1st DVD, even though dated, through the end of DVD 2, spans the entire career of the ZEP, from the first month (Danish Radio Show) to the nearly last show, Zep's fine job at the 1979 Knebworth Concert for reading disabled kids. In between is a ton of just plain magic moments. For those of you who weren't around, then, I suggest you dig up tapes of the OTHER contemporary groups' live material (in 1969/70) at that time. Most other (even major groups) live shows were loud, out of tune, raucous garbage. NOT SO, HERE! While not letter perfect, this is some amazing, timeless stuff; WAAAYY ahead of its time...<br />As we said about the How the West Was Won CD's, their best AUDIO material is THERE. However, for those of you wanting to SEE a fabulous VISUAL ROCK SHOW, complete with Page doing his amazing leads while spending 97% of his time step dancing, Irish river dancing, moonwalking, jumping (yes, jumping), playing guitar on a knee, behind his back, or playing guitar leads over his head, and doing anything but watching the neck of his guitar! With Robert Plant showing off his tight jeans, and swagger, Bonham showing everyone how drums are REALLY played; or John Paul Jones, playing a row of synth winds with one hand, strings with his other hand, and bass on his footpedals; THIS is your ticket to a real, real fun time, and top notch musicians/showmen!! <br />Plenty for all to see and hear. Rock and Roll. Metal; Page's Violin Bow seques, other-worldy theremin, exemplary guitar solo work (As in the amazing White Summer/Black Mountainside); kick ...rock, as In My Time of Dying, and an unbeleivably tight Trampled Under Foot, made all the more incredible, because one of Jimmy's E strings breaks 2/3 of the way into the song. Can You Tell? NOPE... These back to back rockers stomp that rock beast into the dust. These guys DEFINE professionalism...<br />Beautiful acoustic sets, with Zep III and IV's best folk work adorn DVD 2. Then, after aforesaid InMyTime.. and Trampled, a triumphant romp through the years, and the hits at Knebworth '79, to top it all off. If you're not a Zep fan, don't bother. There isn't much here that will change your mind. But for those of you who LIKE Led Zeppelin, you will LOVE THESE SHOWS.<br />All in all, an incredible, amazing experience, I will enjoy this DVD set for the rest of my life. And remember times, and events, in clarity, with some of the greatest songs of all times, to go along with them. This is one DVD set every fan of rock and roll needs in the collection. Preferably at the front. Thanks, Atlantic, and Warner, and Jimmy, John, John Paul, and Robert!! Thanks for such great tunes & great memories!!
B00005U11Z|5.0|I have been a fan of Journey since the 70's and no one can ever replace Steve Perry.....period. But I must admit that Steve Augeri did a wonderful job in \\"impersonating\\" Steve Perry. But there is one small difference.....Steve Perry has a higher vocal range. Having that clarified, a standing ovation should be given to Augeri as he delivered all of Journey's songs to almost perfection. Its an awesome performance by Journey especially Deen Castronovo and ofcourse Neal Schon which brought back memories of my youth days. Wish more DVD concerts by Journey will be available in the near future.
0380002930|5.0|An absolutely fascinating tale of adventure!! The story is told from the view point of a group of rabbits.  It chronicles their adventures as they leave their old warren and set out to establish a new warren.  On their journey they encounter many elil (foes) and things that are not natural to a rabbit's nature.  As you are carried along, you &quot;learn&quot; much about the rabbits nature and heritage.  I would recommend this book to any animal lover.  I would begin to use this book with freshmen.  I will most likely read this several more times in my life.
0142004235|5.0|I am NOT - repeat - NOT a reader. But I've just discovered 2 books that knocked my socks off. One fiction; one non-fiction. The non-fiction, Make Every Girl Want You, showed me how women want to be treated; the fiction book, East of Eden, was BETTER than Of Mice & Men & Grapes of Wrath. Although maybe that's because I was FORCED to read the others back in high school! I loved the biblical references throughout this piece of art. It takes place between the Civil War & World War I, & features 2 sets of brothers. I guess I can really relate to this because I have 2 brothers, I we have gone through similar circumstances (although, luckily, in times of peace, not war). Anyway, great read - Kudos to Oprah. I couldn't put it down, & I'm not typically one to read novels!
630027120X|4.0|While I wish this movie was written about Protestant missionaries, I cannot deny how awe inspiring &quot;The Mission&quot; is.  Robert DeNiro, up to usual form, plays a convincing mercenary (slaver), and later, a convert to Catholicism.  <br />By watching this movie, not only will one learn the basics of Catholic theology, but one will also understand the culture of Spanish/Portuguese MERCENARY ACTIVITIES in colonial South America.  It is an IMPORTANT part of WORLD HISTORY, which oddly enough, is rarely examined.  Even for the areligious, this movie will not be a waste of time.
B000002UA0|3.0|I bought this CD probably a year or so ago, and I figured that it would be interesting to hear a Pink Floyd album with Syd Barret as the lead guitar/vocals, instead of Gilmour.  However, outside of a few choice songs, I was fairly unimpressed with it.  Astronomy Domine, Lucifer Sam, Chapter 24, Scarecrow, and Bike were among my favorite on the album, and as for the others, they failed to impress.  Interstellar Overdrive, for example, I believe that it is overrated for  what it is, due to the fact I have seen it heralded as one of the best psychedelic songs ever.  <br />As for the songs on the album that I personally liked, they could be found on most of the compilations that Pink Floyd have put out over the years, such as Echoes or even one of their live albums, like P.U.L.S.E.  Overall, its a wash, I would recommend it only for nostalgic value or for someone who is truly into the very earliest Pink Floyd or the psychedelic feel of The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn as a whole.  If it were my money, I'd opt for The Wall, Dark Side Of The Moon, Animals, or Meddle, personally.
B00008R9M0|3.0|I didn't think this sequel to Men in Black was as clever or as fun as the original, but the effects were good and Will Smith and Rip Torn are always fun to watch. Lara Flynn Boyle was not as wickedly fun as Linda Fiorentino, but by all accounts maybe she is easier to work with :-) I thought Tommy Lee Jones was not nearly as funny as he was in the first film; instead of being deadpan, he seems bored here, and rightly so. The action and settings are very similar to the first MiB, though creature design and makeup is very good.<br /><br />DVD extras are average. There is a trailer; a teaser; an ad for the MIB Deluxe edition; trailers for Spider Man, Ghostbusters and Mask of Zorro; a fun animated short, The Chubb Chubbs; and a Crossfire game demo (which didn't work on my computer). There is also a commentary track by director Sonnenfeld, and the film can be heard or subtitled in English or French.

B00000J7JO|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers seem to be a bit less \\"Red Hot\\" these days. They're still making very good music, but it seems that they have mellowed with age. Just compare Californication to Mother's Milk, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan or even Blood Sugar Sex Magik and you'll see that the RHCPs have definitely chilled out a bit. Pretty much gone is the frantic funk-rap-rock style of earlier days, now the Peppers seem more interested in crafting pretty melodies. This is a much more radio-friendly group than the one that brought us \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Power Of Equality\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\". <br />I think Californication is a good album with a lot of great songs, but frankly it just doesn't rock enough. Compared with Blood Sugar Sex Magik which had great songs, a tight groove, plenty of hard-rockers, a lot of funk, and a very high energy level, Californication seems sedated in comparison. Not that that's bad, it's just a new direction for the band. However, I must say that I prefer the old Chili Peppers. There are a few tracks on the album that approach the funky rockin' style of Blood Sugar Sex Magik such as \\"Around The World\\", \\"I Like Dirt\\" and \\"Get On Top\\", but it's mostly polished pop/rock without much of a trace of the Peppers' distinct style.<br />Californication is certainly one of their better albums, but fans of the old-school Chili Peppers may be a bit dismayed. Many of the songs sound tailor-made for radio and are missing that late 80s/early 90s energy. This is a fine album, and I'm glad it was a success, but Blood Sugar Sex Magik went platinum many times over without the benefit of such a radio-friendly sound, and even with the disadvantage of an \\"explicit lyrics\\" sticker (meaning no Wal-Mart sales). <br />I enjoy this album, but when I want a taste of the real Red Hot Chili Peppers, I will cue up Mother's Milk or Blood Sugar Sex Magik.
0375414053|2.0|Pearson is a talented writer who does weave very funny tidbits into her work, but at its core this is a terrible book that sends all the wrong messages about working mothers.  Our protagonist is a woman who is miserable to her husband, contemplates an affair, barely spends time with her children and when she does, is short with them.  And the end leaves the reader with the message that the only way to salvage your marriage and get to know your children is to quit your job - how awful!<br />I'm a working mom with young twin daughters, and I did NOT see myself in this book.  I was so disappointed - from everything I'd heard it was supposed to be this breakthrough novel that wittily and heartbreakingly depicted the life of your typical working mom.  Not so.  A step backwards into one-dimensional stereotypes, I think.
B000099T2L|2.0|This cd was not what I expected.  I knew it was going to be different because she didn't want it to be another DC record but this cd was not all that good.  Beyonce has a great voice but this cd was all over the place.  There are a couple bright spots on the cd but not many.  I think she should have not remade the closer I get to you.  Please leave that to Donny &amp; Roberta Flack, I was so disappointed in that remake. If you have not purchased this CD yet, Please listen to me and do not.  If you really want it for your collection buy it used because its not worth the full retail price. Trust me I was disappointed and wished I didn't buy it. I recommend the Kelly Rowland CD instead of the Beyonce cd.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is one of the most entertaining shows on television! I think that \\"A viewer from USA\\" has got things mixed up. He or she must be hatin on the show because he didn't get a call back from the producers. <br />I have spoken to numerous people -- all ages, that LOVE Smallville. From the moment you watch it, not matter how far along into the show you are, it will hook you. The drama, the excitement, suspense...Smallville has it all. The characters are brilliantly cast, Tom Welling gives a brilliant performance, Kristin Kreuk is beautiful, Mark Rosenbaum is awesome! What more can you ask from a TV Show? <br />Buy this NOW~ You'll Love it!
B000002UAX|5.0|This record is absolute brilliance. The only song that I think should be reconsidered is Revolution 9, and even that's good for a laugh. Talk of making this a single Lp shouldn't exist, unless you would make it a 29 song single Lp. It covers a large number of different genres from Country to Rock to Reggae to Punk. It is all you'll ever need packed into one double LP<br />Best Song - Helter Skelter<BR>Worst Song - Revolution 9
B000002JSV|5.0|After Highway To Hell and the radio-friendly Back In Black, this is AC/DC's BEST album.  Two words....BUY IT!!
B00003CX95|5.0|If you are into fighting and war movies pick this one up. It has some of the best fight scenes to ever be in a film. Mel Gibson being one of my favorite actors playing the lead role in my favorite movie, it just doesnt get any better than this. If you have the time i suggest reading the books about Sir William Wallace. A little sidenote to biff or whoever it was that made the comment about him noticing about Wallace throwing rocks with different hands, maybe you should know that back at that time in the late 1200's men were encouraged to use both hands equally as good, just a little lesson for you today. Check your information before you put it down in writing. I'd like to thank Mr. Gibson for taking the role as Sir William Wallace i dont think anyone could have done it better.
B000002J09|5.0|any body who could possibly diss this album knows nothing about rock because this is so obviously the best hard rock album ever (just a little better than back in black). All the tracks are amazingly produced and are good songs however they may be produced. From the guitar insanity of god#2(Jimmy Page) to the amazing vocal range of Robert Plant to the amazing talent and coordination of John Paul Jones and Bonzo all combining their forces to make songs such as the ridiculously good and saldy overplayed stairway to heaven to the bluestastic WTLB it kicks an unbelievable amount of derriere.
B00008NG5V|5.0|If you haven't yet heard of jack johnson, you really need to get with it. He's got such a soothing voice and his acoustic guitar melodies are addicting. i recommend trying out his first album, Brushfire Fairytales, as well. If you don't know where to start, try listening to &quot;The Horizon Has Been Defeated.&quot; It's catchy (they play it on the radio here all the time) and it's just plain good.

B00005JLYU|1.0|If you are looking for a fun Grrl Power movie, this is NOT it. <br />After listening to Drew's interview on Letterman, I thought that it would be an empowering and fun movie to go see.  In Barrymore's interview, she described it as a movie that has something for the girls and the guys.  <br />Girls, don't bother.  The movie was like soft porn (plotless) or a Mariah Carey music video gone bad (cheesy). Stiletto heels, too many girl on girl innuendo's, and bad lingerie.  Think Victoria's Secret Angels that spank each other. It's a men's magazine cover brought to life.<br />I've always been a fan of Drew Barrymore, but she has lost me on this one. It seems wrong to be told that this movie is empowering for women or that this is the James Bond for women.  James Bond is not performing stunts half naked and in shoes that make his legs look longer :-) We understand that the movie is a campy play on the original, but don't try and tell us girls that it is anything else.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is a prime example of what every album should be.  There is not a weak point on this entire album.  It starts off with Aces High, which in my opinion is their greatest opener and one of their best songs ever.  With its fast paced drum beat, dueling guitars, and the high pitched wail of Bruce Dickinson, it makes for the perfect opening to this album.  Steve Harris bass work as always is incredible, and it can actually be heard which is not true in most metal bands.  2 Minutes to Midnight is a catchy tune with a great chorus which can be stuck in your head for days.  Losfer Words is a nice little instrumental which displays the musical talent of each of the members.  Flash of the Blade and The Duellists are both great songs, both with incredible guitar harmonies of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith.  The title track, Powerslave, is themed in Ancient Egypt during the time of the Pharaohs, and the guitar riff goes great with the theme.  Powerslave also has one of the best solos ever.  The album closes with the 13 minute epic, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, also another Maiden classic.  From beginning to end, this album is flawless.
B00005JKN9|5.0|'Gangs of New York' is not a film to be taken lightly, or taken as a tonic to the ugly nature of life. The film, as with the history, is gritty, uncompromising, and in the end heart-breakingly poignant. <br />Leonardo DiCaprio played his toughest role yet as Amsterdam Vallon, the orphaned son of 'Priest Vallon', killed in the gang wars that rocked New York in the mid nineteenth century. DiCaprio has often been accused of being too soft and feckless an actor, 'Gangs' shatters such stereotype...his Amsterdam is neither soft nor careless, but a hero of the darkest and purest sort.<br />Daniel Day Lewis follows as 'Bill the Butcher', and his villian is skillfully wrought and complex, a haunting character that remains in one's mind long after the show is over. <br />Scorsese's vision was brought to life in a lasting and masterful way with 'Gangs'. You'll never look at history, or humanity, the same way again.
B00003CX9E|5.0|...just how groundbreaking this film was in its time.  Perhaps we're spoiled by it.  Great characterizations, unconventional (for its time) structure, beautiful and effective photography by Gregg Toland and stunning performances that make this film what it is.  So rarely do the full complement of elements in a production work this well together.<br />The real treat of this DVD, of course, is the fact that not only is there the film itself, but also a fantastic documentary on Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for the character of Kane).  It's an episode of the PBS series 'The American Experience' and it reveals a great deal about the circumstances leading up to the production of the film (as well as a detailed recounting of the conflict between Hearst and the Welles camp before and after the film's release).
B000099T2L|5.0|I didn't believe that I would ever say something like this, but I love Beyonce. I've never liked her. I never thought she could sing. I didn't think she could write. But all of these thoughts were dispelled when I got her cd. I figured I'd get it because I found it for ten dollars and I liked \\"Crazy In Love\\". So here is what I found:<BR>1. \\"Crazy in Love\\"- good song, of course. it's always on the radio<BR>2. \\"Naughty girl\\"- like most of her cd, has an old school feel. also has a good beat. good song<BR>3. \\"Baby Boy\\"- with Sean Paul, good song. good beat.<BR>4. \\"Hip Hop Star\\"- great beat, different and typical of Outkast. Big Boi is in the song. <BR>5. \\"Be With You\\"- another old school beat. this song is one of my favorites. <BR>6. \\" Me, Myself And I\\"- Another favorite of mine. Great lyrics and a relaxing, laid back feel<BR>7. \\" Yes\\"- another good beat. good lyrics. good song<BR>8. \\" Signs\\"- produced by Missy Elliott, so of course it's just  another good beat on this album. the song is ok, but it sounds like tyrese's new song.<BR>9. \\" Speechless\\"- sexy and smooth, the vocals on this song are excellent, another favorite.<BR>10. \\" That's How You Like It\\"- I don't really listen to this, I'm not a Jay-Z fan. But I'm sure it's good<BR>11. \\" The Closer I Get To You\\"- duet with Luther Vandross. nicely done.<BR>12. \\" Dangerously in Love 2\\"- as we all know, this is a Destniy's Child song. I loved this song then and i love it now with its slighty different beat.<BR>13. \\" Beyonce Interlude\\"- leads to the next song, spoken<BR>14. \\" Gift From Virgo\\"- a love song, cute.<BR>15. I'm not sure what the name of this song is because it is a bonus track. It is a song written for her father, Matthew Knowles. This is a beautiful song. Great lyrics and very touching. Possibly the most heartfelt song on the cd. Excellent.<BR>In conclusion, this is a very good cd. You probably felt like me, wary of purchasing Beyonce's cd. But I'm very happy that I did. I personally love slow songs and thereare a good number of them. Each is nicely done. But there are still a few upbeat songs. The vocals are impressive. Her songwriting skills have greatly improved. And the production on the album is excellent, which she did most of. I am shocked and pleasantly surprised that Beyonce has made such a good cd. So go buy it.
055357342X|5.0|That's absolutely correct...I have no idea how he does it, but honest to goodness this series just keeps getting better!  I have read hundreds and hundreds of novels in my life, but I can not begin to tell you just how amazing this book is.  George R.R. Martin is simply the absolute master.  Recently I've read a tremendous number of fantasy novels (e.g. Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, War of the Flowers, Dark Elf Trilogy, Riftwar Saga, Icewind Dale Trilogy, etc).  Nothing else I've read compares to this book.  The characterizations are fascinating. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, Martin sends one of your favorite characters on a spiral. I must say I sat there with my mouth wide open and jaw dropped in awe during the Red Wedding scene....amazing...applause, applause, applause...If you haven't read either this book or this entire series by Martin you are truly missing out.  This is the series not to be missed.  I never thought I'd say I wished a 1200 page book was longer, but I'm really upset that the books done and I have to wait several more months (April 2004) until the next in the series arrives (A Feast for Crows).  Go buy this book and read it. You won't be disappointed.

B000060MWU|2.0|As an ultimate fan of Lynch's work, I am really shocked by this dismal Canadian edition of the truly magnificent Lost Highway - Lynch's truly &quot;grande oeuvre&quot;. It's a shame, to say the least, that such a piece of art could be demeaned in such a way by the horrid quality of this recording. And I certainly cant believe Lynch himself would have approved of this outrage. Get the film by all means, but please dont buy this DVD!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I do not write many bad reviews.  I loved her Music CD, it was great.  This cd however is Horrible.  I can not stand it.  The songs do not have catchy beats that flow, it just sounds like bad garage music...  I was really excited to hear the MUSIC  follow up but in this case I was extremely disappointed.  I am really sorry to all the fans who read this, do not  take it personal this is my opinion, thanks.

B00005JKNC|2.0|We have all seen this movie before.  A gem of a guy in unjustly accused of un-Americanism.  His life starts to fall apart-but the audience (and those around him in the movie) sees what a good and standup character he really is.  Time comes to face his accusers.  In a fit of indignation and outrage our man sets the whole thing right making everyone come to terms with their higher principles and bring shame to those who tried to bring him low.<br />The problem with this storyline is that it tries to say two contradictory things at once.  On the one hand, \\"how dare you accuse him (me or them) of harboring such nefarious and dark sentiments\\".  On the other hand, \\"well, even if I were a communist, what harm is there in that.  I am an American and I am entitled to think and say what I want.  Maybe I'm a better American for doing just that!\\"<br />Well, which is it?  Either one is saying that being an \\"enemy of liberty\\" is such a serious charge that no one should be accused carelessly or lightly or one is saying that the only \\"enemies of liberty\\" are those who suspect there are subversives among us.<br />It always amuses me that Hollywood on this score doesn't have the courage of its convictions.  The main character is always someone unfairly accused of being a communist-never someone who is an actual communist himself.  Many believe there is nothing inherently unpatriotic or un-American in being a communist.  This belief is not uncommon and many Americans honorably believe it.  If that is so, why not make the point even clearer by making the main character a young idealistic communist who simply wants justice for even the least of us?<br />The dirty secret is that as much as we may profess freedom of thought and pluralism in the land of liberty we instinctively know that some are beyond the pale.  Instead of a communist, make the main character a nazi and you will see the storyline all falls apart.  Any one is perfectly free in this land of freedom to believe that Adolph Hitler was on to something.  But by any definition of what it means to believe in America, such a belief in Hitler is corrosive and reprehensible.  It may be wise to barely tolerate Nazis among us instead of outlawing them; but we cannot hide from the fact that as such Nazism is and has been dangerous and lethal.<br />When it comes to communism and communists in America, for all their sufferings--both real and imagined--, those who were actual communists, those who flirted with communism, those who were sympathetic and those who were just along for the ride have yet to be called to account.  For all their high idealism and good intentions, what they actually advocated, brought and defended was a system which crushed the defenseless, imprisoned many, starved more, and denied liberties to all in its reach.  Tens of millions were killed and untold human misery was unleashed all in the name of a more perfect society.<br />Undoubtedly, many good people were communists and all in all they should have been left alone.  But it should be remembered that as these \\"good people\\" basked in their \\"good intentions\\" evil was committed in their names.  The term is  \\"witch-hunt\\" frequently used in talking about the 1950's.  Among the many things the use of the term implies is that \\"of course, there are no such things as witches\\".  The trouble is that any fair observation of those times would admit that there were such \\"witches\\".  It is a lie to suggest there weren't.itler was on to something.

B000001ESP|5.0|After composong bombastic, long and compicated progressive rock masterpieces (\\"hemispheres\\",\\"farewell to kings\\" ,\\"2112\\")Rush slowly started to join the mainstrem (\\"permanent waves\\")<br />\\"Moving pictures\\" is another part of groups evolution.<br />\\"Moving pictures\\" also became one of bestselling and popular album by rush, and tere is still no explanation for it. in the beginning of eighties where new wave and synth-pop were on the highlights Rush shown that there is still a place for original, fresh and ambitious piece of Music.it's like they shouted ot everyone - \\"HEY! WE'RE STILL HERE AND WE ROCK!\\" <br />there are 7 songs here - about 40 minutes of music.<BR>And what about music??? <BR>Rush made a new quality in rock.on this one they were still on their top - while members of the band Geddy, Alex and Neill were all genoius musicians and also talented composers they mixed radio-friendly melodies with progressive structures and really VERY HARD to play bridges and parts. <br />BEst example : listen to their hit single \\"Tom Sawyer\\" - after catchy main motive and verse we got a wierd keyboard and guitar solos along with angry bass guitar accompaniament, then chorus and verse and later also we have that strange keyboard thing...<BR>what kind of a band would do that in pop hit??? even today???<br />or \\"YYZ\\" - the really complicated and rocking instrumental with NO-ONE-CAN-PLAY-LIKE-THAT bass,drums and guitar solos, without any really catchy parts, without any verses even, but it is still so interesting and \\"magic\\" that is really staying long in your head... all songs from here has got a \\"Soul\\" in it....<br />Classic rockers like \\"Red Barchetta\\" or \\"Limelight\\" with powerfull guitar riffs are great to listen at full volume and to listen it in your car while being on a road trip.I tell you that they can give you such a big kick of power that you will surely be singing and banging your head in rhe rhythm of the [songs!!!] <br />Rush is also creating very dark and intensive atmosphere in \\"Witch hunt\\" (about inquisition era) and \\"Camera eye\\" (long 11 minutes long epic tale about the people living in New york and london).<BR>But in the end Rush is showing more smiling face with \\"Vital Signs\\" - synth-driven and new-wave influenced tune with very interesting and fun lyrics.<br />\\"Moving pictures\\" is still impresuive piece of Rock music.<BR>The another fact about how great Rush is, is that this album is still sounding like it was recorded few years ago. i tested it on my friend - after listening to \\"Tom sawyer\\" (he did not knew this song before) he thought that it is from middle nineties or something close to [it!!!] <br />the fact is that it was recorded 22 years [ago!!!]<BR>this is a great thing to record an album that is sounding so fresh and vibrant after so many [years...]<br />If you never heard of rush \\"Moving Pictures\\" may be the best introduction to their wonderfull music. <br />But be carefull not to listen it too much - once you will put it to your cd player it will be hard to turn it [off...]
B000067J1H|5.0|I saw this movie in theater.  I didn't mean to, I entered the wrong theater at the cineplex.  As soon as I saw the opening credit sequence, I stayed.  I now cannot tell you what movie I was originally going to see, but I know that it wasn't as good as this movie.  This is a movie for everyone.  It has love, hate, depression, insomnia, insanity, intensity, and soap.  Feel the fury, reach deep inside, and find the Fight Clubber in you.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The self titled debut album from Audioslave is one not to miss. Consisting of the ex-members of Rage Against the Machine (minus Zach) and ex-Soundgarden crooner Chris Cornell, Audioslave succesfully managed to deliver an album chock full of equally explosive and meaningfully crafted tracks. &quot;Cochise&quot;, the first single is a standard rock song, a perfect choice to open the album. Standout tracks include the excellently written, performed, and recorded &quot;Like A Stone&quot; (the second single) and &quot;Getaway Car&quot; (one of my personal favorites). If you're looking for a great modern rock album, look no further. Audioslave is here to stay.
B000002N3N|5.0|The Memory of Trees is one of enya's most powerful albums. By far the best song on the cd is Anywhere Is. It will have you singing along and feeling happy and uplifted once you here it. On My Way Home is also a great oneto sing along to. If you're a new listener or not very familiar with enya, this one is the one to buy first. The best ones are The Memory of Trees, Anywhere Is, Pax Deorum. Athair Ar Neamh, Hope Has a Place, La Sonadora and On My way Home. You'll have hours of musical pleasure listening to this one!
B000089RVX|1.0|Attention Evanescence fans! Let me take a minute to explain in a blunt manner the significance of this band. Evanescence= Linkin Park + Attractive Female Vocalist. Linkin Park = Trash. Trash + Female Vocalist = an obvious sales gimmick devised by recording executives to get mindless drones such as LP fans to purchase more MTV filler garbage. This band will die out sooner than you think. Don't waste your money on this. Despite the fact that the band themselves and the media labels their music as \\"Metal\\" or even \\"Nu-Metal\\" is pure idiocy. You want metal? Get Slayer, old Metallica, Hatebreed, Manson, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Fear Factory, Cannible Corpse, and thousands more to choose from. Not Evanescence...
B000050XEI|5.0|This is enya's lightest, happiest album. Great for listening during a bad mood or doing some sort of tedious work. It's a great one for those who aren't very familiar with enya's music. I have all of her cds and this one is one of the best. The best songs on the album are Wild Child, Only Time (of course!), Tempus Vernum, Flora's Secret, Silver Inches, One by One, and Lazy Days. You won't be disapointed!
0385335482|5.0|I absolutely loved &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; by Sophie Kinsella. It was so much fun to read, and you never know what Becky Bloomwood is going to do next. She struggles so much to get what she wants, and in the end, it somehow works out. There is plenty of romance, mistakes, anger, and humor in this book. Anybody can relate to Becky. If you haven't read this book, you need to.
B000024QML|5.0|ok, as i say above, i listened this album for a long time without knowing what it is really about.. but hey, emotions are for everybody right?  i think this album is as emotion-intensive as anything can be and there is great art of expressing it the best possible way. i remember the times that it first hit the markets and all.. and in my innermost, i still listen the songs in this album the way i want to hear them. and interesting: i used to listen this along with my other favorite stuff, iron maiden, meat loaf, bon jovi, REM etc.. so i say this: art is art and you will see the finest a pop album can offer in this one. the boys are not only artistic and creative but they are also very SMART as you will find out as you listen.. it is PERFECT.
0689859368|5.0|This is a great book for children and adults to read together. My daughter had a hard time with the length of the Harry Potter books, and while she loves them they were a bit too difficult for her to read on her own. These books are wonderful, they have all the things kids want to read about... Goblins, Faeries, secret rooms, great characters, and so much more. Another plus is that the book is written in a way as to keep them involved in the story, and they don't want to put it down, but the big plus is that the book isn't too lengthy... My daughter wishes the whole set was available since she has read 1 & 2 and is dieing to know what happens next! I recommend you get these books right away!

B000001EUR|5.0|Scorpions were one of the best heavy metal bands of the 70's and 80's. Germany's biggest music act ever, the Scorpions have become hard rock gods all over the world. They are in the company of legends such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy, and Judas Priest. This is one of their best albums. It is their most popular album from the 80's. Klaus Meine has a great set of pipes. The German accent sounds cool with metal. Get this one, it's a classic.
B000089RVX|3.0|Despite all the hype built around Evanescence and their album &quot;Fallen&quot;, this band is much better than one might think.  Their contributions on the Daredevil soundtrack were some of the only listenable material for me, and while their full length debut may not be perfect, it is surprisingly good.  Vocalist Amy Lee has a voice that puts a number of other female vocalists to shame, and the only real flaw of the band as a whole is that they have an almost too nu-metal sound.  Standout tracks include &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;My Tourniquet&quot;, and &quot;My Last Breath&quot;, while the hit single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; can grow unlistenable after repeated listenings.  I cannot understand either why so many people compare Evanescence to Linkin Park.  This band has more talent in their nosehairs than Linkin Park has as a whole combined unit.  All in all, &quot;Fallen&quot; may be a bit overrated, but it is much better than I thought it would be; it's just too bad that Evanescence is stuck on Wind-Up records.
B00008G9JO|5.0|&gt;&gt;&quot;You're not interested in reviewing the record either, are you?&quot;<br />Apparently you are correct in a sense in that this person is not as interested in reviewing the record as you are. Then again, no one else seems to be so interested as to log in numerous times to keep saying the SAME THING.<br />&gt;&gt;&quot;It's a damm [sic] good CD&quot;, is not a review; it's cheerleading.&quot;<br />And yet, it's far more refreshing to this reader than your extremely off base nitpicks that do more than border on sophomoric absurdness.<br />&gt;&gt;&quot;The point of this page is to try to give those of us who don't already know the songs (for whom the songs cannot thus &quot;stand up&quot; for themselves) some reasonable idea of what to expect.&quot;<br />If this was &quot;the point&quot;, you failed miserably, whoever you are, &quot;music fan&quot;. Whether this be the critique of the Acres Wild lyric (limiting metaphors is indicative of a limited imagination), the accusation that this album is limited in musical substance (try playing, say, the title cut on any instrument), or the hapless claim that Anderson's voice was inappropriate or not up to scratch (okay, if you can sing &quot;No Lullaby&quot; with any degree of competency, you've won this little debate), you're off base here, to put it kindly.<br />And now, onto the album.<br />Drumming: Barrie Barlow shines on this record, with a plethora of different patterns and textures to drive the songs along. Check out the subtleties in &quot;Journeyman&quot;, they are tastefully restrained and satisfying.<br />Electric Guitar: Martin cuts loose here and there, when Anderson gives him the room. &quot;No Lullaby&quot; includes some nice guitar harmony and can serve as a lesson in restraint for many guitarists to come. The guitar and bass are wonderfully fused within this song.<br />Keyboards: Palmer and Evan share the keyboard spot here, and work together nicely. Palmer takes more of a backseat, and offers more melodic accents to the songs that give them just that finishing touch.<br />Bass: Glascock is simply amazing. His is probably my favorite work on the album. Absolutely rigorous pacing that will tire you out.<br />Anderson: The flute is of course great here, as evidenced on the solo in Weathercock. Flute chatters over rustic acoustic guitar and keyboard which when brought together in this fashion make for some wonderful melodies.<br />Another thing I appreciate about the album is that the instruments work together to make a really distinctive sound as a collective effort.

B000020617|3.0|As poppy as &quot;Colour &amp; The Shape&quot; was, it was still raw and full of real emotion which made me fall in love with it.  And while &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; has it's share of energetic riffs and angsty lyrics, it just doesn't strike the same emotional chord that the rest of the Foo Fighters' works did.  &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; was for this album what &quot;My Hero&quot; was for &quot;Colour &amp; The Shape&quot;; an overly poppy catchy tune that while good quickly became overplayed.  The rest of the album's cuts just sound too poppy and overproduced to me, and as a whole &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; is mildly disappointing.  However, TINLTL is far from a bad album (I honestly don't think these guys could ever make such a thing), but as of this point this is the band's least best album.  Thankully, their recent &quot;One by One&quot; crushed this album and maintained the Foo's integrity combined with their mainstream aimed rock oomph.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Tom Brown Jr. who was the survivalist tech. advisor for the movie was able to show a very very small portion of the skills he has and has taught others.  That's why I love this movie so much, it shows the basic fundementals of his classes. (Which there are 32 and this shows those in the first class, haha.)  Anyway, to really appreciate, look at the small details...like how Tommy Lee Jones walks.  That is how Tom Brown and his students of a couple years walk...that's how we do a brisk walk in the woods and be quiet while walking.  Also the fishing hook made by thorn in the bush that triggers the trap, we make that for fishing.  So, if you think it would be great to walk in the woods and look at it as a safe haven, to be able to live indefinitely, make shelters, track anything, and move silently and unseen...
B000028U0Y|4.0|The clich&eacute; about Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is that a special rapport between Cash and the rough-edged, entertainment-starved audience initiated one of the most incredible performances ever captured on tape. While the whole history of great albums is written in such hyperbole, there is a certain synergy apparent on Folsom Prison that makes it a cut above the average live album.<br />Cash, who was no stranger to the inside of a cell himself, was almost the perfect performer for a prison audience. He is somber and reflective enough to echo the deepest sentiments of forlorn, weary convicts. Yet he is also dark and masculine enough to appeal to such a rough populace. It is easy to imagine the performer touching the audience and one does not even have to speculate that the audience touched the performer. Just listen to the performances. Some of the songs are playful while others somber, yet each has a sense of sincerity and realness that is absent on most live albums, many of which try too hard to be larger than life.<br />Also adding to Folsom Prison's uniqueness is the song selection. While his own \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" became the trademark cut, Cash performed just about every prison song he knew, by several authors, both solemn (\\"Send a Picture of Mother,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" \\"Grey Stone Chapel,\\" the last of which was written by Glenn Shirley, then an inmate in the audience) and madcap ones (\\"I Got Stripes,\\" \\"Joe Bean,\\" \\"Cocaine Blues,\\" \\"25 Minutes to Go\\"). The album works just as well as a musical short story collection as it does a live album and considering what a top-notch live album it is, that is saying a lot.
B000002GY9|5.0|Tom Waits is a great American poet, a genius who has created an entire lyric world where somehow wasted life is full of value.  For Marcel Proust to find meaning in the rich atmospheres of his priveleged childhood... where's the talent in that?  But for a writer to find deep, plaintive meaning in a life spent loitering by a cigarette machine at a dog track... There is a Catholic saint who is reported to have defiled himself in dissolution in sympathy with all the wretches of the world, saying he would not be saved if there was one sinner who was lost.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Few albums in recent memory - heck, few albums period - are as emotion-rendering as Johnny Cash's latest, American IV: The Man Comes Around. As the title indicates, American IV is the latest installment of Cash's unlikely union with American Recordings, the label of famed hip-hop and metal producer, Rick Rubin. The album maintains the defining traits of Cash's previous American efforts: somber atmosphere, sparse accompaniment and a reliance on cover songs, many of them surprising. But, whereas American I though III delivered all kinds of dark deliberations, American IV focuses on thoughts of frailty and mortality, perhaps inspired by Cash's recent health problems. The singer is unafraid to sound like an ailing 70-year old and that is what makes American IV such an extraordinary experience.<br />With only one new original, the Revelations-themed \\"The Man Comes Around,\\" American IV can hardly be called an autobiographical album. Yet almost every song, be it old standard, rock classic or relatively recent composition, seems selected to express the ruminations of a man in Cash's condition.<br />Likewise, most of the songs deal in reflections, regrets and farewells. The most powerful is easily Cash's chilling rendition of Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt.\\" Cash's trembling, yet resounding baritone give Trent Reznor's morbid meditation on faith and failure take on a whole new power. Next best is Cash's version of a much different song, English folk-singer, Ewan MacColl's immortal \\"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face.\\" On this track, Cash's voice becomes as rich, warm and ephemeral as the memories the verses describe. Also excellent are The Beatles' \\"In My Life\\" and The Eagles' \\"Desperado,\\" both world-weary songs that sounded strange from their twenty-something authors and are easily assimilated by Cash.<br />Not every moment on American IV is so mournful, though (Although the album maintains its poignancy throughout). Simon &amp; Garfunkel's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" and Vera Lynn's WWII standard \\"We'll Meet Again,\\" were meant to be songs of hope and Cash certainly respects this, recording heartening, faithful renditions. A more unlikely upbeat track is Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus.\\" The traditional-country approach makes a song that once seemed blasphemous sound spiritual.<br />American IV has two flaws, though. The first is unnecessary guest appearances. The song's author, Don Henley, adds nothing but irksome mumbles, singing back-up on \\"Desperado\\" and Fiona Apple sounds similarly lost on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" The other flaw is a handful of re-recordings of songs Cash released years ago. Does anyone really need a new version of \\"Sam Hall\\" or \\"Give My Love to Rose?\\" These tracks can be written off as filler (An exception to both rules is a new \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\\" a beautifully melancholy duet with Nick Cave). But these are minor complaints about an otherwise exceptional album. Taken as a whole, American IV is one of the most poignant experiences available on record in recent years.

B00001SIES|5.0|For a long time I was searching who was behind the song in the Imac burner's ad from Apple.  Well it was Muse with their famous \\"Sunburn\\" song.  Then I went to listen samples of their album on the net, to my surprise, I found a well done album that I would listen in its entirety.  To my great pleasure, singer is mourning in the same way of Thom Yorke of Radiohead (we need references to understand things).<br />\\"Showbiz\\" is my favorite song. \\"Sunburn\\" is quite something too and refers me to James Bond!!! \\"Falling down\\" makes me think of \\"Ten years gone\\" from Led Zeppelin. \\"Unintended\\" is kind of lullaby where he demonstrate well his talented voice.  \\"Sober\\" has a little bit of Yes in it (starting at 41 second).  \\"Hate this & I'll love you\\" is a wonderful song starting with crickets at the beginning (already done by U-2 on the famous \\"Exit song\\") but it does not matter since it has nothing else in common.<br />Great album to listen.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Like two demons emerging from the under toe Nick Oliveri and Josh Homme have created in 'songs for the deaf' an album of brutal, twisting decadence that lays down the Queens manifesto. Do what you like, when you like and with who you like and then deal with the consequences.<BR>The fact that Dave Grohl fell over himself and credits his time with Nick and Josh as having revitalised the Foo Fighters says much in itself - this is  one of the albums of 2002 in which you can live inside for months.<br />'No one knows' rampages with a hoe down riff, taking no prisoners on a journey of pillage and redemption, 'go with the flow' is sensual and nihilistic in it's modus operandi, 'just another love song' is a final jolt at a lovers split condensed into a four minute song. The rest is like a sonic explosion of Urban mayhem, lust and abandoned inhibitions.<BR>An album which blows all those preconceived thoughts about metal away - do you have the strength to defy your assumptions and make 'songs for the deaf' top of your most wanted CD list?
B000099T2L|5.0|It's not often that a cd release is deemed as critical as Beyonce's \\"Dangerously in Love.\\"  It seems that Beyonce was completely aware that fans, and foes alike will view this as a crucial milestone in her career.  I have been a fan of Beyonce since \\"No, No, No.\\"  I hung in there with all the DC drama, and now we finally have what could be one of the most refreshing surprises of the year in the world of music.<br />There are plenty of reviews here that state that this cd is far from what you would expect, especially if you are a hardcore Destiny's Child fan..  I agree as well. Actually, I was expecting an album full of jamming beats and lyrics that were put together just to make one line rhyme with another.  I'm so glad that I was dead wrong.  Beyonce has something to say about who she is AS AN ARTIST.  And she does it so well.  <br />Collectively, the most notable aspect of the cd that sticks out to me is that Beyonce's vocals are more relaxed.  She's not forcing riffs like she has done on previous DC albums.  I have two theories on this:  One:  she is relaxed because she know that this is a solo project so there is no need to stand out as the leader of a group.  Two:  she is full aware that everyone knows that she is the leader of DC and she can finally relax.  <br />It's not a clear distinction if Beyonce wants to convey where she's been or where she's going or where she would like to go.  That's the joy of this record.  It's like she could sing some of these lyrics and follow it with a giddy \\"I was just playing.\\"  She let us know that she was more than just singing cool hooks to funky beats when she amazed us with \\"Work it Out.\\"  My favorite jam on the album is \\"Naughty Girl.\\"  It brings back nostalgic feelings of Vanity 6's \\"Nasty Girl.\\"  It should definitely be the next single.  My favorite ballad is more difficult because I'm torn between \\"Me, Myself, and I,\\" \\"Yes,\\" and \\"Signs.\\"<br />What puzzles me even more is will this fusion of funk, r& b , even rock androll spill over onto the next DC record?  It would suit me just fine, but I don't think a lot of fickle fans out there would be able to handle it.<br />A+
B000093BDX|4.0|A maddening CD to listen to on headphones because of the constant alternating between stereo and mono mixes. Also, the stereo songs are louder so I was constantly adjusting the volume control. Not only is there a stereo/mono thing but also a difference between the original Sixties stereo mixes and the modern mixes. The original stereo mixes are used for the Surfer Girl LP songs that are here (Surfer Girl, Little Deuce Coupe &amp; In My Room). These primitive mixes have the instrumentation in mono but the voices coming out of both left and right speaker channels as the vocals were double-tracked. These mixes highlight the vocals, burying the instrumentation. Surfin' USA is presented in its original stereo mix which shunts off the instrumentation to the right speaker and the vocals to the left. Shut Down has a new, echoey stereo mix which I don't like. It sounds like a digital extraction mix. California Girls, Dance Dance Dance and Heroes &amp; Villains are presented in the stereo mixes presented on the Hawthorne double CD package. These mixes are outstanding. The Pet Sounds songs (Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and Sloop John B.) are presented in the stereo mixes used on the most recent Pet Sounds reissue. Songs in mono are Surfin' Safari, Be True To Your School, Fun Fun Fun, Don't Worry Baby, I Get Around, When I Grow Up, Do You Wanna Dance, Help Me Rhonda, Barbara Ann, Good Vibrations, Darlin', Wild Honey and Do It Again. <br />Also annoying is the re-arranging of the songs. The neat thing about the early Beach Boys was how Brian Wilson and the group kept growing more sophisticated and daring from 1962 through 1967. Also, the later songs tell a story of how the group tried to change with the times in the late Sixties (Heroes &amp; Villains, Darlin', Wild Honey) and later gave in to a retro sound (Rock and Roll Music, Come Go With Me, Getcha Back &amp; Kokomo) With the songs jumbled up, Brian Wilson's artistic development and the group's story get lost. For those of you who wish to hear the songs in their chronological order, here goes: 3, 4, 9, 6, 8, 13, 11, 5, 7, 2, 12, 20, 22, 10, 1, 21, 15, 16, 14, 30, 23, 27, 28, 26, 29, 19, 24, 18, 17 and 25. This will also lessen the mono/stereo problem a bit.<br />Also, the title is misleading. It should be called 30 of the Beach Boys' Top 40 Billboard Magazine Chart Hits That We Could Fit Onto A CD, Although There Was Room For One More. Only three Top 40 songs are missing: The Little Girl I Once Knew #20, Caroline No #32, and It's OK #29. Why Wild Honey #31 was included and The Little Girl I Once Knew was left off seems rather arbitrary. Many of the hits don't have a Summer Sound. Many other classic Beach Boys songs that ARE truly Summery such as All Summer Long, Your Summer Dream, Keep An Eye On Summer, etc. are not here. That was Endless Summer, which was a superior package.<br />This gets 4 stars because the songs are great. But one is better off getting the three greatest hits CDs which give you the original Brian Wilson mono mixes for the early material, which ultimately is the best way to go until all the early stuff has been remixed to stereo. Also, one CD is not enough to represent all that the Beach Boys were about.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson has always been known to shock and offend, if nothing more. He was fairly well-known in the Florida industrial underground music scene. But with this, his third album, he crosses over from underground hero to mainstream rock star, which was seemingly his intention all along. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; showcases Manson's underrated vocal and musical range. From the hard-hitting opening track &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot; to the chilling &quot;Man That You Fear&quot;, the album runs a gauntlet of emotions from angry to depressed to sinister to depraved and everything in between. Sure, this isn't &quot;feel-good&quot; music. This isn't candy-coated pop marketed to everyone. And that is a good thing. There are several tracks that stand out on this record, all for different reasons. &quot;Dried Up, Tied, and Dead to the World&quot; is a song that Manson himself said was their best, and while it may not be their best, it is still a superb song with well-crafted music and lyrics that flow and (gasp) make sense. &quot;1996&quot; is a 400 rpm hate anthem with a catchy chorus (anti-people you've come too far, here's your antichrist superstar). &quot;Wormboy&quot; is an interesting departure from the tone of the rest of the record in a sense, as it shows Manson's underrared vocal range better then any other track on the CD (you won't believe he can hit those high notes). Then there's &quot;Man That You Fear&quot;, which may be the most well-rounded track on the CD, with its dark, brooding lyrics and slow tempo. For those hard rockers among you, there is plenty of that too, as songs like the aforementioned &quot;Hate Anthem&quot; and &quot;1996&quot;, in addition to the title track, &quot;Angel with the Scabbed Wings&quot;, and &quot;Tourniquit&quot; all have an intense, heavy metal tone. That is all without mentioning radio favorite &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, one of Manson's best known songs. Granted, this album isn't for everyone. But if you have an open mind and aren't easily offended, it is worth checking out. And if you're a fan of Manson, his music, or his style, this is a definite must have.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been listening to rock music for about twenty years now, so it takes something really special to get me listen to the same record again and again and again (you get the message).<br />Simply Majestic, their combination of smooth with the rough is often attempted at by other bands but never accomplished in such an extrodinary fashion as Evanescence have managed to do so here with such ease.<br />They remind me of Iron Maiden crossed with All About Eve and a pinch of nu-metal added for good measure.  If you are wondering where the Maiden similarities come from just listen to the guitar melodies on 'Tourniquet'.<br />Excuse me but this album does something all over Metallica's 'St.Anger'.<br />Boo yah.
B00005JLWN|3.0|This movie borrows from enough famous sources to feel familiar and yet throws in some twists to keep you watching.  Set design and wardrobe definitely bring to mind, Gattica, The Matrix, even Blade Runner and Dune to a degree.  That is to say it looks mostly dark and cool. A few plot holes undermine the premise.  For example, the introductory voice-over needs to explain why some &#34;feeling&#34; is obviously legal and other forms of emotion are not.  Ambition, jealousy and pride exist, all three are in the Diggs character.  In fact, Bale is married with children and showed loyalty to the state.  All these emotions, allowed in a Prozium nation. I can forgive the casual burning of the Mona Lisa (wouldn't that be a great find for &#34;emotion hunters?&#34;) but after a brilliant fight sequence, the entire communications network was brought down by shooting out 8 or 10 workstation screens.  One last gripe:  Couldn't the producer do better than a whited-out late model Caddilac Seville as a &#34;car of the future?&#34; The good stuff?  Bale's performance was gripping; the whole premise makes the emotions he shows all the more meaningful.  By the way what was Keanu Reeve's excuse for being stiff?  The Matrix never suppressed emotion! The concept and delivery of guns married to martial arts was a fresh and stunning visual concept.  Sure, it was surreal...but it was cool!  The twists that Equilibrium uses to avoid total predictability are effective.  Namely his failure to save everyone. All in all, I enjoyed it for what it was made of: cool action, cool clothes and sets and a main character with just enough arc to keep you interested in him.
B00008LDPU|3.0|People need to sit back and ignore the hype.  This collection was NOT that great.  I used the FF button more on this DVD than any other in a while.<br /><br />FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS: The best of the lot by far.  This is one excellent piece.<br /><br />THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PARTS I & II: I guess the world is controlled by either Thuggies or Hindu, because nobody else would create an \\"archive\\" system like this.  But we did learn that man basically deserved what he got.<br /><br />KID'S STORY: Who gives a darn? Waste of disc space.

Pretty cool.<br /><br />Only about 5% of these shorts (except for FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS) had much to do with the Matrix.  It's almost as if these toons were already written, and they tacked on some plot elements at the start and end to tie them into the ovie.
B00006J9OT|2.0|I bought this CD after seeing Krall perform on BET.  She is a talented performer, but this CD is uneven.  Specifically, the selection of songs felt uninspired--even trite, and I when I heard her sing &quot;Just the Way You Are,&quot; I knew this CD did not do justice to the performance I so enjoyed on TV.
0761957553|5.0|I just started using this book, but I can tell already it is perfect.  I bought it because of the reviews it got and this book has moved me to make my first review ever.<br />HERE IS YOUR SITUATION: You are working on a research project and need to analyze some data.  But woops, you drank all through college and couldnt be bothered to attend the research methods class too often.  Now you need to not only know what the hell an ANOVA really is, but you need to produce results using SPSS.  You could ask for help, but dont want to seem like you cant work independently.<br />Folks, this book is for you.  It starts at the beginning of it all and assumes you know nothing.  In a short time you will know exactly what you are talking about and will be suggesting alternative statistical analyses that might better fit your data.<br />WOW, now you are a stats guru.<br />Is this your situation?  If so, look no further and buy it now.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I was not very convinced when I went to see the movie because I did not think that George Clooney was a good choice for the main part. Clooney carries with him this stereotype of a modern Don Juan that does not lend itself well for a drama such as Solaris.<br />As soon as the story got going, however, Don Juan was totally erased both from my mind and from the scared psychologist walking the corridors of the space station.<br />I'm not trying to sell Clooney. Actually I think that all the actors playing characters present on the space station did an outstanding job. This is one of the elements that make this movie a success. Every single expression, slight movement, silence, carries true meaning.<br />The special effects that bring the outer space and planet background into the film are done well enough that I didn't notice imperfections. I think that Steven Soderbergh was right at keeping this aspect of the movie secondary, otherwise it might have become a disturbing element. This said, I enjoyed the nice shots at Solaris added here and there because they contributed to the overall mystery.<br />And the music. It's haunting. I kept looking for a pattern but couldn't find it. However, the music seeped through my being while I was busy with the pictures and really got to me. I would hesitate buying the soundtrack, by the way, because I'm afraid that the sound without the images may not work so well. But the marriage of the two is one of the best I have experienced.<br />The pace is slow but I kept having to catch my breath, so captured I was.<br />To conclude, I would guess that not everybody will like this movie. I brought my date with me and it turned out to be a mistake. She was annoyed. So this may be turn out to be a case of all or nothing; you will either hate it or love it.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Untill about four months ago I detested the blues, in any form, then came along Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I listined to this album, and I changed my mind.  Now four months later I am heavily into the blues.  I like John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Bo Diddly, and people like that.  You could say that SRV is a gateway artist.  He is also an amazing guitar player who has never ending asortment of ideas on how to play the guitar.
0803292406|4.0|Let me first echo the sentiments expressed by others and comment on what a beautiful edition the Univ of Nebraska Press has produced. The margins are indeed wide and the type very readable. This edition is easily held, the illustrations nicely complement the text and the binding is quite durable. The introduction by Joyce Carol Oates is helpful albeit pedantic. Also, those who've read the Univ of Calif Press edition of Frankenstein will notice some overlap between this introduction and the one that Ms. Oates wrote for that particular edition. Nonetheless, the introduction is valuable.<br />Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of those stories, like Frankenstein and Dracula, that seemingly everyone has heard of and believes they understand(\\"mythopoetic \\" in the language of Joyce Carol Oates). Much like the aforementioned works, the actual details of the story may come as a surprise to those who assume they know the story based solely on the popular understanding. For that reason alone I think the book is worth reading.<br />Dr. Jekyll is a respected if somewhat reclusive London doctor who has, through the course of years of experimentation, managed to create a solution which brings to the fore his evil alter-ego. Unlike many gothic literary villains, Hyde is not imbued with superhuman strength or exceptional gifts of any kind. In fact he is of a smaller and less imposing stature than most men. What he does possess however is a complete lack of compunction with regards to others. Hyde for example ruthlessly runs down a small child who gets in his way. As others have pointed out, this book is about, at least in part, moral restraint. Mr. Hyde is a part of Dr. Jekyll.  This part was heretofore kept in check by the mores inculcated by society through child rearing practices, education, laws, et al.  An elixir that eradicates moral restraint rips at the fabric of society and reverses in one fell swoop what it has taken hundreds of years to create. <BR>As is the case with Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll creates something that he can't control and which eventually destroys its creator.    <br />Although not created by a potion, I think we see many sections in this and other societies that are are marked by anomie.  The inhumanity that the fictional Hyde displays can, not surprisingly, be seen in the non-fictional world on a daily basis. As such, there is a realism to the story which is missing from many horror stories past and present. The fact that such a short and captivating work exists in an attractively packaged edition makes this one classic that will be a joy to read for all.

Lot's of simple and delicious no cook recipies.  I like that is has lots of proven favorites, as well as basic recipes to which you can add your own favorite combinations of flavors.  One I made up used their basic recipe, but I added cinnamon and pecans.  Unbelievably good.  If you've got an ice cream maker - GET THIS BOOK!

B00009V7T2|5.0|I like to consider myself a tough reviewer so I think Mars Volta should feel very proud that I've given them 5 stars. Heh,heh. Anyway... I had to give it five stars just for its originality. Their songs really can't be defined. And that's the best thing because the more someone tries to categorize this group and give it a meaning and an image, then everything falls apart. I'm a big ATDI fan (Omar and Cedric's previous group)and I'm glad the Mars Volta steered away from the ATDI sound, but the influences and the melodies are still present. Omar's use of an effects-laden overdriven guitar is still there and the weird lyrics to accompany it. If you are one of those people trying to figure out whether you should support Mars Volta or Sparta, I would say get Sparta if you want definition and more of a stripped down rock sound, but get Mars Volta if you're looking for a fuzzed out and crazy Pink Floyd. Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who is willing to go out on a limb and listen to something different. I haven't memorized the track names or cdnow's list, but check out Drunkenship of Lanterns ( 2:05-2:44 is truly an inspirational moment),track 2 and track 8.
B00009V93Z|5.0|Following last year's release of the \\"Today, Tomorrow &amp; Forever\\" box, RCA/BMG Heritage strikes again with yet another classy 4 CD-box, containing nothing less than 89 tracks of unreleased Elvis Presley material. \\"Close Up\\" is definitely less ambitious than its predecessor, which aimed to cover the whole of Elvis' career, but focuses on some more or less interesting periods from the King's cornucopian recorded legacy. <br />Disc # 1 features 20 songs from 1957, mostly taken from the \\"Loving You\\" and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" sessions, released here in primitive (binaural) stereo. Since \\"The Essential Elvis, Vol. 2, 1957\\" these takes no longer contain any surprises, even if all the material Elvis recorded then is rock solid. Some masters can be heard now in stereo (\\"Is It So Strange\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\"), but I doubt whether these reveal anything more about the songs. They were great as they were. The outtakes released here are fascinating stuff, though (especially \\"Treat Me Nice\\", and more takes of \\"Young and Beautiful\\" and \\"Loving You\\"). <br />Disc # 2 has 25 outtakes from Elvis' early `60s movies \\"G.I. Blues\\", \\"Flaming Star\\", \\"Wild In The Country\\", and \\"Blue Hawaii\\". Even if the material is not always of the highest order, Elvis' voice was superb in those years (the songs for \\"Wild In The Country\\" are particularly appealing) and this disc gives further insight in the \\"live-in-the-studio\\" recording manner which Elvis continued to uphold, with sometimes endless takes until the final \\"perfect\\" cut was nailed down. <br />Disc # 3 is to my mind the most interesting of the box with 21 outtakes from the ever outstanding Nashville studio sessions, covering the period from 1960 to 1968. Like some of the releases in the \\"Follow That Dream\\" collector's label (\\"Long Lonely Highway\\", \\"Fame And Fortune\\", and most recently \\"Studio B\\") this disc browses through some of Elvis' most distinguished recordings of his career. &gt;Fromthe opening take 1 of \\"Make Me Know It\\" by way of the hits \\"Surrender\\", \\"His Latest Flame\\" and \\"Ask Me\\" to the closing \\"U.S. Male\\" almost eight years later, this is required listening for anyone interested in sixties rock, country, pop and gospel. <br />Disc # 4 presents the complete concert recorded on April 18, 1972 in San Antonio, Texas, parts of which have been used in the 1972 \\"Elvis On Tour\\" rockumentary, sadly, totally overlooked last year. The sound quality and the present mix are top notch. (What are you waiting for RCA/BMG to release the other taped concerts?) It is a pretty straightforward, if none too surprising concert (repertoire-wise), yet with Elvis in good spirits and good voice, virtually bringing the house down. The hysteria the man could still generate, as witnessed by this concert, is quite thrilling. Great versions of \\"Suspicious Minds\\", and of the new songs \\"For The Good Times\\" and \\"Burning Love\\". <br />\\"Close Up\\" is presented on four differently coloured discs, linked to the four chapters in the 48-page book, with excellent liner notes by Colin Escott. It contains a good selection of photos and among others useful introductions of the leading Nashville studio musicians of the sixties. Guitarists like Hank Garland, Jerry Kennedy, Grady Martin, Chip Young, and pianist Floyd Cramer, previously remained mostly uncredited, but nonetheless helped to shape Elvis' music for one of the longest periods of his career. <br />Running between 49 and 66 minutes the 4 CDs are not exactly over-generous, but all songs are presented in excellent sound quality. Even if \\"Close Up\\" doesn't hold any more surprises or real revelations (but then again, who could expect any more after all these years?), anyone interested in Elvis' recorded legacy, indeed the most remarkable and influential in popular music, doesn't need to hesitate.

B00005JKG7|5.0|After the wild success of \\"Halloween\\", I'm not sure anyone expected John Carpenter to do a movie as frightening as \\"The Fog\\". It starts out perfectly, with John Houseman (as an old salt) telling the tale of how the \\"Elizabeth Dane\\" sank off \\"Spivey Point\\", drowning all aboard. He tells this story to a group of kids at exactly 11:55 pm (you'll understand why this is significant when you see it). This is a classic intro to a classic chiller! Adrienne Barbeau stars as disc jockey / KAB radio owner \\"Stevie Wayne\\", broadcasting from  her lighthouse radio station. Jamie Lee (Halloween) Curtis is Beth, a hitchhiker on her way to Vancouver. Hal Holbrook is the Priest of the local church. He uncovers (more like it almost drops in his lap) a terrible secret about his grandfather; a secret involving conspiracy and murder. A murder plot that results in the founding of the town. A curse is being fulfilled this night, the one hundred year anniversary of the small town. There's something in the fog. It moves against the wind and seems to glow. Just what IS it?? This is a scary flick! I've seen it many times and still jump and squirm in spots! Watch it with Halloween on a cold, dark night. You'll chew your nails to nubs! The music is great as well. Carpenter has a way with simple, repetative, yet creepy as hell sounds. Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. And whatever you do, DON'T GO OUT IN THE FOG...

0451196716|2.0|I'm writing this as a counter-point to other reviews of \\"The long walk\\".  In many ways, this is typical King; if you like this author, you will probably like this book.  In other ways, King has written a truly transparent metaphor for the human condition. The story about a long walk in which you die if you stop walking suggests trite comparisons to our collective journey through life.  The ending of the book also conjures up a parallel with the inevitability of death; the winner of the Long Walk doesn't truly win, he dies like the rest of the contestants, much as all of us will ultimately die regardless of our walk through life. Overall, this is the \\"pulpy\\" King at his pulpy best, and the \\"philosophical\\" King at his philosophical worst.

0156027321|5.0|I have been an atheist for a long time. I've probably been an atheist for longer than Yann Martel has been alive and now, having read his  story, I still don't believe in God, nor will I ever. I do believe that great stories are being written into the 21st Century though and this is about the best one I've read so far.<br />On the surface it's a story about a boy in a lifeboat alone, but for a 450 pound Bengal Tiger. Beneath the surface it's about a boy who has suffered such loneliness and tragedy that his mind spared him the brunt of the pain of it by taking leave of him for awhile.<br />You'll read this book, put it down, read some other book, and then come back to this one to re-read the beginning, at least, to see what you might have missed the first time. All in all it's money very well spent.
B000002I2I|4.0|I think we can safely say that the debut was the best of the bunch. After that I think they're all equally good, just different. &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; starts out strong with the big hit &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, then goes to &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, (oddly enough not on the album of the same name). That is an excellent song. Both are on the &quot;Best of&quot;. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; is a great rocker, and slides right into the smooth &quot;Blue Sunday&quot;, almost sounding like one continuous track. That's sweet. Another favorite is the beautiful &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, where Jim sings &quot;IIIIII love you....the best, better than all....the rest&quot;. I imagine his girlfriend liked that one. All in all, &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; is just as essential as any other &quot;Doors&quot; album. I've always enjoyed my stay.
6304798482|4.0|Compaired to current sci-fi movies, this movie isn't a diety, that's why I didn't give it a five, but it really is a great movie to see. Cockroaches grow to enormous size and invade the subway systems in New York City. They develop the ability to walk amongst men as if they were men, of course NYC citizens don't really notice anything...being as they are New Yorkers... This movie is a great buy and I personally loved it. It had all the scientific classifications and explanations of how the roaches got to their present state...and action and suspense to back it up.<br />I Highly Recommend this Movie!!  It's ****1/2 stars....
B000001Y5D|4.0|I don't know why this is always in the used stores, because it's definitely a keeper to me. Though it was their only album, it's a great alterna-pop-rocker from 1992. What stands out even more than the great songs, is the voice of Linda Perry. She sings like her life depends on it, and has one of the most powerful voices I've ever heard. \\"What's Up\\" is the big single here, followed by \\"Spaceman\\", but my favorites are \\"Morphine and Chocolate\\" and \\"Dear Mr. President\\". Both excellent tracks. The only comparisons that come to mind are Concrete Blonde and Heart.....kind of. Linda Perry has gone on to be a successful producer, but I think that singing is obviously her strong point. She does have a solo album out, just don't look for it under the name \\"1 Non Blonde\\".
B00005ASOI|4.0|In 1977 SUSPIRIA was considered an extremely violent film; in the wake of the slasher genre, however, the violence involved seems less horrific than you might expect. What continues to work, however, is the look with which director Argento endows the film, particularly in regard to the set designs, camera set-ups, and use of color. Visually speaking, this is an amazingly beautiful film, with Art Nouveau designs, deceptively simple cinematography, and washes of intensely artificial color that dazzle with intensity. Even in the midst of its horrors it is almost impossible to take your eyes from the film, such is its strange beauty.<br />The cast is equally strange. Leads Jessica Harper and Stefania Casini are very typical of 1970s ingenues, but they each have a quality that sets them slightly apart from the young actresses of the time. Barbara Magnolfi makes an impression as Olga, one of the school's students, as does Susanna Javicoli as a harsh instructor. Even Udo Kier, cult star of Andy Warhol's FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA puts in an appearance. But oddest of all is Hollywood's Joan Bennett, who gives a truly flawless turn as the seemingly lady-like and ultra-respectable Madame Blanc.<br />Less successful is the story itself, which is so slight as to be almost incidental. Young dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has enrolled in a famous Italian ballet school--and upon her arrival finds another student fleeing the school in hysterics, a student who is not long after murdered in a horrifically brutal way. Odd incidents follow, and when Suzy's classmate and friend Sara (Stefania Casini) goes missing, Suzy begins to piece together the truth.<br />Another flaw, at least to my mind, is the soundtrack. While it has been widely admired, I can think of few film soundtracks that are quite as heavy-handed in their dynamics as SUSPIRIA. That aside, and while the film has considerable creepiness, it isn't frightening per se. In the final analysis, this is a film which I think is best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it. Recommended, but rent it first.<br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it.

B000059QYB|4.0|I remember so long having to make due with his remixed &quot;Vital Idol&quot; disc for a &quot;hits&quot; package. This is what I wish I had all that time. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but this is way more complete. 16 rebel tracks in all. &quot;White Wedding&quot;, &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, and &quot;Cradle of Love&quot; are the BIG hits, but it's &quot;Eye's Without a Face&quot;, &quot;To be a Lover&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; that make this totally awesome! It's hard to pick favorites though, these really are ALL classic songs from the blonde, punk Elvis. Included are the covers &quot;Don't you forget about me&quot;, and The Doors &quot;LA Woman&quot; from the &quot;Charmed Life&quot; album. I actually would have liked another track from that one. His newer &quot;Shock to the System&quot; is pretty good too. I would highly suggest getting this. You'll be &quot;dancing with yourself&quot; in no time.
B00008LDPU|2.0|I am a Matrix fan. I have been a Matrix fan but after seing this I can't say that I will \\"always be\\"  Matrix fan. This thing was pointless. It just lets you know how it all started. But to me that was part of the coolness the Matrix had to offer...the fact that you know little no knowlage. You just have to wait for the next movie to come out (Revolutions). I am highly dissapointed with Enter the Matrix as well. This coming from a Matrix fan who printed out flyers ins school and put them all around the hallways announcing the arrival of Matrix Reloaded, which I would give a three out of five. That is mostly because the begining [was not good], and then to top it off, the Wachowski brothers had a fadawy type camera shot of Keanue Reaves instead of Carrie Ann Moss which was [not good]. Most the people who watched the movie were guys! All in all, for nine stupid pointless, appetite losing (oh yeah, I lost my appatite eating some chicken Lo Mein dammit!)...Don't spend [the money]. It's not worth it. The only reason it gets 2 stars is beacuse I give them more credit than they desreve on the animation. I like the style they used though...It's new. Rent it. You might think I am a piece of crap for saying all this, so just keep in mind that is my opinion you are reading.
B000002B2T|4.0|Fact is, if this said &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; on the cover, I doubt anyone would really question it. It's similar to both their self-titled disc, and &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;. &quot;Layne Staley&quot; singing, with help from members of &quot;Screaming Trees&quot; and &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, put together this only offering from &quot;Mad Season&quot;, which rivals the great &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; in terms of grunge &quot;supergroups&quot;. Both groups had just one release, and both were excellent. There's a few riffy grungers on here which are good, but I enjoy the slower tracks more. &quot;River of Deceit&quot; was the single, and that song is so good, I can actually say it's beautiful. The songs &quot;Wake up&quot; and &quot;All Alone&quot; are also as good, and great ways to open and close the album. The artwork is also done by &quot;Layne&quot;. Any fan of AIC or grunge should check this out.
