B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Reading a love story from a man's point of view is quite special, especially when he can accurately anticipate the female perspective.  This story is about first love, lost love, and the twists and turns our lives inevitably take.  The characters in this book experience the feeling of true love for another person.  The selfless actions that put a loved one before yourself is a feeling that takes maturity and a complete and unchallenged desire for only good for that person regardless of your own seeds. True love.<br />This would be a great book for young adults. There should be some caution for easily influenced teens due to premarital relations,however the messages are wholesome.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Bryson is my fav author and I had read almost all of his other books. I was not a fan of Oz, never had a burning desire to travel there, and after reading this I'm not sure if I found it so fantastic that I DO want to go, or incomprehensable to get around to seeing it ALL! Bryson does a usual excellent job combing travel writing with historical references and definately opened my eyes to Aboriginal Sovialism at least! Great read, and I suggest combing it with google earth to get a feel of all the places he went

B000002N25|4.0|I am a die hard Mark Knopfler fan who has bought all of his albums starting with Sailing to Philadelphia up to Privateering, his newest release.  I then went back and bought this album.  At first, I was disappointed, but after a few listens, the album really grew on me.<br /><br />If I had to compare this album with Privateering, I would say that the guitar playing and songwriting are still top notch, but Knopfler's vocals have deepened, which I think is a good thing because his songs are stories rather than pop-like tunes with a catchy chorus.  His deeper-sounding vocals play better off of the lyrics, making it sound like he is storytelling.  That being said, did anyone else think that Mark's vocals on this album sometimes sounded weak, as if he were almost whispering?...either that or I sometimes had difficulty hearing his vocals over the instruments..maybe it was the fault of the mixing of the album in the studio.<br /><br />I also believe that Privateering demonstrates how Knopfler has taken advantage of surrounding himself with very talented musicians so that his guitar almost accompanies them rather than vice versa.  He does the same on this album (members of the Chieftains help out), but not to the same extent as he has on his later albums. Again, this was only his start.<br /><br />Here are some of the songs I liked best:<br /><br />Darling Pretty---strong hints of the softer rocking side of Dire Straits with the vintage Strat picking..supposedly written for Mark's wife<br /><br />A Night In Summer Long Ago--a wonderful celtic waltz that could easily be on a Chieftains album..a glimpse of the wonderful celtic sounds that would appear on so many of his future albums<br /><br />Cannibals--Knopfler plagiarizes himself by ripping off the melody of Walk of Life--great fun<br /><br />Je Suis Desole--Knopfler goes Cajun, with french lyrics too!<br /><br />Rudiger--a song about an autograph hound, allegedly loosely based on the murder of John Lennon..overall, the song has hints of a 60s bossa nova/Burt Bacharach type sound and a portion of the song, namely, the guitar instrumental in the middle, has a very film noir sound to it..this reminds me of a mellower version of \\"Hollywood Nocturne,\\" a song by Brian Setzer on his album \\"Dirty Boogie.\\"  Both guitarists like that deep, dark, tremolo guitar twang.<br /><br />If you don't have any Knopfler albums, you might as well start here, though I am more partial to his last 3 albums--Kill to Get Crimson, Get Lucky and Privateering.  In any event, the music is still wonderful and you won't be disappointed, unless you are seeking a straight carbon copy of Dire Straits..if that is the case, you will find hints and dashes of it, especially on a song like Cannibals, but otherwise, you can see that Knopfler was taking his core guitar playing and moving into other areas,thankfully so. If we can't have Dire Straits, at least be thankful we still have Mark Knopfler, hopefully, for a long time to come.<br /><br />Check out my reviews of his other albums if you are interested. Hope the reviews help.ng has hints of a 60s bossa nova/Burt Bacharach type sound and a portion of the song, namely, the guitar instrumental in the middle, has a very film noir sound to it..this reminds me of a mellower version of \\"Hollywood Nocturne,\\" a song by Brian Setzer on his album \\"Dirty Boogie.\\"  Both guitarists like that deep, dark, tremolo guitar twang.<br /><br />If you don't have any Knopfler albums, you might as well start here, though I am more partial to his last 3 albums--Kill to Get Crimson, Get Lucky and Privateering.

B003O86FMW|5.0|A stunning turn of events after book one.  I did not see it coming! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I could not stop until I was finished.  I took the confusing journey along wit Katniss, and was so involved in her emotions that I felt as if I had experienced everything she had.  The end of the book left me feeling distraught.  Moving straight on to the next one.  Do not mss reading this series.  It is worth the time and money, and then some! Excellent imagination Suzanne Collins. You are able to draw us into another world with words alone
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book honestly shows what highschool is like. You are finding your spot in all the chaos, I know because I'm still looking for mine.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|The book was a good read but I didn't love it like i did gone girl. I thought it was pretty predictable even the twist at the end. Worth reading.
0061726834|4.0|God I love this universe, but writing this review, I might be a little biased... I have also read Pandemonium (twice) at this point, and I am deep into Requiem. I would say that this is the worst book in the series. And that is pretty good news, because this book is indiscussibly incredible. I have recommended it to just about everyone (including and 11 year old, and my mom.) with good reason.<br />Oliver is one of my favorite writers, and though Delirium is not one of my favorite books, it is pretty damn close!<br />I want to give it five stars, I really do.. But the thing is, if I do that, what will make the sequel better? But it does deserve the five stars, Pandemonium just deserves them... More...<br />The ending of thing book is, summed up: A killer. I wanted to murder everyone who talked to me in the post 24 hours after finishing, and when Pandemonium finally arrived... I didn't dare to read it through, but if I didn't, I couldn't read anything else. It was like a constant nagging, itchy feeling under my skin, and well... I ended up devouring both.<br />So buy this.. Don't lent it on the library, because you WILL want to have it to yourself. and DON'T wait to order Pandemonium, because the wait WILL kill you.<br />The characters are real, the concept is horrifying (and also all too real.) and the storyline is good, all building up to the last 50 pages of reader-killing suspense.<br />But don't mistake the upbuilding for boredom, because you won't even know 'till the book is well over.<br />Praise to Lauren Oliver, and all my love to the Delirium trilogy!

006197806X|5.0|YES! Yes, yes, yes! Finally a sequel better than the first! There is only one thing I don't like about this book. The ending. Not because the writing lacks, or the drama is too much or not enough. No, I hate this ending, because it has devastated my ability to think of anything but Lena, Julian, Alex.<br />Is Alex dead? I don't know. The answer is obvious, and yet I don't really know for sure.<br />But one thing is crystal clear; Nothing will be simple in Requiem (which I am reading right now)<br />I waited a half year for that last book, while thinking, hoping, and wondering if it will fold out the way I want it to. Probably not.. But I'm still allowed to hope.<br />As usual, Oliver's writing is flawless, emotional and believable. Lena is partly going crazy, partly learning to breathe as the book unfolds in chapters of 'Then' and 'Now'.<br />This book has tons of layers, and I love it. It makes me think, laugh, cry and FEEL.<br />I fully recommend this to anyone with a beating heart!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I purchased this app thinking it would allow me to watch a few news programs, and maybe even follow a shopping channel or two, but it does neither.  The HSN stream never changes, and the TV stations either don't play, or are so outdated they are useless.<br />I would not recommned this app to ANYONE!!  Purely a waste of time and money!!<br />If you had a zero stars option, it would be too high a choice for this app.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was released just days before Chris Kyle n Chris Littlefield were gunned down near their homes by another soldier who they were trying to help adjust to living a civilian life.  This book is a look at war that has never been captured before.  Chris Kyle guarded his &#34;brothers in arms&#34;  through the crosshairs of a sniper rifle.  He could see WHO he was killing.  He was not dropping bombs on faceless targets.  Yet he knew if he did not kill each of his targets thousands of Americans would be killed.  He KNEW if he didn't do his job American military n civilians would be murdered with IEDs, car bombs, martyrs.  Chris Kyle LOVED n CARED whether he was in battle or home. I would have loved to have known this man.  He was real, struggled with his own demons, n loved deeply.  You will be a better person for reading this story.

B00181JGI2|3.0|very entertaining but it has more complexity then necessary to create an effect or make a point.<br />Some characters should be more defined and connected to the overall story in the movie.<br />Acting reinforces the spirit of the movie.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Just as I remember it as a young girl.  Story was so beautiful.  Music was just enough.<br />Characters were heartfelt and warm and wonderful.  Everyone should see this story.<br />Makes you wonder what ever happened to love and honor now a days.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I wouldn't have rated it with ANY stars but it wouldn't let me do that plus write something.  Don't waste your time or your money, whether it's hard earned or not, on this boring, perversion and poor attempt to 'tell' a story.  I don't even know why they bothered....oh wait, yes I do. To make a buck.  Seriously disappointed. The only recommendation I would have to anyone, other than to the public to NOT bothering to watch it, is for the director/producers, whoever, that made this movie.....I don't care to see a perverted sex fiend for two hours. That's not my idea of a fun time.

B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie is eye candy and not much else. It was slow and predictable. Sadly I found that the little bit of enjoyment I found in it; mostly during the dance scenes, was no where near enough to make the movie likable or watchable again.

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Everyone, Jimi Hendrix died in 1970. The man had an absolutely mind staggering amount of material but alas, it's 2013. 43 years. We've heard everything. This album is pretty damn good and flows great. It also features versions of songs I've never heard before. There's no secret vault that Experience Hendrix is hiding away. It's kind of lame they issued tracks on this one that were on Valleys of Neptune, and yeah we've heard them before. I'll tell you though, I liked it. If you're a Hendrix fan and haven't spent hours upon hours digging for his unreleased material, you'll like this. I have 20 gigs of Hendrix but get bored digging through it, so to me it was nice to buy something like this (mind you it's a compilation more than a studio album, obviously) that essentially 'filters throuh the rough'. This is good listening material and you're a fool if you thought it was gonna be brand new tracks. Jimi was the guitar master but he hadn't quite yet learned to sonically manipulate time. Maybe if he had a few more years, but unfortunately, he didn't.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An enticing story!  I cannot wait for more!  There are so many different mini-plots within this show that it always pleases!
B003EY62II|5.0|I love this movie. The two that were made are so entertaining for kids and big kids like me who are in our 40's.  It was nice to see Sarah Michelle Gellar in a role that wasn't Buffy. She plays quirky very well, as does Freddie Prinze, Jr.  The rest of the cast were great, too, I just can't think of their names right now. But still, awesome. And an all around feel good movie. Have they made a Scooby-Doo 3 yet?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game.  I really like it.<br /><br />I really like this game. I love it. It is really fun. I could stay up all night playing it.
B009EE5SQ4|5.0|This is a great movie.  My son and I have watched it dozens of times and never get tired of it.  The special effects are great!  The actors are superb.  The theme of the story really causes you to wonder if this could really happen.  After all, it is a BIG universe!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|Downton Abbey: Seasons 1-3. (2010-2012). 3 sets of 3 DVDs. Written by Julian Fellows.<br />Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery, Jessica Brown Findlay, Laura Carmichael, Dan Stevens, Penelope Wilton, Allen Leech, Maggie Smith, Shirley MacLaine, Jim Carter, Phyllis Logan, Leslie Nicol, Brendan Coyle, Joanne Froggatt, Siobhan Finneran, Rob James-Collier, Sophie McShera, others.<br /><br />I bought the DVDs for seasons 1-3 of Downton Abbey as a birthday present for my wife, and what a great present they were! We finished watching season 3 a couple of days ago, ran through all the ancillary features -\\"The Making of This,\\" \\"The Making of That,\\" etc., and sat there feeling like we'd lost family, at least until season 4 appears.<br /><br />So the starting point of his review is simply to say what a wonderful experience it is to watch this series unfold across time, from 1914 to (now) 1920? 21? 22? I'm not sure exactly when series 3 ends but it's very early in the 20s, at the start of a formative decade that shook social and behavioral patterns in the western world.<br /><br />What is so excellent about Downton Abbey? I'm tempted to start with the actors, who are superb, but I won't. It's the feeling of time, place and caste that makes this series superior. There's a downstairs world and an upstairs world. They frequently cross but the lower world never supersedes the upper one. It's a mini-history of the twentieth century, where, after the Great War ended, the rules kept changing, always in favor of flexibility, at least until the late 30s. Lady Sybil (is she daughter 2 or daughter 3 of the Grantham line?) elopes with the chauffeur, who is, on top of all his other social solecisms, an Irish nationalist. Lady Edith seems to be ending up in a non-marriage relationship with a modern man who can't divorce his wife because, with her mad, she can't be proved blameful. Everyone, even the most conservative (Robert, Earl of Grantham, Lady Violet, his imperious but wised and always snippy mother), must bend to the winds of change. So one reason to love Downton Abbey is that it captures in an extraordinarily prescient fashion the dramatic (and thus exciting) changes that were tasking place in English society in the early Twenties.<br /><br />There is too the visual sweep of the series. Downton Abbey, a real place but not the Granthams' place, is (pick one or more) 1. Impressive, 2. Beautiful, 3. Representative of a Time Long Past But Worth Remembering. The producers of the series have not stinted in making this series visually beautiful, from costumes (oh my God! The dresses countess Grantham [Elizabeth McGovern], Lady Violet [Maggie Smith], and Ladies Mary, Sybil, and Edith wear!  And the men's outfits, in an age before Shoddy Chic became fashionable. If you were to make a Dream World in which you could dress, act and feel, this would probably be it.<br /><br />So finally we get to script and acting. Julian Fellowes wrote the script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park (2001), a film that has echoes to this series. Between Fellowes, who knows this world from the inside, and the historical advisor for the series, whose name I forget but who is VERY good!, this series is, to use English outdated slang, \\"spot on.\\" The story line may exaggerate at moments but whatever happens in this series, upstairs or downstairs, is historically right on the mark. IT shows how much we like peeking in on a world that actually existed.<br /><br />Acting? I may have missed someone, but I counted 49 characters in this complicated, multi-year drama who have at least one scene, and lines to deliver. In short, 49 people who are not ciphers, extras, standard bearers, but are instead real people.<br /><br />I've directed plays. I even, one time, directed a drama with fifty actors in it. (The Insect Comedy, by Karel and Josef Capek.) If you haven't done a drama of that scope, you have no idea how difficult it is to do! Take it for granted that the principal actors, upstairs and downstairs, are good. But 49 characters! The mind boggles.<br /><br />I like also that the characters are not uni-dimensional.  It's easier to see with the series  Bad Guys, of whom there are three -no, four, if you include the Press Baron whom Lady Mary almost marries in series 2.<br /><br />There's Lady Edith, the resentful `ugly duckling' sister, who, in season 1, betrays Lady Mary's shameful secret. But by season 3, you admire her. She refuses to be a cipher, an all to common ending for aristocratic ladies of the late teens and early twenties. She's been jilted at the altar and you feel for her.  She seems on her way to be self-directed professional lady leading an unconventional life of affection. Hurrah for Lady Edith! You certainly don't feel animosity towards her.<br /><br />The two for a while resolutely malevolent Bad Guys in the servants' quarters are O'Brien, Lady Cora's dresser, and Thomas, eventually, it seems, an under-butler, but other roles en route. O'Brien is your conventional malcontent but at a crucial moment she says to herself, \\"No, I'm not as bad as that,\\" and she has, underneath her resentment, a real loyalty to Lady Cora, a bond of affection I'm not sure she even realizes. As to Thomas, he's so evil and Machiavellian that when Shirley MacLaine arrived to join in on the third season, when she saw him, she said, \\"Oh, you're the evil one!\\" Bu he sobs his heart out when something wrenchingly bad happens to one of the members of the Grantham clan in series 2 (Anna, throughout a Good Guy among the servants, puts her hand around him, and if Anna vouches for him, even for a moment , so will I!) and his plight at the end of the last episode in season 3 leaves you think that his malignity isn't so much his fault as his situation.<br /><br />Is the series always realistic? No. What happens to its characters is sometimes -often--exaggerated. But who cares? This is a wonderfully acted, written, staged and costumed series about major issues in modern life., and when you're done with it, the players in this gripping drama feel like your neighbors and relatives.ctors, upstairs and downstairs, are good.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very well written. This book has the usual draw to suck you into the story but then it goes beyond that. It gives great insight into the division in Germany during the rise of the Nazi party and how many people were fighting for country and not party. If you enjoy WWII books this one will not disappoint. I couldn't put it down.
B0084RSYEK|5.0|I love to see how Eddie Murphy has grown over the years. He says it's due to having kids that he began doing more things that were toned down. Thank you, Mr. Murphy.  This movie is done in a new way (as far as I can tell I've never seen a movie about redemption and change like this before).  And Eddie is hilarious as usual. See for yourself! You won't be disappointed.
B000KIPT30|5.0|This thing works great.  I was using a headpone splitter cable to run 2 different model of Sennheiser headphones simultaneously.  Splitters stink because the volume will be different in each headphone if they aren' t the same model, each listener can't change volume independently, and you can hear when the other person bumps their headphone.  This headphone amp is a zillion times better solution for 2 to 4 headphones.  Independent volume control and very clean sound.  If you get distortion, it is most likely from sending the input signal too high.  Lower the input signal!  The amp can really jack the volume, to dangerous levels in fact.  The sound is rich and full, I'm really happy using this amp instead of that awful splitter cable.  I threw the splitter away so no one uses it thinking it will be a good idea.<br /><br />This ships with NO AUDIO CABLES!  I'm glad I looked at the &#34;what people purchased with&#34; to see that the 10'  male to male cable is often ordered with the amp.  I was able to use it right out of the box instead of hunting for yet more cables.  So remember to order a male to male headphone cable (large size, 1/4 inch, or 6.3mm).  10' is nice because the power cord is about 10' long so it's a good match.<br /><br />In my setup (my living room, Sony A/V receiver headphone jack, to Sennheiser HD555 and HD518 headphones) there is no buzz or distortion.

B00BNYCFNM|5.0|Amazing just how much Big Big Train have transformed into one of the world’s top Prog Rock groups since their masterpiece “The Underfall Yard”.  They matched that great LP with “English Electric (Part One)” and possibly have outdone themselves with “English Electric (Part Two)”.  True they will remind every listener of Genesis in both their sound and vocals, but Big Big Train are simply even more fantastic sounding than Genesis ever was, and I love the Genesis sound (the Steve Hackett era of course).<br />I really believe this will be one of the best Prog Rock albums of 2013, up there with Steven Wilson, again proving that Big Big Train has officially matured as a great Prog Rock group.  The music on the LP is easy listening Symphonic Prog with incredible vocals and a vast array of instrumentation that is nothing short of spectacular.  It’s a lush and beautiful release from Big Big Train.<br />No doubt that the addition of David Longdon on vocals and Nick D'Virgilio on drums since the “Underfall Yard” LP have brought this band from an interesting but faulty prog-explorer to a great sounding mature prog-rock powerhouse!  Outstanding songwriting skills, beautifully and gorgeously crafted songs that hit the right spots.  One highlight of that on this LP is the closing song “Curator of Butterflies”.  Every song hits the mark on this LP. Gone is the day of messy over-blown songs from Big Big Train and hello to perfectly structured and well-balanced music that is golden to the ears.  I’m sure they wish they hit this classic peak earlier in their history, but plenty of years remain for some more outstanding classic Big Big Train releases if they keep this magical band lineup together.

B000JLQSW4|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite albums. I still hear a couple of the songs being played as background music at some retail stores. Great songs.
B004047XXO|1.0|That's not what 3-D is about. They give you the old green and red paper glasses with it. It's the worse thing I have ever seen. Don't waste your money. I actually wound up throwing it out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I finally jumped on board the Downton Abbey train and absolutely loved it! As a member of Amazon Prime, I was able to watch the whole season for free. Well acted and engaging show!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great read!  The main character fascinated me and the storyline twisted and turned constantly, keeping the book in a roller coaster ride to the end.  It took me several pages to get into the story, but once I was hooked, I was hooked!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have many boards. Like things to do in the garden and house also love the recipe's I find. Also follow and have a lot of fun followers.
B0016CBHXA|5.0|The item was shipped quickly and was in great condition when it got here.  The movie itself is my favorite installment of the Indiana Jones movies.  Sean Connery's character was absolutely hilarious.  He was serious, but unintentionally condescending towards his son, who we had all previously seen as this great adventurer and hero.  He was sort of the bumbling idiot in a world of fast action, danger, and espionage....quite the departure from being a quiet professor.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This group really surprised me. Excellent vocals, melodies and arrangements. Give them a serious listen and maybe you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Now here is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. They did a great job on this movie, and it was so interesting to see how this all went down.
B000FC1MCS|1.0|complete waste of time. I didn't quit because thought something would happen to give more meaning. Silly attempt to focus on troubled young man's perspective
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The chapters are a mix of short and long the story is very touching made me cry it changes my point of view of all animals
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Good plot twists and a sense of screwball comedy, not something very many sci-fi authors can write. Bujold takes the reader for an interesting ride. A good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the classic addictive card game.  When you have down time and nothing to do this is a great game to play.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|As with their other album I reviewed, this too is an excellent album. Very smart with lyrics and musical arrangements. Enjoy!!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|When I first saw a preview for Arthur Christmas I thought it looked pretty stupid. After being dragged to see it I was pleasantly surprised. It's not your usual &#34;Christmas is ruined and we have to fix it!&#34; stories. All of the kids in the world receive their presents from millions of Santa's elves in Santa's high tech airship, except for one who was missed, which is where the whole storyline starts. Young Arthur has to prove to his father, Santa, that he is worthy enough to become the next Santa. The plot is very exciting the entire way through and at no moment did it drag. Kids and adults will like every bit of this movie, especially since it doesn't really throw the sappy Christmas stuff at you like every other Christmas movie. Definitely a must have for any avid movie-goer or Christmas lover.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|It was as good as Downton Abbey.  Good color, storyline,likable characters,outside shots were nice.  Am anxious to watch season 2.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I bought this for my Sci/fi colection and to make up for the Alien- Predator Total Distruction Collection, so I am happy with my movies.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I lost the last one of these adapters; this was a replacements.  I've used this adapter/dongle in the past and have always been pleased with construction and performance.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It's similar to solitaire, and just as addictive.  Myself and my children love this game, and I love that I can play it on my kindle when taking a long road trip.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed playing the game. Great graphics. Long game. Well worth the money. If you like hidden object games this is for you.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Every song on here definitely deserves the title &#34;very best&#34;. Can only think of a couple more songs I might add to this list.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Really a great game. The graphics may not be the best I've ever seen. But the game is such a refreshing change from most of the games out there. Worth the money for me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|there is sex.... then there is bad piggies.... top two things for someone to have... highly recommended... cop asap yo
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm not really into it. My grown daughter, who shoots a lot of photos of my grandson, started me on it to save confusion over who got the photos and eliminated the need forward everything. The rest of our extended family and close friends all use it, so I guess I have it as self-defense.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I used this primarily for World of Warcraft, so comfort and ease of use is important, especially when playing for hours. Wish I bought this years ago.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|It is a lot of fun to play.  My kids even enjoyed it.  I think watching and playing gives you an idea of force and using brakes and speed.
1844488748|5.0|This Di Van Niekerk's Roses in Silk and Organza Ribbon instruction book is so easy to follow.  The number and variety of flowers is impressive and fun to learn to do.  Seller is wonderful to do business with.  I would happily buy again from them.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like solitaire you will also like this game, you can play a winning deal and win every time or play a random deal and take your changes
B005K17RU0|3.0|Not all info. I'd like but enough to get by maybe by moving pictures of the weather I would have liked better.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|This was an interesting read. I was in marketing for a number of years, and have been a success story at Weight Watchers. How habits are formed, routines changed, and why we buy things were inc included in this book.
B005RZ8W94|5.0|Great DVD for anyone who likes Volbeat.  Some of footage is in danish, but you can always turn on subtitles.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Holy cow just when you thought it couldn't get any more weird;Pendergast has a son let alone two. Wives,Nazis,and Twins Oh My. This was a heck of a new storyline. We no longer have Diogenes so now we get a ruthless, disfigured, young highly trained killer who will go on it seems to carry on the murderous Pendergast legacy for a long time to come. Alban and Tristram are introduced and we find out more about Constance' s past as well as having a few questions answered from a couple of books ago. Can't wait to see what comes next. Keep up the good work gentlemen.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Maybe it is because of all the hype about what a great movie this is, but I didn't think it was very good. The story is way to complicated for a 2 hour movie, and it seemed like they had a list of 5 moments/events that they wanted to cover, all of which included some cliff hanger we-are-going-to-get-caught moment.<br /><br />It is an amazing story in real life, but it just didn't translate into a good movie for me.
6305090564|4.0|Pretty good monster movie with plenty of action and a bit of gore.  The CG actually holds up pretty well and doesn't look too horrible compared to more recent special effects.  The plot is a bit predictable, but thats not why we watch these kinds of movies now is it?
B003FSTN52|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows on tv today. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and I love every minute!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and kind of burned out at one point because they no longer held the impact of his earlier novels. He added so many twists with this one that the reader didn't really know what was going on until late in the read.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I will lose count of how many times I re-read this book. It cuts to, then straight through the bone on issues we ALL face which hold us back from accomplishing the most important thing in our lives at any point, at any scale, which is _______ (insert your passion here). Do not read this book if you're fine with status quo (nothing wrong with that). Read this book to understand how to overcome the opposing forces facing you today, or the ones waiting to greet you the moment you start working on _______.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I use in everything and you don't drink water and nothing  when you turn  freestyle you can do it with that  and the style to really work !!!!
0307957837|5.0|I remember reading the Golden Compass in elementary school and loving it so it was great to revisit it plus the sequels all in one package. I actually got in trouble for reading the book at school because it was a christian school and this book had been placed on the ban list. Luckily I was a nerd, a huge reader, and became great friends with the librarian and her daughter so she would pass books on to me that she thought were good including the Golden Compass after it was banned. She also lent me a little book I had never heard of called Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone she had imported from England but made me promise not to tell where or who I had gotten it from because she could get in trouble from the school. I kind of feel like a hipster about Harry Potter now because, yeah, I read the book before he was popular. j/k but it was still really cool to read it and then when it was released in America it became popular as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|You can't put emotes in with any regularty or ease, each part of the page needs to be investigated seperately..... There is no way to multi task. However you are able to access it away from your computer (assuming the wi-fi you access will allow you)....
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a great app.  It makes exploring the wide range of TED talks easy and convenient.  And, TED talks themselves are generally terrific -- small doses of thought-provoking or funny or just profoundly interesting video.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I'm so happy to have seen the trailer for your movie and realized I had bought these books on my Kindle and never got a chance to read them. So I finished what I was reading and jumped right in with both feet. I can't tell you both how excited I did. I'm impressed with your humor and story lines, twists a nd turns and suspense through out these books. I love that they truly are just special teens and not jumping into each others pants. Young Adult books should be just that, for young adults, period. I'm so happy for your success and so look forward to seeing Beautiful Creatures on film!! Keep up the great work girls!!! Love it!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't care for fantasy science fiction.  I want a good story based on what may be or at least have the potential to become fact, e.g. everything AC Clarke wrote.  Andy Weir has written probably the hardest science fiction story that I've ever read.  In fact, it may be too fact and detailed for some, but I loved it.  Weir also has good sense of humor, inserting language and dialogue that is believable.<br /><br />Becoming the first accidental long term resident of Mars is no walk in the park.
B008D37J6O|3.0|The HD player works just fine but the one drawback is that there is no volume control. Maybe there will be an update to fix that problem.
0553801473|5.0|I love a Song of Ice and Fire but this book was a little slow and it did not seem like much happened compared to other books in the series. The wait time between books is also a killer because who knows when he will finish them.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I have been in IT work for 13 years and I use many of the debugging techniques featured in this book. It is all plausible and that is what scares me the most. Everyone involved in network security should read this book. Consider this a warning! With that said, I rather enjoyed it. :-)

B0067EKY9K|5.0|I did not kow what to expect but it is one of my new favorites!  I wish that they expanded more on the ending of the movie just a little bit.  I wanted to see more! I have ordered the book to get more details of the story.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|fun but you lose lives at an alarming rate.  the adds get old but you get what you pay for sometimes.  fun and not so involved that you cant play a quick game waiting for the shop to finish changing the oil in your car.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Potential to be addictive - ideas: ability to uncheck accidental selections, progressive levels.  Choice of cube textures/designs would disguise repetition.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I hardly play console games anymore but this came up for a great price and since I had heard so many rave reviews about flower and journey, I thought I would give it a shot. Journey took a little while for me to get into but after that I was hooked. One thing I did not particularly care for though was that even though it is a physical disk you still have to install the games to your hard drive which can take a little while.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|If you enjoy match 3 games this is a good one to get. Works beautifully on my Kindle Fire! Well worth the price...
B003IWRE3I|4.0|I'm not really sure how to rate it. This is the most convincing, human, gritty and \\"real\\" depressing fictional film I've ever seen. It's genuinely horrifying, even though the gore/horror only appears once, technically, and only for a brief moment. I don't think this movie will ever, ever \\"leave\\" me. (I's also a pretty unique case of the understated gore/horror being more horrifying than graphic depictions.)<br /><br />It makes the historical accounts of widespread, starvation-induced cannibalism seem almost understandable, in a realistic (yet still deplorable) way. I'm not sure I wanted to understand that, and this movie actually exceeds the real historic accounts of cannibalism within a scenario that humans have never yet experienced, to my knowledge (global loss of things to eat, besides other people.)<br /><br />Maybe \\"we\\" need the scenario laid out in this bare sort of detail. Or maybe films like this are best left as hypothetical? I don't know. I do know the movie was more like some sort of \\"documentary of the hypothetical\\" than a film depicting fiction. Similar situations have actually happened before, even if not on such a global scale.<br /><br />How to rate a movie like this? 5 stars or one? I don't know. I'm going with 4, because the movie is incredibly effective and moving. Its downfall is a failure to...do anything besides depress, I guess. 4 stars ain't bad, either.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game do those with nothing  to do. It  is  a good time as I always  play it on car journeys also when I am bored.
1401938906|4.0|The book E2 Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments that Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality by Pam Grout is an entertaining way to take your interest in the law of attraction to the next level. Pam tells us that it's not enough just to believe the law of attraction works. We need to know it works by proving it to ourselves.  To do that, she introduces us to 9 energy principles with an experiment to go along with each of them. She says you can prove to yourself once and for all, what you think, you create.<br /><br />This is no boring quantum physics manual. Pam is an entertaining writer, keeping the reader's interest, making them laugh while they learn.<br /><br />Pam says her book is about a \\"space heater\\" or an \\"invisible energy source.\\" She claims this 'space heater' is 100% reliable. She says, \\"It works every time like a set of math principles or law of physics. Two plus two always equals four. Balls dropped off roofs always fall. Your every thought always affects physical reality.\\"<br /><br />Pam challenges the reader to know this 'space heater' type energy exists by experimenting with it on their own. Most of these experiments are expected to produce results within 48 hours or less with little cost.<br /><br />I Explored Beyond the Usual and tried most of the experiments myself. I was surprised to find one of them worked within minutes. Here are the results of my tests:<br /><br />The Abracadabra Principle: Failed<br />The Dude Abides Principle: Took a little longer than 48 hours but did work<br />The Volkswagon Jetta Principle: This test not only worked with what I wrote down to manifest, it worked with what she wrote down to manifest-- sunsets beige cars and butterflies. I had crossed out her manifestation selections and wrote in my own. I manifested both selections within 24 hours (within minutes really).<br />The Alby Einstein Principle: Passed (see photo with dowsing rods)<br />The Dear Abby Principle: Undetermined. No noticeable response to the question asked.<br />The 101 Dalmations Principle: Failed<br /><br />So, a mixed bag really. I loved reading the book. Pam Grout is a great storyteller. Her writing is top notch and entertaining. It's a great way to learn how energy works in our lives. I would recommend the book to those who want to take their interest and knowledge of the law of attraction to the next level and start working with the concept is a structured but fun way.<br /><br />Disclosure: I am a Hay House Book Reviewer which means I may receive a book free of charge for review.

B00B8PRDHE|5.0|SWEET! I happen to live in Nashville and before this show at the historic Ryman Auditorium, Ringo was at the downtown Nashville Hard Rock cafe to celebrate his birthday and do his annual \\"Peace & Love\\" wish for the world. Extra cool because it just happens to be my birthday as well. (Oh, and I'm a drummer too). I filmed the whole event and edited it down to this 4:32 video, which includes a spontaneous rendition of \\"Give Peace A Chance\\". Also, I was holding up a sign that said \\"It's My Birthday Too, YEAH!\\" Ringo pointed, read the sign aloud... and wished ME a \\"Happy Birthday, Brother!\\"!! And it's all on video.  [...]  While I did not get a ticket for the show, I was honored to sit in the production truck during the filming and got to watch Ringo sing \\"Boys\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" on the multi-angle monitor. Certainly one of the coolest birthdays I ever had! Bloody-hell, a BEATLE wished ME a happy birthday!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I really liked the second season but as a person who has read all the books a couple parts really pissed me off where they left out entire MAIN characters like the Reed children and I wont spoil it for you but something that never took place in Quarth. I don't have HBO so I just wait for the series to come out but I remembered way back when the second series was premiering on HBO and my hairstylist said something about what happens to the mother of dragons in Quarth and I thought she was joking because that never happened in the books.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Recommend it very funny but stupid that is what made funny<br /> The price is expensive wish it was amazon prime
B004APVI1G|5.0|A beautiful movie!  Bought it for my 3-year old, and he likes it, but I like it more...which is okay, cause I get tired of watching Mighty Machines all the time!
B0089XH38M|4.0|This app was highly recommended by a friend to protect my android and so far I'm satisfied with it, it seems to be doing the job.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|Great casting, cinematography, and special effects made this series one of my favorite television series of all time. I read all the books last summer and was waiting to finish them all before I watched the series. I'm glad I did because the TV series only touches the full plot of the book and leaves it TONS of information. If you are at all interested in this TV series I highly recommend picking up the books. They are long but easy reading and once you get into them they are hard to put down. I spent many weekends last summer doing nothing but laying outside reading the day away getting lost in this fantastic world Martin created.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great historical piece, costumes, actors, a view into high English living.  All ages love this series- my 24 year old daughter to my 85 year old mother and their friends
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much better than Temple Run!!!  GET IT.  Don't think about it any longer. GET IT NOW.  You wont regret it, I promise!
B006H5120E|5.0|This movie was great in the 90's and is even better when viewed in 3D!  My husband never saw this movie (Can you believe that??) so when I bought this to watch on our 3D TV, he was skeptical.  We BOTH loved it!  The 3D adds so much to the movie.  Like other reviewers said, there are some parts where the 3D in the background isn't clear or not even there.  Look past that, and you'll be fine.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Great storyline with an excellent cast of characters. A great movie to watch when trying to curb your spring fever.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|We bought this for our grand daughter.  She absolutely loves it and it became an instant member of her Spongebob toy collection!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Did not like the way they ended it. Was a disappointment. Could have been better. The other  2 books ended better.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|it was going to be more of a mystery.  There was a twist in the story line  but some things just didn't make sense to me
1400064287|5.0|Excellent book for teachers, marketers, public relation/speakers. A lot of successful examples and histories, great work from the authors. And the design is really amazing!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I have seen this movie a bunch of times...maybe 25 or so times, usually around Thanksgiving, on cable.  BUY THE BLU RAY! The colours are so vivid!

0425252868|5.0|This is truly a classic book. It held my complete attention.<br />I recieved the book in record time and for a great price.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed the time travel and the historical aspects of the story.  The book is long, but since I didn't want to put it down, it turned into a quick read!  I'm a little confused by the dates and city listed at the very end of the story.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|he has created an interesting world with good stories running through time and linked to each other. I do want to see where this all goes.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|wow<br />brilliant read<br />factual, thought provoking, disturbing on a factual basis<br />great read!<br />could not put it down at all
B008OOYALE|4.0|I am only on level 12 but so far I am really enjoying the game. I love breeding my dragons and waiting to see what the new dragon will be. I wish u could purchase more evolution temples and breeding grounds. I also think the price is a bit steep for removing foliage and clearing land. Growing food also seems to take a long time for a little reward. The menus are also very clumsy. I like how in restaurant story you can view your news feed from anywhere but in dragon story you have to return home to view your news feed. This is annoying and results in me not returning visits.<br />Overall I enjoy the game for the concepts, challenges and cute factor. I just wish the issues stated above could be improved.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|As a LONG time Eddie Vedder/Pearl Jam fan, I had to buy the movie, Into the Wild. LOVED it! So of course, the soundtrack had to be purchased. It's great. It's Eddie. What more could you ask for?
1616550414|5.0|As a HUGE zelda fan I couldn't wait to get this, and it did not disappoint.  The book itself is sturdy, and beautiful.  It just looks great lying around the house.  As for the content, there is more than you can imagine.  It goes from why the milk maid had 3 buttons on her shirt, to realizing the time stone and the ocorina are made of the same material.  The book is laid out like textbooks from school, but you won't hate reading this one.  If you're a zelda fan then this is a must have.  I've been playing zelda since the original was released on Nintendo, so I was going to buy this no matter what, but luckily it is an excellent book, and very much worth the price.
B004YHD2XC|5.0|This was shipped promptly and arrived undamaged. This is a good quality version that is able to be played in my region (as I have heard of other's having difficulty with particular versions.
B001MTENOC|5.0|First off, if you do not have any interest in metaphysics, or spirituality outside of the social &#34;norm&#34; , or if you think the idea of reincarnation is insane you will hate this book and write if off as new age hippie dippy crap. If on the otherhand you do have an interest in these kinds of things or at least an open mind about them this book will blow you away. I intended to read a couple chapters of it before bed when I bought it and ended up reading it cover to cover until the sun came up. I could not put it down. What I found fascinating was that in all his case studies people were reporting the exact same things with no prior knowledge of the statements of others, and despite having different life experiences, religious beliefs, socioeconomic backgrounds etc. They all described the same things. Now obviously many people are going to have a hard time accepting even the remote possibility that anything in this book is true. Regardless of if it is or isn't , it makes you think. My brain felt like it had been cracked wide open. It gave me a lot to contemplate and opened up a new possibility for me to explore  on my quest to discover the answers to life, the universe and everything. I loved it and the experience of reading it was almost awe inspiring. As to the validity of its contents I'll allow you to draw your own conclusions.

B00A4OALL0|5.0|It's live! Very good pieces with Wayne on his best !<br />From second 1, Wayne and his jazzmates pull us in.<br />A fat piano, very close to the ear, starts rolling, one by one the players step in and there they go..!<br />The bass, snares of the piano, drum/perc. a horn, moving forward into concentrated &aacute;nd pleasurefull, kinda insuring, Real Jazz.<br />It's the typical tone and sound of Wayne.. Heard it first time on 'Weather Report&#34; ( that first full-energy-recording of the famous group with that same name; still a Monster in Good!)  And now this is where it went..;<br />Good Deep Digging. The piano sounds a bit fat and wiggly, an instrument that played jazz in countless times, love that! ( Or was it deliberately tuned like this.. Sound reminded me a bit of a recording from African Pianist Paul Winmer, who never came trough, but such a good feel!)<br />It adds something like an idea of being in a roomconcert, feels close.<br />Fine Bass! The Nrs. 6 and 7 are where it all comes together. 23+ minutes followed by 12+ min. of pure live-joy. A life of playing and here is the result ! Thank You !<br />Cool spheres. He still has that specific cry-out. Without a net indeed, moving trough the sky in complete confidence. A concert like recorded and played here on this CD was given last year on the North Sea jazz festival in Rotterdam (NL). To me that was the highlight of the Festival. Now they do  it again, on CD..!<br />Ah, and by the way.. Value for money; it is a long CD, near 72min. + !

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a crazy mystery. I would stay up for hours on end just to finish a chapter. I did not love the ending but I guess it did have to end. Great book!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I find myself quoting Katy Perry when talking to my kids. Be the best you;)  she is an amazing artist and a role model.
B00BCWOFIS|5.0|I fell in love with Gabriel Macht's acting in A Love Song for Bobby Long. He has great energy and when I saw that he was in this series I knew I HAD to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I have become so in love with this show... words can't even describe. I love the characters portrayed and the actors/actresses they found to work together, just awesome. What I wouldn't give to be at the shooting of one of these episodes!!! I love that Gabriel and his long time friend Sarah were able to work together on this... I feel that relationship adds more to the show. The banter and jokes that go back and forth are so well performed and written, that you honestly feel like a fly on the wall in the office. Really a job very well done by all!! Thank you and please continue with the great, great show! -- Mary Dunn
B008OOYALE|5.0|:) Get this game it is awesome good for all ages. I have three dragons so far. I hope to get more.<br /><br />  In the game you can decorate and fill your island with signs flowers dragons and more.<br /><br />Fuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|The lead up in this story was great.  Edge of your seat, don't put it down kind of thing.  But the end was soooooooo flat.  A killer who could not be stopped, wiping out everyone in his way; who just gives up due to a look in another's eye?  Please.
B00BHMF578|1.0|I loved the theme of the movie.  What I hated is that I had to stop and redo again and again.  The sound was awfull, and I coudn't understand anything.  At last, after redoing again and again, I finally saw the movie in full.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was spellbound from the get-go. On the same level as the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for me, as far as a real page turner. I look forward to Dark Places and Sharp Objects.
0525478817|5.0|Whether you have had someone die in your family from cancer or seen someone suffer from the terrible disease is not relevant at all as to how you will feel about this book. Sure, you will see the suffering but it won't envelope the book.<br /><br />If you can learn one thing from this entire book, please let it be the fact that we are ALL living with a terminal disease. Let's face it. One day each of us will die. Being able to swallow this truth will let you live a richer live and help you realize that what we truly want is a geniune human relationship. Hazel and Augustus have got that nailed down.
B00009NQQO|4.0|daughter loves playing with this in the tub, she doesn't want to get out of the tub now, its great
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Every episode is so exciting! I can't wait to get to the next one when one is over. I love the character s!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just when you think you've figured it out how it will end ...<br />Word word word word word word word
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Despite its subtitles, which seem to just disappear as you get deeper into the story..this movie is one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  It explores the meaning of love, to the tune of a handicapped very wealthy teacher and a underprivaleged man who just applied for the job to get unemployement.  True love and friendship abounds.  Racing sooped up wheelchair? its got that.  Car chases? its got that.  Unknown, undiscovered actors?  the best.  Worth watching!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I adored the waltzes and mazurkas most of all. The intimate, sensual extremely sexy arching touching whirling around the floor help me in awe. I loved the under story of Levin and Kitty as well. Very entertaining. I watched it twice!
B000002U82|5.0|I had this album long ago I guess it got broken,So now I am finaly replaced it. It sounds even better than before being that it is remastered. I would recomend it to my friends.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Showed this movie as a combination Religion/Social Studies movie.  Thought it was powerful and informative.  Love that I was in Rome and saw the white line.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just really like the program and liked how it is progressing in the 5th season. Would recomend to anyone who enjoys this type of programming.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was a great movie. Plot was great and well thought. Brought light to Agent J's background, which is very interesting!!  A must see movie!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Having sex with as many women as he can nail, this is your typical James Bond movie.  Lots of action, sex and shooting.  Some parts of the movie seem to be missing...spoiler alert...when Bond is shot for dead, no one explains who pulls him from the water.  The backstory about his old farm house is great.  Other than that, its a typical no story, no plot, shot em up.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I guess because I tried to hard to compare it to the original and the cast, it really bored to find it's own identity.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I always have such a hard time finding a thriller that doesn't read from the police/detective perspective. Crime thrillers always bore me because I'm much more interested in reading a novel from the victims perspective or, even better, the killers perspective. This story was from the victims perspective and was absolutely one of the best top three I have ever read.  It was so gripping that at times I found myself holding my breath with tension cursing through my whole body.  Wonderful, gripping read!!  Side note: the story is not at all hard to follow, even with the dates switching frequently.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler continues to put out fantastic music.  There are a number of songs on this set that are just outstanding.  The best singer/songwriter of my time.
B004J1XYJA|5.0|Read the book wanted to see how well it followed in the movie. Very well done!!!!!!!!  It isn't always so&#62;
1932100660|4.0|I want to read this when time allows as a classic study on what is being hidden by the food industry, the medical system, and phramceuticals in this coutnry.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|When a tragedy strikes close to home, four police officers struggle with their faith and their roles as husbands and fathers; together they make a decision that will change all of their lives.  This movie focuses on Dads trying to be strong fathers and that leads to strong mothers, and then stronger children. And in the end a stronger community.  So many movies have taken to trying to tell us that your average family is a broken one which may be factual, but It's nice to see a movie where there's a strong message of family unity.This movie will stir one to want to be courageous, too.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|It's a mix of Pulp Fiction, Speed Die Hard and twisty creepy! Keeps you thinking and great for a Stay Home on a Saturday Night!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I got this entire trilogy for 26.99 and it was the blu-ray! Definitely worth it as I love the movies and I was looking for something like this to add to my collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I find myself playing this game first each time I pick up my Kindle fire. The coin regeneration is just enough that I have not paid for any coins yet...but it is tempting when prizes are on the edge and I run out. TONS of free fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show gets better and better.  The season premiere offers everything I love about the show: main characters getting bitten, new discoveries, psychological thrills, new disease-free folks, zombie pack mules, and loads of zombie violence.  Love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this game!  The waiting periods are a little extreme, but overall it's a great game!  It's also a little expensive to buy tack and blankets.
1476715904|5.0|Lake and Will's story had me hooked almost from the beginning, and the further along I got, the harder it was for me to put the book down.  The story manages to be both believable and almost a sort of fantasy.  The emotions in the book are raw, tender, and realistic.  I really found myself feeling for the characters and their situations, and certain incidents in the book - such as Eddie's 18th birthday party - left me with goosebumps.  Hoover has crafted a wonderful work here, and I can't wait to read more by her!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game I like the seek and finds the most of all. hopefully the next one has more of that.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.I was skeptical buying yet another lego toy but this was by far the best lego toy ever.<br />My 7 year old son was over the moon with it and spent all of his Summer holidays putting it together.<br />If you think you are missing a piece a word of advice undo part of it and redo it because if bought new all the pieces are there.<br />Also, recommend you have a decent size workspace because it comes in four boxes from 3-6 bags in each.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|My son had seen this film before and when we were looking for a movie to watch he asked to watch it again. We really got into the movie and loved the story and the quality of the film. It was a great time for my son and I and I would recommend to anyone.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|hundreds of Sudoku puzzles in every difficulty, so everyone can enjoy the great number puzzle, and challenge yourself over and over again!
B00130VLZ4|5.0|At first, I hesitated to buy this one because of the price, but decided to give it a try anyway.  Now I know I made the right decision. Not only does it protect my camera from dust and scratches, but its design is very stylish and contemporary. The cheaper alternatives seem to be too bulky and ugly , and I don't really need extra space for batteries, memory cards, etc.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book almost as much as I loved the first. I do wish it was longer.....five stars no question.
0062014536|2.0|I think this is one of those books you'll either love or hate.  I would chose not to read a series vs reading one with an ambiguous ending.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's definitely a step up from the first installment. I enjoy the zip lines and the rail cart system. A definite time killer.
B008L1VZQI|4.0|I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106\\" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6\\" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.<br /><br />Picture is fine, as with most blu-rays.<br /><br />The start menu does not allow you to chose a sound track or subtitles, you need to use the pop-up menu of your blu-ray player once you initiate Play. Otherwise it will play stereo without subtitles.<br /><br />Audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and quite good. With a setting of -9 db on my receiver, the sound stage reaches halfway to the surrounds with the louder passages reaching about 80 db. Orchestra is well laid out and well balanced with the voices, which are clear and stable, thanks to well hidden body microphones. My only complaint is that the voices come only through the center, no movement with the singers.<br />The chorus is nicely spread out in the background. Applause is a bit weak db-wise but from the sides, enhancing the impression of sitting in a front row.<br />If the voices moved with the singers and the sound stage were a bit wider, I would give it 5 stars, so only 4 stars audiowise.<br /><br />As for the performance, it is comedy and does remind me more of Rossini or Donizetti than the more popular Verdi operas like \\"La Traviata\\", \\"Aida\\" or \\"Rigoletto\\", but it still has quite a few nice melodies that will grow on you. Mezzo-soprano Antonacci is my favorite (I can also recommend her \\"Carmen\\" and \\"Les Troyens\\" blu-rays) , but the other voices are also quite o.k. With 6 principals, you will prefer some over others. Nevertheless, it is a well sung and acted performance.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of Emma I have seen.  Kudos to director, Jim O'Hanlon and well done, BBC. A casting coup with Romola Garai as Emma and Jonny Lee Miller as Mr Knightley.<br />Emma is the most whimsical of Austen's heroines with the exception of Marianne Dashwood.  But where she could have come across as a spoilt, matchmaking heiress, Romola plays someone who errs on judgment but is always able to stand up and make amends. She brings a vulnerability and loneliness to Emma that makes you root for her till the end.<br />Jonny Lee Miller executes Knightley with aplomb and I didn't think I would say this, but he rivals Colin Firth's Darcy by bringing in a perfect balance of inscrutability, firmness and kindness.<br />A great supporting cast, a tight screenplay, breathtaking cinematography and updated costumes.<br />Austen would be proud.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This movie was good and funny, however, I felt like it come has been better by being more in depth and by making Loki more of a powerful threat.
1616550414|5.0|The perfect gift for any Zelda fanatic. Tons of concept art and of course the official timeline. You can easily spend hours poring over this book
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great Combo pack.  Digital Copy for our iPhones/iPad for emergencies and the storybook app that my daughter could play for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is the cool game in the world.you can beat your friends scour.i am in the 3 place . LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is just one of the best dramas to come out of the UK.  Every episode brings conflict and engages the viewer in the lives of all the characters.  I started watching after hearing several co-workers engage in exciting conversation about the series, and now I am joining in.  Season 1 was wonderful, but this season is really developing the characters, and I am amazed at how much is packed into even one episode.  So much of television now has resorted to &#34;reality&#34; based shock value shows that are insulting.  This is intelligent and entertaining and has a depth that keeps you wanting more.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed the book and it confirms that chief Kyle was a true hero. I mourn his tragic loss and hope he is looking down from heaven protecting our soldiers.<br />Great book!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a beautifully told story. Diffenbaugh's story touches the heart and teaches the reader something new. The forgotten meanings of flowers, life as a child in &#34;the system', emotional growth, how to start a unique business all can be found within the pages of this novel.  It's also a story about love, forgiveness and family.  Definitely read this!
B001S86J0I|5.0|I'm in my late 30's and my father is a fan of the original Star Trek. To my surprise he had never seen Galaxy Quest, which is why I bought this for him. The best part about the movie concept is that it makes fun of the original material, but not in a way that is mean... it's just funny. Highly recommended!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It's grown up! 007 has evolved. It compared to what The Dark Night did to the old Batman movies. Much much better.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book practically cured my depression I recommend it to anyone of any age (I'm 17) it will help you with whatever your struggling in <3
B008MEM24S|5.0|Gives mom a few minutes to get things done when nothing else works. It is challenging and fun. thanks for making it free
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book literally takes your breath away. It surprises you, makes you cry, and at times extremely happy. If you love a good read I would definitely recommend this book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Every episode of the former five seasons of Fringe is supurbly written and the &#34;actors&#34; could not be more involving. THis is one of the very few TV programs I watch and becae hooked from the very first time I saw it, which was by accident BTW.<br /><br />It is difficult to rationalize whay this type of program would only last five seasons. Just look at the absolute trash that runs over and over, year after year. Too bad it was cancelled but then again so was Star Treck back in the late 60's and look where that led!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Outstanding Romance in the Tradition of The Notebook, Dear John and the Lucky One. Highly recommend this movie set on the coast of Eastern North Carolina.
B00B2064IY|4.0|It was great listening to Hendrix playing songs  I have never heard. I was surprised at the fidelity they were able to achieve.<br />Some licks can be heard that were used in later releases. The composition of his songs seems  some what still in the works, which they were.<br />I am sure there are experimental ideas he is exploring. BUT<br />It is Hendrix and it Rocks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. I like how they move the game to different states. Its pretty cool.They should make the characters cheaper.
B00000IZOR|4.0|Beautiful colors. Has dynamic eyes so they move while children pull it along. My daughter was excited to have it. Great price, but still think it should have been little bigger.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is awesome! Ben Affleck is at his best. There is definitely some Hollywood additions to the true story but its still an incredible story.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|There is something to be said for a 'based on a true story' movie that feels like a good movie in its own right, while still hewing close to the factual truths.  'Argo' walks that line well, with good casting, plotting, humor, and suspense.  Yes, 'suspense', for, like 'Lincoln', the idea that you are caught up in rooting for a side, as if you do not know how it all comes out, is the sign of a well-told tale.<br /><br />So, why 3 stars?  I'd do 3.5 if available, but here's the real thing:  I would do four if the movie was not already so hyped.  I know a review shouldn't be based on other reviews,  but, when 'Argo' was over, I thought, \\"Hmm...that was a decent flick, especially since Carter got to talk at the end.\\"  And that is not the mark of a movie I run out and tell people to watch.<br />  Goodman and Arkin dancing around was stupid, the last-second phone ringing trite,  and the ending smelled of a Hollywood massage for the masses.  (\\"Keep it tense, or we lose them!\\")<br />  If only the level of accuracy in the plot was in keeping with the wonderful recollections of the haircuts and glasses, with a nod to the patience of the audience, maybe I would rate it higher.  Good flick, but just good.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|It's a simple good vs evil story. Like the flashbacks, everyone is attractive and has a comic book feel. Don't watch much TV and don't have cable so Amazon and computers make everything so easy.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|Movie keeps sticking or buffering....it took nearly 2 hours to watch 45 minutes of the show.  This happened to nearly the following episodes.  After all the suggested trouble-shooting, I ordered it from Netflix
B0010T0JC4|2.0|These are not a comfortable as the classic crocs but for work I can't have shoes with holes in them. On the 2nd day of wearing them the tread on the bottom started to peel off and I almost tripped because it was flopping up every time I walked I had to superglue it back down. These make my feet extremely sweaty. Not impressed with these.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|The OC has a great combination of comedy and melodrama that can be appreciated by fans of soaps and fans of TV in general. There are great indie bands and more mainstream artists used in the plethora of songs for this series. At the price it's listed it is about a dollar an episode, which is a great deal for a show of this quality. However, for all of the cleverness, there are some down points, like the latter part of season 3. Overall, this is a great series that's a bargain for the price, with only a small number of bad episodes.
B0093ST02E|1.0|Not very believable, hard to keep going to end! I would not recommend it at all, very very slow and weird in parts.
B00003CXRP|5.0|great movie, kid appropriate, so its good for the whole family, well worth the the money, if you like this movie you would also like return to the blue lagoon.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|even if you don't like the saga the songs are amazing! great quality CD the case was broken when i got it but i permanently keep it in my radio in my car so i don't care. i listen to it at least once a week on my way to school
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this years and years ago, and when a friend recently read it and talked about it, I had to read it again. I love the poignancy of the story of coming of age in hard times, and how the strong persevere. I only wish there was a sequel.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Weak story, but still good. King, like the car in the story, draws you in!  Not all kids or adults are as dirty mouthed as some of his characters. Still worth reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are thinking of something to spice up that time you have together this is the book to do it. I recommend that you read this as a couple and enjoy!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really cool book couldn't put it down. It was straight forward and correctly talked about the raid and was a greatbook
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Use it every day in my classroom and the kids love it!  We can open different versions at the same time, Also, we can choose to read ourselves or have the verses read to us.
1423140605|5.0|You will be glued to this book and have a hard time putting it down. It's such a great read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Graphics were awesome and had a very addicting story line. I couldn't put the game down. I loved how the characters and story developed. The hidden objects weren't too hard to find which made it enjoyable.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I wasn't a fan of the score, it was a bit too soft, but this here hits the spot.  I wish that they made a part II of this.  Love every single remix, and it introduced me to a lot of great artists.  Highly highly recommend this to any Electronica fan!
0307987698|4.0|I thought it would be for a younger child but I will just save it until age appropriate.  A one year old child would not understand this book.  Great message and good graphics!
B001N4RORE|5.0|this is my happy movie....Love the music...the fast pace...the way everyone thinks they are keeping a delightful secret from everyone else.  it is just a delight and has a happy ending. And I am a sucker for a good love story musical.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|This film wowed me when I saw it in theaters during the first run in 1974, and I've seen it many times since, mostly on video or DVD. Watching it this time reminded me why Jack Nicholson was such a magnetic screen presence in the 70s. Even with Faye Dunaway or John Huston onscreen with him, it's hard to look away from Nicholson's dynamic, ever-changing face, always on the edge. The whole production, from the great producer Robert Evans, screenwriter Robert Towne, director Roman Polanski, DP John Alonzo (in theaters, this film sometimes looked almost sickly thanks to Alonzo's subtle yellow/gold tones and slightly overbright sunlit scenes), Goldsmith's score, the exceptional casting, and on, and on.<br /><br />The version I viewed on Instant Video appeared to be completely uncut, and the onscreen HD quality was exceptional -- best streaming experience ever!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is if you have the Kindle it is not easy to look up the different  names associated with different houses. It would have been easier if the maps and names were indexed.  Amazon's Kindle's has the ability to click on words for definitions, it would be great if it could be done for characters of a story...just a suggestion.<br /><br />Otherewise, the plot line and in depth stories keep you on your toes. Martin is a gifted and detailed writer.  You care about the characters and the world they inhabit. I'm normally not a science fiction or fantasy reader, but I got hooked on the series (THE SERIES IS PHENOMENAL!). Both the book and series are excellent, and that is a rarity.<br /><br />This is a note for parents who have kids that want to read the books: Martin's books are not as graphic as the series.  The characters are truly compelling, as they face different obstacles due to either physical deformities or gender based prejudices. Not a bad lesson to teach in a world that puts so much emphasis on the exterior.  Enjoy!
0446554995|4.0|Pendergast is finally re-united with his wife Helen for a \\"few seconds\\" before she is kidnapped.  This starts a tense and heart pounding chase by Pendergast to rescue her.  Later we see Pendergast fall to the lowest emotional depths of his life and none of his friends (Vincent, Laura, Viola) can do much to get him out of his funk.<br /><br />As Pendergast is wrestling with his demons, a serial killer tabbed the \\"hotel killer,\\" is killing hotel guests and leaving weird clues at the scene.  Vincent knows that he needs Pendergast's help to find this killer but it seems that will not happen given his current state.<br /><br />The book is really divided into three separate plots.  Pendergast will later face an enemy greater than Diogenes, Corrie will try to locate and clear her father, and a doctor will try to help Constance (new readers may want to go back to some of the previous Pendergast tales to understand these other characters).<br /><br />This book is loaded with tense moments and Messrs Preston and Child have really upgraded their game setting up gripping and action filled scenes.  They also do a good job of wrapping up this particular trilogy though I wish that Vincent served a larger role in it.  Some of the best prior books were the ones where he is more of a sidekick to Pendergast.<br /><br />Overall, this is not the best Pendergast books but it is a very good one.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A fantastic book that doesn't have to try to hard to draw you in and keep you glued. Highly recommended and I'm looking forward to the sequel, I assume it will have one?
B0042JTDXK|5.0|With this and All That Echoes, I have all his releases and love them all! What a voice he has.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Beautifully made, the songs are wonderful too.  Love the story, although my small kids were scare when it came to the forest and the witches, etc.  But overalls, this is still a great animated movie!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoy reading a story that causes me to reflect and think about our human adventure. Life is full of disappointments, opportunities, adventures, joy as well as profound sadness and how we deal with them maps our future. The separate emotional journeys of Harold Fry and his wife, Maureen were very touching and exemplified the human tendency to throw away happiness when we fail to face what life throws at us. Quick read worth the time.
B004GYY714|5.0|Sold my old stereo system with great FM. Really only wanted NPR and now have it on my Kindle Fire. It has many more stations that I could have imagined and now will try others. Way worth it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is another amazing book by Rick Riordan. This book is a work of art and is even better if you read the Percy Jackson series before hand. I fully recommend it especially if you enjoy Greek and Roman mythology.<br />I'm counting the days 'till the next book comes out:<br />The House of Hades.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I don't remember this when it first came out. I love his voice.With this and Illuminations, I have all his releases.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Another wonderful Pixer movie.  It's funny, cute, and entertaining.  Great family movie even for adults.  Don't mind to watch it over again.
B005FITIK0|5.0|Okay I love Charlize, she's an amazing actor and in this she did not disappoint. I know this shouldn't be a favorite movie, especially considering that it was like watching a train wreck, in slow mo, but I really liked it. I liked how it contrasted who she was versus who she presented her self to be. And I loved that it showed her life as a writer, alone in a room with a computer. Not glamorous at all but so well done that it didn't matter. Mavis is damaged but I think the people around her are pretty messed up too.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I for one don't buy downloads but had most of these songs from a friend. I still plan on getting this CD eventually since I do like most of the songs. Nice to have them on one CD now instead of spread out on 4 EPs but why not put 'I'm Hungover' on there also??? As of this post, the CD is $7.99 and comes with a free MP3 of CD or you can buy the MP3 by itself for $9.49, WTF?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome!!!!! Great for adults and children!!!! Fun safe and addicting!!! A must have!!! Can't get enough of it and keeps us busy!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love those well written stories that transport you to a different time and yet make you feel at home with the characters? Lark Rise to Candleford is such a series.  Each story could stand alone, but one is not enough. You can't wait for the next one. We follow Laura as she leaves home for her first job at a Post Office which happens to be the hub of the community.  We watch as both she and her chosen town change with progress. So glad it was recommended to me!
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I love most of the songs from the Nashville soundtrack even if some sound a bit autotuned. Great show with great music!
B00A31UXLW|3.0|Dragged on a bit but finished well, if as expected. Found myself second guessing the outcome. But the goodies always win?
B009PJXY3M|5.0|She has a great voice and there is a fantastic variety of songs in the the collection. Not one weak song in the lot.
B001NHNG64|5.0|The book keeps pulling you in and makes it really hard to put down lee builds up environment around the characters and then next thing you know something's happening and all of the suspense and action is evenly spaced, a great read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best game ever I just beat my high score and i can't wait to play this game again
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was different and entertaining.  The boy that played in was very good and, of course, Hugh Jackman is always wonderful.
B000V7J82S|4.0|Everyone knows that all the songs are great on this Bob Marley album, and yet this album does not have all the great Bob Marley songs.<br />But to be specific on the VINYL version.<br />PRO) it is 180 gram pressing<br />  sounds is clean<br />Cons)  apparently even 180g pressings can be done hastily, and it shows<br />  Even being purchased from Amazon and double packaged , the disc is not flat. It's the first warped disc I have purchased new.<br />  On Side B on the first track is a visible dimple. Looks like a partial thumb indentation. possibly done while still warm ??<br />  Does not come with 28 page booklet with lyrics and photos as described. Apparently that is just for the CD version.<br /><br />I did not hear any audible distortion from the warpage or the dimple, but I haven't had a discreet listen yet. may contact customer service for a replacement... maybe
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. The movie was good as well. It's a must read!<br /><br />Safe Haven made me cry but amazing book!
B008EEWN6I|5.0|After the disappointment that was Imperfect Harmonies, I'm glad the new Serj album delivers, as one has learned to expect from such an outstanding musician.
B000QS09UC|5.0|Probably some othe best music,Thee best musicians ever recorded.As a all music genre lover it don't get better than this.Pure and Raw!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I enjoy the music from this movie.  I already have the movie, but it nice just to be able to hear the music.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i have had this app for a year now on ny kindle fire .. no problems  actually the best app i ever downloaded
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfers is a really fun game and i have a good tome playing it. I hope you come up with a number two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter really loves this so much she won't stop playing it and when she does its th eat sleep ( if she does sleep) and use the bathroom
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it relaxes my system and I love how it changes themes so if you see subway surfer then you guys should buy it because it is a great deal it's so worth money
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best serial to watch on Amazon. It is very engaging and engrossing, especailly the story line and characters. I would highly recommed it to audiences 18 years and older.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire app has so many options for playing. It was just the classic solitaire game I was looking for and it works fabulously on my kindle fire!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I love super natural shows, same goes with a good horror show. I have to say that this season was pretty interesting; I don't want to give any spoilers, but Ryan Murphy did a great job in producing this series. I just finished watching season 2 as well and it was even better than the first! If you like a good horror/supernatural thriller, than this is your show!
B005PMNBNG|4.0|This is my kind of music. I did not give it a 5 because some songs were not that great and kind of boring. But, overall, I like it a lot.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. I absolutely loved the book.  Upon finishing it, I immediately read the second book, Shadows of the Night.  I can't wait to see how the author resolves the conflicts.  Although sometimes the story drags with background information, it only adds to the development of the characters.  I re-read each book, savoring the details rather than rushing through to see how the plot develops.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|The sound and picture quality is great. I like the extras because I like to see the making of my favorite films, this one especially. However, they didn't go into great detail on the special effects aspect. I bought this particular copy because it had a DVD and digital copy (which I can then add to my iPod, which I only do for movies that I really love)
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle was an amazing young husband, father & soldier. American Sniper was a glimpse into his life. I highly recommend it.
B00000G3I2|5.0|I watch it every time i'm feeling nostalgic about my college and/or high school friends. Just makes ya feel warm and fuzzy. Phenomenal soundtrack too.
0765334798|4.0|OK, I have to admit, I've always wondered what it would be like to be a poor redshirted ensign on the USS Enterprise.  What's your life expectancy?  Don't all the ensigns somehow wonder which one of them is the next one to die some horrible death?  Why do the main characters always receive a more minor form of the same injury that kills the redshirted ensign in about half a second?  So, John Scalzi decided to go ahead and write a book about this phenomenon.  Good for him!  It's a pretty damn funny book, too.  I don't get the negative reviews for this work.  What were you all expecting?  A sci fi version of &#34;Moby Dick&#34;?  &#34;War and Peace in Space&#34;?  Give it a rest.  Redshirts is clever, fun to read and makes you laugh out loud.  So what if it's a little short?  It's better than being a little too long.  Anyone who has read any of Scalzi's previous works knows he does not go in for long, drawn out story lines and plots that have 1500 characters.  Go read Game of Thrones if you want a long, humorless, character-filled opus where the plot barely advances after 1000 pages.  For me, I'll take Redshirts.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I don't think it is a surprise to anyone looking at a Bruno Mars album that it is a rather eclectic mix of music, but all very good. There are a couple of top 40 hits, and a couple of songs that should have been. I definitely recommend checking it out.
B001BNFR6W|3.0|I know that buying used is always a gamble, especially when you haven't seen the product in person, however when something's advertised as like new, you would expect it to be like new and have little damage. In my situation, the case was ripped on the bottom and a few discs had noticable scratches. Love the show, though.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|For sure! The series began (for me) a scosh slowly, then by late first season began to move hard and fast all the way to the elegiac finale (did you see the small bird silently traverse the ceiling?).<br /><br />I was more than pleasantly surprised to find an incredible synergy between this series and \\"A Man For All Seasons,\\" which I viewed after the episode in which Thomas More is executed. And at the series end, what could be finer than to again see \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\"?<br /><br />Movies and premium cable on DVD: More enjoyable than drugs, and a lot less expensive!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|hi subway surf I love your because when ever I go on long trips its the only game that makes me happy!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is great and truly a page turner.  There are many unexpected twists and turns in the plot that keep you wanting to read more.  You'll be surprised right up until the end!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Excellent special effects. Only the script has flaws - seems to have been scripted by committee. Some great scenes intermingled with a sub-par scene. Suprisingly effective nontheless considering how very complex the story is. Soundtrack not a plus, unlike Iron Man. Outstanding scene with Loki versus Hulk is the best single scene in superhero history.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John will keep you up all night turning these pages, and have you cheering for the bad guys at the end.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|I much prefer Sketchbook Pro mobile. I really though it would be different based on the app logo. Just the same as sketch / draw.
B000LB7G00|5.0|ve used these in the work place before. I'm an engineer using Autodesk Inventor. This 3D mouse makes the modeling process move so much quicker. Really cuts down on time.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I tried to get my hotmail account emails to come over the email program that was installed when I purchased my Kindle Fire.. My Comcast acount emails came but not my hotmail. This solved the problem and it works better than the installed program on my comcast emails. A great buy if you use hotmail.
B006BQM762|1.0|This movie was really corny and especially boring I went to see it in the theater originally and thought I would give it a second try but that was definitely not worth it!
B004RPKR34|3.0|This book was very helpful and good learning process. I would recommend the book, but, the book I had purchased was water damaged.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|came very fast, on time, it's beautiful I love Josh Groban. great price. I bought two one for my sister and one for me.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn has a gift for the sick and twisted...female character. WOW! I was not expecting the twist and turns of this story. Could not stop reading until it was over. Another excellent page-turning thriller from Ms. Flynn.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app is just not worth the hassle. I tried to install the original one and number 2, neither will work!  I am very displeased with the fact that it won't work. We have many apps and this one is just not up to parr.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|I'm still playing with it so far, its ben lots of fun and its very easy to use my girl is having fun taking pic of her self
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Really enjoyed the season.  The plot got darker with some interesting twists.  Looking forward to viewing season #5 very soon.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is such a wonderful story it deserves to be read and read again!<br />Abby just wants to start over where no one will recognize her, feel sorry for her or know her father.<br />Travis is the ultimate bad boy! He is a bare knuckle underground fighter, frat boy and total playboy.... That is until he see's Abby for the first time!<br />This is the sweet and irresistible story of Abby & Travis (swoon).<br />Total 5 outta 5 stars!!! You will love this and re-read it again & again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app.It changes theme so its not just Christmas. I totally recamend this app.People who give bad ratings I have no clue if you fell asleepp and wrote it but I love it I would not reaplace this app my favorite one is probably the Christmas theme my high score is 3456754 my highest coins is 2457 I love mystery boxed buy it the best part is its free your hearing from me I love this game
B0049IHX2C|5.0|The DVD arrived in no time, it was well packaged no cracks or breaks.<br />We had a sleepover with 8 10 yr old boys..the movie was a hit...that was the only time that night that it was peaceful.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|First time watching this show missed it when it was running.  I have been a Star Trek fan for a long time and this brought back the excitement of the series.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I finished this book in two days and couldn't put it down. Well written, researched, and leads you to seek out other literature, concepts, and research the companies, people, and concepts Pink mentions. True to the core: we are all salespeople at heart.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I just love this movie.  I was a John Rice Burroughs fan when I was a kid, though I disliked the way old movies portrayed the Tarzan books.  I am impressed with how closely the producers, writers, directors and actors stayed to the original story.  Great special effects and interesting special features.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|Never seen Hairspray until I saw the play this past summer and feel in love with it.  For Christmas my husband purchased me the original.  It was OK.  I later found out the play was based on the newer movie that included songs that were not in the first one. I'm not sure whats deluxe about it...its certainly not the case the DVD came in.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive considered contacting the Tv show 'intervention' because I play this game so much.:)<br />the first step is admitting there is a problem
030746363X|5.0|I loved this book. I was married to a hard core body builder/lawyer for 18 years. I liftred with him for 15 of those. Then i hardly lifted a weight for several years. Tthen I decided to get back into shape. This book is the ticket. Many of the topics in the book are things he figured out. IE, quit overworking, as in Mike Menser's high intensity workout! Give your muscles two weeks off after a workout to failure. It works, you'll grow! You'll drop the fat. Eat clean, no sugar. In addition to this look at the Blood type diet. YOlu don't have to live with cronic pain-a lotof it is diet. Good luck!
B00AMS4H2M|5.0|This is a T.I. collection MUST!  I have almost all of his albums and many singles and collaborations and this is one you need to have.  The production is world class, lyrics are precision bombs, hip hop at it's highest caliber.  I'm grown and have listened to HIP HOP for over 20 years and appreciate how his music still allows me to listen to hip hop.  Many other artist simply don't get my attention.  T.I. has something to say on a grown level.  He proves once again...he has earned BOSS STATUS in the HIP HOP game.
B004M8S440|5.0|I have Georgette Heyer phases, when I feel the need to read a couple of her books, and this has been going on for years, and Venetia is always on my list, it a typical Georgette Heyer romance but Venetia herself is probably the most interesting heroine of all romances, a courageous and intelligent woman who knows what she wants, and manages to get what she wants even if her circumstances and upbringing do not always make this easy. A joy to read, and a book to reread many times.
B004G600A4|4.0|Went to see this with my mom (late 50s) and she loved it so much I bought the DVD for her birthday.  I really enjoy the cartoon movies that entertain not only the younger targeted audience but the older ones too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use!  Wonderful to use.  Loved different versions when using it.<br /><br />Maybe a better look to win one's eyes to download the apps.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Oh my gosh, is there anything as wonderful as the clothes depicted in this period movie? Stunning! The acting, the story,...where do I stop? It's all good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game quite a few years and I keep coming back to it.  I love it. It is a great challenge. I even win here &amp; there.
B002OLE1XU|5.0|wish i saw this in theaters.  this definitely got me back into the series and i cannot wait to watch Fast Six
B000059HB7|4.0|Purchased as a gift and received no complaints.  Not sure of the sound or picture quality but the DVD holder seemed cheaper made than others.
B006I1OB0U|1.0|This should have been included with season 2 purchase. It was the concluding episode for season 2. Why sold separately?
B0063IH60K|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed playing Solitaire on the computer and on a hand held game. Now we can play it on our Kindle. Glad we have this download.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Love being able to get full access to Facebook instead of just the mobile version!<br />Wish my kindle fire had Adobe Flash though so I could play all my games on<br />Facebook :(
B009FZFONO|4.0|Season 3 got me very excited.  I was so happy to have it back, but a little disappointed because it isn't as action packed as the first two seasons.  Don't get me wrong, its still awesome, just a little slower and more cerebral than the first two season.
068987474X|5.0|Great Advice, I use to wonder what I was doing wrong for many years, now I know not to waste precious time on a man that's not interested in me.
B008HT4FUW|1.0|When you don't know what you don't know...this DVD did not include the &#34;Christmas Special&#34; which transitioned from season 2 to the next season. Didn't know what that was until we watched all episodes on this season then tried to start season 3. We had to go back and purchase the Christmas Special that, luckily was sold individually, to continue the story. This omission should have been more clear or not been sold at all without the whole season.
B0053O89U6|5.0|I can't believe I put off watching this show for so long, it's brilliant. The cast has great chemistry and the writing has me often laughing till I cry. Definitely worth watching.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Easy to read and find financial information. Articles are updated daily and offer insight into the market. Would recommend to anyone  interested in the current economy.
B0027ZGPDC|5.0|confusing, but nice twist.  Definitely a must see.<br /><br />I hope they tie this one in somewhere else along the line but it could be a cool spin off
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent, a must read. I hope they turn them all into movies. I couldn't put it down, finished reading in 3 days.
0062238868|5.0|An incredible story by an incredible man! Chis Kyle sets the true standard for American patriots!  His selfless acts of courage are so very inspiring.  I salute this brave man and hope that one day in heaven I will have the opportunity to shake his hand!<br />Truly, he acted as a guardian angel for so many of our young soldiers. He has our respect and admiration!  This is a really great book!!!!!!!!!!!
B003L77FYS|5.0|This show fills a place that was missing after the cancellation of Firefly. Nathan Fillion is brilliant and the writing is wonderful. Absolutely not just another cop drama.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|We have owned Casablanca for many years on VHS. However we haven't watched a VHS video in so long we don't even know if the player still works, and the player isn't even hooked up to our media center. Having this great movie on DVD is great.<br /><br />This is one of our top 10 best movies of all time. We've watched it so many times we know most of the dialog by heart. We are always impressed that just about every word spoken in Casablanca is pertinent to the story. There are no wasted &#34;fillers&#34; of dialog.<br /><br />Great movie. Bogart's best.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This movie was insane.  Denzel proves how good of an actor he is.  He is so dynamic.  This isnt an action flick, but a drama, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The end has a great twist to it, but helps make DW a much more likable character in the end.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|A marvelous way to celebrate a birthday....with some of the worlds top artists from opera to country.  And it all fits!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good hidden object game that has lots of little extra things going on. Even mix up the way u search for things like with a flashlight pretty cool way to kill some time.
B009AMALGM|5.0|This is a really good movie , I had done seen 1,2, and 3 . So this was the only one i was missing ! It was shipped very fast !
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I love this backpack.  Great for work or travel. I have a huge dell laptop and it fits great.  Several pockets for everything you need and to keep organized.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Yes, you read that right!<br /><br />Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood just work so well together.  Throw in Justin Timberlake and you have a really good movie.  Clint is getting old but still extremely effective as an actor.  The one liners are back and the story line is good for the whole family minus one F-bomb and Adams stripping down to her granny panties in one scene.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|you can see the numbers day or night, you kendal has to be on for the timer to go off, and if your kendal has a time set to shout down no alarm
B007JWKLP6|5.0|Like the title says, this is an extremely nice documentary that sheds light on George's life and the Beatles upcoming, and the whole thing is very fun to watch with great music (of course!).
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Fifteen years ago I saw the stage production of Les Miserables and was so moved by it I just HAD to read the book from which it was derived. Victor Hugo created such emotional highs and devastating lows the experience altered my perspectives on life generally. His descriptions of each character were so vivid I felt I knew them and could completely comprehend their actions and responses. Already involved in theatre I grabbed any opportunity to be involved in local productions of the stage show. My knowledge of Victor Hugo's detail enabled me to explain to cast members the underlying motivations for their characters behaviour. No matter how often I read Les Miserables I am still so touched by the authors ability to &#34;take me there&#34;. I cannot recommend this book more highly.
B004YRWA62|1.0|I rented this movie because I saw it listed on a top 100 videos list and the plot sounded somewhat interesting.  Unfortunately, it was not interesting, hard to follow and went in reverse order chronologically.  Don't waste your time watching this.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The BAU is back with season 7.  Awesome season, a little bittersweet.  Love JJ and Rossi.  A nice twist on crime dramas.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I really like these games. Taking forever, I'm talking hours to download. Been 6 hrs and not even 50% downloaded. I'm trying be patient, but just about ready to say forget it and stop stupid thing. Hope they fix it. It says may take few minutes, but  this been over 6 hrs. If download and I play it, I will give it 5 stars. That is why  I've only given it 1star..grrrrrrrrrrr. Took 2 days download & Now it won't open. Not happy at all. So it only gets 1 star.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Not sure what I can say that hasn't been said. If you like fantasy, mystery, thriller, or the like, you'll enjoy this book. Wonderfully written and you don't want to stop reading. It's a bit like a dark King Arthur.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it a fun game comeout with more :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) please come out with more I will love to play them :) . :) :) :) :)
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I took my husband to see this movie the day after I first saw it.  He hates subtitles, but I insisted.  After the movie had finished and the credits were run, I asked him what he thought of the movie.  He said go to Amazon and order it now.  We had to wait for months until it came out, but it is worth the wait.  This is one of the most uplifting movies I have ever seen, and to know this is a true story, makes it even better!
B004D2GMR6|5.0|My wife is a huge Bon Jovi fan. So I bought this DVD for her and she watches it nearly every day. The sound quality is there and they play all their hit songs. The video quality is pretty good as well. You can tell that Jon Bon Jovi is holding back his voice however and doesn't sing the high parts on some songs like the chorus of Living on a Prayer. Instead he points the mic at the audience and has them sing it (an old audience participation trick to make them feel good while the singer saves the effort). But he's still entertaining enough to watch. He does interact with the audience well and that's why he is still around. Still a lot more acoustic playing than I like but I didn't buy it for me so if the wife is happy then I'm happy. It's directed more for girls, that's what Bon Jovi really is all about anyways. So if your girlfriend or wife likes him they will love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It . Is like an addiction trying to get to the next level. I play this game more than I do anything, anymore.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The extras are not as extensive as some blu-rays, but they are informational and entertaining. The commentary by Sam Mendes is awesome! Image transfer is excellent as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing but if you don't play it a lot it will undownload and you have to start over but other than that it is a great game
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover for my Kindle Fire is just what I expected.  It truly protects it well.  I wish I had purchased it when I got my Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I wasn't sure at first but afterward. Its the best. Highly recommended this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my Butt started itching so I told my mom and she said son can you scratch my butt. so I said sure
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is a great story for sci-fy lovers. I would have loved to have watched this while still on TV. Too bad the 5th season was their last. Clever stories and fun characters. It is nice to be able to see this series in order and when I have the time to watch. I've ordered the whole 5 seasons on DVD. The only problem; I've watched season 1 and am waiting for season 2 to arrive. Meanwhile season 3 & 4 are here tempting me to see them out of sequence.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is probably my favorite way to waste my time. The first part of the game is somewhat slow to allow you to get used to the controls, but then it speeds up.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app to keep on top of the current conditions. Radar Ten day forecasts and warnings are here for you.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Very good movie, must have if you enjoyed the first 2 like I did. Josh Brolin steals the show as the young K, a perfect performance on his part. The story line is good and they manage to swing back and explain some history of J's. Fun movie to watch, has a very similar feel to the other MIB movies. Recommended.<br /><br />-D
B008RA3X5E|5.0|in love with this app, does everything i need it to do and has awesome features, does everything for a great low price
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|I've heard of 'B' movies before -- this is a 'D' movie. Two pretty well known actors lure you in but the story was ridiculous & the acting was atrocious--all in all even the most avid military buffs (like my husband) wouldn't recommend ths movie.
B006H5120E|5.0|It is strange that the 3D version only came out recently.  My wife pester me to get this one and probably this is one of the BD I bought without &#34;nagging&#34;.<br /><br />I got it at a real good price. NO REGRET, the quality is DEMO level.  recommended!~
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Overall a great movie and I'm glad I got it. I'm an old video gamer and I had hoped for a little more nostalgic references - there are quite a few but they don't really key on them like I had hoped. No big deal though.<br /><br />Good story, a little formulaic but worthy of ownership. The short was good too, the Paper Man. Always good when a short doesn't have to rely on words to get its point across (ala Birds).<br /><br />-D
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The Descendants was a great movie! It was in good condition when I received it and very affordable. Loved it!
B002JC9RMY|1.0|dragon ball?? dont be kidding me!!!!!! this is the worst insult someone could have done to the glorious dragon ball anime....... I think only its name has something to do with db.......... i dont know how other people gave 5 start....this film deserves a -5..... im pretty sure they have NEVER been db fans and will never understand the only thing you can do with this film is throw it away in your garbage can....
B007MDB548|5.0|Well, when it comes to Disney Blu Rays, I believe there will be no disappointment in terms of quality.<br /><br />Both 2D and 3D are very smooth and clear.  I watched it with my kids at least 5 times!  I need to let them forget about asking for the movie again and again, else I probably can't enjoy other BD I bought from AMazon then.<br /><br />It is good demo too.  definitely 1 BD I'll enjoy if I get myself a 3D projector!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Demick paints a realistic story of deprivation and delusion from the perspective of those who were strong enough to survive and to escape North Korea's oppressive regimes.  This book is a timely read given the current events in North Korea and China, and is a real page turner.  The book puts our own &#34;first world&#34; problems into context and demonstrates how easy it is for us to take for granted our basic human rights.  This book is required reading at our high school for the sophomore class, and I strongly approve of its selection as a companion piece to Orwell's &#34;1984&#34;.
B005H9B44A|3.0|With the cast and the director, I expected more than I got.  It was still an okay movie, but I reallyl wanted more out of it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is entertainment; but how can the English live like that. Still Issac Newton developed calculous and chewy cookies, gotta love that.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fell to the hype. Once I started,I felt obligated to finish. Glad it's over. I'm sure there are some that may derive something from this book........
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is very simple and fulfills the basic needs. Soooo just buy it. I mean it's free for crying out loud
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It isn't your normal boy meets girl romance, I liked that it had a back story and had some deeply emotional twists.  It was an interesting read.I would recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|3.  Arrange the list in order of importance to you, both personally and professionally. Take into consideration how certain items on your list might affect others (for example, someone might need something from you in order to do his or her job. If so, you can't neglect that responsibility).
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Enjoyable game, but I have deducted a star as it could be a bit quicker in the area of land developments. I have tried to make it as \\"free\\" as possible by trying not to buy extras....tip. stars are way better value over coins....A bit frustrating to spend stars when I was trying to collect a load of coins. In addition, the game has a few glitches meaning I can't visit my allies _ bar one
0743270754|5.0|I enjoy an author that takes the time to do good research for a subject as important to US history as this one. Meticulously researched and referenced Goodwin weaves a splendid narrative that doesn't resort to myth-making. Enjoyed my time with this book very much.
B005JABU82|4.0|RG gundam model is high Cost-effective model series. Its super detailed in 1/144 size. But after made it i feel MG size is better for me.it looks really weird that so many details huddled together in a small area. It only my personal opinion. The model itself is well made& designed.
031606792X|5.0|I got this quickly and well pacakged. It is brand new and is the exact book. There were no blemishes on the book wrap and is brand new.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I admit, this game can be somewhat frustrating, but completing your goal is very satisfying.  I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys puzzle games.  The graphics are good and the physics are amazing.  The best part is that anyone at any age can play this game and enjoy it.  I find it difficult to pay more than ninety nine cents for a game, but this game is definitely worth more than that.  I probably wouldn't pay the four ninety nine that they are asking for it, but I'm a bit of a cheapskate when it comes to Android games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series. Very interesting how things were done in a home such as this. The time period is so interesting also.<br />Then the clothes!!! Love it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game. I don't really have time to sit and do an entire puzzle so this game gives me that time. And I really love the pictures u get to choose from
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you like 80s pop culture and video games, this book is a must read! I was getting angry the closer I got to the end of the book because I knew the fun would be over soon.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|I'm always hesitant to give an album 5 stars. Can an album truly be perfect? I was also curious about this album, due to its numerous five-star ratings. However, I have seen several albums on Amazon marked overwhelmingly as 5 stars, when in reality, they are atrocities to mankind (e.g. Seether).<br /><br />Luckily, this album is worth every one of the golden stars, encompassing a classic rock sound, an emo-esque lead guitar and an overall sense of fun. Therefore, this album goes amongst the collection with Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Creedence Clearwater Revival, not necessarily for similarities in sound, but for a never-ending display of great songs and a timeless feeling that too many bands miss out on.<br /><br />Considering every song on here is a great tune (and how many albums can you say that about, I wonder?) so, to all the Springsteen, Creedence and Who fans, stop listening to the Eagles (ugh) on classic rock radio and dive into something wonderfully timelessly old and new.<br /><br />Personal recommendations: Great Expectations, 59 Sound, Even Cowgirls Get The Blues, Miles Davis and the Cool
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I did not like Wentworth's ignoring Anne until near the end of the movie. Anne's family was so ignorant towards her, especially her sister. What a witch! Her father was an a$$
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So simple for the first several levels that even small children could figure it out, and adults will find it relaxing to play. But then seemingly suddenly, as the difficulty increases, there is some real brain power required to figure out the puzzle. I've found that when I'm stumped, if I turn the board horizontally it helps me figure out the solution by showing a different perspective.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved it! I was in suspense throughout the entire film. All the performances were impeccable. I would highly recommend this film.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|funny and adventurous i highly recommend this movie.  i laughed and i was grossed out and sometimes at the same time....
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a wonderful story.  Reminds you of what took place in World War II as well even though this is mostly about WW I.  Can't wait to read Winter of the World
B004E0Z4XK|2.0|Took two weeks to deliver, I mistakingly thought it was a Norah Jones album, I should have investigated further as I was very disappointed to hear mostly dreamy 1960' Italian Western background music with very few solos of the artists featured, This was a good learning experience as I should have listened to \\"sample music\\" pieces before buying, but I noticed on Amazon not all CDs have music listening options to hear excerps, maybe the LSD now gentrified group will like this but not me, listening to a solo now finally and I am hearing la la la la la la la, unbelieveable!<br />:&lt;(
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I didn't know Tim Gunn did the voiceover for one of the characters until I just watched it with my daughter. I found this movie to be a cut above some of the other movies my daughter has watched in the best.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|i didn't know this was the prequel to alien (i know, duh) cuz i just don't watch a lot of movies.  it was a great flick!<br /><br />character selection, dialogue, special effects, story line, ending were all great.... a really interesting movie that i will recommend to others...
B0090CMMIC|5.0|I love rock, having been in high school in the early 2000's I really enjoy that sound. I was unable to find anything the past few months that was new and good but this is a great album. I love the variation between the songs. Some are slow, some faster paced, and it shows the band has some real talent. I checked it out on Spotify first and was pleasantly surprised that I liked all the songs.
B0094OLFUW|3.0|I love this album but I wasn't too keen on the price that I noticed after the fact--the digital album costs more than the CD.  What the hell?
B005IQ39AY|2.0|game.  I would not recommend this Can't quite figure it out.  Hopefully someone else can do a better job of it.
B000U7169M|4.0|The Reaping is a bout a woman played by Hillary Swank who is not so much an investigator, but more someone with the expertise and knowledge where what people think is miracles, can actually be explained scientifically. So far she has found the actual logical and real causes behind around 50 cases from around the world and debunked them all as miracles by finding out what has really caused the events happening around the circumstances.<br /><br />However, things on her latest field trip off campus may or may not be explainable, but it will be her toughest once to crack yet as she is sent to a small town called Haven where the folks there beleive a child is bringing on the 9 plagues of the bible. She and her associate The Black Power Ranger have been called in to check out why a river has turned to blood... and discover that the townsfolk are all pointing their fingers at one child they beleive to be evil.<br /><br />Will she discover things are not what they seem, or will she discover something much more evil then she thought possible?<br /><br />Overall, it was a good film with excellent pacing from start to finish. It doesn't bore you to death with useless dialog or events to stretch the film out. The effects are decent, the suspense is OK, and the acting is pretty decent. My only beef with the movie is it could have used a better finale instead of it just happening and being over and done with.<br /><br />Not sure if I would watch it again soon, but maybe one day when I forget about it I will check it out again. So not sure I would go out of my way to buy this film, but it's definitely worthy of a rental.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This was a great movie that shows the dilema of growing up and parenting from a different angle. it is funny and entertaining.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is such a page turner! And I have been losing so much sleep!<br />Hugh Howey you're a genius! please write more books!
B004GYY714|5.0|Works good!  I can use it when I'm not near a radio or in range of the station at my location.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Outstanding quality of graphics and design. Easy to read and understand. Top notch information given for weather and radar quality is outstanding.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|No problems with the download.  It arrived in seconds.  It is a great read.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban had more say in the process as a producer, and he delivered. You won't be disappointed. I plan to watch the video as well.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like how sounds can be layered and volume changes for each sound, as you choose.  Pretty great app.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Loads of fun for all ages.  Addicting, can not put it down. Easy, simple and great for everyone.  Terrific job.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Dark Arcana the carnival is great. It is so addicting. It does seem to go by too fast though. It felt like there wasn't enough scenes to navigate. Maybe its because i was having too much fun. G5 games are great!
B00005JNX0|5.0|I like everything about this movie. Great animation. Wonderful cast. Fun story. We have watched this one several times already.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I had some idea of what to expect about this book before I read it, and I am not easily offended, but I could see why this book might offend someone. This is a true story with a man's true feeling and some people may not be able to understand where he is coming from. If you are not an opened minded person you may also feel that some of his writing is a bit &#34;rude&#34;. I enjoyed the book, I of coarse read it after he was killed, which I think gave it more of an impact in light of all the people he was trying to help that went to war, to be killed the way he was, Definitely worth reading!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|If you have ever worked in sales or been around sales you have to see this movie.  The acting is superb as is the story.  Take a look at how few locations are included in the movie and how impressive the story is even taking into account that it is an adapted theater script.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an Amazing love story!! I hope the movie is just as good! Easy read and an awesome story line!
B001GQSY5K|5.0|I've read so many reviews and I still like it! I bought it mostly for my daughter, but have watched it several times on my own. And I'm an old, hardcore Wars fan.
B00AU15HPC|1.0|2 songs on this CD, \\"It's Cold Outside of Your Heart\\" and \\"Broken Dream\\" are remakes of earlier Justin songs from years ago. These remakes aren't nearly as good as the originals. The final song on the CD \\"Out There Somewhere\\" is a remix of yet another Justin song, \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere.\\" The remix goes on for more than 8 minutes, though it feels like 8 weeks. This is classified as a new album. It kind of is, but it really isn't. I'm a diehard Moody Blues fan who has enjoyed Justin and the group forever. But the fact of the matter is that the Moodies haven't been what they used to be for the last 20 years. This CD is the latest disappointment. I pretty much wasted $10.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I was on the fence about getting a flash for my DSLR since they are so large and cumbersome.  I'm shocked with how ofter I actually end up using it when shooting (almost all the time now).  The effects when shooting indoors are noticeably improved with bounce technique and as a remote flash it works perfectly.  I haven't had any issues with flash output and would recommend this as a great all around flash for anyone who is considering adding one to their lineup.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|good love story but also very suspensvul  looking forward to seeing movie sparks is very good at drawing you into the story
0763655465|5.0|The purchase of this book was a must after our experience of Little Owl Lost which is just so beautiful.  As with his previous book &#34;Oh No George&#34;  is visually very unique and stunning.  The visual images give a stillness to the scene that only emphasise the plight of poor George as his desire to be good is stomped on by his impulses and desires.  My 4 year old loves the story, affectionately joins in with the &#34;oh no George&#34; when it all goes wrong (somewhat empathically I suspect) and finds his antics hilarious. Both of Chris Haughton's book capture a kindness and what would seem the spirit of the animals he chooses as characters.  The repetitions of plot are not tedious, create great anticipation and are effective developmentally for children from toddler through to early school years.  It continues to be highly requested at bedtime.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great 5star game.I totally recommend this game to you guys.It is very addicting! Please get this awesome game.,!
1594135592|5.0|Super fast delivery.  This is a great book!  I love the large print edition.  I'll recommend this one to all of my friends.
0385339089|4.0|I chose this rating because I really liked the book.  The action is very rapid, and the hero is very much a little man -- the man of the house.  However, I found there were some things that did not ring true, like Reggie doing all that work and all that driving, and risking losing her license, all for one dollar.  However, it shows that there are idealists who care more about justice than about money.
B006JD48NM|4.0|Saw this video in theaters a year or two ago and was waiting for it to be released on DVD. The story as told can be kind of dry, but if you are a TRUE Formula One fan, the video provides good perspective on the controversial Prost/Senna &#34;war&#34;.
B009NNG202|1.0|the movie had good acting, good back grounds and you could tell lots of effort was into making it, but it all ended dumb. It  all came to a point like someone pulling the pin on a grenade and that was it. sudden dumb, makes no sense end, did not care for it
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|You can tell the people who made this movie truly love video games. They went through so much care and detail on all aspects that you get absorbed into the movie.<br />For those who do not like the idea of a video game movie, it is more than just what you think. This is Disney after all, and lets face it in these recent years Disney movies have become better. The story is wonderful and moving with characters that were well developed leading to some heart wrenching scenes.<br />All in all I would recommend this movie for a family night or to any body that likes Video games, and I really recommend it for both.
0385338600|3.0|A Time to Kill seemingly justifies killing, which is illegal and against most major religions and against ethics.  However, it shows that the circumstances can explain why a person can lose control and actually plan a killing in cold blood.  This book should only be read by a very mature audience with a sense of right and wrong because of the content.  I was disappointed when Jake the teetotaller started drinking more than he ought to.  As a matter of fact, I found there were scenes that were unnecessary, but that showed that even the best lawyers are human and therefore not perfect.  Moreover, I found the title very similar to To Kill a Mockingbird, which is also about a rape.
B007NU54H4|5.0|My daughter loves everything Tinkerbell and loved the story of Tinkerbell now having a long lost sister!<br /><br />Great Job Disney!
B003AKEGRK|1.0|I really can't say anything good or bad about this movie because I really didn't watch it, I brought it up, low battery lite came on, it went on charge, next time I opened Kindle I just wiped it out,
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I bought it for thrift shop, but the rest of the album was just as good.  This album makes me wish I lived in Seattle.
1451696191|5.0|I'm 30 years old and this is my new favorite book. It may sound strange, but I actually missed the main character when it was finished.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love playing this game with friends and family!  It's neat to see everyone's perspective on how to draw an object or person.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Spent over a hr trying to download this book and it never worked. I'm done trying ill stick to the plain paperback with ledsvof a headache. What a waste of time. Hope some of u others can get it to work.
0395925037|5.0|Great read still reading because it is that great. The book is very deep and has and in depth veiw of hitler
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Loved this show. Love having the DVDs to watch over and over.  I'm having to hide them from my kid brother who is trying to swipe them.  :)
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Wow!  This game is so much for for the little kids!  My daughter is 5 and she would play this for 2 hours straight if I let her!  (which I don't!  Ha ha)<br /><br />Although the illnesses repeat themselves she does not grow tired of it and still has a lot of fun playing this.
B003VANOFY|4.0|for the price is got it for (around $70, it was on sale) this headset was a steal. The sound quality is great, i love the software to change your voice or customize what the buttons on the headset do, and IT'S WIRELESS! The only gripe i have with it is that the mic is SUPER sensitive. When talking to people on Skype i am commonly told that i am heavily breathing on the mic or that people can clearly hear my fan, or chair squeaking. There is a  way to change the sensitivity on the mic with the software given to you but it doesn't seem to work. I tried putting the sensitivity lower and every time i would talk it would automatically boost it to be very sensitive again.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product and was totally worth the discounted price i got it for, and the only reason it got 4 stars was because the mic is a little too sensitive
0061122416|5.0|Woooooow I dont know where to even begin. Let me start off by saying greeeeaaatest / deepest boook I have ever read in life (except for the bible of course). Read it!!
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Interesting reading about factors which have influenced the ascent of man that I had not considered before. It does a nice job explaining the societal and technological diversity we see in the world today.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game will hold your attention for a long time!  Challenging and a good time waster.<br /><br />Even my daughter who is 5 loves playing the lower levels over and over
B008B68J2G|5.0|My nine year old loves Monster High and this play set was no exception, this Scaris set goes along with the movie that just came out and makes a super fun way to play with the Monster High (or any other) dolls. The cart comes with a table and umbrella, chair and bench, along with a handful of small accessories. This is a fun way to make your Monster High dolls coffincinos (lol) and play in a new way.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|a great movie but not as expected from the flyer that made the pilot out to be a savior but the story reversed it in the movie.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Filmed in a size film that was typical to the period of its setting, but no longer used, \\"The Master\\" feels and looks like a mid-century, big studio film, lush and expensive.  Costumes and mannerisms seem to be point-on.  Just as a film, \\"The Master\\" is worth watching and easy to look at.  The subject matter is apparently Scientology, but the film is not peddling Scientology, although I understand that the more you know about it, the more you'll take away.  I know little, and don't feel I missed much.  I grew up in California, I live in San Francisco, so when someone comes up and tells me that \\"This Rock\\" is the new God, I'm neither impressed nor amazed;  I've seen a lot of such rocks.  Still, it is interesting to see a cult in action, from at it's inception...<br /><br />Joachim Phoenix got a lot of press for getting so deep in character and staying there.  The problem is that it seems he started a bit prematurely.  Freddie Quell is a loner, and one of those screwed up war veterans that we take for granted from WWI and Vietnam, but for which the narrative of WWII seems to have had all veterans stepping off the boat and going to school, and moving to a cul de sac.  The problem is, Freddie was messed up IN the Navy, and probably had issues before he was drafted.  So, now the War is over and Freddie can't get it together.  He blows one job as a department store photographer; he blows a job cutting cabbages---although in truth, that wasn't entirely his fault.  Then, walking down one of those docks by the bay, he stumbles upon a yacht party, and wakes up on the yacht, sailing out, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge.  But this isn't just any yacht, it's the yacht of Lancaster Dodd, who may or may not be L. Ron Hubbard.  This could be real scary, but when you're Freddie Quell and your life is a fruit bowl where the apples and oranges are discriminating against the bananas and mangos, as foreigners, Dodd comes across like a pineapple set in the middle of the table, in it's ownspace, and Freddie enter's his orbit, willingly.  For his part, Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) sees Freddie both as an oddball like himself;  entertainingly independent from him; and someone to prove his philosophy upon, by curing him.<br /><br />It doesn't quite work out that way, but the getting there is entertaining enough.<br /><br />As it turns out, Dodd is something of the figurehead for a cult of his wife's ideas, as played by Amy Adams.  He's got the bombast and stage presence to take her ideas to the Big People who will listen.  Although as the movie progresses, Freddie's loose-cannon mentality becomes more of an attack dog, acting on the behalf of his Master, but not always with the Master's orders.<br /><br />This is a relationship movie, about people and their relationships;  and how people will surrender themselves to other people, often with the least plausible reasons for doing so;  as a result, there's lots of talking, and very little action.  No special effects.  And, while it's a pretty movie to watch, you don't see a lot.  It takes place in San Francisco, New York, and Philadelphia, but much of it is filmed in Mare Island (navy ship yard) and Vallejo, so in many ways it's a studio backlot film, but with real places as the back lot, but still not an on-location film.  That works, for the most part, in setting the film in its own bubble of a lost reality, from another era;  you're never really where you are supposed to be, but then again, so are most of the characters in this film.<br /><br />If you can sit still for an action-free movie, and don't get all riled everytime someone talks about their religious ideas, this may well prove to be a quietly entertaining film for you.n the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book. I know I won't be able to put it down either!!!! Let's get started
B000LB7G00|4.0|I got this to use with Sketchup and it works very well.  I find it not as intuitive as I would like, but I suspect that is my problem and not that of the device, which works wonderfully.  If you use Sketchup, I highly reccomend you get one and learn to use it.  It will make iife more enjoyable.  Just bear in mind, that if you are like myself, it has a bit of a learning curve.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Was hoping with the RZA and Tarantino's backing, not to mention a few great action/genre stars that this would be great. What it actually is is stilted, nonsensical and actually pretty boring. About the only good fight scenes in the film are the Gemini and Liu's, which was unfortunately too short. I wonder who the fight choreographer was because especially during the start of the film everyone looks like they're floating and the action is both slow and ineffectual.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Best movie ever! Marvel did an excellent job setting up with movie and Joss Whedon made it into a masterpiece.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|is a great product ship faster and good price, thank u very much, i love it and im bery happy with this
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Russell Crowe is tremendous in this film .It is a gripping tale of what sea duty was like way back when sails propelled the ships of war.I have viewed this picture many times and still enjoy it.It is  a don't miss film. EJS
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I use this app a lot to get user reviews for hotels.  It is really nice to see what people say about a place, and what kind of experiences they had there.  I don't stay anywhere that doesn't have lots of positive feedback!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am an avid reader and have been wanting to read this book for a long time. I wasn't disappointed! The twists and turns didn't let up for a minute and the gripping suspense lasted for almost the entire book. It was extremely well written and I highly recommend it. As much as I wanted to find out what happens, I didn't want it to end - a sign of a really good book.
1575666286|5.0|I had done research on the Gerson Diet and finally broke down and bought the book. Incredible information! It may not be what people want to hear, but this method forbids most of the foods that Americans LOVE! And it all hinges on coffee enemas! Yes, I said coffee enemas! But don't let that discourage you from trying this, it explains alot about how cancer starts and how to basically starve it to death. This isn't just some smoke and mirrors method, it is based on real science. Antioxidants  are the things that cleanse us of free radicals that stimulate angiogenesis, the growth of veins to supply the abnormal cells that form tumors, fruits and veggies prohibit this growth. The coffee enemas help the body rid itself of the toxins that get concentrated in the liver, kidneys, and bowel. This is a good read, and a better alternative to chemo. You won't be wasting your money by purchasing this book, ill or not.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a very well written book, the details  the author  has a wonderful style of describing the events  of this story.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I was disapointed I couldn't watch it in HD. Amazon requires you watch all their HD movies on their hardware. I don't have that. I wasted my money. I don't remember seeing any advanced warning stating I needed a Kindle to watch their movies.  I will not do that again.
0684824906|5.0|The first time I saw or read anything of Mrs. Goodwin was on Ken Burns special &#34;Baseball&#34;.  She was very good before the camera and showed she had an excellent historical knowledge of baseball.
0062238868|5.0|Get it.  Read it and think about how American needs men like this.  After about the third chapter I didn't put it down.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is a fantastical adventure of a mysterious traveler as you trek through mystical environments and the most amazing landscapes ever designed. Journey is the most profound game I ever played, deeply artistic and soulful Journey is well worth several play throughs 10/10.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a really really good game but very addictive and the stuff on the game is not over priced so that's good aswell
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book.  I was really surprised by the ending.  I would recommend it to all of my reading friends.  Great!
B008Y212PI|5.0|If you're looking for a good and relaxing way to spend some time, this game is for you! But beware it's addicting! I love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book gave me an amazing new perspective on diary style books. You are able to imagine the life sky lived compared to the life after Holden. The book brought me to the verge of tears multiple times and I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a heartfelt, shocking, intense romantic novel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love playing this game ! its so fun and very realistic. there is always something to do and always room for expansion
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Love it! Arrived two days earlier than I expected, which was a bonus. Nice looking and easy to use. Very sturdy.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I've been waiting to watch this movie for months, finally did last night and I have to say it was worth the wait
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was a winner. I'd recommend it to anyone who's read all of the books. I can't believe Greg suffers so much!
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I am a Steely Dan/Donald Fagen aficionado if there ever was one, but this release left me feeling a little blasé. Donald Fagen is (as is Steely Dan) renowned for the quality of his productions, and in this release, he does not disappoint in that regard. But though the music is catchy, the lyrics about a 'dirty old man and his young chick' that permeate nearly every song on the album, are becoming quite old. The Bottom Line: If you like Donald Fagen you'll probably like (but not love) this album. If you're not a fan already, you'll likely be unimpressed. For you LP lovers, the vinyl release is pressed on really cool clear vinyl!
B004J4WLB4|1.0|Hated it.  I like to like the characters.  What's to like?  Sorry.  Im an avid reader, but this just didn't do it for me.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This amazing end to the trilogy is horrifying, frightening, amazingly beautiful. I enjoyed this book and was thrilled by the fast paced plot, the great story, and the beautiful writing by the AMAZING, SUPER TALENTED, Lauren Oliver!! I loved this book, it's a great read and I can't wait for the next one!! (She has to write one right? There's no way she can leave us hanging like this!)..... So all in all,read this book series!! I loved it!!!<br />BTW, someone should totally make a t-shirt that says there are more of us delirium lovers than you think!! Lol!!<br />~&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3~
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the entire series of Downton Abbey, Season 3 had a little more depth and intrigue.  I liked that they have added more characters to the staff,  I treat myself to each night to one episode.  I will definitely purchase Season4 when it is available.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|No, there is no real &#34;talking&#34; in the first half hour of the movie, but I honestly didn't notice until someone else pointed it out. It's such a good movie: well done, great message, uplifting. I personally like that it's one of the few Disney movies that isn't about princesses falling in love... those movies are great too, but this movie is more relevant to our time period
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing how horribly medical people treated this woman and how much they learned from her cells.<br />It's a shame one thought to compensate her or her family for the use of those cells<br />A fascinating, well written book.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|fun game. takes a while for more turns to happen but fun to kill time with. linked it with my facebook to stop the pop ups.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I don't notice much of a difference with this amplifier.  I wasn't expecting miracles but I get the same sound with or without this, and yes I'm sure Its on.  It may possibly be defective.  But it's too late to return.  It might work better with the iPhone adapter, but 9 dollars is too much to spend, just to find out.
B0001I561E|5.0|I love this movie. I gave my sister a copy too because we're 90s kids and this was one of our favorites growing up. 100% recommend
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|This was a hodgepodge of many movies rather than anything original.  Horrible that the Moneypenny character was such a bad shooter and they made it look normal.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love this series, I have the books and they are wonderful too but seeing it is pretty epic (they follow the books pretty good in this season) just don't get to attached to anyone!!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Helps overcome signal loss between rv coach and park internet tower.  Second USB tail on power cord provides extra power to antenna.  It serves my purpose well.

0743455967|1.0|I didn't know stephen king had such a filthy mouth or I would never have ordered this book.  If you don't want your young people to read nasty words, don't buy this book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Although I find t very disturbing that some (or most) of my favorite characters die in this I still can not get enough!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It seemed a litlle long to develop the plot and characters.  Then it was over in 5 pages.  Easy to read as Grisham always is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even with hundreds of channels to chose from it's hard to find things to watch.  We look forward to watching this.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a really well written account into what went into the taking down of OBL. I enjoyed all the information as well as the action that went into finding OBL.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Just one of those quirky movies filled with incredibly interesting characters.  The cast is terrific and really delivers.  I would watch it again just to see what I missed the first time around.
B00003CXWV|3.0|Just ok,  was very predictable, so so story line.  Good quality and price, have definetly seen Johnny in better perfomances

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a very well written, true story, about the life of an American sniper. It goes into the emotional drive to be the best and the emotional divide between the job and the family. Very good read.
0062082353|5.0|Outstanding &#34;read&#34; on the life of a patriot with unique abilities, the perseverance to achieve excellence, and the heart of a lion.  It was a tragedy that we lost him after he had done so much for his country, and then after coming home, when he was reaching out to help our returning veterans who were having difficulty in adjusting to their circumstances which were brought on my their experiences in the defense of our way of life.
B005HSL626|5.0|Both of my kids like this game and both want to play it at the same time and they really love it
B001BANK32|5.0|The thing I love about King books and this one Included is you never have to worry about important details being brushed off or left unsaid. You know the dynamics of characters and the ins and outs of the story. I would recommend this book highly to people who are new to Stephen King 's literary work. On  thing to keep in mind reading King is the first half of the book may seem drab and drawn out but once you get past that first initial section hold on to your seat your in for the ride of your life.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Finally someone is not afraid to discuss the truth of mental illness. So many people struggle everyday with mental illness but society does not approve of these discussions. Hopefully this book will bring more awareness and start an important conversation throughout America about mental illness.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|This is one of those creeper albums.  On first listen, it's ok.  On the next, it's better.  Eventually, you realize it's playing on repeat and you're singing along.  Then, no music is playing and you're singing to it in your head. Then you realize she's a genius and you can't believe you ever thought the album was just meh. Then while you are writing this review you decide to  listen to it again.<br /><br />Seriously, if I don't stop singing 'super super super super suicidal' I'm going to come home one day to a misguided intervention.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|You move your kindle in the direction that you want to jet off to I love jetting around in a science lab.

0920236251|5.0|These 3&#34; mini books will be the party favor at my daughter's paper bag princess themed birthday party. So cute - wish more publishers would try this.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Don't get me wrong this great and works like it says, but it feels like cheap plastic, it looks cheap and was not for me.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Positive:Exciting, attention holding , thought provoking intelligence<br /><br />Negative: Not fond of ghost writing<br />  too much formula writing<br /><br />a typo or two
B008JGSM6G|2.0|When I play I find that I hurt my fingers as I am trying to connect the dots together that is why I gave this 2 stars
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Being the geek that I am, I was so excited to get this...and not disappointed! It's very cool (cooler even than bow ties, dare I say) because it looks authentic, and it just makes it better that it doubles as a pen/UV pen! Obviously it's not super expensive, so it is light plastic, but I'm not complaining, as I will definitely take care of it.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Awesome sound effects!<br />-Pen<br />-UV pen<br />-Easy to use<br />-Item as described<br />-Comes with batteries<br />-Looks like the Doctor's<br />-It's a SONIC SCREWDRIVER<br /><br />CONS<br />-The UV tip fits kind of loosely, I feel like it's going to fall off (though I don't know if that's true for all of them or just the one I got)<br />-Again, the plastic looks kind of cheap, but it's nothing I didn't expect<br /><br />Overall, the Doctor Who fangirl in me-as well as the online shopper-was very pleased with this!
B007T967X4|5.0|Great and fun app! Great for learners!! Like a video game that teaches notes on musical staff. Both of my daughters LOVE this game (ages 11 and 8)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Positive: An honest attempt to create belief<br /><br />Negative: Attempt to cross the boundary or devise a boundary between physical and supernatural by brain anatomy.<br />  The writer's credentials were enough.

B00003CX5P|3.0|Yeah,yeah....I say its ok and should fans look at it? YES!!! This film shows you the persona of young Anakin Skywalker on how he was not born evil,the dreams he had and his mature wits. I likes young Obi-Wan Kenobi lol,he was interesting and you get to meet his master and mentor!!! Its not a bad movie and its a MUST OWN.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Positive: One could feel the people's emotion<br />  An excellent story line<br />  Very well written<br /><br />Negative: Could have included more of the related political activities
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|You try to earn money to buy another rollercoster for the game because they need more customers. The more customers, the more the love, the more the money
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think they should add redstone and the neder portal should be more good than that and flynt and steal should make fire but it's fine
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! The father and son relationship was beautiful. The ending when he realized that his mother was along for much of the journey was such a heartfelt moment.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Love this movie, the best I am extremely happy with this movie. The best phantom of the opera yet . Must see this movie.

B009WGWRW2|3.0|I love Dilbert, it is a very good product, however I was expection to see more Dilbert strips and quotes in it
B007VUA7VO|1.0|I downloaded this app and the same night set it to calibrate for my device. In the morning my battery was at 17%. I plugged it in to charge and it took twice as long as it usually does to charge to 100%. I then noticed that throughout the day as I used it my battery was running out quickly. Then I read some of the reviews. I immediately deleted the app and my battery life has returned back to normal.

B008EQIEWS|4.0|Good movie for people who like this type of movie. Cllash of theTitans was a little more in depth  than this one.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|this DVD disc will play if I insert it in my Mac computer or in a regular DVD player? I cannot do streaming or downloads.<br /><br />I have really enjoyed all the Harry Potter movies, seen them all and have all the DVDs except this one. I really want it but I am not willing to buy any of the UltraViolet products.<br /><br />My rating is for the movie only... not the &#34;product.&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of my very favorite games, keeps your mind active. I recommend this to anyone that wants to be challenged.

B005M2A4DE|5.0|This is the first blu-ray and was nore enjoyable than the other series that I have purchases, Throughly enjoy Dr Who.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I saw it first  in a graduate class and fell in love with the characters.  I am now 70 (!!) and am delighted to say that I still get  kick of out the dynamics of this relationship and ensuing adventures. Two stellar performances.I will be viewing this often through my next 20 years.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely a must have for every true Christian. Easy to use and readily accessible whenever you need it. Recommended to all.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is a fun game with a good challenge. And the plus is that is is free. I will try iTree games again.
B000MVIAUY|5.0|While I was unable to find a reasonably priced DVD version of season 2, I did manage to get a great price on the Instant Video version and I'm so glad I bought it.  Season two sees a lot of changes for the Winchesters, they face some hardships but also learn to be brothers again.  Lots of great episodes that will make you laugh, cry, and be afraid to turn the lights out at night.  Just a great show all around.  Now... for the other six seasons.  Hah.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game, but you can't make stone stairs which I hate, in the next update make sure you can make stone slabs and stairs. This is in survival. Please update this game so we can also make Redstone stuff too. But rather way its an epic game!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|After Emmy's first album , that It was a little wire, with  a lot of layers and layers of her beautiful voice ! Emmy  has recorded an album with the most clear voice in the world , my opinion.<br />I really like the theme, 12 song for each month of the year .My fav is SUMMER WIND.
1423151054|5.0|My daughter is an art/illustration major and loved this set of books!!!Will be sure to buy more books like this.
B009738XXM|4.0|I bought this for my daughters - 11 and 13 - and have come to enjoy it myself.  She's got a good voice and a great pop sound.  I'm always a bit wary when buying something for my kids because our tastes usually don't mesh, but this time they did.  I guess I have to give them kudos for turning me on to her music?  Nah.  :)
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The wife and children had to suffer through four deployments. At least two of them not necessary. I'm afraid the author felt too bulletproof, and that he had some special power over death. Then toward the end, he began to see that was wrong,and decided to try to become a family man. He said that he believed in God, and I feel that he did. Rest In Peace.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I loved this movie.  Rene Zellweger steals the show.  Nicole Kidman, and Jude Law both did a very good job, but it is Rene's movie.  This is one that you can watch and enjoy with the entire family.  It has just enough facts intermingled with fiction to make it interesting to a wide audience.  Set in the Civil War, the movie follows the lives of a soldier that is wounded and deserts to go back to the love of his life, a city girl that follows her father to the country only to be abandoned when he dies suddenly, and the country girl that saves thems both long enough complete their love story.  Sad is short bursts, but happy in the long run.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I love this movie, one that I've watched over many times. Very funny at times, but a touching love story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just Love his stories and love that area. My annual vacation spot. Makes the story even better to read
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I liked a couple of the songs on this CD and grew to like the others.  I enjoy listening to it.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I have long been a fan of both Tommy Lee Jones, and Meryl Streep, but they both made a poor selection with this one.  It has very predictable plot, and it's neither sad, nor funny.  Sorry guys, but this is one that I choose not to see again, or add to my collection.
1449410243|3.0|Only one section made me laugh out loud, as compared to &#34;How to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth&#34; which was more diverse I guess and sillier. I love cats and thought this would be funnier.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Fun to take Facebook with me on the road. Had no problem reading posts, or writing them on this program.
B001JRB16U|5.0|i bought this for my granddaughter to watch before we took her to see the stage show  She loved it, leaned the songs.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Now I know why it won the Academy Award.  This is a well written, acted, and directed movie.  I know they took some artistic liberties with the facts, but still a very good movie.
0385537816|3.0|Love the books but, I will be returning the hard copies since the pages look terrible! Some of the pages are longer than others so they look very jagged. I was going to give as a gift. Not gonna happen...very disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think this show to be brilliant!  I LOVE period pieces though so I am kinda biased.  The casting is great, and every show ends with you wanting more. Season 3 ends a heartbreaker. I really don't want to wait for season 4 but alas....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although the premise is simple, the feelings evoked by the thought processes of the narrator are visceral.  It is disturbing, but mesmerizing.  I have read more subtle and well written books, but none that have made me cry at the harshness of life and the small gestures of kindness that surrounded the death of Rue.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really kept me going and I was shocked at the ending but I like that about the book.  I was so sure I knew what was really going on only to find out I did not at all.  very clever, turned pages fast and looked forward to the next read.  very good characters, life of a marriage in the first 5 yrs.( we all think we are a little crazy) and personalities in families.. loved it.  would recommend to friends.  looking forward to our Book Club discussion tonight.  Enjoy!
1250012570|5.0|This book y'all...THIS BOOK! Writing reviews for book you love should be easy, but it never is. And I LOVED this book. Like, full on madly, completely, obsessively in love with this book. So in love that I'm not sure I have the right words to express why I love it so much. But, since this is a review, and reviews require things like words and sentences (hopefully coherent ones), I will do my best...here are some words: this book wrecked my heart in the most mother-effing beautiful way!<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor & Park is about two misfit sixteen year olds in 1986 who find each other, find first love, find great music, and even find a bit of themselves. Park, the half-Korean boy in the funky t-shirts, feels invisible, while Eleanor, the girl with the big red hair and wacky outfits, is impossible to ignore. These two come from vastly different homes and families, but they bond over comic books, music, and a shared sense of humor. First love hits them hard, but the fall is worth it.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is YA contemporary at its very best! Rainbow Rowell has crafted something truly spectacular and special. Everything about this book is unforgettable: the characters, the romance, the writing, the way you will feel after finishing it. I wish I could erase this book from my memory simply so I could have the sheer pleasure of reading it for the first time again. It is THAT heart-achingly, heart-breakingly, heartbeat-skippingly good (so good I have to make up words to describe it!).<br /><br />Eleanor & Park doesn't start with a bang or end on an explosive note, it isn't loud or in your face, it doesn't take you to a precipice and drop you over the edge or hurl you even higher. It doesn't need to. The beauty is in its subtlety, in its slow build, reminiscent of the songs Eleanor and Park love so much. This isn't the type of book to gobble up quickly, it deserves to be savored, every page tasted and appreciated. Rowell writes with an addicting humor, unabashed honesty, and a pitch-perfect YA voice that feels timeless. This isn't a sweet and simple love story; the story has hard edges, painful blows, and deals with some heavy stuff, but Rowell delivers and explores these things with finesse and eloquence.<br /><br />At the heart of this book is its main characters, Eleanor and Park. These are two of the best written YA characters I have ever met. They feel so real, like they have to exist somewhere and I could someday happen to sit next to one of them on the bus or be standing behind them in a check-out line. I'm not sure I can choose a favorite, I love them both so much and connected with each of them. They are both just so breathtaking, as individuals and as a pair. Park, with his kind soul, funky t-shirts, and sweet martial art moves, is endearingly charming. And Eleanor, with her sharp wit, courage, and unfailing honest, is a breath of fresh YA air. But I think what I love most about these two, is how they love each other, how they see each other.<br /><br />The romance between Eleanor and Park is so wonderfully executed. It's soft and sexy, sweet and passionate, miraculous and terrifying, at times heart-wrenching (and heart-wrecking), but impossible to turn away from. First love can be insanely intense, all consuming, can feel like the end of the world and just the beginning all at the same time, and the romance between these two is no different. The difference between this YA relationship and other YA relationships that make us roll our eyes or scream in frustration (the insta-loves, the scary obsessive loves, the we-fall-in-love-and-suddenly-become-personality-less loves), is that this love isn't forced, it isn't romanticized for the sake of making readers swoon. It's just real and believable and addicting and, for the few hours it takes you to read this book, it feels like the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: Eleanor and Park feel like they have become a part of me; they're in my heart, have been on my mind since I finished the book, and I hope they never leave me. Eleanor & Park has easily made its way into my top favorite books of 2013 and  I will be singing its praises fo'evah! A definite must read...seriously, read it, love it, then come talk to me about it!art, have been on my mind since I finished the book, and I hope they never leave me. Eleanor & Park has easily made its way into my top favorite books of 2013 and  I will be singing its praises fo'evah!

B005HED11Y|5.0|This season features some of the best Star Trek original series episodes of all time.  They look fantastic since they have been remastered, especially the scenes featuring external views of the Enterprise, planets and space battles.
0062238868|5.0|Very good book, but weird knowing that the author had been killed.  He had a tough go at it with his personal life but was tough enough to get around it. Seemed like a great guy, so sad to lose him, after all he went through in Iraq.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|Played first two coasters OK. Then froze kindle. I had to hard reboot. then I deleted it for good. Makes me wonder if UBI even tested it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app. I love the breakdown. I would recommend this app to everyone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It doesn't get any better than classic Star Trek episodes, and they look even better now that they have been remastered.  The space/battle scenes and external shots of the Enterprise look fantastic!  Some of the best ever episodes with Kirk and the Enterprise crew are featured in this season.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Pornographic reading gets boring real quick. Reads like a teenage novel, and that is most likely its intended audience. The graphic details can be tantalizing, but some quickly slide into revulsion.
030758836X|3.0|Once I started reading this book, it really sucked me in. I had to know what happened. Without totally giving away the ending, let me just say I was very disappointed with how this book turned out. The book is a bit unbelievable to begin with,  but to basically just let evil win at the end, it left me feeling somewhat dirty, if that makes any sense. It is still a fast read and fairly well-written. Read it only if you must. The ending was very unsatisfying.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this whole series. This final book did not disappoint. I am so sad that it is over. I am not sure I have ever felt this way about any book I have read.
0345803485|5.0|Really really loved reading this book. Life isn't perfect so I really enjoys that his character was so flawed.  There r people in this world  that have suffered a lot and carry with them a lot of pain. Maybe they can find a place of peace in this world just like this character did. Love romance. Love even better the flaw characters in these modern romance novels. Love seeing his growth. Love this book so much I want the vintage 3 in one edition. Thanx to E L James for writing that book. Loved it. Obsess is more the word to describe how I feel about it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this  game keeps me occupied for hours.  i don't like how hard it is to earn diamonds, but still fun.
B007QB5BPA|5.0|American Sniper is the real thing.  Chris pulls no punches, he tells you what it's like to do the job you were trained to do!  Great book down to earth reading. For every military person this should be mandatory reading.  Chris Kyle was the real deal!
1469220660|5.0|I Love the Crossfire series. What a page turner. Juicy romance and suspense. Can't wait for the next book to come out!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. I like that that the characters talk. Very good graphics. A lot of things to do. Keeps your interest.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Love this show. Fantastic story and beautiful to look at. Love that they are going on location and we get to see all of these beautiful places for ourselves. Several stories going on at once so you have to pay attention but all wonderfully told. Can't wait for Season 3.
0307887448|5.0|As always, the standard warning: I am going to relentlessly spoil this book.<br /><br />Oh, what a joy it is to be able to write a glowing review.<br /><br />(First, a note. I am going to refer to the main character as Wade throughout this review. This is not the name he uses for most of this novel, as it takes place within the virtual reality of the OASIS and everyone within uses a cyber-pseudonym. However, &#34;Parzival&#34; is not a name I care to spell reliably and the end of the novel leads me to believe it is a more fitting one than his screenname.)<br /><br />My initial description to others of this book to others was that it was like a transcript of Roald Dahl and Neal Stephenson getting together over beers in 1989 to discuss the works of Kurt Vonnegut (or, less opaquely, what would happen if Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Snow Crash had a love child atop a pile of Atari games). Aside from Stephenson, all these references are so plain as to be spray painted on the side of a starship (no, really, Wade names a spaceship the Vonnegut).<br /><br />The execution of the premise is inspired, even if the premise itself is baldly derivative. In the not too distant future (2044), humanity has ground to a halt owing to peak oil. Vehicles - aside from those with solar panels - are worse than useless. The world is a desolate and overcrowded place. Wade lives in a stacked trailer (with so little living space and such rampant poverty, trailers are stacked and connected with rickety girders) with his indifferent aunt who steals from him whenever possible. He is eighteen and well-versed in the only world that matters, the OASIS, a virtual reality that almost everyone alive is connected to most of the time. Even though he is poor, surviving entirely by finding and fixing computer equipment, he always makes sure to have a reliable connection to the OASIS.<br /><br />The creator of the OASIS, James Donovan Halliday, died years prior after outlining in his will that the first person to find an Easter egg in the game will inherit the entire OASIS and all the goes along with it. This is less a matter of finding a needle in a haystack as finding a needle in Russia, since there are so many worlds in multiple zones in the OASIS. No keys are found in the intervening years and most of the smatterers have given up the search. The only clues anyone has are the video will and the 1980s-soaked diary he left behind, both of which become matters of no minor obsession among egg hunters, soon shortened to the portmanteau &#34;gunters&#34;, and the villains of the book, Innovative Online Industries, a corporation that wishes to seize control of the OASIS and curtail its freedom for profit. These villains, called the Sixers (or Sux0rz) by the gunters, operate identical avatars and have all possible advantages within the OASIS, since they have the collective wealth and knowledge of their corporate masters.<br /><br />I thought Cline's devices to avoid dealing with what a future world would be like were clever. There's no need to explore that dystopia outside because they have the best video game even created at their fingertips, free to play. There is no need for Cline to make up any history beyond the early 2000s, since everyone we care about is fixated on the minutiae of the 1980s. If you are disinterested with either video games (the vast majority of this novel) or 1980s culture, you would be best advised to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Some of the physics of the OASIS were grand, such as the fact that different worlds allow and prevent abilities. Your ninetieth level wizard is going to be nearly useless in a technology only zone, your Firefly-class spaceship is going to conk out on the edges of a magic only zone and need to be towed back by a price-gouging mage in a psychic bubble. As in our world, virtual loot and gold is worth real money, though it is clear that Wade and the other gunters value the currency of the OASIS far more than legal tender(it can be used to buy products in the real world). I appreciate that there are rare artifacts that are worth the equivalent of millions of dollars and which are far too powerful given that they were inserted into the OASIS when it was just a game. I love the idea of online schools, something that is already peeking into our reality, as a means to combat social anxiety and inequity (of course, instead of people obsessing over who has the coolest new shoes, it is about who has the shiniest accessories for their avatar). I like that an avatar dying still has consequences, as this means the player must start again from level one with none of their loot. Otherwise, it would be only too easy to drown the enemy beneath digital corpses and regenerate at full power.<br /><br />It is not that some of the seams are still not visible in the final product. I can see where Cline backed his characters into corners and then had to revise the book to get them out again. I can detect where one of his beta readers must have said, &#34;Well, this doesn't make much sense.&#34; Sections of the novel seem more like the descriptions of action being seen in a movie than as if the characters are immersed in it; it is showing, not telling. On the other hand, these characters are jacked into a virtual reality, avoiding the horrors of their actual reality, so this might be less laziness than a stylistic trick. Wade is not used to a world that doesn't involve a screen and haptic gloves. The overall experience is such a delight that I am inclined to be forgiving.<br /><br />This book doesn't provide many surprises. If you do not understand by the tenth page that Wade is going to win in the end and learn an important lesson about love and friendship after triumphing over adversity, you clearly grew up in a very different culture than I did. At the very least, you haven't seen many 80s movies (or Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory), which provide the moral backbone of this book. But knowing theinevitable destination doesn't detract from enjoying the scenery on the way, and it is some pretty scenery. This is a book rife with space battles, eighties music, magic, mazes, puzzles, comic books, giant robots, and pretty much every fandom worth knowing. I am a child of the eighties in a literal way, but I cannot promise to have understood all (or likely many) of the allusions and references. Thankfully, these tend not to be subtle. This is, after all, an entire virtual reality made by an eighties geek with an Easter egg hunt predicated on his obsession. You may not get the clues before Wade does, but it does not really matter. This is an adventure novel, not a mystery.<br /><br />One thing that struck me as an afterthought (but which undoubtedly struck dozens of studio execs immediately) is that this book is, despite its filmic nature, downright unfilmable. It is not that the visuals wouldn't lend themselves to being on celluloid. As I've said, this is some pretty scenery and I'd love to see a three dimensional interpretation of it. The issue is exclusively one of licensing. Cline's characters inhabit a world obsessed with the 1980s and not a one of them is shy about namedropping, buying, waving about, or outright reenacting intellectual property. There is a battle between mechas of multiple studios, the lawyers of which would undoubtedly look askance at seeing them all fight in a movie. There are sections of the book where the gunters play a game consisting of perfectly acting out character's parts in movies, down to the gestures and with whom they are interacting. I suppose one could just make near copies of the properties mentioned to avoid paying out tens of billions for the rights, but it seems to defeat the purpose of the exercise. There is a reason characters in movies tend to either drink prop brands or deal in product placement.<br /><br />That being said, the movie is already stated to be in development.
0765322889|2.0|While his books get progressively better, this one felt like i was reading anime fan-fiction. Everyone seems capable of army-devouring super magic (which makes it seem not that special at all). Characters constantly talk about how readings of some other character's power level is over 9000(i write this as a joke but i'm not laughing, nor do i mean this isn't true. it is.) Nothing of the lore or the world is ever explained at the appropriate times, which doesn't lend credence to a sense of mystery, it just makes things really irritating. The characters are bland, and physically description-less. Sometimes it will just throw in 'he's black' and then continue on as if that's enough to manifest a character in a literary story, the color of his skin?...<br /><br />I got the most enjoyment reading about Paran, which is ironic because in comparison to the other POV's, not a lot happens to him. But that's what actually made his story feel like an authentic fantasy, and NOT anime fan fiction where some character is blowing up mountains, etc.<br />One of the most awful fantasies I've ever read (but like i said, the books get better).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very exciting and well written. Would recommend to anyone that like a lot of action and excitement in a book to read this. Quite compelling.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Still love it! Can't wait to see where they'll take the story. Oddly slow at getting new episodes so for Instant Video customers, you'll have to be patient.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked this book.  It rang true (even though it's fiction), and woke me up a little more showing me how lucky my life has been.  This author did a great job writing it.
0316187216|4.0|If you're a Nine-Fingers fan like me, you better have around $20 for this book. He makes one hell of an appearance, and the wild wild West setting, especially in a fantasy genre, was refreshing. The oddness of some of the book reminded me a little of China Meiville's Bas Lag universe.<br /><br />Most of the characters from the First Law trilogy are completely abandoned however, and you get a slew of new faces. While not being as strong as the former ones, they were still enjoyable to read about. Although the fact that Logan is in the story carried it quite a lot.<br /><br />Great humor, i laughed quite a bit. Im not giving it 5 stars however because a lot of cliche and recurring, sort of 'character is about to die/ something bad is about to happen, and some other character arrives at the last minute to save the day!' While this cliche is fine if it happens once or twice in a book, it happened in this one about 6 goddamn times. The number is actually probably higher, i just don't recall every occasion. But it was enough to really irritate me and make the writing seem somewhat weak in this regard.<br /><br />Otherwise a good read.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I love the game, but it keeps making me wait 15 minutes to keep playing through the levels.  I did pay 99 cents for more time, but it was a total waste.  Maybe 5 extra minutes.
B009GX6600|5.0|Still love NCIS. It got a little dull last year but they picked it up a bit this season. Glad Ducky's still with us. (Knocking on wood so I don't jinx it!)
B005COO1X6|5.0|Classic Stephen King!  I wish he had kept me in suspense a tad bit longer!!  Classic gory King though & leaves you to your own imagination as to just what exactly they were dealing with. Loved it!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I like to have games on my kindle for the times I am away from home.  I don't like games that require an internet connection.  I don't like using unsecure connections.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Sofia is 8 years old. She is very charming little girl and<br />after watching this DVD with my girls I can atest that as old as 7.5 will totally enjoy it. It has some values in it and it teaches you kindness and all that so it is good and different of typical<br />scare the shorts of little kids with some super scary vilans type of deal. So this is good. It has other princess characters in it.. Cindy being one of htem, there good faires from Aurora story etc..<br />Story is good, action flows nicely, graphics are awsome. Easy to watch and very enjoyable. The better if you get it with the costume and amulet and tiara but not the one that is included with this dvd as those are jsut booklet style fold and make it yourself things with stickers and not real deal. Disney issued a very short series of Costumes and accessories but they are already sold out so hard to find but the DVD iteself is really and totally worth of buying.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|Still love Modern Family! I think it's just one of those magic shows that just works all the way around. Great writing, perfect casting and consistently hilarious.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is my third time reading this. It is the best one. I do enjoy the first part of the book better than the movie. I have yet to see the second part so we shall see.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|This is not really a flashlight, Just makes your screen light up and you can change the color. I thought I would get the app that Iphones have.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I feel like these are real people that I actually know.  one of the best series i have ever watched.  love it
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Selections are varied and beautifully executed.  Saw &#34;Bocelli at Portofino&#34; on PBS after listening to the CD and appreciated the music even more.
B007A04NYM|2.0|A few good songs, but overall not a keeper for me. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)
B00A3T5CGU|2.0|This app is of no help unless you have internet connection on the road. I will not dowload any more map apps.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|As you can see this book is AWESOME.  The first chapter of the book is AWESOME. I love this book.
088708155X|3.0|i didn't think it would be so small, it's smaller than a board book.  There was no indication of that in the description.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app u can oust things and read other things that other people have posted! Is so awesome!!!!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful tale of a couples relationship, falling in love, but are separated.<br />How they reconnect, and the man's love is so strong for her, he overcomes numerous  obstacles to prove it until the very end.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I liked the strength of bolts character.he was as faithful to his convictions as the story unfolded.l felt that his humble attitude was what Beth fell in love with.I  liked the end because I was not sure if t bolt survived.l was pleased that he did.<br />I have loved all of Mr. Sparks books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enjoyed the book.  Could not put it down.  Found the writing and experience very well done.  Disliked the ending.  Would have rated it higher except for the ending.<br /><br />I will look forward to the authors next novel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Some friends recommended this show to us- we love it. It's addicting. It's a very clean show, bar a scene in the first episode (of the first season) where two men kiss. I could have done without that. Otherwise, it's a very good show and I love how it's primarily from the servants' point of view.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Showed courage and acceptance and how to live a good life!  Struggles and acts of kindness.  Fear and perseverence.  A good read recommend for young people and adults!
B00AOB3FES|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is not my favorite Disney movie but I enjoy sharing good clean movies with our children.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite movies. I didn't know the &#34;who it is&#34; until the very end. The movie had me on the edge of my seat. Completely emotional and I first saw it because Amanda Seyfried is in it. So that's just another plus to the movie. I thoroughly love it. Far better then the other fairy tale remakes coming out I think.
1401322786|3.0|A friend gave me this book for my birthday. I really love the cover. I’ve read so many great reviews, which describe the book as a “prose”. I’ve never heard of that terminology before, though now that I’ve read it, I know what they mean. I don’t particularly care for this style of writing. The story started off a little bit boring to me, though it ended a lot better.
1616550414|5.0|Item was shipped immediately! Couldn't' be happier. Illustrations inside are amazing, a definite must for any Zelda fan, I highly recommended this book.
0062238868|5.0|Amazing book ! What a great patriot and what a great loss, this book takes on an even greater meaning knowing Chris is no longer with us :(
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I LOVE this movie. The whole saga is wonderful, but I think this one is one of my favorites of the saga. The kiss with Bella and Jacob was SO hot and well worth waiting for. I honestly would have chosen the other way though...:) Positively suspenseful, romantic and the fighting scene was great too.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|This was a good book, but compared to the other 3 it isn't nearly as good. It took me a lot longer to get through because  it didn't grab me the same way. It was good and explained a , but not to the same degree
0062082353|5.0|Excellent narrative from one of our great American heroes.  Spouses insight was very enlightening and added greatly in a real personal way.  Well written and documented.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Cute movie. Nothing to write home about. It's your typical cute love story. If you are looking for a nice movie with a typical love plot, this is for you. It's a good watch if you are having a bad day and need something to make you smile but not think. Not a bad movie just not great.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Loved this! It was moving to find out why Jacob wanted Bella for so long and why he was drawn to her. The honeymoon part was cute too. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator. Perfect for doing my basic math homework. Big numbers are easy to see. It was a great find. Thank you for the quick access to this calculator.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this book and other two books too wish there were more to read. The best trilogy I have read so far I highly recommend these books
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|I hadn't seen it a while. It was very good. Came quickly. Was a gift for my son. He was crazy about it.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I love this show and i love that i can watch it when ever i want now absolutely amazing :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome it also has very very awesome graphics it just had graphics on the home picture it is just completely awesome.
B0086449YA|5.0|Such an array of instruments used in this 2 disc cd.  Well worth purchasing.  I consider it a must have for all Mark Knopfler lovers.  You will hear jazz, blues, sounds of Scotland and Ireland.  Beautiful arrangements.  A couple of my favorites are Hot or What and I used to Could.  I listen to this everyday coming to or leaving work. Enjoy!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever!! Absolutely loved it! Author did an incredibly amazing job putting a picture in my head! Love  it!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show and i love that i can watch it when ever i want now absolutely amazing :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|a lot of puzzles for a free game. it really keeps me interested and want to continue playing. on a daily basis.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|the holmes and watson characters, to me, are very similar to the original characters.  downey does a great job of bring the broken genius to the screen.
B00422LESO|3.0|I thought I'd like it a lot more after reading the thumbnail.  It is an okay idea, but not executed very well.  The author could use a couple more workshops or a better editor!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I love this show and i love that i can watch it when ever i want now absolutely amazing :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A story line that had both suspense and romance, it was a quick read that was laid back and easy to follow and hard to put down!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|iT'S EVERYTHING I EXPECTED.  IT WAS SIMPLY PLUG IN AND GO.  IT GAVE ME THE MOBILITY AND CONVENIENCE I WANTED.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Such a cute movie! This film has so many laugh at loud moments and I couldn't help but smile. JT and Mila have great chemistry and I'd mos def. recommend this for your collection.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Played quite a few of these.  This is one of the better versions of Mahjong available on Amazon.  We have a few other 247 games; like all of them so far. Don't expect that to change.
B003O86FMW|5.0|just getting into the second installment and am loving the dynamic of the 'president' and his minions in the continuing story of living in a distorted world
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the calculator because it's easy to use with the size and all. I recommend. it to all especially the vision impaired.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|This was filmed over a couple (maybe three) consecutive days in Paris in 1979.  Consequently, the film crew did not capture a handful of songs which do appear on the live album. Fortunately for us, it did capture other songs which were strangely omitted from the album (like Goodbye Stranger, for instance).<br /><br />Poor Bob Siebenberg is hardly featured (the crew could not find many open shots through his cymbals), and Dougie Thompson is featured on some songs and not at all in others.  The other three members and frontmen/singers are well captured and the editing is as thoughtful as I've ever seen from a concert show.<br /><br />The audio is pristine. The bass might be slightly over emphasized for my taste (and I'm a great fan of low end in general and of the instrument in particular) but that is probably because I was listening on professional equipment and the audio must have been mixed for the average home theater listening environment.  I switched to the TV and home theater speakers for the last three songs and the audio balance required no EQ-ing whatsoever.  I can't say I fault the production for this decision; it makes sense.<br /><br />The video quality varies: it's a film transfer obviously, and the lighting was concert lighting in 1979, but overall, shots are clear and well framed. Don't expect 4K quality (or UHD as it's going to be called) or even HD quality visuals, but that's not the point here.<br /><br />The missing songs are included in this disc with accompanying &#34;videos&#34; (just a bunch of graphics stringed together), but it's a nice touch nonetheless, for those who might not have had the Live Album in the first place.<br /><br />At the end of the show are stills of the band members, and a brief update with links to their personal websites for biographies.  Also a nice touch.<br /><br />Highly recommended, for Supertramp fans of course, but also for fans of just a couple of their songs or of beautiful music, simply put. I wonder what tookthem so long to green light this project and release it.
B001992NUQ|5.0|My husband and I have seen this movie before and we love it!!!  He wanted the anniversary edition on blu-ray so I this was his Christmas present.  The DVD works great and if you haven't seen the movie---get it!!!  This movie has an awesome twist that will knock you out!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|a revival of enthusiasm for the classics. The written descriptions of the times and the people truly make Les Mis a historical piece as well as entertaining reading.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed the romantic story and celebrate the emergence of &#34;mommy porn&#34;, girl power! I would not have picked up the book if not for my book club assignment, but I'm glad I did, I feel like I'm more in the know in pop culture.
2218951983|5.0|Every kid I know who learned French (and learned it properly) learned with this book.  It is the equivalent of sit-ups and push-ups and stair-master exercises for the French language: it works and builds up your core.  Everything else is a bit of grammar and a lot of vocabulary.<br /><br />Learn to conjugate regular and irregular verbs, and basically you're teaching yourself to teach yourself French.<br /><br />Most highly recommended.
0060775858|5.0|There is a reason books become classics and Goodnight Moon is no exception to this rule.  I love that the Grandma tucks the little rabbit in.  It is great for us when Mom and Dad are on a date night.  Lovely illustrations and just enough words for a young child, but not talking down.
B004X4QW42|4.0|Nice plot, was able to follow the story line.  Due to sub-titling, I had to watch the movie twice to fully appreciate the history of Ip Man.
141694740X|5.0|This book has given me so many awesome quotes!! It helps put your man-problems in perspective. Read under normal circumstances, and it's the perkiest cheerleader here to over-inflate your self-esteem, but administered when needed, it's a blast to read! I lent it to a girl friend when she was going through a particularly bad breakup, I never got it back but it's in better hands now...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series...and really feel like they are part of my world....I can't wait to see the next show!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I am not ashamed to admit I love Taylor Swift. She is extremely talented as a singer and a song writer. This album is fun to listen to and I love that I got it at a great price! Thank you amazon.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|One of the best &#34;cops and robbers&#34; movies ever! Totally engrossing , superbly acted and with an end both predictable morally but disappointingly tragic for Deniro, who was in his element!
1591840562|3.0|Sometimes what you need is a spark to get going, this book does that, and that's about it. Guides can be found online too, try your local SBA.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an awesome book. Just goes to show you that God is our help in our every need. He gives us joy in the morning. I love Nicholas Sparks books.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, I really did.  It is crass and that usually doesn't bother me. Maybe it is the fact that there is a cute, cuddly teddy bear saying very not cute and cuddly things. It wasn't horrible, but I am not someone that will probably watch this more than once.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show has something for everyone.  Great cast, great stories, great characters that continually grow and develop.  I love this show!!
0060899220|4.0|Bourdain has an interesting life, this is an autobiography of his ascent. I am not inspired to take the same route but it was fun to read anyway.
1451683405|4.0|I find this book to be a helpful jumping off point for thinking about free will.  He makes his points in a clear, simple way.  For example, \\"We can pursue any line of thought we want--but our choice is the product of prior events that we did not bring into being.\\" What I got out of the book is that we believe we are choosing, but the actions we are choosing from have already been determined, as has what we will like or not like. That doesn't mean that over time, as we expose ourselves to other influences, our behavior won't change. We are in transition, not written in stone.<br />It's hard to stop thinking of oneself as having free will.  It's a habit.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|So as someone from Pittsburgh (where this movie was filmed) I think I was required to see this movie. It is great to pick out all the places around town I could find. This is by far my favorite movie of the series. Great action, great special effects. At the end one can't help but feel like it was set up for someone else to bring out the next phase with Robin? Who knows, but I am sure if they do...I will watch.
B0079R8KO0|2.0|I received the Kindle Fire as a gift.  I like that it has internet access, etc.  I loved my kindle but needed the upgrade.  It had a black leather cover.  Very good quality.  The Marware Vibe Case Cover is structurally sound, just not the same quality aesthetically as the black leather Kindle cover made by Amazon.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|You continually have to pond and pound on objects over and over including the hint button...nothing happens. graphics and sound are great. but G5 really dropped the ball on this one. they need to correct the sensitive when you are trying to find the hidden objects. Inventory bar needs to be raised so you can see what you have. Could be an awesome game. Definitely needs some attention by G5. Please fix soon.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game to play passes the time cc away.  Even my kids love I t.  Wish you could buy more track with coins instead rd of gems.
B001CNMDUO|4.0|I have become a huge fan of all things Jason Statham.  He always plays interesting characters with action packed fight scenes. This movie was fun to watch!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|It showed that when the going gets tough the tough get going.  Seems a bit wordy in parts of the story.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Particularly love the La Vien Rose with Edith Piaf --best version I've ever heard. All the other songs are, of course, also great.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always enjoyed Mahjong.  I am not much of a game player but this game is very relaxing for me at times.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Watching this movie in 3D was like seeing a different movie. I saw so much more texture and scenery than in the original. I love Pixar movies and this is one of my favs. I highly recommend seeing this in 3D.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Has great functionality once you get the settings the way you want them. Would recommend this app to avid sudoku fans

B00574P9EQ|5.0|I was introduced to Wimpy Kid movies on New Years Eve. My nieces laughed out loud the entire movie...and so did the adults. I watched my parents laughing to the point of tears. Because she only had one item I felt the need to get her the rest. She was so happy when she opened her present and promptly put on the movie
B005LAII0I|5.0|This wa a awesome movie. to tell you the truth i was a little worried about this film. but i thought that they did a great job. juliet roberts was an excellent evil queen. and the girl who played snow white did a great job. i liked the dwarves that was a good little twist. but all in all they kept true to the story which i liked. oh and nathane lane was hillarious. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0374275637|5.0|The parts I found to be most valuable were those that warned of common decision making<br />mistakes or fallacies.  Many of these are the mistakes we make when we use what Kahneman<br />calls System 1 thinking where we should be using System 2 think.  Roughly this means that<br />we use quick, intuitive, evaluative judgments where we should use slow, calculating,<br />judgments that take into account lists of positives and negatives, possible problems as<br />well as possible benefits, experiences in other similar situations and projects, and so<br />on.<br /><br />Kahneman is a bit of a pessimist, or depending on your point of view, a realist.  He is<br />not the person you want present when you are trying to convince a possible funder that the<br />project will be finished quickly, that it will cost very little, that it will pay for<br />itself, that it will be completed as described and without incident, etc.<br /><br />He is also a proud theory buster, or at least he seems to pride himself on criticizing<br />decisions and proposals that are made by someone who is blinded by a theory, especially a<br />cherished and tightly held theory.<br /><br />Here are some of the decision making fallicies that Kahneman warns us about:<br /><br />- The optimistic fallacy -- It's all too easy to become convinced that a proposed project<br />  can be finished quickly, that it will be finished below cost, and that the finished<br />  project will do everything that the user wants it to do.  As a computer programmer, I<br />  can say: \\"Yes, I've seen that before.\\"<br /><br />- The sunk-cost fallacy -- Once you've put time, effort, money, or other resources into a<br />  project, it is much harder to back out or drop the project, even when it is failing.<br />  Dropping the project means admitting failure; it means acknowledging or accepting your<br />  losses; and it means giving up something in which you have serious ego involvement.<br /><br />- The planning fallacy -- This isone where the decision makers consider only unrealistic,<br />  best case scenarios and where the decision could be much improved by considering other<br />  similar situations and projects (i.e. by taking a outside view). A variety of other<br />  considerations should be made in an attempt to avoid the planning fallacy, for example,<br />  what might go wrong in the future, and how the world (the competition, the user's needs,<br />  etc) might change in the future.<br /><br />One piece of important advice from Kahneman: Learn to use (short) checklists and simple<br />algorithm in your daily decisions.  If nothing else, doing so will encourage you to slow<br />down, to think more methodically, to use objective criteria rather that intuitions and<br />likes or dislikes.  Try to set your cherished views aside and to avoid group think by<br />considering ideas from other sources.  Try to use a check list or set of questions that<br />reveal a small set of objective attributes, then use a simple algorithm (often a straight<br />forward sum is good enough), and finally factor in considerations that are specially to<br />the current project or decision.<br /><br />Over and over Kahneman emphasizes *his* opinion that *expert* opinion and expert judgment<br />is no where near as good as we often believe it is.  We all, experts and non-experts<br />alike, think that our judgment is better than it really is.<br /><br />Kahneman also has a reasonably good discussion about predictability, under what conditions<br />the future *is* predictable, and under what conditions \\"experts\\" can learn enough to be<br />able to make valid predictions.  A rough summary is that (1) the future must not be<br />random; (2) there must be cues and indications from which valid predictions can be made;<br />and (3) the expert must be given the opportunity to learn those cues and what follows from<br />them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it! hate that I have to download it from Amazon and pay for it when I already pay for receiving AMC on my TV. It should be OnDemand for subscription viewers. But, they are terribly greedy to make me pay for it twice.
B00701897I|5.0|I wanted to see this in the theaters, but never got to. I love our 3D TV and this was a good 3D movie. Fun story line and great animation. I recommend this as a family movie.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I thought that this movie was pretty good. i actually thought that kristen stewart did a good job as snow white. i thought that the story was not bad. just didn't imagine snow white as an action adventure story. but it worked out well. the fairy land scenery was amazing it was magestic. and i thought chris hemsworth did a good job as the huntsman. i thought that they explored a little more with that character. usually he is the one to go kill her and sets her free then you don't see him anymore. and charlize theron was an outstanding evil queen she scared me a little she was realistic about her character. and i loved the costumes. the movie was really good. and they kept pretty much true to the story. i didn't like the dwarves as much i don't think they really focused on them that they just threw them in. because it would not be a snow white movie without them. they were okay. i've seen better versions of them mainly the disney version and the mirror mirror version. this was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0054SMID0|5.0|lots of twists and turns, ones that i did not expect. worth the time to watch, i am a matthew mcconaughey fan.

B005WYFLNU|5.0|I bought this for my princess niece and she loves all things girlie. This was right up her alley.  It is nice because she can take it with her in the car and keep busy.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Barbra Streisand's voice on this CD is beautiful.  It is a very relaxing CD and very soothing.  It is different than some of her over CD but very lovely.
B0086700CM|5.0|It engages you and holds your attention because you just keep playing one more game.  One more game.  One more game..... :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show I would like to own them all.  I would recommend this to everybody if you like blood and gore and a good story line.
B005LAII08|5.0|I didn't see Brave in the theaters, but I love Pixar animation. They went above and beyond with this movie...especially in 3D. Great story line that was different than what I was expecting. The animation of the main characters hair alone is awe inspiring. Great movie!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I actually liked playing this game, there have always been small bugs I could overlook, but the last big update made the game so bad it is unplayable. I lost game time progress and actual. money. lookup the forum for this game and reviewtheir bug list before spending too much time or any money in this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the Bible.  It's Holy.  It's a great program for following sermons at Church.  You can email your notes to yourself using it.  Awesome tool.
B009NX409M|5.0|I have always loved this movie, have watched it over and over again.  I just find it very romantic.  You don't have to have explicit scenes to be romantic, sometimes it is better to let the imagination work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it! I doubted my interest in Downton Abbey when my parents began talking about it, but I am hooked.  I couldn't wait to see the season 3 so ordered it on here. Of course, I wasn't disappointed.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Did not want to put the book down!  One of the very best books our book club has read this year.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I love this show! I started watching it in the 2nd season so I was super excited when I saw it on prime instant video. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good creepy story.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Excellent animation and a real inspiraton for young girls to show them that they can be anything they want to be.  They are just as brave as any boy.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I am a child of the 80's so as I watched this in the theater I knew I was going to own it. I knew all the words to the songs. Fun movie with little thought required.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|I am not a die hard on these movies, but do appreciate a good vampire flick. It is pretty good.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|i loved everything about this book. its not only a quick read but the characters are so real and true to life. its not your usual story but its a nice love story. well worth it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you like horses then you will like this. I wish the horses would get their energy back faster but other than that it's great.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|This is not an award winning movie. The plot is week, the acting is not award winning,but it is a fun girls night movies.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I like this, it is a pretty decent flick and lots of action. It is a decent way to spend 2 hours if you like watching cinematic adventures.
1616550414|4.0|This book is awesome and it's a must have for any Zelda fan. I enjoyed the fact that they finally revealed the chronology of the games. The concept art from all the games is amazing. My one complaint is that the entire first part of the book is dedicated to Skyward Sword. I would prefer them going into more detail of the other games as well.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|My son wanted this game. I downloaded it and he played for a few times but it quickly gets to where you have to struggle to go farther. Challenge is fun frustration isn't. This game to soon got to frustration. He has a very logical mind with a serious dose of common sense but this game quickly lost its appeal.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I love absolutely everything about this movie.  The acting, the plot, the cinematography, you name it.  I always feel good after seeing it.  And I always catch something new with each viewing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is such an adorable movie!  So happy I found this movie,  and that my son will get to enjoy this classic time and again!<br /><br />Thank you.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|When I got this app I thought it was going to give me a way to take a photo if someone on The other side of my Kindle Fire HD, but it told me to do what I've been doing. Turning it to face the opposite person. It does let me take videos, and it helps me when my pictures shut down where I can't access them, and other problems. It is helpful, but I suggest not to get it unless you want to take videos. If you need help, create a question on your Amazon account, where other users may help you :)
B00A757EFW|3.0|First let me start by saying I was never a Pac Man junkie. I played in the Arcade once in a while and later when it was available to the game console but it was never my favorite game. It still isn't. I played a few times but find that the guys don't turn quite as quick as they used to but the ghoasts sure do. Playing on a small screen might be some of the middle of the road rating for me as well. If you played on the arcade screen then even a 20inch TV the small 4-6 inch just doesn't hold the action on the same level. At the same time they did keep the game the same. THey didn't add a bunch of unnecessary graphics or change the sounds. This is all good. For those who loved the original and don't mind the little screen this is a perfect app.
0767817729|5.0|This thriller leaves a lasting memory! It is chock full of outstanding actors, the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the stunning surprise ending is memorable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The streaming of the video stalling and buffering and giving me errors is awful. On any browser i use. But the show is great!

B000SEI230|5.0|I love the passion between landon and Jamie and his dedication to her in such short notice I just wish she could have lived to be with him
B002APU580|5.0|When this first came out in the theater, I have to admit, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it.  I only read the cliff notes version of Pride and Prejudice in high school and couldn't remember anything about the story.<br /><br />After this came out, I went on a business trip to Asia and was stuck on a plane for 15 hours.  This was one of the movies I could watch and I swear, after seeing it once, I watched it again two more times before my plane landed.  It's absolutely one of my favorite movies ever!  It's romantic, sweet, funny.<br /><br />I bought the book right away and read that and as soon as I got back to the US, I bought the DVD!  And then when Blu-rays were getting popular, I bought the Blu-ray because I needed it in even better quality.  I've even bought this for a few friends to.<br /><br />It's simply one of the best romance movies out there!  You will love it!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Some of the floors are quite fun. I can't wait for more escape games to come out. Keep them coming!!
B0093ST02E|2.0|Poor movie. Sounded as if they ad libbed the script. Not a good effort for anyone in this film. No value for making it that I saw.  Nudity was pointless.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought it started slow and confusing. Once into it, it was hard to put down. Bravo! I loved it.l.p.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|This case is great for holding the micro cars. Just be aware that it does not come with any cars at all. You have to purchase those separately. (If you have any micro cars, though, this could really help you keep track of them.) The front of the truck can be disconnected to play with. If two boys are in the same room with it, though, keep an eye out, because it's likely to cause fights. It's very popular with little boys. And if your little boy has one and others don't, prepare for trouble. As far as keeping the little cars it holds from getting lost, just be aware that you will need lots of energy to chase after the micro cars and you will have to keep putting them in the case, but they will not stay in the case long if your little boy is typical of most. I spent most of my time this Sunday trying to keep a youngster from misplacing his micro cars because he was willing to have them in the case only long enough to take them out again. And every time I turned around, another boy was trying to steal it from him! So, it's a great toy, but maybe not the best to have around when there's only one toy and more than one boy in the vicinity.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|I like this whole alblum. I sometimes have a hard time enjoying almost a whole alblum but in this case There are only a few songs that I don't absolutely love.

B000SZK41M|5.0|This is a classic action movie with some great humor. Yippee-ki-yay!  The original movie is always the best movie, right?
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This novel is a classic! It is full of twists and turns, keeping you from ever wanting to put it down! It is a tale of infinite love and the measures one will take to save their true love. In a word excellent!
B008602KQI|5.0|I even bought another one to give as a gift. The story line is a fresh one that hasn,t been seen before.
B006VC3LES|4.0|This is not my first choice for a relaxing evening at home, but  the hubby loves it so I bought it for him.  He can watch it in the basement while I watch HGTV or a cooking show on another TV.  This is how we have managed to remain married for over 40 years!
1451624468|1.0|That's the essence of what Lawrence Krauss is saying in \\"A Universe from Nothing.\\" We examine a modern sample of \\"empty\\" space from our universe, calculate particles that annihilate and create themselves, figure in some \\"virtual particles\\" along with an astronomical amount of time and before you know it; Tah-Dah! Here we are. The problem is, he takes a sample of our universe AFTER it is already here. We need a sample from something (or more like \\"nothing\\") BEFORE our universe came into existence; a science that obviously can't be done! You can't take a modern-day sample and say \\"This is what it was like before it existed.\\" The sample Krauss uses isn't from the universe before it was here and so is totally fraudulent. It's like `picking yourself up by your own bootstraps.' Plus having \\"particles and antiparticles that wink in and out of existence\\" requires an explanation; what started this `winking' routine?<br /><br />I must admit, I read his book in just two days and I didn't see anywhere anything of Krauss' \\"empty space\\" being a variable or different \\"nothing\\" within other universes that may have other laws different than ours, thus perhaps requiring a new set of calculations that could \\"rewrite\\" cosmology and its history. Krauss doesn't get into any of this at all. Why then such a title?<br /><br />Krauss says; \\"Our common sense should derive from the universe, rather than vice versa.\\" People, including scientists, see the universe in varying depths of knowledge, understanding and perspective. Krauss' advice would make \\"common sense\\" more opinion-like than ever. Krauss does what many people do, offers a multiple choice and leaves out the \\"none-of-the-above\\" option. (he does this throughout the book, page 172 is just one more example) Common sense isn't either of the options he proposes, it's more like; `coherent logic' `axiomatic.' Krauss refuses to acknowledge \\"nothing\\" is just that; \\"No thing.\\" As soon as you put a little something into it, it is no longer \\"nothing.\\" This is a most basic logic, axiom. Also consider `cause and effect.' If there is truly nothing, there could be no cause or effect. Conversely, since we have either/both cause and effect, `something' had to have always existed (which is where I stand). There's nothing hard about understanding this logic. Yet Krauss insists on sidestepping this into a \\"metaphysical rule\\". Anyway, isn't saying `common sense deriving from the universe' only introducing a new unsubstantiated \\"a priori\\"? I can't help but wonder if Krauss is just building a modern-day equivalent of the Ptolemaic solar system?<br /><br />One pleasant surprise, my copy of the book happens to be the later 2013 edition where Krauss writes a second preface to his preface. (a prepreface?) For decades I had to explain so often that scientists have their own definitions for many common words. Here (and other pages throughout the book) Krauss clearly explains many of those words and their scientific definitions. Wonderful! I will refer to this book regularly for that much alone.<br /><br />His meaningless term \\"intellectually lazy\\" is shamefully unscientific.<br />Example \\"A\\"  1+1 = 2<br />Example \\"B\\"  1,000,000,000 - 999,999,998 = 2<br />In contrast, we could easily label Example \\"A\\" as \\"intellectually lazy\\" so should we therefore disregard it? Is it less true? Should it be voided? To claim something is \\"intellectually lazy\\" still in no way discredits the reality or factuality of anything in the slightest. It says \\"nothing,\\" if I may, especially scientifically....<br /><br />I do enjoy the various chapters explaining how conclusions are drawn in cosmology. (Hopefully they don't equate to Ptolemy's epicycles.) Krauss is clear and properly concise (while Dawkins is on the other end of the scale is too verbose) thus I'm not disappointed in the lesser-paged book. Yet, largely \\"nothing\\" of these chapters has anything to do with a universe from nothing.<br /><br />Krauss does throw in too much of his militant atheism. I don't expect too many \\"believers\\" would get too slighted about it though. Almost none of his religious barbs are things I (and not all others) believe anyway. How many today believe angels hold the planets in orbit, or need to be counted on the head of a pin? Or that created in God's image means we have to look like him. Or that the earth actually stopped spinning on its axis for the sun to appear still. Do miracles really \\"circumvent the laws of nature\\" as Krauss insists, or do they utilize them? Only atheists see God as \\"Saddam Hussein-like\\" not professing Christians, so that barb doesn't apply. Likewise professing Christians can clearly distinguish fairy-tales and the Bible. Strange how some scientists lament of religion's hampering the advancement of science and knowledge yet, there are those that distract themselves with senseless and time consuming, barbs, comments, meetings, debates, atheist conventions and more, rather than devoting that said time for their own scientific advancements. Fortunately, there are scientists that are intellectual enough to overcome (or simply ignore) such \\"religious\\" hurdles without missing a beat, without bogging themselves down with what they may interpret as mere \\"myths\\" and \\"fairy tales.\\" Could it be militant atheists are seeking out excuses for their own lack of pace? Explain exactly how does someone's belief that water can be turned into wine hamper the gargantuan wonders of scientific advancement. Many \\"young earthers\\" (as Krauss calls them) born and raised on such a concept have changed their minds (as I did) decades or even centuries before scientists diverged themselves away from science and to meddle in religion (a field they continuously demonstrate are most inept to understand, explain and teach anyway, especially from some Christians' POV). Ironically, America's most scientific advances were back when it was more religious, the 1950s and `60s (and prior) yet even beating out `those atheistic commies!' Those decades had more people that believed in God, more people that believed the earth is 6000 years old and more scoffers at evolution. Yet during those same times science in America was advancing in leaps and bounds having no equal or rival from then to today, in our alleged \\"less God/more science\\" era. We had Miller/Urey, quite a sundry list of religious scientists (Krauss himself writes of), In only a few years, America, starting from the bottom, put man on the moon. Shouldn't intellectuals be smart enough to grasp this?<br /><br />Anyway, \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" is nothing at all what you get from the title. Though I still learned something from it, it doesn't explain its own title at all. Such a title is almost as apt on a cookbook or a car-repair manual. Even the religious barbs are \\"nothing.\\"<br /><br />\\"gravitational \\"pressure\\" associated with such energy in EMPTY SPACE is actually negative.\\" Can \\"empty space\\" that has such properties still be truly nothing? As long as you allow Krauss' nothing to really mean \\"empty space\\" that isn't really empty or absolutely nothing, the book isn't so misleading. If you want a book that explains a universe from true hard-core nothingness, this isn't the book your'e looking for.<br /><br />We must \\"revise what is sensible to accommodate the universe.\\"  ...  \\"`out of nothing nothing comes' has no foundation in science.\\"  ....  \\"the meaning of these words is not what it once was.\\" ......Lawrence Krauss....Author
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Great album! Love relaxing to the tunes or getting hyped up in the gym! Fun and catchy. Go Bruno go!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I really like these. they fit my ears really well. I can hear what is coming through the headphones and still hear what is going on around me. fidelity is not so much of an issue for me at 62 years old and listening to MP3's, so I have no comment on that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It has been a long time since I absolutely devoured a book. I finished this one in just under 3 days! I literally couldn't put it down. Nick's wife Amy disappears on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary under suspicious circumstances, and he has no plausible alibi for most of the day. But he acts like a forlorn, grieving husband - except when he doesn't; and still we are lead to believe that he didn't kill her. Then we find out that he has been having an affair for over a year, so maybe he did do it after all?<br /><br />The first two thirds of the book proceeds with a chapter of first person reporting by Nick, alternating with a chapter as told through Amy's diary. We don't know who is reading from the diary or where it is. But it certainly implicates Nick heavily. The pace and narration of the novel changes considerably in Part 2, though it is no less engrossing.<br /><br />Without including any spoilers, I can just say that the truths, lies, half-lies, innuendos, assumptions, mysteries and plot twists are woven into an astonishing tale with an equally astonishing conclusion. It is a compelling story of relationships gone awry, and a chilling reminder that we can never thoroughly know another person.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A fun read initially but wears thin by the end.  Not a bad for a diversion on a long flight.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|All-time favorite for my boys.  They want to watch this movie every day.  They love, &#34;Hulk, smash!&#34;  It has all of their favorites except Spiderman!
B00474GUEA|5.0|I love this album. It's got everything you could want from an album; both perfect pop songs and long ambient pieces that sounds awesome. Highly recommended.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|Movie was boring and not scary.  Video quality from Amazon was terrible even though I have a connection speed of 20 Mbps.  Lately, Amazon movies keep freezing or downgrading from HD to almost unwatchable video quality.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig's Bond was perfect. He looks more mature yet very fit in this role. The premise of the film was that time were changing and that it was no longer obvious enemies in the open but shadowy figures which could lurking within the ranks of the secret service or allies. This also alluded to Bond's personal demons. Judy Dench takes a bow. After an opening sequence where Bond is shot by a new operative, MI6 is forced to concede that their top agent has met his demise. M is somewhat disgraced by mounting losses and is forced with the reappearance of Bond to stem the tide of defeat from a worthy foe. The usual staple of all these films: tobacco, alcohol, call girls, and gambling are present here as the trail of deception and cover-blowing are traced back to a previous operative. At the end Bond must resolve his sense of loss of his parents (and kill the bad guys) at his childhood home in Scotland, aptly named Skyfall. I say this is sentimental since new blood is trying to push Bond and M out of the way.
B001LM1456|5.0|My kids love the Hulk, and after seeing The Avengers, they had to have this movie. If you love the Hulk too, this is a must for your collection!
B008JEJVXG|5.0|This album really surprised me. It's probably the best produced album of the year, with it's punchy bass and it's crisp treble. All in all, it's a welcome improvement over \\"Gemini\\". The tunes are mostly all strong, and all of the singles, especially, are amazing. \\"Paradise\\" is certainly one of 2012's best songs. It's a throwback for sure, but it still sounds modern and it's still distinctive, despite being what many consider to be just 'another chill-wave album'. Make no mistake, he great songwriting set this one apart. Highly recommended.

B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Movie was excellent.  The video quality from Amazon was terrible, as it has been lately.  Even though I have a fast internet connection and never have issues with Netflix or Apple TV, I keep getting terrible video quality from Amazon where the video freezes or downgrades from HD to standard definition or worse.  Have started watching movies on other services now because it has happened too many times.

B009CF7GRY|4.0|I enjoyed this remake of the classic movie Footloose.  I would have liked a lot more dancing in the movie, but it kept quite true to the original story, with some modernization where necessary.  The acting seemed a little forced at times, and I can't say I felt as sympathetic for the characters in this version as I did the original, but that might just be because the plot seems less plausible in a more modern era.  I watched it free as part of Amazon Prime - I wouldn't have paid to rent it.  But it was cute.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Though intricate and sometimes a tough read, Martin does not disappoint. With new characters and exotic new places the reader is instantly transported and engrossed from page one. The story continues in its deeply mysterious style with so much still hidden in the shadows,the only disappointment is having to wait for the next portion to arrive!!!!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Truly one of the best writers on the planet and off.  Catches your interest right from the start.  Kinda predictable but you don't mind cause it is so well written to keep you guessing.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I think it would be even better if it had either a zipper or snap to hold it closed. Also would be better if it was a bit thicker and had a inside pocket to keep the charger in.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|I heard a review of this CD on NPR today where they played a few samples. I looked up the CD as soon as I got home and ordered it. The sound is very smooth; not too jazzy, not too commercial. I hope to hear more from these guys
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I pay to go to movies. Recently, it seems movies have taken the roles formerly occupied by priests and psychologists, explaining to the people who watch them correct moral behavior and examples of what is not. This movie seemed to aspire to that level but, the supporting character is an obnoxious teddy bear. How much more graphic in terms of psychological representation can you get? Tried to push the weed jokes, the fart jokes, the beer jokes and mila kunis, made up as a total hottie, putting up with a guy who hangs out mostly with his teddy bear. Yeah., Sure. Right.

It's not bad. Dunno if I'd call it supple, fast moving writing. Of course, for the season opener, I only watched about three minutes after I saw how I as a viewer was going to be treated.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. I've played so many of these games over the years but t his one is by far my favourite. So much to do, not just finding the &#34;hidden objects&#34; but plenty of other puzzles that have you running back and forth from area to area. Didn't feel this one ended too q quickly either like so many other games I've played before and the extra chapter at the end was a brilliant bonus for the cheap price!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show; The Big Bang Theory is such an incredible comedy I cannot wait to have the Sixth Season!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and was really surprised on how well the movie followed the book as usual there were a few things that were different and that was left out but the book was amazing and very touching
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It certainly deserved best picture award. It was so well done you felt like you were there. I really liked it!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Todd M. Thiede hit it out of the park with his first mystery novel. He grabbed me from the first chapter and he never let go. The roller coaster ride this story sent me on had my heart racing and sometimes the hair on my neck standing up. I couldn't put this book down until I was done. I finished the book and although it a great ending I wanted more from Max and Jesse. I hope he finishes the next book quickly.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert is an amazing singer & songwritter, and this latest album has become one of my favorites of all times!
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|I was a little ambivalent on choosing between 4 or 5 stars. I'm a SQL Server DBA and database developer and have found a few things that are easier for me to do in SQL than I find to do them in PowerPivot using DAX as described in this book. Then I realized that that's totally in keeping with the book's audience and purpose.    This is a book that any Excel power user can get into. You'll be well served to talk to your DBA (if you have one of those), but if you're the only data analyst in your organization then go for it. If you've got good SQL chops you may find some of the author's enthusiasm for PowerPIvovt a bit inexplicable, but go along with him, you'll see why.    I'm largely self-taught in PowerPivot and DAX. As with most languages/tools/environments I saw a need, found a tool and started using it. That let me begin to do some interesting stuff with PowerPivot and DAX, but also left large holes in my knowledge and understanding. This book fixed that quite nicely.    So, I recommend this book, and the author's blog ([...]) unreservedly.    I
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|Did not enjoy watching this movie, found it long and dragged out. Not one of Helen Hunts best in my opinion.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It is not much of a challenge but it is a fun simple and quick to play version of chess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love this. Always looking for things to keep them busy and this one does the job. They love this game because it is so similar to temple run and they already beat that game. Great maker of games!
B000OVLINI|4.0|In spite of some strange descriptions and odd alliteration, The Shadow of the Wind stands up to its awards. Much of the oddity could be chalked up to translation but Daniel's story is rich and gripping--a very good, Gothic read.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I loved this app so much! It is so addicting. I played it on my friend's iPhone and fell in  love with it. I had to get it myself so I did. Totally worth the $1.99... you won't regret it! :)
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved the other books and couldn't wait for this one. But it was such a slow start reading. I was a bit bored an  forcing myself to get through the beginning. When it finally got going and exciting.....it was over. It just ended with so much left unanswered. I was so disappointed. Knowing this was a trilogy and this is the last book, I am mad about the unanswered. If you liked the other books I still recommend reading, especially if your like me an  have to finish a series you start.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It was a pretty good horror flick, thought I have to admit the cheese factor is quite prevalent. I think the zombie ghost kids kinda gave it a &#34;six sense&#34; feel. All in all a pretty good modern big budget b-movie!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can't even explain how beautifully worded, honest, and tear jerking this book is. This is honestly, going to be an all time favorite of mine.
0765325950|4.0|A memory of light did not get five stars because to me it was not a five star book. While the book is very solid and a wonderful read it felt out of pace with the rest of the series, and I feel it could have been split again just to make up for the large cast that has come to makeup the point of view story telling.<br /><br />Very solid and fun. If you love wheel of time you are going to get this book anyways!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I used to use Free Cell,,,,,,,,,,,,now I am adicted to Spider!<br />every chance I get I play on my Kindle Fire
1451648537|5.0|Very informative and easy reading. I guess I should have bout it digitally but the hardcover was cheaper... Go figure!!
B0089XH38M|4.0|I don't know if it's really needed or not, but it seems to work. It is really not very intrusive. I guess the best part of a antivirus software is that it can run without bothering me. This program meets that criteria.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Love this mini series.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones play off each others characters so well it is EASY to believe that they were lifelong friends.  Watching this movie was a roller coaster of emotions, happy, sad, terrified, concerned, worried, happy, content.  LOVED IT.  A real classic western.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|i downloaded Facebook full from Amaizon appswhen I was done -finally I was able to go and trlklkkkkkk really .definitely would vdoemloadruns smooth.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We absolutely love this movie. It's the first, and thus far, only movie we've ever bought in digital form because we loved it so much. The character concepts were wonderfully creative! The artists stepped so far out of the box on this one that they can't even find their way back and we're thrilled.<br />Darker imagery in the character of Pitch (the Boogeyman) and his minions may make it a bit scary for little's and the Guardians are not all fluffy sugery; so, if your child is particularly sensitive you may want to review the film first.
0062238868|5.0|This is a very well written book by one of Americas greatest heroes. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see the truth.
B00005V9HH|5.0|5 STARS!!! Every actor played their roles well.  I was on the edge of my seat.  Great movie.  Great for movie date night.  Every timeI watch it, and you will want to rewatch it, I try to pick up on clues here and there and still know that I would not have guessed the climax.  Buy this movie because you will not want to watch it with commericals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is so addicting everyone loves it so will you.It is like temple run but different.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked this game. It has many different puzzles not just picture finds like a lot of other games. Great graphics ! Easy to use and not that difficult to figure out each task. Only complaint is I wish there was more !! I could have played this for many more hours.
1556438850|5.0|İt is very good explained and also for a start it is very good to have ready lessons for the new teachers.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|**This review will contain spoilers for the previous books it in the series**<br /><br />Requiem completed Lena’s character development for me. She grew so much as a person from Delirium to Requiem, it was amazing to watch her transformation in the pages.  She was so strong, so tough but also still had that softness, the kindness that she did in Delirium. I love her character through and through. Alex made me so sad. So freakin sad. He was so rough, and hard and not at all like the Alex I knew from Delirium. Obviously, I expected that because he was in the Crypts but… it was tough to actually see it play out. I still love him all the same though. Raven was solidified as one of my favorite characters in this series. I absolutely loved her. She was so rough and harsh but with this amazing soft interior that you only caught glimpses of. Her and Tack’s relationship was so special, because it was mostly private – just between them. I was also pleasantly surprised that I loved Hana. After I read the novella, Hana, I absolutely despised her so I expected nothing less for Requiem as well. Not so… I really enjoyed seeing her growth and development as a person after she had the cure. Cassie made such a great point after we had finished reading: that Lauren Oliver has this amazing ability of making ALL of her supporting and even just fly by the moment characters so IMPORTANT. You just cannot help to emotionally latch on to them, you ache for them at every moment. Good or bad. Every single character was developed to perfection.<br /><br />I loved the dual point of view between Hana and Lena. I was actually upset when I initially found out it was dual POV, especially with Hana(as I said above) but I was shocked to discover I loved it. It opened up so much of the story line and obviously as it says in the synopsis, their stories converge, so it’s amazing to see that play out from both characters. Hana’s perspective was very interesting because I expected her to be a lot different after the cure. She still has an underlying of the old Hana and that was very refreshing. I also loved seeing the first hand effects of the cure, as opposed to seeing Lena’s perspective of interacting with cured individuals. It made it so real to experience it along with Hana.<br /><br />There was a certain incident that shook me to the core. It absolutely devastated me, and made me feel like my heart was tangled up in my chest about to stop beating. I want this to be completely spoiler free, so I won’t say what it is however it actually made me like Requiem a bit less than I originally would have. The “incident” as we will call it, is done to proper Lauren Oliver form, in the fact that it was flawlessly done however I disagree with it taking place at all. I feel it didn’t add anything to the story, it more so took a piece away from it.<br /><br />The writing was amazing. I almost feel like I don’t even need to comment on that. Lauren Oliver is a beautiful writer, and that hasn’t changed for Requiem. In fact, certain parts of it are so heart wrenching, so poetic that I was practically gasping. I’m not sure what it is with this series but I actually lose my breath at times, the prose is just beautiful. I was shocked, I was fell in love, I cried, I screamed… I ran through every possible emotion.<br /><br />In summary, I loved Requiem. I loved it as a continuation of the series but I didn’t love it entirely as the final book. I wish there was a fourth book. There are things that I would like to know but unfortunately this is the ending. Of my favorite trilogy, of the journey of my favorite characters. It’s over. I expected to be disappointed by Requiem  and thankfully I wasn’t. However… because of some unanswered questions and the above said event, it is my least favorite of the three.lot different after the cure.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|its lots of fun to play can not wait to buy more horses and compete in more games. and buy more stuff .
B00AF6B1MU|5.0|This is def the most awesome live album from the era. The product itself is amazing and should be the #1 want for any Iron Maiden fan... I have the original Vinyl from its original release. Having both is def the best overall scenario as they are very different products. Love it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|You will love this, love this book. If: you like historical fiction, a love story, and a little mystery. It's a love story without too much skin. It's a great mystery without giving it away. It's an excellent historical fiction that does not re-live the atrocities of WWII, but just uses the war as a backdrop for a little added drama. I'd love to see this one made into a movie.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I've been listening to Steven Wilson's work for over a decade now. I've used the words, \\"he'll never be able to top that one\\" countless times. I used it when I originally heard In Absentia and the haunting Fear of a Blank Planet. Now with \\"The Raven that Refused to Sing\\", I can honestly claim that this is his finest work to date. I'm not going to drop you with cliches like \\"album of the year\\" or \\"album of the decade\\". In my honest, humble opinion, the best praise I can give this album is that it is Steven Wilson's finest work in his career.  The variety, the musicianship, the production, and the emotion all create an album that will revered in time by prog fans.  Even if you are unfamiliar with most of Wilson's earlier efforts, I think if you are a fan of 70s prog music, this one should not disappoint.
B003L77GGK|4.0|Not as fantastic as first five seasons but if you've made it this far with the boys, you may as well ride it out.  Music almost none existent compared to previous seasons
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|Irom Maiden inspired so many heavy metal bands in the eighties. From Metallica to Anthrax and beyond. This was the beginning of fast paced metal. This album has no &#34;dead spots&#34; every song is an epic and thunderous adventure.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The good part about this book: You want to know what happens and it's a fast read. It makes you think.<br /><br />The bad parts:<br /><br />It's totally unbelievable. Ok, I know it's fiction, but I think the author could have developed the female character more consistently. She does things that I didn't buy, (Spoiler Alert!) even though she was crazy.<br /><br />Also, the language is horrible. (I'm not a prude, but after so many F's and C's referring to women, it gets old.)<br /><br />The sex scenes are too graphic. Ok, maybe I am a prude. But for me, this story was not about boobs and excretions, so why include all that? It just made it feel cheap. If it's going to be a psychological thriller, make it beautiful, thoughtful. This was just skin for titillation's sake.<br /><br />The end. I didn't like it. This only brought my rating down from a three to a two, because like life, I understand that &#34;you don't always get what you want.&#34; But come on, Flynn! I felt like we deserved a chapter or two to wrap it up after all of that.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|I bought this book on a whim as I wasn't familiar with the story. Belgium is not a country I would have attributed with African oppression and this is shocking. In addition to telling the Belgian-African story, it also illustrates the complexities and ironies of international politics. Certainly parallels today. Although the story was a bit tedious at points, overall it was a worthwhile read and informative.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Start with the first season then work your way thru. to five. Believe me it's well worth it.  If you watch reruns or on Netflix they change the original music.<br /><br />6-8... ehhh, by then you're hooked but the writing is nowhere near the quality of the first 5 seasons.
0756405890|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Haven't read such captivating fantasy in decades!  Loved the characters, loved the writing and found myself fully immersed in the story.  Terrific world building, particularly with the magic.  I found my self cheering and laughing outloud, clapping with joy and hooting with excitement throughout the story.  I loved it!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie was realistic and exciting.  The acting was excellent.  Ben Affleck did a great job, both directing and acting.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I had been on the lookout for an alternative to the usual weather apps. I thought I would give this new one a try. I am so glad I did. It does exactly what I want and does it with beautiful style. I am able to enter multiple locations and with a simple swipe go from a very nice looking page showing the current weather to hourly weather to weekly weather.<br /><br />The ads are not bothersome but I think I will buy this app to remove the ad just because the ui is so good looking and also to support the developer for a job well done.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who appreciates an expert blend of form and function. Thanks to the developer.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Easy to use PDF viewer. I don't need anything else. Quickly identifies all you PDF's  for viewing. Let's me read manuals and other PDF's that I have downloaded from the computer.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel did another great job - his acting was excellent - to the point of making the audience uncomfortable.  The plot presents complicated moral conflicts.  Great movie.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I have not played pinball in forever! The game was free and it takes a minute to figure it out, but it's fun and easy to rack up points.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Have sometimes accidentally purchased two copies of a season's DVD's because I would hate to have to watch on my computer until I get old.  If I could get someone to  set up my Roku, it would save me money--until then I will have all episodes both on digital on demand and DVD's.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Bad acting, bad plot.  The movie focused on showing lots of skin, obscenities, and perversion.  Very disappointed in Matthew McConaughey for agreeing to act in a bad porno film.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like the way this app appears. It's very easy to find what you're looking for. I have not used this app a lot, but like it so far.
1932100385|5.0|Many have tried to sort out the claims and rebuttal, the science and conjecture, seeking a balance about nutritionally based wellbeing and it's a hard slog. Given the important criteria: strong evidence; strong logic, even reflecting the scientific method; and clear lessons with an implicit action plan, the \\"The China Study\\" - it has it all.<br /><br />Taking up Campbell's recommendations will not be easy for everyone. Further reading on specific diet and meal options is necessary. Nevertheless, the fact that his lessons address so many health problems is breathtaking. While most readers will focus on their own health, one can't help extrapolating, as Campbell does, about the broader economic implications of taking up his recommendations. It is important to acknowledge that some of his findings are irrefutable, others need more research and refinement but make more sense than anything else. To be critical because of any need for more work would be ungracious, lifespans are finite and we have to work with what we have.<br /><br />Campbell is a sincere and decent man, and his totally justified criticisms of the medical, industrial and government institutions are constrained yet compelling. They are an essential backdrop to his recommendations. Most references are to US systems but ring true for the way things work in Australia and other countries with similar socio-economic status. Campbell talks about himself and others who have helped him crystallize his views. Omitting some of this may have made the book shorter and more accessible but, in balance, these were essential elements to explain why Campbell's message is so important, albeit out of step with parts of the health establishment. If he is indulgent in places, it probably only strengthens his story. I can sincerely say this book can change lives.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|The thumbnail of the product looks like it has great bells & whistles, but for the everyday Joe it is just ho-hum. Not that exciting. Works alright on the Kindle though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! I use it often and have had no problems with this app. I like being able to highlight and bookmark whatever scriptures I need to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book it's fun but did that have to be the ending I'm reading it on my iPad so I can get the next book right after I read this one but still what if you read them as they were coming out you don't know what will happen for months at a time that's my &#34;only&#34; complaint
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Metal Gear Rising is a huge surprise of vocal tracks that really make me want to play the game over and over again, and listen to the tracks just as much. Stranger I Remain and Rules of Nature are so awesome.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Oh, how I wish I had all day to just dream and gaze through this site. I absolutely love looking at everyone's creativity. I feel totally inspired after being on this site.
111846446X|5.0|The book was actually for my husband, and he is the one who loves it. It has pretty much everything in it that he needed to start using his new raspberry pi toy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie! Fat Amy had me on the floor!<br />I could watch this movie over and over again.<br />Just filling in space so I submit this
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Some people equate Condor products with airsoft and therefore for kids, but I think they're missing the boat. While I might not go to war with this equipment, it is far more rugged than most of us will ever need it to be. This &#34;chest rig&#34; (which is actually more of a &#34;waist rig&#34; due to where it rides) is made of tough material and appears to be well-stitched and well put together. Condor seems to have some really smart designers, because they think of everything - there are pockets in the right places, padding where it needs to be, lots of molle attachment points and many other thoughtful touches. Fit is great, since you can adjust every aspect of it to your own physique.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Well-made, with good strong stitching, heavy-duty Velcro, and heavy nylon material<br />- Well-designed, with lots of mag pockets and attachment points<br />- Good fit, and comfortable to wear<br />- Good flexibility, with removable pistol mag pockets and lots of places to customize your gear carry<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- As delivered, the rig is stiff, but I expect it to loosen up with use<br />- The buckles are plastic and I don't know how well they'll hold up to heavy use<br />- Some won't like the Velcro closures on the mag pockets, since it's noisy to open<br />- A couple of the molle ladder sections are a bit tight, but still usable<br /><br />This rig is an excellent piece in my opinion, and it nicely complements my Condor tactical soft gun cases. And the FDE color match is also spot on for those who care about such things. I've seen reports of Condor gear with bad stitching, but I've never encountered that myself. This one is nicely done. And compared to rigs at three times the cost, this one fits my needs much better. But if you're looking for a true chest rig (with plate pockets, etc.) this one won't do, as it rides down at waist level.<br /><br />All in all, I love this rig and think it is a steal at this price.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The title caught my curiosity.  There were one or tow areas of the book that didn't amuse me but I kept on reading to the end since I really wanted to know how it ended and I was glad. Learning of the orphanages in Ireland was sad news that I never knew of the abuses. I liked the ending, it was worth the read.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|its kind of boring once you get started but in the end it all worth it. ITS NOT THAT BAD OF A BOOK AT ALL.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I thought this was a great story. A story about small town politics, badgering of lives and the need for people to interfere with each other. The way that a whole community was entwined and we got a glimpse of what was going on inside each home made this an interesting read. I had a little trouble in the beginning remembering all the characters but as the story developed it became easier. The ending was a good finish and made me feel that what you think you want in life may not be what you really want if circumstances are different.For me this was an enjoyable reading experience and I was sad to reach the end!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Is there every a &#34;happy&#34; episode in this show?  It would be nice to see at one happy episode on this show, but apparently we will need to wait a little longer.  Still very good, but a bit dark.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|It just gets better and better. Who knew after such a short first series, less than 10 episodes I believe; I could be wrong on that point.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|you can't come away with anything but a good feeling after you read this book.  You look at things differently.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|Read this so long ago I'd almost forgotten it, but it was nice to dip back in to Agatha Christie and this is one of the very best, maybe even the best.  Well structured, good plot, the twist all setting a benchmark for all future crime novels.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|My favorite tv show to date. I like this series better than Bones my close second. I love the characters.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is also one of the saddest books I have ever read. Spoiler alert: A lot of the main characters die living a good life. :)
B005LAIH2W|4.0|wow what can i say, what a good movie!! it had a nice balance of good, evil, plot, humor and moral!!i loved lyn collins acting, she definitely added a bit of spice to an already succulent story line. unable to stay away, i suppose this shall be my turkish delight... LOL
B008IG5BHK|1.0|My daughter loves the movie Pocahontas. However, she wouldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this one. She didn't like it and she thought it was scary.  Definitely should have rented before we bought it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It's just the same as all the rest, it's not the worst but it's not the best. If you liked Alien series this is for you
B00138H876|5.0|One of his best. Not a bad track. Not only interesting lyrics but unforgettable melodies. I keep coming back to this one.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was over before I knew it...the pages just fly with the story of pat and his need of a happy ending. Plan on a long day of reading with this book, it's hard to put down...I recommend this book to anyone with the need of a silver lining...going to watch the movie next
1455523550|5.0|I love reading a book and then seeing the movie, and when I saw Safe Haven being advertised on tv, I couldn't wait to see it and find out if there was a book! I was excited to find out that it was by Nicholas Sparks and knew it would be a great story - and I was right!! This book is amazing. & I hope the movie is just as good! I would definitely recommend this book (I read it in one night!). It arrived on time, without problem and I love the price. I would definitely recommend this title & this seller!
B009FZFONO|4.0|Walking Dead Season 3 continues to be good - plot is more exciting than season 2. No problems with Amazon's steaming player, HD looks great.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I thought the first book in this series was a little slow, but this second one has me hooked!  I love Jack Reacher!
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I have all oft the seasons of Merlin & the fourth season surely did not disappoint me. The action & plots in these shows are really good. Keeps your interest the whole time. I love to watch shows & movies from that period. It takes you to a whole different time period & you can escape the awful things that are happening in this time period. Especially the attack on the middle class people in this time period. I recommend Merlin highly especially if you like magic. You will wish you could perform some of your own in this day & age.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|why is there someone against my runner???  I could have a lot more points,  etc. sure game is fun but... I feel someone is or has hacked my game.Rome subway suffers.kindle fire.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Well done graphics don't make up for extremely short and amazingly repetitive missions.  I enjoyed the Twin Peaks soundtrack for about 3 minutes, but at that point it had looped a half dozen times  and I'd had enough, which is a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this game.
B008DVKTMW|4.0|The  cardboard packaging is so small and tight that I can barely get the cd out of it...<br />That's the only problem with it
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This was one great movies.  I didn't expect it be about an alcoholic. Denzel Washington was great. It shows you have bad such a disease can be. You have to hid rock bottom before ring able to climb back up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, couldn't stop reading!  It was a great end to the first two books. Haven't read anything like this before.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books!!! They are amazing and I hope she writes many more of them! This is a definate must read!

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|For Amazon:  I was not aware that the ATR3350 needed an adapter in order to work with the iPhone.  When I received mine I attempted to use it with no success.  I promptly sent it back, assuming that it was faulty, and asked for a replacement.  I had read that a number of these devices had been found to be faulty by the users.  I have since done some more research on the net and found that they will not function without an adapter, which I have since ordered from another supplier.  Had the Amazon ad indicated that an adapter was necessary I would have bought one along with the ATR3350 AND it would not have been necessary to return the first one I received.  More revenue and less expense for Amazon by presenting an accurate advertisement!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading this book just to see what the fuss was about. Then realized that I could not put it down! The story is amazing and I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|No good guys. Only interests.<br /><br />Lays the foundations for the coming war in season 3.<br /><br />You win or you die.
B009K0P10K|5.0|The is the best show. I love all the characters the story line,everything about it. I highly recommend it. Watch the 1 season too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have not read a book this good in a very long time! The storyline is great and I was unable to put it down!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I have really had a hard time getting interested in this book. I normally can't wait to put Rick's books down. The plot seems disjointed and the character development is lacking. Hope he does better with the latest installment in the Kane Chronicles.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Some of Streisand most beautiful singing!!  So talented!!  What blessing her talent is!!  She's a phenominal singer with such expression!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Thought provoking, a little misleading, could be misleading if you aren't in the right frame of mind. Might make the reader believe she could make an abusive man change.
B00B10GYZ8|5.0|Great to see the inside story<br />Kept my interest the whole movie I would like to see more movies like this
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app and its a lot more challenging than the first. But on my Kindle Fire I kept trying to play it but it wouldn't load.... Soooo I deleted it and now I'm installing it again. Cross my fingers it'll work!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Maggie Smith is awesome as are the other characters and I enjoy the historical information.  Can't wait to watch more.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|We really enjoyed watching the movie, Denzel is always good, even in lousy roles, which he rarely gets.  The movie had spectacular footage of the plane landing, and actually it was worth the money.  For anyone who loves Denzel Man on Fire is a must see.
B00A6C3JN2|4.0|This is a genuine Arduino Due manufactured by Arduino and is made in Italy. The only thing that it lacks is more secure packaging. It came in a normal Arduino box but it had no padding so the box was smashed but the board was fine and is currently working perfectly. I recommend this to anybody looking to buy an Arduino Due.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game has good graphics and a ton f hidden object puzzles.  Even my 4 year old liked helping me complete the puzzles.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|User friendly program with lots of puzzles to choose from.  Lots of options and choices;  easy to challenging puzzles to choose from.
1603427244|5.0|Photographs of each methods make information very clear. Very practical information. I love this book and I will be referring to it often. It's great that it is spiral bond so you don't have to hold it open while you knit. I'm really glad I bought this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very well planned out hidden picture game,  the extra games helped add variety, and the objects were very well hidden.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The only problem I have with temple run 2 is when I have like lets say two-thousand coins it'll jack my coins and take it down to like 500 its stupid.
B00A2GQT5C|5.0|I just love this cd. It takes me back when I frist heard this great women's voice. It is worth listening to it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a s fun as the original. Great game to pick up that doesn't take a lot of time.
B002361MLA|5.0|The author previously gave a weekly series on a previous book on the Oprah Winfrey show.  That was an excellent exercise as is his present book.  Gives a good grasp on living in the present moment and how ego tries to move us away from the grounding of the present moment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the writing and want more Flynn, Excellent pacing and character development but I sort of resented being manipulated into caring so much about such a psychopath.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not much to say here. It's the facebook app for Amazon. It works just as well as other apps on all the other platforms.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Like my daughter said: Still Kidrauhl. This guy is not changing. He is just growing up. Now i see why my daughter loves him.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The acting, plot and directing were terrific!.  You're kept on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.  Hats off to the Canadians.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It made u think about things in a completely. Different way. It was a great book. I recommend it to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|On to next book c a n t wait to see what happens next to katniss and peeta. Does she escapes the wrath of the capitol and is she able to sort out her feelings for peeta and Gale
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are great and it is definitely a cute game. I love all the beautiful backgrounds. And I love all of the horse options.
B000O174CM|5.0|Even though this movie was produced a few years back, there are amazing scenes here that place you where &#34;the Giants&#34; in Soul and Rhythm and Blues music had to walk to &#34;make it&#34; in the music business. My favorite is Eddy Murphy, an actor who never fails to deliver a back-breaking, believable performance. Yes, Jennifer Hudson steals the show with her voice alone, but you can't overlook the shear sexual prowess of Beyonce Knowles as the &#34;chosen one&#34;.<br />This is a movie to be seen, put aside, and brought out again when you want musical excitement.<br />AD
B009J2VQSK|4.0|Although I was disappointed that this disc excluded tunes played in the movie like Led Zep's &#34;What is and What Should Never Be,&#34; White Stripes' &#34;Hello Operator,&#34; and Stevie Wonder's &#34;Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing,&#34; the disc is very enjoyable.  (At least I already own the original discs on which those songs appear.)  I was particularly pleased that the two Dave Brubek tunes have been included.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a really awesome game.I really enjoyed the game play.I just wish it had more levels.I hope you make a sequel.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I bought this for my nieces and nephews as a gift for Christmas. It is one of their favorites and they had worn out the VHS and the DVD gets plenty of use as well. Now they can enjoy their favorite story it in all of its glory.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|It was a gritty story with some endings that were happy but most realistic.  There were several plots at the same time and they all melded together.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I had much higher expectations from walberg and macfarlane but this did not do it for me.  Some childish movies are good; this one is not.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book discusses something that I hadn't noticed before and had taken for granted called &#34;habit&#34; and explains it in a clear way for any kind of reader.<br /><br />It also offers several ways to improve our life by modifying our habits in any aspect of our life, be that in a company, inside a family, or anything else. In fact, I would argue now that understanding about these &#34;habits&#34; itself would bring a change to ourselves.<br /><br />I think the way I'm looking at the world around me has changed since I started reading this insightful book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|fantastic - looking forward to Season 4 (and many more thereafter). superb cast of characters, mezmorizing costumes, safe for the whole family, well portrayed historical fiction.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|The levels progress and a good rate.  It was just easy enough and just challenging enough to keep us going.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great movie love Denzel~ nice twist!<br />Nice ass too, just think if all the airlines are like this?  Oh they are!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|We now own all the Dr. Panda games and look forward to more. These are the go to games for my kids.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Johnny Depp was amazing as always. The story was very good. We would watch it again and again. Worth it.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|The game is the same thing over and over but I gave it 5 stars because of my kids. Any game that they play over and over and never need my help is worthy of five stars. We only have one tablet and this game allows for easy sharing. Each kid makes on pictures then passes it.
B00993I6D2|5.0|It is a portrait of the future, even if the time line is off. You can see our slide toward this direction. It is a blueprint for what is to come. Everyone can relate to the characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book keeps your attention from page one. It touches your heart and, yet, has a suspenseful side as well.
B0094K1YHK|4.0|We enjoyed it. It was better than we had expected. We would watch it again some day. Worth seeing for anyone.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This game is awesome and is a perfect add on to minecraft sorry for the people it didn't work for BUT this is epic!!!!
B00993G41S|5.0|Very funny, even my very old parents liked it. The characters were appealing and the ending was a plesant surprise.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is AWESOME there are no glitches. Plus, it doesn't require Wi-Fi. I would recommend this to creative people. It is the best app the people who created this app and the other &quot;craft games have come up with.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|Sinister was not that great of a movie. They could have made it so much better if they really wanted to.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game. It has awesome graphics as well. I just wish gems were easier to get! Over all it is an awesome game for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and has enough detail to keep me interested.  There is some lag every once in a while but not enough to annoy me.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY THE BEATLES VERY FIRST ALBUM/FIRST RECORDINGS BY THE BEATLES WITH TONY SHERIDAN/it has the only gospel song the beatles ever recorded/WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN/it would have been nice to see their first album included in this box set. YOU HAVE TO BUY/FIRST RECORDINGS/separate on CD OFF OF AMAZON/its worth the buy! JESUS LOVES YOU!
B004289ZW0|3.0|the GPS unit is good, and works well. But I really do not understand why they needed to implement the power on/off with this awkward and not very reliably working touch screen like sensor. Doesn't always power on/off when you want.<br />Why did they not use a simple power switch??  Even a power-button to press would have been a stellar improvement.<br /><br />Well, but that's my only gripe with the unit. I hope version 2 gets rid of that touch-sensor.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book. I would recommend it to everyone. The idea of what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas but ends up a once in a lifetime, almost lost love is awesome.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the series for a long time and when I heard about the these releases I was trying to get it on Blu-Ray and I couldn't find them anywhere (thanks amazon). I do have two warning to those who are buying this release: First, the box art says that there is a 20 page guidebook that comes with the movie. M first copy did not have it and when amazon gave me an exchange, it didn't have it in that one either. It's not too big of a deal for me, I just have a &#34;thing&#34; for having a complete package. Second, *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* If you've seen the original series, then this movie isn't going to show you anything you haven't seen before (for the most part). Though with that said, I highly recommend it anyway.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love all three seasons of this show. This show has a little of everything from terror,drama,romance, and anarchy. It has government issues and shows how people can be easily deceived by government. It shows how people even in the end can still not value human life, as they continue to kill each other for things that we take for granted everyday. I highly recommend this series.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Where the first movie was all about recapping the first quarter of the original series, they went nuts with this one. It's a huge improvement from the 1st one (not to say the first one was bad at all) and the action is revved up in this one. I can't wait for the 3rd and final movies!  :D
0061950726|5.0|If you were leaving your home forever, what would you take with you?  Seventeen year old Molly Ayer is challenged by her High School English teacher to interview someone and charge them with this question.  The idea is that certain things - either good or bad - stick in your memory forever.  What things do you recall form your life history? What experiences are most meaningful to you?<br />Meanwhile, Molly has been convicted of stealing a library book; she has been sentenced to 50 hours of community service of her choice.  Eighty one year old Vivian Daly agrees to have Molly help her \\"clean out\\" her attic, filled with memories, and Molly takes this on as her community activity.<br />The title Orphan Train refers to the people and practice of taking orphaned or unwanted children from New York to the American Midwest, where they will be put with families who are expected to raise them as their own.  Not surprisingly, many such families are looking unpaid household or farm help rather than children to raise as part of their family.  The book Orphan Train follows Vivian Daly's stories of her transport to Minnesota and her subsequent struggles away from her initial new \\"family\\" toward her sew and productive adult life.  The time span begins in the mid 1920s, so Vivian's stories include the effects of the Great Depression, Hitler's invasion of the rest of Europe, and the American involvement in WW II.<br />This novel feeds my love of stories about ordinary people overcoming life's challenges, especially when such stories contribute to me awareness of our country's history.  It talked to me and drew out my empathy for the young orphan characters in the book - and all those whose lives sent them away from the only families they knew to start over in an unknown land.
B00821OX98|4.0|I watch this on my lunch breaks. It is a red dawn type struggle vs aliens. Lots of unknowns and the group learns something new every episode which makes the show very addictive.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Already hooked on the series, it was great to see the addition of the few minutes cut from our American Version!<br /><br />Supurb! Thanks again!
B000FC12SM|5.0|I gives very.respectful examples actions on how to improve. I totally recommend it and it is better to read it with your.couple
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Interesting for its historical treatment of this difficult time in England.  Superbly acted.  Uplifting, triumphant finale! I thoroughly enjoyed this season.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Didn't finish -- quit reading during the third book -- I was bored and disgusted with all the killings and didn't like the concept of the story.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Who hasn't seen the movie? well the book is 100 times better Stoker was a legend, this book is awesome
B000FC146C|5.0|Loved the book and the movie.  One of my all-time favorites!  Will probably read it many more times.  I would give it more stars if possible.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|The movie it self was just amazing.. but as for the shipment here it took a lot longer then expected.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thinks its a good game but the price for the other horses cost to much moeny, beside that it is a good game
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this down. And cannot wait to start the last book! SO GOOD!!! I want to squeal!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Grafics are great love the little mini games, downfall is I don't like the adds that pop ups and it stops working when the adds come up this is the only flaw that I have found in the game otherwise it is an excelent game for horse lovers!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun and so fast that the more more you get in to it you want to keep playing. And that's really good because that way you are occupied and not board.I love this game download it you will love it garented!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This one is a GREAT kid friendly game!!!  We are horse lover's so this one fit us best and the picture quality is better than what I had expected.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy in hardback form so well that I was hesitant to even consider the movie.  We all know what happens so often when really good books are made into medeocre movies.  But let me be quick to say that is NOT the case with this brilliant interpretation of Suzanne Collins' best seller.  The casting could not be better and even knowing the story right through to the outcome, I was still surprised and in suspense the entire running time.  This is a truly remarkable film which exhibits extreme talent from the very beginning to the final edit.  Can't wait for the next episode of this great and frightening tale to be on the screen.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love how it is a continuation of Percy Jackson & the Olympians. This book is meant for a crowd of people who enjoy one epic fantasy novel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it for home work all the time its so helpful<br /> it works great and its free! I love free apps
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!!! This is one of the best games ever. You can make so many great hairstyles. I just absolutely LOVE it!!!!
1451695195|3.0|Enjoyed his description of his heaven experience; but believe the general public would find this book hard to follow and would lose interest.
B005B19UPE|5.0|This is a truly amazing book telling about the holocaust. It is so hard to imagine anyone going through something this horrific and surviving, yet many did just that. Americans need to remember that something similar happened to Jews right here in America.<br /><br />This book is one that every person needs to read and remember. You feel like you are right there with Julia on her journey.<br /><br />Thank you Tatiana.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|The movie Silent Hill: Revelation and the videogame Silent Hill 3 share some very interesting similiarities. I enjoyed this movie, but gave it 3 stars due to some changed scenes that I would've enjoyed seeing in the movie (Claudia eating the God would've been amazing to see, just saying.) Pyramid head felt a little tacked on, but besides that, this movie is a great rent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best free app in my opinion. the graphics are amazing. i would recommend this to anyone any age. thanks for making this game.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I just want to say that the digital av adapter is exactly what I needed and the price you just can't beat. Thanks a bunch.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. I could sit and play for hours. it really makes you think and use your brain.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I love the story line and I absolutely love playing the find it games. my kids love helping too.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|wanted it for my kindle ,<br /><br />loved the book , liked the movie<br /><br />well worth keeping this in  a permanent library collection
0765325950|5.0|Great way to end the series. I wish there were more to read. I do hope that Sandersson and the Jordan estate consider getting back together to write the prequels that Robert Jordan wanted to write
B007WQYH4K|5.0|One of my favorite movies and scores.  This import version of Once Upon a Time in the West is a more complete than the English titled version currently offered. Skip the other version and pick this one up.  Then sit back and enjoy that haunting harmonica.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was great.  I really enjoyed it, and can't wait for season 3 becomes available!  when will it be out?
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's good but I just don't really like it that much<br />I mean it is ok but it isn't the bomb or anything can I finish my comment now
B005LAIHYU|5.0|very nice movie I  like it a lot to where I was watching it over and orver again it is intersting
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|I'm a huge fan and love the new album. I'm glad they returned to form. The art work is sweet also.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is great, but let's just stick with the stuff included, because I'm sure most of the other users reviewed the movie's content. This includes a DVD, a Blu-Ray, a 3D Blu-Ray, and a &#34;Digital copy&#34; which is a disc which allows you to transfer a Standard Definition version of the movie to an iPod or other portable device. It includes DRM, though, so.....<br /><br />Anyways, this also comes with a halographic cover, but annoyingly, it only is on the package sleeve, not the case itself.<br /><br />But yeah. This is a great value. For an extra $10, you get three extra copies.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This was one of my favorite games on Dreamcast. It's a perfect port. Not as much fun as I remember it, but so glad to be able to relive my memories! I hope more Sega games get ported to newer systems.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander is one more intelligent and eloquent voice bridging the scientific and spiritual worlds with his extraordinary book Proof of Heaven. The fact that a neurosurgeon, of finely tuned and solid scientific bent, was the individual who found himself having a NDE (near-death experience) is beyond coincidence. Heaven chose the perfect spokesperson! Dr. Alexander writes from the heart, which makes his book so readable, but he also includes some of his own scientific observations, which may be helpful to those with a more skeptical mindset. I loved reading all of it, and I especially appreciated the way the book was organized, with chapters describing his own other-worldly experience alternating with chapters describing the experiences of his family members who sat by his side while he was in a coma. This is NOT a dry factual narrative--the beauty of his thoughts, feelings, and perceptions brought me to tears at times. A beautiful uplifting book!<br />--Peggy Kornegger<br />author of Living with Spirit
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I found The Master to be a hypnotic and riveting psychological exploration of a cult movement and how the leader of as cult interacts with his followers and disbelievers. I really enjoyed the \\"processing\\" scenes and \\"applications.\\" I found the lost,angry and alcoholic womanizer Quell portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix to be very real. He reminded me of my father and other disturbed people. Seymour Hoffman was spell binding as the Master and, the movie had an excellent supporting cast. I see the connection to L.R. Hubbard and Scientology. The movie actually exceeded my expectations. There have been a lot of negative reviews of this movie. I guess my taste in movies runs against the grain. Many people think they are a Master in their own mind, but few have the genius and charisma to pull it off, no matter how ridiculus, for any period of time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love to play this game.  It relaxes me.  I can spend hours playing it while I watch TV at night
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game.  The ads are a little annoying but, for a free game I guess it is worth it.
B005O64VH8|5.0|This the music that I listen to!  I love easy listening non-vocal music. This album is another one for my collection, and be listened to many, many times.  Thanks SG, you did it again.
0525952926|5.0|You must read &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; first.  Looking forward to book 3.  Not as good as his middle age epics but I loved it all the same.
0786939532|3.0|I read Dragonlance and Ravenloft as a kid, and enjoyed them a great deal. Never really got into Forgotten Realms as I was always overwhelmed by the sheer amount of novels, and didn't really know where to start. The Ravenloft books were pretty much stand-alone stories, and the Dragaonlance books started with the Chronicles Trilogy and built from there. FR was not that easy until a friend of mine told me to start with R.A. Salvatore's books, namely the Icewind Dale Trilogy. I then discovered that there was a prequel to the Icewind Dale trilogy, so I decided to start there.<br /><br />This book was everything that I expected it to be, and it took me back to the carefree days of childhood, when I would stay up late reading about elves and dragons until the wee hours of the morning, leaving me in a groggy state before class. It introduces, what I'm told, the most admired character in the entire D&D lines of books: Drizzt Do'Urden.<br /><br />Now again, I have not read any other books in this series, so I don't know much about him, but I liked the premise of the story and its inherent conflict - a fish out of water, so to speak.<br /><br />The story begins in Menzobarranzan, home to the drow, a race of dark-skinned elves that are cousins to the surface elves, but were driven underground. In this society, females are superior to males, with each house having a head female (called \\"Matron\\") and a stable of male concubines for her pleasure. The concubines father children, and females are regarded as a prize while men are merely tools for a female's sexual pleasure or as warriors/wizards in the house armies. The setting and the culture itself is portrayed very well, with graphic examples of how male drow are inferior to women. In addition, backstabbing and guile are the norm, with no real sentiment as the matron deity of the drow, Lolth encourages such behavior. For example, in the first pages, one of Drizzt's brothers kills the other brother in cold blood just to elevate hisstatus in the house. The family couldn't care less that one child murdered another.<br /><br />The plot involves House Do'Urden staging a massacre of a rival house to elevate their status. As mentioned, this is fairly common, but with one caveat - the massacre must be complete and no nobles of the house are to be left alive. Not women. Not children. House Do'Urden, led by the megalomaniacal Matron Malice, executes the attack perfectly, but unbeknownst to Malice, there is a survivor that would prove troublesome later on. On the same night, Drizzt is born and is about to be sacrificed as the youngest child in the family (apparently, drow households don't tolerate more than 2 male children), but his brother kills the other brother, thus sparing Drizzt by default.<br /><br />The story continues with a series of events that show the dark elves and their culture, as well as Drizzt and how be became the kick-ass hero that everyone has come to know and love. I found myself engrossed in these various parts, and for that, the book automatically gets three stars. If you think about how little actually happens in the book, yet you still enjoy it, the author did a good job.<br /><br />I took off two stars because there were two flaws that I personally don't like.<br /><br />The author switches point-of-view from character to character in the same scene without using a breaker. I suppose this was common in the late 80s/early 90s, and Salvatore did get the book published. In addition, the characters were fairly cookie-cutter, and other than Briza, Drizzt's oldest sister, who was a sadistic psychopath, the other sisters were unremarkable and underdeveloped. I think Salvatore wasted an opportunity with the character of Vierna. These were all minor points.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD<br /><br />The thing that really disappointed me was captured in the other \\"helpful review\\" beautifully. Drizzt and his father, Zak, were automatically good and despised their heritage and people. No reason was given for this why Zak was so good other than a soliloquoy of sorts at the beginning. I was expecting a better written character arc with Drizzt actually being a model drow - manipulative, deceitful, sadistic - and then slowly changing over the course of the book. By having him as a good guy right from the start seemed like a waste to me.<br /><br />As the other reviewer said, Drizzt spent so much time among cruel drow, then spent time training and being indoctrinated into drow dogma during his formative years, and he still remained good through all of this, completely unfazed.<br /><br />Maybe this will be explained in a future book, but the lack of a stronger character arc for Drizzt was this book greatest flaw.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My kids and I love this movie! Its sure to be a classic. I really appreciate the fact that there's no killing and foul language like some other &#34;cartoons&#34; out there. I feel good knowing that my kids wont pick up any bad habits or bad language from this movie and they love to watch it! Great movie!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This man was amazing. If this book doesn't make you want to be a better person and work harder in every aspect of your life, then something is wrong!  God bless these men and their families.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My kids absolutely love this movie and can watch it all day long! I love the exposure to all different kinds of animals and the idea of team work that it portrays. All in all, I think it's a really cute movie!!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Its pretty fun its like sim city only with dinosaurs woo hoo haha wish u could make money faster though....
B005XBKXV2|4.0|I personally LOVE the Lion King, but when I started watching it with my 1 & 2 yrs olds I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of it. I don't like my kids seeing death and hearing the hyinas saying that if Simba came back they'd kill him. I still love the movie for older kids who understand fact from fiction, I just wish it were more appropriate for younger ages.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|i found a calculator; i wanted for long time. awesome.<br />you can see different type of calculator just by swapping pages.
B00633W614|4.0|It was part of a trilogy that made you want to continue the story. I'm looking foword to the third and last book.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was an interesting story with very well developed characters.  I also felt that I could somewhat understand the life and culture that existed in small Irish villages at that period of time.  Very diffirent from my life experiences.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|My current record time is 2 minutes - trying to improve on that.  This is great fun and challenging.  A good stress buster!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Excellent I recommend it
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Really liked this book. Enjoyed the way it was narrated by two different people. If you liked &#34;The Help&#34;,  you will like this.
B007V65R54|5.0|I thought the book gave many good examples of the famous statement that correlation does not equal causation.  I especially liked the chapter on weather forecasting which explained why TV forecasters skew towards bad weather versus the National Weather Service.
0060987464|5.0|I had bought this book years ago, read it, and loved it.  When I loaned it to a friend and she lost it I had to have another copy.  It's that good.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|I can't recall ever watching a movie so sick & twisted yet kept me watching the entire time. I will admit having to cover my eyes because some of the scenes are just so brutal to watch. The suffering was so intense. Watch at your own risk....
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|We watched this movie with all the lights off and I was creeped out.  It's gruesome and I was tense the entire time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very good. Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to my friends.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We rented this movie off my mom's recommendation and we loved it.  Totally cute and a great family movie.  My son was asking to watch it again for days.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It wasn't as great as people said it was. Never thought I'd say this, but too much sex! It bored me! Not going to buy the other two.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|I've been a Quentin fan for years.  This movie was great.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  Great homage to old school kung fu moives, and a Quentin twist.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The continuing saga did not disappoint. It was a little sad to see the simpler life be a part of the past but, as life is in reality,so is drama that imitates life. The ending was sweet, but,I'm afraid, temporary.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great way to spend some down time, share with friends and kids. plus i love horses so i find this game very entertaining!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Had this playing on the surround sound while opening gifts, this will be our new tridition, there have been several CD's over the years I have bought and listened to once, not this one!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag works well with my Rdbel T3i and holds extra lens. It is about the size of a small Back pack and has plenty of room for more stuff.
B0080M3OGW|4.0|Very hard to go wrong with a movie with De Niro and Streep being some of the best actors in the business.<br /><br />This film is funny, entertaining and brings out the reality of love outside the marriage that finally makes a couple very happy.  I would certainly recommend the movie to my friends.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Dishonest at best, blatant lies at its worst. The filmmaker plays the viewer for a complete idiot with staged events and untrue &#34;facts&#34;. Don't waste your time.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Wanted to really give this film a 2 1/2 star rating.  I was totally disappointed after having watch the other films with the same name.<br /><br />Will admit that the costumes are extraordinary.
B009186JYI|5.0|I have'nt watched the DVD yet so all I can say is that it arrived within the specified window.  I was surprised to see that it was shipped from Argentina, so I hope it's not in French.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|If you like the serie, then yo must read the book.<br />Fantasy, swords, sex, zombies, dragons ... everything you need in one place.
B0012QVJXS|1.0|I can't download the movie, can't watch on the Unbox player because the folder is now locked since updating, and i can't watch on the amazon site because it says my flash needs updating (which i have done twice). I never had this trouble with amazon before. Ah well, it's a lot easier just to find a pirated copy. Bye amazon.
0525478817|1.0|My book club loved this book.  I forced myself to get through forty or so pages before quitting.  I couldn't stand the smart ass voice of the teen, cancer or no.  I think it's a swell book for young adults.  Not a middle aged woman like me.  I like to read more mature takes on things.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Best I've seen.  VERY configurable.  Can mimic just about any calculator I have ever used.  A bit expensive however,  word
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Rock of Ages, not at all what I expected, but I do like Tom so I rented this movie, unfortunately I could not finish the movie.  I heard great things about this one, but it wasn't for me or the timing wasn't right to see this movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|There are no issues with the app. It never freezes or has any glitches. There are a ton of advertisements though.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 started out good but slowed down a bit.  Still a good show, but Season 1 & 2 are much better.  I'm not giving up yet, because I know it can only get better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is perfect for my kindle.  It has no issues and never freezes which some apps do.  It is easy to access and lets you fill hours of your time.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I wasn't for sure what to expect with the Movie, but I really enjoyed it.  It's history that every one should know about.  A must see movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a very great show with an amazing cast and plot twists up the yin yang.<br /><br />Claire Danes does a great job as Carrie Mathison, a very brilliant CIA agent who happens to be bipolar a secret she keeps from her superiors as she tries to convince them that a rescued POW was turned by Al Qaeda, planning a terrorist attack on US.<br /><br />Damian Lewis stars as Sgt. Nicholas Brody, the rescued POW, whom everyone has turned to a poster boy for their political aspirations not knowing about his conditioning by Al Qaeda during captivity.<br /><br />Morena Baccarin stars as Sgt. Brody's wife, who during his years of captivity, wrote him off as dead until she receives a phone call learning that he was indeed alive, started an affair with a close friend and must now come to terms with the fact that her husband is alive.<br /><br />Mandy Patinkin stars as Saul, a fellow agent who is determined to help Carrie piece everything together as he sees she is breaking down.<br /><br />This show is better than 24 (maybe because it's a cable show), but it is filled with surprising plot twists and hidden clues that will have you begging for more.<br /><br />Soon as Season Two is released, I will be there
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Not at all what I expected.  I had to see this one because one of my favorite actors (Matthew Mc) was starring in this one.  Yes he has a nice body, and it has a story line, but not what I expected from Matthew.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|[[ASIN:B003UD7JEE Nikita: The Complete First Season]] introduced us to Nikita (Maggie Q.),an operative for a shadowy government arm called Division, who escapes their grasp and places her own operative, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) within Division's ranks to destroy them from within.<br /><br />This Season it's Nikita vs. Alex. Her protegee may well to prove to be her most lethal enemy. Although still on the outside, Nikita, in possesion of Division's former leader Percy's ( Xander Berkeley)  Black Boxes that could not only bring Division down but certain agencies within the government itself if revealed. Alex remains on the inside of Division, which she now defends in exchange for help in killing her family's killers and she is always slightly ahead of Nikita's every move and secret. Alex also finds out the death of her family is not as true as she was told.<br /><br />Another defected Division agent, Michael (Shane West), has now left Division to aid Nikita in her quest to get the other boxes from their \\"Guardians\\". He also finds out he is a father after an earlier mission.<br /><br />Amanda (Melinda Clarke) now heads Division as Percy has been relieved of command and is now isolated in a glass prison located somewhere in Division headquarters by \\"Oversight\\", who feel threatened by the revelation that Nikita has a Black Box.<br /><br />Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford) escaped from Division also and provides technical help to Michael and Nikita as well as shelter and board. It seems that he is more interested in being known as the greatest hacker in the world than anything else until he is captured and tortured by Amanda.<br /><br />This show has really kicked everything up a notch and I love the storyas well as the characters and will tune in to every season it's on.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Although it was a little sluggish and confusing in the beginning, the book did pick up speed and became more intense to keep me awake and reading until I finished the book. Stephen King enthusiasts will love this book because it is a unique spin on his genre.
B000001EUR|5.0|As a kid I misplaced this cd which was one of my father's favorites. Now im 22, and have been searching everywhere from Beaumont to Houston, to no avail. I decided to check Amazon.com and lo and behold it was in stock at an unbeatable price. It's the real deal. I also ordered this album on Vinyl and am awaiting its arrival and will place it with my father's record collection. Thank you Amazon.com for all that yall do.
1400049628|5.0|Sound and practicle advice for surviving the Zombie Apolcolpyse. I keep a copy in my car at all times just in case I am caught out of my home when the zombies strike. ;) Easy to understand and organized well.
B004YESKU0|5.0|I have been surviving off youtube videos, until now. This gives you every album at once. As soon as it arrived, opened it up and inserted the first cd i grabbed in the radio. No complaints, just praise. If you love SOAD then acquire this, and save the box as a collectible, or recycle it as a holder for pens, etc.<br /><br />I was worried because I had read about imports, but believe me there is nothing to worry about this product. They are the real cds, not bootlegs. I guarantee you will love this product.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|So far, I absolutely LOVE this series! Well worth the read, and if you're watching the TV series as well, it doesn't stray far from the script. The characters are complex yet relatable, and there's just enough magic to keep it fresh.

B00AG6Z92C|1.0|I love Andrea and have listened to him for years. The more I see David Foster's influence the less I hear Andrea himself. I think this album was just another manufactured product &#34;Brought to you by David Foster&#34; - (his favorite line)!!!  I don't dislike D. Foster I dislike the final results with artists  he produces for too long.<br /><br />Andrea had a spirit that resounded through his music and I don't hear this anymore...only mundane covers...he is an original not a cover guy as is  Celine Dion and many others...Too much D. Foster is too much!!! Best thing Andrea could do is find a producer that will embrace his voice and how he makes music jump off the sheet music...<br /><br />Andrea, there are many talented music producers who will not hold you back ...change is a beautiful thing... hope you are listening out there so that you can once again  make &#34;Beautiful Music to everyone's ears!!!&#34;

B001NEK2GE|2.0|World of Warcraft from Blizzard Entertainment has been around over 5 years now and I've played all of them. I have always used a regular keyboard until a year ago. I had a Merc Stealth with the gamepad on the left but the software was out of date and had errors. So I tried this LOGITECH G13 programmable gameboard w/LCD display and I didn't like it. Since it's free standing, it's really a remote keyboard. I found it difficult to get used to the layout even after a couple of weeks. When the dungeon fights got really intense, I found the keyboard was no harder and jumped to it to survive.<br />I use a LOGITECH Illuminated keyboard 820-001268 that is very flat and short-throw keys that push with a precise light touch. It works great for WoW.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|What else is there to say? It's an awesome app that brings the Amazon Market onto my tablet! Now I don't have to go into a web browser just to get on Amazon anymore. You don't have to pinch to zoom or scrool left, right, up or down because the app fully fits onto the screen and the words are large enough to read without straining your eyes. Plus, the interface is smooth and crisp without any hiccups. I love that!
B001993Y2C|3.0|Nothing much to say after C.Mayo's review.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIDK7A9MXV68/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001993Y2C&nodeID=2625373011&store=movies-tv<br /><br />Except that I must make one correction:<br /><br />C. Mayo says:<br />&#34;-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. Recommended. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.&#34;<br /><br />Not true. The SAME issues of the DVD packaging are still present. I just bought this collection because I imagined it was solved, based on the revieW, BUT NO.<br /><br />There is no episode guide or list. Also THE PLAN is not included on this collection. These are the two downsides I see in this collection. Instead, I'd buy the gray box and a collectible Cylon apart.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful to all of you, after all, the show is one of the best science fiction character guided series ever.<br /><br />So say we all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter absolutely loves horses, therefor its a given she loves this game since she can't have a real one.<br /><br />My only complaints are the nagging ads, sometime two at the same time, and the micro transaction model i hate with a passion.  Let me pay 10 bucks and do what i want and i'd probably pay it.  As it is, i refuse to be nickled and dimed to death.
B008M4MB8K|3.0|There is NOTHING new in this collection that wasn't in the Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]  http://www.amazon.com/Runner-Five-Disc-Complete-Collectors-Blu-ray/dp/B000UBMWG4/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1362665739&sr=1-1&keywords=blade+runner+five-disc+ultimate+collector%27s+edition    The only thing better is the packaging, so if you don't have any Blade Runner, your choice should be between the pack you prefer.    Nonetheless, It's one true masterpiece and the Final Cut it's simple superb in High Def.    It's too bad it doesn't have any new extras. But then again, wich does?

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had these earphones for years now - forgot to rate the product when I first received it.<br /><br />I have had no issues whatsoever with this product and would highly recommend anyone looking for a great pair of surround sound headsets for their gaming needs.
B007BGU4S4|4.0|Loved this movie the soundtrack was spot on. It really made the music of Earth, Wind & Fire come alive.  Donny Hathaway's \\"The Ghetto\\" was fitting as was Nina Simone. Well worth the buy
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typically Nicholas  Sparks and typically wonderful reading. Excellent book and would definitely recommend.  Now I will take in the movie.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This DVD arrived ahead of schedule. I had seen it before, but enjoyed watching again. No problems or skips on this DVD.

B001CD3PNI|5.0|Great condition I watched it 12 times I never get tired of this movie. Love the main actor he is hot
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|Just finished watching this movie and WOW! How did I NOT know about this film any sooner??? This is a murder masterpiece. Mr. Ripley is a chilling character because EVERYONE knows someone in their life like Mr. Ripley at one point or another but this movie shows the audience how easy life can slip through one's fingers. I didn't want this movie to end! It had me turning and tumbling at the scenes in which Mr. Ripley loses all sense of boundaries and the reality of his actions. The plot keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what will become of Mr.Ripley and all his other persona's he \\"hi-jacks\\".<br /><br />I am absolutely astounded if anyone rates this lower than 4 stars as it means they either didn't understand the gravity of the story, or their brains just didn't have the capacity to comprehend the social dynamic dance that was appearing in almost every scene.<br /><br />Thank you!!
B001E45XT4|4.0|These are great for its price... Of course I bought it when it was on sale for about 31 dollars.<br /><br />Still, it is a great product and my ears only hurt after 11+ hours.
0920668364|5.0|My mother bought this book for me when I was a little girl and I grew up loving it.  Now that I am expecting, I bought it to read to my son.  It is incredibly touching and a wonderful story to share with your child.  The chorus \\"I love you forever, I like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\" has become a family saying.  I would recommend this book to any mother especially if you have a son.  A must buy!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually don't read books. I read this one after seeing the movie. I like it much better than the movie. It explains things not explained in the movie.
0307887898|5.0|As a veteran of a successful start-up with a successful exit, I wish I had this book when we were building the company. Ries' lessons are ones that we learned the hard way. Had we implemented his ideas and methodology, we would have reached those critical points much sooner--and would have been in a much better financial and bargaining position at our exit (we sold our company).<br /><br />I had been reading this book as I was helping to build a second early-stage start-up. I wish the CEO of the company had actually read the book and taken the lessons to heart. It is enormously hard and painful to create a business from an idea, and the more we can quickly and intelligently evaluate the progress of our work and actions, the more 'agile' we will be in taking a concept and building a sucessful business from that concept.<br /><br />This book took me a long time to read. Every time I'd read a chapter, it would make me think so much about how these steps and actions would impact my company. And surprisingly, after really evaluating Ries' methods and strategies, I came to the conclusion that the leadership of my company had NO methodology; that it was a desperate shot at finding a market for a product, a solution in search of a problem. This realization made me walk away. It also made me think about how I will shape my next company, the next idea.<br /><br />Don't miss this book. If  you're an entrepreneur--either starting up a company or being a innovator within an existing organization--this book will help you shape and tune your PROCESS so you can find the fastest path to success.
B008VVT51U|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has a great cast, great location, unique story.  What's not to like?!!  I loved this movie!
B004SEUIW4|2.0|There are a few laughs in this movie, but not many. (What are Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig even doing in this movie?) This is not a comedy in the laugh out loud sense. Instead, it's a bittersweet tale of a young man coming to grips with a less-than-advertised future and his rather dysfunctional relationship with a young woman he's fallen in love with. In the background are dead parents, cruel step-parents, recently downsized/demoted or completely unemployed parents, a character who cheats on his wife with absolutely no moral qualms, drinking in almost every scene (what is everyone running away from?) and pot smoking in most of the others, some really bad decision making,\\"friends\\" who would sell you out for a quarter, etc. Does all this strike you as funny?<br /><br />Adventureland might be worth watching once. But I can't imagine re-watching it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to play which makes it a great game for children. Keeps me occupied during my breaks while at work.

B008WM4U7W|5.0|Great movie...I loved the Bruce Lee reference at the very end.  Quite often sequels aren't as good as the original, but that's not the case with this one.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I like the premise of the both stories (Book 2 included).  I am however distracted (quite often) by misspelled words and some grammatical concerns.  In one portion, I had to stop and work back to the beginning as Megan's husband who was initially spelled Derek became a Derrick.  Words like bare instead of bear, apologies instead of apologize.  It has a potential for a great read, but seriously, please proof-read this some more.
0307950654|3.0|The excellent P.D. James' Death Comes to Pemberley is now a best-selling paperback, but, as with the hardcover, the source of Pemberley's mystery is overlooked.<br />P.D. James is, after all, both eminent and grise an quite above dispute.<br /><br />There are two elements to her book.<br />ONE: the characters--They are \\"universally acknowledged\\" as cribbed from Jane Austen's novels (P & P, Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility).<br />TWO: the pastoral mystery.  It is unattributed yet lifted in toto from an arguably obscure Sherlock Holmes story, Arthur Conan Doyle's Boscombe Valley Mystery.<br />Sherlock Holmes sets out the murder scene for Dr. Watson point by point, easy enough to follow for an author in search of a plot.<br /><br />The suspect in Pemberley?  Pride and Prejudice villain--Wickham, casanova di prepubescent females, accused of murdering his best friend.<br />In Boscombe?  the prodigal son is accused of the murder of his father.<br />The complication, in both stories: the suspects confess, wracked with guilt, and they both have blood on their hands.<br /><br />There were no witnesses at either murder scene;  witnesses spoke of incriminating events occurring immediately before the murders.<br />In Boscombe, a gameskeeper saw the victim going towards the woods, and soon after, the son going down that same path, carrying his gun. A violent quarrel was heard but not observed.<br />In Pemberley, the coachman said that after Wickham, Lydia, and Capt. Denny were through carousing at a pub, he drove them towards Pemberley. There was a heated quarrel between these two friends.  Denny got out of the chaise and ran off into the woodland, with Wickham running after him, a shot is heard, and Denny is found dead.<br /><br />The victims lay stretched out on wet grass in an isolated copse, their heads beaten by a heavy and blunt weapon. Remarkably, gunshots had been heard in both incidents, but it was not a gun which killed either. In both stories, the weapon was a slab of stone lying a distance from the body, which sodden discovery had been hampered by the recent rains.<br /><br />The actual assailants in both stories are ostensibly incapacitated, individuals who bear a grudge.<br /><br />Finally, both conclusions echo the authors' disdain of the prevailing criminal justice system.<br /><br />I would suggest that the title be modified and that it appear as Death Comes to Pemberley by Way of the Boscombe Valley.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I liked how creative the plot was. It was a little long-winded, but well worth the read! Interesting concept for sure.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|It took me a bit to get into this book. I would say that I was about half-way through it when I considered not reading it anymore. After I got past that hump, I learned to really like it. Good story and fun read.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|They are dragging out the battle with the governor too much.  They did the same thing with their time on the farm in the last season.  They need to resolve issues and move the plot along.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I just love this series. I can't put it down! Great characters, interesting, keeps you on your feet, good plot!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I learned a lot about how Alzheimer's effects someone from their point of view. In one part of the book Alice says something like she feels board, alone, confused or tired. That is a really important piece of information for the caregiver to think about.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I thought this was a good story overall. It very well could have been written in way less pages, though. That, and I feel like it was so involved and complicated that it was difficult to understand and became boring.
0609610570|5.0|Most people have great ideas and work hard. Unfortunately, that is not enough. This book explains how to make your ideas and hard work show the results you want.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love how these characters evolve. The story gets better and better. It's not what you would expect and, while sad at times, makes you think about how &#34;real&#34; some of the characters really are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have tried the game out and it is really good. What makes it better is the fact that my brother had played this and now it is my task to crush his spirit and achieve the high score. There are loads of unlockable characters and boards. The characters themselves don't seem to have anything special about them. They are just alternate skins but the boards have special abilities. All in all, fun game which test the reflexes as the speed increases.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its okay but not great. would be better if you had more of a choice.<br />3 card would be better the just one card.
B00772M1F6|4.0|When I first heard this CD, immediately thought of Little Richard's classic early rock n roll hits. McPherson channels him to some degree and the band even dresses and performs like a 1950s rock band. It sounds like something teens would dance to and review on the old Dick Clark Show, saying, &#34;It's got a good beat and you can dance to it&#34;
B008NB2GI2|5.0|This is a very well written novel.  In light of the finding of Richard III's remains and the interest, I bought this book.  I enjoyed it for the sheer writing and excellent research.  I would highly recommend this for reading for pleasure or for people who are interested in the medieval period.
B0081X8AE6|4.0|mature, mellow interpretations; soothing, laid back, style...it grows on you with each listening. It has a likeable quality to it
B0046YK4K2|5.0|I have a vinyl record collection of vintage records. When I saw that doo wops and hooligans was available on LP I had to have it. To my surprise it was even an orange colored vinyl record! I can't find anywhere that says it comes in colored vinyl, so I wanted to write a review that let anyone else interested know. The quality and sound is great ad I enjoy every song!!
B00005KAQP|5.0|I purchased this copy for my wife just after seeing the Sister Act broadway show.  There are parts where I laughed out loud.  Whoopie is a great actor.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Hours of fun.  I find myself playing until sunrise. Always a new challenge, lots of great shapes and beautiful tiles.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It is great to have this game on my Kindle.Very handy.Great graphic,s,geart tiles.Easy to see.Any time I want to pass a few minutes ,it is easy to fire up the Kindle and play game or two.I CAN NOT PLAY ONE GAME!!!!!!<br />Hope you buy and enjoy.<br />Boo
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Silvio, your albums are great!!!  I think you should've been famous long ago.  We are lucky someone figured out where you were and out'd you!  I'm seeing you live soon in NYC!  Can't wait!  Keep rocking dude!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting foray into the psyche of a teen with a 'family history'. If you enjoy family genre with murder and trials you will enjoy this book. I am split ergo a 2.5 for me. I enjoyed learning about the psychological battery of tests and results but am not particularly a fan of the bottom line. I also felt I'd read parts of this before or heard some of this in the news.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I got addicted, couldn't put it down. Absolutely epic story, can't wait for the conclusion. Beautifully detailed and grows and expands into an awesome world of a range of all kinds of characters. Definitely recommending this!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I need to mention first i'm not really a Bond fan.  I've seen all the movies, and they were pretty good, but i'm not a true fan.  With that being said, i thought this was a great movie.  I usually find myself checking my watch several times during any movie when things get slow.  Not on this film.  It was engaging from the first moment to the last.  Also, the movie was very visually interesting (urban scenes and countryside).  My husband, 13 year old son and I all really liked this film.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This film is as funny as ever----it does not show its age!  A classic film that was great to see again.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel is great as usual, but the story is really stupid at times.  My husband and I were laughing out loud during a part where Denzel is confined to a guarded hotel room to keep him sober, but he just happens to wake up and find an adjoining door open and a mini-bar full of booze.  Please.  Then, on top of that when they find him laying in the bathroom drunk and bleeding the next morning, a union official and his lawyer ask Denzel's friend to come and give him some lines of coke to straighten him up fast.  Please.  Probably the oddest thing about the movie is that we never really understood whether he was really responsible for the crash or not (which was the main question of the movie).  We thought 'no' based on the review of the plane, but then 'yes' since he kept apologizing to the passengers (whose lives we thought he really saved)...  just confusing and not well written.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This was where the love of writing sci fi came into being for me.  I just love that good vs. evil theme even in the future.  Great stuff.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Good watch for everyday. It is easy to read and set. It is a comfortable watch to wear. I would recomend this watch.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I liked the show.  It was different and the acting was very good.  Can't wait for Season Three.  Thank you.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I thought the special effects were pretty good throughout the movie.  Decent contrast between the two cities, but they could have contrasted the people within the cities a little bit more besides poor and rich.  I was entertained but the ending was a little flat and ended up predictable.  I didn't think too much about whether this was recall or reality that Colin Farrell had just gone through maybe because I'm not a huge Farrell fan or he just delivered a subpar performance. Oh well, 3.5 stars for me
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Movie wasn't all that great but I bought it because Zach was in it.  He's very good as Spock.  Hope the next one will be better.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Anybody would love this movie!!!! Hands down best movie I've ever seen! Being that its a true story makes it even better! Acting was wonderful.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I like his style of singing in that the opera is a change from the rock ballads.  He has a versatile voice, he's not bad looking either.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Was delivered on time as expected. The movie is as I remembered as a child. We purchased this to increase our Disney collection for our daughter.
B005PK553C|5.0|It was such a different show from all the rest of the shows on TV.  Liked it very much.  Thanks.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|As soon as I won an Amazon gift card in a raffle, I knew exactly what I was going to buy: FRIENDS on DVD! Friends is one of my favorite shows, and I hated how it was only on for two hours a day on regular television. Plus, I was too young to appreciate the show when it originally aired, and I knew that there were several episodes which I hadn't seen.<br /><br />I read the reviews prior to purchasing the set, and knew that the sleeves that the discs came in ended up scratching them up so that they would skip around. Therefore, as soon as I got mine, I transferred all the discs to separate sleeves and put the Collector's Box up on a shelf somewhere. I've never had a problem with skipping discs, nor would I say I had any problems whatsoever playing the episodes at all. It does suck that this has to be done, but it was relatively inexpensive and not too difficult.<br /><br />Now that I have the extended versions of the episodes, the commentaries, and all the gag reels, I can't go back to normal FRIENDS on TV! It's too obvious to me which scenes were cut out and what's missing.<br /><br />I took off one star because finding an episode you want to watch is a rather tedious process: Each disc is numbered 1-40, which has nothing to do with which season or episodes are on each one. To find an episode I want to watch, I have to leaf through the booklet that came with the discs, flip to the episode I want, then flip around a few more pages to find out which disc it's on. The book is great, but an awkward size, and not meant to see so much use. Mine is already falling apart at the binding, even though I flip carefully because I'm trying to keep it in good shape.<br /><br />Overall, the product is great, and gets the job done for those who want to watch all the FRIENDS seasons. If they wanted to improve their product, they should change the packaging so the discs don't skip as well as offer a simple leaflet that outlines the seasons/episodes on each disc. The booklet just isn't practical.practical.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These decals are the best that I have found.  You can remove them and place in different areas without damaging the decal or the wall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was not at all what I expected without being a spoiler I can safely say it is a read not to be missed if you saw the movie. Just remember this is book three.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like the game very much. One time I also did some glitch and I ran for a wile with no coins and then randomly the man eating monkey ate me what I was far ahead of him!<br /><br />****Amazon----This is the 3rd time I have had to write to you that I am not writing these reviews.  *****  Please take the steps to remove this as MY review. *****painted_rose
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I haven't go the book completely finished, but so far, I really like it.  I love history and Rutherferd;s books seem to tell the whole story.  His characters are so &#34;real&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We have this app on at least 3 of our android devices and my kids are constantly on them! I've played it and enjoy it myself.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I missed out on this when it first came out, but recently had to watch it for a class. It is now one of my favorite movies of all time.
