B001AIZ5HY|3|thanks
B0052XNOIA|5|I bought this for a 2006 Nissan Xterra which has only a 12\\" rear wiper blade stock. The 16\\" fits perfectly and cleans a much larger area. So far it has been working with no streaks, but it may be necessary to install a stronger spring in the wiper arm for the larger blade.
B0073W281W|5|Looks great on the truck, which is the whole purpose of me buying it. Reception of traditional am/fm radio is not the best, but since I have XM it doesn't matter to me.
B000BYEQG4|5|This is like the best rotor ever.  It is very rotor-y and plays its part in distributing electricity to the various spark plugs in an outstanding manner.
B00BITITKA|4|Good replacement, I had a little bit of trouble getting it into position because additional tabs were added to better secure the handle in the door, which is good.  To line up the screw hole I used a small Torx screwdriver (a small punch will work) to slide the handle into position on the metal mounting bracket inside the door.  The trick is to be sure the handle is pushed in flush and positioned just forward of the metal tabs on the mounting bracket.
B000CIRR06|2|Nice looking steps. Broke 4 bolts while installing (would think they should be stronger than that?) The worse thing about the steps is the oxidation that occurs almost immediately.  I have to use stainless steel cleaner weekly to keep them looking nice.
B000IY9UP4|5|These are exact replacement hood lift supports for my 2000 F250 XLT 7.3L Diesel - no more headaches when working under the hood in cold weather.
B0016GRTVU|4|I have trouble turning the knob on the snowbroom because of my arthritis.  I'm hoping, as I use it, it will become easier to turn.  It will be ideal then.
B00718W5GQ|5|Better than factory
B003V9L05G|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00LKNA5M4|1|These bags lasted two weeks after moving it with groceries the handles came right off.  Not a good deal.
B0012IKASG|5|This was a very dificult buy for me.  It had so many up and down reviews.  I went ahead and bought it thinking that I would not be out of a whole lot of money if it did not work.  I don't use it a whole lot but man it really comes in handy.  For what I paid I am VERY HAPPY.  I am a VFF and it does the job great that I need it to.  I would recomend this to anyone that just needs one to use time to time.  But if you need a unit that is going to get a lot of use, it might be worth spending a little more.
B008TL6RT0|5|After read some users review I though is too risky to buy this device, specially when others users said that they leave connected the ELM327 to the OBDII port and then never worked. This is not the best practice. I have used this device tested for days until my car (kia sorento 2005) fail and with Torque (free version) I found the problem and after repaired and tested then I disconnect the device. The reason for that is if you leave connected, with the time and heat may be damage the ELM even though the case seems is great quality. I found this product very useful.
B001BRYTYY|5|Listen up - if you lease your car or truck - don't buy this air filter.  However, if you own your car or truck, you should run to the computer and purchase this air filter. It is high quality and your engine will last longer.  Also, you will NEVER buy another air filter again - it lasts forever!!  I don't buy into the claims of better mpg, it is almost impossible to verify in a real world situation. That's because you vary the amount of city vs. highway driving that you do. That is the one item that has the biggest effect on you mpg.
B0006Q7H2W|5|Goes on easily with the applicator brush.  Enough for a number of applications.
B004DRWP54|3|The finish was ok but the fit was not. The bulb covers didn't fit right on my set(the black cup on the back of the headlight). one of them popped off in shipping. I took the bulb covers off the old head light and it fit better. But you have to understand these are a quarter of the price of OEM. Plus the car is much safer at night without the old fogged headlights.<br />Over all Good Value!!
B000B8JUH0|1|Put it on and had to ust pliers to get it off.
B00F0MBAAW|5|Nice product, nice price, easy to install with a little mechanical skill. Looks good and came in a reasonable time.
B0002YVIDC|5|This fit perfectly in our trailer.  We went to lowes and homedepot over and over and nothing worked.  We were at the end of our rope and ready to completely remodel the extra bathroom when we found this faucet on amazon.  Works and fits like a dream.  And was cheaper than even a valve at lowes!
B000C55WZQ|5|Moog, never a problem
B00L2CP71M|5|Quick shipping! Easy instructions! Great price!
B002OUQI3W|5|Great idea in hope that someone will be deterred from taking the Surge Guard and cable from the RV.<br /><br />Ray Nelson
B006LRHVZI|5|Fit my 2013 fj cruiser perfect easy to take off and on .it is an awesome product don't search anywhere else best price too
B001KSCSQU|4|quality  part, but wrong one for my series GMC. I have new style 2007 and this is for the earlier body style that also came out in 2007.
B00LMRFJGK|5|I am pleased with the stickers. I like them a lot. 👍
B003NTPE9W|4|Coated really well
B000C5SGBI|5|It's a direct replacement O2 sensor, what more can I say? Picked it up for around ~$55 and that's about half as much as alot of other distributors and brands. I couldn't be happier with the quality and it even came with anti-seize greeze!
B001G9KC1G|5|It's Meguiars, everything they make is great stuff I've never had an complaints about anything the put out, you probably will like it too if you don't already like thier stuff.
B000EQD45S|5|These fit and worked perfectly with 2001 Saturn Coupe...its been 3 weeks and so far so good.  Couldn't be happier.  Great price and product.<br />I highly recommend!
B000K1DUWE|5|After a little tinkering job was completed and the F150 4x4 is now running well.
B00CPL8OVE|5|works
B002WRRNFO|5|Nice
B0002MA3P8|5|I was looking to buy some good fog-lights for my car, I did a lot of research, I was going to go for the Hella FF50, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so the second option was the Optilux 1450, like everyone said these are some pretty good quality fog lamps, they feel sturdy, however I agree with Tito's review, don't remove the black shields, as without them the lamps get very hot and you don't want to blind oncoming traffic, I tried a comparison side by side, one lamp with shield and the other one without it, I couldn't see a mayor difference. The cables are good, the only complaint that I have is the plastic switch, it feels a little cheap, but I'm hopping it will hold up.
B00BGTJDVG|5|Pretty cool decal I have it on the hood of my car.
B002AMAXNA|4|Hope I never have to find out if it works.
B00GWU3N3S|5|I liked it enough that I bought a second one.
B005KW6S6S|5|I have an XTerra and they fit perfectly. The material is great and seems very durable. The fit is perfect and it allows enough for you to adjust it to the size of your seats. Very easy to install, it took my husband and me about half an hr.
B00030BFQA|5|Fast, free shipping and discounted price made for a great value purchase. Have used to charge dual batteries for diesel trucks. Works great! Did not start truck in start mode until 10 minutes of charge on completely dead batteries, but that may be normal for any charger in 200 amp start mode. Casing very thin, and wheels light duty, which is just fine unless you are in an abusive environment. The wheels work fine because the unit is not very heavy. I am very happy with this unit and would highly recommend it so long as you know how to calculate how long to charge your batteries (although the timer could have a larger time range for charging dual, parallel connected batteries). This is a manual charger that you can set the charge time for up to 2-1/2 hours at user selectable 40 or 2 amps. I don't trust my memory to leave it charge in continuous mode.
B00AKWSSCU|4|Does what it says.  Keeps bags in place and is useful for storage of trash in bags in car out of the way
B00F6RC4JC|1|I have discovered that these are not the right voltage for my 2002 Civic.  After buying OEM bulbs I found my instrument cluster would light up, with these 2/3 would not no matter how I danced them around the sockets.
B00S8KQAUS|4|Easy to install and a great upgrade to the crappy cloth seats in my new-to-me used car cloth seats. Not the greatest quality but for the price for front and back seats it was great. Already saved me from a few spills. I did have to cut holes in the back for the seatbelts. My back seats didn't fold down but I just tucked everything in and I haven't had any problems even with 9 year old twins.<br />I like the sporty look to them.
B000CSQETQ|2|I ordered two of these parts. Both my the same 'brand' Original Engine Management, but one was made in the US and the other in Taiwan. They had different boxes, same info on the boxes though. Also, one of them was DOA, while the other works fine. The one from Taiwan actually works, while the one from the US was DOA.<br /><br />The internals of these coilpacks are slightly different from the OEM coilpacks, on these there is a spring that goes around the spark plug, on the originals there is a flat disc that contacts the top of the spark plug. They function essentially the same though.
B000LY5KBO|5|These bars are beautiful! Well made, easy to install, and make the Avalanche look so much nicer.
B004AIG714|5|Works like a charm!
B001GF7MJA|4|What I like:<br /><br />1) inexpensive compared to accordion style.<br />2) does it's job well.<br />3) the custom fit is nice, though being of the roll up variety, it tends to bow in the middle a bit, but this hasn't dampened its ability to keep the heat to a minimum.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />1) rolling it up is a bit of a pain.  not sure if the folding kind would have been a better choice, but it was cheaper, so there's a price for less money.<br />2) the cut out around the rear view mirror could stand to be smaller to eliminate more sunlight.<br />3) bows in the middle a bit, but bit so much that it keeps it from functioning properly.
B000JFJLP6|5|Have been using this for over a couple of months now and as the title says am a satisfied customer and will recommend the product to anyone.<br /><br />My car battery started acting up on me after I came back from a month long international trip, I got stuck twice in the morning to work and once from work late in the night. It was frustrating and painful. Hence I decided to buy this product and boy it saved me like 5-8 times already, it came in fully charged and I haven't charged it yet after receiving it. Jump started my car every time on the first attempt and with no issues what so ever.<br /><br />I finally figured out the problem with the car battery to a iPhone car charger/radio kit connected to the car. Haven't had the need to use it in the last two weeks, but I know it will not fail me if I need it.<br /><br />I think the shipping and delivery was un-eventful so that good.<br /><br />Thanks, hope some one finds the review useful, I spent a full 10 mins writing it :)<br /><br />Update 13/8/2013. Okay I still have it in my car and even tough I did not have to use it for my car in the last year or so, it helped me play good samaritan twice in the last year once with some guy stuck near Walmart and another family near Borders in Sunnyvale. Recommended to both of them to get this unit and stop getting stuck :)
B00CZNILXS|1|This is real frustrating to install on those cheap scooters. Buy a japanese scooter and save yourself time and money in the long run. I see these chinese scooters dead with under 1000 miles pretty often. DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!
B0068ESK1I|5|excellent straps for motocross tie downs!!!!!!  Update, been using for the past year and the straps are still preforming perfectly!!!!
B000AM8BCC|4|my 3ltr jaguar x type was consuming a litre of oil every 1400 miles no smoke or leaks jaguar dealer informed me this was within exceptible limits I was still concerned that this was to high I had known about restore but had my doubts if it would work anyway I put a 400 ml can in to try which is 200ml short of whats recommended have so far covered 850 miles and just topped up with 250ml of oil a vast improvement its expensive but any one with high oil consumption I would say give it a try
B005BNZ6WI|4|I've had one of these for years.  Use it constantly for oil disposal.  So convenient to get rid of the grease mess.
B001U7SYK0|5|I have two of them, and they work great, and have very good quality.  Itossed out the Chinese knock offs that I bought (plus the knockoffs actually ended up being shipped from china (an undisclosed unpleasant surprise) and took for ever to arrive).
B001UMZ07A|5|I have to admit this is a lot of work but the results are totally worth it.  Make sure you wear gloves.... make REALLY sure you wear gloves... but once you get done with this system you'll be thrilled with the way your car looks.
B003VC97N0|4|Ease of both use and installation. Makes access to and changing your oil a snap. Very well made and great time saver.
B00VF7HZF0|1|Usp  didn't work very cheap
B00L4V9ECY|5|2001 Chevy Silverado - Once I figured out which wires to hook them up to they've worked great! It took me a little time to find what wires were what on my truck too. Not the products fault and haven't had any problems since I've installed them.
B002PQWBR2|5|The fitment was great, and they went on with no issues. flush fit and great quality for the price
B000H0QRLY|4|Worked great for a light for our speed boat when were out on the water. Not super bright but allowed us to navigate when it was getting dark to get back to camp. Has a good light beam and flood pattern. Was perfect to be able to plug into our cigarette lighter and have a spot on our speed boat to  return back to our house boat. We also used it several times to see around camp at night. Could be brighter though. Especially with led technology on the rise.
B00A0J00UQ|5|used on evo 8! powerrrr
B003GLH9BS|5|Nice little bathroom add to keep unappetizing smells away. Each can pretty much does go about 1500 sprays and keeps the paint from peeling off the toidy walls. I buy the six pack so we're never without. And for this, my entire family is grateful!
B0009IQZRK|5|Excellent filter - Very happy to see they are made in U.S.A.<br />and not outsourced like many other products these days.
B002LM4HYA|1|Absolute garbage. You won't fix a single hole with this. We don't know if there are better patch kits on the market, but this one is a complete waste of time and money. There should be an option for zero stars.
B000ALG8LO|4|I buy a lot of JB weld in this size.  A year ago this would be a five star review.<br /><br />However, two cautions:<br /><br />1) The last batch was either a change in formulation or a quality issue.  The white hardener is normally about the slightly stiff consistency as the black epoxy.  This time it was a much more water-like consistency, with the black epoxy its usual stiffer consistency.  Still worked, but this makes putting out equal amounts more difficult.<br /><br />2) The price has escalated by about $3
B0095XSDIY|5|Thank you...
B00G85NPIU|5|The delivery time was really fast. The build quality is pretty good considering the price of the item. Only one minor drawback is that the screw (at least in my case) stays slightly outside and is visible at close look. Overall, I am really satisfied with these stem caps.
B00BCAY5XU|5|it was very easy to apply and fast shipping. low price with high quality. will be a returning customer for sure
B0002U1TX0|5|great product
B002E5HMT6|4|Nice replacement part. Only about a 45 minute change out on an S70
B00BFDJ9N0|5|As far as the reviews go, this was exactly what was described on amazon.  My mechanic was shocked that I purchased it through Amazon and got the right part.  This was highly recommend by a Honda Certified Technician and I'm looking forward to years of great performance from these brake pads
B009RYXPSE|5|perfecto
B007LIBYTA|5|Perfect
B001EWM16E|5|I don't know what the first reviewer is talking about... but it did make me think twice about purchasing this. I'm truly thrilled I bought this. The quality easily matches that of the OEM emblems and lettering on any car.<br /><br />The photo for the listing doesn't really do this justice. It really looks good. A little bigger than I expected but no complaints here!
B000E4IHHU|5|For an item made in Taiwan, this is surely a high quality piece, exceeded my expectations by far, go for it!
B004WP9S0C|5|My girlfriend love's it!!!
B00B5FJP0A|5|This is an OEM Mazda accessory and comes with all the quality one would expect. They are a perfect fit and look pretty classy. The adhesive on the back has not come off after 8 months..
B004ZF43Y0|5|Easy installation, quality product & fast shipping.  Huge difference with these HID's vs. the factory halogen set up.
B00514AHSU|3|I ordered these for the Stratoliner which it said it would fit. I have an oil cooler on one side and the exhaust on the other blocked it from being able to fit. The lights seemed okay, but in my opinion not worth the money. If you are considering these type of lights and have a engine guard, I would order the ones that fit onto the guard. After getting these and then sending them back, I just when and had the brighter headlights installed and the driving light replaced.<br /><br />WM
B0023VIFQ0|5|PRODUCT IS THE PERFECT REPLACEMENT THAT IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
B000EQCV8E|5|We have always turned to Monroe for high quality shocks and struts at a lower price...and now they offer these awesome shock absorbers for our more extreme clients. Their monotube shock is very competitive with the other higher priced performance shocks. Our clients are happy with them...<br /><br />Thanks Monroe,<br />Jeff Laney<br />International Automotive Resources LLC
B004NLZQ06|5|Perfect fit and super easy to install.  Make my 03 Av look like new again!
B0048EGPPS|5|Great product
B0023VFIC4|5|Exactly what I needed. An the best price ever!
B000CC0HZ4|5|Perfect for my purpose, fits between the hooks in the back seat of my auto, to keep my clothes clean, neat and still on their hangers.  No more wrinkles.
B0089K6BS8|5|New with key blank which dealer wanted $80 , dealer had no problem programming I would have no problem with ordering again
B006CUPMKA|3|looks like good product I am installing it this weekend<br /><br />I am sure it will work fine blah blah b;lah
B000C59Y3M|5|Not OEM but sure does fit like OEM. The quality of the part felt and looks good. The included grease fitting was a little tight but I got it to fit. I replaced this after a recommendation from a local shop when they did my alignment. Took me a bit of time and a trip to auto parts store for a idler arm puller and another trip to the hardware store for a 12x1.75 metric nut (non-locking) to seat the arm on the relay rod. On the '97 S10 2.2L, torque the 12x1.75 nut to 40Ft.Lbs. This will seat the idler arm on the relay rod ball joint stud taper. Remove the nut, and install the included lock nut and torque it to 35Ft. Lbs. (Tq specs are according to AllDataDIY.com) My steering is now tight again. Before I had a lot of slop (2&#34; or so) in the steering wheel. I feel like I have better control of the truck now.
B00EKSRB5U|4|used it on a 2000' Chevy S10 throttle body (2.75&#34;) to connect to an aftermarket 3&#34; aluminum CAI intake tube.  It's a genuine 4 layered silcone hose section and holding up well!
B00H34DIDM|5|As a first time user of this product, I was somewhat skeptical.<br /><br />I am glad to report that the product performed extremely well for my situation.<br />I reside in the pacific northwest and after leaving my car parked for several months, I came back to a vehicle with significant mold growth on the combination cloth and leather seats.<br /><br />After treating the mold with a mold 'cleaner', I cleaned the leather with this product.<br /><br />My wife says the car is cleaner than a new car.  Previously, she wanted to sell the car.<br /><br />...enough said.
B00DMEFH7W|3|Install was easy and it even had a booklet with the link to a really short instruction video. The material feels a bit &#34;cheap&#34; but I haven't had any problems with rips or wear yet, except on the straps. IF YOU PULL THE ELASTIC STRAPS THEY WILL RIP.
B001G5W3AS|5|Thank you!!
B001PYCU8K|5|Perfect fit
B004J2UUXW|5|It replace my 2001 Alero fuel pump no problem.
B000GTY17S|5|All good
B000IY80S2|5|These were an exact fit replacement on my 2009 Nissan Xterra. The old discs had to be hammered off (no screw holds them on) due to a little rust, but these slipped on easy. There's nothing earth shattering to say about them, after all they are just discs, but they went on easy and are working as expected. I'd recommend them.
B0027QWNGO|5|Great price, very sturdy product, very well made....highly recommend to anyone...am using my to store handgun.  Has bottom pocket to store items seperatly from top section.
B00GZLMEPM|5|The kit arrived ahead of time. It completely cleared the yellowing on the headlight covers. Wow, a product that does what it promises.
B00HJ1592C|1|All the stones fell off before too long!!!
B004FEI59A|5|Installed on an old John Deere 526, 5hp snowblower, H50 Tecumseh engine. Started right up after I cleaned the carb.
B00U7FG0JS|3|I have a 2014 Tundra SR5. Install was easy but you do need load resistors. Reason for 3 stars is LEDs are only blue when I have all headlights on so it kinda gets drowned out. They are amber when I have only DRLs so it doesn't look any different than the stock bulbs. I wanted it to be blue at all times until I used my signal/hazards. Other than that they look fine and switch back and forth as needed.<br /><br />Photos:<br />Truck is on.<br />First pic. Lights all the way off. LED shows up amber.<br />Second pic. First click on headlight switch. Side marker comes on. LED amber.<br />Third pic. Headlights all the way on. LED is blue.
B00QVT2UHK|5|Upon looking at this, it seems very durable for its use. The nice red color offers an easy sight when you may become in distress. I am the type of person when in a situation that is stressful, I find it hard to find a train of thought. The flashlight is very bright and nice and the screen is very easy to read for tire pressure. When used in comparison with my other one that I know is top notch, this was right up there with it for accuracy. As far as the seat belt cutter and the window hammer, I haven't used it to be honest. I am sure they are nice and work appropriately however. The compass is very nice as well, and can really become a valuable asset if you shall become lost. I really like this device as it offers me a piece of mind that I am at least taking some emergency measure in case of the worst scenario of things.  Only thing I could find to pick at is that you have to provide your own AA batteries (needs two), but what comes with batteries anymore anyways?
B00AC6SAZE|5|I love my new roadking  headset it works great!
B007TY2NU0|5|Arrived within estimated time. Installed easily.  No complaints. If the other side ever needs replaced I'll order it from here
B002P3KJLU|4|Great size for having near my water spigot that the builder put so close to the ground I can't fill a water can under it. This give me the flexibility to<br />fill my watering can or anything else with ease. Good quality ends and nice flexible hose.
B00FDRLMF2|5|Worked just like the original in my 2013 Santa Fe.  Much better than paying the dealer $700 to replace it. Everything lined up perfectly.
B000BYB2J8|5|It is one of the best windshield wipers I used so far. It really helps me see the road lot better compares to the regular windshield wipers.
B005DJFXY6|4|Not the best quality but sufficient
B008KUYFSU|5|Soft leather, Comfortable, and warm. Love them!
B000CSD29Q|4|Worked like it was designed too
B0049KXF4A|3|The plastic wheel covers do not stay on.  The original factory wheel covers came off so the replacement covers were the same quality.  This was definitely a Nissan design problem.  The solution was easy.  I traded the Nissan Versa in with the new wheel covers in the back storage area.  I noe have a new Toyota Venza.  They did not have plastic wheel covers.
B002UC2UTK|3|Used these to make my own folding card table out of unused dining table leaves.  A little wobbly side to side, but lock out nicely and got the job done.
B00TYZLD9O|2|It doesn't even come close to fitting the vehicle for which it was purchased, but does fit a Toyota RAV4 perfectly - and works very well in that vehicle. Rating is low to reflect the fact I can't get ahold of the company, and the for for the intended vehicle - NOT the product, itself. Im lucky to have another vehicle where it can be used.
B00HUUMCVI|3|It's a nice fender. Could've been better if the top didn't have a big dent.
B0054YCW62|5|Great spare for truck. Use the heck out of first 1 I purchased....
B001GFV23W|5|Perfect N easy fit, that's the way a product should meet the expectations of the customer. No need to say that i will go back for my next purchase!!!
B005S0B5TC|5|Very good
B001KNYT1M|5|I purchased these to replace the front rotors on my 2010 Honda Pilot.  I immediately noticed smoother braking.  I've only had these for 2 months so I'll come back and update my review after I've had these a while.
B00BTGSGFK|5|These are an absolute must for applicating on larger surfaces.  It will not only save you time with how much quicker it helps you applicate, but it will give you peace of mind knowing that the material is not damaging your leather.<br /><br />the spongy nature of it allows for a good mix of applicating and distribution.  My doctor would probably recommend these 9.8 times out of 10.
B005KDOAGC|4|Don't touch the bulb! (Obviously) otherwise a bulb will burn out and you'll be ordering a second pair soon. Not the manufacturers fault. Difficult to install on many vehicles (tad bit difficult on n my 2012 Honda accord lx-s) which causes chances of oil getting on the bulb to skyrocket. Great product. Bright White/blueish light. Improves visibility and aesthetic stock look. Just be careful! Use gloves and plan the path to the socket before you try and install!
B001AIZ5HY|4|Worked very good. Just take your time. For really bad headlights I've recommend buying some courser sandpaper, like 180, and hand sanding to get all the pitting and discoloration out first before going through the progressively finer sandpapers in this kit.
B00KN0UOEE|5|works well .. quality product .. use it on vinyl and tires ..very expensive when shipping to Canada
B005JQNPG6|5|The Camco sway control system is easy to install and use.  A must have for pulling trailers prone to side load gusting winds.  Helps keep the load straight.
B001THRG9Q|5|As advertised
B008X033CQ|5|Works great easy install took 15 min
B0042A2V88|2|Luckely I bought two because the switch will break easily.<br />I can still activate it using a small pen. ok otherwise.
B00MJFP8VA|5|Worked perfectly.  No problems replacing the OEM bolts when swapping out for a rebuilt head.
B007JCIARC|1|I ordered the sticker and its not the same as it is in the picture the sticker that I have does not have the heart. I feel like the time that I waited for that sticker I should get free ones
B000W0RQ8C|5|Worked great on my 2006 tundra
B009M5PTV4|5|Good Item
B00E1D1GY6|5|great product does the job just what i was hoping for
B004ZF4RXC|4|Very good quality kit! Very easy install, very bright, awesome color light. My one main con is the way the kit is packaged, why send it in that nice metal case and not use it properly. The equipment is jist tossed in it and my bulbs didn't even have plastic covers, just Styrofoam wrap, disappointing.
B00BEKR27E|5|Loving the makeover I gave my Genesis. It's no longer just &#34;another Hyundai&#34;!
B00EM9E4HU|5|excellent,  best ever.  I put them around mi car, it looks terrific
B003XU6GYI|5|My boyfriend rides motorcycles...  These were perfect for his<br />hands.  The length helps to keep the cold winds from creeping<br />into his clothing!
B009R6T9D2|5|The Porsche Oil Travel bag securely holds a one quart bottle of oil. It's nicely made in vinyl with a seemingly sturdy zipper. There is velcro on the back so it will stick to the carpeted side walls in the trunk. Inside there's a small pocket and a paper funnel and plastic gloves are tucked inside. I use it in my MK6 GTI to carry an extra bottle of the way-too-hard-to-find Castrol oil that VW wants me to use. It's stuck to the sidewall of the trunk behind the driver's side rear wheel housing.This way, I have my oil when I check my level at the gas station. Not that I have to add oil often, but it's good to have with just in case. Highly recommended, and you can easily blow $18 on dumber things.
B000WLEIN2|3|Jacket is well vented. The pads are not placed exactly where you might need them but with a little adjustment you can get them right. The leather needs a lot of work to get some flexibility in it.
B000X9EGFS|5|I love how this shuts off automatically! One odd thing: the air gun came with a note attached which said not to use it on portable compressors. I called Viair and found out that this air gun cannot be used on other units and it's made for this 450p-a only. No worries! I plan to have this well-made compressor many years! On to the Moab Jeep Safari!
B0088SKFD8|5|These work great!! Super happy with them!!!
B00CSEEOU8|5|Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition. It is just as it appears in the photo
B007D5DB88|4|I have the atm micro fuses so this sticks out a good bit higher than the others but there is enough clearance in my fuse box to make it work fine.<br />2006 Titan<br />Ran the power cord from the monitor (rear view mirror / back up cam) through the head liner molding to the passenger side.  Down to the inside fuse box below the glove box.  No exposed wire except an inch or two just above the rear view mirror.<br />Easy.<br />Skill level 1.5 out of 10.
B00NNYLBS0|5|Excellent for my 335xi
B002K3Y3X0|5|Excellent product works efficiently at a very reasonable price
B000EBONXK|5|It's a great product, I wish it had more slots though to put CD's in but that isn't the products fault it's just the one I chose to buy. Also I bought the matching seat covers which are cute and exactly what I was looking for so all is well. I'd recommend.
B000CAZ530|5|This filter is a couple bucks cheaper than most auto parts store sold air filter and fits my Lexus LS430 as expected. I'm also trying a similar filter [[ASIN:B000C9VTHC ACDelco A2969C Air Filter]] for this year's 2013 filter change. Check out my free how to video on YouTube to see how easy it is to change your Lexus air filter, by FunkyMechanic [search for \\"ls430 2001 air filter replacement\\"]. Enjoy.
B002XFI598|5|I am anticipating people getting angry with me about these lights being so bright.  They are brighter than my LED reverse lights, just keep the brakes on slightly and they will light the way.  They come with a rubber housing and I am a bit worried that it may start to wear and the light could come out a bit easier, but a little glue would fix that if it becomes a problem.  The connector is a bit difficult to see which wire is which but it can be figured out easy enough.
B003V9Y2II|1|This tire pressure guage cost me a  motorcycle tire.  I was constantly reading 10 to 15psi less than actual pressure, even after calibrating it.  After several months of riding like that I decided to try my friends guage and it was indeed over inflated and now I have a bulge in my tire and I'm sure it's due to running with too much air pressure.  Do not buy this it will ruin your tires.
B005J083OQ|5|Perfect replacement for the Helo 133K83B Center Cap.
B00HHG910A|1|After  other reviews  about  customers experiencing this key finder beeping for no reason, for some strange reason I ignored the warning and bought this. At first it rarely beeped on its own...but over time, it increased in frequency...now it is driving me crazy..after the 30 day return period. Now its trash and whole investment lost. Why does this seller continue to sell a defective product?
B00AO04VCY|5|Can't beat these for the money. Installed LED's throughout my Mini-Van and it makes an incredible difference.  Purchased another set for my SUV.  Easy install even if you have to angle them slightly to fit.
B002P8WYRC|4|I got this after someone hit my mirror on new years at some point during the night and needed a replacement. It was fairly simple to replace, just had to remove the door panel and then use 2 different types of torq then you are in. It took me maybe 45 minutes in total to replace it and I had to run in to grab more tools twice. The only screw that is difficult is the one in the upper right of the panel which is near the dash. I used a small philips for this, but not everyone may have one of those.<br /><br />There was a rubber piece provided that I am not sure what it was for, but I old one didn't have one. And the fact that you can't get the color you need for your car is kind of a bummer.
B0060A8SLC|5|Perfect just what I needed and the price was right!! FAst shipping
B004HYRIBE|5|nothing bad to say only that it fit good and was easy to install. looks like it was install by the dealer.
B0002JMIEK|5|Very good product.  Hope it last at least 1 year.
B009JQ9W82|3|Standard red LED bulbs. Adequately bright, but not worth the extra expense versus other red LEDs.
B00065L2D8|5|This is put together well. Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I can
B003L643KS|2|It now has a short in it for some reason and it works and then it doesn't
B002XL2IEA|4|This worked great for blowing down my travel trailer plumbing. I used it at about 30-35 psi so as not to stress plumbing joints but you probably could go higher. Check with manufacturer of your unit. They also make one of these with a valve exactly like a bicycle air valve that works great with a clamping chuck. Got out every bit of water before I winterized.
B0081S9E1O|5|great price, fast shippine
B00EHIPITY|1|Worked for about a month then went bad . Will not buy from them again.
B00CEXK402|5|fit better than the one from VW
B004WMDXRE|5|Surprisingly great for an aftermarket part. That being said not perfect but when the only other option is to buy the door panel from chevy you cant beat the value. Relatively easy install as well.
B0018OBG3C|5|Great product.  Matches my 2000 Silverado interior quite well.  Fit very well also.  An amazing amount of storge space...more than I had expected.
B000L2LRVI|2|It is a defective design. The metal body where the o-ring resides does not provide a proper surface for the o- ring. Instead the o-ring resides on the male threads for the screw cap.  The threads cut into the soft rubber o-ring and the o-ring can not sit straight.    You can not see the threads under the o-ring in the sellers photo, so I am letting you know. The threads go all the way to the hilt.   When you screw on the cap it does not seal properly to the o-ring and further presses and scrapes the o-ring on the sharp threads.  This cuts the o-ring with use.  When I received the oiler I was amazed such an obvious defect was not addressed in the design.  It is rare that I am unhappy with an Amazon order.
B000NJOUAO|1|I bought a pair of these on a &#34;limited&#34; sale and they sat in my closet for about 6 months as I didn't want to wear them until my bates boots were shot. It was immediately clear that the sizes don't run true, returned them (29.00 shipping) and got another size. Then when I finally start to wear them the leather peals and the heels start to separate in the middle of the heel itself. cant return because they only warranty them a year. Buy good boots, not &#34;Milwaukee&#34;
B0040IV0Y8|5|I searched the internet and was confused if the pictures were accurate until I found this on Amazon. I have a 2004 Ford F-150 Heritage model and this fit perfectly on my tire, with virutally no work, just had to line up the holes. I put the order in and received the replacement via mail in approx 2-3 days. Hope this review helps someone in a similar situation.
B00F2NHVX4|5|Excellent product.  Does what it is suppose to do.
B0017OFS7S|4|Product is as expected. I would purchase this again if I have a bulb that needs to be replaced. It is bright.
B0052O8DCG|5|Easy install. Looks and fits great
B000LG9IF6|1|The remote barley works may need new better, that why I have one star. If just a battery I change rating.
B0070328VE|2|with the other pictures i thought that the engine came with the kit... it was only the engine and it didnt even include the carburator???
B00KFHZ4JK|5|perfect
B0007N20H6|5|works good.  better than expected. easy to handle and store. takes up less space on windshield. recommend this product for replacement of any other toll klip holder.
B000PGEMQM|4|This was fairly easy to apply, and doesn't show on plastics immediately- but it will eventually.  A few washes after it was applied I began to notice where I had gotten it on the black plastic bits, and noticed that it was very difficult to remove.  Not a tragedy, but a bit of annoyance from an otherwise great product.
B0001EFSTI|5|It can do all the things it says in the blurb, the only issue I forgetting I have it on my keys and as I regularly travel through security that can be an issue.
B000NVW1LM|4|only reason im not giving it  5 stars because its more on amazon than in the store but the seal truly works only is your oil has drips coming from it just follow directions and drive the car constantly and you will see the results
B002GT78GW|5|A true statement, will look good on the back side of the Off road beast, getting alot of good attention
B000JMFK36|4|This jacket is beautifully made. I bought the matching chaps and they have served me well with thousands of miles on them ( I ride a street bike) however the pink did fade out a bit fast for my taste. I have had no problems with the workmanship however. It comes with a removeable lining that is very soft and comfortable and the jacket is lined withthe same silk pink material that the removeable liner is made of. No protective armor however which is a safety issue if you use it for motorcycle riding.
B0016I0BA4|5|Excellent
B000GV58S2|1|This pad does nothing to ease the ride????? After about 30 minutes riding my motor cycle with the pad, my backside hurts as much as it did without it. I spent over $100.00 for nothing?????
B00AMQG0Z6|5|Good
B000F5JM0O|5|good tool
B00MNN16GY|5|Great value for the price, and it's nice to get a varity pack if you can't settle on one. Only time will tell how long they last, but so far so good, car smells fresh!
B00142X118|1|I ordered these in September about a week after I ordered my 2013 JK.  I didn't open the box until after the vehicle arrived on Oct. 31.  Much to my surprise, these are not made out of the same material that previous flares were.  I had Bushwacker pocket-style flares on my '03 TJ.  The material was thick, sturdy and looked great.  These new ones are thin, brittle and very cheap looking...no where near as sturdy as the OEM fenders.  In addition, Bushwacker's description is \\"matte black\\".  These are a shiny, textured, hard plastic.  I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  That's how bad they looked.  They totally suck...and Amazon's allowable return date has passed...so it would cost me $140 UPS shipping fees to return them and I would only get 80% of my purchase price back.  Steer clear of these new Bushwackers.
B00K889FCI|5|I am completely pleased with this product.
B000GZAU5O|5|I purchased a set of these for my 4.3 V6 Silverado. I noticed a difference immediately. Easier starts and more pickup and power. I replaced a set of Autolite. I have not had a chance to check fuel economy yet, but will post my results when I get that completed.
B004SCYMRI|5|Great price on a very good product!
B000IYY78Y|4|OK but dusty
B001A0N7CM|2|I BOUGHT THIS ITEM ALONG WITH A K SOURCE 8 INCH MIRROR.IT IS A BASIC MOUNTING PLATE WITH DOUBLE SIDED FOAM TAPE ON THE MOUNTING SIDE.THE TAPE BEGAN TO GIVE WAY AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF DRIVING.A COUPLE OF BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND IT FELL OFF.IF ALL YOU NEED IS A PLATE THIS IS FINE,BUT IF YOU NEED AN ADHESIVE,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOME GLUE!NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE K SOURCE MIRROR HOWEVER.
B0009IK9DG|5|The bristles are very soft and packed densely - but soap still clings to them and they're still stiff enough to scrub wheels. Simple, light, and highly recommended.
B001G6LXUI|5|Excellent
B0067ECRP4|4|Good: After a little research I found that K&N oil filters do not use paper media like many popular oil filters such as FRAM, this paper can come apart and harm your engine. With FRAM I heard the slightest knock until the engine was warm as if there wasn't sufficient oil flow and have not heard that with the K&N. I really think this product will be the one I choose from now on.<br /><br />Caution: K&N sells a &#34;Performance Wrench Off&#34; filter that they make sound better than this filter, comes with a nut on the end so you can use a standard wrench to remove it and cot TWICE as much or more. The specs look exactly the same as this one and after e-mailing K&N's tech department asking if there is any difference or will I just pay twice as much for a nut, they never responded. This tells me you pay twice as much for a nut. I have had no problem removing this oil filter with my hand as you should only hand tighten them anyway, but do wish they would put the rubberized material on it like FRAM for just a little more grip, but if they did that they might not talk you into spending TWICE as much for a stupid nut.
B002QGVW3K|5|good
B000182DXI|5|Installed on 2000 Excursion it looks great and works great. Mine came chrome not with gold trim. As pictured.
B00080QHMM|5|I really like this tire pressure gauge, especially since the read-out is big and bright enough to see in full daylight...which can be a problem with other brands of gauges.
B00KIERDDU|5|Outstanding Product. Very Bright.
B0009TAOBC|5|quality piece
B007QV0R7W|5|I have previous experience using this tool, in both school and professionally.  I love it.  I pick up this before a DMM anyday.  Although a DMM have some extra functions you can't get with a Power Probe, I definitely grab this tool more often.  I recommend this to any automotive technician that does electrical work.
B009DJQ7QU|5|i love my new headlight, it matches the driver side light. however i wish it would have came with the cornering light like my driver side one, but other than that i absolutely love it! and the installation was very very very simple
B00JF5HR7K|5|heavy duty and big.
B005OAT9BC|5|excelente
B004N2TJVC|4|Be prepared to do some grinding of at least 1/8-1/4 inch off of your crossmember before getting starter to fit an F-250. Once you finally get this starter in, it does an awesome job of turning the motor over to get started!
B0030G7Y64|5|works as advertised, is very good and does not use much power, make sure you pre cool
B00KD3ZKIQ|5|[[VIDEOID:1af5e29a70b6ac569367d1953932eae2]]Abrams at its finest once again!<br /><br />This is a lengthy review:<br />This light is an amazing combination of features that are highly adaptable and can be an excellent addition to any emergency vehicle, from the rear of a fire apparatus to the POV of a volunteer responder. It is extremely bright and adaptable to any purpose ranging from the emergency field to construction. There are many advantages that this light offers that you just cant get anywhere else. It has made an excellent edition to my POV for fire/EMS runs and adds another key layer of safety when responding to calls as well as on roadway scenes.<br />Between the directional capabilities, the multiple professional flash patterns, the brightness, and the multiple color combinations, this bar is guaranteed to demand the attention of other drivers to your presence and give time for reaction. Just to list a few:<br /><br />1). This bar can be mounted internally within a vehicle such as in the back glass of a truck as well as externally such as on a cab rack or as a directional bar on a fire apparatus.<br />2). This bar does not come with the traditional cigarette plug on/off switch and pattern selector (For fair warning). It comes with a control box that allows for the abilities to turn the bar on/off, pattern selection, and color selection. Colors can be be set in different combinations between the three colors ordered or they can be set to cycle through each color on the pattern selected. It also shows which colors are flashing and what pattern is selected.<br />3). It is extremely bright, thanks to the amazing work on behalf of Abrams and their optic design. It makes a perfect match with any set of Abrams lights such as the newer Thundereye light bar in the 18&quot;, 27&quot;, and 48&quot; sizes with their 3 watt bulbs. The way these bars are designed makes them much brighter than any competitor light bars that I have used.<br />4). One thing that I like about this light, as well as all other Abrams products that I own, is that this bar has mobility and can be easily moved from one vehicle to another (not including lights in a permanent mount location) at a moments notice. For example, my bar is located internally the back glass of the cab of my POV  behind the headrests. If something were to happen to my POV, I could easily transfer this bar to another vehicle like my other lights to put myself back in service. Keep in mind this is dependent on how you decide to mount this.<br />5). Mounting brackets and hardware are included with this bar. The ONLY disadvantage with this bar is that its diameter is a tad bit large. But there are no complaints because it is very sturdy in construction.<br />6). Not so much as a physical attribute, but if something were to array, Abrams has has amazing customer service and warranties. In the past they have proven to be very helpful and care about their customers. From experience of buying from other vendors and brands, this company by far is the easiest to work with and supportive.<br /><br />Be aware, there are two chords that come out of the backside of the bar. One side is the power chord that can connect to a cigarette lighter plug or can be wired to any positive/negative power source. The other side is the chord that will connect to the control box. Both ends have plenty of chord length.<br /><br />This bar is highly effective and bright both during daytime and night time use. There are plenty of times that I have had to stop to clear debris from a roadway during the day or check on stranded motorists at the side of the road at night, and in all cases this light has helped to alert and clear traffic to give me space to work safely. I highly recommend this product, as well as any other Abrams product, to anyone needing emergency or construction lighting from volunteers to anyone needing lighting on company vehicles. This product has been discontinued in production so there is limited supply left. This is a must grab! Pictures and video of this bar in action will be posted in the near future.
B00684TIVE|5|After 9 years I needed to replace my original key fobs for my 2004 Titan. One I seem to have lost but they both had broken plastic and it was only a matter of time until the final plastic holding the key ring was going to break.....received quickly and easy to program once I got the vehicle to recognize the programming sequence.
B005ESNRL2|4|Super cute! Super useless...
B007Y86LRM|5|I'm giving this a 5 star for an amazingly fast delivery on a starter that is not a prime shipping product. I trust it will work if it doesn't I will adjust my rating accordingly. Wish me luck on the install?<br />Update: after watching some instructional YouTube videos I took out the old one and put the new starter and put it back together. It started right up I'd say almost over zealously. The sound of the starter is like a growl.
B00GUF74HQ|5|I think this is truly the best accessory Ive bought for my truck. Every pickup truck should have one. It took me literally less then 10 mins to install. All you need is a 10mm and 13mm wrench. It was purchased and delivered in less than 48 hrs. Real happy !!
B000MU8XI4|5|Someone will REALLY need to want my bike to get through this. It's also long enough to use large trees, which normal locks wouldn't be able to wrap around. It is even big enough for two bikes if the tree isn't too thick.
B00341MIAW|5|Very nice.....
B000CQFWZK|5|It is what it is and it works. *Take note that the nozzle tip is adjustable as far as the angel. (1.) Push in nozzle tip and turn to desired angel. (2.) Pull out nozzle tip for tight seal.
B00ECOJYXY|3|all blue parts are individual pieces so when you pull it off shipping plastic it does not all come off, so you have to re-asemeble the product.
B009LPYHI6|1|2007 zx6r. Way too short. I had the lever adjustment bolt all the way in and the clutch housing bolt all the way out, couldn't even turn my wheel left. To return it I get only about 5 dollars back due to shipping and re labeling cost. Do not buy
B000TYQB14|5|Works good, fits like oem
B000E35UV2|5|Great price and easy to install
B000PWZR4C|1|Second time I ordered one and it doesn't work
B00F9LPJ8S|2|Not a direct replacement battery for Suzuki Intruder 1400/1500. Will need to use angle brackets to rotate the terminal attachment . It did work on an atv that I needed to replace a battery on and it cranks a ton!
B00K87WD8C|4|it was everything we needed.
B0017KJ0A8|3|I purchased this for my Ranger, doesn't fit. It's threaded and my truck is not. Now it'll cost as much as the knob to return. Stuck with it I guess. Maybe i'll drill it out or something...
B003UM9GDM|5|I used this jack on my GSXR 1000 and 600. I also used this to remove the transmission on my truck. This is a good strong jack.
B00BUS3AKS|5|wife loves this.
B0011FLODA|5|I'm using this adapter on a Honda generator so I can connect the power cord to my RV.  High quality adapter and works as advertised.
B000X1Y642|2|color match was wrong
B001PNHBW6|5|Switch worked like advertise.. Click it one way to unit goes forward click it the other way it goes backwards. I am using it on a custom built mobility scooter to back the unit back up.. You have to flip the switch because it holds the position you put it in
B008G22NGI|5|Nicr
B0087NAZM0|5|We currently only use this product for communicating front seat, back seat and with another couple that ride with us. Setup was easy, and we have not had any problem with our communications. Battery life is Great even with near constant use over several hours one day.
B008HRZPXU|5|I like it. It will lossen over time but you just tighten the screws
B009DIX71E|4|This spacer gave me at least 200 horsepower to the wheels. At least thats what I tell everyone.
B004ZG8DAY|5|got my boots today and I couldn't be happier! they look great and fit as I expected(bought a half size larger than normal to accommodate good socks! and for extra air flow around my foot!)<br /><br />  the boots seem to be good quality and all parts work as they should! they came with extra toe sliders so when the current one wear out I can replace them. I am sure it will take a week or two to break them in , but that is to be expected. a nice touch is the elastic calf tighteners on the back which pull the calf plate in to fit your calf and make the boots fit better (for those who wrote reviews saying the calfs were &#34;too small&#34;, try letting them out with the button on the back and then adjusting to your calf size it should take care of your issues!)<br /><br />  in all I love these boots, they are just like the Sidi &#34;Vertigo&#34; boots, with 1/3 the price! and the parts are interchangeable! the only real difference is some of the parts that are red on these boots are black on the Sidi boots, who cares!?<br /><br /> the vents on the outside are close-able so if it rains you can stop water from getting in, but when it's hot out they can be opened to allow air to get in and cool your feet! sure some of the plastic parts may be cheep, and may break in the future, but I can buy 2 more pairs of these before I have spent the same money as the Sidi's and I am sure that the Sidi's are made with the same basic type of parts, so again I fell that I am way ahead of the game!<br /><br /> I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good street boot at a Great price! just keep in mind these boots are made for riding not walking, I carry a backpack with some shoes in it for those times I ride to somewhere I need to walk around at, this will save the thin soles of the boots and help them last much longer!
B000KL365K|5|This is a great quality part, fits perfect in my 02 WRX, and the wires are of a larger gauge which makes it easier to handle.  Awesome part for a great price!
B001HK5LWE|5|good
B00651CLCS|2|Nice look but bad reception!
B000C846NW|5|I have a friend that fell victim to a some a**holes who put sugar in his gas tank, so being that I have the same model vehicle (2004 Chevrolet Silverado), I decided to get one and it fits perfectly and locks my gas tank. Sure if someone was determined enough they could manage to get it off, but it gives me a little piece of mind and is a deterrent for kids who want to do this kind of thing, because it would be difficult to get it off. I'm giving it 5 stars, because it is just as advertised. I wish they did come with a tether like the OEM one, but it's a great product.
B00G9W9Q4Y|5|It just plainly works...
B007Y50HT8|5|Awesome fit to my car and blocks out the sun really good.<br /><br />This will be a good buy for anyone!
B000EDUUG2|4|We bought this for our camper and really like it.  It folds pretty small but is a full size broom which is nice because I'm tall.  The only thing I think could be better is the dust pan.  Ours is just slightly warped and doesn't lay as flat as I would like, but still works pretty good.  My parents and in-laws saw it and thought it was a great idea for their campers, too...so it made a good Christmas gift.
B0002MA03S|5|Yes these horns, and any other Hella Supertone horns you find \\"new\\" will be made in China. I was slightly worried when I first ordered because I did my research and knew this was the case. I ordered anyways because of the lack of reviews on other types of horns out there. I put these on the front of my Hyundai Elantra and completely removed the stock horn.    Keep in mind that the only thing that comes in the box is a pair of horns (high tone and low tone) and a relay. USE THE RELAY. You might think that the power going to the stock horn is sufficient but run a volt meter to it, when the horn is pressed, and chances are you are getting less than 12V. Just as you would think the extra power just creates a louder horn.    I got all of my supplies from Home Depot. A 36x1\\" bar of steel and 2 nuts and bolts. I cut this down and drilled two holes to mount my horns to because I didn't have room in the stock location. I also got a spool of red wire and a spool of black wire 14 gauge (a little oversized, you'd be fine with 16 or 18), some heat shrink, and connectors to plug into the horn, relay, and attach to the battery and grounding points. I took my time and made sure that all of my connections were crimped, soldered, and shrinked very well. I found a location by the battery for the relay and hooked everything up.    These horns sound great. With the dual tones alone more people will notice these but they are probably 50% louder than my stock horn. The quality looks fantastic. I would certainly order another set. Install took me ~2 hours including run time to home depot and I was taking my time.    Just Google search for the wiring diagram and ideas of how to mount them.  [...]
B000HZT89C|5|I really like this organizer. It gets my tissues, wipes and hand sanitizer off the floor and into a compact and handy package that I can reach from my drivers seat. Great product!
B001551K3U|1|I was looking for a \\"motorcycle\\" license plate frame and was sent this produce for a car. The license plate frame is very cheap and very flimsy. The only good outcome was that Amazon refunded my money.
B000TYQB14|5|GREAT
B005I7JAX8|5|A little slow on shipping but worth the wait good code reader
B000C45676|4|It seemed a little worn out on the outside but it works fine.
B001O0GHCA|5|Great product.  Used these for my new black rims and they fit perfect.
B006G14FK8|5|I used this to charge up two large (BMW) car batteries after my alternator died and I used a new-ish battery to drive my car home.  Worked like a champ.  I don't think I used all 8 stages because the batteries didn't require a recondition, but that is a good thing.  This is pretty fool proof and I like the two different attachment methods.  It's pretty compact too, probably about the size of a hot dog and bun.
B002S0C46S|5|I purchased this part for my car.  After taking it to the dealer to have it installed, I was informed it was not the correct part.  This company was great to deal with.  They emailed me a UPS return label and credit my card for the purchase price including shipping costs.  They were prompt and followed through with everything they promised.
B002IYJYV2|5|Thanks so much for the item, im so happy with it and hope to get more item later. appreciate it.
B000XTPO2M|5|I'm very happy with the quality and stability. The lock is easy to use and the key can be found easily in the dark because of the way it's made.
B000CIRR06|4|Easy to install Looks Great

B0073MG0DY|5|great value!!!  overall size was larger than expected!!
B007QV0R7W|5|Das Produkt ist wie beschrieben schnell angekommen.<br />Mit dem Gerät kann man wie im Viedeo zu sehen schnelle fehlersuchen durchführen oder etwas Messen oder Testen.<br />Ich habe mit dem Power Probe 1 schon früher zu tun gehabt und wollte immer so etwas haben.<br />Nachdem ich es hier für einen faieren Preis gesehen hatte habe ich es direkt bestellt und bin sehr zufrieden.<br />Anzeige ist gut ablesbar und die LED beleuchtung hilft auch in dunklen ecken gut weiter.<br />Die Kabelsätze sind lang genug um gut um ein Großes Auto oder mit velängerung auch an einen LKW zu kommen.<br />Einziger nachteil ich brauche eine Spannungsquelle also eine Batterie.<br />Konnte damit sehr schnell meine Tagfahrleuchten anschließen da ich sehr schnell zu messen war wo auf welchem pinn das Standlich geschaltet war.<br />Bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt !

B001TY0DTE|5|as advertised
B008G3HMU4|5|These are a near exact fit, amazing price, perfect clarity. I get high beamed when only my low beams are on they're this clear, I do not use high end bulbs in them either, no need too, they project light perfectly. No complaints, easy installation and work the same as higher priced options!
B003PA07DC|4|Not the right shade but couldn't find one to match my model interior. Very durable and tough but one side didn't fit tightly and there was nothing else I could do or try to get it flush. It's a tad wiggly on that side but overall just happy to have a pull strap again. I would recommend
B000BZJ7X0|3|Bosch has worked well for me in the past with Mercedes Benz cars and with a Volkswagen. I'm unhappy to report that it did not work well with my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2004.  I had to get an NGK for that car.  The low voltage signal coming out of these sensors is actually too low for the PCM and every so often, I get a P0137 error.
B001F115FW|5|Cleans hands thoroughly, and smells great.
B00I2ZUZLE|3|The pump woks good with no problems, but the mesh that came with it is a real pain to install, does not fit well, not a least on the TL1000S, I do not know about another models like TLR, V Strom, SV, but my recomendation to TL owners is if the old mesh looks ok used that one intead the new one, it will be a H----LL lot more easy to install I could not used my old one because it was not good.
B00068XCQU|5|You've seen all the other reviews, I won't be able to add anything that hasn't been said already about the great job this does topping off your batteries. Like others, I've been burned by the failing batteries of less used vehicles and got this to help the situation, after seeing how good it works I bought an additional unit. I was worried about how much current the units drew from the wall while idling as that could potentially drive up the cost and negate the benefits of maintaining your batteries so I conducted a little test.  My test has a group size of 1 so it doesn't take in to consideration larger or smaller battery sizes, but here are my results:    My motorcycle's stock battery is a yb18l-a and is rated at 270 cca @0 degrees.  Put the tender on last night and the tender drew 30 watts from the wall.  When it went to 80% it was down to 23 watts.  This morning it was fully charged and my meter was toggling between 2 and 3 watts.    What this means is that it draws about 1/2 the current of a 5 watt nightlight. Most of us use many times that amount leaving unattended wall-warts plugged in and any remote-control device draws at least that much to operate it's remote on/off circuit.   This tender won't add anything to your electric bill if you just unplug some other item that draws about the same. A simplistic approach, but we're talking about 2 to 3 watts.   I'm sure someone who's good with the whole amp/hours thing could figure out exactly how much it costs per month at that rate but I'm not gonna worry about it.  I bought an extra battery connector and the 25' extension cable which both had free shipping. I used to enjoy making these kinds of things but these have nice molded ends with rubber dust covers and you can't beat the free shipping so it's worth the money.
B0000BVFUU|5|Great, not like the plastic ones. very durable and easy to set up. I haven't tried it out yet in the water but I suspect its going to be great.
B006PAM19W|4|Works as advertised, will be kept in chain bag as a spare set of tighteners, should one break during install - cheap insurance because chains are useless without them and there is a lot of stress on the tighteners
B005DZ7JRY|3|Purchased for y Ducati S2R 1000 about a year ago. The product continues to work as it should but is no example of shining quality.<br /><br />The biggest issue that buyers can expect it that the bearings holding the &#34;pin&#34; that slides into the rear axle need to be press fit. While this is not a major issue for your typical gear head, it can create some problem to the casual motorcycle rider who does not do his own wrenching.<br /><br />So expect to fiddle with this when the package arrives as it is not fully assembled and ready to use.
B006GJLENQ|5|Very solid, very easy installation of you have the right equipment. would recommend.
B000C9Y1FE|4|It's a tranny filter what can you say?
B0015CIUXQ|5|A good quality muffler at an even better price. looked just like the factory muffler and install was a breese.
B000BNZPSI|5|it took  about 10 minutes to install after i saw the installation video.   [...]  everything lined up correctly to the bezel included.
B00MQAAZJI|5|Great frame
B005HOPELE|5|I love this product. It has met my expectations to the t. Everything works as advertised. I recommend this product. My car runs great!
B002DLYR8A|5|I purchased a couple sets of these goggles to convert to Steampunk goggles, and I am very satisfied with the quality and construction. I will be buying these goggles from this vendor in the future.
B0001L0DFA|5|I love this nozzle. I have a big yard and it spray very far.
B0068EPYP8|3|The cable is ok.  The connector that attaches to the SR10 is very cheaply made and does not made a very solid connection.  The coiled cable is very thin and you have to be very careful with it.  I assume it will have to be replaced sometime in the future.<br /><br />Other than that it works.<br /><br />The only cables that are made well are the USB Charging Cable but I assume they buy that from some company already made.<br /><br />Overall, I am not all that happy with the construction of any of the Sena products.  They are very cheaply made especially the Headset Speakers.  The sound is very tinny.
B00RV83UUG|4|It is what I spect
B00T71JJPA|5|Great product
B00CMEN89M|5|The factory hubcaps on my 2008 Chevy Malibu would not stay on.  Finally I lost one and could not find it.  I ordered these clip on hubcaps and I love them.  They are by far better that the factory hubcaps.  They are better quality, snap on easily, and also do not rattle (the factory hubcaps would rattle when I drove over bumps.)  My 15 year old son & I were able to install them in minutes.  We have driven my car up a mountain since installing the new hubcaps and they stayed on!  I am very happy with them.
B005FMF9DQ|1|Not worthy for the price and doesn't look good compared to the picture,receive item broken w/c means it easily breaks
B000E4BW7W|5|After standing ankle deep in icy slush, pushing 8 quarters in a gas station air pump to fill two tires, I went searching locally for something to check/pump-up my tires and found only incredibly slow cigarette lighter compressors. I wanted an electric inflator I could use in the garage and would do the job more quickly. The Bon-Aire does that. But more than that, it is a really neat piece of compact engineering, sturdy and easy to use(except the thumb lever for connection to the tire.)That is a struggle for these 75-year-old fingers. Probably a W-D 40 job. (The thumb lever, not my fingers!) The company sent it ASAP and the price was resonable, expecially for such a well constructed machine that does the job quickly with reasonable noise level.
B000DCN9BW|5|they do the job!
B00DJWGTDI|5|Working great, exact replacement for my neighbors daughter's scooter!
B000CSW7K6|3|fast delivered and look ok....I didn't expect this made from China, thanks
B002QEFM8S|5|Great Price  Just as advertised
B006JD4RVA|2|Installed this exhaust pretty easy, hard part was removing tape it was wrapped with. Showed up sooner than expected which was a plus, but was not exactly bent right. Could not adjust properly to keep from touching under side of vehicle and get noise when sitting idle, coming from just in front of right rear wheel. I don't expect to have this car much longer, 184,000 miles, so didn't get too upset. Still quieter than what I had.
B0042ZIT7U|5|Used the mat for the first time this weekend.  Very happy with it.
B00C7OVGTG|5|Install is straightforward and simple. EVERYTHING you need is included, from wire to tie straps, clamps to fuse. All you need are basic tools. To be street legal you have to use the included module and mount in a certain zone. The module connects inline with your lights so these use the appropriate brightness. - full or reduced.<br /><br />If you want to use these differently - say as lights for your truck bed or even as portable lights - you can just hook these lights up directly to a 12V source. You'll want a switch inline, but it's really simple! Even a 23A battery will power one of these for a few hours - blindingly bright!<br /><br />So these are versatile and easy to use and install. The light is a continuous tube - no visible individual bulbs. Really cool!
B004I10WDC|5|Works an looks great
B001NAQRFI|5|I installed this on my friends 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer. This bolt on upgrade was well worth the money. I immediate noticed a positive increase in horsepower, torque, throttle response and fuel economy. Easy to install and well worth the money.
B001R5ORBK|5|First shipment came in damaged, second shipment came in perfect, still holding up.
B006JETKIY|5|the price and function is correct, the bike respond very good, i recomend this product for your bike very thanks
B001JK1A4K|4|A neat item, however the lasers will dim over time, especially if they are activated often. love that scooby dooby doo.
B000C545MC|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B001HZQW0Y|4|I had found it impossible to locally find wrenches that didn't exceed 1/8\\" in thickness.  This set satisfied that need and turned out to be very rugged, at least for my purposes of installing bathroom shower door hardware.  My only disappointment was that they didn't come in the pouch in which they seem to be pictured - they just came loose in a priority mail envelope.
B00519T0GA|5|I bought this for the transponder chip. These keys put the transponder chip in a removable insert into the plastic part of the key. I bouth a 3 button flip key shell that doesnt include the transponder so this was a cheap way to get one. I put everything into the Key Remote and took it to my local locksmith who programmed it with no issues for $25. That means I got a flip key with remote and programmed for $50. Much cheaper than a plain old key  and remote from the dealer which will run you over $100.
B0046BLB3Y|3|I love the way it looks. The only issue was that after I secured it with the pieces that were provided it broke in a couple days and slides sometimes.
B00117DXQY|5|The best car shampoo on the market!
B00B3P26N0|5|Application was easy.  If you've never put on vehicle stickers before, you-tube it first.  It goes on the outside of glass and you should clean the surface really well first.  It has an application layer so you place it all at once, squeegee it down firmly with a plastic card/blade, then remove the application layer.  I read several poor reviews by people who are too stupid to figure out how to put a sticker on.  Good product.
B00G186POK|5|Work great fits fine.  Make sure ur housing is big enough
B007GMHTQ8|5|I love this roof basket however I ended up returning it.  Modifications were made in mounting it on the load bars of an '08 MINI Cooper but I felt unsafe so I ended up returning it.  It is very comparable to big name brands for half the price and if I could only adjust my load bars because it was too close to one another. Other than that, great product and would recommend it to anyone.  Just make sure that your load bars are more that 27 inches apart for the basket to do a safe and secure install.
B0007VXZ7W|3|When I received this device I was not able to use it at first until I loaded some additional information into it.  I would not be so disgusted with this fact had I received the right hook up to download the iformation into my brand new Dell computer. But the connector they sent to download was not compatible with any port on my computer, so I had to go to Staples in order to buy a $30 connector so that it would now plug into a USB port. Now I understand that technology keeps changing which is why you would or might have to dowload new information, but as long as I have using computers, USB ports have been the most available.
B00ELHNEJ2|5|It is Pennzoil. Pennzoil is named for the Pennsylvania crude that it is made from. It has always made the best lubrication oil. I get it just to be sure I am getting the good stuff.
B008YMXMW4|5|Great product and very well built, looks great. It fit my VLX shadow 600 perfectly but when I sold that bike and bought my 1100 shadow sabre it would not fit.
B000ZAMT2W|5|The seatcovers came pretty quickly. They fit like I ordered them special made for my Jeep, Liberty. They are a nice color and seem to be well made overall. All the holes for seatbelt and other things are where they should be which was very nice. Only the holes for the headrest were not sewed around the opening so there was a small snag where the material started to run. Once I put the headrest on you cannot see the tiny snag nor has the run grown. The seat covers were a bit of a challage to get the on due to the snug fit, but well worth the work. they fit so well =, no lumps- no sagging. I ordered covers for the front and back seats and both are great. Overall I am very pleased with this item
B007HH7A7A|5|After using my stock 2005 Envoy XUV antenna as a lock pick, I found myself in need of replacement. Turned out to be a blessing in disguise as this received FAR better reception than the stock antenna ever did.<br /><br />In addition, You'll really enjoy not having to remove the antenna during car washes. Just take some time with the installation as it's not the most straightforward design (but that's a person flaw, not a product flaw).
B0058SQO2C|4|It arrived fairly quick and undamaged, just what I needed.  Tight fit for the cover it replaced, but it worked.
B0006IX87S|5|Nice product
B00M1OUBES|5|The build quality of this device is top-knotch, it feels solid and durable and the rubber end caps protect the ports from water ingress. The lithium battery is *powerful*, it will start a dead car again and again and again on a single charge. Just like everything else about this unit, the crocodile clamps are chunky and solidly built unlike many other plastic clips on other similar units. This product is designed to last in a way that puts it far above all the similar compact lithium booster boxes I've seen. If you're in the market for this type of device this is the only one to get.
B004RNR9BY|5|After my traditional &#34;white&#34; RV hose bit the dust, I was looking for something more substantial - and this 5/8&#34; hose fits the bill.  Nice sturdy hose ends (not pot metal) and coild back up (more or less) when I'm done!  This hose gets my vote!
B008HIT3QO|5|Exactly what is says it is.  My apartment has a guest bathroom that leads directly into a bedroom and the door doesn't lock.  With my guests being &#34;inebriated&#34; often this is a gentle reminder to use the other door.  Works great
B0090NWZ60|5|My ole girl is a 1995 Honda. Aside from living in Florida where things to disintegrate quickly because the car seat, she's just plain old! When the Knob on my heater broke, I drove for about three years switching the one Knob over to regulate the other Knob.  I did price other replacements at Honda, but they were $25. Just for a joke I checked on Amazon, and there was this nice little Knob for $3.23.  All fixed! And it works great!
B009IMQT88|4|Don't work on my 93 Dodge truck. So I have no need for them. Ish I would have known sooner
B00EO0RN5M|5|it's pretty and it works.
B0002U268W|5|Awesome!!
B004FSQ8KO|4|I installed this on my motorcycle last year. I like that it has a sealed cover on it. The one thing that I have a problem with is the wires were to short to reach the battery. BUT thanks to a connector or two and a couple extra lengths of wire, we were able to make it work.
B000BO6MFC|1|This was a somewhat pricey leather conditioner compared to the alternatives. I bought a total of 3 different leather conditioners to try. A high-end, a middle-grade and the cheapest one (Armor All). They all turned out to work about the same. The Armor All is what I will probably continue buying when use up the other ones.<br /><br />The main issues with the Blue Magic product are:<br /><br />1. The spray nozzle only has one setting. On that setting the liquid does not get sprayed onto the surface but instead gets squirted out with force. This causes the liquid to bounce off the leather surface and splatter around, and you can see droplets on the floor, on the non-leather parts of the furniture, etc. It is a very poor bottle design in that sense.<br /><br />2. The liquid is not very dense. I expected a somewhat creamy liquid, but it is more like milk. Very watery, chalky in color. When it gets squirted onto the leather surface it runs down the surface and needs to be wiped in immediately. If you are applying it onto a horizontal surface, then the liquid wells up into the lower areas and makes these chalky mini-puddles. My concern is that since the liquid runs so much, it also seeps through the stitching and gets on the inside of the padding/cushion which is not a good thing for the furniture piece. I don't want to soak my chair and couch cushions with leather conditioner.<br /><br />3. It makes the leather color run slightly. Not much, and not enough to be a big concern about discoloring the furniture, but enough to be noticed on the white rubbing cloth.<br /><br />4. It never dries away completely after application. It has been 3 days since I treated a couple of leather chairs with this product, and they still feel a tad oily to the touch. I don't want them to feel oily. I prefer that the leather gets soft, but 100% dry.<br /><br />As far as leather treatment and maintenance products, this particular one is a total no-go for me. Generally, after experimenting in the last few days, I would never buy any conditioner which costs more than $5 per bottle. Any price above that is a scam. I think the pricing of leather conditioners varies so much because people pay a lot of money for their leather furniture and want to spend some on maintenance. The vendors take advantage of that fact and price the products from a few dollars to $30 and up.
B007AXRGUC|5|If you see it you know. Thats what makes me like this sticker so much. Some ask &#34;Whats .223&#34; others just jump into conversations about what mods they have.

B000CNGS56|5|Shipping came in less than two days even though it said a week, which was sweet justice. Already used it to pull my buddies f350 out of a mud hole down in Alabama, let me say this rope pulled out faster than a teenage boy trying not to have a kid. If I were King Kong`s dentist I would choose this as the dental floss of choice, this rope will not be breaking anytime soon.

B004I8M03K|5|They look good on the truck.  They were direct bolt on.  They are bright.  I am very happy with these lights and would recommend them.  Very good stock like look.
B00GJFUT6U|5|I bought these to replace the under-counter lights in the galley, and the aft head in our boat.  I was anxious to replace these 2 locations with LED's because the incans that we had in there were very hot.  With the heat of the icans, I was afraid the plastic dome covers over the fixtures would become brittle over time.  I replaced them with these LEDs and the difference in heat was noticeable.  Now, I keep the galley lights on more often and I can barely feel any heat when touching the dome covers.
B00418XZOU|4|I love my Goofy sticker!  He is such a lovable character and this layout of him is perfect (and a conversation piece.)  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that some of the smaller, detail sticker parts aren't wanting to sticker very well.  Again, they are the smaller, detail parts so it's not a major issue.  The time it took for the sticker to be delivered to me was quick and I have no complaints at all about the company or ordering process. I will remember this good experience next time I need another sticker!
B005HBBZEM|3|I bought this item and give it an initial 3 stars because it appears to be a very nice product. However I was greatly disappointed that there was no kind of instructions on how to connect the thing. For Christ sake it has five (50 wires). That in my view was very poor of the venders. No one wants to be stuck with a product they cant use which is were i am kind of at right now with this. Please can  simple  wiring instructions based on the colors of the pig tail be placed in the product discribsion.i.e which two color wires are the ones to connect to the shunt, and which is for voltage measurement.
B004GC4N1K|2|I ordered these OEM mirrors to replace my existing damaged originals. After mounting them securely and adjusting, I drove around to check my uninhibited viewing. While the view was perfect, the stability suffered. The mirrors vibrated uncontrollably. I rechecked my mounting bolts and found them still securely in place. Needless to say I'll be returning them ASAP.
B003CN30X6|5|Ok!!
B0006PXYGG|5|this kit was really easy to install. But the bolts that go on the bed of the truck are to short had to purchase longer ones. other then that easy install.
B009AA2FAY|5|Once I diagnosed the problem, this was located under the from driver bumper below the radiator cross member.  Quick to install be you must disconnect the battery terminals from the vehicle as not to deploy the airags should you make a mistake.  This item was about $50 but will be costly if the airbag releases.
B000C6KLVA|4|I purxhased this in 2013 and recently installed it on a Mazda 2 (1.25 litre similar to Ford Fiesta) 2003 and was impressed with the fit. Purolator make good quality oil filters. I have tried most brands and prefer both Purolator and Bosch oil filters, and Purolator have been around since their invention of oil filters many decades ago. Overall very happy with the L14612, I only gave it 4 stars because last year they cost $3.27, not they are $5, not much difference but a pity they couldnt keep their prices low for longer. Very happy that Purolator ship these internationally to New Zealand. Change at 6,000 miles (10,000km) though, if you want a longer service life get the PL14612 (Orange coloured Puolator oil filter).
B000C57ZPG|5|Great Product at a good price.
B000JFNAMQ|5|This product is very durable, perfect size, and very lightweight. I love it. Very simplistic and very reliable..Everything was nice and smooth.Thank You.
B00CZ89UVA|3|to small but looked like a nice helmet
B00O86TEMC|1|I bought this with high hopes since most car fragrances sold at stores don't last more than a week! Well, guess what, this spray doesn't last even half a minute! That's how weak and diluted it is. I've tried spraying my car's upholstery multiple times, even in the same spot with it, but it just doesn't leave a lasting smell which disappears within a minute. There goes my fantasy to come back to a nicely smelling car. I will see if I can send it back or get a refund. Im the first one to leave a review and hope it helps others.
B00MYI5DXA|5|Super bright LED's, I am very pleased and at a fraction of the price as some of the bigger named LED products on the market. Placed on the front bumper of my rzr in conjunction with the RC-20 inch single row LED light bar. What a remarkable difference.

B00869BBW8|3|I bought this to lubricate some brand new locks that will be out in the elements.  It seems to be intermittent as to how much Teflon comes out each time I spray.  When it runs out, I doubt I will buy more, I think the good ole graphite powder is still my preferred lock lubricant.
B000LN15GE|5|Good price,  saved money

B004IZ6YV2|4|This is a quality fuel door, at a very reasonable price. Although you do need to drill the rivets out on the old fuel door. This is why it gets four stars instead of five. Directions say no drill. Other than that it is a nice accent on my truck.
B002UZEC9I|5|Perfect fit in my 535xi, I will buy again. Also simple do it yourself change
B00G620ZVU|5|Great product for the price.
B001LHVOVK|5|i got this to evaluate the &#34;check engine&#34; light on my dash.  Found out I had a bad spark-plug wire.  It indicated which one was bad and I replaced it.  This is a must-have if you want to diagnose your own vehicle.  It saves you money and lets you know the problem so you can address it.  Just make sure it fits your vehicle.

B001G7W3GU|4|Seems to be as original.  But it's a dipstick.  I'm not in love with it.  I would recommend as a replacement if needed.
B0083D1SQQ|5|works
B00EAOIRDO|5|Easy to install and cheap.  Dealership wanted $65.00 to replace current filter.  Saved $50.00 of ripoff money.  It takes about one minute to replace it in my wife's Corvette.
B002D33QBW|5|These stickers are great. Pay attention to the size, they are bigger than they seem...in this case, we liked that they were larger.
B007EHOX7S|5|I was OK with my wife having an antenna that didn't go up and down.... She way not.  This was a perfect, inexpensive solution.  Just had to take the motor off, the cover off to clean out the broken strap, turn the radio off as it was fed and it worked great.  Still going strong.
B00AWYD7RC|5|very good
B004LLQNL4|1|I attempted to use this heated seat cushion while driving. I plugged it in after I had started my car and was driving, turned it on, and 2 minutes later (fortunately while I was in the parking lot for the supermarket) the car battery died. Prior to this I have not had any car trouble or battery issues.
B000COYKR8|4|I would have preferred lead weights. Because these weights are steel, which makes the weights longer than I would have preferred.
B0007LVD8K|3|I love the the convenience and saved time of not having to use a wrench to change out balls when I pull different trailers, but buying American is very important to me.  As the Curt class III reciever I purchased was made in the USA, I assumed the accessories would be also.  I would have purchased a different (American-made) brand had I known this was made in China.
B004SD1P4A|5|Just install this kit and it works very good . Recommend this kit for VW Golf 2003 ! Thank you
B00449VUE8|5|Though it may be unclear from the title,  this is a Toyota OEM part.  Fits perfect and equal quality to the original.
B001JT7AJA|3|These were returned but not because they weren't a good product they were just the wrong size. However they did charge a restocking fee and when all was said and done I think I recieved $1.00 back on my return.
B003V17NK0|1|tow rope broke on first use pulling a cavalier all of .5 mile poorly made I could understand if we were towing a truck or sizeable vehicle -JUNK!
B00EQ26FPW|5|They look great.  exceeded all my expectations.  They are on my 1996 328i and fit perfectly.
B004H7PE62|3|Is not exactly what I've expected, but the quality is good.<br />It would be nice to show more realistic photos in order to notice that is not a coin but a pin
B0086ZNCDS|5|FITS PADDED STEERING WHEELS VERY WELL , EASILY INSTALLED , WORKS GREAT AND WELL MADE......WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND EVEN THOUGH A LITTLE MORE PRICEY THAN SOME...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..LOOKS VERY NICE ALSO..
B00D2JZ4UW|5|It arrived today I installed it today and it worked flawlessly. Thank you for a great product.
B00VS0T7IC|5|Nice tire gauge, very well made with accurate measurements.

B004KEJVDO|5|Best spring compressor I've used and the price is great!  I haven't tried to use it inside the engine bay yet but the way it is designed you can use it from multiple angles, so I'm sure it can easily be used in fairly tight places.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!<br /><br />I was able to use it on a head that was completely off the engine as well,  I wasn't sure it I'd be able to but it wasn't hard.  However, this might be more difficult with higher spring pressure.
B006CUHUVY|1|You get what you pay for.Inferior product.<br /> It will cost just as much to return after paying shipping ,handling insurance and restocking fee.
B005DKIIJW|1|This is a prime example of a good idea poorly executed. The charger has great features and a comes with plugs to fit many carts. Unfortunately the quality of the charger is low. The LED display lit up of 10 seconds the first time that I plugged it in, than nothing after that......<br />Amazon initially refused to accept this charger on return. It is listed as &#34;hazardous&#34; material. After numerous emails Amazon agreed to refund my money. Very disappointing.
B003SYFD2A|5|everything was there and it had a bulb it was good to go
B00GXI34GK|5|easy to install. work good. looks nice and bright. compare to the other brand its less expensive. great quality .
B000IZ2B6S|5|Nice
B001EYYPUM|5|I'm buying these every year now,  worth every penny.  and not too many pennies either to be honest
B00IMVK08G|5|I have mostly used the gray visor but have found that it not only protects your eyes from strain, but when driving into the sun it also helps to keep your body cool. Areas of my shirt that were not protected by the sun shield were noticeably warmer than the part in the shade of the visor. It fits nicely on my '08 Ford Explorer. Much better than just using sunglasses and if needed you can still use your sunglasses for additional sun and glare protection. I can put my car visor down and extend this visor below it for additional sun protection.
B000M61VE6|4|Very good value for the money spent.  Manufactured well and has the feel of a much higher priced tool.
B00DDZWAZW|5|My wife started having issues with her iPhone5 battery running down very quickly and when it got to about 30% it would shut off.  I ordered this particular replacement (1) because it was backed by Amazon and (2) it was covered under the PRIME membership.  I received the part very quickly.  It took about 10 minutes to complete the battery swap on the phone.  After I replaced the battery and charged the phone fully in about an hour or so.  The phone is now holding a charge all day and is not shutting off at 30ish%.  We actually ran the phone down to 9% and it was still going strong.  I would recommend this replacement is you are having battery issues with an iPhone5.  Also wanted to mention, the tooling that was included with the battery is cheaply made, but I did not have any issues using it to perform the replacement.  The tools did work well for the replacement.  So, thanks, this 21.00 battery and tooling probably saved me from buying a new phone.
B0002Z2MZ4|5|Really does a great job!!!
B00M3NEBMK|4|Help protect my face and nose from the heavy winter whenever I walk my dog. It came with two, gave one to my father in-law. My husband and I share one. It fits really well doesn't matter what size you are. Planning to buy one more.
B00QR6ETLC|5|Great product looking forward to future orders
B00480N05A|5|correct part for a Reatta!
B003T1IS1K|4|Cover looks great in my S-10! Only complaint is you have to cut holes for seat belts.but this is the only cover I have found that fits my seat like it should. And in exactly the color I wanted.
B001O0ZLWC|3|i bought these to try to fix squealing on my nissan murano but after a few weeks the squealing is back
B000C6OL2K|5|VERY GOOD STOCK..THANK AMAZONE
B00IXDN0Y4|5|Seems really well built and very brite! Haven't used them long so I'm not sure how long they will last. Happy with them so far.
B000CN940W|5|Quality that you expect from Energy Suspension, 'nuff said.
B00B505GSU|5|Pleased with my order, item came as advertised and was exactly what I was looking for. Would buy this product again.
B007VRD0D4|1|Awful. I purchased these with the seat and seat cover for my stationary SIM chassis. After I mounted everything and sat down in the seat they immediately flexed and bent, which I had hoped they wouldn't when I opened the package and looked them over, because the metal is VERY light gauge steel. This was installed on a stationary chassis, just think what would happen if mounted to a real race car or simple street car.... I have experience in building both. Do not buy this product. Take the time to fabricate a proper stronger mount Shame on you JEGS.
B00MB0E1WK|5|So vibrant and colorful it gives my car some character and a touch of me
B004LF6RSY|5|Had to order after I got the water heater because who knew the water heater doesn't come with a door!
B000E8T81U|5|Quality engine oil filter with a grip on the shell that makes it easier to remove. The quality of the filter appears to be higher quality than OEM.
B000BVD0BY|1|Does not hold any dirt. Mats are smooth and flat so the dirt simply slides right off onto your carpet! Cute mats, wish they were made like the others with raised areas and soft rubber.
B001HZIF04|5|Great
B003SZ969U|5|Absolute perfect fit.  I put this on a 2005 Kia Sedona and it took about an hour.  If you have any mechanical ability whatsoever, this is a do it yourself job.  All you need is a phillips screwdriver and a 10 mm socket.  There are 4 screws holding the door cover on and 6 10 mm bolts holding it into the door.  Go to youtube and watch the video of the guy replacing the glass in a Sedona door, it will more than get you through this.  Good luck and save a lot of cash!
B00F9G8G60|5|I needed a ramp for my mother during her rehab. When I priced out materials and time to build what, I hope is a temporary ramp this was very competitive. Plus, I can use it to move appliances and other weighty items.
B002R0LPOG|5|i was  very satisfied it fit right on my 1997 toyota t100 i had no problems with the installation on it
B000CNH1EI|5|this set is a must.then use the correct head gaskets you need for your heads.suggest the edelbrock 7310 gaskets they work with cast or aluminum heads and are felpro gaskets at a much cheaper price.
B0087NB5TW|1|It did plug in on my 15  HD RGS but when attached to the sena sm10 it did not allow me to use the bike comms system as advertised.  Not happy!  The product looked to be of ok quality, I just could not make it work.
B000CB05RK|5|Very happy with this item. I was not sure if it would fit as I have screw terminals, but I needed a new cap as well so I purchased the set before I purchased the cap.<br />The description does state that this wire set comes with an accessory pack, enabling it to be used on either the push-on or screw-on caps, using your old terminal nuts. I did not use resistor plugs with this set and it functions perfectly. An excellent, quality item that I highly recommend.
B00877SL2M|5|I have ordered so many LED light and Cree bulbs, but this one here has made the word white a perfect name. For the price you can not get anything with such brightness. It makes my Terrain when I open the doors like spotlight at a main entrance.
B004JBYXP4|5|heavy weight filter with all the premium internals to make me content with this over the factory one.  Thanks MAHLE!
B0023080RU|5|good item
B001GS0DJ8|5|These window visors slid in perfectly, no double sided tape needed, just slide in and they stay put like a champ
B005KVLX50|4|I bought this to haul my canoe in the bed of my pick-up, which also has a tool box on it.  It arrived withoin the time period promised and was easy to adjust to the desired height and spread.  I used rachet straps to hold the canoe in securely.  With Shipping, it was still cheaper than making an in-store purchase where I bought the canoe and a similar store.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the height adjustment is limited.  Regardless, it meets the need for which it was purchased.
B005O2WIA4|5|This distributer,and it's 65,000 volt coil has made my Corvette's 358 engine, very responsive,and gave it quicker ramp speed.
B000P17NXQ|5|Why not buy the best, right? Think about it. It's not only about your safety, it's about the safety of everyone around you too. Don't skimp out!
B006TXCCE4|4|These seat covers were everything I was looking for. Very good quality, for a good price. They look great on my seats.
B007ZHU5QA|4|I have a 1/10 Traxxas and the wires would be hanging down pretty far and even one of them melted on my ESC (Electronic Speed Control) because there was so much slack. but other than that... they are very nice and pretty bright and i also like all the extra wires and conections....
B0068FYB24|5|They work great, sound is off the charts cranks the music even at high speeds. Will recommend to others looking to buy
B00252BWOY|5|worked perfect
B0040A4GA6|5|I love the soft and warmth of the steering wheel cover. I was happy to find the color which is hard to find where I live. The day I got it and it was put on right away. It is also cool when it is warm.
B000CIZV8Q|5|works very well for the application that I have for it. For the price you can't beat it. worth it
B000KHUDCI|5|Very well built, fits nicely in the hand and feels solid.  Should hold up to years of use and does work well.
B006VYHQWY|4|Perfect fit but missing parts and the exact parts are not easy to find. Luckily I wasn't missing the clips otherwise it would've been expensive. The dealer in Canada wanted 150.00 for the hardware and it comes in a package that cannot be broken down. I had all the clips but when I opened up the box, the bag that holds the hardware was ripped and some of the bolts were missing as well as all the washers. Washers were no problem but finding a torx head with coarse metric thread wasn't as easy. I finally found a hex head with the right thread at an auto parts store and luckily there was enough room around the hex head that I could use a socket. The head of the bolt is inset into the bar so I had to make sure I had enough room to get the socket in.<br />After going to three hardware stores and purchasing the right bolts, it worked and it looks good.
B0067ECOCU|5|good oil presure
B001OQT0U0|5|Great fit, looks great.
B009XR48MM|4|It works, but can quickly become expensive and time consuming.<br /><br />For this to work, you need to remove the door panels, carpet, or whatever is between you and the chassis of the car or truck. Want to reduce noise coming from the firewall? Remove the carpet or panels, then lie on your back under the dash for a few hours while you carefully cut and place the mat. This box (for $15) is just under 20&#34; x 20&#34;, so it could cost you $50 or $60 to cover the firewall, or a door.<br /><br />So yeah, it works. It's also time consuming, and quickly gets expensive.
B000O1C47M|5|Robinair is a top of the line product. From the little time I used this, it seemed to really do the job. I'll know more after using it, but from the start I'm sure it will give me the same service my old one has and still does. This would be a great buy!
B00I0H0QUO|5|The led bulbs give the inside of my car a bright green that i was going for... the color matches the picture SPOT ON! Super simple install no real battle with the install and the bulbs have not burned out on me I have had the bulbs for about 3 months now.  I will buy the led bulbs from this company the next time I need them.<br /><br />I recommend this product to friends.
B00BITKKFM|4|a bit flimsy but gets the job done.
B001P2DI1U|5|I'm installing an all new wiring harness in my car and wrapping everything in Painless' powerbraid loom. These things make the job 5 times as easy. Trying to feed the wire through and/or separate the loom with my fingers is cumbersome and these tools take all that pain out of the process.
B00AU4F74K|5|this rear view camera works great the images are very clear i installed it in my Renault Logan Dinamique 2009
B003UM7B98|5|Very good jack
B0009ZEVMO|5|Shipment arrived on time. The item was in easy to remove packaging (lightweight cardboard box) with installation instructions printed on the box. Took a total of 5 minutes from when you open the hood.
B000C59Y8M|5|Quality parts
B0068C7066|1|This windshield melted my ignition switch on my CTX700ND. Do not buy this if you do not want to damage your bike.
B001UEBXNS|3|The sensor is compatible with a 2003 Jetta.  It is a little bit bigger than the OEM part and I had an issue placing the c-clip back on. What I mean by bigger - the diameter of where the O Ring is placed is just a few mm wider. I went ahead and got the OEM part from VW.  I am not giving it a bad review just average since I know it would work on my 03 Jetta, but it will be difficult to get the c-clip on to hold it in place.
B001P29O5Y|5|Very nice bike rack, very well made and sturdy!
B004C6OBBC|5|good quality, sturdy and secure, worked perfectly with the hitch cover I ordered
B0033MEHEC|4|A bit tricky to attach but once it is on it is solid.  I like that it has a way to padlock the jack.
B000CCFYIE|5|the best price I could find on something that should cost a lot less being its only plastic and stamped
B00F66XA4G|5|Bought kit for 2006 HHR, everything fit and i havnt had any problems, packaging was good.
B00I96ENH8|4|So far, so good.  Fits, seems to work well so far.
B00SNMXFW2|5|These keys ALL work great with my ski rack.  I'm very happy I got them.
B0000WODVU|5|This is a great little tool.  Very accurate, and durable.  It works even when the temp is below zero.  If you have a long valve stem, you will need two hands (one to hold the stem, and one for the gage), but I need two hands for my other gages also, so no big deal.  I have other digital gages, but this one is the best.
B00DZIB9GS|4|This will not eliminate scrubbing on abused wheels but if you routinely clean your vehicle's it can be a lot *less* scrubbing with this wheel cleaner.
B000C7ZABA|5|excellent. i replaced mine after my engine light came on and now, i have no more engine light. light be gone.
B005WWO7YQ|5|So far I've put this in both of my cars with little to no difference that I could tell, but they both ran great to begin with. When I put it in my motorcycle (VTX1800), I could actually tell when the archoil hit the engine. The bike smoothed out, picked up some power, and ran like it was brand new out of the crate…just without the break in period. The biggest difference for notability occurred in my lawnmower, weed trimmer, and electric generator. The generator has always been load and very rough even with less than six hours on the engine. A quick addition of archoil and the engine immediately went quieter, smoother, and appeared to be a different engine entirely- for the better!! I will alway keep this product on hand for my engines. You only have to use such a small amount, this bottle will last for a long time. Get a syringe from the pharmacy to help measure smaller amounts.
B0019I64F2|5|Works great. Quick Delivery
B003U8KB08|1|The screw caps didn't fit and it had screws missing. Not a good buy very disappointed. Bla bla bla why do i have to write more
B00802GIW4|5|Works great
B0001EFSUC|5|The only part of this I use is the miniature pliers.  They are perfect for removing tiny pieces of wire from bicycle tires.  Shredded radial tire carcasses which people drive on until they disintegrate leave a lot of small bits of steel wire on the roads.  Bike tires pick these up causing slow flats.  To find these bits of wire, you have to run your fingers around the inside of the tire until you &#34;feel&#34; where the wire is, then pull the wire out.  Fingernails don't work very well for this purpose, the rubber grips the embedded wire pretty tightly, but these tiny pliers have very nice flat jaws that come together tightly without gaps at the edge, making them perfect for pinching down on these tiny wires and pulling them out of the tire tread.  These pliers are very small, light weight, rustproof, perfect for carrying on a bike, and VERY well made and polished, looking like they would be much more expensive than they are priced.  Every bike rider I have recommended them to has been satisfied with them and had similar good experiences using them to fix flat tires.  Recommended.
B00AZPI0NE|5|This is my first experiance with LED lights and I could not be happier. I mounted 1 on my back bumper as an aux backup light and wow is it bright. Highly recomended.
B00L3FAVA0|1|Adhesive did not work like it should. The decal started to peel after a day.
B00FXLJ8U4|5|well made emergency hammer. Nothing fancy but I'm sure would get the job done. I feel the mounting bracket is a must. Keeping it in the glove box or under the seat isnt a good option. It needs to be permanently mounted where you can reach it instantly under any circumstances; in total darkness, upside down, under water. And not mentioned anywhere, but I'm surely not the first to think: this would make a good emergency weapon if needed. Road rage exists. I wouldn't want to get hit in the face with that hammer, hopefully the bad guy won't either.
B0058OTGAS|5|Great
B000GUYLUE|5|Worked like a champ
B004MGKJ1I|5|Received my decal on time. Was exactly as described and what I wanted. Would recommend to others and order more if need to. Thanks
B001S21LJ8|5|The quality of this product is great.  Visually cleans up the engine compartment.  Coupled with a K&N filter element in the stock air box you transform your air intake into a performance system at a fraction of the cost you'd spend for a complete CAI.
B00CU7OPRU|5|worked great saved $$$
B006RO0YS6|5|The Led bulbs are very bright,I even got other drivers flashing me thinking that I had my high beams on LOL. The insulation was easy except the bulbs had some sealer on them causing them to fit snug in the housing. I didn't make any modification but I did remove one lamp because I couldn't understand what the problem was. All in all they look great and are very white and not yellow anymore. There were no warning lights on the dash saying there were bulbs out so that's a big plus. I will see how long they last and update my review if there are any problems.
B00NNGJHI4|5|So much better easy install.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with my Motorola RAZR HD....captures so much information I don't even know where to start :)
B000C7YAD4|5|on my Buick Park Avenue 1988yy installed 3 male pin CKP sensor,but Amazon send me 4 pin sensor!??????
B002AKFA94|3|The light never comes on when it is supposed to, indicating you have made contact. The slightest touch has it all out of balance. POOR!! Would not recommend to anyone!
B005CD4MQS|5|Smiley faces Arrived promptly, they look cute on our van and crossover car, and seems to be holding its color well!
B0016H2MFW|5|This product was recommended to me by a friend, and I love it.  Most all liquid waxes are easy to apply, but the true test is in how easy they are to buff off.  This came off with very little effort just using a microfiber cloth and arm power.  The finish and feel are silky smooth.  I am sold.  My friend says that the wax's protection will last for a year, and he is no slouch, so I'm going to see how it goes.
B00J901ZPQ|4|As other reviewers have stated these lights are not any brighter then the ones you are taking out. They are made to give your truck a different look. Do not buy this product and expect a brighter bulb. I have had these bulbs in for a few months now and they work fine. They were very easy to put install. I like the look of the cool white bulbs. Will recommended.
B00755JMYS|5|Work great. Installed them in my travel trailer to draw less power and have a whiter light. Love them
B002P8D5E8|5|Great product!  Perfect fit easy to install in about 10 minutes.  Looks great at a great price. Glad I bought new not used!<br />I would deffinately recommend this product.
B003CWBCZ0|1|This car cover does not fit the SL600 V12 Roadster as it says. The mirror pockets are off center by 16&#34; side to side and 8&#34; front to rear of vehicle.
B009P7M6UQ|1|The sensor they sent me looked fine, but the part where it connects to the hose is wrong.  My hose ended up popping right off that nozzle and leaking washer fluid all over my garage.  I thought it was my fault with the installation, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't even get the clip on the hose to &#34;snap&#34; over the nozzle like it does on the OEM one.  I compared it with my old OEM pump (made by VDO) and the nozzles had different designs.  The OEM ones were designed so that the hose would snap over the nozzle and keep it in place so that it doesn't pop off.  With this pump, you can't even snap the hose over their nozzle design.  I tried trimming it because I thought it was too big, but that didn't do anything.  I guess you get what you paid for, but the picture they have is misleading because it doesn't match what was sent.  When I compared my OEM pump to the one pictured, they have the same nozzle, but what they sent me was not the same. Very disappointed in this.
B0002SA21W|5|Bestop 51209-01 Black Windshield Channel for a '95 Jeep Wrangler. This channel makes it easy to install a Bikini Top on a Jeep Wrangler. It does not take long to install the channel and Top, Just follow the instructions.<br />Thank you - Carl Thornton ~ Hightogy, Alabama
B0031I2006|4|I agree with the other reviews which state this is a decent product considering the price.  No, it's not waterproof but keeps the majority of the rain/snow off and will also allow the air to circulate/breath.  Quite happy with the construction/materials for the price.<br /><br />A note on sizing which seems a bit lacking in the reviews/description:  The Medium is too small to properly fit my 1990 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6.  It covers enough to keep the rain off, but I can not see this properly fitting any sport bike in the 500cc+ range.
B008ZOZFQW|5|Very cool accessory!
B0000AY69V|5|Great product.
B003ZZK304|5|I think it looks great on my big white American car.
B00RV83UUG|5|Hardcore. Tough as nails. Will rip limbs off trees. Great lamp output. ATV and boat must have 4 night use. Great price. worth it.
B003NBFMMY|5|Very good product. Used for ski trip to Colorado. Very thick material, water proof and dust proof. Good zipper and fasten downs to tie it to your hitch basket.
B007TD1WIK|5|have not needed to use them yet. bought for my sons new car, so he will have them if he needs them.
B003UT1V38|5|Happy with how the item was packaged and product is working very well.  No complaints here except that you need to make sure you don't drive right away after application because it leaves black residue on the side doors.  I am not sure how long to let it sit yet before driving the vehicle to avoid those black splatter on the car's side doors.
B006WQ7IT2|5|At first I had to play with the wires a bit but as soon as you get them in and working its Perfect.
B003L9K9HQ|5|Bought it for my bicycles but find many uses for it sans bedroom. A little goes a long way and seems to stay put fairly well.
B000C9Q2UG|5|original
B0033BXWQC|5|Nice Porsche  authorized sign.
B006YCE1KS|5|Replacement on the interior lights are a breeze, was able to do it in about 10 minutes. Light for the trunk is a little bit dimmer than I'd want it to be but still works better than stock.
B00FA9OMGY|5|Very easy to install and remove, and along with the windshield sunshade, they really help keep the car cool.
B003KLTSAY|1|Was disappointed at the size of these stickers for what they cost.  It was probably my fault that I didn't look at them at them more closely.
B006KTK3U2|4|Fit well on wheels and best price found for item. Downfall was the caps are plastic. I guess that's the way they are made now. Think that was a tad expensive for plastic. But they look good and stay on!
B000E2AML6|5|I bought this for a 1997 Kawasaki ninja zx-11 w 31xxx miles I had recently purchased. I knew I need to do a couple routine maintainance things seeing given the miles on the vehicle. Howeve, when I tore into it it already had an older k&n filter on it. There was a difference in the designs given the current filter had a greater filter surface area compared to the one currently on the bike.<br /><br />Everything arrived in perfect condition and arrived quickly
B00DW4MB5S|4|I love these goggles! They keep the dirt out and look great the only reason for 4 stars is because I do sweat and they can fog up and are perty flexable meaning they are perty cheap but they are cheap so I am very pleased with them!
B001G3MAZS|1|Although two out of the three bushing properly fit my Tundra Truck, one was not even close. The drivers side steering rack bushing was about 10 mm thinner than the original. Both the amazon and the product write up were misleading. I put all the proper specs in for my vehicle only to take it to the mechanic to find out that only two bushing were useful. I now have a third bushing that is of no use to myself. I bought the most expensive bushing kit thinking that I was making the best choice....that was far from true. Do not trust the information about this product and don't bother buying it unless you have a Tacoma or Hilux.
B00JNODBHS|5|Great price, fast shipment!
B00636BNUQ|4|It looks nice and it works as intended
B00698FFKW|5|I love it,very easy to install on my 5 year olds, yamaha raptor 90 and does what it says...i will remember works connection and trust this name.
B000CMHVJO|5|We previously had a \\"shock absorber\\" type tailgate damper.  It was fine until it broke 3 months after purchase.  We bought this and like it better because it also assists in lifting the heavy tailgate of the pickup.  Installation was not difficult (our son did it easily) and it works great.
B00C7YDF0O|4|It has a very nice color to it, and it does light up the road just fine. However, when I was driving around I could tell that the power of the light was not very strong. If it were a foggy day driving through rainy mountains and such it would probably be a disaster. If you actually care about seeing the road I would probably try a lesser power. I'm probably going to try something around 4500k or possibly 5000k
B00APOAYSE|5|This license plate is very well made.  Well worth the money.  It is a lot more shiny than it looks in the picture and I can't see any<br />way that it would ever rust or break in any way.  You can tell that it is made of high quality metal.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.
B00JD96XDM|5|This is so beautiful! Looks great on my laptop!!!!
B000EW0KHW|5|I used to to pull codes for my 1990 f250 transmission. I could have pulled codes manual but, that is too error prone. This works great and is cheap.<br /><br />A tip with the diesel since the throttle needs to be fully depressed before and during the test. Stick a thick block of wood under the brake pedal and on top of the gas pedal. Otherwise invest in the extension cable for sale on here.<br /><br />On a side note the early e4od transmission with a diesel engine will not blink the overdrive light when it has codes stored.<br /><br />Ended up having a bad transmission oil temperature sensor, torque converter slip code, and tps out of adjustment.
B007TS6GEA|3|I did read the dimensions on the listing, but this still seems really small. I was hoping for larger trash can.
B004AXESTM|5|Lights look amazing on my G35 coupe. Brand new car look.
B002WKK8DA|1|Was ineffective in removing stains from the side of the pool  Had no effect on rust stains.<br />Was a bust.
B000ROJKI2|5|Direct fit.
B004T3KH2A|5|I've bought two of these and they work great.  The airline (Delta) had no problem with it and it was much easier than asking for an extender.
B000I66JEM|1|I have had this product for about three years. It has worked well until now. Recently, This product is not water resistant so I recommend making it a habit to clean and wipe down the inside to prevent the formation of rust; especially during the wet season. The reason I gave it a one star is that it can be opened with brute force. I was backing into a parking space, and there was a log for a back stop. The bottom the Hitchsafe came in contact with the log while backing down and the front of the Hitchsafe came right off exposing the contents inside. My assumption is that a person with a sledge hammer or other force could break in quite easily. The metal is not steel or any hardened metal but looks like a cheap material.  Never the less, I can't recommend this product or will buy again. Going to stick with AAA when the keys get locked in the truck.
B006VXNGVK|1|This item did not fit.  It was wayyyyyy tooo small  and it was soooooooo ugly.  This was taken care of.  I sent back and was refunded.  Thanks!
B002FOAZSG|1|WE SPENT OVER AN HOUR TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK. IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL !!!  A PIECE OF JUNK.
B000OCDYWK|5|OK
B001DH82QI|4|I had absolutely no problem installing this Dorman steering knuckle so I have to say it is a well made item.  As I stated in my review of AC Delco rotors, I wish Amazon would list Country of Origin in the Product Specifications.  Not sure but I assume this item to be Chinese made.  Whether it is or isn't, the quality seems to be good.  Especially at this price, which was much cheaper than the local chain-store auto places wanted for the exact same item.  I would recommend it.
B00063X38M|5|Great stuff.  Does exactly what it says and does it well.  Since it is to be applied to both surfaces to be bonded, you may need a helper to keep the weatherstrip in place after the adhesive has been applied.
B0015PK3AG|5|Works as described!
B00HS5W8XM|5|For $206, I replaced the my brakes and rotors!  They have not rusted, and have given my 2004 Expedition a great look and better stopping power!  I have had them on for several months now, and they have yet to show rust!!!!!
B0010ADJIE|5|only the best
B001A1M2YA|3|But after installing I notice that it was kinda flimsy and when I drove down the road it was hard to see out of it was just vibrating all over .  Looks nice but I'm ordering an original . I quests you get what you pay for .
B00DRGASCO|5|Awesome stuff.  Gives brilliant gloss to my trucks finish. Removes water spots and leaves a slick finish which keeps dust to a minimum. Easy to apply too
B004XRI3JG|5|Key chain looks great and was everything  I was expecting.  I recommend it to anyone wanting  a keychain with a BMW logo on it.
B009K7CXX6|3|I was disappointed to find out that the actual Pony is made of plastic. Looks OK. The chain and the ring are metal though.
B008E7R1EE|5|I had the repair shop replace the coolant level sensor in my 97 Chevy Venture two times previously with no resolution to my intermittent low coolant light.  Since I decide to replace the thermostat and radiator, I figured that I would be stingy and replace it also.  Everything went relative well considering the difficulty of replacing the thermostat,  the sensor replacement is actually quite easy when the radiator is out and not much to get wrong.  At first it looked like a success, but alas after a while of running I was back to getting the low coolant light.  Opening the radiator cap, revealed a full radiator and reservoir dumping fluid in to make up for any shortage.  My last resort was to have the whole system flushed which seems to have removed any trapped air.  So far, so good.  If you do it yourself on this type of engine, watch some of the youtube videos on &#34;burping&#34; your coolant system.  I think that at rest what looks like a full radiator, generates air voids around the sensor randomly when running.  Just guessing but it is worth a try.
B004MS9VTW|5|I received this item pretty fast (3 days). The price was good, others I have seen are are $20-70 more. I used this to change out my 530 chain. I did grind the head off first. Everything worked good, I took it slow, read the instructions. Broke chain, put side plate on, and pressed rivets. Nothing broke, everything has held together.
B000C6ZYIA|2|Imagine my delight to find a Raybestos master cylinder for my poor Town Car. The box arrived and was Red, White and blue like our once proud flag. Now to my disgust I look to the side of the box and on the decal are the words &#34;Made in China&#34;. This type of deception truly disgusts me. Plastering a box with the national colors should not be permitted when shilling parts made by communists.
B005FWWUNS|2|Overall, this is a really nice unit, but it has a major weakness. It's battery! It uses a button cell battery, it freezes and is pretty much useless under 20 degrees. Keep this in mind.
B00OSZBTXU|1|would not work with my CRZ 2011
B007UTPUDQ|5|Bought the 8&#34; because the 6&#34; was more expensive...go figure. Very solid, literally and figuratively, and I wanted the higher rating 10K trailer, 1500# tongue. Weighs only 16# and that includes the locking hitch pin (note this is matched to the lock that adjusts ball height).<br /><br />This is an accessory for me as I don't tow on a regular basis. Just wanted something that would allow me to borrow a friends trailer, get the odd equipment from the tool rental shop, etc. Lightwieght was a bonus for such a strong unit.
B00B36C0OY|5|Best tire shine I've used ever. After applying don't drive your right away. Let your tires dry completely. Watch your over spray on the wheels. You might have to clean your wheels again to remove this. If you don't the brake dust will stick to the wheels leaving a heavy dirty film that's hard to remove.
B0063E8TP0|5|Worked great on my 2006 Volvo S40
B009WVTOLY|5|Very fast shipping. Item exactly as described.
B000GRS2GG|5|Just like a portable garage
B00FGEUS2K|5|Lets the goat pokers know exactly where you stand.
B00N9SL0MM|5|I love these as washcloths for washing my face. They are very soft!
B008SEBQ2G|2|Nice looking antenna but lost 90% of reception
B000RN4FK6|5|they fit my 2009 Ninja 250R, lot of room, better then what i thought they would be,  i wish they had was scratch guards for the bike paint job. it do's set up against the turn signal, but that not a proplem eather.  well made, and so far it keep it form.
B001IH8Q0A|5|fits great
B00335JJKG|3|To start off, i have a 2004 Ford F150 Supercrew.<br /><br />I have the same brand of floor mats for the front seat, and those fit perfectly. These however, are not designed for a supercrew Ford F150, even though Amazon's &#34;Vehicle Fit&#34; says that they are.
B002P33KVQ|5|inexpensive, works like I need it to.  should be sold with a filter.
B000CGVQQY|1|Warped prematurely as per the other reports.  Do not recommend these for purchase.
B001NYTF6W|5|Perfect fit; fast delivery
B00DDQ194Y|4|Like how they fit with no problem
B001P5TDM0|5|Does  NOT last.  Plan to use over and over
B00TZ5Y67O|4|Nice cheap and easy to install.  I'd buy them again.
B004A0UAII|4|The title for this item needs to be clarified. This is the air filter for the engine. I was looking for the Cabin Air Filter. Still hanging on to the filter for when my engine air filter needs to be replaced.
B002YORJTK|1|I've had 4 of the 3000 series jumper boxes for personal use and business, had them for over 3 years, and they worked great.  I've purchases 2 in last year and both had issues. Circuit board won’t work and doesn't allow the charging system to charge the battery, bad light switches.  I'm guessing they have changes suppliers for some of these internal components and have cheapened a once heavy duty reliable tool. I have made several attempts to contact Quick Cable and never received any type of communication back.  I would highly recommend purchasing a different brand, you will be much happier. Plus my local seller has chosen to remove them from their shelves due to the problems.
B00CBWXX68|1|Don't waste your money, lights stay on, go to dealer for this part.
B00L84336U|5|I love the fog light it looks good on my avalanche
B007I6F57W|4|I got them on time. They do look diff. in person but i guess thats my fault. i guess i  interpreted the picture wrong. They are still cute..But you can tell they didn't cost a lot of money. Also they are a little big for my 2007 dodge caliber but thats no big deal. If you are looking for something cheap with a little style i would recommend them. You get what you pay for:) Also be careful taking out the staples that hold them together... i had my husband do it lol and you can tell they were in there.
B000FPXSYK|5|Probably a great place and I am sure it is a good product but it did not fit my truck and then I got stuck with it because my truck was in the shop for repair and so i went over the time limit for a return by when we realized it will not work
B0073J96XI|3|This was a universal part. Didn't quite fit my CB750 system without a few home modification (cutting plastic on the relay housing).<br /><br />but it worked!
B009M4COVI|5|Works great, just as advertised, was able to install my seals in a snap.
B00J54Q6MI|5|Night and day! I had the Banks auto tune before (thought it was a good product before I pluged this in.) Be prepared to call SCT for set up help it's a very high tech device that requires some sort of technical knowledge.  If you are a 60 year old man with a flip phone still this is not the device for you. The performance is excellent and fuel milage increase as well 2-3 mi per gallon.  Can't beat the 5 custom tunes. Just being able to blow coal all over the Prius next to you is worth every penny!
B000CN7AHG|1|Used these in 2009 to replace the original factory sway bar bushings on a 1997 Nissan Maxima. The factory bushings were still intact, just stiff and compressed. Now in 2001, after two years of normal use, the Energy Suspension bushings have separated into pieces and appear to be completely destroyed, causing some bad squeaking from the sway bar. Given that the factory bushings lasted 12 years and weren't even nearly as deteriorated as the Energy Suspension bushings were after 2 years, I give this product only one star.
B0012X4BHW|5|Camry 99 XL. The hardest part of the strut replacement was the initial loosening of the strut mount bolts  - a 2' breaker bar and a 19mm 1/2&#34; socket still required a bit of muscle. but after that it was straightforward. It was a one-man job for a handyman/inexperienced mechanic. There's a good video on Youtube (www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KwBurD0KCY) - the only discrepancies being it refers to 22mm bolts, but are in fact 19mm, and fails to mention removing the clip for the ABS wire. I would add that a 12mm offset wrench is necessary to reach the far upper strut mount bolt for the initial loosening and final tightening, a 12mm rachet wrench makes loosening and tightening these bolts easy, and that a small flashlight placed above the upper mount holes facilitates locating the new strut from below if you are working alone. The first side took me a little over two hours, and the second, a little over an hour
B00029NA5G|5|This is perfect for my Shorelander trailer, because it already has holes in the metal of my trailer, in which these will slide right into and bolt on from the bottom. this isn't my first purchase of these, i've been using these for years and just got 6 more.
B004K5E2BO|4|A good product is just as good as oem part. I just installed the item a day ago. No real chance to test the item.
B000CCDG34|4|good quality and comparable price !!
B000EDST1K|5|Good product.
B0000WZZTO|5|I had to replace a previous pair that lost to a deer. I love the lamp quick connections that make replacement easy.
B000BQSKA0|1|This is what happens when greenies are in charge of product design. An unusable piece of trash.  I'm an experienced mechanic and a professional engineer and I can't get this stupid spout to deliver ONE drop of gas.  \\"turn it till it clicks\\" the instruction line (you only get ONE line of instruction)... click? It's clicks in about 20 positions you knotheads !<br /><br />I will be requesting a product refund from the manufacturer.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS TOTALLY DIS-FUNCTIONAL ECO DESIGN NIGHTMARE!
B00HX2Q2NW|4|Generic color & look etc., but that's what it is.
B001PYCO04|5|exact replacement for an old truck
B00062ZHTG|5|I bought this dual line to replace the old one on my brothers 789 double pumper on his 55 Chevy.  Works great and did not give any problems.
B00JWZCO9Y|1|This is not what I expected ! I expected a wire boot of some kind to pass wire through not an anti chafe grommet that I can get at the locale hardware store.  This picture is misleading, the wire and weather boot should be take out of the picture
B0049J3SK2|1|Mine arrive in a torn up box with loose metal parts clanging around inside.  I would have refused delivery but the person delivering said it was like that when he picked it up and the people who gave it to him were certain all inside was fine.  Also it seemed like the kind of product that should survive rough handling.  Upon opening I found loose nuts and bolts all over the box.  I started organizing the parts and noticed I was missing three of the small supports that connect the top rail to the bottom.  As there are 7 other small supports plus 2 large supports and 2 reflectors that act as supports, I decided to put it together anyway and then contact the manufacturer for replacement of the missing parts.  After finishing I looked through the manual for an 800 number to call for missing parts.  Much to my surprise there isn't one.  There is no manufacturer information at all.  Not an address, not even a name.  I'm going to contact \\"t-motorsports\\" but they seem to be a retailer not a manufacturer, so I'm not expecting much help.  I could return it but after all the work putting it together, I really don't want to.  Also I have a camping trip this next weekend.  I think it will hold up without those three small parts.  I'll just have to strap the stuff I put in it to the base and not the top rail to be on the safe side.<br /><br />Just heard back from T-motorsports.  They won't help me get parts because the order was fulfilled by Amazon.
B0096U0P0U|5|Item as described. Fitted nicely on my Yamaha Supertenere OEM PIAA foglight
B00H29323Y|4|i bought another canbus free LED but they were 6000k in color and did not match my 5000k Phillips ultrawhites on my 2013 bmw r1200rt motorcycle. bought these with reservations about canbus and color, but it works great! so far error free and the colors matched very well to the headlamps and my Clearwater Darla leds. the only issue i had was that its a little too wide for a 168/194 socket even tho it states its designed for it. i had to slight file off each side wih a dremel to get them to fit my parkibg light sockets. other than that, works great!
B00F3SZQQW|1|wrong item for a 2014 wrangler pentastar
B000JYF7EG|2|The pictures and video looked very close to the factory mudguards. I was completely wrong! I had to drill some holes extra holes, and position it a certain way to even fit. In the end, I just removed them because the look wasn't right. Same some your money and just buy the factory OEM mudguards. It will save you some time during installation, and look better.<br /><br />Two stars just because the material of the mudguards it quite good. Otherwise I would rate zero stars for the fit and look.
B002M1F1BS|1|poor description item is listed as &#34; PK/50 &#34; pack of 50 i thought it is only one
B005JU5YCU|5|great performance blade
B007NEN0M6|5|Quick and easy way to make you truck look better. Shipping was on time. Thanks!
B00QFSAPP6|5|I ORDERED THE DUAL HARNESS AT THE SAME TIME (BUNDLED) I ORDERED THE 2 LED 18WATT FOG LIGHTS FOR MY PORSCHE. HOWEVER, I WAS SENT THE SINGLE HARNESS UNIT! WHICH I PROMPTLY RETURNED AND RE-ORDERED THE DUAL HARNESS.<br />NOW I LOVE THE BUILD QUALITY AND PRICE BUT I HAVE NOT AS YET INSTALLED IT IN THE PORSCHE SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP. MY ONLY QUESTION IS WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD SOMEONE BE SO DUMB AS TO SEND A SINGLE HARNESS WITH 2 LIGHTS IN THE SAME BOX! ?!@#^&$#%* AND END UP WASTING THE RETURN POSTAGE, THE GASOLINE, TIME AND WEAR OF THE UPS TRUCK AND MAN POWER ETC. WHEN A LITTLE BIT OF GREY MATTER INTEROGATION WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ITEMS JUST DESCRIBED AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WASTE ON THIS GREAT PLANET<br />BRUCE P.D.,, MD, PH.D -- AND NO I AM NOT A BRAIN SURGEON JUST A REGULAR DOC, HIV SPECIALIST THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
B004W5TTHE|5|Bought these for my Chevy van and it was exactly what it said it was and worked like a dream.
B001EOV3FM|5|Worked flawlessly on our 8,000 mile cross-country summer trip. Loaded and unloaded too many times and didn't have to worry at all. Easy to install (took me about 90 minutes). I youtubed it and had no trouble understanding the directions. I didn't need any additional tools to purchase. Used a crowbar and WD-40 for the muffler hooks and it was easy.
B00075OSBK|5|THIS IS MY 3ED RED TOP BATTERY MY 1ST ONE WENT FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS ; I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT OPTIMA JUST BUY IT AND FORGET IT YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH.
B009DPP6QQ|4|Works great
B00BEIUKGQ|4|Great product actually came with built in sun glasses. Love it.
B001ILHPK8|5|great
B00684TAYY|5|Was skeptical @ first but I purchased 2 & they are identical to the ones tht came with my car & it only took 2 or 3 mins to program...AWESOME!!!
B00QGNSD6S|5|I put these not on the driver area of the seatbelt but instead from where the seatbelt emerges from the floor to the b pillar. This stops the annoying flapping in a wrangler with the tops off. 5 stars for a logo product that is serving a great purpose.
B008ESJ68M|5|Exact match for my 2012 terrain very good quality and easy install, only remove two bolts and old one pops out, new one work like a charm
B00KL3ALGO|5|Excellent product especially for protecting our precious granddaughter during our blazing hot Summers!
B0044FKQVA|1|Nice looking; but noisy bearing. Pulley is not &#34; slip &#34; friendly without over-tightening the belt causing premature bearing failure. Put back old alternator after taking it apart and doing a thorough cleaning. ( Works Fine ). I'll keep this chrome one as a spare.
B0002ILK6I|5|Excellent product with high cranking amps. Installed in my BMW K1200GT, replacing the OEM Gel-cell for significantly less money. The battery is a little smaller requiring a couple shims to make sure it doesn't move around or come loose, otherwise it is a perfect replacement battery for my bike.  Also bought the SAE Terminals making for easier connections even though the battery came with the right angle terminals others complained about not getting withe their battery. [[ASIN:B0002ILK6I Odyssey PC680-P  Battery]] Bought the battery for $116 through Amazon Prime with free shipping and had it in two days. The terminals were about an extra $10.00.[[ASIN:B0002ZR4UC Brass SAE Automotive Battery Terminal Set for Hawker Odyssey Batteries]]
B000C7YRNM|4|works as it should
B000JFN9WW|4|I have used other evac systems some better than others, but this one is pretty solid. By pulling the oil through the dip tube it makes the job a little cleaner and you don't have the possibility of damaging the threads on you oil pan. I use it on my BMW because the filter is mounted on top of the motor and it is a pita to even get to the drain plug. If you do your own car, motorcycle or watercraft maintenance, you owe it to yourself to have this handy.
B000MDZLR2|4|Very good product. Fits nicely, easy to put on, and so far standing up to the desert heat. I will update review based on quality over time if there are issues
B003O77B3K|5|Installed, as per instructions. Works well.
B001S7ZT5A|5|Works great for our glass shower.
B00GF0B8DC|4|It is universal , by this I mean it has different size mounts but it did not fit my 2004 Chevy Trailblazer.....
B004IAI4SI|3|Cute but flimsy.
B00MOYJ0YW|3|Works great fit perfect for 02 eclipse visor lights, I only give it 3 stars because shipping was late even with 2 day paid shipping
B00OZYHOE2|5|Great glasses for the price. I am using these while I exercise outside during these negative temperatures in the Northeast US. Blocks the wind well. I highly recommend them to you.
B001JQECY4|5|i love this so much. i've wanted it for so long and i dreamed that my car was gutted on a shady street and my first thought was yay my new car will have a batman wheel cover! next day i ordered it. the new material smell is a little strong but it dissipates and it's worth it anyway. other reviews say you need incredible strenth/special tools to put a wheel cover on, not true. well, brute strength helps, but there's a very easy method to putting on a new wheel cover: 1)position it the way you like at the top of the wheel. 2)use one hand to pull toward the bottom and the other hand to start wrapping the cover around the wheel. 3)once your hands meet up again at the bottom of the wheel, switch hands and wrap the other side of the cover around the wheel. a person with little muscle mass will struggle a bit, but anybody can do this in less than 5 minutes. the cover fits perfectly, doesn't slide at all, and it's beyond awesome.
B008D89EY4|5|brother loves it
B00MNYRQ3A|1|These are a cheap knock-off of the original Kawasaki part.  There is no swivel for the stock chain lanyard.  Not worth the price.
B00FYX2OJS|4|The heads covers is to square for my 2010 Toyota Tacoma ! but the seats covers are nice!!
B0031I2SKS|5|Perfect fit on my wife's '12 Malibu
B000CPI5Z0|5|Redline SI-1 is the best fuel system cleaner you can buy, it's MSDS Sheet shows that it and Chevron Techron share the same active ingredient that DOES NOT DAMAGE rubber and other parts harsh cleaners can damage. Redline is much more concentrated then Techron and I've seen a 1-2MPG gain after using this in almost every single car I have come across in the last 3 years. A must buy for every car owner. For best results use after every oil change to ensure no carbon buildup, clean injectors, ports, and fuel lines!
B003KXLGBQ|1|Don't be fooled.. This a not a access!! It's a Tonnosport!!
B00ELQ48BQ|5|Very happy with it. It fit perfectly.
B0097MWUUU|4|Part came fast. Looks identical to the original and functioning perfectly. BUT IT DOES NOT COME WITH ITS OWN SCREWS/BOLTS, and factory bolts did not fit two of the three holes. No worries, had no trouble finding a couple 10mm socket head cap screws that fit--at Lowes.<br /><br />DIY Install? Like many of you, I followed the videos found on youtube. Yes, the L-shaped connecting metal rod is difficult to pull out of that plastic thing holding it... just remember you can destroy the plastic, as you are going to be throwing it away. But actually, the most difficult *for me* was removing the handle from the door even after it was completely detached--bolts, metal rod, etc. The fit was so tight I actually ended up taking the car to a body shop to do it. They even had trouble getting it out. But for $20 cash, they put the whole thing back together for me.<br /><br />Yes, I would do it again :)
B0068MVD28|5|so much better to replace yourself than to pam MB $300.00 for a service.
B000V0G3B4|3|A lot of people here apparently really like this stuff.  I don't know yet if it really works well, since I just used it today.  I can tell you what it's like to apply this product, however.<br /><br />First, the bottle warns you not to spray it on your steering wheel and other surfaces where your grip is important.  I accidentally sprayed some on mine, and they're not kidding -- you don't want stuff on your steering wheel.  My wheel now has an icky, tacky feeling to it, and it's taking me forever to clean it off.<br /><br />Similarly, be careful when you spray need your windshield.  Cleaning this stuff off the glass is not easy, either.<br /><br />Since this stuff is a protectant and not just a cleaner, it's a little more work to apply it.  You have to let it sit on the surface for two minutes before wiping it off.  This can be tricky, because this stuff is runny.  You really need to soak a cloth and wipe it on to get your surfaces covered properly, and I recommend wearing rubber gloves while you do.<br /><br />I also sprayed some on one of my wheels.  Sure, it looks shiner, but I'm not sure what the point is.  It won't take long for my wheels to get dirty again, and this stuff is not going to protect my wheels from nails and other road hazards.
B00EZWCFAM|5|Easy to use well designed no problems using it on newer pr older snowmobiles.
B004LQCG7E|2|Are these scratch and dent bars? My BullBar was OK, but came damaged and missing hardware, price was right but could have gotten a TJM bar for same price. Next time I'm going TJM bar!
B0045XRK06|4|Very bright and I love the on/off tap at the top of the light. However the cord is just too short.
B000E3CYJ8|5|They work very real.  I would recommend this product to anyone. Nice and comfortable when the temp. drops to -40.
B000CQOIVE|5|I installed this into my 2009 Chevy Traverse with the towing package so all I had to do was connect the controller's wires to the factory-supplied harness.  It took about 30 minutes.  NOTE: Do not follow the color codes for GM that are included with the controller. Call the dealer or look on the web for the correct wiring colors for the factory harness.  Installation looks sharp with the ball mount - much better than the traditional metal bracket.
B003UM7B98|4|It is heavy , very heavy , but work very well.
B002IAPOSS|5|Snug fit.  Very helpful to keep car cool.
B000RPG0DO|5|After installing this layer of insulation under the center console of my vehicle the temperature inside the console must have dropped 20° I'd say this product performed great.
B000CIADLG|4|I purchased two of these kits while on flash-sale, to power my storage-shed / garage which is detached from the house.<br /><br />Upon unpacking each panel for inspection, I checked open voltage.  Each panel ranged in the mid-20's on a cloudy day, so things were looking up for them to provide the power I needed.<br /><br />Upon assembling the first kit, I checked voltage (after regulator), and it was a steady 14V.  After hooking up my 100Ah deep-cycle battery, the kit was actually providing 4.8A @ 14V... which is 67.2W (actually more than the rating of the panels).<br /><br />After using the single kit for testing purposes before mounting on the roof, I have determined that these panels output consistently 55-62W of power on the average day when directly facing the sun.  On cloudy/rainy days, or if axis is off (early morning/late evening), output drops, but does not cut out to zero until panels drop below 20W total.<br /><br />Right now, I have both kits feeding two 100Ah batteries, and those batteries are feeding (via 2A charge controllers) my motorcycle and mower batteries to keep them topped off over the winter.  I also have set-up 20-meters of SMD LEDs along the roof-beams of my shed, and another 20-meters under the awning of my car-port... all serviced from the storage capacity of the two 100Ah batteries.<br /><br />The panels have no issues keeping the two 100Ah batteries topped off daily, even if I forget and leave the LEDs on all night in the shed.<br /><br />I'll eventually add more panels, and another battery or two to my system so I can provide power to my hand-tools, a small compressor, 12V stereo (for tunes while I work), and I also plan to add in a Raspberry Pi to collect data from my panel's output (and my small weather station)... all powered by these panels!<br /><br />I dropped one star on these panel kits because of these minor reasons:<br />1) The PVC frame is VERY cheap.. but since I'm mounting to a metal frame and then onto my roof... the PVC framework is a moot-point for me... But I have used it during testing of the panels (might be okay for temp set-ups while camping?)<br />2) The charge controller is rather cheap and inconsistent in regulation... also has lots of power loss as compared to a higher-end unit.<br />3) The connectors provided with the kit still require you to strip wires and use wire-nuts or other connectors at the charge controller.... not everything is \\"modular\\" as it should be.<br />4) There is only one ring-connector set provided (for direct connection to small battery)... which does not have a modular connector... it has bare wires, which make it okay for connecting to my battery bank, but not okay if you were looking for connectivity (permanent) to your motorcycle/car/mower/etc.<br />5) Footnote, really... As some have noted, Positive and Negative at the modular connectors don't match up correctly to other 2-pole modular connectors... verify polarity BEFORE you connect things up to aftermarket or other supplier's connectors!!!  If necessary, you'll need to cut connectors from existing and re-wire them... or reverse polarity at the ring-connectors at the battery to make things work correctly.  Double and Triple-check your polarity!!!ramework is a moot-point for me...

B005PW3XNE|1|This helmet is not Hi-Vis yellow, it is rain boot yellow. and it is the loudest helmet I have ever owned, I would not recommend purchasing it.
B00GEIIQ12|5|Works as advertised.  Easy installation and decent build quality.  No more flickering on my HIDs!
B008PM4LAK|3|Did not work
B003FBV8ZW|5|These Sunglasses didn't disappoint they are great was exactly what I needed they work like they should. Great product at a great price.
B009I71ZBE|5|Looks F%@&#$!@ AWSOME!<br />Easy to install. Fit Perfect right out of the package
B000SKYL9I|5|I own a 2005 Honda Civic Hybrid and this 0W-20 synthetic oil is just perfect.  Until recently, this price (just under $10 a quart) was the best I could find anywhere.  However, the Wal-Mart in my area has started to carry the 5 quart jugs of Mobil 0W-20 for about $23.  Obviously, I am going to shop locally now but if you can't get the synthetic oil this is a good option.
B00GU2179U|1|It didn't fit my car spare tire. Although, it was clearly mentioning that it would fit for the Toyota FJ cruiser. And mine is the basic range, without any adjustments or so.<br />So I just wasted 40 dollars + shipping.
B003R2RTUW|5|It worked
B00390X6MW|5|Nice product for the $$$.  Comes with 4 stainless steel screws.  Magnetic closure on the door.  Says without drilling but I found it easier to drill a very very small pilot hole in the plastic ring.  The screws were not self-tapping as the directions stated.  Install time 10 minutes.  Becareful with the alignment before doing the 1st screw !
B004XJNPME|3|Sadly, I'm another user who found that this stain doesn't stay on much longer than lipstick.  But it didn't run or smear so those are bonuses.  I also like the color (Forever Fuchsia) a lot.  I ordered a two-pack, one was already pretty dried out, one was moist and colorful.  Overall I rate it better than non-stain lipstick.
B009ERKC0I|5|works great good price easy install no more slamming tailgate
B00CP6IA3Q|5|Surprisingly easy to install.  Works perfectly.
B000BPR13I|5|Works really slick with other Camco products.  It's really high quality and that is what you want in an RV sewer hose.  You don't want failure in your &#34;stinky slinky&#34;.
B003OSIHXW|1|The same experience as many other reviewers.  The rubber portion becomes separated from the rest of the wiper blade.  It is a poor design.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.  Hard to believe that wiper blades have been in used for many years and all of a sudden someone like GY manufactures (or puts their name on) an inferior product that you can't rely on when needed.
B0041G1XMS|5|My husband loves this jacket for biking. Fit is great, apperance is nice, good comfort, and protection seems great. Recommend.
B008G3KG70|5|Great product timely shipping
B00BQWQLQI|2|these throw no more light than standard bulbs...notice no difference
B00496LM4E|5|Perfect air filter.  Fit perfectly and I saved money by not buying from a car dealership parts room.
B0068FYB24|5|Extremely happy with the quality of the speakers and the speed of delivery.  The installation was easy and fitment was perfect.
B008KPYCVU|3|I purchased 2x heavy duty waterproof ATV covers. They were suposed to cover my two ATVS (Artic Cat). Should fit up to 99&#34; length. The covers are OK. They are nylon with better quality, water repellent and made with good material, but they are not HEAVY DUTY ATV COVERS FOR TRAILER. They have one long strap capable to round the entire ATV, but only one.<br />When you buy products on the internet you are not able to touch them, so I will assume I bought those looking for a REAL HEAVY DUTY ATV COVERS to transport my ATVs from on place to another without worries. They are acceptable.<br />These covers are good, but in my opinion will not last long than I wish.<br />Kapsco in a good seller and my product arrived on time, as expected. Very well set up in a paper box.
B0013TNFYU|4|Good value
B005CO9TC4|5|Purchased a cheap manifold set from Harbor Freight. On 2nd use, high pressure hose blew off fitting. Called HF. HF does not sell replacement parts. The manifold and gauges look OK, so I purchased these hoses. The yellow hose will not fit, but I knew that ahead of time. Robinair is a leading name in A/C service equipment.
B000I51KQA|4|Took two hours to install on 2014 Ram 1500, but looks awesome at night. Speedy delivery.
B000X3EUTQ|5|quiet and perfect fit for my sentra 2007, replacement was easy just check on youtube for sentra 2007 brake pad replacement.
B001CF3J96|5|Worked exactly as advertise.  Had to removed the top most weather stripping because the fitment was too tight to lock, but the 3 other sides keep it fitting nice and snug.
B004HE1YP0|5|AC Delco is GM's OEM, have used them for years without issue on all standard GM Vehicles. Put them in my Girlfriend's 2000 Town and Country and they work good. Looked good and have not had an issue in over a year since I replaced them. Easy install and 1/2 the price for the part and a 1/4 the price if you do it yourself.
B004O7DBM4|5|caught a kid rummaging through a storage compartment outside my motorhome after dark, and decided i needed this.  works perfectly.  i agree with others, this should be standard equipment on all new rv's.  flip your porchlight switch on, and the light's on, off, then back on, and it's on standby, monitoring your home.  love it.
B00AN5SG94|4|They went on easily and work well.
B007F83GOM|1|This is just two white decals on a metal frame. Not an actual illest product. Plus the ones from illest are cheaper. I was very disappointed with the quality as well. The decals were not centered and were crooked.
B004L02ZLM|5|I used this item to cover my 5x10 Utility Trailer with raised mesh sides.  I had formerly used products like 3M Scotchlite, but that was too expensive to get good coverage on my trailer.  Upon receiving this product, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.  I cut the roll down the middle, effectively getting 60' of 1\\" Tape, and the 1\\" width fit the side rails perfectly, and it gave me enough to get all sides of the trailer covered.  It says put when applied, and lights-up as good as any other high quality Conspicuity tape.  I recommend it.
B004IYWJQ2|5|Good fit. Easy installation
B00I2Y7I5G|5|These lights look great after I installed them in my doors! Super easy to install(complete in 30 mins)and comes with the drill bit. Great quality product too!
B00BJ8FED0|5|Fast shipment and great products you will love their work it's awesome they are great and fast I love my new wheel and seat belt covers
B003UT3S6Q|2|For the very harsh smelling and eye-burning experience I had with this product, I expected more.  I still needed to scrub the aluminum rims extensively after using, and my vehicle is less than six months old.  I cleaned the wheels with soap and water and a scrub brush and received similar results.
B000B66UUW|5|Worked great and easy to install
B000BQURHE|5|This belt is a good substitute for the MTD brand auger Belt # 954-0257 and 754-0257 for the MTD 5 horsepower 24 inch snow blower model 317-550-000. And it costs 3.5 times less.
B00HDERBLC|2|This might be OK for wimpy little loads, but nothing more. The 120 volt output drops to 90 volts with a small 60 watt load. I tested it without a load when I received it, noted the 120 volt output, and set it aside for emergency use. I have a self-made inverter I use daily, and when it stopped working today, I hooked this one up and was amazed at the poor power output. It's too late to return or exchange it (my fault!). If you buy one, test it under load immediately! I couldn't find any info regarding a guarantee anyplace, so BEWARE!      UPDATE! TODAY I RECEIVED A CALL FROM XSHADE WANTING TO REPLACE THIS DEVICE WITHOUT CHARGE, EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT IT OVER 4 MONTHS AGO. I DID NOT EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN AND AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE!
B0026MCRK6|5|Fit my 1999 hyundai accent three door drivers side door just fine.  To get the window crank off just youtube it, I used a rag that I wedged in between the crank and door panel and sawed it back and forth a bit then pulled back and off it came.  You have to make sure you're on the right side of the spring clip though in order for it to work.
B009I6GU9M|2|A couple minor flaws in the metal which I grid down.  Seems lighter than the original and fit is not 100% even after i purhased new bracks which also are not a great fit.  Otherwise ok for the price.
B00PFG52DO|5|Arrived quickly & very high quality installed easily looks great I'd buy again if needed
B004804NNI|5|What can I say.  It pretty much does what you need it to do.  Make sure you get the right fit because mine was a little to small, but no big deal.  Don't want to spend time on returning and waiting for next product.  Must Have.  BTW...easy installation.
B004HJEUG0|3|It's a pretty descent helmet considering it only cost around $30. The only problem I had was it took me a while to stop getting headaches whenever I wear it.
B000BLNTME|4|Gave it 4 stars because it Came on time. Fast shipping. Not what I wanted, these were high beams I was looking for basic headlights. Too late to return after mechanic opened. Decided to keep. Had to head on over to Autozone and purchase a $20 one. Crazy.
B00OYKSXO2|5|works well.  Easy to install but weak on the instructions.  The green wire ties into your high beam power switch and the red wire to your wig wag switch
B0081S8PD2|5|Good part.  Thanks.
B0010ADH72|5|I needed a new MAF sensor for my 1998 Volvo S70 non turbo. I read that they only recommend the use of Bosch for this situation. The sensor is about two years old and is still going strong. It immediately remedied my strange idling and stalls that happened with my old/failing sensor. The sensor is actually mounted in the plastic manifold shown in the picture. This is so you can't actually touch the element in the sensor. Theses things are extremely fragile so handle it with car upon installation.
B004W13KUK|1|did not fit the Taurus 2012 properly... broke when window was put up
B0092R6PNI|1|3 Year Durability no warranty. What that means is it should last 3 years. For 3 years  It will look absolutely like crap but the plastic used will still be partially there. Mine faded after about a year, and at 2 years now it's pealing up and edges are chipping off. I had a military decal on one corner it faded out and when I pealed it off it's such a dark black surrounded by a horrid grayish faded Crappy looking rear window decal. I contacted Crabtree about how its durability did not make it to 3 years. The response an I will copy paste it was: I am so sorry to inform you but there is nothing we can do for you other than you reorder a new graphic at your own expense.<br /><br />Such a delightful company. So if lucky you might have a speck left after 3 years.
B007NNH1V8|5|Fit perfectly, works great,arrived in perfect shape.
B00JR33EPY|4|It was said to meet the specifications of the original lighted grip bar. It came up a little shorter than the original which means it left screw holes exposed.
B0009IQZH0|5|I love these towels as I have black cars that when using other towels, they leave a smudge but these towels get the car clean without the smudges and leaves the car sparkling clean.
B007ZJZJMS|5|The 1996 Toyota Camry headlight assembly was well packed and arrived in good condition.  Lenses were very clear and OEM design.  Both low-beam (9006 55W) and high-beam (9005 65W) headlight bulbs were included.  Fit was good.  Left/right aim adjustment is controlled by a plastic knob which can be turned by hand if you apply enough force.  Height aim adjustment is controlled by a phillips-head machine screw easily accessable from the top.  Headlight assembly spreads the light evenly and illuminates the road well.<br /><br />Installation hints:  Grill must be removed.  There are two horizontal bolts recessed into the front of the grille with heads (10 mm hex) toward the front of the car.  A 10 mm long socket worked well for me, but a regular socket with an extension would work too.<br />Side marker light must be removed to reveal hidden nut.  Remove the philips-head screw at the outside top of the headlight, and slide the side marker light FORWARD toward the front of the car.  The side marker light must be slid forward or the plastic pin may break.  When the side marker light is removed, the 10 mm nut which holds the headlight assembly on can be removed.  Then slide the headlight assembly toward the center of the car to remove the headlight-assembly stud from the fender hole.<br /><br />I read that there is an installation video on YouTube.
B0089LSV62|4|nothing to rave about. after all its oem replacement part and not an upgrade. dropped right in and the car is now breathing clean air.
B00UT34OUU|1|Beware, this says lot of 10 pieces but its only for 1. Don't get tricked like I did.
B00C7OVF7O|4|Works great even just to blast the rims before going into the touch less wash in between full scrub downs
B000C9IVFK|5|Excellent quality
B000CNB4U0|5|I use this in combination with the Addco-sway-bar, i`ts great on the bending roads in Europe.
B000AS3D3S|5|best filter for ford 5.4L engine!
B00411JRBM|5|Like the bigger size which really makes a difference in your left and right rear vision. Decent quality which gives the mirror the ability to stay in the position you set. I hope they maintain this quality over time.
B000VU7MOQ|5|fit perfectly
B004O844DS|5|I always expect the worst when trying to assemble something like this, so when I only had minor difficulties, I was pretty happy. If you find the holes on this rack are not lining up, you probably did like me, & have a bracket or clip reversed, or upside down. Unfortunately, the illustrations aren't a lot of help since they're so small, & not even in english...but like I said, I expected that. The attaching nuts are extremely difficult to install, but a 1-1/4\\" socket fits right over them! 10 times faster & easier to tighten!! If you don't have that socket, I'd suggest ya save yourself the struggle & replace them with 6M-1.0 nuts. Then you can use a ratchet or wrench. One other thing, if you have a big SUV (like my Durango) go ahead & order the extension. You'll be a lot happier with the look. With all that said, I'm extremely happy with this rack. Looks great, very sturdy, & if you have a big socket, easy to take off & on.
B0023VKWLQ|5|Arrived on time and fit really well, it didn't have much play and looked like how it was from the factory on my girfriends 2005 liberty
B007EHOWNI|5|The antenna was everything I expected to be.  The installation directions were clear and it works fantastic.  This antena was for a Lexus RX 300 year 2000
B005G9B2PM|4|worked great
B00GT3BJMU|4|This mit was nicer than I expected.  It's very large (long), which will be nice for sweeping the snow, with a big scraper that has a nice covered handle inside.  It's got a nice sturdy feel, and I love the vivid red color.
B008AGKU10|4|The GMAX GM11D is a good buy for the price.  Use it with our ATV, Side by side, and dual sport motorcycle.  Good all around helmet. Only limitation is when riding on the highway above 55 mph use care when turning your head to look to the side... you will experience some wind whip of the helmet.  I would buy this helmet again.
B003MRMPZQ|5|I wad looking for a sleek yet discrete logo and this one meets the birds eye.  Perfect :style to match my Honda accessory finish-)
B0031I80AA|5|Great item
B000NBYDWW|5|This tool works perfectly for changing the oil on my Mazda 3.  I have now used it twice for my oil changes and have had no problems.
B007NNH0FK|5|Excellent buy. Almost same price for chrome as not chrome. Win-Win. Great perfornance.
B000RHZO7U|5|I bought this wrench to hold the flywheel on outboard engines while I am torquing down the flywheel nut, for this use the unit works perfect. It is built to last and obviously much stronger than many of the plastic models. I highly recommend this item.
B00DH8D1OY|5|Awesome product, perfect quality
B000CP2HOU|5|worked perfect.
B00FAHM8CG|1|eCustomhitch told my mechanic it doesn't work on all advertised Passats.  After it was installed by my mechanic there was no right blinker and no brake lights.
B00852QTIC|3|I'm sure this works perfectly but the plastic wheels smelled like gas. This was delivered the same day as new living from furniture and I kept spraying the furniture thinking maybe it was from sitting in a warehouse somewhere. Finally realized it was the box with my dolly. Opened it up and am letting it sit outside for a few days.<br /><br />The dolly looks very heavy/sturdy and can't wait until I get to use her out!!
B000COSMNG|5|Got these with NGK t55's at .060 gap and oh my. The car feels like its new again! Like the look of the wires and the size!<br /><br />Note: WILL FIT SUPERCHARGED 3800'S IF you go under the snout of the supercharger! They will not go over it the proper way! Otherwise, buy longer wires or make your own.
B005MEZIYM|3|I AM TRYING TO RETURN THE ITEM, BECAUSE THERE'S NO SLOTS TO HOLD THE BOTTOM OF THE PLATE!
B005OVLAXQ|5|Just what the doctor ordered
B00DDOSNH2|4|They are much brighter than the old incondesant  bulbs.  Color is good and they do not get hot.
B000C11JHU|1|As a fan of Amazon, this is a first, and major, disappointment.  The item is advertised as a \\"Dorman 741-551\\" (window regulator with motor) sold by jkdautoparts, with a Dorman warranty.<br /><br />But the item received has no markings as a Dorman product, no packaging as a Dorman product, nothing indicating it as part number 741-551, and was shipped by Davis Auto Sales.  No Dorman, no warranty, and different seller!!  No identifying markings on the part at all!<br /><br />The \\"switch\\" between advertised and shipped is shown by the packaging and packing slip, which used a completely different part number.  So the part seems to be a non-Dorman, possibly knock-off, part of questionable quality and origin.  Amazon can do much, much better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the part is needed without further delay and enough time has been spent waiting for delivery.  Don't have more time to waste returning it and waiting for a new order.  Hope to never see Amazon doing so poorly again.
B000EVYGZA|5|I had no experience with electrical work when I bought this to work on an auto restoration project. This thing is so useful and costs a fraction of other meters that you would see in stores. Highly recommended.
B002P8EMK4|5|Fits like original.
B00B3V2S9G|3|Looked great for about 6 months then started to peel off
B000GV5Q3Y|5|Springs were great. Check on RaceTech's website for their spring rate calculator, so you know what you should be choosing.
B0002SA3X4|5|March through November this is the only top on my '87 YJ, and only when raining hard.
B000LNBLTK|5|A while back I tried to remove trim from a car door to perform some repairs. I did not have the right tools and the task was difficult without damaging the door.<br /><br />Later on I wanted to install an amplifier+sub in my car. I knew I'd have to remove trim to have a clean install and knew I needed tools to succeed. I bought these and it made the job very simple with the help of a shop manual for my car to show where all the clips were.
B0027QR2SI|4|it is great. I just wish it were wider.
B005C4MHZK|5|This shoulder brace is perfect for either shoulder. Easily adjusted to give the most support with comfort. Read reviews of other braces that weren't easy to adjust on the left. This is exactly what I thought it would be. Only wish it was machine washable, you know lazy teenagers.
B00F7GZI68|4|Was way bigger than expected.
B0041QFOWI|4|I put this bag on a 2006 Triumph America and the passenger seat is 9\\" wide and the bottom of this bag doesn't make it around the passenger seat. The side pouches get pushed in leaving less room and the passenger pad is very tall leaving less room in the main section of this bag. None of this is the bags fault but more the fit on the bike. I can put my Frog Togg top \\"which is rain gear\\" in this bag and the main section is full. The bag itself seems to be of very good quality but on the small side. I am not sure how waterproof it will be but time will tell.
B002UC6PIM|5|as a replacement button for the outside emergency pump shutoff button I broke off on my 2004 fleetwood gearbox 260fb toy hauler.  easy to plug right in and then screw the bottom bracket on and snap the outer top on and i'm not really a handy man.
B0041TQU14|5|good product and great price.
B000WJX3R6|5|These are great batteries!
B00CEFIQ2I|5|Good quality.  Easily applied.
B00BLPVGJM|5|Thanks *:)
B004RCRS9I|5|IT is Very GOOD I am HAPPY.
B001EP0GMW|5|Solid--straightforward install (about an hour for me and my carpal tunnels).  THICK paint.  American made.  Perfect fit.  Everything needed was in the box.  Can't ask for more...
B003ULSUIU|5|buenas noches disculpe por los problemas ocasionados com mi tarjeta de cr&eacute;dito que no se a podido hacer el pago del cilindro lo que pasa es que yo cancele una orden y no me an devuelto el monto de la cancelaci&oacute;n de los productos por eso no e podido hacer el cobro del cilindro gracias
B001GJ7CUK|2|The Guide had to sit too far out to guide and center the boat which was what I was looking for.  Also not tall enough.  I have a 18 ft runabout on a RZ load trailer.
B000E3EWJ8|3|I thought this wheel cover was adorable, but I don't know if I have a small steering wheel or what, but the cover didn't fit right at all, it was too big and sat on the wheel funny so it wasn't comfortable on my hands. And it had a very powerful smell to it when I first got it. I think I only left it in my car for about a week before I took it off.
B000UV8FRE|5|I bought these lights 3 years ago and they still work! Best interior lights and these are the only ones I will tell my friends to buy.
B001HATUIK|5|I've used their products for years, quality seems consistent and functional, no issues.  Plus, all the spare parts are available too.
B000XBBISO|5|This new version of the valve assembly has a plastic lower cap.  My original had a brass cap.  But it seems to work just fine
B000EQ9H6S|5|Fits my 98 civic LX.  Who really knows with air filters if they are helping or hindering the engines performance?  The engine runs good and I gained a few MPG's over my super dirty old filter.  I think the Civic EX might have a different air box, but this one definitely fits the LX.
B007ZGBLNW|5|I'm not one to write reviews, but these deserve it. Bought two for the front of a 87 toyota. iIve had Hella, Kc's etc and nothing comes close to these. i will be buying many more and they will go on every rig i have. Mounting hardware isnt the best, I plan to replace with stainless. The lights housing is built well, and is much heavier then i thought id get with 20 dollar lights.  These are awesome.
B00KTI9MAW|5|With Toyota, there is nothing like using OEM for performance!
B003P5TWVK|4|Pretty good quality. Mine had some extra holes where it looks like stitching was removed and redone. Nice thick leather and seemingly very durable. I bought the same vest 2 years ago in a size large. The newer version has upgraded pockets, more snaps and eyelets, a cordura like fabric on all the wear spots and vented liner panel at the neck. It also sports two gun holders on the the inside of the inner pockets. I wouldn't trust them but they are there. The one draw back is the vest smells like a chemical spill when shipped. After a few hundred miles on the road it smells like a dirty biker....just the way it should!
B007HIEV4Y|5|Installed a burly slammer kit on my 09 flhtc and this is the only kickstand that gives it enough lean so I'm not worried about it. I think this is a must have item for a lowered bike.
B005N6XMYW|1|WOW How small for an XXL!! Bought for my sis, I'm a size M & this XXL would fit me! Crap!!
B002ZTGLFC|3|I was surprised at how stiff this line is. I'm not sure if all clear gas-line is this way, but it is somewhat more difficult to work with than rubber line. It does look good though.
B004EK94P4|5|Super wide and fits well. Very strong and visible.
B000BPTVTK|5|The Best.  Works great
B00651C9OI|5|Antenna works great for my 08 Tacoma; I no longer have to hear the antenna whipping the pipes and low ceilings as I drive through parking garages.  there has been no reduction in the radio connection/signal.  Its worked perfectly.
B003PI2BFG|4|You need a shop, stands,a jack, and two people and 2 hours to instal this. Not easy but not impossible<br />.
B0041M9DX8|1|If you are ordering this part for 2002 Chevrolet Blazer do not purchase it does not fit.  They have it listed as being able to fit but it is wrong part number. This is for 1998 Chevrolet Blazer.  The part number you should order is GMB 799-0220 and that is for 1999-2002.  If you go to gmb webpage and search there catalog you can find a pdf that list there product numbers.
B004QEYNL8|3|Bought these in June 2011 and one glove started to come apart at the seam under the end of my right palm. The gloves look really cool but I expect more durability from the pricey Alpine Stars. Actually this is the second set of AS gloves that have given me problems (the previous ones had huge internal seams that would press into your skin. I gave them away. I hope Alpine Stars step up their quality.
B001U522GO|4|Great starter kit for car washing.  You will need a drying towel, but I would recommend this.  Bucket works well to sit on while detailing wheels, etc.
B00SMWLQ74|2|Don't expect this to match OEM or existing trim on your car. The color variation is huge. I emailed Mercedes and got the trim color for my VIN, an then ordered it here. But the one I got wasn't even close to the factory color, and it's a 4 month old car. When I emailed them with a picture, I got this response:<br /><br />&#34;what you showed in the picture it is our walnut burlwood clearly.<br />you didn't order a match OEM kit. so it is not suppose to match whats existing in the car already.&#34;
B0082OU772|4|Gave this as a set to may aunt and uncle as a gift. The loved it. Way to go go...
B00RW3F4X6|5|Worked as it was supposed to. No issues or complaints.
B007Y872YI|5|Tremendous price on a perfectly working item. Installed easily in our 2006 Tahoe, everything lined up just right, my husband couldn't be happier.
B005N53CBQ|4|It's a universal seat cover, so I had to tuck and straighten it to make it fit, but I expected that. The metal eyelets are placed onto very thin material. So when you attach the snaps the material just spreads out and the eyelets just pop off.. I still give it 4 stars because of the price.  I'll buy again if the time comes.
B001DKRKGS|2|too big for our narrow coffee cups, but ok for the kid's large ice tea. will get another smaller one for coffee.
B002FFFKYE|5|The K&N air filter works great! I can't say that I am enthusiastic about having to apply the red oil that it comes with but there is a spray can of the oil that makes the application of it a lot easier and less time consuming. I love the fact that it as a lifetime warranty and as an estimation time of having to clean at 50,000 miles. No need to by air filters anymore!!
B000C9WLA6|5|Wix makes a great filter, much better than OEM filters
B001449I5E|5|Super easy to install and fit my traverse well
B000XBCURW|5|Considering that the spa cover is old and it was looking rather ruff, it  did bring it back considerably and is staying nice. I do suggest , like it say's to do it at least once a month...
B00HLOPYKY|5|Fast shipping.  Very good quality seatbelts!  Thank you
B000BGHVSM|5|This is my second stand for my second trailer.  It can take a lot of weight and has no issues.  It doesn't rot like my old wood blocks did.
B004AE3YRS|5|Came as advertised and fast.
B004VQM8RC|4|Easy to install but have not noticed and increases yet. Price is fair, quality is very good, looks great and sound good
B008G28DSK|1|Fit left?? Or both sides???
B0052XMR0Q|4|Amazon tells me that this product does not fit my 2004 Audi TT. Other sites tell me it does. Ultimately, there was no way of finding out whether I needed the OE or UB version of this wiper blade. I got one of each. The OE version is for those cars that use this style of wiper blade as original equipment and as it turns out, the OE version fits perfectly well once you figure out which of the several adaptors included is required and how to install it on the blade. The instructions are less than clear but after several attempts, I was able to install it. It fits well and operates properly. It rained today so I used it and found that it runs smoothly and without noise or skipped spots. The UB version has a different set of attachments and would not fit with any of the provided adaptors. Based upon the inaccurate information scattered about the web, some related to older iterations of Anco Contour blades, you might want to purchase this at a location where you can try it out and immediately return it if it proves not to fit. Once you know what definitely fits, you can come back to Amazon for future purchases.
B00EEQBVG8|4|Good bang for the buck. Took a little playing with to get the feel for it. Can't share 1 Bluetooth player between 2 helmets but other than that, very satisfied for the price !
B003S6M4Z2|5|All good
B004RDVSMA|5|Great product!  Replaced both and the hatch pops right up. Easy to install and arrived quickly. Good value.  Would recommend.
B004JAXC20|1|does not fit TJ. got bamboozled.
B000C6OLI4|5|Great filter. I have been using it for years in my 1999 ford mustang. It has never let me down.
B0013ERRSK|5|Absolutely love this waterer for my shar pei!  Before we had to follow her around and wipe her face and neck after drinking, not anymore!  The opening is just big enough for her large &#34;meat mouth&#34; so there is no extra room for her jowls to hang in the water like a regular wide open dish. Thank you so much for such a great dish and saving my laminate flooring!
B000JZB42Y|1|I was under the impresion that I was to recieve hardware (nuts,bolts,pins exc.). WRONG just the part (not bad I guess) but I had to reuse the old hardware or buy new ones. Overall I would say not a good transaction.
B00E8CZAWY|5|Installed easily on my Z1000 and works great.
B001C6OZ5W|5|this is a good product for the price. I bought two back in December.  got into an accident. parts was stolen off my truck during the repairs. I everything replace except one wiper arm.
B0028JQYSS|5|Lightweight jack in its own case -- much easier to use than the fiddly thing that came with the car.  Really, the only time you need one is when you don't have one.  I've used it more for other stranded motorists than for myself.
B0088VFGSE|3|A little too long fof my purposes. Two inches would have been perfect. I took it off. Took it off.
B00OMZLK7G|5|WORKED PERFECT
B0089F6SMC|5|He thought it was a fishing license at first but had a big grin when he realized what it was
B007KALCSM|5|I was hoping this license plate frame would be as pretty as pictured and it exceeded my expectations! It looks beautiful framing my Breast Cancer license plate on my new car! Love it!!
B003TNHEO0|5|I bought this seat cushion as a gift for someone.  She does like the seat cushion.  I can't rate it for myself.
B000KL5DIS|4|Good quality but high priced
B00IO68X0Q|4|These rotors look great on my Acura RSX. However,  in my ignorance, I assumed that the black finish depicted in the picture, is how the rotors would stay. Well, that's not the case. As soon as you install them and take the car for a spin, you will &#34;brake&#34; off the black finish and be left with  silver rotors. Oh well, they still look awesome! And actually, it makes the &#34;drilled-and-slotted&#34; more noticeable.
B000BROATE|5|it's for sale if you're interested
B005HV3STW|5|Too cold to put on but I love them.
B0001AQPIU|1|In the second week, probably after used 5 times, the battery stopped working.<br />Right now it turns on only if plugged to the car lighter adapter.<br /><br />I will try to replace the batteries. But I didn't expect to replace that so early.<br />I don't recommend that product. It's makes no sense having a portable dustbuster that works only plugged to a power source.
B004T7Y5EW|1|The paint on these does not stick well..  we do not use our truck off road at all and the paint has came off and has rusted.  very unhappy with this product
B00B3IW48Y|2|Installed over a chrome radiator cover on my motorcycle. It installed just fine but it looks awful. The chrome does not shine through the film. It looks dull.
B006QDLXR4|5|Excellent highly recommended.
B00D3R1QFA|5|I bought this to carry in my car and I have found it to be very comforting to know that I have a device that could save my life.  The item arrived quickly and it was just as described, even better.  I has so many useful tools in case of emergency.  I love it!
B00B856ABO|1|my 2006 Pont G6 has 16&#34; rims.....so no they will not fit as stated above!!  and are not 17&#34; !!!
B001EP29AY|1|Welds are poor, it moves around in the receiver, nothing is square.  The one I received had a big dent and the powder coat was badly scratched, the packaging is not sufficient for UPS shipping.
B00B9SB3FS|5|Thanks
B00687LRWO|5|It was perfect!
B009AQTOP2|5|I use this as a back up light on my RV, I ran separate wires to an LED toggle switch so that if I forget I turned it on the bright red LED reminds me that it's on. Wanna piss off a cop drive down the freeway with this left on. Fortunately, because I was smart and used an LED switch, I've never had that problem. VERY bright!
B000CPAW2O|3|Looks great and looks to be good quality. However, the clamps included will NOT fit a 2.25 inch pipe. I managed to get one clamp barely on and used the included bolts (took other two clamps off. They would not fit) and screwed them into the holes by themselves. It works but if you look too close, it looks kinda funny. But no one will ever look that close. It looks great on my 01 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT.  Added a nice look to the back. So, 3 stars. 5 for the look, minus two for the fit.
B000BYNGLU|1|Not enought air movement
B000DZXIJM|5|This product has to be one of the best car polish's i have ever used being able to use it in hot weather is a bonus as the only place i can wash and polish my car is always in the sun. Would recomend to anybody briliant!
B000SEUWQK|5|Really looks good on my vehicle.  Very satisfied with the product.
B000C5DUN2|5|When my wife's Sport Trac developed holes in the Cruise button, I figured it would be a pain to install replacement buttons. but it was a breeze.  Just search for instructions on how to replace these.<br /><br />They were shipped quickly, look as good as the originals, and work perfectly.<br /><br />(It's much easier to use the existing cables, rather than replace the old ones.)
B00B7OVXWW|5|I have a 2012 rubicon with MT. I have had the unit for close to a year now. I have not had one issue with any of the features. Most difficult part of the install was running the wires behind panel trims. tje initial setup can be a bit time consuming but READ and FOLLOW the directions. It clearly says to update the unit prior to installing to ensure you have the latest updates. Also it's s good idea to connect it to the computer every couple months and check for new updates. I have been to several jamborees and had more functionality and options with this unit them the other jeepers with other tuners. Don't assume it's plug and play. Read the instructions first and you will have no problems and understand the functionality. Also I average 18mpg with 35's on a 5&#34; lift. On the trail tune.
B000C9JWXA|5|This part is used on 1997 Oldsmobile minivan. I works well and fixes my van's rough idle problem. It fits perfectly in place of the original part.
B00TEH7MGU|4|Great except the stickers don't look as detailed as the photo..but still great!
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Easy to install.  Good quality.  Keeps the truck cleaner.
B001GRTEO4|5|You pay for what you get. Even though you pay a little more for WeatherTech floormats, it's a comfort knowing your carpet underneath stays as good as new. What I love about them, right under my gas pedal where the heel rests, the most worn part of the carpet, is now protected by the shaped mat. Listen guys and gals if you want your cars carpet to stay as good as new, Get you a set of these and you'll be glad you did.
B000MUVCXM|5|I use this on my Cub Cadet M48 as a cheaper alternative to the factory brand.  They work the same and are significantly cheaper.
B00776LRS4|5|perfect!!!!!
B00029WYEY|5|This kit does exactly what it is designed to do.
B0032EZG7I|5|This looks so great on my car that I just stand there at times to look at how nice of an addition it is to the sporty look of my Mustang
B004IVAWVO|5|It served it's purpose
B00HNP91VO|5|Stadium-lighting bright, tough and cool-looking.<br />Mounted on the Roll-Over Protection System on my Kubota, used all winter when plowing snow, these lights are GREAT.
B000BUTDCA|1|Risk of fire. The danger is between the 50A breaker at the campground panel and the 30A breaker in the RV. In other words, the 30A cord and where it makes the transition from cord to the RV's 30A hard wire that goes to the RV's breaker panel. I have repaired an RV where the 30A cord/hard wire transition (in a metal junction box) burned up all of the wiring inside the junction box.  If it wasn't for the metal junction box, it would likely have burned up the RV instead. Everything between the campground panel and the RV's breaker panel (internal RV wiring and cord) is designed to carry 30A - and you will be plugging it into a 50A breaker. Ask any electrician about attaching a 30A cord to a 50A breaker.
B0006MTRJ2|3|i did not realize when i ordered it that I actually needed a female end on each end.  so i have not used it.
B001OSHT1A|5|I installed my Versa lift over a weekend, it was easy to install and works great! I doubled my stage space, by fixing up my attic! Makes storing all my classic car parts in the attic a breeze.<br />Great product! Bob
B00C4QG49E|4|GREAT PRICE ,A LITTLE SHAKY ON THE TOP MAKE SURE YOU USE THE CHAIN. PUMPS UP SLOW BUT DID THE JOB
B002MEIWXO|3|I wish it would've came with instructions on how to put it on or something but other than that it came in great condition, clean with all the necessary parts! Thanks!
B002R12G52|5|This light was exactly what I ordered and it came fast. It was in great shape and it was easy to install.
B007LICL56|4|!:)
B00EYF668M|5|Perfect fit at an awesome price
B00A1BMNFI|5|Makes the car look new!!
B0055SYJ8Q|5|Perfect fit.  We haul a lot of stuff back and forth to the lake and it gets a lot of use.  Very easy to clean and protects the carpet very well.
B001NZQID4|5|Fits my 2002 Chevrolet  silverado perfectly. Makes adding the brake controller completely plug and play. Plugs under the dash and directly to the controller.
B0041C8XIE|4|Shipping and installation was fast and easy. Instructions were pretty simple. The exhaust is LOUD at low RPMs but bearable at highway speeds. I installed this with a K&N filter on my 2013 R1 and this thing is a beast! It says no mods needed with just the slip-ons and this is true, but with the filter there is a little more backfire during decceleration. I'll get the ECU reflashed and that'll go away. All in all the performance, looks and price makes it well worth it.
B000CSYQWI|5|so far sooo good
B001THP2I8|4|Thicker formula than most car sealant, but still easy to spread. A little really does go a long way! Coverage doesn't last as long as promised, but most sealants/waxes don't either.
B003A044L8|2|Logistics - very poor. It posted one week for delivery on my order but took nearly 3 weeks to arrive.    Customer Service - very poor. I called 4 times and left 2 emails with no follow up. When I did get through, they did apply partial credit to my order.    Product Fit - easy to install. On the exterior, the mirror is mounted with good contour and fit. However, there is high wind noise, much nosier than before. I have not yet attempted to figure out why.    Notable - When I posted the poorest rating under Amazon, the vendor took notice and initiated remedy - partial credit and reship order. The Amazon Team deserves accolades for setting up this 3rd party rating system. It works.
B0051RTQHK|5|I have no complaints about this oil. I get a good price using the subscribe and save program, way better than an auto supply store. It looks like new oil and haven't noticed anything. My car has a piston ring leak and I go through about a quart a week. Yay Honda :( I would use this in any vehicle.
B00BMRRXSM|5|This item works as described. Durable and a great conversation piece to start your game. Best of all, the interchangeable pieces make it versatile for whatever your drinking. Well done.
B000182DV0|4|Directions were a little confusing but I got it
B004IYC5HU|5|very good item to buy well made im very happy with it<br />just when you buy it make sure from the thickness because when I got mine was bigger the holl in my trailer but I enlarged just to make it fit and its working perfect and very fast shipping and very good packing<br />thank you and I would recommended
B0099M2RYC|1|After reading all of the positive product reviews I thought, this is it.  It will remove the sludge and clean our black tank. Wrong. We live and travel in our rv full time and since we bought it brand new, our rv sensors stopped reading after the first month. I followed the product instructions to a &#34;T&#34; and not only has there been no positive effects on the sensors but this product provides no odor mask when the temperature is above 85 degrees. Considering we currently live in central Texas and the average temp the past two weeks in April has been about 85 degrees, I was forced to buy the normal drop in pellets from Walmart and all is good. This is after pouring in anywhere from 3/4 cup to 1 cup of this Unique Natural. Glad the bottle is gone and on to trying the next &#34;miracle&#34; black tank cleaner.
B004HE3WBY|5|I always use ac delco pads, even for non gm vehicle. I've never had an issue with fit or noise.
B00ANZHG4U|5|AAAAAAA++++++++++
B0010E1LYY|3|have not checked the filter since i installed it 1 month earlier.<br />hopefully it is working good ... have not noticed any difference on engine performance,<br />good price though.
B006NZTZLQ|5|I can connect every time.  Faster than the cheap units.  Sleep mode keeps car battery safe.
B001UMZ07A|5|Very good product
B0073MGHP0|5|I was very hesitant about replacing my radiator with one that was such an excellent bargain price without being able to see it and make sure first.  I was very glad I put aside my fears and went with this brand of radiator.  It arrived so very quickly, and I have been running it in my vehicle for almost a year, and my past problems of overheating are completely over.  I could not tell the difference structurally from the original equipment I replaced this for.  I would definitely recommend this purchase to anybody needing a radiator.
B001JT3292|4|bought to go with the coaxial cable and get better reception than factory installed antena.
B00IOBQDTY|5|Had this item for a little over 6 months. Have yet to install it for other reasons. But the quality is heavy duty and great. Would recommend if you want yo add the look to your car
B00GHT8CF8|5|Fit and color were a perfect match.
B000CPCBF0|5|Best there is for most use. Look into their &#34;Shock Proof&#34; line if you're racing or otherwise beating your vehicle real hard.
B001UG0N1Y|2|I bought mine from autozone, it was the 15\\" blue light though. Theres a knob to control the sensitivity, and if the knob was from 1-100, 1-99.5 is way to sensitive and it will always glow, and you have to BARELY twist it a VERY TINY bit to allow it to pulse to louder music. I set up 2 in my car, god forbid you want to do this, took me a half hour trying to sync both of them to pulse evenly, and they still aren't perfect, just \\"good enough\\" I guess. So if you want just one go for it and get ready to twist the knob with some surgeon hands, if you want more...buy different ones that you can connect to your speakers or head unit.
B0043GTOGS|5|Great product
B00KV7GSB2|4|Direct fit and look good
B001O074JU|4|Product worked great on my 2006 Expedition. I was having a misfire problem and had tried replacing the plugs and fuel filter with no success. Turned out to be a bad coil. The only problem I ran into was one of the new coils had a high pitch chirpping noise when it fired. Luckily Amazon is great for returns so got a new one in two days.
B000TYQJSE|5|very inexpensive
B006XGHL8Y|5|If you have the ability to take the instrument cluster out of your vehicle and know how to solder, you can't go wrong with these! My speedometer stopped working and I bought these and replaced them all at the same time. Very quick install and they've been going strong for quite a while!
B005K97RRA|5|i got this for a solar street light experiment .<br />it is just the right size and capacity for the job .
B002DYH586|5|I verified with Orange Electronic, sales engineer Yang Baron yangbaron@orange-electronic.com that this unit is one of the newer units which transmits tire data only every 30 seconds when the wheels are not turning, every 5 seconds when the wheels are turning. This reduced transmission rate greatly increases the battery life since the radio transmitter uses a lot more power than the other microprocessor functions.<br /><br />Not long after having a new set of 4 Michelin Defender 90,000 mile tread warranty tires installed, at which time Discount TIre also installed the Orange sensors (no extra charge), the left rear tire was detected as having lost 10 pounds air (35 to 25 lbs) yet still enough air to safely drive at low speed to the tire service center nearby. This one event, saving damage to the new tire, could easily have paid for the Orange TPMS unit.
B000ARPVOI|4|I give this product 4 stars because it definetively did make a difference in my car but it didn't make it brand new again. My car is a 1996 Mercury Villager GS minivan with 224000 miles. Before using this product my car had a very rough and loud idle. It sound like a low pitched din in the cockpit. But after a full tank of this treatment the idle was less rough. Still a bit rough at times but way smoother than before. I guess it didn't completely change my car because the engine I imagine is probably very dirty. So after this I bought a product called Seafoam and poured it into a full tank of gas(2 days ago) and so far it seems to have made a way bigger difference than Lucas. So I suggest not wasting your time with this and going for Seafoam. This is still a effective product though.
B000IZ64X4|4|Good pads.  Relatively easy installation.  No squealing.
B00T0X61DS|1|Bad bad bad !  To big not the right cut I buy the box from the store and I intall it at the back glass off my pick up perfectly but this ones are a mess after they cut the paper its impossible to fix it and install it .
B000GUWLJC|5|nice set.  great price.
B005IHAPBY|5|as advertised
B004IYVJOA|5|Great just like factory ones
B00G25GOCA|5|Fantastic product.  Used on punctured pool filter hose and worked beautifully. Applied while hose was still wet.  Very easy and NO leaks even under pump pressure.  Ordered a second to have on hand for next leak and another to have in emergency kit for the boat.
B000I0QC72|5|very fast shipping, good price, good tool
B00496KFTW|5|good price/
B000WENDUS|4|Just like advertised. Fit was good on my two iZip bikes. Getting cover around the hitch was difficult. Will take two people to put cover on bikes.<br />Haven't driven yet, but I'm sure it will require additional straps to keep from billowing in wind behind the car.
B009DK2J70|1|Said it was for same car but doesn't have the same connector does work just have to make the universal plug fit
B007SNFENK|3|1 spray is all it takes and the whole room or car smells like real oranges and it instantly eliminates any smoke smell or odor. This should work for all odors, a 4oz can last 600 sprays. I highly recommend for all smokers. BUY NOW!  UPDATE: After a while without use, it will get stuck and not work. So now i have an almost full bottle of this spray that i cant use.
B00G6MLPQ4|3|Looks good! But they sent wrong one so had to do some cutting. That was not a big deal but it made no difference other than looks. The tip is painted with cheap paint that came off in first week . That's why only gets 3 stars from me.
B001AZW61K|5|Very well made and durable.
B000F285EG|5|good
B000C5FL84|5|Perfect match and fit for my 2002 Ford Ranger. Best part was I it passed emissions testing unlike my old cap which failed
B001UOULIQ|4|This a good product, however installation is tricky and instructions are non-existant. Also the beauty cover are hard to get in place.
B006B7YLX8|5|My 2014 Ford F150 sounds tough now.  Combine a V8 w/this CAI and you have a great sounding 4X4.  It really kicks in from 30 to 55 mph.
B00H26TQ4G|5|very pink
B000W0KTKY|5|Seems to do the job. Hopefully it doesn't...lock up...like others have complained about. May lube it up after a while to ensure that it doesn't happen. Unfortunately a little large to fit on the back disc (rear wheel spokes in the way), but fits easy enough on the front wheel. Hopefully this coupled with a cheap shock resistant alarm I found on Amazon will help deter thieves.
B000BQYH8Y|5|I don't have to get the front of my jacket wet anymore. I'm short so I had to lean against the side of my SUV to reach as far as I could and never could get the middle of the windshield cleared. Now, as just extend the telescopy handle
B005ZWM0R4|1|I could not figure out how to use it. A waste of money.
B005O31WMS|3|I purchased an I pilot new in april of 2011. I fish a lot and found that the gps operation of the unit reacts slower than I can control it manually. As a result the left and right arrow buttons on the remote get used the most. The rubber fabric on both have come a part and the unit is no longer water proof. I am going to take it to an authorized repair place or send it in to Minnkota. I know the motor has a two warranty but I am not sure on the remote.
B003I5AV3K|4|A significant upgrade from OEM pads when installed on a 2011 Sienna.  Much more &#34;bite&#34; when brakes are first applied (inspires confidence).  No significant increase in dust or noise.
B000HM579K|1|The threading got hot and snapped right off.
B0000AY3SR|3|This product reduced some of the yellowing and improved the light transmission of every lens I applied it to. Really far gone lenses will put up too much of a fight for this product, and it has not restored any lens I have tried it on to like-new condition.
B00065ZIJ2|5|This saved my car from being stolen just a few days after I received it!  The thief was able to get the vehicle started and tried to back it down my driveway, but had to abandon it because of the AUTOLOCK on the steering wheel.  So I very much recommend it!
B001AWU6KQ|5|Very well made product.  I got two for about the price of one of the more expensive brands.  The quality of these are just as good and I think they secure better than some of the more expensive brands.  I highly recommend and plan on buying another set for the rear.
B00353PWAW|5|High paint protection, your car bright and shine after use, I will buy it again
B008HO0I8A|5|Great, I've had it for long time and it is still perfect!!!!
B0091X2WAI|3|Instructions were worthless. I ordered these bars for my 2012 Tundra crew cab but the directions were for a 08-10 Tundra extended cab. I figured it out, but it took some trial and error and definitely another person. Plus, the hardware that mounts the bar to the brackets is gold. What sense does that make? So I assembled the bars on the truck and then disconnected the full assembly from the cab, brackets still attached so I could mask off the bolts and hit them with some spray paint. So far so good. 2 drive through car washes later they are still attached and everything is black.<br />I would recommend these, just know it will take you 3 times as long to install.
B000TYTSQO|2|i ordered this thinking it was the fuel filter cap like it says. its the oil filter cap so be careful when ordering
B000CB7DG6|5|Got my supply for 1 yr thanks
B00455D65C|5|So far so good, it's been about 8 months since installing on my bike. We shall see in the long run
B00EE9XZFU|5|Went on without a problem, fit perfectly for my bike, you need a chain riveter
B00FQHY64S|5|Great product
B0006IX87S|5|We have a Tower Garden, and it needs no chlorinated water.  I put it on the end of my hose, and makes it very easy to fill up my new Tower Garden! carolynswanger.towergarden
B0030YWM0Y|4|Excellent LOUD horns. Installed on my 2007 Jeep and it was a breeze. Finding a good place to mount them took longer than anything else. You can mount the included relay right where the stock horn was, and use the existing wiring for the horn and ground points on the relay. Then you'll need to run one 14GA wire from the battery to the relay, two from the relay to the horns, and then one ground from each horn to a grounding point.<br /><br />I docked one star because the horns don't come with any wiring and the included instructions are worthless. If you have no experience with automotive wiring, it might take you a minute to figure out how to run everything. If HELLA were to fix these two things they would get 5 stars all around.<br /><br />Oh, and a side note... If you are going to test these before installing be sure that they are far away from you and pointed away. When I tested them, they went off for all of about 1/10th of a second and I almost needed a change of clothes. My ears were ringing for about 30 minutes. It's not so deafening once installed.
B001GJ3EJS|3|it's ok.
B0002NIMGE|4|Holds up well, and since I like to change the color of my car pretty often the price is great.
B00IOBNR1G|3|Easy to install, but also easy to tear. The one on my driver side door is starting to rip.
B0093NAAY6|5|just as I ordered. Now I have to find the time to install it on the van. Coming soon to my hitch!!!!
B004N6RCLM|5|Good taillights well worth the money just make sure with the brake lightbulbs are in right so they won't.  make the housing get hot if ones bright and ones dimmer take the housing with the bright one and take out the bulb and rotate it 180 degrees they look good bolt right up and function great.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Great addition to the Battery Tender charger.  I use this for  Waverunners, and this extension allows much easier access to hook up the charger.
B00J8FH056|5|Good product. Great light output and easy to install. However for prelude type sh's need a resistor for the backup lights or you will get a code for the atts. The car won't recognize the less voltage used by LEDs.
B00G66KNZY|5|It is not just stylish and sleek, although I have to say that that's my favorite aspect of the helmet, but is also well-built as well. It was designed to ensure safety while driving and it'll really protect your head from serious injuries just in case.
B0015BN0QE|5|Great lightweight mesh and leather jacket. It does not come with a liner so you may want to get one size smaller unless you plan on layering. My experience with shopping, shipping and product description was excellent and I wold definitely recommend this product and seller!
B002MSVUZW|3|Looking at this suit it appears heavy-duty and would hold up to the wet weather.  However, under heavy rain my stomach still gets wet.  Great for light rain or as a wind blocker.
B005GYL8JC|5|Pros<br />Durable rubberized body.<br />Nice stainless steel bracket<br />Bright<br /><br />Con<br />The only think I didn't like about this light is the short cord.<br />Only 15\\" long
B004942LSM|5|Great value and price.  Fairly easy install.  Direct OEM fitment.  Corrected my P0128 code for 04' GMC Canyon.
B00CBZZSCC|5|The medal was as described. Same military quality.  Works well for replacing or duplicating medals.  Great product and very pleased
B004AQZUX2|2|One bulb worked great but the other one comes on and off so I had to put the old one back in
B006JVOYF6|5|My bf loves it. Got it as a b-day present. He's very happy. Thank you.
B004TRKBOK|4|Seems to be appropriate,  I bought them after the recent collapse of a section of the I-5 Bridge over the Skagit River.  Stores easily in the cars, close at hand.
B000COSAGA|5|Great product and good for Willy's truck
B000CMDA1C|1|Gorilla lug nuts use to be a quality lug nut.  Their product now doesn't seem to last. After 1 use(1 tightening), the locking lug nuts are already rusting.  I will not be purchasing them again.
B00H296WVS|5|A fun decal.
B008UOL72I|4|Ok product.
B008747EAA|5|Fits and for the price cant complain.
B0074DFJAW|5|These break when oil gets onto them. Replacing the timing belt and oil seal on my Kia, I needed this. Not too bad price wise, and good quality.
B001RLU0WE|5|Very good product as well as excellent service.
B0002MAILC|5|Great buy I
B004VFSLP6|5|I just got it today and is great. I put it to a good test by having it charge my laptop while playing a movie and surfing the internet at the same time. I did all that and still charged my battery in addition. The noise from the fan is not bad at all you hardly even hear it. I would highly recommend this product.
B00AW1AGP6|5|As advertised! Thanks!
B000LY5K4Q|4|I am not mechanically inept or anything. But I am by no means an expert mechanic. I found that the nerf rails were fairly easy to install. I Installed them in about an hour and a half. A lot of that time was just get familiar with the pieces and figuring out how to install them. The instructions are pretty clear. When you get down to it there are just 8 bolts to the whole project. Four body mount bolts and the four bolts that mount into the nerf rail. The nerf rails come wrapped up in a pink bubble rap and a clear bubble wrap. Those are suppose distinguish between drive and passenger side. No where in the instructions does it tell you that. I got both of mine unwrapped before I figured out they were different. I had to call  Westin to fine out. The pad goes toward the front. That was the only problem I had. Everything just had to be bolted together. I was happy with the purchase.
B001GH1PUU|5|Purchased this switch (and several others) to use to operate auxillary lighting I installed on my Jeep Wrangler.  They look nice mounted in a row on the panel and work very well.  Available in different colors to use with different devices.
B00HG2KVO0|4|I purchased these for my wife over a year ago and when we received them the color of the batman logo was blotched faded in certain spots. We decided to keep them and after a couple of weeks it was no longer visible due to the dirt from our shoes. The logo still remains but the color has more or less blended into a similar yellow. I've used my wife's car a lot, even to an from work so I've tracked a lot of junk on them and yet they still hold up great, durability wise.
B0024WNT00|5|Great fit
B000E2CVW4|5|Perfect.  Thanks!!!!
B00LNGT7AO|2|Very cute BUT all the flowers and  bugs came off first three days
B0094ECO20|5|nice fit
B00DD1SBNG|5|Quality Ducati Performance part. Simple and easy to install.
B0009OR94M|4|I used this to calibrate the Z-home for my 3d printer. It works really well, although the resolution/steps aren't super great... but it's good enough for setting up the first layer. I like the &#34;bend&#34; in it, so I'm not in an awkward position when I'm trying to gauge the nozzle to the print bed. My nozzle has a .35 aperture, so I try to calibrate it so that it's a little tough to measure with the .305mm gauge, but measures easily with the .254mm gauge so I can approximate the .28mm first layer height.
B0036E9VB6|5|THIS PRODUCT IS WELL MADE,LIGHT WEIGHT AND IS FAST!
B000NMDFNY|5|Awesome
B00FA4MW2A|5|love it
B001C5MEZ6|5|Fits over my head fine. There's more cloth than I expected, so I think it will be very
B004J32TBM|5|This alternator is the exact OEM replacement part  , so there is no complications. just bolt off and bolt on.
B002NDLEM0|5|This freshener smells so good!!I've used it in my car for years and I always get compliments.Don't be reluctant to give it a try,especially if you like citrus or fruit smells.
B0049MM63Y|4|Well, do not trust completely what front label says - the actual oil content is only 2 oz.(on the back of the can there is detailed description). The other 2 oz. is a refrigerant. So calculate accordingly. As for its application - I think it's working. I purchased oil with 134a for hybrids and my AC is working now.
B000WJA5ZY|5|Well built brings window mounted phone muck closer.  Very stable.
B005FXZRMI|1|This thing looks good and that's about it.  I could bend the flanges with my hands with some force.  Spend a bit more money on a nicer pan or else you will be doing later, after wasting it on this thing.
B00M39IXPA|5|AWESOME!!! If you know how to use your brain and a screw driver, then you can install this part yourself. Install time 15-20 minutes.
B006NK6TKG|4|I bought four of these for my trailer. Three of the four fit perfectly, the fourth would fit but was very difficult to insert into the S-track and to move around. I am not sure what the difference was. These hold well.
B0040CYTFQ|5|Factory clips as advertised.  Work excellent.
B001KOPFIW|5|This breaker is well made and does the job.  I recommend it.
B00375JBL4|5|works awesome and doesn't leave a mess.  just a warning do not get it wet, and if it does don't try to dry it off with a kleenex.
B00HFLG4Y8|5|Mounted several of these on my trucks as we converted to LED's on the rear... super bright, mount easily, basic hot/ground wiring....
B00ASHYFG0|5|Very happy with color and brightness. Well built. If they don't light up when you first install, turn it around LEDs are polarity sensitive. I have swapped out 6 cars with LEDs, saved lots of money not buying kits. Your auto's owners manual will list all the various bulb types and where your car uses them. Great upgrade.
B000C9CDRC|1|I didn't have any trouble installing the Control Module at all.  I got the part that I ordered and it was delivered with in a very reasonable amount of time. I put it in the car and it work as expected .........for less than a week and then all of the heater/AC lights started flashing and blinking.  Soon I was right back to where I started.  NO CLIMATE CONTROL! This thing looked new but must have been a rebuilt ACDelco Control Module that was improperly repaired.  I'm upset and disappointed with this purchase and will never purchase an electronic item again from Amazon.Com...
B00DQJB7EK|5|I ordered the 5&#34; Black Billet Antenna for my 2008 Silverado 2500HD. Once installed it looked great!, 100x better then OEM!, the radio was as clear as OEM also. Very Fast Shipping, I would highly recommend this item to anyone looking to ungrade there stock antenna!, and for under $20 you cant beat it.
B00OFRH18I|4|good product!
B0040IZXFK|4|It was great quality.  But the design could be a little better.  For a California license plate, this frame covers most of the Month and the Register stickers.  Not sure if that will create an issue.  Until then, it looks good on my car.
B006GDUPUU|1|The item did not fit right on my new car, and l hate it so much, I have to return it back.
B00GT64VRC|1|Flawed design, where end of the J pipe is just:<br />- way too short<br />- has smooth surface that clamp can't be secured on<br /><br />Why in the world they don't make it so it ends with proper fitting, or better yet, hose factory clamped on?<br />This thing will be buried in your engine. Do you want to risk this hose coming off and coolant going everywhere, when you are towing something 800 miles away from home?<br /><br />I returned it for full refund.
B003PJKC8S|5|The hitch was very easy to set in place.Bolted directly to frame It is very sturdy. I am completely satisfied.
B00192KZIA|5|I have attempted to find a spare tire cover to fit a 13&#34; tire to no avail even a 30 mile trip to Camper World proved non productive. This was convenient and delivery was fast. Thanks
B00CMFF1AA|5|Everything was shipped in a timely manner. Very satisfied with product
B001G64882|5|Does its job better than the original hood strut on my wife's VW Jetta. Fairly easy to install with only a screwdriver. Saved $50 that dealer would have charged.
B000WSF1ZY|1|This will not power my cordless drill battery charger. The charger draws only 95 watts and constantly go into error I will have to buy another brand I'll be sure to check these reviews before I buy again
B006ILUAU0|3|Had the key cut at the local hardware store.  It si working every time. The key seems stiff when inserting it in the switch or pulling it out. it seems that it is getting better as it is being used.
B000IY8OLU|5|I bought these to replace my original 92 Miata wires at 136,000 miles, due to the car sputtering every time I stepped on the gas. Installed in minutes with some electrode grease and they work like a charm, no more sputtering.  I'm currently looking to buy a second Miata due to their legendary reliability and every photo showing the engine has the trademark blue wires running from the plugs to the distro.  The wires are labeled in case you take off all four wires instead of removing and replacing one at a time and trying to guess the order, since they do have to be installed in a certain order... ;-)  A must-have replacement for Miata owners.
B00P2D3W0A|2|Not as bright as I expected. Not as red (kinda orange) as I expected. These are much better. Search for &#34;7443 16-SMD Cree Red LED Light Bulbs (Pack of 2)&#34;
B000C55L0M|5|Just bought 2 of them for my 1996 Toyota Camry and the price are a lot cheaper than some where else. The parts worked perfectly after the installation...and I would recommend them.
B0009IQZFM|4|This towel works pretty well.  I made the mistake of only getting one.....so lot's of wringing out to finish the drying of one car.
B000CEE62W|5|Good product!
B005SS9JT2|5|I bought this battery for my '09 Buell xb12ss Lightning Long - and it does a great job.<br />My old battery lost nearly the full power after standing for 1-2 month without charging.<br />This new battery hadn't any problem not being charged for a month alarm being active.
B00J53HGX2|5|Good quality and easy to apply.  I put one on my laptop and the other on my car.
B0002U1TYY|5|Since this product is designed to be used as a 3-Step system, along with the cleaner and carnuba wax, this review was also posted under the Step 1 and Step 3 products to help anyone who may miss one of the products...    I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983.  Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats \\"perch\\".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.      I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.     First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.      I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.    Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.    The only recommendation I would have is to buytwo bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.    The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.  You can save a few bucks on shipping to buy it that way.    Happy Waxin'... <><
B001GBR186|5|I ordered the BBK throttle body from Performance Parts Place and after I had ordered I just had realized that my throttle body would be shipped in 6-10 days, I try to canceled but Jon from Performance Parts Place just told me that I would get it in a week. I trusted him didn't canceled. I Received my throttle body in 3 days after I had ordered, I was impressed how fast it came to my door. I installed the BBK throttle body at the same day, The whistle from it is amazing, and I feel more power in my pony.<br />I recommend BBK throttle body and I recommend buy from this seller Jon really took good care of my order, I also ordered from them a Spec Aluminum Flywheel and Spec clutch, it came a week after I ordered. If you want to buy direct from this seller the site is ultrarev.com I bought direct from them a BBK ceramic short headers. The price is lower than where I used to buy.
B00KL7IASG|5|Excellent replacement!
B003LS2PW4|5|Better throttle response!
B00BTO0BGO|5|Retailers have these Xenon Headlight HID lamps at $100 each, but at $39.99 a pair, you can't beat the price!
B005XOP3OG|5|Awesome! My 2014 Charger R/T didn't come with the &#34;R/T&#34; emblem in the grill...just the Dodge one. This is perfect and shows off what my car truly is! Might be a little pricey, but it's bad a$$!
B000EDQR46|3|Won't hold a variety of sizes well, construction is fine, just didn't work well for my purpose.
B004KPU3OO|1|Be careful when filling out the order.  I must have made a mistake and got the wrong size so I had to pay shipping both ways.
B000XQ9MGE|4|After jumping friends four separate times a few winters ago, I decided that a safe way to jump others with no danger to draining my own battery was necessary--as a plus, I could jump myself (no need to stand on the side of the road with a sign!).<br /><br />I like to be prepared.  Although I sometimes go overboard on my preparedness, I like to think that I am usually just being practical.  I also try to get the best value for my dollar, and I eventually settled on this particular model after researching and reading reviews for a few days.  I have had this item for over a year, but only jumped someone just recently.<br /><br />One thing that made me choose this model was the 12v outlet feature.  I use my portable 12v tire inflator pretty frequently to top of my tires and I always disliked having to snake the cords all through the car's cabin to get to other tires.  Being able to just use the portable battery as a power source has been pretty nice.  That said, I do have qualms with the 12v port: it doesn't \\"hold\\" the plug.  I find that when I carry the inflator and battery from one tire to another and then set it down, I invariably have to reinsert the plug because it has come just loose enough to break the connection.  It is not an incredible problem, but it seems like something that would have been easy enough to do better.<br /><br />The light that comes with it is a nice feature.  I expected a bright LED, but instead got what appears to be a sort of dim incandescent bulb.  I have flashlights in my car and so I have not had to resort to using the flashlight in an emergency yet, but I imagine it could get the job done with some squinting.  Really, it acts more as a placeholder for when you're not using another 12v accessory and as a \\"make sure the 12v accessory button is off\\" reminder since the battery has no other indicator of when it is engaged.<br /><br />The unit is not overly heavy (I have absolutely no problem carrying it with one hand and I can't imagine anyone but the most fragile of people having serious trouble with it) but I wouldn't want to get whacked over the head with it.  So I suppose you could say being a self-defense tool is another feature.<br /><br />And now to the part that really matters: using it to jump a car.  I had the opportunity to jump an acquantence's vehicle yesterday and was a little anxious about it.  I hadn't charged the battery in a number of months and it had been sitting in my cold trunk since its last charge.  He had a 1992 V6 Toyota Tacoma and had left his lights on overnight.  Remembering the many reviews that I had read, I did not follow the directions of attaching the Negative clamp to a non-moving engine part and instead just clamped it to the battery.  On the first try, the engine turned over for about two seconds and then roared to life.  I was impressed that it worked with such little hassle.<br /><br />I went to charge the battery that night and it still read three out of three battery bars, meaning that it had not expended too much of its energy and could easily have gone a few more jumps without another charge.  That said, per the directions, I charged it up for a few hours and put it back in my trunk.  Apparently the little battery holds a charge quite well.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?  Yeah, I would, but I would probably search around for a similar model with a better 12v socket first.  If I couldn't find one, I would buy this again with no compunctions.  Would I recommend this to a friend?  Yes, with the 12v socket warning coming at the end of my sales pitch.  For its main intended purpose, jumping batteries, it seems to be more than capable and holds its charge for quite a while.
B000BQMZ60|5|These are the best I have ever owned.  They fit perfectly and so easy to install.  Love them.
B00OCYXTYY|1|Right out of the box I connected to my phone. But the two apps I use to connect to my car, including the one that's room mended for the device keeps giving error messages that it can't connect. I'm sending it back. They should make it Bluetooth enabled. Horrible! DONT BUY!!!
B00KRQM4EM|5|Love it! Got it quickly and ooh it looks great on the car!
B005F9LYLK|5|It was a simple swap for my broken hatch switch in my 2008 Pontiac Torrent. Took about 10 minutes total to do it myself.<br /><br />Took a while to be delivered for free shipping, but I'm pretty frugal and dealt with an unesable rear hatch for a week longer instead of paying for faster shipping.
B000OOQ9LQ|4|What do you want after all , It's a gasket. Went on easy. Holes matched perfectly and no leaks. Satisfied.
B0071MFL54|5|Anything would be better than what I had.  the car actually handles much better and instead of bottoming out it rides with the bumps now... great price
B001EZ5K4G|5|Very solid product, installation was very simple. Literally - it took me under ten minutes to install this hitch and get all the bolts torqued down.<br /><br />Pulled a U-Haul motorcycle trailer recently. No problems.
B002ZTNVDM|5|Great product at a great price, fit correctly and works like new, Thank you
B00EAJPV10|3|bought one for a spare. it appears to be of decent quality and since i&#34;m not analyzing my oil, I'm not qualified to comment further.
B000C9CC1E|5|fixed the ac and heat problem just like oe
B00GUJAL5Y|5|fit perfect on the Honda and looks great
B004HJJOZC|1|This piece of garbage doesnt seal for crap. if your going over 30mph you have a constant stream of air into your eyes. if your a rider you know that sucks. your eyes water and you will wipe out.

B0046QZXLU|5|THE SWITCH TOOK ABOUT A MONTH TO GET TO ME,BUT IT WORKS GREAT AND IM HAPPY.<br />ILL USE SWITCH DOCTOR AGAIN FOR MY OTHER SWITCHES THAT I NEED.
B000E3CYIY|3|slipery, Too dangerous to drive with this product. This is slippery and when you grab it, a lot of the times you are just grabbing and moving this cover instead of the actual steering wheel. So too dangerous to use on the road.
B004VKZFB4|5|thank you
B00AZJYDQI|5|Ingenious. Found this as a solution for airing up a large tractor tire with a pancake air compressor. The valve stem was never in a good location and the reach and the amount of time it took dictated a change in tactics. I locked this on and stood back in comfort. No more playing twister to hold on the chuck for five minutes.
B006IHXZZQ|1|I did not need the item because I got rid of the vehicle I tried to return and they won't take it, Im stuck with it.
B00QSNQ930|5|Very good quality - well made and has a nice weight. Definitely worth the money!
B003O8UTXI|5|At 1/5th the cost. I had looked at several online locations and found a huge discrepancy in the price they wanted. The highest was the OEM, so much for original parts.
B00F9K3JKO|5|A great addition to my window on my van. Applies easily and cleanly.
B00BSB24Q8|5|Work good
B000C5CEKC|3|I just picked up a 95 Jeep Wrangler, and there's really nothing to steal off this rig.  The most valuable thing on this thing is probably going to be the gas, as gas prices are hitting $4/gal again.<br /><br />The gas cap is... well, a gas cap, nothing fancy.  It's just like my F-150, just a twist until it clicks and you're done.<br /><br />This cap is an improvement over OE because it's got a lock and key(s), which is why anyone reading this is interested.  Well, this is what I've observed.<br /><br />It is not very straight forward as to how this thing works.  One would assume that once you twist the cap on, turn the key one way or the other to lock it, it would prevent the cap from spinning.  Wrong.  Well, if you think about the mechanics of it and take a look at it, there are no physical provisions to accomplish this.  So how this cap works is a little counter-intuitive.  When in the \\"unlocked\\" position, the cap is engaged with the threads.  In the \\"locked\\" position, the cap is disengaged with the threads.  What this means is when this product is unlocked, it will allow the user/owner to twist the cap on and off.  Once the cap is on, the user will \\"lock\\" the cap, disengaging the cap from the threads, making the cap (the user-interactive portion) spin freely.  This prevents anyone without the key from engaging the cap and twisting it open.<br /><br />I would assume this is really the only way to make a \\"generic\\" gas cap, that will work on most if not all vehicles.  The only other way I can see it working is with an internal camming mechanism which will create friction on the inside.  The issue with that is over time, twist on, twist off, the cam may eventually fatigue the metal and it stops working.  Well, this is not how this product works anyway...<br /><br />So back to this product, the plastic this is made of feels very cheap, not solid at all.  I can imagine over time, something will break and I'm afraid I would never be able to remove the cap, since, once in the locked position, it will spin indefinitely.  See the issue?<br /><br />But like I mentioned before, it's a much better cap than OE, if your gas (= hard earned money) is of any value, this is a pretty decent product.  Otherwise, you may want to keep an eye on this product and replace it when you feel it deteriorating.<br /><br />It does do it's job at capping the gas port closed and locking it, preventing would-be thieves... or they would be thieves anyway, or should I say, preventing you from being a victim.  So I give this product a 3-stars, since it does do what it was designed to do, but it could benefit from a better design or built more heavy-duty.
B00480J4I2|5|Fast shipping, awesome bulb. Can't beat it for the money.
B00C5RB03W|5|Very good fit and seem to work well. they stay in place and allow the bumper to vent
B000C15MUU|3|It is ok and does its job. However, as it is, it is a bit too thick. I like it a bit thinner and act more with a film like coverage. Right now it feels very tacky and does not consist a lubricating consistency.

B0041DY2II|4|I ordered this for my car it was a 2005 Chrysler Sebring front driver side window I wasn't sure it would fit, But it said it would so when I got it I checked it over real good it was almost Perfect. I did have to go out and buy two Metric bolts for it because the orginal parts are welded in place other then that it fit perfect, no problems. I got the bolts at Home depot so there not hard to get.
B0000WUM4C|5|Awesomely fun tool!!!!!!!!!!
B0013F8PZS|5|This shield is great. I have a 2014 Patriot and I love the look of the shield on it and not to mention it keeps the bug numbers down. I live in the country and when I leave town at night the bugs to my headlights only because there are no street lights. Since installing this the knats and other little bugs get wisked away up and over my windshield. I was having to wash my windshield almost daily because of them, but since I installed this I might have 4-6 bugs hit my windshield while driving 20 miles at night. The giant dragonfly that live around here are about the only ones that make it to the windshield. Don't listen to the other review that said 1 star. This is an authentic Mopar part with a Jeep emblem on the driver side. Buy this you wont be disappointed.
B00DWKZ39S|5|These are the best lights i have found yet. I use them on both of my vehicles and have had three other friends ask me to order them a set for thier trucks. Have not had any issues with mine and they have been on for about 8 months.
B00J52FPKE|3|The paint is great and provides a very good match but if you're not experienced with the clear coat technique watch out. You'll screw it up unless you do it just right. Guess that's why it's so expensive at a shop.
B001UC55VQ|4|Fits like original.  Too early to tell hoe it lasts.
B0049Z49HM|5|After amazon dropped the ball on yet another order I was forced to pick this up locally for more $$. Had more tension that both the junk from orielly and advance auto.
B009VGEEM4|4|The product arrived quickly and the grease tube was intact. The grease itself is a great product.
B0052FRVP0|5|Followed instruction from youtube and replaced 96 Camry driver side door handle; give it an hour to do the job.  You need this version with the trim piece, because you may very well break the existing one when taking it off.  Good item and fast shipping.
B0031XULDY|5|Simple to use.
B00140ZW1C|4|This device is undoubtedly effective. Fuel consumption has been reduced by one liter on 100 kms. I have attached 1 fuel saver to 2.0 engine.
B000WMO11K|5|best oil you can buy for your 2 stroke piston and rings love it dont by any other oil. Motul is good stuff.
B000COC8ZO|5|Wonderful produc
B008I62UE2|5|This trim was just like factory. Fit perfect. 25' was the right amount to do the four compartments on the camper. Looks really good.
B004LYRET6|5|Wish i would have bought 4 of these.  They work like you would think, seems real durable.  I was walking outside and needed to be seen as the days got darker earlier.  works well.  would buy again.
B00RW4N4E6|5|Product was easy to install, and was as specified. Arrived quickly.
B0024GW2XQ|5|It was good
