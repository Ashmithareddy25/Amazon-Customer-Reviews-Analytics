B003EVLG5A|5|Was just as advertised thank you
B007S2VFD4|5|Smooth cable works awesome
B00GTIHCAS|5|The part was received on time and works great.
B008IK7TSA|1|Poor quality
B00KZJQ2L2|5|This well made sunshade is perfect for a large windshield.  It is non-reflective silver on 1 side and black on the other, and folds-up easily and nicely into a small circular sleeve.
B00J58PP1C|5|just like expected ... well done!
B00BSGLBQW|5|Color is a lovely pale straw.  Warm and easy on the eye.  I use these in conjunction with cool white - they combination gives a good light for matching color, reading, etc.
B002IV8FHO|5|Item was exactly what I expected and as it was described. The item also shipped very quickly and without damage.
B001C9BZPC|1|Water pump failed after 15,000 miles and 15 months of use. Carried a 12 month/12,000 warranty. No water pump should fail after only 15,000 miles. This pump goes on 2003 Mitsubishi Outlander which requires removal and replacement of the timing belt to replace the water pump. Would not buy a Gates product again.
B0009V1WSE|4|I bought an extender for my 1 1/4 in hitch and needed to be able to lock the bike rack to my car, this was the perfect fix. Comes with three sized pins (I use the 1/2inch) and it works great
B000COTT1U|5|These worked great. The old air springs were leaking on my 1996 Towncar, and instead of replacing those I just put these in. It wasn't too hard, though I had to unbolt the rear shocks  so I could lower the axle in order to fit the springs, and that was with a spring compressor tool. You will need to rent one in order to do this job. O'Reillys Auto Parts rents tools out, it's free as long as you bring the tool back in less than 48 hours. It comes with instructions to turn off the Service Air Suspension light and rubber isolators, I used zip ties to sure them while installing. The ride is much stiffer with these compared to the air ride system, which I like. It's a much cheap alternative to replacing the air ride system, which have had many issues over the years.
B004UZDPY4|5|I ordered this from Amazon, and it was shipped on December 1, 2014.  Since then, I've used the bag on two occasions - once at the end of December, and once in June 2015.  As you can see from the attached pictures, the bag has not received harsh treatment.  But as you can also see, the zipper has already broken.  Unfortunately, the company's website says the bag has only a 90-day warranty.  Given the price of this product, I think I'm reasonable in expecting it was hold up far better than it has.  As I said, I've used the bag twice.<br /><br />I've contacted the company to see if they will stand behind their product.<br /><br />At this point, I can say the first time I used the bag it was great.  Did exactly what it claimed to do.  The second time, I used it the zipper broke.<br /><br />I will update this review once I hear from the company.  But at this point, there is no way I can recommend this product.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Within hours of posting my original review, I heard from the national sales manager of Tuff Truck Bag.  He promised to send me a new bag the next business day, and apologized for the failure of my original.  I am very happy to report that the new bag has arrived just as promised.  I think the promptness of his response and the speed with which I received the new bag speaks volumes about the quality and ethics of this company. I can strongly recommend this item and the company.
B00HF6QEC0|5|Perfect OEM color match for my fogs and no flicker or any issues at all. Good quality product!
B000EQCHCY|5|Great buy, fit easily
B00F2XI95S|2|Too small for key fob; had to return it
B00GJ1I6BE|5|Excellent
B000RT4AU0|4|Purchased this product to replace my old worn-out tools! Other than that, tools doing its job very well!
B00VNBDWPK|5|Bought this over HIDs, couldn't be happier. Great customer service when/if you have a question about the product.  Works as advertised, very bright without blinding other drivers on the road. I would recommend these to my friends.
B0002VAZ34|5|Delivered as promised and advertized.
B004BOPQ2S|5|Quality oil at a fair price. First oil change on my Scion FR-S went with out a hitch and the engine is well protected.
B00KJVORTK|5|Fantastic vinyl decal.  Used on a paddle to hang on the wall. Perfection!
B007ZSZAKK|4|Works well
B00JU3KMME|5|perfect
B000BTLXJM|2|Broke in less than 2 months - cheap product.
B001TYT020|3|so-so
B006NZTZLQ|5|My husband loves his new toy.  He is like a kid at Christmas. Thank you for an amazing product.
B00UI0QR4U|5|It can be a little difficult to get this to fit onto the engine the first time, but it is great for such an inexpensive exhaust header.
B00JNB406M|5|Installed in 5 minutes, looks great, and functions well!
B0024NSJWW|5|Made a big difference at night. Easy to change. Would buy again.
B00HO9MLGQ|5|Been having these for 3 months. Easy application and no problems.
B00BVOUP2C|5|OK
B00E9D4NES|4|Very easy to tear so be careful but other than that its good for the price.
B000F5ED44|4|Arrived on time and it works good. Use it to cut the copper tubing that collect for scraping. Little dull blades but works good.
B00M9IFVOQ|4|Works well
B007QW5KDW|5|What I was looking for. Fast service
B000NNONWK|5|Works great so far bought biggest size based on reviews and was a little big but does the job
B00NPPNKTU|5|Good light co
B00C4YKBOA|4|I purchased this product in April and so far have had no main complaints on it. I did read a some reviews where it did not last over 30 days, but mine has been doing great so far. Very nice to finally have AC!!
B004A66JMS|3|I would give these pads more stars but, they did not have the soft backing plates other quality brake pads have.
B00XDTP2GC|5|Nice little kit, and a nice test of small scale soldering. Mine worked great! You will need a battery pack. I got one that uses 3 AA batteries for total of 4.5v and has a on/off switch.
B000C9M6EM|5|Had a bit of play in the bearing of the old one, so purchased and installed this AC Delco Flanged Pully.  On my 2003 Grand Am with 3.4 V6, this is actually the pulley that fits on the belt tensioner.<br /><br />Loosened the serpatine belt, removed the belt tensioner, removed the bolt that holds the pulley on, installed the new pulley, and put it all back together.  10-15 minute job, works perfectly.<br /><br />Couple caveats for those doing this the first time.  Install it and tighten the pulley bolt down.  Make sure it spins freely.  For some reason, it looks to be exactly the same on both sides....but one side rubbed against the body of the belt tensioner.  So I reversed the pulley and it is free wheeling.  In my case I was able to re-install the dust guard and it didn't rub against the pulley, but the directions say in some instances you may need to remove the dust guard on the pulley bolt to make sure it's free wheeling.
B0001CMUV4|3|Hitch still wiggles some with the hitch tightener wrenched on. Great idea needs some tweaking.
B007P73UDK|5|The parts work well, the engine runs smoothly thank's
B0049L6O6A|5|Best rotors on the market, for the price.
B000O0B26W|5|Fitted perfectly in place of my broken one.
B00JPW2SV8|4|Installed on my 2nd Gen Tundra with a kc c50 light bar the design allows for quite a bit of forgiveness when using with other companies light bar altho I did have to expand the light mount hole 1 size it's a softer aluminum so it was really simple but do it right use a step drill the mount has plenty of flex without being flimsy it does put the light bar over the windshield but it doesn't obstruct view in any way you won't even see it when sitting in the vehicle only real complaint is the rivets needed to install are 1/4 &#34; rivets it came with 6 of them but good luck finding a gun that will shoot that rivet I installed using 4, 6 rivets worked just fine
B00NLULY9M|5|VERY VERY bright for my front park lights. My friends thought its a headlight at first sight. HAHA!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|One of the best buys on Amazon for the money!  I am using these as reverse lights on my 2000 F250's underneath side of the rear bumper.  The hardware included is good quality and the lights made of all metal housing are outstanding for the price.  The lights are very bright and aid my backup camera I installed.  You can't put a price on safety and these lights make it easy for anyone to hookup and install without a great deal of complication.  Thank you!  Here are 2 photo's of the lights.. OFF/ON If you look at the 2nd. picture you can see the standard vehicle reverse lights vs. the LED Work Light.
B001EOV492|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B002VFDBP8|5|What can I honestly say about a cabin filter? It works and it fit like the more expensive filter that I would have bought through the dealer. Fast shipping.
B0002SQU9K|3|Turns out it is too short for my pickup truck's calipers (Dodge Dakota, 2002).<br />To solve this problem. You might be better off getting a very large C clamp. Otherwise, if you have a flat piece of metal, or something spatcula-like in form (like a paint scraper) that won't bend, you can use this in conjunction with a piece of metal to push the calipers back. A solid strip of metal about one inch in width and about 5 inches in length should suffice. Other than that, works great!
B00B1ENJ7K|4|Great buy! although one of them so far had 1 out of the 5 LEDs on it dead but with all electronics having some sort of fail rating for the price I'm not too disappointed.
B00SZK26T0|5|I bought these light for my infiniti m37x and they look great and are very bright I bought simular light from ebay and they did not last a month so far these are great and would recommend to anyone, just order my 2nd set these bulbs last very long look greats and are very bright
B000E2CVT2|4|Its an oil filter, its in one piece and came with the orings, cant complain.
B000COC67E|5|Great addition to our shop! Very comfortable and exactly what we were looking for!
B006TZRAT4|3|Note that this does NOT work if your power steering is one that uses ATF instead of regular power steering fluid. I'm sure that it's a great product based on what I have read around the internet - but only if used in the right way (ask me how I know. :-)
B00EQMID84|5|Very good fit for my trailblazer 2004
B006H34BUY|3|not as good as expected.
B004A6BV0I|5|Exceptional quality brake pads.  Easy install, quiet positive stopping power.  Great price too.  Hopefully they will last at least as long as the original pads I changed out.
B005GMA9ZS|4|Feels great on your hands.
B008SOQOLE|4|Great product, fast shipping.
B0070Y35OC|4|When I first ordered this, they mixed up the tinting percentages, but were kind enough to send a new set.  Once the second set arrived, I installed it.  It was actually quite easy to install; I'm only 17 years old and I think I did a pretty good job. I recommend this to anyone who wants inexpensive tinting for their vehicle.
B00WFI0W2Q|4|So I know this review should be on the product and not have personal opinions but I have to vent.<br />I own two Subaru's and one blew a head gasket and upon searching on the web,  I came across an issue with Subaru's.  It appears there is a defect with the design of the engine on certain Subaru models.  So instead of a recall, Subaru decided to advise its customers to use the Coolant System Conditioner when they change the coolant.  By doing some reading it appears the conditioner is more of a sealant for the head gaskets, to help prolong their life.<br />You can research the issue on the web and draw your own conclusion on the issue.<br />I guess the product did its job. I will stay like others you really need to shake the bottle because it can't go in clumpy.
B00VKQ6ECQ|5|Works as described.  I sat in the driveway like an idiot watching netflix for half an hour.<br /><br />Thanks
B007A2PXXK|3|Used on dye from sticky note that got wet and bled on black, leather upholstery.  Removed only very little of the dye.
B002KAU6UC|4|Worked grate bolt right on happy camper
B001FDEAC0|5|Fit perfectly and works perfectly. It is nothing glamorous but my old one quit and this one fit right and and is working fine. It is a brand new unit and not a rebuilt though I personally feel there is nothing at all wrong with a good rebuilt starter.<br /><br />One thing a bit misleading about the photo is that this starter is not painted, it has a goldish coating. I would actually have preferred it be painted for cosmetic reasons but it has no effect on performance so I'm not going to take a star away.<br /><br />Lastly, I think it has been mentioned before but I'll repeat it, this part is made in Tiawan. I would have much preferred it be made in the U.S.A. but I knew before I ordered it where it was made. Being made in Tiawan may not be bad or good but I think people should at least know and so they can make informed decisions.
B00IKSRTBM|5|Easy install, cheaper than prewired kit.  Worked On Rola hitch hauler.
B0074BNX1G|3|I have my headlights but one of them has broke where the screw goes
B0021Z5WAA|5|Don't ever use anything else! It's just that simple. I was blown away. What is really amazing is the shine that shows under the dirt AND the way it holds the gloss on my 2000 Blue BMW 5 series. Purchasing Driven's full line at the San Deigo County Fair this 2015, I followed the instructions to a tee starting with removing the old wax with simple green, applying Finish Restorer progressing using the wash.  After applying two initial POLISH coats I was amazed at the clarity.<br />You name the polish, Ive probably used it-Turtle Wax-Meguiers Nano-Astro Shield (years ago) Zymol. Nothing works better or is easier to use.<br />Its been a month now since the Fair and I wash my car weekends with Driven's wash that does not degrade the shine. Now I use the Quick Spray after each wash and the compliments keep coming.  Will I use anything else ever? NEVER.
B002OAXGHI|4|Was a great bag and fit a lot of stuff without looking too obtrusive on my ninja 500. Right up until it flew off on the highway. Luckily it was empty. Probably user error and I didn't attach it tight enough, so be careful when you do.
B008IAJPSW|5|Great product !! Easy to install.. Adds a great look for a good price .. Quality of material is good and very easy to install took me no longer than 20 minutes by myself ..
B00D8YMJM2|4|Put on my car in November of 2014, they improved the ride quality of 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS.
B004ULN610|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B00VNJ4PEO|4|Fits resonably well on my 2000 Chevy Venture Van. Comes with numerous pieces to fit in hard plastic..
B002MYLB1Y|5|Arrived promptly. They work great for creating new places to bungy cord things to my motorcycle and no hooks scratching the painted surfaces.
B00LIXQLPG|5|Showed up fast and works great
B00ABYVT64|5|really heavy material.  use to squirt water on puppy.  he hates it and has eaten many but not these.
B00UCOBYB8|5|Real nice
B004HPSI6M|3|The cord is a bit on the short side.  Other than that its fine.
B00NQ8GBME|5|A+
B0071XQ4V8|5|Very good hitch. Very heavy for an old man but does an excellent job.
B00MP5RF0Q|5|Wife loves this.
B007ZFSMYY|5|Looks great on the truck.
B0036QYCJK|5|Bought as a gift and it was everything I expected it to be. My boyfriend loved his body armor, super easy to install, fits perfect, and it looks great too. Well worth what I paid for it!
B0006O2SAK|5|Very easy to use.
B004ME11FS|4|good price. its a hose,
B005XPBJC0|5|Was a great looking, easy to install replacement for my rearview mirror that got sideswiped off. I am NOT a &#34;car guy&#34; and installed this with ease.
B00MJC7JQ0|5|Very nice grips
B00ID1FW7O|4|Easy to install and sounds great... just needs to be able to control Bluetooth from speaker control.. maybe a lil more bass
B0045JD5Q8|5|Awesome design perfect fit 2002 Volvo v70 xc
B009OBW23O|5|works well
B00IZNQH4W|5|just what I was looking for.
B001Y91H3K|5|Great product. Fits perfectly as described. I received my item with a little fold mark. Its not a big deal but I wish the item was packed better or had &#34;fragile&#34; marking.
B000HRZ0WO|5|Sturdy and fits just right for my Honda Reflex 250cc scooter.
B003NBFMMY|4|I bought this rainproof bag knowing it will probably never be tested for that (in AZ in almost never rains where we live). Sure enough, during the trip we went on it rained on us, and not just a little! Everything came out of the bag dry, to my great relief. It was roomy (we fit 6 huge sleeping bags and various people's backpack sized bags filled with clothing and other items into it with room to spare). I am very impressed. The quality is something that will stand up to many uses and when we came home we emptied it, navy-rolled it up into something the size of a sleeping bag roll and put it away in the closet. This bag is not for a smaller car, check your measurements before you buy as it is really long.
B000E0ZFLA|5|Quality hose, Killer price and fast shipping!
B000JWPRJI|5|It fit fine,no installation problems! Excellent service.
B00LXEQ7EK|5|Nice tag. Throwback to the old logo and not too flashy.
B00TZF06VO|5|Well pleased, thank you.
B006H34AC8|5|I bought this when my city said we could no longer wash our cars due to the drought in California.  It has worked so well that I'm wondering why I ever used soap and water.  Even when this drought is over I will continue to use this product.  I can clean my car in minutes.  The only thing I would add is that I still use a microfiber cloth to clean my car windows.
B00EXGEBQG|5|Good price!
B00A93SDO8|5|Great frame, looks better than pictures!  Very happy :)
B00Y3PO5BS|5|They look great on my truck ..
B00ANZHG7C|3|Not so absorptive.
B003E26FW8|1|Double the price of Wagner and still squeaks. I've used it for 2 months now and am not satisfied.
B005H7DRQA|5|Great value
B003YLH942|5|Worked exactly as expected been going for about two months now. If this goes and you haven't replaced your comfort blower as well I recommend it for the extra money. As its possible the blower fried this component.
B0034ZNZSM|5|Great
B00S0W6BIK|4|Easy to install
B0004ELKC4|5|Worked as advertised. Will be buying more as it brought back the original black of my Wrangler soft top
B00SSSAYKC|5|Fits the vehicle as described.
B007KZY7BG|3|Shirt was VERY small.
B0052FREAC|3|Fit vehicle perfectly with one exception: had to be modified to fit door-handle sensor. Swapping hardware from old handle to new handle surprisingly more work than you'd guess. Looks beautiful and works perfectly on the vehicle, just be forewarned that the replacement will take you longer to install than you originally planned on.
B007PJM2F0|5|worked great on my 150cc scooter
B00MIZT7OK|5|Fit fingers perfectly !  Goes thru TSA. Plastic & attaches to outside of my purse!
B00062YP62|5|Fit right on my corvette 1990 L98 engine.
B00SZK1NKI|5|Worked perfectly !
B00DX8960G|1|i had to return it. specs online were not clear.<br />the display does not mean much, it does not display correctly when being used.<br />It arrived displaying full charged, but according to my very advanced charger, it needed a lot of time to charge.<br />I then used it with an LED light.  This battery did not last 20% of what I was expecting based on the volume( size ) of battery.<br /><br />I returned it,  and got another brand that has the capacity in Lithium Ion that I was expecting based on the battery size.
B00V5ZX1KK|1|it doesn't fit my 2016 KIA sorento
B00FB3KZHY|1|They did not work after the first day I got them
B00TQ07IOQ|5|What a deal! :)
B0002SRJCC|4|Nice oil can. If you own a diesel truck like I do. You can safe a lot of money buying 5 gal cans. Fill it up with 4 quarts. Pour in 4 more  and your done..  No spills safe all the plastic bottles
B001G4Z5J0|5|Very sturdy!! Well made. Very large. Allowed my family of 7 to vacation and bring everything we needed with us
B00DOOY91K|5|Perfect fit, no more stick holding up hatch!
B00EAJG6FK|5|The best thing you can add to your car short of adding a BIG TURBO. Massive difference.
B00C4VUWC4|4|good
B003IS3HV0|5|Makes my leather recliner so nice;  plus waterproof.  Thanks
B00XQCQ0XA|5|Great Hugo Boss sticker! I love it!
B00HE66OIU|5|Came on time and was the exact color
B00B4KTI5I|5|It fit  just a few adjustment and it worked perfect. Took me longer to pull the panel and accesories off then to install regulator. Make sure you order the correct regulator for the auto window position and you should have no issues came packed great.  I am stingy on my 5 stars fyi so if you have a 2006 yukon Denali RRP door regulator out of order this the correct one to order. Day one today my kids will put this to the test
B000CMJSKE|4|Did not take long to install should have come with a new boot.
B001H2XN1I|1|Size not accurate
B00NBH6814|3|The light, even with 9 SMD LED, is kind of dim.  The reason I order these is because of hoping for brighter light.<br />I round up having to revert back to the 3 LED light.
B0094B5E66|4|Easy to install. It's not stiff. But it looks good.
B003OBPUAW|3|Wipers make clicking noise.I had to push the blade back in twice in 3 months. Cheaper than AutoZone.
B000CMH7JI|5|Awesome piece!!<br />I have it 2 years now and it still looks awesome!!
B00TEAW5DM|5|Totally worth the money. No more stuttering or bogging down
B000B8YDUO|5|i love this stuff
B008GZUECU|3|A little snug behind my ears, and pulls/snags my hair when removing them.  Love the view threw them.
B00029WR78|5|Great upgrade,  all transmissions should have one
B001WX4E74|5|makes detailing a breeze
B000C1KJ76|5|I was in need of a fuel pump for a 1999 Astro van and Airtex was the answer. Lower cost than Delco and others, but the quality is just as good. I've installed Airtex many times and I now look for an Airtex fuel pump assembly any time I need a replacement pump. Why take a chance on a reman unit when for and extra 10-15 dollars you get a new unit. Comes with new gasket and harness and wire crimps. You might want to get a couple of new line connectors from Dorman prior to installation for the lines connecting to the pump. The little retaining clips that install on the inside of the female ends. The old ones might be just fine, but for a few bucks why take the chance of having to do it again due to a leaking line connection. This came with the updated harness connector. GM changed the connector for some reason. Sooo if you buy another brand that doesn't come with the harness connector you won't have a good time trying to install a new or reman pump. Thanks Airtex and amazon for service and Goods!
B003UNEVWM|5|These are perfect as soon as I installed them my self witch is not very hard by the way. complete silence...my old bands were driving me crazy ...2005 350z
B00L844RX8|2|bulbs I received are different than pictured,the adjuster is on the side and after they are installed there in no access  very poor design,
B001G8AIMU|1|Arrived and did charge our item. However after the second day of use the contact leads on the ends simply fell apart from use. Maybe the trash can will have better results.
B004BI5692|4|Very pretty but kind of hard to figure out installation.  Never did quite get it to 'Click' in the way it was supposed to.
B001P4I7BE|5|Great bars. Excellent chrome job and beefy. 12.5 inch works on 2014 and up batwing Harleys with no cable change.
B00IKSM42Q|5|COOL
B00DX87YCS|5|SUPER
B008L0FSJY|5|This installation of this exhaust is pretty simply. If you have an older vehicle as I did in my case be prepared to cut off the preexisting bolts for installation. This exhaust for one is decently loud. So if you want a quiet ride stay away from this. Cruising with this on the highway around 4000rpm is surprisingly the only time this exhaust is quiet but any slamming on the gas pedal or high revving and you will hear the loud 'groaning'.
B007OW6MD6|5|like it
B00IACGFOA|5|Very pleased with this item.  It does what it says. And the shipping was lightening fast.
B003VDX5D2|2|Not as good as it could be . But nice and handy , fast
B002QYDD3O|2|Smells great for about 4-5 days but in less than a week the scent is almost completely gone.
B001OZS7G4|3|cheap in price rattles like crazy with tire on carrier
B005QE7EPY|5|Love it! Thick material.
B002OAT8DE|5|It works great on a 2004 sportsman 500..since it is much higher than factory recievers.  I made an adjustable hitch to accommodate different trailer heights. ..it took about an hour to install since  machine had allot of dirt and some rust to clean up. .no problem installing, everything fit fine. .
B00IQNMVWS|3|Ok
B000ECGZ5I|5|Great
B004F8U7SS|4|just change engine works great
B00M3ILR5Y|1|Looked just like the pic. Had them put on by a tire shop just to be sure and they fell off while going about 15mph into a grocery store parking lot. Didn't know until a nice man stopped to tell us it rolled over a hill. It was very embarrassing and a complete waste of money. I only gave it one star because I had to. I had already requested to return them and got the email and then lost everything to a house fire and the company basically could care less. I hope their life stays happy and without any difficult times.
B000Q0R4V2|4|fel-pro makes very good products.
B000SL4AA2|1|The second time the air compressor was used,  the cigarette lighter plug-in came apart when it was removed from the socket.  The cap on the plug-in, that holds the spring loaded center contact ,sheared off  internally so the center contact no longer makes contact with the lighter socket, rendering the air compressor useless.  And just when I was going to order another one for my daughter's birthday present.
B00BN474SS|5|great
B007VRF6WM|5|perfit for what i needed it for
B00NTIV45A|1|Did not work for my application reordered right one.
B0041U6MLQ|4|Fit good, 08
B004LQCIR2|5|I am very happy with these  headlight lenses.  The light pattern is perfect and the other drivers don't flash me. Service was timely, product installed effortlessly.
B000CINVA6|4|I really like this grease. The only thing is it's supposed to have the straw for the nozzle but wasn't there but the tape that holds it on was.
B001ENQ44I|5|Easy install with the scanning stuck reverse and turn signal led lights.<br />Has lasted for almost 1 year and still works great
B003FKTX4G|5|Quick install. Happy I got it!
B00ZOKJVAG|5|pretty good
B00E5KGQFY|4|Compact size, hasn't faded any and it's been through the Las Vegas summer heat/monsoon season.  Part of me wishes it was on a clear background, but then it'd be harder to see, unless the printed part was light colors.  Maybe it could work?
B00VU9ECRW|1|1997 honda accord 2.2l value package. this radiator shipped and arrived as promised. when attempting to install it, the transmission line fittings were reversed and the fan bolt holes didnt line up. the radiator was also about an inch too tall so it wouldnt physically fit in my car. attempting to return this part now.
B001QV2SAW|5|Part was exactly what I needed
B00IKPRMD0|4|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.  Color slightly off from pic and original color, but not outlandishly so.
B00GTGU554|5|The best bang for you buck you can get for your f150. It made me get puddle lights to be all led. It's a clean modern look. No yellow incadescents!
B011Q18D14|5|My husband told me to get this scanner tool coz he was curious about what's going on in our car, so when we got it he tried and tested it. It works really well, although he had a hard time finding the port to put the scanner in but he never had a hard time using this scanner tool. This tool is incredibly useful since my husband is very curious about the status of our vehicle and he wants to know what's going wrong with it. It is a useful way to determine the issues with our car without having to take it in to a dealership or a mechanic for an expensive analysis. It is just better to know what's wrong with your car before hand rather than rushing to bring it to a mechanic. Using this saves a lot of money. Overall my husband is pretty satisfied and contented with his new car scanner tool. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.
B007FGR852|4|You get what you pay for, I ended up drill a hole the the bottom of the fairing and used two zip ties to connect it too the light. With some bending of the bracket and elbow grease it looks awesome on my 98 sporty 1200 just take your time and don't get pissed off.
B00G6UG89K|2|I ordered 2 packages of these. They shipped both in separate packages that arrived 2 days apart and the first arrived no problem. The second arrived in a nice outer heavy duty clean envelope, after opening I found an old previously opened package with 1 of the 2 items missing. The container inside was obviously opened and it also had a sticker on the back of it with penciled in writing showing $22.00. I have to send this back now in hoped to get what I paid for.
B002OAQDBE|4|Overall it looks great and works great, took it on a long trip out west and it protected my towed vehicle behind the motorhome. It is  pretty heavy to install, but the weight also keeps it in place as you drive. I would recommend it to other motorhome owners looking for this kind of protection. The reflectors seem a little on the cheap side, but so far have stayed on.
B0018YGATC|4|Great value for doing your own brake job. These are smooth and quiet. They've been on the car for less than six months so we do not know about longevity yet but there hasn't been anything to lead us to believe that there will be a problem.<br /><br />Tip: Try your local recycling center to get rid of the old rotors. That is how we took care of ours.
B0015PI7A4|3|Too much navigation for a simple command. I'm sure it's a good product though. Returned.
B00ATXEPQI|5|great product! it has also the fusible and silcense sound!
B00496LXJ8|5|quick shipping, they work as described
B000CITKCE|1|work great for 2 months the died
B001539BCE|5|Great product.
B00TIHJ20A|5|Great product, but a bit tough to shut off down at the front wheel. I use it to lock the disk brake. You do have to be careful to unlock it without setting off the alarm. It does allow for slight motion. If it rings, it stops fairly fast. Low cost, great preventative....I lived in a big city for many years.<br />This low cost option could work for you!<br /><br />Love it,<br />E.
B00OBU3RT6|5|This item fit and worked as expected. Was delivered quickly.
B00JAO5L88|5|Very nice!!!
B00EC8Y4FI|4|I bought these headlights to replace the old OEM foggy lights on my 96 sierra k1500. They needed a slight amount of modification to fit, but it wasn't anything major or noticeable. I paired these with a set of wagner 9005/9006 bulbs i bought on amazon and i can see much farther now in the dark. Overall a fairly good product.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|I use it to secure my bicycle, moped, and out gate.<br /><br />We have yet to see it fail and it has been abused in all sorts of weather.<br /><br />Recommended for moped riders especially those living in Hawaii because of the high moped theft here.<br /><br />Excellent product and reasonably priced.
B00REGXU64|1|yes you get 10 of them witch is nice, except they don't work. the hole in the tip is machined completely. there extremely poorly made. wasted my money on this.
B00XC3EE7C|1|$100 for a piece of plastic that costs more than the rim? TF?
B00ARJQSLE|1|Just got this part last month, and my car has been idling rough again and at very love rpms. Tonight I was checking to see why and when I wiggled the connections from the air box to the throttle body it would start idling better. I then went to wiggle the intake boot and noticed that there was a big gapping hole that my thumb had easily went through. My though was that this product would last a whole lot longer than one month, considering the the original part lasted a good 17 years. If you are considering buying this part, I would advise spending a little more for a better quality product.
B00E5P180M|4|Can't beat the value of this cargo mat.  Quality is pretty good, might not be thick rubber like some Toyota OEM all weather floor mats but it is pretty durable for the price.  I took away one star for a huge caveat...this thing stinks like a tire shop.  I'm washing it, airing it out for a few days, and spraying it down with frebreeze before I permanently leave it in my car.  Hopefully the smell goes away or else I'll have to reduce the stars on this review.
B00GTHJF5E|5|Great price on a high quality part.  Used on my 1986 ford ranger with 2.9 V6.  Auto transmission. Corrects fluctuating rough idle
B00JDR4DRW|3|Not noticeably brighter than a standard 194 bulb.
B00NP60URE|5|made bleeding easier.
B004UAM33I|5|Great kit, great price
B00L9HKMK6|2|They didn't fix my 2013 Toyota Prius factory 15&#34; rims.
B0049DYN02|1|Very poorly made.  Had plastic pieces inside oil inlet.  If not noticed could have caused a problem.  Never installed.
B004K7ZG58|5|This was the correct part for my 2005 nissan pathfinder, however, my stock suspension setup looked different. This one is only the outside coil spring insulator whereas my factory setup has the outer insulator with a built in inner bushing. My bushing was worn out and when I ordered this part, I didn't know Nissan changed out my design mid-year. I ended up returning this one and buying the OEM style from my local auto parts store for about the same price.<br /><br />I have no doubt in my mind that this will work flawlessly for anybody with a 2005+ Nissan pathfinder.
B006V7TG42|5|just like the originals.
B0036ULEV0|1|Junk
B004W97QPC|5|Great fit and they look awesome.
B001KO6D5Q|1|Disappointed. It's cheap plastic painted silver not real metal chrome.
B007OW6I12|4|Toyota changed cap design mid year. I need the 2010 version for my 2009 Prius. My cap has threads, the 2004 to 2009 Prii has notches. A larger photo of cap's inside would be helpful.
B000CQOIVO|5|Another excellent REESE product.
B0093XLGVM|1|these are a joke don't waste your money they came in a cheap bag in the mail. tried both bulbs in my bike and nothing.
B0067UFHF0|5|Good quality and price
B008HZOZ5G|5|Since putting these pads on, I haven't heard a squeak! Quality pads for a reasonable price.
B000ZRW78Q|3|Instructions are very general and hard to follow. Using it for my kids power wheels 12v vehicle as a remote kill switch if she gets too far ahead of me. I had to go online to a power wheels forum to find wiring diagrams for similar units.
B000KTKSEE|3|Forced fit on a 2005 4Runner; not an easy install.
B000EQ816U|5|A few weeks back I had to bring my car in for an oil change and I was told that the sway bar link on the front passenger side was broken. My car, a 2004 Acura TSX, has 125,000+ miles on it so it looks like general wear and tear were the culprit. I was quoted over $250 for the repair so I decided to look elsewhere but after getting a similar or higher estimate from 2 other places I decided to purchase this Moog part along with the same piece for front driver side (might as well replace both so I know they are both new and working properly). I brought the car back to my parent's house (I can't do repairs on my car where I live as I park in a large parking lot) and got to work on the replacing both sway bar links. The toughest part was getting the old parts off as the one was broken and the other looked like it was about to fail so getting a good grip on both was tough. Also, the OEM part required a allen key but the hole had become rusted and it proved to be quite difficult to remove. Once both parts were removed the actual install of the new pieces took no time at all (much better design than the OEM parts, not allen key needed). The install took some time but in the end I saved a couple hundred dollars and the parts are working great.
B00KWDR3JQ|5|Fits Lexus ES330 2004 perfectly! No complaints!
B006WCOG5A|5|EZ install. Added upgraded wire harness. Great upgrade for my jeep cherokee xj.
B000PAM9KO|5|Excellent product. I will buy again.
B004GCGYBC|5|Easy ordering and very fast delivery, product fit like a glove, couldn't ask for anything more. Thank You so very much!
B0049LPII0|5|Excellent air cabin filter. Fit perfectly in my Lexus LS460. a good amount of charcoal. I drove behind a truck that started smoking black smoke, with my air on recycle i did not smell a thing. Highly recommended!
B00DSD4RKU|5|Minnie Mouse is on my camper. Installed very quickly and easily. Looks fantastic. i recommend this decal to anyone.
B00D9C2CDO|5|We ordered this and used it for two different trips within the first two weeks of having it. It easy to use and worked great. We have four  boys 5 and under, that is a lot of stuff to pack and there just would not have been enough room in our van.
B00SIQH8A8|5|If you have kids with two or more cars in a garage this is a quick easy way to protect the doors from getting hit from careless damage from other doors or objects knocking into the car. The design is pretty simple there is a foam piece or section that you cut to size and two strips of magnet tape that stick to the foam for placement on the car. The magnets are strong enough to stay on the car without damaging the paint. I have actually forgotten to take the foam off when I drove the car a couple of times at highway speeds and the foam stayed on the car. I only wish I bought this a few years ago before the original damage was done. I bought these to protect our new car more so than the car these are sitting on. If you are paranoid about parking in a parking lot these will work too, so long as someone doesn't steal them off your car.
B001CAW2DK|5|Always buy for my outboard Yamaha 150.  Great price also
B009DJSIHG|5|They are just what we wanted and arrived on time.
B001V8U12M|5|Handy and dedicated to a purpose. I use it with a battery powered drill to set up my camper scissor stabilizing jacks.
B008FCDTK8|5|Great product for keeping scratches off my favorite vehicle
B0034CYPSO|5|ARB rulz
B001W6LGGS|5|it is a greatproduct.
B009PCR67Y|5|Incredible value for the money.  I wish it had a SNELL rating rather than just DOT, but that can not really be expected for this price point.  There is some buffeting but nothing that is unbearable especially for the price.  Very happy with the helmet for the price.
B002EE6LLW|5|Nice clean decal with sharp detailed lettering,I haven't applied it yet. It is an attractive looking sticker it's going on my RV along with the state park stickers with the same oval shape as this sticker.i know it will look great!
B00FGXEAW0|2|The Positive side is the lights are much brighter than the stock lights.<br />The Negatives are, the plastic is thin and feels cheap, you need a second set of hands for installation, caused hyper flashing turn signals so you then need to purchase the relay at $25 plus shipping to solve this problem.<br />Not sure it was worth it.
B000BQSZNC|2|We have had to replace this 3 times now.  As far as we can tell, Camco is the only company that sells these.  We resorted to Amazon in the hopes of being able to get something of better quality...no luck.  We love camping so I guess we will just keep buying them.  This company is making a killing on these things.
B002DPHERW|4|This was a replacement for one that snapped and have not had it long so time time will tell
B004GE6KEQ|3|This is okay product, while it fits my 2010 Camry, mechanic told me it may not last longer and had some issues with hole matching hole. Its on right now and looks good...
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great!
B000BPSW7C|5|love it
B000FOIJXQ|4|This stuff works great. It doesn't wash off and seems like it will last a long while.
B000C5GAQQ|5|awesome
B000C2CAUO|5|Got these for a 2000 Jimmy I bought recently. Fitment was perfect and so far everything is holding up just fine.
B00G4CN3F2|5|Worked like a champ!
B008FXN5B0|5|a perfect fit for the Coleman Mach 8 a/c
B00BA8QCG2|5|It was bought for my husbands Porsche Targa 4S.  He loves it!  He loved it so much that he showed a neighbor who also owns a Porsche and he just bought one!
B00NI1L9P8|5|Easy to install.  Perfect
B00E9FS60S|5|I broke my antenna. This one arrived on time and fixed the problem.
B00429NKWK|5|Tried other products that did not work.....this made the headlights look like new
B003VL3U2K|4|I like shorter about 220 mm instead 270 mm. However the item is good..  That help
B0031G4R90|5|So far working great
B00K0QRS7M|5|Perfect to extend beyond rear mounted spare tire. Very robust
B011BM5PZA|1|Cheaply made.  Suction cup detached from plastic base during the first use.
B00KY2VFD0|5|Use these for straining autobody paint prior to spraying. They work well and result in reduced trash in the finish. Will definitely re-order when I run out.
B006P1HPNS|4|Good price and good quality, fast delivery.  Would have given it 5-stars, but 1 of the bearing seal caps (out of 4 I bought) was dented pretty bad in shipping/packaging.  Also, there is no cotter pin or castle nut included.  The castle nut isn't such a big deal but the cotter pin is a cheap item and I'd gladly pay another buck or two if it was included for peace of mind.
B00LNIPBH0|3|These were good until the back ones ripped and when I got them they didn't even come with the steering wheel cover not the shoulder pads
B0016HUSVC|5|not acurate on size it think
B002EBSLA4|5|Very good price
B0074EM1AC|4|Very good mats.  Very good value.  Shipping time was awesome too.  Arrived in 4 days from ordering them online.
B001TXWNLQ|1|Did not work AT ALL. Luckily I only paid $3. Waste of time and money.
B00I2I104C|3|Not as bright as it said it would be on the description.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Great so far!  Looks like great quality
B001DCJ3L6|2|Easy to install, but the arms are too stiff and make it difficult to close.  Because they are too stiff my liftgate opener pulls shut assuming there is tension on the gate.
B002UC6PY6|5|nice
B006WPQNB2|5|I selected this model for emergencies while on the road and for camping. It's slim, compact, full height, light weight & easy to assemble/breakdown ! If like me & you have a conversion van, where space is limited, this fits the bill perfectly. Get the optional mounting plate to keep it securely in place.
B000O5I73I|5|Ordered open box only had a couple scratches fit my truck perfectly one hour to install including wiring and harness
B006GVL934|5|Works great cds don't slide out.
B00OJ2CVFC|5|Daughter in law loves this decal.
B001P29O5Y|4|Good overall equipment. No lock provided, so this is like taping a $100.00 bill to your car, going on a bike ride and expecting the bill to be there when you get back. I searched all over town for a lock that would work with the end of the threaded hitch bolt, nothing worked while many came close. I had to drill an extra hole in the bottom tube to accept a separate 5/8&#34; diameter hitch lock. A true PIA, missed a bike ride, burned up a day looking and drilling and shopping. The rack is fine but the Velcro seems flimsy and I have to use 3 bungee cords to hold the bike in place.
B007FF5VAC|2|I have not been able to program these, yet.  I had another remote that worked but the key ring part was broken.  I just swapped out the guts of one of these new ones with the old. If I can get these programmed, I'll change my review.
B00IEYDSHQ|5|These are standard trailer rims and tires, direct replacement for factory equipment. I was able to get 2 rims and 2 tires for the same price as big box store that sells tractor supplies wants for one.  Excellent deal .
B000CJLK08|5|ok
B000GU5IUQ|5|Great for price
B003IOKPLO|5|Easy to use. Have cleared codes on my 2004 Chevy Suburban.
B001DKV5H8|5|love it....  trans had a rough shift and after treating with prolong now shifts smooth again.
B0055PD1H4|4|It works pretty good just don't get on painted surface cant get it off very easy.
B000C427MI|4|NICE FILTER.
B006M6HUU4|5|Good chain
B00RJNE7UA|5|It is just what I wanted.
B00SG1G720|5|Great sticker, great size and design.  Looks great on my truck.
B000E4SNXS|3|Good value for the money, however I was very concerned with the screws which were supplied,  they appeared not to be the correct fit. I did not try to force these screws into the respective holes and I looked for some thing else which seemed to fit perfectly. I was a little disappointed to say the least.
B004IZ0N82|3|Took a long time to get to me and was the wrong axle. I double checked the my garage and entered in the correct model, trim, engine and transmission and it said it would fit. Nope. To be fair tho, I could have asked the seller if the part on the axle matched the part I was purchasing. The axle looked like it was good quality, but just not the one I needed.
B000IDYKQO|5|Got one for my gf and one. Feels good knowing its there.
B00KWMG4A6|5|Took some trimming to fit, but the end product looks very nice. I was worried about the smell being talked about from some reviews, but it was minimal. Definitely worth the price.
B00LAPV6W0|4|Brake & clutch fit Fory 750i F01 .<br />The resting did not, the cut was opposite. Still looks nice.
B005BNZ59M|5|product is as advertised
B00KL3ALGO|5|I got these 3 weeks ago, I am in LOVE. You don't have to fool around with big tacky suction cups, just stick these right on the window and you're done! I will tell anyone and everyone about these. Great product if you need shades for your babies do not buy anything but these! Plus it's a small family owned company so put your money back into the economy and shop small business!!!!
B00X6MPQIU|5|These clamps are good size and quantity.  I didn't need a bag of 100 of all one size, I like the smaller quantity assortment.  These clamps are not stamped as stainless steel, I would hope they are because I think they are most useful on hoses to contain water.  They are slightly magnetic, using a very strong rare earth magnet they will stick to it with light force.  The clamp is the split type clamp, it is stamped from one strip of metal and curved into a circle.  It has small edges that hold the clamp together.  Other clamps I have used are one piece of continue metal.  The difference is that the one piece have nothing to get stuck on.<br /><br />For the price this is a great set and great assortment/qty.
B00505J6IW|5|Good Product.
B009PHKSDI|5|delivered fast. works fine
B00F23BNUG|5|These things are bright!
B00C0XPJ1U|5|Thank u my daughter cry
B000CIN83G|5|Excellent...top of line...fits both front ...not hard to install...fits 1999 cad deville  or concorse
B00GQ48FCY|5|Works Perfectly
B0067UAMIM|4|Fits great in my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8 engine. I replaced my original EGR valve and tube while trying to run down the pesky P0171 error code. Rust had appeared on the tube and on the valve. I wasn't sure that original part was functioning properly anymore. Came with a new gasket to connect to the throttle body. The gasket holes for the connecting bolts were slightly small, but didn't impede the install. It arrived promptly, and was undamaged. I did have to adjust the angle that the valve was connected on the tube so that it would align with the engine just right. That wasn't hard to do.
B00B93LHBI|4|LS3 emblems, nice for the price
B000EDSSMA|5|Slightly bigger than the stove top (Wedgewood Vision 3-burner stove) but still fit. I love that it fully folds back so you get access to the front burner and still have extra counter top.
B0017K69MA|3|Like other reviers stated it has it's limitations. When wiping they window it will be necessary to change pads to a dry pad to finish cleaning the window. Even after reading that in the reviews still purchased it and I agree with their reviews. Followed another reviers recommendation and placed oa microber towel over the head and used that for drying and it works good.
B009OLFO2K|2|Did not hold the handle bars still. The bars move up and down no matter how tight the screws are.
B007TY4THA|4|This part worked fine for my 1995 GMC Jimmy 4-door, but only after some modifications with a Dremel tool - it is NOT a drop-in identical replacement out of the box even though the part number cross-links to GM's original part number; somewhere along the line the design changed.  I had to carve out some internal plastic structure around the screw holes to fit the mounting surface, but once that was done it looks perfect.<br /><br />Careful removal of these internal plastic parts does not affect appearance, function or weather-tightness once installed, but be prepared to do it if you have the same vehicle as me.  15 minutes of Dremel carving did the trick.  The external appearance is identical to the original part, it's well made and very bright.
B007ZGBLNW|5|I put these lights on My new plow truck for back up lights for the the 2014-15 winter  . Even in blinding snow I can see far better than the old 55watt . I have not used them in heavy rain . So far I am extremely happy & the price kepts coming down. I paid 40.00 at the time. Make sure you get either the 30  or 60 degree according to your needs
B00VBNYOCK|3|Decent looking sticker but if you're looking for a sticker that says &#34; Toyota racing development &#34; look elsewhere when I received all 4 of mine they all said &#34;motor racing development&#34; didn't really bother me since I cut that part off
B000QGOPO0|5|Perfect fit sound is very good
B0030Q247S|1|This product is the worst I have ever used.  It contains 3 different Acids and not only did not clean my chrome wire wheels, it left a very stubborn chalky film on them that took me hours to get it off with Chrome cleaner and all kinds of brushes.  This product also destroyed my rear windshield because I was trying to clean the chrome trim around it and it got over sprayed on the glass and totally etched it and I have to replace the windshield.  Terrible stuff.<br />I have filed a claim for damages.
B00YBK3BQU|4|Just as advertised, this hose nozzle is very well made and I expect that it will last for years.  It also allows for a great variety of spray patterns by twisting the easy-to-turn head.  I also like the fact that the large plastic ring at the back end of the nozzle allows you to tighten it onto the faucet vary snugly without the need for tools (and to easily remove it as well).  However, I have two rather minor gripes that prevent me from giving this product five stars.  The first is that it is not as comfortable to hold as the traditional &#34;pistol grip&#34; that's on the vast majority of  hose nozzles.  The second issue is that, although there are an infinite amount of spray patterns available, twisting the head doesn't allow the nozzle to go from one extreme to the other.  For example, I would expect that when the ring was at one end of its available rotation, there would be either a broad spray that would eventually change into a power spray, or a power spray that would transition to a broad spray.  But what happens is that from a closed position, the spray pattern starts off somewhat broad, then moves to a more powerful spray, and then back to an even broader pattern.  Because I use this nozzle primarily to spray my flower beds and flower pots, I need a nice broad spray that I find at the very end of the available patterns, which means I need to go through the power spray pattern before getting to my flower spray pattern.  Again, no biggie, and I still give this nozzle a four rating.
B000NW8H3C|5|Exelentes
B007JG1W1E|5|We use this on our camper and so far it has worked well. Never any foul smell from stagnant water in the grey tank. Love the lemon scent
B00ESLBQXM|2|Specifically ordered this one because it didn't have the &#34;pivot&#34; logo. Product shipped did not match photos, had the additional logo. Also missing the nut required to install.<br />Logo can be removed with heat, straight edge, and a little goo be gone. As for the nut, TBD.<br />Do not be mislead by the touched up photos.
B002YG2QT6|2|Product description state 2 each.  Only parts for one hydrant repair..
B00KRHDX8M|1|I cleaned rims and put them on and they fell off in a day and don't fit like it shows they were to small
B00NFA8NRE|5|Great product and great company to buy from. Everything works as it should and is super bright!
B00SMQL62U|1|Sent me wrong product doesnt fit on my car i want my money back

B000M3V95U|5|Fabulous glass clean...no streaks.
B008427CZ2|5|these work for my 2003 nissan frontier.
B00QRHDIPY|1|Wrong part
B005X4QCAA|5|Does everything expected. Easy install and quick and easy to use in more than one vehicle.<br />makes ability to use tilt steering at any angle with easy view in windshield.<br />Suggest do not use polarized glasses as will override view in glass.
B004EAU2UK|5|Exactly as I expected, quality is good, never intended to use it as a tank bag, rather as a seat bag, fits perfect and does not move around.
B004I15ND6|5|Great part went right in!!!
B0044FQSY4|5|Works perfectly. Rattle is gone :-)<br />Not product related, but installation was very difficult.
B00HHGRXA0|5|I have used this company before and I haven't experienced any problems with their product.
B00EZBPNXE|5|Don't waste your money buying replacement tail lights from your local Mazda dealer or specialty parts supplier.  These lights are the EXACT same units you will receive if you order from the dealer--right down to the blue Mazda stickers on the box.  The lights themselves are stamped with the Koito name, the OEM supplier to Mazda.  They even include the updated thicker gasket to prevent the common moisture issue that plagued the originals.  At approximately $85 each they are a great buy versus the $150+ dealers charge.
B00A66GYDA|5|Works great, clears codes, no problem. Better than the $200 option at Advance Auto!!
B00DROI8RS|5|These are wonderful!!!!!
B008GNG5LG|5|These are nice. Nice quality. Didn't realize there are about 5 different sizes. I got the wrong size so these don't fit. Measure your wheel first. My 01 beetle is a 90mm stickers And these are NOT stickers. My fault for not taking the year seriously. I just figured they'd fit. NOPE.
B001A0F88I|5|These are great! I've seen comments about rattling, I really didn't notice it, but as soon as I received them, I modified them. Took 30 minutes for all six of them, but no rattle.
B00L8VY9MU|4|Good quiet pad... not super aggressive, smooth deliberate baking. Very little brake dust.
B00TL6ZZ6I|5|Good fit
B005F9I99K|5|Excellent

B001GC94EE|4|The blocks are fine. They're tapered and the pin and hole matches my 2002 f250 center pins. They seem narrower than OEM and do not have built in bump stops but I've never hit the factory bump stop anyways. Only reason I bought this kit is because it included U bolts, which would work great if they were threaded farther down. The instructions say to stack these with OEM blocks which is wrong on so many levels so that may be why the bolts are so long. I had to stack a few washers on them and cut the tops off to get these U bolts to work. But other than the hassle of needing washers and cutting them they seem pretty good.
B009LNIQV2|1|I order hundreds of products from Amazon and I was highly disappointed in this item. I do not like to leave back feedback as I don't like tohurt anyone company or reputation but I wad but happy with this product. Even after buying two different batteries this still didn't work. The first clue was that the casing was loose. Then even after doing the instructions step by step and having a alarm specialist try it still did not work. Because it was a special order it could not be returned do I have a useless remote.
B00825ZH8U|5|Love it!!! it fits with the 2012 2.7L Only problem was the main evap hose i had to modify it a bit in order to make it fit.
B002ZBWKAU|3|It works up to 40spi~
B000NWA672|5|Item was perfect, worked as expected
B000VUR6CE|5|Good quality for the price!  When other brands shatter or twist this set of bits gets the job done.
B005X9KO86|2|Did not work upon receipt.  Dometis gave us Authorized service center at camping world who refused to repair because we bought on line from Amazon.com. Would only offer to sell us a new one.  Finally took apart myself and found wire never connected.  Works excellent now.  This is why rating is only 2 star versus 5 star.
B00IF5BA1U|1|Disappointed to say the least. The ad stated it would fit my VW Jetta, but does not.
B008WFPCDA|2|If you're a stickler for detail you might want to stay away from these. I've seen the one's they sell at the dealer and there's a noticeable difference. First off, like someone pointed out, it reads &#34;GENES IS&#34;. It's not as blatant as it is in this text, but noticeable. Second, doesn't come with art of speed background; not that it claims it does, but others said it did. Lastly, the background to the shield part of the emblem should look carbon fiber, this one sadly does not.<br />Does come with 2... still debating if I'm going to use them.
B00OM8ID9G|5|Great product, fits the car perfectly..Will continue to buy from this seller.
B00EPDLCXM|5|Exactly what i thought it would be
B004GOCH2K|3|Great price for product but it won't stick!! I have an 03 avalanche with body cladding. I had to rip off the adhesive tape and bond silicone overnight to get it to hold. Also its now too big to fit my key hole through.
B00BBY9XVG|5|Excellent Product!!!
B00B0QWXW6|5|Did exactly what it has to do. Looks a bit corney though with how much it sticks out.
B00FN1ZE66|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00JASYEQE|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ.
B000F2LVRY|4|Fits just like the original cover fit, though both of them make it difficult to see the turn indicator monitoring lights; The material is OK but doesn't seem quite as substantial as the original was, though the original fell apart - my memory might not be that great. I've had it two years and it's as good as when we got it. Looks nice.
B00B3YBMQI|5|Excellent product... Installed on my security system and  works just as it was designed to do.
B006ID3M0S|2|After you tighten the bolts to the mount if the mirror it's moved amount the bolt comes loose in the mirror will fall off
B009VOQ05U|4|Nice and Sturdy, I used Loc-tite on the set screws, used to put it together. It works good and I haven't had problems using it to haul my kayaks around.
B007XYFUT2|3|Nice...too small. Size chart off by 2 sizes...
B004OK1FBK|5|Nice long shank and good quality.
B00B788KRO|5|love this stuff.  Not only does it smell great but it works as a water, lime and scale repellant in my shower, sinks and toilets.
B00CM4QY3O|3|They work ok, however if you tighten them down on the turn signal perches, the mounting stud pulls through the rubber that the signal mounts to. You have to leave them loosely installed to prevent this. But they were only $6... I also had to get a Littelfuse Electronic Flasher for $11 to make them flash properly. They're not terrible or stellar. The ship time was quick. I would recommend these, but you have to be careful on how tight you tighten the mounting stud.
B000WP8316|5|Worked Great
B00JGC6JO4|3|DoeS the job, but slightly too big for my Yukon XL.  Might help if they put some friction points on the bottom to grab the existing carpeting so it wouldn't slide backwards, but overall it's OK.
B000B68V90|1|I bought this at the local O'Reilly, I have painted a lot of engines thought I'd try this.  It went on like bed liner, wouldn't lay down unless you really piled it on.  There were little tiny balls of dried paint on the vertical surfaces from the paint drying before it hit the block and I was 6&#34; away from it.  Maybe I got a bad batch, maybe this paint truly needs low humidity and cold temperatures (non existent down south), used another brand gloss black engine paint, it did fine.  This stuff is very different than most engine paints I have ever used, I'm going to stick with VHT or another typical style engine paint next time.
B003TQ3YGY|4|works well
B00KTIE5VS|5|works great
B00L9J34B8|3|The product is just as described and works great.  The EXORBITANT shipping charges bring the cost up to just under the local dealers price.
B00MIPT326|3|Its pretty good Unit the Nav is spot on and resolution is decent, has nice chevy Logo when it first boots up sounds good , works well took some jerry rigging to get it to work with the steering wheel controls I had to hook the IR wire + the + remote wire + K1 wire + amp wire Took awhile to figure it out the instruction are crap and the manual for it is not helpful at all I still have not yet figured out how to set the clock or date.  The manual give you instructions for some other unit. But over all its nice unit few kinks but for under 400 bucks for BT NAV touchscreen its a fare deal.
B00QRVJ7TQ|2|While the concept of these wheel felts are helpful, I was disappointed in the seller.  One of the felt pads arrived torn to near shreds. I don't know if a mouse burrowed through it during storage at the factory or someone gave it to their dog as a chew toy.  Mea culpa that I procrastinated putting my tires in storage until after the Amazon return policy period. Also, pay close attention to the measurement of these pads. I used them to store 19 inch rims and these pads are one inch too small.
B001GRTP6G|5|These have saved my car. My husband is a neat freak and we live on a dirt road, the combination is not good. He was washing my car every other day- with these we have dramatically cut down on the mess that makes it onto the car and are very happy with the product. We purchased a second set for use on our new car as well. Highly recommend them, great product with EASY installation.
B000UD0CTQ|5|wonderful
B000E322O0|5|very good
B004FOM86Q|3|Caution these straps are NOT UV radiation protected. periodic use in the Florida Spring and Summer sun and humidity resulted in straps completely disintegrating. Inspect frequently, and replace as soon as any fraying starts as the failure happens very quickly.
B00760XLWG|5|so far so good,good company to deal with.<br /><br />thank you.
B008E66VSC|5|Very nice replacement product .. Buy with confidence
B00A4G4NXA|5|Good valentine for the money.
B0049IZLEO|5|I purchased these to fit over my heated grips of Can Am RT limited. It took some re-working around paddle shifter and minor grinding down of outer edges of original grips to fit properly.  I called Kuryakyn about which to order and they guided me to purchase these. I also added the Throttle Boss they sell which added even more comfort in my  grip. I am very happy with the end result.
B004UC6NLE|4|It was great
B004I9X8F8|3|Hello the Lily and humming bird is beautiful but too small for my shower door but, no worries I will figure out how to make it work, in the meantime, if you have a larger vinyl shower door window decal, please reach out to me and let me know, I thank you in advance,<br />Thanks again,<br />Carla
B009VTINUA|5|Huge ride improvement for my Jeep over the Procomp shocks.
B000I1M7GG|2|gas mileage the same, power the same ,just noisier  sorry,not worth the money!
B000VU57YS|5|Fit perfect, very heavy duty, nothing slips, great purchase
B000F2TNEC|5|Very nice color and fir great.
B009Z6OBOG|5|These are the way to go if you're going to convert fog lights to led.  They are no brighter than a halogen, but the color of them is why I got them, to match my 6K HID lights.  In those regards, they are great!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Works great in my 2003 F 150 SuperCrew. Had to re-think how to fold it again since it had been awhile since I had this type of screen. After a couple tries I got it. We definitely needs screens in Arizona.
B00ZB2DDEC|1|Not impressed at all.  I needed something to hold a drink.  The side pockets on this are really small. To small for any cup I came across on my road trip.
B007P749JE|5|Working great thus far.
B003QVIUV6|5|10000 miles an holding stong tension still.
B00KTJ6D26|3|Fine
B000H0RC8Q|5|Not very blue but i like them for the price.
B0008F671S|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE, CAN MAKE IT FIT ANYTHING, CAN'T GO WRONG. IF YOU NEED A  RECEIVER THIS ONE CAN WORK.!
B00PM9OHXU|5|lucky the same day I received these jeans in the mail is the day I had a bad motorcycle crash going about 60mph I high sided and these held up amazingly I had more damage on my textile jacket that on these jeans. They are very comfortable and the ventilation is amazing.
B006GFAJGI|4|Its cute.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|I love ths lights super bright
B0006IX7V0|5|using on a sunsetter awning much cheaper than there's work's perect.
B00GSAUHB8|1|Worst shade ever! My husband ordered the largest size, which is supposed to fit a minivan. It isn't even close to being large enough. The two sides of the shade are connected into one large piece. It is thin and extremely floppy, no stiffness to the borders to help the two circles stand up straight and stay in the window. The circles are surrounded by a large floppy edging of material that is worthless. Maybe if each side had an elastic band to hook around the van's Sun visors it would stay in place. Instead it falls down and lays across the steering wheel. I am returning it for an immediate refund!
B00ID9RF8U|1|when they say cosmetic imperfections &#34;BULL @@@@&#34; I was expecting some dents and scratches, not the lid being held on by 2 screws and the rest either falling out or gone, complete miss advertising. I know it was suppose to be brand new but it is completely unusable!
B00PNU1WCM|2|Probably great for vinyl wording and covering small items but terrible for wrapping onto large items. Very, very thin, making it very difficult to lay evenly at 24 inches wide without bubbles.
B003XU6ECM|5|Great gloves.  I sized a large and these fit fine.  They are well constructed with good ventilation.  The gel palms really made a noticeable difference.  The gel deadened the handlebar vibrations from my sport bike.  Glad I purchased these and will consider other Olympia gloves when I look for cooler weather riding gloves. Update (8-24-15):  Well, after riding with these gloves over a three-week period, I've decided they are too tight.  I thought they would stretch a little, but they are staying really tight especially at the thumbs.  So, I've ordered a pair in XL.  They are a little looser and less constricting around the thumb.  They should work...
B00NMW7YQQ|5|nice frame good price
B002SE1GA4|5|good quality
B0026N8WIQ|5|works good
B000CMJR1O|3|Nice design and they fit well even with no carpet as my Wrangler has spray in bed liner throughout the interior. My main complaint is the weight and thickness of the liner. The plastic is very thin and seems like a cheap Chinese knockoff but it came in a factory Husky box so I can only assume they are genuine. Again the form and fit is nice I just don't see how this thin plastic will hold up over time. FYI it looks like the rear liner is one piece however there are 2 pieces with the right side liner including the hump cover that slides underneath the left rear liner.

B005CF8758|5|Good!!
B00873J0YY|5|Excellent racks that supported both of my kayaks. Easy to install and no adjustments were necessary after the initial install. The price was very low for this level of quality. We are truly impressed and happy with our purchase.
B00OEC85F2|5|Dr Who duh
B00ORJZE7O|2|I purchased these lights to replace my stock angel eyes led lights on my BMW X5.<br /><br />Installation: Relatively straight forward. HOWEVER, the heat sinks on the back of these lights protruded too far out of the back of the headlight assembly for the caps to screw on. Since it is absolutely necessary to have the assembly closed off from the rest of the engine compartment, I had to heat up the plastic screw-cap covers with a hair dryer and kind of jam them on there while I tried to screw them on. I was nervous this could break some of the seemingly fragile components of the head light assembly, but so far I've had no problems.<br /><br />Looks:  The light itself is nice and white, as opposed to the stock yellowish look. Also, the light is very bright. BUT, the reason I only give the product  two stars (besides installation difficulty) is that while the inner rings of the angel eyes are nice and bright (very much lit up), the outer rings are BARELY lit up at all. The outer rings, more or less, are not lit up at all. When you look at the newer BMWs with the white colored angel eyes, BOTH rings are lit up and very bright. This is the look that I wanted, but on my car, only one ring on each side (inner rings) are illuminated. This might be due to incorrect installation: I've heard that some of the led lights are specific to drivers/passenger side, but there was no indication on these bulbs. I posted a question on Amazon, asking the seller about this, but I've received no reply.<br /><br />They are fairly cheap, so maybe you get what you pay for.
B000C9PZHM|5|The sensors were packaged well and there was no issues. Exact factory replacement for my 00 GMC Yukon 5.3.

B00JXNK1Z4|4|Bought these for my 09 Toyota Corolla only complaint is the back seat doesn't stay on good because I can't reach under my seat to tie the ties
B00HWIB0FM|4|This horn is amazing. It brightens almost everyone's day, the installation was super easy, it works really well, and it's LOUD. My only complaint is that there isn't as much hose as I would've liked. (and this doesn't apply to everyone, I just had to put the horns all over the place in order to fit them)
B00194927S|5|True fit, great construction, sturdy heel and sole, real value for the money.
B003LD1MUU|5|They may be inexpensive but after 2 years these are still going strong
B007MAYVI8|4|Priced good, clear instructions, easy installation. Installed in my driveway with hand tools in under 2 hours.

B0002JMF9I|5|was exactly right.  very satisfied
B006HJ2R18|5|Looks great, but isn't as easy as you think
B009VYWIMO|5|After having bought and tried installing unsuccessfully another cheaper brand, I took my time and looked and surfed through a lot of backup cameras finally decided on Peak. It had a very good install video and instructions were good that came with it. My only comment would be, make sure your connections are good at the backup light my positive red wire to my green in my case wasn't quite touching bare wire good with the supplied crimping snap coupling until I double checked it and found that was the problem. after that adjusted the camera angle, backed up beautifully to my trailer. Very worthwhile, not at all hard to install.
B008SEFORO|2|Color is fading , rusted

B003FBV8ZW|5|Awesome!
B0020PUXIM|5|Great plate, just like the old days
B00RW7W7G4|5|These wipers are the best I have purchased for my suv.  I live in the south and drive in intense rain at times.  I need wipers I can depend on and these are them.  They wipe perfectly and leave no streaks at all.  They appear to be more durable than other wipers that I have owned.  I would highly recommend these and I plan on purchasing them again when the time comes.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Blocks the sun, heat and can store this little thing anywhere! Works great on my M4! 5-Stars all the way!
B012X49ENY|5|By far this is one of my favorite car organizers because it’s right on the back of my seat. It has a ton of space to keep things close so they’re not bouncing around the car during the drive. My wife loves it for holding her purse so it’s not lying on top of her feet while riding. My kids love it because it keeps their tablets in close reach. I honestly use it every day and cannot even explain how helpful it is.
B00TX2W07W|1|This item is listed as fitting a 30mm handlebar.  Which, for us Americans, equates to between 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 inches.  I ordered it for a 1&#34; bar thinking I would just put in a rubber spacer to get it to fit.  I received it yesterday, NOT EVEN CLOSE.  I measured the opening with a digital caliper and got 21.5 - 22 mm  That is a little smaller than 7/8&#34;  Glad I only paid $25
B00N7KNI1S|5|Looks great! Solid metal construction. Not just plastic. Installs in a snap!
B001V8U12M|5|Lifesaver
B009AA5V46|5|Look great and feel great.  Im very satisfied with my purchase.

B009DNW1SO|5|They look great and feel great.  No complaints.
B002WP362U|5|Got this to install with the dynamat extreme. It is worth getting to help keep moisture out, and also from any material seeping over the edge of the aluminum sheet. The rolls aren't very long, so plan to order extra for your project.
B00AC6Y9S6|5|Awesome bag while it lasted.  Somebody razor-bladed the straps and took it from where I parked it every day at Cromwell's beach in Diamond Head.  Probably will go back to hard cases...
B007H2PD1K|5|Used in drawer of my boat. 1991 Carver. Exact fit. Could not have asked for better
B00LWUX2W0|5|Good deal
B004A30MGA|4|Good product a little thin. I will use a brush for next application , as you tend to roll it out to thin with a roller .
B00IF966S8|5|WORK AS EXPLAINED.
B001GKHKE2|5|easy install
B00873J0YY|2|I should have spent more money and bought racks of higher quality.  The tool included to assemble the rack was too large for the bolts.  My husband had to melt away the plastic on the grip tight nuts in order for them to fit.  Putting the rack together was a tedious process when it shouldn't have been.  The company enclosed a letter telling the consumer not to give neutral or poor feedback without calling them first.  I didn't call because nothing needed replacing, it was just &#34;cheap&#34;.  Once I installed the racks, they worked fine, but I am not looking forward to taking them off my car.
B003S6CXVW|5|My husband watched a YouTube video on how to replace this part. Glad Amazon had it. Saved us hundreds of dollars. Was installed without any hassle at all.
B00HOJXQ0Q|5|Awesome vinyl sticker! Good quality vinyl with a great adhesive.
B00FH8P1DG|1|It works great but moister keeps getting behind the lense
B00FDQPCR2|2|Never has worked well.
B00ISA49WO|2|I ordered these at the end of last year. I didn't get around to installing them until April 2015 within the first week ALL the welds started to rust.  Every time it rains they leave rust stains all over my vehicle.  They look nice right out of the box but be prepared to repaint them before you install.  If I had known the quality of the finish was so poor I probably would have gone with Smittybilt or one of the other more expensive brands.  Now I have to remove them and have them painted NOT A FUN TASK.  E-autogrilles  reply to me was since I installed them already they can't do anything to help me.  Well obviously the rust didn't show until they were installed they were indoors up to that point.  Buyer Beware do not trust the factory finish on these MAYBE if you live in the desert otherwise be prepared to paint them or look at rust everyday
B00BD2P7X4|5|Exactly as described. Received yesterday. Brought to dealer this morning. An hour later plus $68.67 and I rode out with remote start. They also reprogrammed my old fobs, so now I have 2 remote start and 2 lock and unlock fobs. Great deal! Another dealer told me I had to buy from them and it would be a total of $385.00. Do yourself a favor and shop around. Others wanted $120.00 to program + tax. My total spent kit and program was $253.00. That was less than what the other dealer wanted just for the kit. GREAT VALUE! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. ..
B00XC7QIMC|5|Tiene wifi
B000E8T80Q|5|I only use this filter (in combination with Mobil 1 oil) in my vehicles and replace it after 10K miles. No issues so far and I have 210K miles on my Civic.
B00EECL7OS|5|Even though Amazon has the &#34;Make Sure It Fits&#34; interface to help shoppers find the right part for their vehicle, check the headlight in your car to make sure. Amazon says the D1S does not fit in my 2006 BMW 330i, but that is wrong. I checked for myself and you can see by the attached picture showing the back and side view of the headlight that it does fit my car. I replaced both headlights without issue for $61. The BMW dealership quoted me $432.
B000AP57SU|5|Quite airish.  You can almost see through it.  I put a foam filter over it as I was concerned about small particles entering the intake.

B00O1T056A|1|Started with a wonderful excitement. I get this in the mail in the evening. start my Nissan Versa 1.8L that evening and was happy! Mesured battery voltage before jump, it was 10.12V.<br />Since it started wonderfully, I unplugged it and kept it for charging until next day morning.<br />Next day morning outside temperature is 60 Degees F and took out the jumper setup to start the car so that i can drive it to the repair shop. Measured battery voltage before jump, it was 9.98V.<br /><br />And it failed! FAILED to jump my tiny small engine Versa! I tried it 3-4 times, all fail. The red light at the jumper cable kept blinking.<br />So, frustrating!!!<br />May be the lower voltage was too low for this jumper to handle. Something ANKER should look at.<br /><br />I have used several Anker products and all were great, EXCEPT THIS! Returned it the next day. This sucks.<br /><br />Had to call road side assistance to jump it!
B0015YBX7Y|4|Looks to be nicely made. The strap on the bottom is pretty much useless. An elastic strap that hooks together would be a better design.
B00W8ADB1K|4|just getting used to it.  It does hold some things from the glove compartment.  Not used to looking somewhere different, but I like it.  Works for the cell phone, etc. small stuff.
B00498QC88|5|Perfect fit
B003ENE6LO|4|You can install these without a special tool -- I did. But it took about 15-20 minutes, and was seriously tricky to maneuver the pieces.<br /><br />It works perfectly now -- holds a lot of weight. I only installed one in case I ever needed to fit something large in the other side of the trunk. They would get five if they were easier to install.
B00HFWZ1NW|3|Did not fit my vehicle.

B00Z132F2W|1|Sadly these bushings are junk. They are too thin and have more play than the worn ones I removed. They mic. out at .061 thickness the originals are .091 making the bolts way too loose, Ill be tossing them in the trash. It's true you get what you pay for but with shipping I wasted $5.
B007H2PYBY|5|Can't beat what you get for the money
B008I4H70G|4|Pro:<br />1. Inflates way faster than other inflators<br />2. Is cordless (it can plug into the cigarette lighter -or- you can remove that cord and have it run off the rechargeable battery).  Being cordless is awesome.  I can quickly move around to all 4 car tires without having to worry about plugging a cord into the cigarette lighter outlet, can inflate bikes and stuff in garage without hookup to car, etc.<br />3. Rechargeable batteries are easily removable (I have a spare battery in case I run out of juice)<br />4. Gauge is accurate/reliable<br /><br />Con: the hose that it comes with doesn't have a quick-release head, you have to screw it onto the valve.  I retrofitted mine to have a QR head like most bike pumps have.<br />Con: battery charger lights don't work that well, can't tell exactly when it is full, so I just charge the batteries overnight.

B00Y1HRX26|3|Keys programed well, but the keys seemed to be thinner than OEM's and after being cut they need some manipulation to turn. I haven't minced them yet and will do so sometime later.
B00Q7K3SZ6|5|Palm Tree Detailing is wonderful, it jumps off the license plate and makes a wonderful statement. Nice durable quality, easy to install.
B000C83ODK|4|I replace the coil on my 1993 seadoo 17.5 horsepower and I'm still not getting spark
B005F9I9CM|5|Excellent
B00N5XEOMY|4|Only wished I understood before I got the 2 1/2 system.  I could have used the 2 in system.  The mud guards are working fine.  Currently on the AlCan and they are doing their job every day we travel these gravel roads.
B00HEPH26O|5|I was told this couldn't be found eye. I needed it for my 88 wagoneer.  This worked perfectly and my ac is finally working and COLD again.
B000HHVJWY|3|When it was torqued almost all the way down the corner started bending, then started cracking. So I stopped turning it. Luckily it stayed in place long enough for me to finish the job. Probably not enough strength left in it for another job tho.<br />Tips : when tightening allow a few seconds between turns for the tensioner to settle down and relive pressure,it will minimize the chance of your tool breaking
B002UC6PWS|3|The quality of these brackets and other brands like them leave a desire for something better. As for the rest of the purchase I give 5 stars. I would suggest to any one who owns an RV to buy a few extra packs of these. They tend to fail and having them handy is easier than ordering again.
B008G4Y076|5|They work great, and people ask (what are thoes?!) Clean very very slight blue. And it blinds compact cars. Eat that Prius!
B000C7YATI|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B00E1TOSJK|5|It is awesome
B00JAXIZT6|5|I've always bought weather Tech for my cars. They are a little pricey but worth the money. Had my old car for 5 years and had them in from day one. When I traded it in the guy that was doing the evaluation for the trade in value was surprised that the carpet still looked brand new for a 5 year old vehicle. This is a good investment if you have a vehicle that will have high traffic especially kids.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great gauge that fits tire valve at an adjustible angle. Even better (and not mentioned in the description)... the gauge holds pressure on the dial so you can read the measurement easily. Just press the bleed air button to release the needle to 0.
B0000AXYLP|5|works great
B008C9YJ6C|1|Did not allow my led turn signals to blink at all. As far as I can tell it didn't do the function it was  supposed to.
B00D8DR0AO|5|Totally revolutionized the way I wash!  Listen, I'm not saying that if you have a pile of nasty Northeast salt grime on your ride that this is gonna be your go to...  But, on those occasions that you look at your vehicle and go &#34;crap, this thing is friggin dirty&#34;, it's perfect.  Cuts car washing time in a quarter!  It's black magic, I swear!  Weirdest stuff ever!  You'll see, just try it!
B00C5RB03W|5|This did the trick for my sewer hose!
B001JT7CU2|5|Just what I needed
B008X02RGE|5|Installed on 2004 honda odyssey, excellent fitment had no issues with the install. Installed one side in 30-40min. Please note that you will need an alignment after changing the struts, mine was off by 2.3 degrees after installing the struts. Ride is good not too soft or hard, we will see how long they last. One of the struts had a squeak when compressed when I went over speed bumps, but went away after 2 days. I guess the struts were breaking in.<br /><br />Update: Has the struts for over 2 week, no squeaks. Went on a long 1,600km drive over the weekend and the struts are even better now, they absorbs bumps better and are more smoother. I guess they have fully broken in, I would highly recommend.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Exactly as order shipped quick
B006DX17DW|5|Tried after market brands did not work put this in excellent
B00HY06S9G|5|Don't usually leave reviews. But it only takes a couple of minutes to replace the dome light. And it makes the interior look significantly better.
B00HVPRK7S|5|If you from New Mexico get your official zombie hunting license  ;)
B004VLDI62|2|I bought  2 ball joint and  I had problems with one of them. one of them came with a ball joint nut that was not like the one pictured. it was larger and had a flared bottom sort of like a built in washer. the problem is that type of nut will not fit in the hub, then when I went to bolt the ball joint to the lower control arm one of the nut was a different size. the odd sized nut was the nut intended for the shaft.  luckily I had an extra nut that I used to secure the ball joint to the control arm.  mI used this product on my 2000 Audi TT. the product is a perfect fit and the quality seems  to be OK, no problem there, if I didn't have problems with nuts I would give a higher rating, however when you have these types of error, use has to suspect poor quality control. so poor quality = poor rating.
B00062ZICM|4|So far it's working very well.  I use it on an outside application and the glass is holding up nicely.
B00HFRQDQQ|4|Looks great love the gold i got this for a 05 gsxr 600 only crummy thing is it seems like its stretching
B003MB4NUC|5|It was a fair purchase.
B008L5J5G6|5|METAL, MUCH BETTER THAN THE FACTORY CRAP PLASTIC ONES
B00DEVI2PW|5|Great price, fast shipping.  Accurate display of voltage increase and decrease.  Useful tool to diagnose voltage loss as operating AC will do.
B0084H26OY|4|It wouldn't accept a charge until it simply shut off. Wouldn't turn back on after following their websites instructions. Sounded like there was something rattling inside of the shell.<br /><br />They replaced it under warranty and the new one has been working fine.
B004JAZ7H8|1|Garbage!!!!  I love diamond plated armor,, would look great if they even came close to fitting!!!! The specs were way off...I returned this item and got the less cool looking plastic ones from Amazon,,, which look and fit perfect! Don't get these....u will love them.....until you take them out of the box and attempt to mount them.
B000C6SLB2|5|Got water pump in Australia within 2 weeks great price over $100 here but only $24 on Amazon my pump had the cast impeller good quality unit works perfectly just not a fan of changing them on a town and country lol
B00I53G8A0|5|Nice mats!  Thanks.
B007W9O36O|1|I got it today and after try directly put it back to it's box and send to rubbish box...  Unfortunately I paid additional 70 USD for international transfer, If you want to just have a fun and lough for your self for 5 minutes, buy it... :)
B0077NI2Q2|4|Great for the price
B007SAUJFQ|5|Just,perfect. Thanks. My truck is running  excellent
B004LX3AS6|5|Worked perfectly for my ATV.
B008OEPHQG|4|I was very pleased with order. I received my order in a timely manner and that makes me happy!!
B000C93C1S|5|Perfect exhaust pipe for my Jeep.  I used it to install a new muffler (Flowmaster Super 44).  It fit in perfectly and projects the noise really well.  Great tail pipe for the price
B00GZ88SGY|5|no problems, great look, great lighting
B006O85UNE|4|The chain looks good and i have already done 4k kms on it. But for some reason it develops slack very often.. My stock chain on Ninja 650 2013 didn't have this problem.. Also, my experience is the chain doesn't hold the lube for more than 400 kms. Stock held it for 500kms easily.
B00TMFAUZE|5|WONDERFUL item!
B0006JLU22|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B0016GZGQU|5|Nice set of lights.  Looks great inside my sons Mustang!
B001G7L2Y4|1|Would not fit.  Bad threads.
B003OG0XK4|2|The suction cup did not hold on our car window. Sent them back.
B00JQJ8GO8|5|Awesome product.
B009B0BXMO|5|wonderful for winter in Buffalo
B0097CE2NS|5|Works great and easy to program
B005CWSBT8|1|Carborator leaks returning for a refund
B00D2YVBTA|5|Did not work out in out cup holders but loved the idea
B0002JMV06|5|Not a fan of ford products as this was a favor for my father in law. This is a Motorcraft product and fits great and works fine.
B0048SLN3S|5|Always a quality product with good performance.
B0002NYBC8|5|I own a number of older Mercedes-Benz vehicles, some of which are affected by the dreaded AC evaporator failure. Replacement entails a flat rate time ranging from 20-24 hours to replace the evaporator.  I do all of my own service work, but even this job is something I would not undertake due to the time and complexity.<br /><br />When my 1995 S500 coupe (W140) developed a leak that had the system leaking down in roughly a week, I knew it was evaporator time. Bummer.<br /><br />As this car was approaching 300,00 miles, I wasn't about to invest far more than the value of the car to keep it cooling, so I researched AC sealers. Several Mercedes buddies suggested the ClipLight sealer, so I figured I would roll the dice for $35 and give it a try.<br /><br />Before I started, I called ClipLight and spoke with one of their product support people. It turned out they were one of the engineers that designed the product! They were very informative and helpful, and gave me a lot of good information on the process of using the product and how to be sure I would be successful.<br /><br />I went through the process of replacing the receiver/dryer, pulling down the system, and charging it with the sealer. The process was simple and straightforward.<br /><br />Once I started charging the system with refrigerant, I got cold air starting around 50% charge. By the time I had a full charge in the system I was seeing vent temperatures approaching 40F!<br /><br />The system has remained charged and making ice cubes since that time, roughly 8 months ago. I would add that I live in Florida, so the AC gets used almost constantly year 'round.<br /><br />Great stuff, I highly recommend! While it won't fix every leak, if you follow the instructions it definitely does the job.
B00CAYC9RQ|5|Love it.
B007G2KJTW|5|Looks great! The green is a dark forest green, it's the strong &#34;plastic&#34; feel to it.. the sand and dirt will fall through!  Not messy when it gets rained on, doesn't hold water.. this one was 35, and it's no different then the one I found at a store for 50!
B0082365AQ|3|Product was missing nuts fresh from package, straps across top to short to allow cart to open to width to properly lock into indexed position.<br />I removed strap and had to add another. Good design, poor production.
B003XWEO8Q|5|These worked really good. Easy to install and very comfortable. I had to actually sand some of the plastic around the cable guide so it would rebound properly and not stick, but that was easy and wasn't a problem.
B00BU60HTW|5|Bought for my son for go-kart racing.  Helmet looks great, fits great, and has a lot of ventilation.  I'd definitely buy another.
B001DKT0DO|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT ❤️
B00U8NHKXY|1|It's cheaply made and VERY flimsy.
B00EAOIKVI|4|Sort of expensive for a filter. The quality seemed good, and it installed easily on my Nissan Altima.
B0070Y34M0|5|perfect
B00HVJDHVW|5|It fit perfect & works great!
B00JRHI1LM|5|We really love our RV mattress - it is just firm enough and comfy enough for a perfect night's sleep!! Bought this several months ago and have used it all this summer on camping trips - we're getting wonderful, restful nights of sleep on the road!! Highly recommend.
B002M3KSK0|5|Perfect!  Great value, durable, perfect fit.
B0001EWCRO|5|I received this item in great time and the work and look great !
B0009NUG66|5|Worked Great!
B00B7ORHNG|2|It's a must have that should have been included in the purchase of a high end fishfinder. Way overpriced for a simple piece of plastic. Be sure to fasten it on the fishfinder with a bungee or velcro strap as mine blew off on the second trip to the lake and now I have to drop another $20 on a simple piece of plastic that doesn't fit snug enough to roll down the road at 55 mph.
B001UFRV38|4|Easy install
B000J2JE0G|5|Goes straight on 2003 Ford Escape licence plate lights!
B00BSI0OL8|5|Amazing!  saved lots of money.
B002ZI1TKK|5|We love it!  We've gotten several compliments.  Cheers up our five year old Scamp 5th Wheel RV trailer.  Thanks for your work!
B00KTHXZLU|4|Worked perfect just like the original key fob case
B00BPHOC6A|5|excellent quality for the money....Looks real good
B00G35GEQA|1|Don't waste your money. This set is pure rubbish. I tried using it on 2&#34; straight exhaust pipe and the thing broke before I even started putting some real torque on it. I gave it one star because I can't give it a zero.
B004FST8ZQ|5|Quick delivery, EZ installation. Those Eagle boys just might know what they are doing! ;-)
B005RNGL9O|5|I used these to strop knives. Did a good job.
B00332HMGM|5|Bought along with  &#34;Genuine Mazda Accessories 0000-81-Z40A Satellite Radio Receiver Kit&#34;  to add Sirius radio to my Mazda 3 that didn't have it installed at the factory.  Worked perfectly.
B000182ET6|5|Great price!
B00GUF74HQ|5|Works great, as advertised!
B000NCOKZQ|4|Good, but fuse inline makes difficult to use
B000BZI4ZW|5|Super value for an aftermarket fuel injection install.
B00JTUBTU2|5|item can fast at a good price
B000C7NBTS|5|Not much to say. Arrived quickly and complete
B0000AXPVD|5|great product
B00X3UYXM0|4|This product is OK I've had multiple times where it had problems connecting to multiple BMWs that I tried to code if I were to do it again I would most likely go with the cheap version because I'm having some of the same issues
B005J68N9A|5|Great magnet.  Reflective blue works wonders.
B004QPCLC0|5|Fit great and look great. Great deal.
B004FFHJ14|4|Useful product
B00265M9SS|4|Worked as described
B0083DVN4I|5|Great items for great price.
B00H2W43RA|5|This shitss great
B004HYLX88|5|This was my first purchase from bushwacker. These caps look great on my 02 Silverado. They were packaged well and installed nicely. Make sure your truck bed is clean and take your time while installing. They have heavy duty adhesive strips and you must make sure you have them where you want them. I just wish bushwacker would lower the price on their fender flares
B002692308|5|It did meet my expectations, and I have installed the bezel.  It is working fine.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Robert
B004SND72S|5|Product fit perfectly on coupe.  The white/CF contrast also looks great.
B000A8MY0Q|5|Worked as it was intended to,just like new.
B000EQ2NZK|4|Been in about a month and seems perfect so far. Glad to have sending unit working again too.
B008PBTXAO|1|Not reliable, every time i turn the vehicle on, i had to turn the lights on and off to get both bulbs to turn on. Switched to DDM bulbs and havent had any issues.
B008SEM724|5|as stated
B00XZ9MYRA|4|I purchased two of these for my 2005 Mazda 6s after I found out that the dealer would charge me $98.00 (including programming fee) for only one fob.  When I received them there was a slip of paper with instructions.  It doesn't mention how rapidly you are supposed to cycle through the switching of the ignition or how rapidly to open and close the door so I was not able to get the car in program mode.  I called the tech support number during business hours 3 different times and no one answered so don't depend on them if you have problems.  There is a video on YouTube (How to program the keyless entry remote for 2005 Mazda) that shows how to do this easily.  The remotes work great but the customer service is not so great, for that reason I rate this 4 stars.
B0063RHGFG|5|1/10th the price of what ford would have charged for OEM ones.
B000NOQTQC|5|very good deal, the quality can be compare with some big brand
B004HCM9H4|5|Love the wax!! easy to buff off when dry!! Problem I had cheap plastic bottle it is in dropped on ground side cracked open.
B0029TQDLA|5|very handy
B008427D88|4|These were the wrong size for my car ( my fault for not checking ) they were good quality though
B00AU75KQC|5|Great product...perfect fit!!!!
B000FG9TBK|4|Good product, smells good. As advertised
B000NW4QVO|5|How is looks in the picture is how it looks when its delivered. It took me 5 mins to pop this bad boy in and the wind was blowing in my hair again! Not one complaint over here! Worth every penny!
B000CO8RAY|2|Very nice...
B00XKVW9XC|5|Really good sound<br />Very loud and clear sound  coming in and out of mic.<br />Recommended
B000BQP5AS|5|Yes!  This plate worked perfectly.  I mounted it on a flat bed carhauler and it worked perfect loading and unloading a fullsize F150 pickup truck.
B002XJNQSY|5|Love it!
B00AO0DRV0|5|This item fit the rear passenger door as said and everything works properly. Received on time.
B00LUS7HXE|4|good
B00CZQ7AXM|5|fit well and stay in place.
B00X94Z2UM|3|It arrived quicker than expected. However, there was no outline as its pictured, and without it it looked unfinished.
B000E4OHNS|5|Just like the original. Easy install.
B005EY2X16|5|Yes fits like a gem!!! Looks just like the ones of my moms new 2014 Equinox
B00K6TPQXQ|4|It was very easy to install
B0002KKIXC|5|This is one of the few carpet cleaners I have found to actually work on our tan colored carpet. Our kids (ages 6 & 2) as well as our dog put it to the test on a regular basis. I have always ordered this through Subscribe and Save, but recently I happened upon it in the store for about a one-third the price. I highly recommend the product, but you may want to shop around to see if you can snag a better bargain locally.
B00BTGSID0|5|Awesome product.
B00OW204W6|5|Front projector lights worked out perfect
B00RZ1TKYE|5|I live in a cold climate and have had a few cars not start. Being stranded sucks. It always seems to happen at the worst times, too, like when you're at a store late at night and have tons of groceries to get home!<br /><br />For that reason, I decided to try the Maxmade battery. It worked awesome, starting my car right away. There was no lag time between using the device and getting moving. It does wonders for my piece of mind as I travel by myself frequently. What's also neat about the battery is that it won't just start you car. It can also be used for powering other devices.So if you're stranded with a dead phone you can get a charge and get the help you need.<br /><br />The only con is that it is a little heavy. But that's because of the power of it. And it's not a big deal because your car will be carrying it, not you! I am so happy to have this in my car. I feel a lot safer knowing that I have a backup in case my car doesn't start.
B009II4IG2|4|GOOD DELIVERY TIME, GREAT DEAL, ON THIS BATTERY, SAVED A TRIP TO THE STORE, THANKS.
B005MZWXC6|1|This is utter garbage.  Anyone who buys this needs to go back to middle school for a science refresher course.
B000BUOSGG|5|product is as advertised
B00JDHQKEQ|5|Great mirror. Moves easily in any direction. Very pleased to have two of these rear view mirrors.
B0000AXRH5|3|meh.  it's a funnel.
B00BITHKD2|5|Perfect !
B00COOSF98|5|Amazing looking headlights! The installation was surprisingly easy and only took around 15 minutes, including taking off the bumper and taking out the headlights (Nissan Altima 2009). So pretty much, the install for the headlights alone took around 5 minutes. The plug'n'play works fantastic.
B001JT5TQQ|5|What can you say about something like this? Simple, but does what it's supposed to do. Happy with it and price was just right
B001EQ41BI|5|Great fit and great look. Direct bolt-on with zero modification.
B001AXGT7O|5|great
B000A0O27C|5|Looks nice!  and it fit perfectly.
B00AQZB0V2|5|Saved a lot of money from buying this part.  My husband installed it in 5 minutes.  Watched a video on Youtube!!
B0049L4YIU|5|Works great
B00FDQPCR2|5|I have a large yard and have attempted Malibu lights but my dog tears them out.  I needed a light that would last and give light in the yard so I can walk around, play with my dog, and entertain guest.  This light works great, I even bought another one.  The light is a soft white.  The timer works great and as long as there is motion in front of the light it will stay on (which is perfect if I am walking back and forth or standing in front of it).  The motion sensor on it works great.  One of my favorite features that it has is there is a on/off/auto switch.  So if I have other lights on and don't want that light to turn on I have the option to turn it off or keep it consistently on.
B000EVYGZA|5|Great muktimeter for twenty bucks. Easy to use and seems accurate.
B0082365AQ|5|Great price. Excellent value
B003IS3HV0|5|I use this on my Keiffer English saddle because it is the only thing that keeps the leather lovely and supple.  A little goes a very long way and it even has a warm, pleasing scent.  Highly recommend this for your well-loved leather products.
B00FQ0ROZS|4|theyre good lights. really bright. they don't shine all that far but that's okay. more of a flood beam which isn't an issue to me. it almost got 5 stars. theyre pretty easy to install, and they look nice and have worked well so far. the issue with them, was not with the lights at all. the company only sent me 2 instead of 4. I emailed them multiple times over 5 days before they actually did anything about it and i had to all but threaten them with a scathing review just to get them to help me. they wouldn't read theyre emails, and when i would reply they would always think i was a new person with a new problem even though the whole conversation was right there in the email. after fighting with them long enough, they finally fixed this and i said i would give them 5 stars for handling it when i asked. but then something else happened.. when the other two lights arrived, they packaged them wrong and i was forced to pay $7.15 for the shipping. and i wasnt about to start the email war back up to get them to comp 7 dollars for me so instead they lose a star for not dealing with it properly
B00Z8TGYR6|5|Great set of LED light system
B000C7VYRO|5|good replacenent aluminum abit heavyer but does great job on cooling verry happy
B0000AY7GN|5|if you want a real anchor this is it. This digs in like it's supposed to, and will keep you where you are wanting to be.
B009ZGAG18|5|Better than spending a small fortune for one from a dealership!
B004GCR3US|5|Perfect fit
B00JBIB9X4|5|Great product, a little tight with fitting but overall works great
B00E9HWSV4|5|thanks
B000CNB52C|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 Lincoln LS V6 with the sport package. A+
B00RV46YBC|3|I received my LED switchbacks before the date specified which is nice, the only problem was that the driver side went out and wont even turn on, the passenger side is just find and blinks as well. I never purchased resistors as I was told they are technically not needed unless you want to stop hyper blinking. I called JDM ASTAR and told them the problem. the first guy was nice but sent me off to his manager who couldn't really speak English well so that and the phone on top of that, i couldn't really understand her all that well. She wanted to give me a link to their resistors on amazon claiming that I needed them for my 99 mercury cougar, but like i told her the passenger side worked just fine and i even placed the older bulb in the driver side socket and it worked so it had to be that the LED i purchased from them was faulty. So i will buy resistors from another place like autozone and see if the LED works then. if not im getting a new LED.
B001DKJU8Y|4|Not as good a job as a true headlight restoration kit, but 80% of the job done with a lot less fuss, for less money and with nothing more than a rag. I would say unless you have some really bad headlights, give this product a try first and you may be very pleasantly surprised.
B003BZD08U|5|Good product
B000CIPIMA|5|Great product! Put it in my 05 TJ inline 6 4.0L and though it may be quieter than your expect.. It really is a nice mature sounding exhaust.<br />Not to loud but definitely know it's there.<br />Increased mileage and power.<br />Happy customer here.
B00268JH3A|5|Now a product that worked as it should.  Was easy to install with the help of my brother it is basically a two person job to make it go quicker.  I have used it numerous times with my kayak and ladders and such.  Its rubber inlay really helps grip whatever I have put on it.  I do recommend these.
B0006ODWGO|5|I needed a new intake hose because the original was dry rotted, this product fits perfectly and it's easy to install.
B002BHX1X8|5|Used to change battery on 2008 Toyota Highlander Sport. Worked very well. No lost data or problems of any kind. I inserted Solar plug partly into cars port so light didn't come on and not plugged into jumper battery (placed jumper battery on drivers seat). Removed battery hold down and checked batter cable nuts to be sure they were not frozen in place. Waited 25 minutes for things like &#34;RAP&#34; (retained accessory power) to time out, leaned through open driver side window and inserted Solar plug the rest of the way into car socket and Solar light came on. Plugged &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; end of Solar into jumper battery on the drivers seat (checked jumper battery voltage before beginning). Made sure the positive and negative battery cables were wrapped  in a couple old work shirts so they wouldn't short to anything, and swapped batteries. Reconnected battery cables (plus then minus) and checked radio setting and made sure the vehicle started. No problems at all.
B00Y18E58A|5|Love it, orange is my color, I have already rewrapped the wiring harness with the same color orange!! Thanks team keep up the awesome job!! Pleased customer for life!!
B0017K69MA|5|Works as advertised
B000BM8RT8|5|Nice product, compact but still powerful to inflate tires.  One think I did  not like about it is the inflator, I was trying to use it on a small stroller tire and was unable to fit it onto the value. But as the product is described designed for use on trucks, SUVs, 4X4s, and RV tires. but also works well to inflate household items.
B00JH23DIS|5|My Vespa LX 150 would not start because the battery died (to the point where I couldn't even recharge it).  I ordered this battery, popped it in, and boom, it started right up, nice and strong!  No worries about my battery dying and leaving me stranded now.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Works great!
B0002JSZ8I|5|Just as explained
B001UFRW6O|3|I expected much better handling & cornering. Not sure I would make this purchase again. Installation instructions suck.
B008Y9K3TW|5|Works perfect will shop again
B00K9YY0JE|5|Good quality brake pads, put them right on and hit the road!
B00068XCQU|4|GREAT PRODUCT
B00PWG6AC4|5|My wife has a little car with a big windshield. They fit the windshield well but since they are large and the car's cabin is small, it is awkward to fold and unfold them. Otherwise, we're glad we got them.
B00707B9AG|4|Easy install there is a slight whistle but only can be heard from the outside.
B011VNB75Q|5|Works great for my 84 yr old Mom.
B000VL9WS4|5|Hands down the best wrangler top!
B00VXZUABK|4|Easy installation but HUGH difference. Two screws held the old one, but use the new screws when you install.
B004I0WPBU|5|Delivered on time and it fits perfectly on my  97 4runner and adds more visibility to my old truck.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Super bright I actually installed them on my 2011 zx6r ninja I can see the road twice as far then with my stock lights
B00EE6VLG8|4|Bought this as gift for my husband. It was shipped fast and easy to install. Looks bright, very nice at night time. My husband called the fog lights running lights for day time. Not sure what that is. But over all he was pleased
B0031WGQ2K|5|Works great!
B004GMTYZ0|5|Awesome, cord long enough to get power to the backseat of my Jeep.
B006GR2C3O|5|I ordered this tire cover for the camper and everyone loves it! I called Tire Cover Central and they were very sweet. My order came in an orderly fashion!
B001KO713O|5|snap and go looks good
B00T82C0BS|5|The best air brake lock for any truck, in my case a Freightliner Cascadia. The yard where I park the truck is 50 miles away, and I would always worry about someone breaking into the truck and driving off with it (even with cameras and some security at the yard). Now there's no worry because no one can move the truck or any truck when the lock is over the air brakes. There's a real big danger when you're a solo driver, and pull into the fuel island to fill the tanks. Its happened to drivers before while they go into the truck stop to get coffee or the receipt, and come back out to the fuel island to find their rig gone. If you're in a real big hurry like UPS or FedEx, and forget to lock your doors but lock the air brakes, no one can drive off with your truck, except they might take your belongings.  Overall, the price is also very good comparing it to other places like dealers who might sell the same lock for double the price. Plus no shipping and tax fees which is also very good. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it 10. Make sure your truck is right where you left it. Be safe!
B000182EXC|5|Perfect fit. Easy to install. Works wonderful and looks great.
B0055PD1H4|5|Works great!! Used on my 07 Avalanche faded cladding and made it look mew. Now to see how long it lasts.....hmmmm
B000C2CI42|5|Perfect Fitment and high quality gaskets
B00BCRMAR6|5|the pieces are compatible with  chery Arauca 2014?
B008E0XNKC|5|Burnt my original Catalytic Converter due to a rich fuel mixture caused by a faulty MAF. Decided to go with the magnaflow and so far it doesn't disappoint. No noticeable sound difference, but that all changed once I put on my super 44 flow master. My little 2.7 sounds like a beast now. Anyways, it was a direct fit, and super easy to install. This went on a Tacoma.
B0006301M8|5|It's good hose.  It looks nice and the added protection of the stainless steel mesh is great peace of mind.
B002P8X8FE|4|worked great
B000PCBHD2|5|BEAUTIFUL PLATE!!
B00C3OCISI|4|Good quality. Just as written
B003LS15XY|5|I purchased this for my 2011 Hyundai Elantra. It fit perfectly!<br />Simply open your air filter box, remove paper filter, and place the replacement filter inside. Close up air box.<br />Remember to use the stickers provided in box, so the dealer or service center knows this is a K&N and does not  throw it away or try and get you to buy a new paper filter.<br />That's all there is to it!<br />Very happy with K & N filters, it's all we use in all of our vehicles! Saves me money and my vehicles run great!
B00NY5NWJY|4|Close match. Definitely worth the money compared to the OEM part at over $100. I'm attaching a picture of the fob on top of the Saphire Blue.
B00I4YTB5Y|5|This helmet is ausome worth every dime .
B00COU0Q8U|5|Fit great heavy duty
B001XVEM22|4|79 honda trail battery.  Connections did not seek as well as the battery I was replacing but they are holding right.  Ships with enough acid to fill.  Will buy again at this price point
B0001CMUV4|5|Works well and is simple to install.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Size wise it's not as big a other car trash bags I've owned in the past, but love the included tissue box insert. Now I know where my tissue box is at all times without having to look around (near the footrest of the front passenger seat, in the back seat, under the drivers/passenger seat, near the arm rest, in front of the rear window, etc). Normally I just keep my tissue box under the glove box near the front passenger footrest, but seeing a lot of friends and family go in my car as of late, the box has been passed around and hard to keep track of from time to time.<br /><br />The trash bag itself has slightly larger space if you were to put another tissue box inside of it. I personally just use it to store nick-nacks, cables, sunglasses and usb car chargers/accessories in it, so it frees up space in my glove compartment for important documents. I actually prefer the size as it's easy to blind grab items in it without having to stick my arm all the way in.<br /><br />Installation is easy, it holds itself in place by a Velcro strap hanging from the headrest of the passenger or driver seat. Also great for kids if they want to put their personal belonging in there so they know where it is in the future, instead of looking in between their seat lining or under the driver or passenger seat.
B00W63X0LA|5|Bought this as a gift. The recipient LOVED it. They get great comments wherever they leave their keys or when someone spots their keys!
B00KMKWUSS|4|Good fitment, finish and appearance.
B006DB0RZS|5|Great part works great
B005PYIT0Y|4|Fits pretty dam well looks great! No damage done while it was being shiped only thing that sucks is your factory screws will not fit to bolt down you're cluster gage the holes on the new light fit the cluster gage are to big other then that its amazing! !and fit the price great job and got here alot faster then it said it would i received it 2 days later great job guys.  If you can make those 2 holes to fit factory bolts your stuff would be on point!!
B0064BK8SI|5|Great quality
B008ITZ6F4|1|First off, it isn't as bright as pictured, and what caused me to actually write this review, is that this is just a black plastic frame that they have attached a piece of blue tape to...not professional looking at all, find a better quality piece.
B00HUME0JI|2|Ok quality.  Should come with a storage bag considering the price. All the videos I've seen on this says fits nice and snug. The videos show it staying up without the assistance of your sun visors. But the one I got looks more like a universal fit. Doesn't stay up against the glass which it what it needs to do if it's going to help with heat. It's not as reflective as other brands more of a Simi reflective surface almost satin finish. Also the back has a really thin felt back not a caddy like quality like another buyer claimed. There are other brands that fit much more snug. So Covercraft needs to go back and check there measurement on the Chevy trucks because this is definitely not a Customer fit. This appears to fit a number of different vehicles. So if your wanting a custom for a 2015 Chevy Siverado crew cab this is not it.
B006RNSGZK|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B005LGTSMO|5|Had repaired broken wiring harness numerous times.  Glad to have a new harness.  I did have to use some of the pieces from the old harness to secure the new harness.
B00I25Z8MA|5|Love it!!!!!!!!!!<br />Marvin the Martian is my favorite.
B0047CIN42|3|It has good magnetic power, and also because of that.. its pretty hard to put on...
B003POLA84|4|This clay is an excellent value, I feel. It cleans well and is easy to work with. The only thing I don't care for is how soft and sticky it can get when it gets hot. I am sure this can be mitigated, but it was a mess after the piece I was working with sat in the sun for a few minutes between steps on my last detail. I would still buy it again, but something to be aware of.
B002WIDEJC|5|We were very satisfied with lens and product came on time as needed for a race my husband entered and his other lens was all sratched
B00CS7T0IQ|5|GREAT ITEM
B008Y9K3TW|5|I'm very satisfied with the service and the items I bought .thanks very  much.. awesome service
B00M0XWZEO|5|This was for a friend of mineAnd he loved it
B00136OJZ2|3|not very bright
B00WZZ3MKI|3|The look is great, came with no instructions though and we cant figure out how to install. there is now diagram no screws nothing just the bar... Guess there's a reason its cheaper than others.
B00TGOOFIY|5|good as discribed
B009VJ7R4S|5|Got rid of my plate vibration. Mounted it on the back of the plate and on the back of my car
B00IHAAGAE|4|Wish the brackets were a little bit wider. Otherwise, functions as expected.
B00MMPDUXA|3|Everything fit fine except the springs had to use my old ones
B0042AJGFO|5|Worked perfectly and got Herr quickly.
B00BGSF92E|4|Great product for cleaning automotive parts, but not as powerful as I remember. I suspect environmental protection law have changed the formula. I used Hydro Seal in the late 60's and you had to be careful how long you left some items to soak. When you soaked a carburetor it came out looking brand new. I still think it cleans better that other product you can purchase to day for your home garage.
B0015Y80U2|5|Fits perfectly.  I have an older Duo Therm air conditioner on my RV and this cover fits exactly right.
B000HBM564|5|reliable, perfect for model aircraft
B0006NCGM6|5|worked great, no problems
B000J46PTW|5|I've had one of these for my other car for 20 years, and it's still good! This one perfectly fits my 2011 Mazda CX7. Highly, highly recommended, it keeps my car much cooler! Yeah, it's a little more expensive than other shades, but it's definitely worth it!
B00BZO4P1K|5|Thank you!
B0038KVOZE|5|Quality product at a great price.
B00ANNWEYO|5|Fast delivery! Item exactly as described. Fits my 2003 Ford Escape. Complete package with screw and rubber. Installation took around 10 minutes. Wish they'd come in pairs (with lower price) so both hinges will look new. Happy!
B005UGJSTS|5|Used on a ktm 50 pro sr sx. Fit great
B002TWVLU0|5|Thank you!
B00UEMH5L6|5|Easy to install took maybe 10 minutes.. Looks great!.. Will definitely protect the Radiator..
B0081ZVBDQ|5|good product
B000C57MMM|4|Fixed the ride problem. Super difficult to install. Had to take apart almost the entire front end
B0006JLU1I|5|these work perfect, always carry a spare
B00KTHWHEQ|5|Key works great on my 2010 Nissan sentra. Locksmith had to cut and program it, but it works great no issues.
B000O51VJ0|5|This works very well, and easy to use.  This summer has been hot and everywhere I have camped has had a burn ban.  Most of the time this type of propane campfire is allowed.  This lets us have a campfire without hauling wood, kindling, etc.  Also one of my friends has asthma and she loves this because there is no smoke.  Need a small propane tank to use it.
B007RP5OWU|3|only fixed 1/2 problem,  switch works just fine
B00IT5GU3Y|5|I like the product, as described.
B00ONH9EDA|5|Arived on time the pump made no sounds when key was turned on. At first i didn't think it was working but truck started up. Very good.
B00LHT3G54|4|Looks great. The cover needs to be a half inch longer on all sides.
B00GS0O3DG|5|Nice shirt.
B000P6WQB0|5|Fantastic
B0002JMF9I|4|Worked great.
B00AYZB6Z4|5|I bought this and mounted it on the bumper of my expedition. It was easy to install and works great.
B000ETQMIQ|5|My husband is an &uuml;ber driver and needed a good looking garbage can. This fit the bill perfectly 😃
B005H12QBS|4|Passenger side shakes alot while driving even though fully secured to door.
B009F590L6|5|Holding up nicely.
B00P0LB2OC|5|It works

B004Z0VC9O|5|Love it
B003CGH13S|5|the top was very easy to install and looks great.  It is a little noisy on the highway but still a great top.
B00DEQOTLI|5|Best thing ever!
B00F5MUB66|5|Works great really improves water pressure.
B00N48H3A0|5|This emblem looks great on my Suburban.  Good quality too.
B009FU5LYG|5|Good ..
B004RGOS24|5|Superb product. I wanted to polish up my Italian leather set for an occasion; this product didn't disappoint. Sofa set looked brand new when both cleaner & conditioner products were used.
B00JBQFVBM|5|Works great. Use plastic tube to the bottom of drain pan to keep oil form splashing up out of the pan when 1st draining
B00QMVKIEO|5|People can't believe it's a wrap that you apply over the Chevy bow tie.  Easy...took less than 15 minutes
B00803BESQ|5|these are ok but make sure you secure them well or they will fall off
B0016HNVAM|5|Good sale
B00L0O4OZM|4|Very comfortable, soft ride, much better than my old seat. No problem with installation at all. Very happy.
B00FALVU8A|5|No problems with this order.No problems with this order.

B007H9ZSFO|4|just what I needed and much cheaper than the dealer
B000WEMJ5I|5|Outstanding fit and finish!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of item.
B001IZKDZS|5|Much nicer than expected!  Fits beautifully on our 8 foot popup.
B004C6OBBC|5|Arrived on time and was as advertised.  Good price.
B005XOYZJ0|5|Excellent product ..great fit...<br />The one i bought before fell off and broke...I bought waterproof double side tape this time .I put all over old mirror before sticking new one on...awesome!<br />This item fits 1999 cad deville  or concorse
B00348B6TY|5|cool!
B002ZBWKAU|1|This is terrible bought it for my wife's car and straight out of the box couldn't get it to pump any air or even turn on.  I tried it in 3 different vehicles to no avail.  It is no good
B001AJH1HK|5|Second pair I've owned, and they continue to work great.
B004NFXA7I|2|WARNING! Road contaminants can turn aquapel into an opaque, hazy film. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it worked for 3 months before turning into a nightmare.<br /><br />I used aquapel on my glass when I bought it about 3 months ago. At first it worked great. I mean great! Bugs wiped right off, no problem with rain. I had just installed Bosch Icons wiper blades for $50. All good.<br /><br />Fast forward to last week, at the end of a long road trip I drove through an agricultural area where it was windy and the farmers were irrigating their crops and, I assume, treating their crops with some sort of fertilizer, herbicide, or pesticide as the mist left a clear oily residue on my car.<br /><br />Then I washed my windshield at a gas station after I was through it, and when I washed my windshield the aquapel turned into a complete haze and has been near impossible to clean off, and my windshield wipers turned grayish white, cannot be cleaned even with 90% isopropyl alcohol, and they skip horribly. At this point I think it will be more efficient to replace the windshield + wipers. I've already spent a couple hours on it and the car is still undrivable at night.<br /><br />Aquapel did say that oil can cause this, something like diesel exhaust from big trucks or other environmental factors, and agreed to send me some cleaning materials, but this is ridiculous! I had no idea that aquapel could turn into a mess on the windshield during a gas stop and that I wouldn't be able to continue driving without cleaning for an hour and still not get it clean.
B00GD6N8K4|5|Perfect fit, easy install.  They look great and add a nice premium touch to an already sexy interior!
B004NFXA7I|5|If you have never tried aquapel on your windshield you should. I once drove from Rochester to Syracuse at night, in a heavy rain storm, and never had to turn on my wipers as at high speeds the water just blows of the windshield. I have been using this product for about five years and it is great. My windshield wipers also last longer
B000IZ0B0G|5|Great stuff help me a lot
B000BZG6NE|4|Awesum delivery time &  price. Product worked as expected... Wife is very happy
B005FKV158|5|Perfect Fit, had everything I needed to complete the instal as well as instructions on how to break them in. I've had them on for a month now and they are working perfectly. They claim they stop better than OEM, I'd say marginally better, noticeable but not a throw you out of your seat improvement. The best part is they don't stick, squeal, pulse, or make any noise as you let off the brake from a complete stop, even on an incline.
B007ZD1SZG|4|For the most part they fit well. There are some spaces present on the sides that I wish would be sealed up. I have these for a sugary legacy and a ford f-150 and they are seamless, seems that there was a bit of a quality control issue on the mazda laser cutting.
B000CPJMCU|5|worked great, did exactly what I had  hopped .
B009D6AA8E|4|Good for looks
B007TN15EG|5|I was really on the fence about ordering this thing because of the price but I am so impressed with it! I always dreaded having to do double flares and the traditional double flaring tools only seemed to last me about half a dozen flares before I would break something or threads would begin to start stripping out on the tool. Not to mention there would always be that one flare that something didn't line up and it would screw up and leak and it always seemed to be on the line with the most complex bends. Now I can say those days are hopefully over!! Made a couple flares using scrap tubing and am just amazed how simple and fool proof this tool is.<br /><br />I wish I could remove just half a star though for a few small issues though. The tool came with no shrink wrap or any kind of sealing and when I opened it I found missing dies. I was pretty upset at first until I discovered they worked their way out of their spots and fell into the case where the instructions are. Luckily I heard them rattling around before I fired off a email. Also wish the instructions had a diagram explaining what all was in the case instead of just a list with part numbers. There are a couple spots for dies that I guess don't come with it because in the product description picture, the free tubing cutter is sitting on top of the spot they should be. Also wish the instructions were a bit more complete in general.
B00G8P3NRS|5|You can't go wrong with waterfowl decals!

B00979MIQ4|5|Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.
B001R8ZS6A|5|My niece loves it.
B007TY026M|1|Product was the wrong thing and had to be shipped back no replacement was offered
B005HR1V3G|4|Taillight seems to be a pretty good quality item. The only negative is the smoked tint is different color from the smoked turn signal covers, slightly bluish color. It came with two different plugs and some dielectric grease.
B003T1FSJA|5|Works great; I've been using Zerust capsules for 3 years now.
B007MC25Z2|2|Wanted to love the item.  Bought when I was out of town visiting and didn't open until I got home only to discover that the velcro that secures them to the seat belt was not properly sewn and it's pass the return day.  Poor QC.
B00JOPKOMG|5|Perfect!!!
B000DEN3PM|5|Nothing but greatness for my bike, so what else do I need to buy, does and exceeds what the others call what this product does but 6 to 7 times better, and for the price, i'm definitely a customer for life!! Thanks team keep up the awesome job!!
B00YB2B7QE|4|They are nice and b right
B0001MQ7A4|5|Boom just started overnight driving this thing is awesome! My wife makes me pre made-up casserole type meals in the tins (found@the Walmart for $1 for 4...) it heats my meal in like 20 min... (not going into my technique it needs to be up to the chef lol) I just keep like four or five meals pre made in a plug in cooler and bam no more expensive and time consuming fat gaining fast food that makes you stop in half hour to get rid of. .. if you know what I mean. .. after all miles are cash. .. if your gone along time on the road I'd get a crock pot to make a big batch of whatever. ... any way ty I hope this helps!
B009S9RXGI|5|Perfect!!! Love it! Just as described
B000AL8VD2|4|good
B00HVV60HI|5|WiFi connects each time I have used this and it has never lost the connection either in the drive way or driving.<br />Mainly use it with DashCMD, but have also tried UUAID and a few others with no problems.<br />I am very happy I did not write this off due to the cost and go with the $99 WiFi units.<br />Saved some money and I am very happy with the scanner.
B00WTOKR5I|1|Does not fit properly. The shop couldn't even get it installed. Tried calling this company multiple days throughout the day several days never answered.
B00QYNXMPC|5|As described...  Would order again!
B00V56U28I|1|It is not able to purify the interior,wrong product for cars.
B006EFUMEE|5|Got the part quick and it made the steering complete. Thanks for the part.
B00T40ZIZY|5|The 80cc Motors allow you the chance to really restart your scooter. The GOOFIT Kick Start Rebuild Kit For Scooter certainly makes it possible for you to spend more time on those dirt roads. You want to make sure you understand how this kick start can impact your ability to back track and also find certain levels of speed. The motors are very easy to change out, and potentially fill with fuel. Sparkplugs are something that can be changed as well if you are having trouble with a 50cc motor.
B0060KLI64|5|Was exactly as advertised. Very simple to install.
B00FTAYJ4Y|5|Great product, fits the car perfectly..Will continue to buy from this seller.
B003KS59WI|1|UPDATED REVIEW:  the metal clip broke. I really liked this lanyard too. The strap part of this seems like a good quality. I definitely wasn't expecting the metal part to go before the strap 😔  When I opened the package, the lanyard was rolled up in a little ziplock bag, and when I went to unroll it, some of the letters were stuck to each other. I carefully pulled it apart. It was really stuck together, but didn't really damage the lettering too bad.
B00A49DELY|4|Good
B004N5WHE0|5|Works well
B00027GZV4|3|My worst fear came true the pulley rubbed when installed but it's a simple fix find longer bolts add lock washers behind the pulley although the.  5/16x24 hex bolts aren't common I found allen bolts instead.
B003CGH13S|5|Fit rite on, nice and tight.  Fast shipping.  Happy customer.
B0007TQWME|3|tear easily
B00OBRC2V8|5|My boyfriend bought this for me. I got it today and I love it. I looks great and fits very well.  It is super is to put it on the steering wheel feels very comfortable. It has rubber inside the cover so it will not slip.
B005L13NZM|3|pretty cheaply made for the price, but anything made for motorcycle convenience is overpriced in my opinion.
B009FUF6DM|5|Works as advertised
B0027M3A1U|3|Worked well but not much different than the $12.00 name brand washes out there.
B003VASR9C|5|Great buy for lifted fj, made a bracket to go in rear over oem area
B006X152SU|5|Very soft leather. I just put a plastic liner , (a plastic tub from staples) in the bag so it retains its shape.
B00NWT69Z6|4|It was physically lighter than the radiator cap it replaced, but it seems to be working fine.
B00A80EVXO|5|I bought 2, front and back of car.  Very visable and stuck to the car quite well. When I don't have them on the car, they are stuck on the side of the fridge until needed.
B0072HRDK4|4|First order was missing parts! Amazon was quick as always to fix the problem!<br />The moldings look and feel like like a quality kit! I will update this after a year in the AZ desert and see how it holds up.
B00RCKFG4G|1|Terrible to part. Put it on and for 2 weeks couldn't figure out what was wrong with truck. This part ended up costing me hundreds and by the time I figured out it was bad and to late to get my money back.
B000WL9HI8|4|I use this on my sunporch. Looks good and is pretty accurate.
B003MD3TKK|5|I got these for my bike. I love them--very sharp.
B0016J61CK|5|Great product.  Working great.
B00OSDI4TY|5|PERFECT key chain for the Mustang lover
B00O2BZC92|5|Quick shipping, great high quality decal at a great price.
B000EOJ05S|3|fit like oem
B00503PT5I|2|its ok muffler seams rusting and leaks.<br />Junk will not buy dynomax products again . Should of returned it when I saw low grade muffler
B003WP30XO|4|Craftsmanship looked good but the axle was too long for my 2001 Rancher 350 2x4 ES.  Return was simple and convenient.
B00Q3DNZ2I|5|What can you say about some connectors that hasn't already been said? The leads were a nice quality and gauge, stripped and soldered well.
B0002AJR8E|3|ok
B00XPL88NC|5|This is a gauge that I simple like and will know where it is in my car at all times and I know how to use this one. The TireTek tire gauge can be used on a car, truck or another device that would air place into it. The tubing is flexible and easy to read and any angle. This is does not take glasses to read you can read from and direction. It fits in the door of my car where I can find it for use it is small but durable.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review.
B007245A48|5|just like stock very nice
B009M1VO6C|5|I didn't realized how small the lights will be. For some strange reason, I thought it was about 6-7in but it's only 3-4. But it works and that's the most important thing. But actually, smaller like this size is nice to hide inside the car.
B008213AU6|5|Good price

B00H1KTXH8|3|Its thick and hard to manage. You only have enough to get one shot at each headlight, so don't buy unless you're experienced with using tint and vinyl. I am experienced, had all the right tools, heated to stretch it and found it to get seams pretty easily. Its not forgiving and it loses all adhesive if you try to wet it. Needless to say, I didn't get it right on the first try so the rest of the roll was wasted. For some reason there were 2 led cabin lights for my truck included in the roll instead of the magazine pictured, and they were an unexpected surprise! I'd give the lights 5 stars, but the tint is &#34;eh&#34;...
B000BQW5LK|5|for the price, Good quality and fast shipping !
B005CDSWX2|5|Fits my 2006 Scion tC. The engine light didn't turn off. I may need something to reset it.
B00OU6NZGQ|5|Love it
B004H4ALIQ|4|No fuss, no mess. Keeps the drinks cold but No ice melting all over the van.
B0064GVXL4|3|It's just an OK product. I gave it a 3-star because it's better than nothing. Very flimsy and small but I purchased it with low expectations from reviewing other buyers feedback.
B006NZTZLQ|5|Works Great! I use it in conjunction with the torque app on my Galaxy S5 and I have so far been able to use it for a couple check engine lights that have popped up. Easy to use and easy to setup.
B00OLXVM8G|2|Fitment issue on the left front mud guard.
B0041FBSEW|5|Thank you!
B00X8UYLJU|5|This thing is amazing. The box felt like it was just filled with packing peanuts. It fit perfectly into my BMW G650 xMoto without any need for a foam spacer (though, it came with one anyway). My bike now cranks faster even than when it was brand new.
B0009V1WS4|5|As advertised.  Inexpensive.
B00AWYBKK8|1|I bought two red ones, and one of them turned orange within a year.
B007DE60BE|5|If you have ever been to Disney World, you know this castle. I have it on the door window of my camper. Looks great. Very easy to install. I get a lot of complements on Cinderellas Castle!
B00CM57YEQ|4|Love these. Thicker than the blue microfiber towels. However, Nano Towels are even thicker. But still think these are great. Nanos are expensive. These are economical.
B00KO3P9WM|3|Excellent quality material, but latch was very heavy & difficult to work with.
B00APO8JOU|5|Looks great on the back of my sons Mustang. Solid metal contruction!
B000EJ4UO4|5|works great, low dust, no fade
B000W7TF1Q|5|Easy to install and secure. Nice to keep the windows cracked open in this heat and have to worry about a stray shower.
B00PARU8NC|5|Really nice construction and went on exactly as indicated in the instructions.  The dark smoke color of the material is almost invisible against the hood of my black truck.  Would definitely buy again...
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great quality and good price!
B00U7DYECU|1|Ordered these for my 99 mustang fog lights, they actually worked really good which surprised me because the seller said mainly for looks. i gave the product 1 star because even though they fight my car one of them wasn't made correctly and big enough to lock into the harness and while i was driving it fell.
B000F6DNMQ|5|Ordered 3 of these & they work great!
B003W8P1C4|5|Very Satisfied!
B00NTOJU28|4|Very bright lights.  But not can bus compatible so you may get a error message ?
B0040D2REU|3|Not the same quality as the original equipment, so I haven't installed them yet.
B008B5X5GC|5|bought these as the mechanics wanted double the price if I went through them...my tire sensors had gone bad after just 6 years, so I tried online and found these through Amazon for a much cheaper price....took them into my mechanic and he installed them and they work great....Amazon had them delivered quickly and free of course as I am a prime member....Awesome find!
B0044A3RX4|4|Thorough and helpful
B000ET525K|4|Put this in the tool kit of my motorcycle and hope I never need it.  Have used this product in the past with my other motorcycle and worked great
B00GR8M0VG|5|This is a good buy
B006OQ35GU|5|This item is SIMPLE and INDISPENSABLE. To be able to see the progress of this basic operation that all campers must complete is, in my mind, an absolute necessity. Don't leave home without one.
B0006O2PJ4|5|I love this item
B000YJ5GOM|5|Thank you!
B00CF7400C|5|Exellent
B001TLJK2I|5|Thank you!
B003PYWXSK|5|fits almost perfect....but hoped it to be well customized for the part which is cut off for the  rearview mirror. I am not complaining, just my 2 cents.
B0097FGY9A|5|I received these in great time and they look fantastic on my Accord !
B005N6Z2BI|5|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. It's his favorite shirt. :)
B000EQATU6|5|I bought this part along with the sway bar link for the opposite side so I could replace both parts at once. One had already failed and the other looked to be close to failing so it was necessary to replace both in my opinion.These parts seem to be much sturdier and better designed than the OEM parts so I am very happy with them. Installing both parts took very little time (the toughest part was getting the old parts off because of some poor design choices - allen keys were needed but the holes were rusted and proved difficult to use). I am extremely happy with both parts and in the end I was able to save a few hundred dollars by doing the install on my own instead of bringing it to a repair shop (I was quoted around $250 by three separate places while both parts cost about $60 in total).
B002QS3F9C|4|works fine
B00G620ZVU|5|I mounted 4 of these to my 2012 RZR, 2 front, 2 rear, and they are super bright and seem to be pretty well made.
B00QOJW62Q|3|not the best choice to mount to a 2015 Sportsman 570. you will need to purchase rubber spacers or cut up the black plugs. This did not meet my expectations for the price.
B003VLBPJA|3|The hooks are so small, I am not sure how much it will work for what I needed it for...
B009R6ZNV4|5|It works
B00HD9V5L4|5|Awesome!!
B00MXAA9MY|5|works great
B002ESEMXC|4|This pad does not fit my 1999 Dodge Dakota as the fit check says. Other than that the pad seems fine I just can't do anything with it.
B008G2TPGE|5|Headlights arrived quickly and were exactly as described and pictured. They installed easily and quickly. My son installed them using the wiring harness already in the jeep. About 10 mins installation time.<br />My jeep looks beautiful.
B00OWS4U6G|5|Installation went well. I did it by myself in less than 30 minutes. Cover fits tight and is square on my truck. Snaps shut very tightly. Velcro holds it in place very well. The cross bars are attached to the vinyl top with vinyl tabs. I am a bit concerned how long those will last because the bars are quite heavy. So far so good. Rolling the top open and closed goes well even with just one person.<br /><br />Notes:<br />- Installs in 30 minutes with one person<br />- Fit my bed perfectly<br />- Closes tightly.<br />- Looks great.<br />- Rolls up quickly with one person.
B00YD2HN7O|5|I Love it,  will order more other stuffs soon.
B00D7TD7VU|4|It arrived very late, but I do like it. Wish it was metal but it's a very hard plastic.<br />It will work though.
B005C5BWUU|3|Mine was obviously used and had scratches and chipped. They need to be a bit more descriptive and tell people if they are used or new. I'm still satisfied.
B0012PO4YK|2|IT says it fits the 2004 yukon denali on the amazon fitment...it doesn't. the circular eyebolt bottom is completely different than the two piece bottom
B00FALVU8A|4|gave my car a great shine.  Very easy to put on and take off, by no means and i am professional, after i watched the short video and how to was your car videos on youtube i gave this a try and it was a breeze to work with.  i would buy this product over and over again.  I love the way it looked afterwords and have gotten many compliments on how great it is.  When i was done my car had that great shine that we all love.  it made my black car look even better then it did when i bought it brand new
B00AZ4TU98|1|Tried doing my research in ur site & I was for sure that the item was right, but when I tried putting it on my Trk, it wasn't the correct item, sorry but have to sent it back pops.
B00NIHOZP8|5|Good product, good service.
B008QDXADW|5|Its either works or it doesnt. Its a respected brand. I use it in my Mitsubishi which has over 200000km on it. The expected benefits are the added detergents to help keep it clean.
B002307LZM|5|I got this tube for my 03 DRZ/KLX 400 (front tire). It fits well, and is slightly thicker then the original. Holding up so far.
B00Y5G5NMU|1|Didn't fit when I searched using the car search thing. Tried to return and there's a like 25% re stocking fee and they wanted pictures to prove it doesn't fit.
B012BKOHO6|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesign.1608459247
B000CAXRVW|1|This spacer is a GIANT piece of crap. Has scratches in the mating surace as well as a hairline fracture that leaks oil when warm. Will not be buying Beck arnley again.
B007D7QOH6|5|Works as anticipated and great replacement part!  Easy to install .
B00HUEFROS|5|works well.
B0066CGLS6|5|Satisfied!
B003CJLSSO|3|Fit bunches around head not the best quality
B0068ERZ14|5|I had one for my seat so I picked this up for my wife for our trip down south.  She loved it. The air flowed through the pad's mesh and kept her cool the entire 2300 mile trip in 95-105 deg heat.
B000NJSHNK|1|When I first put these on the eyelets on both boots popped out and the zipper on one failed. F__K China!!
B00496S9BI|5|Very good
B000GKJKGE|1|I initially gave this lock a bad review because it would not work with the original bolt.  It is designed to work with the included screws and washer, not the original bolt.  I then improved the review because I read the instructions. After trying to use it the first time I found that it actually does not work with a 2004 GMC Sierra 1500.  It just jams the latch. Give it a good tug and the tailgate opens, locked or on locked.  You cannot shut the tailgate unless you remove the lock, and put it back on.
B0036FKGCS|3|It's decent
B003FBV8ZW|5|Nice fitting
B00GXP6TK6|5|Great during the day. Good at night with street lights.
B00KTHXN1M|5|OEM keyfob...as described.  Works great!!
B001P1036O|5|hooked up with factory plug in just as advertised, took 5 min to install, workd great on ram 1500 4wd, with dual axle rv, would buy again
B00OU1SQB0|2|With some thinking I made it work but definitely not the part I was looking for . No vacuum line ? Those who have the bike will understand . Dont waist your time .
B00IAHCH8I|5|Nice feel to it as well as weight, doesn't burn your hand in the sun, I like it!
B00EDS112Q|4|Fixed the problem, would not idle without the choke on, got this kit, installed it and the bike is running properly again. I tried cleaning the old jets but must not have done that right as that did not help.  Great kit with all you need.
B0002Q7C1C|1|Ordered the part that i needed for my SUV to tow my camper. I plugged it into the vehicle and nothing happened with my camper.  I bought a tester and the terminals at the vehicle work but the adapter doesn't. I know I bought it in March but with life sometimes you don't get around to things in a timely fashion.  Looking on line today then looking at the adapter closely it only has 3 wires attached to the 4 prong and 4 loose wires instead of only 3.  Not even the correct harness as the picture or description now Im stuck with a useless harness that is going to take way more time/work/money that I wanna spend.
B00COOSE6M|1|Both ballast lasted about a month.<br />I'm back to stock lights because I don't trust any of these products
B00B2AT2W4|4|Fit like it should.
B000KZUTCY|5|Easy to use. So far so good. Used to glue a fiberglass support on a motorcycle fairing. Working perfect.
B00BAOIS3Q|5|Great Product, great price
B00KQEHHPG|5|Good oil
B00BMY7Y84|5|We bought this to use as wall storage on a toy hauler conversion.  Works great.
B00D0E5166|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Honda CRV, highly recommend!
B001FAK28E|1|Not like the description, mirrors were very hard to assemble
B003ZJ1674|5|nice
B0043AV4NK|5|great muffler and fast ship
B004B61B34|5|heavy duty and fit the first time
B0065UN98Y|5|Good Quality. Motorcraft parts are the way to go for your Ford.
B00GWWULG8|5|these are great!!! very clean, perfect touch to my black and chrome Chevy avalanche! pretty sturdy and the adhesive tape seems to be sticking pretty well! got here really fast!
B004I6QA74|5|These wheel covers do a great my protecting my wheels from damaging weather conditions. The price is reasonable. The material seems to be of good quality so I am hoping to have them for a good while
B004BQ87YK|5|Easy to use and looks great!
B007CVSE30|1|This says it has a 1200 lb strength hold, my husband was able to rip apart the links with little effort
B001FMPP70|5|Perfect
B008G3KCHE|5|Not quite a piece of cake to install. Instructions would have been nice.
B000BUOSGQ|3|The thing doesn't stay closed very long because the tabs pop out.
B001KO0RQM|3|1 year later and these rotors are starting to show its age. I live in the northeast of the usa where we get lots of snow and salt, but I did not drive my car in the winter at all. They work ok, but had I known they would start to rust this quickly I would have opt for Oem rotors. They are however slightly better than the rotors you can get for cheaper (that I bought for my rears) at advanced auto or your local auto parts store. For my personal preference, I would opt for Oem rotors next time.
B0051ZHC3C|5|Great product price awsome will be buying more of this.
B00V30J86I|5|This is so neat. Keeps your purse in place, or anything else for that matter. Good price. Fast delivery.
B008L5J5G6|5|Just what I needed. This was exactly as described, all metal and took about 5 minutes to install. A month later and it still works great.
B001P4K1H2|3|These are heavy duty, good quality mounts but they don't fit 06 Kawasaki ZX14's as advised in the description. Needless to say, very disappointed.
B001CZODH8|5|Improved mileage I love this product I put in me an my wife's car.
B002XJ0ED4|5|Bought for a family member, no complaints as of yet.
B00WYTZ8B6|3|The plastic isn't tinted dark enough.  The picture is quite misleading, because the actual visor is nowhere near that dark.  It's also not as distortion free as some of the other reviews would have you believe, but it's acceptable for the price.  The flip-down clip has detents which allow you position the visor well, which is a nice feature.  I'll likely keep it, but will put a piece of window-tint on it to make it darker - as sold, this doesn't keep me from squinting when driving into the sun.
B0083P3YNE|1|Junk. Fell off at 60mph. Horrible customer service. I emailed for refund and never got a reply. Bs
B007GR4KMO|4|Wish I could take individual ones off but it does the job.  Perfect for cleaning jets.  I dissassembled my carbs and soaked them in sea foam for 2 days after wards I used this to make sure the jets where clean.  And then shot compressed air threw the jets to make sure no debris is left.
B0040CWY58|4|Just what i need it
B008N8INGE|5|if you off road you need this,
B000630D9Y|5|how can you beat the K&N?
B00FBKUF6I|5|They are great lights!! Easy install, look amazing, I'm more than pleased. I would recommend them to anyone
B005X97OHA|5|quick service. Very satisfied with my fridge. Its always nice to have a cold drink after doing outside activities. Absolutely love it.
B00FYI2FMO|5|I thought I had left your feedback.  Sorry!  These guys are the best they helped me the minute I called and went well beyond what they had to do to help me.  All I can say is the mechanic toyota mechanic by the way put the part on and the code cleared.  I am still having a problem with the van but it is not becasue of the part.  Very happy with the sellers and the purchase.  They save me a bunch of money.
B007ZLO1A2|4|direct fit for my ford freestar no mods needed.  Front end is like new again. If you can wait can def save some money getting here than at part stores.
B000C5O1VW|5|Exact replacement
B0002JMLQU|5|My mechanic recommended this additive because my transmission s running a bit rough. It seems to have helped.
B000C9QUFI|3|These now have a nylon core and fiber end caps instead of the steal core and steal end caps.
B0099QV9BU|4|My husband likes this product and won't use anything else in his Ford truck
B0039KQOBW|5|As advertised<br />Thank you
B00U2ADLW2|5|Worked
B00480KOP4|4|Upgraded the H11 bulbs on my wife's 09 Fusion to these with the well known H11 to H9 modification and honestly I can't really tell much of a difference.
B00CEPVM60|1|Did not fit. It seems a trunk shock was sent instead of a hood shock.
B00HP957RK|5|As described
B00DGC194K|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00BYVVTLS|5|Great product will use again
B000CSYQWI|5|Direct fit for my 97 Mercury Mountaineer.  Shipped sealed and came with the orings that you should be replacing on the lines.  I put a couple of ounces of pag 46 and quickly installed it.  So far so good.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Fuses arrived as expected in excellent condition. now I have spare fuses for me and my brother. Paying $5 for two fuses is too much at the local O'Reilly Auto store. Thank you !!!
B00XITA8I4|1|Item arrived a day later than promised.  Item was severely warped and bent. I wish I could give it 0 stars. For 70 dollars,  I expected more. Don't waste your time. This item is going back
B00EV9231U|5|Installed in 10 minutes. Worked perfectly. Beautifully finished product. Kudos to throttlemeister.
B00OZVNKLQ|5|Worked perfect for my 90 Plymouth acclaim. V6. Easy installation. Take off one screw then pop old one and insert new one.
B008G1X0DO|1|not sealed properly. Water & moisture inside lens after 1st car wash,  Thank you for the refund,.
B002Z0X7MQ|4|minor fit issue on drivers side lens with bolts like others said, but if that bugs you pay more at dealer.
B00192JF9U|5|as described and fits
B002N1J5IM|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B0021UXUSQ|2|Its a waste of time and money , the blue light does not show up the uv dye much , the injector did not last long , the rubber got to soft and separated from the shaft
B00KYQQM5M|2|One of the 4 worked, good thing I only needed one...
B00GBRG4TC|5|Exact fit and great price.
B006DYI4DC|3|Not really made for 4runner, have to force them in.
B0024E68HO|5|It was everything that I expected, GREAT!
B0030EWA5G|5|Item was as described...genuine NISSAN part.
B001IH8Q0A|3|Play in the fit with the tow bar results in the bike rack moving up or bouncing did not fail but very unsettling
B005VUJY9W|1|Ordered this part as identified for a 1999 Chevy Silverado.  Took the time to research and verify that I was getting the right part with high quality instead of the cheaper, flimsy knockoff.  Guess what!  It didn't fit!  Very disappointed!
B002HZYLVK|5|great
B001PWA0IO|5|Easy to install, follow the instructions and you will have this installed in 15 minutes.  Love it!
B00ED46XHS|3|The product is fine. It only took a 1/2 year to deliver it.
B00BSCFETQ|4|Works as advertised, just too pricey for what it is.
B000S2QWSY|5|Nice wires
B009ET2UCO|4|Great bumper , directions are terrible . Make sure you put winch and bull bar on first then the bumper or you will be taking it back off . It can be done but it's a lot harder because you can't reach the bolts .
B008QDPVC0|5|Excellent
B00E6G5OM8|4|Nice, but the graphics are applied to the top of license frame (possibly stickers), I thought the letters were engraved.
B000C2CMDE|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B009NLMWT4|5|Received one of these with a purchase of the Dually lights from Rigid Industries and it worked great. I purchased another to mount with my non dually lights on my Polaris Ranger and it works great for keeping water and dust away from the connections on the back side.
B00068OL1A|4|It is a wax... Yes, a very good wax, I think I used it on my car, and it definitely held well, kinda like 300 Spartans facing an army of Persians or something
B005EZLBMC|5|handy as caution flags when I work on metal panels
B00L4NHW7Q|5|Really great mats.  They totally fit in my car (VW Beetle), didn't have to trim them down at all.  I think they look really nice and seem thick enough.  No bad rubber smell either.  I'm happy with these mats.
B0096EBQSG|5|Fit perfectly on 2006 X1500 ClubCar with Kubota 3 cyl diesel. Keep in mind: this alternator has a T-shaped two-wire connector, and in my case only one wire is hooked up. The same engine on my Kubota tractor has 3-wire connector, and all are used.
B00PQDUOSO|5|I put this on my Honda Forza(scooter) and it's just great!<br />however, I had to adjust the angle of the headlight.
B00SSPL76A|1|Wow. Talk about a waste of money and time installing this product. Once my turn signals were plugged in and I started the car I not only had no turn signals but no emergency flashers and I blew my fuses. Anzio is a company name I will avoid in the future for automotive products.
B00S09T8M4|5|I purchased 5 pcs of this cleaning cloth. Useful for cleaning my car and dusts in the house.
B00449AC9C|5|This thing is great. I toss it in my trunk and when I go to the car wash, I whip this out and it shines, dries and polishes all in one.
B000RXNLK6|5|Works well but no better than any quality detailer.
B009ZXCT7U|5|It's almost unreal how good this product is. I bought a glove leather sofa off Craigslist a while back, and while the leather is &#34;self-healing&#34; when it comes to scratches, it was looking rather worn (think broken-in baseball glove). One application of Chamberlain's and the sofa is - NO KIDDING - like new. I know it's bad for it, but I can't stop feeling how nice the leather is. Simply beautiful. The sofa looks brand new, and it hardly took any product at all to get it that way. I still have well over half a bottle left.<br /><br />Oooh - bonus - I bought a Michael Kors leather handbag at Goodwill that I inteded to flip on eBay. I used Chamberlains to take off some mild soiling and the purse looks fresh out of Macy's (so much so, I've decided to keep it for myself.)<br /><br />Thank you, Chamberlain's. I'll never use another leather cleaner again!
B00OU0L5VE|5|fits and works great.
B006WHQ5JA|1|only worked 2 days
B000637TNM|4|Good product!
B00A8136F2|5|It was exactly what I was wanting and the best price. So very happy with the quality of the product and it's sleek look.
B00RCEK39U|5|These things look great on my car and fit well...  they have a small rubber gasket on the inside...  only complaint is i did not receive my free gift.
B000FF76KM|5|Works just as directed.  I put in hot water and it melted right away.  Works as planned
B004VWKZTE|5|perfoect fit
B008G2306U|5|Perfect fit
B008YFIALY|5|Best upholstery and carpet cleaner I've ever used! It can practically take off any stains you have. Great price when you buy six at the same time.
B003JSO1X2|1|NOCO<br />Just my experience with this company. When I was specking out the stereo for my boat, I called the Company and explained to them what I wanted to do. Their response &#34;I'm sorry for the inconvenience Mr. Morris, the charger would think the battery isn't holding a charge if it's being drawn from while charging, and continue to attempt completing its charge cycle.&#34;<br />Are you serious? So their charger fried (3) Deep Gel Cycle Batteries that cost $279.00 EACH and they are &#34;Sorry for the inconvenience.&#34;<br />Super fantastic customer service. In helping me select the product, explaining to me why their product was superior and would be &#34;Perfect&#34; for my application, to shipping quickly,<br />The Genius is a well made product and I am sure performs when it is supposed to, just don't trust their customer support and seek additional clarification when it comes to your specific install - because you are on your own when your batteries are gassed out.<br />Thanks NOCO for teaching me a $800.00 lesson in negative customer support!
B000LOLWZW|5|Lost my old trailer hook one of those screw on carabiner type. This one is so much better wont fall off your safety line. Super strong and snaps on instead of screwing. Saving a lot of time. Nice product.
B000CN8W78|5|Part works great, good service!
B008OMG2UI|5|Very bright! Work great.
