Furthermore, it's message is utterly ambiguous- much less than what the veiwer deserves for putting up with its boorish crassness.  Skip this one!

B000J4QWNQ|1.0|This is a disappointing movie in a lot of ways. Colin Ferrel was poorly casted in the role and spends the entire movie looking like Yanni with his mustache and long hair. And you can tell he is trying to make his voice sound like Don Johnson to whole time.<br /><br />The story is very simple and could have been a one hour episode instead of a long drawn out feature film.<br /><br />Even though it's the same director that was associated with the original Miami Vice TV series, I feel he failed in making this movie. While there are some cool shots and action sequences, the movie is lacking in virtually every other aspect.

0393317552|5.0|The author puts forth an old question, why did the West \\"advance\\" so much ahead of the rest of the world.  The answer is surprising and perhaps the best explained answer to that question yet.  I will give you a hint: It isn't knowledge, or genes, or any other \\"higher\\" ability of the West.  Even those that claim not to enjoy history will enjoy this book and the ways it makes you think about the world.

I ordered the british version this morning, half because I couldn't wait for it until April, and I was scared Sigourney Weaver was the narrator for the American version. <br /> <br />FEAR NOT!!  The word on the street is that the American version of the series DVD's will feature BOTH the ORIGINAL DAVID ATTENBOROUGH NARRATION AND Sigourney Weaver's narration.  Phew... close one eh?  I thought BBC was going bonkers for a while there... Who prefers Sigourney Weaver to David Attenborough anyway?  I mean she's good for action flicks and stuff, but Dave can't be beat.

Instead they chose to put an orchestral version.  I do not know how they, at Virgin Records, let that happen, it seems an invitation to buy another disc.

0142000663|5.0|As much a political manifesto as the simple story of a family forced to leave their family farm and seek a new life in California, the Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature. Set in the American West at the start of the mass migration to the West Coast, the story follows the Joad family from the foreclosure of their farm through the long road trip along Route 66 and finally to their lives as migrant workers in a land overflowing with workers. Their lives and hardships are vividly painted in Steinbeck's outstanding prose.<br /><br />Steinbeck alternates styles each chapter. Every other chapter details the story of the Joads. In the remaining chapters Steinbeck uses a repetitive, haphazard, ungrammatical, absolutely brilliant style to sketch a scene from the life of a migrant family, ostensibly the Joads. In these chapters, he conveys scenes such as the high-paced action of a used car lot, the bitterness of a family receiving foreclosure notice, or the back breaking work of cotton picking with such clarity and color that the words of the book seem to fall away leaving the reader with a tangible world in which voices are shouting or the breeze is tossing the cotton tufts into the air. In my own reading, I've seen many authors try to mimic this unstructured, repetitive style, but never done as well as this.<br /><br />The story is rich with symbolism and emotion. While there are some spots where Steinbeck seems to be working too hard, the book as a whole is a wonderful read. You will come away a little more educated about that era in America's history, a little more sympathetic to the plight of migrant workers, and maybe even a little more left-leaning in your political views. Regardless of what you intend to get out of it, the Grapes of Wrath is absolutely recommended for anyone of the maturity to understand the deep themes that run through the story.
0393061310|5.0|Considering that the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" - when modern day human beings became fully physically and mentally equipped and developed language - occurred some 50,000 years ago in East Africa, and that all of those descendants spread from one origin, it is not unreasonable to consider environmental reasons as being the sole contributor to subsequent differences. Otherwise, what else would be the cause? Divine intervention? But the European colonists of the New World and other places such as Africa and the Far East had their own views. They assumed that differences in culture and technology were more than anything attributable to innate ability. The philosophy of survival of the fittest tended to promote that notion.     The author notes that we do not know for sure that there was one origin for modern humans. There could have been a parallel developments. That possibility as well as consideration for the speed of evolutionary changes leaves room for a case that biological differences could be a factor in explaining why some people in one region in one time period developed technology at a faster rate than other people in other regions. The author acknowledges that it is an open question as to how much of an effect geography or environment has had on human development. One very persuasive element for him concerns his considerable experience with primitive type people in New Guinea. His work with the natives there leads him to believe that those people have a practical intelligence which is as high or higher as other more advanced people.     As an excellent example of an incident of common origination in human history, the author cites the Polynesian people and their settlement of a wide expanse of Pacific islands before any other external influence. Here we can see the strong influence of environment within a smaller geographic scale than the entire world. The Polynesians, who settled on the largest and richest islands, developed the most advanced societies.    The book compels the reader to think about how the geography of the largest land masses -the Americas, Euroasia, Africa, and Australia - influenced technological development and spread of power and influence. The fact that the Fertile Crescent was a home to an extravagant number of big-seeded wild grains was a big reason why it became the locus for the first known food production. Other places in the world well suited to farming, such as Central Valley in California, did not have the same wealth of wild, domesticable plants, and therefore were not farmed until much later. The rise of farming allowed specialization, and the geography of Euroasia allowed a east-west spread along a favorable climate zone. Also, Eurasia contained more domesticable animals, much than on the other land masses. All of these favorable factors allowed Eurasia a huge head start in the ability to invent new technologies and thus spread its influence.      Beyond controversy, this book has a wealth of information concerning geography, climate, linguistics, archeology, evolution, and technology; and it has fascinating facts concerning the history of human adaptation to the environment. For example, there are only two places in the history of the world - Mesopotamia sometime before 3000 B.C and the Mexicans sometime before 600 B.C - where writing is known for certain to have originated. A number of interesting questions are answered at least in part: such as, why were oak trees never domesticated for their acorns, whereas almonds, which are toxic in their natural environment, were?
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is a new brand of Bond, more shaken than stirred, as he portrays a more human 007. He's more edgy and realistic in my opinion. I slightly miss the larger than life 'super-suave' Bond, but I finally admitted that the more human hero is refreshing. So happy that they were wise enough to cast Judi Dench again as 'M'. I don't believe a Bond movie would be as good without her screen dominating personality. There's a few 'near-death' scenes that I especially liked this time around.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

After the first viewing I loved it, then I didn't watch it for a week.  However, this past week it has been part of my nightly ritual. I watch chapters of the DVD.

B00005JPAM|4.0|The message of this movie is to be found in its quiet moments. It is in the silent angst of a woman torn between her personal convictions and public obligations. It is in the graceful and dignified demeanor of a queen, despite the battles that rage within her. You would not know it to look at her, and that's precisely how she would have wanted it, lest you should think her to be some heartless monarch.     The Queen's(Mirren) initial decision to refrain from making any public statement after Princess Diana's death was as much rooted in protocol as it was in a personal grudge. Why should the monarchy make an official statement on behalf of a lady who was no longer the Princess of Wales? Moreover, why should she have to acknowledge a woman who made a mockery of her family? Lost in her own world of justifications, she waits for the hysteria to die down and the public to \\"come around\\"; but they never do. The newly elected Tony Blair(Sheen) serves as a barometer for public opinion to the monarch and coaxes her ever so gently to address Diana's death in a statement, especially with the media quick to disapprove of her stoic disposition. However, Blair, a keen observer, is also mindful of her internal conflict and respects her all the more when she finally makes a decision to appease the English people despite her own misgivings.     The British Monarchy has always lived in the shadow of Diana's popularity, a friction that was brought to surface with the tragic incident. If this movie is a propaganda, then it is a good and well deserved one; at least Her Majesty has finally found a level playing field with the \\"People's Princess\\". No, the Queen would not have you believe her to be some heartless monarch, but a wise woman who has endured countless administrations throughout the decades, and in doing so, has realized that the demands of her people are more important than her own, even if her appeasement ultimately came at the eleventh hour. Mirren's acting is controlled andcontemplative, as it should be, Micheal Sheen lacks presence and the motley cast that surrounds them are forgettable. Considering that more than three-fourths of screen time is devoted to Mirren, the weak supporting cast is not a mitigating factor to the overall excellence of the film by any means.      P.S. This may not be the true representation of what went on behind Buckingham Palace in 1997, but it paints a highly believable scenario.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman's second DVD is both a visual and sound treat. Well stagged at Slane Castle, Ireland, which made a great backdrop for this multi-talented group of performers. <br /> <br />Each member of the group is a successful performer in their own right. The blending of their voices is outstanding.  A great chorus and musicians, makes this a DVD you will watch over and over, or even just listen to while working
B000001DU5|5.0|The sound is really original and highly creative. I like the song \\"Change.\\" I like the melody a lot. \\"Women in Chains\\" is another song with a beautiful sound. \\"Pale Shelter\\" is also another good song on this cd. It brings back the early to mid 80s where life was much simplier for a lot of people.  <br /> <br />The music is distinct, they don't sound like any other band.
0974869449|5.0|I've purchased a number of Japanese flash cards, including the Heisig and Tuttle kanji flash cards, and these are by far and away the best. Other reviewers have mentioned the good points of these cards, but they bear repeating.<br /><br />1.  The cards are printed on sturdy stock with a slick coating, making them a pleasure to use and easy to clean if you happen to be snacking. They also have rounded corners, making them a bit safer to handle.<br /><br />2.  In addition to the excellent physical design, the design on the cards themselves is very well done. On one side is the kanji, some sample phrases using the kanji, some similar kanji, and an illustration of the stroke order. On the reverse is the kana version of each kanji phrase, with an English translation, plus the on and kun readings of each kanji, and often an illustration showing what the components of the kanji are (for exmaple, woman + child, without using kanji).<br /><br />3.  The size of the type of the cards is good even for my eyes; I was having trouble reading the kanji in my textbook.<br /><br />I use the kanji side to drill my recognition of the kanji I am studying, and I use the opposite side to drill my memory of how to draw each.

1582701709|1.0|I couldn't believe I spent money on this crap.  The Secret is a book designed to lull you into a false sense of security.  Rhonda would have us believe we live in a kinder-gentler universe.  How about asking that, if you could, to the murder victims of last year if they agree with that.  I'm not even sure if the famous people she mentions in the book actually agreed with that assessment either.  Namely, Einstein.  Or else why would he have fled Nazi Germany?  I wish it were as easy as she makes it seem, that all you have to do is wish upon a star.  That the Universe will reward you with whatever you wish for, as long as you believe.  Great con job!  I'm all for philosophy that sees the world at it's ugliest, and then goes from there.  Like Schopenhauer, or Nietzche.  If someone wishes to hide their head in the sand, this is definitely their book.
1932100660|5.0|I've got to admit I was pretty skeptical at first (having seen a lot of garbage in the guise of nutrition and diet books) but after reading it I've come to the conclusion that this ought to be the fundamental textbook for a PhD-level nutrition science class.  (And I've also come to the conclusion that I may need to re-think a few things.  I hate it when that happens...) <br /> <br />I've been seriously perusing it for the past couple of weeks, and I'm surprised at how thorough the research is, and how intelligently he explains the data and conclusions.  About 90% of what he says agrees with my understanding and/or experience regarding these subjects over the past several years.  And for the 10% difference... I'm actually willing to concede that he may be right and I may be wrong on some of these. <br /> <br />This book is a very good, objective, scientific resource.  Finally, someone with unimpeachable credentials & the research to back it up explains the scientific reasons why (for example): <br /> <br />Type-2 diabetes is almost entirely self-induced... <br />Atkins is not only full of BS but dangerous and doomed to failure in the long run... <br />Diet has everything to do with the epidemic of heart disease in this country... <br />Diet also has a lot to do with the most prevalent types of Western cancer (colo-rectal, breast, prostate)... <br />Absolute avoidance of the sun may be as bad as too much sun... <br />Genetics has very little to play in many of these diseases - it's about 90/10 environmental factors... <br /> <br />And it's not just a bunch of well-intentioned theory.  He provides tons of footnotes and backs it all up with huge, multi-year, peer-reviewed studies.  Pretty unassailable. <br /> <br />(And I was stunned to find out that Doctors only get 20 HOURS of nutrition in med school...?  No wonder most of them don't know squat about the subject.  Same for exercise science.  So here you have the two absolute cornerstone subjects which are far and awaythe most important topics relating to your health, and they don't study them...???) <br /> <br />There were a couple of areas where I'd like to see some more info... <br /> <br />The main one is that I'd like to see more experimental differentiation between lean animal protein vs animal fat.  It's pretty obvious to anyone who's paying attention that animal fats (specifically non-Omega 3 animal fats) and most saturated fats in general (and all trans-fats) are the kiss of death (preceded by a crappy life in most cases) but the studies showing animal protein intake vs cancer & heart disease rates around the world are likely not showing the whole story.  He concedes that they usually run hand-in-hand (populations that eat a lot of animal based protein invariably eat a lot of animal fat) but I'd like to see the effects of a very low fat (and almost NO animal fat) whole-foods based diet, but in which some of the protein comes from lean animal sources.  (My interest in this is for selfish reasons, as this pretty much describes my diet, but a lot of other fitness-minded folks follow a similar program, and there's no sense throwing out the chicken with the chicken nuggets...) <br /> <br />The other area that needs more emphasis is on the importance of aerobic activity (and strength training) to go along with proper nutrition, as the two are really inseparable.  (At its most basic, calories in minus calories out equals weight gain or loss, plus there are a ton of other measurable medical benefits of exercise.)  I realize it's primarily a nutrition book and not an exercise book, but the fact that many (most?) people in developing countries are much more physically active than the average American obviously has a serious effect on their vastly lower rate of certain diseases (heart disease being foremost).  And Campbell does make this clear in one or two places, but it would be really instructive to see the results of studies where all participants had identical diets but the aerobic activity was varied.  (These studies exist - we've all seen them - but it would help paint the whole picture to include them in this book.)  Campbell obviously values the medical effects of cardio work - he's 70 and still runs 6 miles a day, and seems to give at least partial credit for his continuing mental agility to the benefits of aerobic exercise.  But the overall impression the reader may get is that health/wellness/fitness is perhaps 80/20 diet vs. exercise, when in reality it's probably at least 50/50. <br /> <br />But these are minor quibbles in light of the huge amount of scientific clarity this book provides on the overriding impact of diet on almost every aspect of our well-being.  And his expose of the whole government/industry/science/academia debacle (based on a lifetime on the inside of all this) is better than anything I've ever seen on the subject.  I hate to use this much hyperbole in one review, but this is probably the most important book I've read in the past 10 years.  Two thumbs way up.
B000NA28HU|3.0|I was very discouraged reading the reviews of this movie, but I went out and bought it anyway - I have the book and love it, I wanted to own the movie for my collection as well. I was skeptical about the casting, but after watching the movie I think the actors did well in their parts. My biggest issue was the length of the movie - 103 minutes? Not nearly enough time! They could've made it a 2 hour and 20 minute movie (like LoTR or some of the HP movies) and had nearly 40 more minutes to flesh out the characters and story. The movie was good, but too short - I think people will agree with that whether they've read the book or not. The computer animated Saphira was gorgeous, though.
B00005NDXY|5.0|I am partial because I am a big, big Nazareth fan.  Dan McAfferty, Pete Agnew and the rest have rocked and rocked since the seventies and they keep on rocking.  I know, I saw them when they toured with the \\"No Mean City\\" album and then in 2002.  Now to get to the review.  \\"Hair...\\" put Nazareth over the top.  None of their albums did as well as this one.  Love Hurts is the song that started the selling of the album, but the title cut \\"Hair...\\" became an anthem.  There is not one bad song on this CD.  All of them are fast rocking except for \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\", which is a ballad that knocks your socks off.  If you have never bought a Nazareth CD, this one is a great starting point (If you really are a hard rocker).  Some other songs to look for when buying Naz's CDs are Razamanaz, Broken Down Angel, Bad Bad Boy, Star, Whats In It For Me, Just To Get Into It, This Flight Tonight,Go Down Fighting, Expect No Mercy, Gone Dead Train, Place in Your Heart, Holiday, Heart's Grown Cold, Carry Out Feelings, Mountain Dew,Love Leads To Madness, Shanghai'd In Shanghai, etc.  I can keep on going.  I love Naz!!!!  I put them up there with Led Zep, Aerosmith, AC/DC, etc.  They never got the recognition that they deserved.  Dan, Pete, Lee, Jimmy, keep on rockin.  We miss you Darrell Sweet.  God Bless Your Rock and Roll Soul!  For you younger rockers, look up Manny Charlton! He was the fourth founding member of Naz (Dan, Pete Manny and Darrell).  Nazarerth rose from the ashes of the Shadettes in February 1970 in Dunfermline, Scotland and 37 years later Rock History is still being made!  Buy this album and many more Naz CDs
B000002UB6|5.0|No  group  should  have  as  much  talent  as  the  Beatles  had.  It  was  nearly  impossible  for  them  to  screw  up  any  project  they  had  their  heart  in.  They  came  as  close  as  they  could  to  messing  up  this  one,  but  they  didn't  succeed.  Phil  Spector's  sweetened  versions  of  \\"Let  It  Be\\"  and  \\"The  Long  And  Winding  Road\\"  earned  Paul  McCartney's  ire  (John  Lennon  was  the  one  who  had  the  idea  to  bring  Spector  in),  but  the  fact  is,  this  is  a  classic  just  like  the  Beatles'  other  great  work.

One  song  alone--Paul's  \\"Oh,  Darling\\"--was  imitated  again  and  again  throughout  the  decade.  George  Harrison  was  finally  recognized  on  his  own  for  the  gorgeous  \\"Something\\"  and  \\"Here  Comes  The  Sun\\",  possibly  the  two  finest  things  he  ever  did.  John  Lennon  was  just  John  Lennon:  he  pokes  fun  at  himself  and  Yoko  Ono  on  \\"Come  Together\\"  and  later  does  some  of  his  patented  nonsense  (similar  to  \\"Revolution  9\\" on  The  White  Album\\") with  \\"I  Want  You  (She's  So  Heavy)\\".  Later  John  claimed  this  was  the  first  heavy  metal  track.  Who's  to  say  he's  wrong?

This  genre-spanning  work  didn't  quite  come  off  the  way  Paul  wanted  it  to  (John's  and  George's  contributions  don't  mesh  with  his  very  well),  but  all  you  need  to  know  is  that  throughout  the  world,  rock  groups  had  to go  back  to  the  drawing  board  after  this  one.

B000NA28IE|1.0|This movie was horrible. If anybody bought this movie, shame on you. You've wasted like $10-20 on a crap movie that has nothing to do with the book. I agree w/ the past writer.

He threw it away and used SparkNotes or something. Horrible movie. It sucked.
B000002UAX|5.0|Only  the  Beatles  would  dare  to  do  an  album  like  this.  Even  they  did  it  despite  the  protests  of  their  producer,  George  Martin,  who  believed  a  single  record  with  the  best  of  these  songs  would  be  sufficient.  The  way  each  track  flows  into  the  next  changed  music  as  much  as  anything  the  Beatles  did,  and  the  humor  on  \\"Happiness  Is  A  Warm  Gun\\"  and  \\"Rocky  Racoon\\"  is  priceless.  Other  tracks  of  note  include  Eric  Clapton's  guest  appearance  on  his  pal  George's \\"While  My  Guitar  Gently  Weeps\\",  Paul's  1930s-style  \\"Honey  Pie\\"  and  Ringo's  beautiful  (though  intended  as  satiric) concluding  number,  \\"Good Night\\".
B000002L5P|5.0|A debut album like the one by The Smiths makes one wonder: what was life like before it was released? To whom could disaffected teens and twenty-somethings turn before Morrissey made things clear for all who heard him? Interestingly, my life was more or less Smiths-less until I was in my late-20s. My only exposure to them before that came from a high school friend who did everything in his power to get me to like the band. Alas, I was hopelessly devoted to classic and progressive rock at the time, and wasn't about to admit that contemporary popular music that didn't have it's origins in the 1970s could be worthwhile or (heaven forbid) better. Thankfully, I became a convert in time for Morrissey's solo comeback, and I feel that I have more than made up for lost time.<br /><br />The Smiths were never known for rocking hard, but they were always able to put their own twist on basic rock 'n roll. Throughout their career, this would often take the form of rockabilly. On their debut, it is demonstrated by the spot-on single \\"Hand In Glove,\\" which marries old-fashioned harmonica with Johnny Marr's R.E.M.-like, trance-inducing arpeggios. Morrissey also presents himself right off the bat as someone who wouldn't pull any punches in terms of subject matter. In this song, he sings of homosexual love as something as sincere and deep or as delicate and fleeting as any other form of love. The band rocks the hardest on \\"Miserable Lie,\\" which drummer Mike Joyce speeds along in an agile fashion. Morrissey starts to sound like a rooster at the end, but he regains his composure nicely for \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves.\\"<br /><br />The latter two tracks began the Morrissey tradition of revealing the disposition of the singer and the song in the title itself. Obviously most of these were not ready-made for widespread appeal. However, Morrissey and Marr knew just as well how to craft a single with hit potential, as indicated not only by \\"Hand In Glove,\\" but also \\"This Charming Man\\" - which is propelled by excellent groovy bass work by Andy Rourke and trademark jangle by Marr - and \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\". Perhaps the best way to illustrate the difference between the singles and the rest of the album's songs is to consider the contrast between the first song listeners heard on the radio (\\"Hand In Glove\\") and the first one they heard on record, \\"Reel Around the Fountain.\\" The latter trades all of the radio-ready punch for a more intimate feel.  That difference between their singles and non-singles noted, \\"Still Ill\\" -also featuring a harmonica - may have proved to be hit-worthy in its own right.<br /><br />As great as The Smiths' best albums are, they each have one dud on them. On The Queen is Dead, it is \\"Never Had No One Ever\\", and on Strangeways, Here We Come it is \\"Death of a Disco Dancer.\\" On the debut album, it is \\"I Don't Owe You Anything,\\" which is borderline musak. But like the songs on the other records, it is not enough to make it a lesser album, but simply to slow its momentum a bit. \\"Suffer Little Children\\" doesn't pick up the pace or lift one's spirits, but it closes the album by affecting the listener in the way that a Smiths song is meant to.<br /><br />The Smiths' 1984 debut was one of the best and most important debuts of the 1980s, and in the history of indie/alternative rock.

It was also the start of a career that, in terms of the ratio of length and quality, can only be compared to The Beatles.

B00005JLZN|3.0|I don't know quite how to put it.  The Life of David Gale is certainly a message film sprinkled with suspense, but the ending left me bewildered. Why did the murder suspect mail Bitsey a second tape that showed David Gale involved with the suicide? Other questions I raise are: What motive did Berlin have for charging Gale with rape? Why did Gale's wife and son flee to Italy or was it Spain? Is Gale's situation so hopeless that he decides to die for the cause? Gale and the murder suspect didn't seem to have a strong bond of friendship, yet what would compel the murder suspect to travel to Europe with a suitcase of money and make sure that Gale's wife receives it?  Does anyone have any answers? The film is complex with its layers of left wing politics, morality plays, and Hitchcockian twists, but still comes up short.  A classic film that contrasts innocence with guilt without the death penalty issue is The Wrong Man starring Henry Fonda.
1582701709|5.0|So far this is a great book. Very informative and inspirational. I think it just reinforces what we already know, but we are not quite sure about how to put this into practice. This book tells you how to put it into practice. I have not had a chance to finish it yet, but so far it is great.
B00006EXCC|4.0|This is the British version of the Rolling Stone's Aftermath album, which doesn't include \\"Paint It Black,\\" thank goodness. Aren't we all just a little tired of that song. Anyway, most Stones fans already have it on a greatest hits album, or in my case the Singles collection. On this British version \\"Paint It Black\\"  is replaced by \\"Mothers Little Helper.\\" What a gem! Other great tracks not on the American album were \\"Out Of Time,\\" \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" & \\"What To Do.\\" Also, the classic \\"Under My Thumb\\" is here. The sound quality is much better than the 80's disc with better stereo separation as well. This was the first time the band went into the recording studio with a real album in mind, instead of a bunch of singles and cover songs. There is one big 11 minute filler on this album and even if you skip it, you're still left with a solid 42 minute album. Essential Rolling Stones!<br /><br />4 1/2 stars.
B000MM0L2S|4.0|The tremendous range and diversity of Ennio Morricone's prodigious talent is on display in this tribute album by a surprising mix of artists performing their own renditions of the Maestro's work. Andrea Bocelli, Bruce Springsteen, Metallica, Herbie Hancock, Quincey Jones and Yo Yo-Ma are among the performers, and the performances range from good to great (though a couple of them weigh in as simply odd). Celine Dion's vocalization of the haunting theme from \\"Once upon a Time in America\\" opens the album, and is better to listen to than it was to watch on the Academy Awards. The music is continuous, with transitions crafted by Morricone himself, who also contributes a couple of the performances. I have only one complaint: the album label and liner notes do not identify the film from which each piece comes. As an intermediate-level Morricone Geek, I can identify most of them--but there are two or three I'd like to know more about.
0312323867|5.0|I can't decide if I liked Something Borrowed or Something Blue better!  I loved this book.  It was so cute and I love Darcy's personality.  It was so funny to read the book from her point of view.  I thought the ending was cute.  I loved it from start to finish.
B000J103PC|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in some time.  It had a little bit of everything and I especially like the role Meryl Streep had she was phenomenal and very believable.  I would highly recommend this movie I enjoyed it so much.

0553804367|5.0|Amazingly Hawking and Mlodinaw discuss the concepts of energy, time, relativity, space, time travel, black holes, quantum gravity, wormholes and string theory using almost no equations, excepting Einstein's famous E=mc2.  They use common sense and mundane examples to explain some of the most complex ideas ever pondered by humankind.  Mlodinaw's famous humor rears its head at appropriate times, while the writing style is straightforward and easily comprehended.  However, there are several sentences for which one has to go back and reread and think about before proceeding.  But overall it's a fun book and leaves the layman with a rudimentary understanding of a very complex subject.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|It is one of the best DVD collection we have, My wife who is deployed to Iraq jsut can't get enough of it, she will watch and rewatch a epsoide a day
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I loved this movie! It combined my two favorite things.. England and Romance! I loved the storyline, or rather, the two storylines.  I know that Jude Law was suppossed to be the hunky sex symbol in the movie... but I fell for Jack Black in this movie. He is just so darn cute in this movie. Its a nice change of pace for him.  If you love romantic comedies, don't miss this one!
B00005JNS0|4.0|When I first bought this movie, I thought that it would be OK to watch because of the animation. Even though I'm not a real race car fan, I found myself surprisingly involved and enjoying this movie! It's great! Highly recommended. Kids and adults alike can both enjoy.

B000GFLEJA|5.0|We all know about fear and loathing's story line (which is superb and incredibly funny), however my review is of the quality of the content (compared to the standard DVD which I also own). <br /> <br />Nothing is simple in the world of technology - and simply buying an HD-DVD does not mean that the sound & picture is going to be the best money can buy, I purchased full metal jacket on HD-DVD and was dissapointed by the quality of it.  Fear & Loathign is quite the opposite.... <br /> <br />I was blown away by the picture and sound quality - compared to other HD-DVD's I own this one is by far the best, the picture is so clear you can see the pores on johhny depps face. <br /> <br />I would seriously reccomend this product over the standard DVD.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Interesting retelling of an old story, but not in the race with the 1990s Iron Man cartoons in Marvel Action Hour. <br />LET'S SEE THEM, PLEASE MARVEL. <br />In the style of Ultimate Avengers, the producers take extensive license with their own characters, and rewrite comic book history on the animated screen. This was not their best work, but still very entertaining to watch, <br />Peter
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has the best voice I have ever heard in my life!!I listen to all his songs nonstop,but this album is his best one.It far outshines his debut album and I think it's even better than Awake.The English songs are comparable,but the foriegn songs are much better in Closer.I love it so much,I'm gonna go through each song.    Oceano-I love that this is the first song on the CD.It starts with a trickling piano and a quiet Josh and gradually gets louder and more filled with energy.It's perfect to wake up to in the morning.The chorus is amazing.And the words in Italian are beautiful-about the one he loves leaving him shipwrecked.    My Confession-This sounds rather Spanish with the guitar and the tolling bell.Very gripping and expertly written.It's basically him telling his love how wrong he's been about her and how much he really loves her.    Mi Mancherai-This is the most beautiful song I've ever heard.Joshua Bell on the violin is just magical.Paired with the voice of Groban,they're unstopable.Simply gorgeous.    Si Volvieras A Mi-This is my favorite foriegn language song of all time.And I've heard a lot of them.It's the only one in Spanish.The lyrics are breathtakingly heartrending.The music is so singable that I memorized the entire song-in Spanish.The climax is outstanding as they are in all his songs.    When You Say You Love Me-Such a sweet song.Josh gives such effort and talent into this with the many soaring parts that leaves you stricken with amazement.    Per Te-I'm not very taken with this one.There is no really outstanding part to it and the music itself isn't gripping and moving like the rest are.    All'Improvviso Amore-This is a fun song,with a rather bright chorus that probably wasn't what they were going for,judging by the lyrics.Not his greatest,but I still love it.    Broken Vow-Oh this is the sadest breakup song ever.With the piano accompaniment and the tragic message...It's just rips your heart out.    Caruso-This seems more like an Andrea Bocelli song than one for Josh.The words run through like a flood and the music is-again-heartbreaking.    Remember When It Rained-O my gosh,this is THE greatest Groban song ever.Even better than You Raise Me Up-if it's possible.The words(co-written by Josh) are beautiful and compelling.You can feel the emotion in the every word and the climax is the best part any of his songs.Stunning!    Hymne a l'Amore-this song is in French.It's very pretty,but it doesn't seem to work with Josh.It's lacking someting...    You Raise Me Up-Josh's most popular song-and with good reason.He uses a gospel choir which adds so much energy and emotion to the already stellar performance.Josh hits a high B flat which isn't as good as some,but it sounds better than most.A real hit!    Never Let Go-Josh gets kind of off the trail with this one;experimenting,I guess.It took me a while to get used to,but when I did,I loved it.    There also are two bonus tracks;    Mi Morena-It's in English,by the way.This talks about his love and infatuation for this girl.Rather sensual.Not really.Just some lyrics.Very artistic,though.    She's Out Of My Life-Actually,this is probably sader than Broken Vow.Beautiful piano again and heartrending to the fullest.      So this is definately the greatest of his albums.Beautiful foriegn songs,heart rending break up songs,amazing climaxes,and a voice from heaven.I you want some of Josh,this is the best one to get,but you really should get Awake too.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|If you want to see something different, THIS IS YOUR MOVIE! <br />It pulls you into the story with the very compelling acting from all the actors.  Profound and thought-provoking!
B00007LTIL|5.0|this is the grateful dead's masterpiece. can't be touched. robert hunter's finest batch of lyrics; songs populated by outsiders and misfits doing their thing. divine melodies and harmonies, loads of toe-tapping feel good music. a couple of breathlessly beautiful slow numbers to boot. \\"truckin'\\" is as catchy a number as you'll find anywhere, with its propulsive bass rhythms carrying along robert hunter's great lyrics about a drug bust. the song also sports stinging electric guitar licks by garcia, and a chorus that enters your head and stays there long passed what a reasonable leaving time should be. this is great american music. a masterpiece. a classic. not to be missed.
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson's spot-on script comes to life with Ang Lee's excellent direction.  You'll find no anachronistic \\"babes\\" in this version.  The filmakers are satisfied with the characters as Austen created them.  Romantic, funny, and heartbreaking, Austen's \\"marriage plot\\" delivers realistic heroines and heroes, and one villain who breaks your heart.  Must-see.
0374105235|5.0|It truly is amazing that Ishmael Beah has triumphed through a life of hardship.  In \\"A Long Way Gone\\" Beah does an excellent job telling his life story, which is extremely fascinating and disturbing.  To say Beah has an eventful and trying life is an understatement....to see that he's come out of this a well-adjusted, intelligent young man is remarkable.
B000M341QO|5.0|The actors are great; the plot suspenseful; and, the ending is good too.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I am an avid Will and Grace fan and when I saw the series finale on DVD I bought it. <br />I was not 100% in love with the finale - i felt it was extremely rushed into one hour.  <br />I think the best part though is how the series was tied back to the beginning (with them sitting on the same chairs talking on the phone to eachother ~ to the bar scene where they do shots).  <br />The saddest part (saddest in a good way) was the duet of Megan Mullally (Karen) and Sean Hayes (Jack). That song just puts the series finale into perspective. <br />This DVD is wonderful though I have a feeling the series finale will be included in the final season when that is released on DVD - so this disk might not be a neccessity because it will be included then; however, for those avid fans who enjoy watching W&G daily - its worth the money. <br />W&G The series will always get 5 stars from me.
0694013889|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars except for the page that gives a part by part look at a girl's body, and has her bent over so you can see where the poo-poo comes out.  Strange!!!  I mean, it's illustrated and not a photo or anything like that, and it makes sense why it's there, but it still caught us off guard.  It made Daddy very uncomfortable when he was reading it to our daughter.
0974153001|5.0|This is my favorite book for sculpting! Great demonstrations for sculpting the hands, feet, legs, torso, face. It even shows you how to make the clothes and the hair.

0739321005|4.0|After hearing countless political speeches over the years, I wasn't expecting to be impressed or amazed by any speakers at the Democratic Convention of 2004, especially after John Kerry won the Democratic ticket.  Then Obama walked on stage.  I had no idea who he was so I settled into my chair preparing for another long-winded speech.  By the time he left the stage 15 minutes later, I had been moved to tears.  Obama is undoubtedly the most electrifying speaker in politics today. All a reasonable person needs is a few minutes with this man and he has your vote.  He has a real shot at being elected president or vice president in 2008.  So if you are going to vote for him or not, it would be a good idea to hear about his unique journey through life.   <br /> <br />He's a great storyteller, using different voices and accents when telling about conversations he had.  Listening to this book on CD was a great experience.  It is not as important as his \\"Audacity of Hope\\", which tells about is brief time in the US Senate and gives his views on most issues, but \\"Dreams of My Father\\" is essential if you want to know how Barack Obama came to be what he is today.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I first heard Tool when seeing them live at Lollapalooza back in 93 (Undertow days). I quickly picked up Opiate and Undertow. Then, the amazing AEnima came and what can I say, just WOW! Lateralus was good as well but not quite as powerful.<br /><br />10,000 Days feels like 2 different albums. You have Tool's heavier songs, which I'm totally into and then the mellow, moodier songs, which I'm not really partial to. Don't get me wrong, I do keep an open mind. I have tried more than a few times to get into the slower songs but they just make me want to skip over them so I can get to the more rocking tunes, which I now do. They did this on Lateralus as well but I didn't mind so much because they were much shorter and they felt more transitional, like outros and intros. On this one, however, they just keep going on. \\"Wings of Marie Parts 1&2\\" combined is almost 20 minutes long. That's a big chunk of the album to disconnect from the listener after the excitment of \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\". I do like it when a band does something different and \\"out there\\" but only if they make it interesting. On these songe, there was no change and there was nothing really going on vocally or instrumentally to keep any kind of dynamic range.<br /><br />The positives are, the heavier songs are really good. Some of the better songs that they've recorded in their career. If the album was full of songs like that, it would've been a 5 star review.<br /><br />If you're one of those people that enjoys the heavier and mellower side of Tool, then you've got the perfect album for you. Kudos! I however am into  Tool because of their complex rhythms, piercing vocals and intricate guitar work. I think most Tool fans prefer the heavier stuff also but I could be wrong.
B000M341QE|5.0|Excellent movie!  There are so many twists and turns, this movie will keep you in your seat, even viewing it at home.  The ending was awesome--you never see it coming.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone is, so far, the best and most accurate depiction of the Tombstone and later life of Wyatt Earp and the life and times of the era.  There are a few inaccuracies in the plot, but not enough to keep a viewer from getting the whole picture. The cast was well chosen, to fit each role like a glove. <br />Since both movies, WYATT EARP with Kevin Cosner and TOMBSTONE, came out the same year, Tombstone has the slight edge over it's competitor. Both movies, though, displayed particular situations that are historic, that the other did not. <br />Over all.... 5 stars. I watch it over and over again.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Yet another excellent movie!!  This movie is unusual because not only does the action take place overseas, there is a sub-plot that starts in the US and ends in Mexico. Really gritty, lots of action.

B000H7JD4K|4.0|I'm a huge maiden fan, always have been always will. And im plased to announce that yet again they have a great album release. I'm not going to say its their best album, my favorites are 7th son and number, nor am i going to say its the best of new era maiden (6 member maiden) i think brave new world is the best of their new stuff, but its definately a great experience none the less. the only complaint i really have is that all the songs are epics now. this trend started pretty much with DOD. The shortest song on the album is like 5 minutes long and the rest are 6-9 minutes long. now dont get me wrong it is 6-9 minutes of greatness, but i also feel that the album is just not as easy to go through as a whole like some of the older ones. like number of the beast had all songs ranging from 3 1/2 minutes to 5 minutes and then finished strongly with an awesome epic (the epics of all epics) HBTN. this one is epic after epic. not that big a deal, it still is greatness, but I do miss the thunderous and quick paced songs like the trooper or the wicker man. my favorite song btw is the greater good of god.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I bought this for my wife and she likes it OK. To me all 3 CDs sound like one song, except \\"Don't know why\\" from her first album \\"Come Away With me\\", which is the wonderful timeless classic that made her famous. If this is your first Norah purchase, buy \\"Come Away With Me\\" instead, which is my wife's favorite CD of all times.
B000NA28HU|3.0|I will start by saying I have NOT read this book but I may go back and read it now to see what was missing.<br /><br />The movie was not bad, but it was WAY too short.  You could tell there was so much storyline missing from the story.  You hardly got a chance to know any of the characters before something monumentous happened.  Eragon has a baby dragon.  Eragon hears a guy talking about dragon riders.  Eragon decides the dragon needs to fly and when it does it suddenly morphs into a full-sized dragon who can mind speak.  Eragon goes on a journey with the guy who was talking about dragon riders.  Big chase, confrontation, big chase again, big battle, the end.  Whatever happened to character developement.  Did the secondary characters really mean that little to the whole of the story?  An hour and a half is not nearly long enough for this movie and must have been a great insult to the book.  So much more should have been done.  I enjoyed the film, but was left wanting.

9562913686|5.0|There are two books I read years ago that transformed my life for the better. One was Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization and the second was Joseph Murphy's The Power of Your Subconscious Mind. My best friend had recommended both books to me during a difficult period, when I was recuperating from surgery. To this day, I practice the teachings in both books, and the affirmations that I've composed for myself, based on my needs and goals, have never failed to lift my spirits, or put me in a better frame of mind, as well as lighten my physical & emotional load. I truly subscribe to the belief that as you think, so you are...and Murphy's teachings have helped me to channel my negative, defeatist, pessimistic thoughts into positive and empowering thoughts & actions. To fully reap the benefits of this book, one does need to have an open mind. I hope many more people benefit from this book as I have.
1594200696|5.0|My new \\"The Elements of Style\\" by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White, illustrated by Maira Kalman, lies before me now, beside the 1959 edition that I have had since August of that year.<br /><br />Since I hadn't reread the old one in who knows how many years, what induced me to buy a new one? I have always retained affection for Strunk's \\"little book.\\"<br /><br />Recently I read a review of the new \\"The Elements of Style Illustrated,\\" and saw a few of the paintings by Maira Kalman. And I heard of the song cycle, based on the book, composed by young Nico Muhly in collaboration with Ms. Kalman and premiered in the Rose Main Reading Room of the New York Public Library.<br /><br />The illustrated book sounded like fun, so I ordered it, which prompted me to read Strunk's words again with new appreciation.<br /><br />The overall design of the new book is appealing -- bright red covers, a somewhat larger format (about an inch wider, a half-inch taller, and 156 pages as opposed to 71), the cleaner look of the pages (with more white space and semi-glossy). Both books are hardbacks; I think I would not like the feel of the new one as a paperback.<br /><br />Most striking on the mostly bare, red front cover, is a huge white colon punctuation mark, centered below \\"THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE.\\" The printing is white (no connection to E. B. White, I'm sure). The word \\"illustrated\\" in small gold italic is printed near the lower right. The red back cover is completely bare except for a matching, centered white semicolon.<br /><br />The cover designer, presumably Ms. Kalman or someone she worked closely with, no doubt intended that we follow these magnified punctuation marks: The colon by reading and viewing the book. The semicolon by proceeding to our own independent work.<br /><br />Ms. Kalman's paintings are colorful, mostly full page, some double page, and attractively quirky. Her subject's eyes are intelligent and draw you in. The first double page appears to be of E. B. White, comfortably seated with a book, in a roomful of books -- piled on the tables, stacked on the floor, shelved in bookcases; on another chair, I think I see his dachshund Minnie who won't relinquish her place to more books. At the end of  \\"Elements\\" are Ms. Kalman's paintings of Strunk, White again, and of herself.<br /><br />Those of you who were introduced to Strunk years ago, in a Diction and Usage class somewhere (say, Ann Arbor), don't need anyone else to tell you of his value and influence.  You who have yet to read him, should have confidence in the millions who already have, knowing that his brief remarks about writing will prove clarifying, incisive, and encouraging. Enjoy Maira Kalman's gallery. The book is a thing of intellectual and visual beauty.-- piled on the tables, stacked on the floor, shelved in bookcases; on another chair, I think I see his dachshund Minnie who won't relinquish her place to more books.

B000NIVJEU|5.0|In these days of political driven movies, it is nice to see a movie done with such quality of this movie and made you cheer for good things at the end. <br /> <br />I especially love the scenary of this movie and sound was excelient. It was very beutifully done. A lot of people complain about Fox movies for price and such - but then again you can get on Amazon prime and it well worth it. <br /> <br />This is definely enjoyable addition to my collection.
0790729350|5.0|Although I would have been 3 years old! And the fact that I was living in Japan wouldn't have helped. lol!<br />But this DVD catches that moment in US pop culture so well. The music, the people, the language they use. The corny questions of reporters, the skinny-dipping!<br />I've been wanting to see this DVD, for the music if not for a history lesson! It was worth it.<br />It was a real trip. The split screen editing is cool (and you get to see more). But just the fact that this event was recorded is great for us who couldnt be there.<br />Admittedly the film quality isnt the best, but it adds to that 1969 feel, but I was impressed that the sound was 5.1.<br />Great fun and good way to relive history.

0618680004|3.0|I had high expectations for this book. I had hoped that this book would provide me the rational arguments for the non-existence of God. Unfortunately, I didn't find any of these arguments in the book. The author was pretty good in summarizing the different views for and against the existence of God. So I can't complain about the contents of the book, however I didn't find the ground-breaking ideas that would convince me that God is a delusion. The author definitely provides an alternative window from which one can conclude that there's no God but I don't think he's even close in proving his claim.  <br /> <br />So, if you're new to issues around religion and want to know about different views around the existence of God, this book is for you. If you're looking for a sound argument for non-existence of God, this book will keep you reading but you'll be disappointed at the end.

0061122416|2.0|I bought this book after reading all the great reviews about it and I'm pretty disappointed. The book has a good message but that's all it has really. The story is very simplistic and predictable, characters were under described, the message was repeated several times in the same kind of way. The language was very simple, I felt like I was reading a kid's book. This is a good book for a young reader but I don't think serious readers will find it stimulating.
0743556003|5.0|The 5 stars are for Winningham's masterful characterization on the audio version of this book.  Using a multitude of accents, pacings, and other techniques, she makes a quiet, slow King story come utterly alive.  Even better, she turns each of the different characters into distinct individuals. <br /> <br />If I had picked up this book to read, I might very well have abandoned it after the first 100 pages (like another reviewer stated).  The story is slow to develop.  But Winningham's insight into Lisey is perfect; she hooks your attention and never lets go.  The strange idioms King uses (such as \\"blood bool\\") sound perfectly natural in Winningham's voice.   <br /> <br />I have rarely had such enjoyment in the car as I have in the last dozen or so days listening to this book.  I feel as if King has delved into my own marriage and pulled out all the \\"bad gunky\\" and put it on display.
B000FGGE68|2.0|This is the most dumbest story I've ever seen.  It does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it.
1878424505|5.0|Im now reading this for a THIRD time.  What started out as a book report for a college class, is turning into a fascination!  It truly has opened a part of my mind that would have been closed forever. <br /> <br />MUST READ!!!  Easy reading, no $1000 words and I felt the authors' knowledge and caring while I was reading. <br />
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This latest CD from Ms. McKennitt can only be described as hauntingly beautiful.  Definitely a must have for any collection.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I ordered the dvd and within the week it was already in my mail box, it was fine and we watch it all the time A+!
B000LC55F2|5.0|I really like the movie. People are conplaining that it went from a period piece to sci-fi. Be a little more open minded folks its a movie not a textbook. I watched the movie pretty closely so I feel confident that I can clear some stuff up for those people who have questions. <br /> <br />Borden didnt tie the knot to purposely kill Angiers wife they had both agreed the other knot would be stronger and she says she can slip out of it in the beginning of the movie (she couldnt and drowned)  <br /> <br />When Angier asked Borden which knot he tied and he says he doesnt know, he really doesnt cause his brother was the one that did it.  <br /> <br />Cutter knew all the time that Borden was a twin he just never told Angier. <br /> <br />When Angier test the machine for the first time he has a gun with him in case something went wrong (like if he is disfigured or something) he says he didnt want to live that way.  When his clone appears he shots it because he is surprised. <br /> <br />Angier did set Borden up to take the fall for his death he says so in his dairy when Borden is reading it in jail.  He knew that Borden would want to know what was going on under the stage. He set up 100 shows cause he knew that eventually Borden would come. <br /> <br />In one scene Borden is telling his twin who is in disguise to leave Angier alone and not to go back there (the twin doesnt listen and goes anyway)  <br /> <br />In one scene we see Borden at dinner with Oliva (Johannsen) and he tells her \\"part of me loves you and part of me loves my wife\\".  His wife pretty much from the start knew something was not right cause she tells him when he says I love you somedays he means it and some days he doesnt. She is driven to drink by the hot and cold treatment she is getting from the brothers cause one of them doesnt love her then she kills herself. In one scene he is telling his twin she knows something isnt right talk to her and convince her I love her.  The twin in jail even apologizesfor what happened to Sarah and says he never meant to hurt her. <br /> <br />Angier is basically drowning himself every night in the water tanks and a clone like him in every way, shape and form is created. Then he does it again the next night. Since the original always stays in the machine (the top hat, the cat, Angier) the original Angier was dead and gone before the 100 shows even started.  He admits that he is scared to death everytime he gets into the machine. He choses to drown them because 1.this way he doesnt even have to deal with them when they are alive like the one he shot and 2.Cutter told him a story that a sailer once said that drowning was like going home. In the end he admits he lied, the sailor said drowning was agony. After every show the blind stage hands carries out a water tank with a dead Angier inside.  <br /> <br />Tesla didnt mean for the machine to clone he tells Angier when they discover that it does that he will need a few weeks to iron out the problem but he never gets the chance too because the men come and burn his place down. He sends the machine to Angier but tells him to destroy it. <br /> <br />The twin that hangs was the one that loved Oliva  <br /> <br />The old asian man who makes the fishbowl appear is only pretending to be crippled but he does it ALL THE TIME to hide his secret (he carries the bowl between his legs). The same way the twins have decided to live one life to keep up the trick. They were all not afraid to \\"get their hands dirty\\" as Borden says in the movie. <br /> <br />Cutter is visably upset when he finds out the truth that Angier is still alive and Borden was set up.  <br /> <br />For those who ask why Cutter didnt go to the police when he figured it out it was the 18th century who was going to believe him plus there was still a dead body that no amount of explaining would have made go away someone was gonna have to take the fall for it.
1582701709|1.0|There is no actual \\"secret\\" in \\"The Secret.\\" If you want a breakdown of what this book is: Think happy thoughts. There you go, I just saved you $15. There is nothing new to be found in this book, just a collection of thoughts and ideas from \\"important\\" people who have \\"evidence\\" that thinking happy thoughts can dramatically change things in your life. <br /> <br />There are claims that food doesn't actually make you gain weight, but the thought that food makes you gain weight makes you gain weight. Go ahead and get that triple-bypass - er, I mean, triple-decker bacon cheeseburger you've been craving. No problem as long as you believe it won't effect your weight (never mind your cholesterol). There is also a claim that if you truly believe you can see well, you will lose your dependence on glasses or contacts. Byrne herself claims that people only think they need reading glasses as they get older, because they're told that their eyes will get worse. That must be the explanation for why I got glasses when I was in fifth grade. <br /> <br />I also found it deeply offensive on page 61 when the reader is told to ignore overweight people, but instead turn our minds to ourselves in our perfect bodies. That's a great idea. Next, we should put all the people who don't fit in with our idea of \\"perfect\\" in concentration camps and create a whole nation of beautiful, skinny people - all exactly the same. Oh wait, I think the Nazis already tried that. <br /> <br />I have no problem with the basic idea of this book. I think it's great to have a positive, happy outlook on life. In fact, that's how I try to live my own life. But there is no reason to buy this book (no matter how great Oprah tells you it is) in order to live this way. Believing something is true doesn't make it true. You have to work at everything. You can't cure a deadly disease just by thinking you can (though it probably helps), you can't lose weight simply by imagining yourself in a \\"perfect\\" body, and you can'trestore your eyesight to 20/20 just by thinking you can see well. <br /> <br />I'm afraid that this book is going to create a group of people who sit around all day wishing and trying to believe that something is true. Go ahead and think happy thoughts, but don't believe for a second that it's going to solve world hunger, or cure AIDS and cancer, or stop global warming from happening. People will actually have to work to make those things happen.
B000NA28IE|5.0|This was a good movie, and I just don't understand the rest of the reviewers... I just hate to compare one movie with another with similar plot... This movie was unique in its own way... and  it is not better or worst than any other... it was good by itself, had action, great visual effects and could get better in the sequel... Like the Da Vinci Code, the book is long and complex, and can not be shown in detail in a movie... not even a 3 hour movie... give it a try... good for the family
B000ICM5VW|5.0|Great Movie.  The picture quality of this HD DVD is unbelievable.  I show scenes from it any time a friend comes over
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is beautiful in every sense of the word . After I watched it , I found myself wondering why Hollywood can't make more movies like this one . While all of the blockbuster films here are centered around killing , drugs , and sex without love , Amelie is an incredibally moving story about a young woman who truly desires to help people . It show us how a single act of kindness can change lives . Isn't that something we should all keep in mind ? Oh yeah ,... Audrey Tautou is the cutest star in cinema and you can't help adoring her .
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I  miss Piecer Brosnan in this movie. We need a James Bond with not just so handsome but charming in acting and moving like a prince of Cat. Some of you are traitor to Piecer Brosnan. When he was the best and hottest  , you said  he was the best Bond. Of course  some of you are ugly guys  that why you did not like Piecer Brosnan. However, i liked Casino Royale and delighted for giving  4 stars.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|This show has some great flawed characters that keep it real and drive the stories. The family aspect is the yeast that makes it rise. Joe's (Alison's husband) skepticism and simultaneous support of his wife keeps the show grounded and warm. There are a few intese scenes that are for the most part handled discretely. This is not a show I would alow any grade schooler to veiw. They do a great job of demonstrating undiluted evil and the will to fight that evil from her perspective as a mother, wife, and person with all the heartache and strength it brings.
0143038419|5.0|Amazon.com kept recommending this book for me everytime I visited their website...I figured I better read it. Having recently gone through my own nasty divorce and with my own love of international travel I guess I couldn't resist. Although I found the first section of the book a bit depressing because I felt I relived again my own divorce I also found I could not put the book down. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and felt I could relate to the author in so many ways. I even marked several sections I want to go back and reread. It not only helped me look at my situation and deal with issues I know I had left unresolved, it also left me realizing that life does go on and you can find happiness and love again. Thanks Elizabeth for your insight.
074356619X|3.0|The DVD is very inspiring and much more attention-grabbing than the book.  However, GETTING TO THE REVIEWER'S COMMENT REGERDING BYRNE'S STATEMENTS ABOUT VICTIM BLAMING:  This is a very tricky area, especially when you think about rape, murder, or even genocide.  What she may have meant is that in many cases, you cannot merely rely on the intentions of the victim as the catalyst for a crime... because the intentions of the perpetrator may be much much greater, stronger, thus forcing the act into existence. We cannot blame the victim for not having enough mental clarity and personal power to ward off every personal attack or stop the intentions of those who kill to further their cause (genocide) or even control the weather for that matter.  I think that this issue needs to be elaborated on... that what we intend comes true as long as what others intend are not in direct, immediate opposition, and stronger than our own intentions. In order to get around this, one may have to remove himself or herself from the situation or people who are causing this.  It's not like we are causing the bad situations to occur, but as long as we continue to live in an environment rich in negativity, all of our greatest positive intentions will struggle to become a reality.
1416914285|3.0|This book is good, but if you have read any of Cassandra Clare's Draco series you will be disappointed. She uses a TON of stuff from it over again; whole passages are exactly the same and one of the main characters, Jace, IS Draco Malfoy- back story and all. If you haven't read any of Clare's fanfiction, pick this book up. But if you have, pass this up.

B000MZHW4A|4.0|Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone.  Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.<br /><br />Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life.  However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade.  Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.<br /><br />The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins.  The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles.  But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film.  Recommended.  Grady Harp, March 07rady Harp, March 07
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|Great to have MOGAMBO on DVD. It looks good. Not your usual John Ford film from my view. Clark Gable is the man and really he seems to have more effect on the look of this film.  Good loves story flows tailored for Gable no doubt. Good one in all.
1582701709|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and the movie.  I think that attitude is everything.  When I read the negative reviews of this book I felt that those people are just stuck and determined to stay there. Especially the ones who say they already have a positive attitude. Excuse me? When we are clear about our intentions to seek the positive we will move in a positive direction.  I think this book and DVD offer great mechanisms for improving your life - if you really want to.  Nobody can do it for you.  I wouldn't want to spend much time with the naysayers - too depressing! Work is necessary yes- but would you rather work with a happy point of view or a miserable point of view? Truthfully I thought it was fluff the first time through too- until I thought about it. It is simply good advice without the $200.00 /50 minute session charge.

B00005JPCA|4.0|This is a movie is not perfect. It has flaws: It is too long as though, in the words of a reviewer, it does not wish to end; the ending seems disjointed from the rest of the movie; the plot has holes in it; there is little of the James Bond humor we expect; this movie with its violence is very dark. <br /> <br />But it moved me. I cared what happened and how the movie ended. And the reason was the very good acting, the actual development of character, at times some sparkling dialogue, and several exceptional action scenes that rival in realism the best of the classic Bond films in the 1960s. <br /> <br />As far as the acting, Craig is simply the best James Bond since Sean Connery. He can act, and he can handle the action scenes--the fight scenes here approach Connery's best (though the all-time best is the fight between Bond and Grant in From Russia With Love).  <br /> <br />Eva Green, having played anything but the stereotypical Bond girl, need not worry about being stereotyped. She is stunningly beautiful, but in a classic French-English way, and at times reminds one of the French actress Isabelle Adjani. Her opening scene when she meets Bond on the train contains perhaps the best dialogue in any James Bond film. Look at her scenes on the train, in the shower, and at the lakeside home where Bond is recovering from his torture, and you'll see a female character in the series not seen before, topping I think even Diana Rigg's character in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the movie along with From Russia With Love with which Casino Royale has most in common. For an actress so young, Green is simply wonderful. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the older Bond movies, you will like Casino Royale, which I think is the best Bond movie since OHMSS, made some 36 years ago. If your idea of a James Bond movie is wild gadgets, explosion after explosion (though this movie has some), the typical James Bond one-liner humor, outlandish villians, the fate of the world at risk, a happy ending, and women seen in last year's Playboy (though Catarina Murino could qualify), then you will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Flawed? Yes. But I still enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br />
0439813786|5.0|I bought this to read to my students and read it first myself, of course, to be sure it was appropriate. I loved it and now am trying to figure how to read it to them as the pictures are such an important part of the story and would be hard to share as they are intended. This book is like a graphic novel/great story/movie come to life/motion picture history book all rolled into one...I loved it and know children of all ages will as well!
0783114893|5.0|This is one of my favorite's in the thriller/suspense category. If you are a fan of this type of movie, then this is a must have. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, you will not want to pause this one !
1400079179|2.0|I confess that I waited to read this book until the hype died down so that strangers wouldn't stop me in the street, eager to discuss the book's contents in hushed tones full of awe and wonderment. Or so I assumed would be my fate if I dared parade in public with a book so full of secrets in the heyday of the Da Vinci Code hype. There seems to be some truth to the myth -- the girl at my local Starbucks did ask if I was reading it again (I told her no, it was my first time). Of course, she's no stranger, as my addiction to Frappucinos and chocolate croissants has oft diverted me to that corporate palace of guilty pleasure. So I guess my mission -- avoiding the hype -- was a success.<br /><br />So what was the hype about?<br /><br />Well, frankly -- something that's not that impressive.<br /><br />The story revolves around Robert Langdon, a symbologist of some renown, and Sophie Neveu, a young cryptologist in the French Judicial Police force. The curator of the Louvre has been murdered, but managed to leave behind a mysterious message, and Robert and Sophie together must uncover its meaning. Themselves suspected of the murder, they must hide themselves and the secret entrusted them while navigating a tangled web of loyalties and delving into ancient secrets of the Church. Dodging police, secret sects and societies, and friends turned enemies, Sophie and Robert must find the heart of the secret the Church would kill to silence -- or discover for itself.<br /><br />The novel is fast-paced and rife with archaeological and architectural details and mini-lectures on symbology, cryptography, and history. The story has a tendency to tease, building up to a revelation and then quickly cutting away to some other part of the story, making the reader wait and turn page after page to discover the next secret. Though Sophie and Robert hog the spotlight, from the very start the novel also collects points of view from various allies, enemies, and secondary and minor characters. Besides wandering from person to person, the novel also skips around in time a bit, quite suddenly delving into conveniently timed flashbacks provided by various characters and just as suddenly jumping back into the main narrative. Such devices usually serve to develop suspense, enrich a narrative and round out the cast, providing inflections of motivation, insights from different characters, and background and back story. However, successfully mixing all of these together -- information dumps on obscure fields of study, coy withholding of information, frequent jumps in point of view, flashbacks in the middle of the narrative -- requires a grace and balance that Dan Brown honestly lacks.<br /><br />Let's start with the suspense. The point of a suspense novel is to intrigue and disturb the reader to the point that they must know what happens next -- to unravel the mystery, to settle their own minds, to assure themselves that it all ends well, or at least that it all ends. Truly successful suspense is subtle, pulling gently and insistently on the reader's string, teasing them with merciless grace. Okay, so maybe my standards are high, but I'm pretty sure that by anyone's standard of subtlety, on a scale from \\"barely noticeable\\" to \\"slapped in the face with a brick\\", The Da Vinci Code rates somewhere around \\"like a speeding train careening towards the helpless SUV stalled on the tracks, honking madly\\". It's a pet peeve, I guess: I don't appreciate being forcibly led around by the nose. Aside from my personal dislike for overly obvious suspense, I do believe this was an honest narrative failure. True, the device Brown uses -- repeatedly, constantly -- of leading you by the hand (and I'll get to his problem with hand-holding narration in a minute) right up to the threshold of the next big revelation and then slamming the door in your face and going \\"Neener, neener, gotta read on to find out!\\" worked. I turned the pages, I read the book. I wanted to know what in God's name the fuss was about. But it was so awkward, so obvious, and, possibly worst of all, so unnecessary. It was also inconsistent. Some of the biggest revelations of the entire story were disgorged in tremendous information dumps stitched right into the narrative, while many tiny or less important mysteries simply had to be cut away from right before the climax. And when the information was finally revealed, a flashback and three POV switches later, my reaction about half the time was, \\"...So what?\\"<br /><br />The story itself is interesting and suspenseful, but it seems Dan Brown was either very insecure about his plot or just plain lacking grace. On its own steam, with fewer glaringly obvious suspense-cuts and a more subtle handling overall, the story would have been far more successful at intrigue, mystery, and that wonderful feeling of aching to know more. As it stands, the cuts are jarring, frustrating, and often unnecessary or poorly placed.<br /><br />While the use of suspense-cuts in the main narrative was rather annoying, what really stuck out for me was their use in flashbacks. The incongruous chopping up of stream-of-consciousness thought to serve the purpose of manufacturing suspense was extremely awkwardly handled. Since the story is told in third person personal, the reader expects flashback to be memories, often involuntarily recalled, and just cutting them off right as the narrative approaches the core of the memory felt jarring and very artificial. Instead of helping me to sympathize with the character and learn more about them, such cuts jarred me right of of rapport with the POV character.<br /><br />Speaking of rapport with characters, there really wasn't much of that to spread around. Sadly, the characters for whom I often felt most sympathy, whose story affected me most, were a handful of minor and secondary characters making cameo appearances -- they were the only ones with any charm or mystery to them. This was due largely to a ridiculous imbalance of telling over showing. Just as Dan Brown led me forcibly through the jarring leaps of his suspense, so does he hold my hand through the characters' motivations and characterizations. Perhaps the author was attempting to affect that sparse, frank style that makes suspense novels like The Silence of the Lambs so effective. If this was the case, then Brown missed the most important point: part of the fun, part of the entire idea of a mystery or suspense is to make readers work for it. That's what makes the genre a success: adrenaline highs and the thrill of participation -- guessing the answers, mentally yelling at the characters to turn back, don't open that door, don't believe his lies. While Brown's bald revelation of every character's motivations makes for easy, obvious reading, he has deprived his readers of the experience of trying to understand for themselves. It's much more satisfying to solve a problem on your own than to be told the answer, isn't it? Teasing out a character's motivations is a tremendous part of getting to know them well enough to love or hate them -- the key to pulling an emotional response from the reader. This is the ultimate goal of writing for me, and Dan Brown, with his ham-handed approach to characterization, has failed at it utterly.<br /><br />Of course, not all the cards can be played so close in a suspense novel. Another tenet of the genre is the teaching of lore, particulars, and specialties. Detective work and mystery-solving of most kinds involves specialized knowledge and learning the secrets of trades is usually a large part of the enjoyment derived from the mystery genre. And there is plenty of that kind of lore in this book, and it's surprisingly well-handed -- sometimes. About half of the information dumps come from character dialogue, and these are usually engaging, informative, and fit well into the narrative around them. The other half, however, comes from the narrative itself, and is awkward yet interesting at best. Thetransition to pedagogical exposition is often jarring and comes out of nowhere, and again suffers from a surfeit of the obvious. As an example, there a number of times where a character performs an action that is habitual for them, and yet the narrative goes through the trouble of explaining the ritual or procedure in detail. In such an intimate third-person narrative, why in the world would characters' thoughts digress into pondering in detail, for no reason, something they do every day? There are better ways to handle the need to trickle information to the reader. Such digressions are more forgivable in Robert's case -- he is, after all, a professor and a teacher first, and this is one for the few character traits conveyed with any degree of charm. Though never stated literally, his quiet delight in teaching and in his field of study is the one bit of characterization that managed to get from the page to my head without Dan Brown standing in the way pointing at it and waving his arms about.<br /><br />That said, the information itself was interesting as it was revealed. I won't go into discussing the alleged balance of fact and fiction in the book -- I'm viewing it as a work of literature, and that's all. Whatever the degree of truth to the various conspiracy theories featured here, they are at first glance intriguing and plausible. The descriptions of artwork, architecture, symbology, cryptology, and history, while often awkwardly delivered, do well to intrigue, entice, and induce wonder. However, after a constant bombardment of the importance of the central secret of the story and how it was the main motivation for most of the characters, by the time the end of the novel approached I found myself caring about it surprisingly little. The tidbits of information, true or false, were indeed interesting, but prolonged exposure wore away the shine of the most important one.<br /><br />Aside from almost complete failure in the four most common elements on the novel's storytelling (suspense, flashbacks, character POVs, and information dumps), there's also a grab bag of remaining points. The descriptions were hit-or-miss, sometimes descending into the dreamy amethyst realm of purple prose, and once in a startling while hitting an idea square on the head with no frills or fancy but plenty of image to carry it along. The author was also prone to a peculiar grammatical device wherein a description would trail off with an ellipsis... only to reveal something startling or deep! Or so I assume was the intended effect. It occurred frequently in the first chapters of the book then dropped off, thankfully. Its overuse in the beginning was a distraction. There was a sprinkling of plot points both yawn-inducingly predictable and honestly surprising.

As an example, there a number of times where a character performs an action that is habitual for them, and yet the narrative goes through the trouble of explaining the ritual or procedure in detail. In such an intimate third-person narrative, why in the world would characters' thoughts digress into pondering in detail, for no reason, something they do every day? There are better ways to handle the need to trickle information to the reader. Such digressions are more forgivable in Robert's case -- he is, after all, a professor and a teacher first, and this is one for the few character traits conveyed with any degree of charm. Though never stated literally, his quiet delight in teaching and in his field of study is the one bit of characterization that managed to get from the page to my head without Dan Brown standing in the way pointing at it and waving his arms about.    That said, the information itself was interesting as it was revealed. I won't go into discussing the alleged balance of fact and fiction in the book -- I'm viewing it as a work of literature, and that's all. Whatever the degree of truth to the various conspiracy theories featured here, they are at first glance intriguing and plausible. The descriptions of artwork, architecture, symbology, cryptology, and history, while often awkwardly delivered, do well to intrigue, entice, and induce wonder. However, after a constant bombardment of the importance of the central secret of the story and how it was the main motivation for most of the characters, by the time the end of the novel approached I found myself caring about it surprisingly little. The tidbits of information, true or false, were indeed interesting, but prolonged exposure wore away the shine of the most important one.    Aside from almost complete failure in the four most common elements on the novel's storytelling (suspense, flashbacks, character POVs, and information dumps), there's alsoa grab bag of remaining points. The descriptions were hit-or-miss, sometimes descending into the dreamy amethyst realm of purple prose, and once in a startling while hitting an idea square on the head with no frills or fancy but plenty of image to carry it along. The author was also prone to a peculiar grammatical device wherein a description would trail off with an ellipsis... only to reveal something startling or deep! Or so I assume was the intended effect. It occurred frequently in the first chapters of the book then dropped off, thankfully. Its overuse in the beginning was a distraction. There was a sprinkling of plot points both yawn-inducingly predictable and honestly surprising.

B000021Y77|5.0|There are very few films that become instant cult classics such as Godard's 1960 Breathless and the less-than-brilliant Pulp Fiction by Tarantino. Run Lola Run in many aspects tops both these movies in its ability to take an incredibly simple plot and turn it into an exgtravaganza of motion, sound and film-making showmanship that redefines filmography and becomes a genre of its own.     Run Lola Run is a brilliant combination of a very talented cast, extremely creative writing and masterful video and sound editing, which results in one of the greatest masterpieces in modern moviemaking history. I am not getting carried away!    Although the movie is sparse with words, it does an incredible job at providing a unique perspective into the characters lives, sometimes with a single sentence or even just a sequence of camera snapshots:   Lola's mother's only sentence in the movie while holding a glass of wine, talking on the phone from home: \\"clearly, I knew your ascendant was Sagittarius.... But you are married too\\".     Lola's relationship with her father:   Lola: \\"if I can't get the money, Manni will die\\".   Father: \\"Who is Manni?\\"  Lola: \\"My boyfriend for a year now\\".    We also get a glimpse into random characters' lives through a sequence of camera snapshots, sometimes in a humorous way, all interweaving into the main theme which is the stage and play that we're all part of and how sequences of events change the outcome of the end of the play.    Along the plot line there are several humorous winks and tributes to other movies and books which arguably provided some inspiration to parts of the movie. For instance, Lola's ability to shatter glass with her voice is a direct tribute to German author Gunter Grass's The Tin Drum. A silent scene at the casino provides a tribute to Apocalypse Now. The 3 tries plot may have been inspired by Fritz Lang's 1922 Der Mude Tod, etc.    Regardless if you recognize these tributes, Run Lola Run is a captivating movie where every frame and every note of sound seem to be perfectly orchestrated by a maestro who is conducting this fast paced, brilliant symphony.    Film making at its best! Savor it!
6304712936|5.0|Milos Forman's \\"Amadeus\\" is the fictional story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his bitter rival Antonio Salieri. The movie swept the Academy Award ceremony the year of its release, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, and five others and it holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#53). This is odd for a movie about classical music that features a lot of opera singing in it. For me, the most appealing thing about the film is the two lead performances. F. Murray Abraham (as Salieri) and Tom Hulce (as Mozart). Throughout the film, Salieri is a sympathetic character despite the fact that he's a jealous, only quasi-talented man jealous of someone else's gifts. Meanwhile, Mozart is the character we should feel for and yet, throughout the whole movie (until the end), we want to kick him in the face. The movie opens many years after Mozart has died and Salieri, a once great composer, tries to commit suicide claiming he killed Mozart. The rest of the film is a flashback, as Salieri tells a priest the story. A story about how he longed for greatness and then saw the most brilliant musician of all time in the form of Mozart, a young man with an obnoxious personality and an annoying laugh. Salieri is jealous that these great gifts have been bestowed on such an immature person, he begins plotting to kill Mozart...But not until he's acquired some of the man's final writings. Anyway, enough with the synopsis because I'm pretty sure you've already heard it anyway. The movie is, obviously, a period piece and it does have lavish costumes and people writing with feathers. I know a good many people who won't watch a movie for those reasons, but \\"Amadeus\\" feels extraordinarily modern. Forman, a Czechoslovakian director who made films there and then came to America to great success, is a great director and this film is one of his greatest triumphs. It's funny, has great dialogue, and the performances are (once again) DYNAMITE! Even though Abraham won the Academy Award, Hulce could have just as easily scooped it up. I think, in the end, it's not that one performance is better than the other...It's just that Hulce is really annoying and Abraham is just incredible. Even people who aren't fans of Mozart (I've never listened to him myself) or aren't fans of these kinds of movies, I promise that you won't regret watching this film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
0743298020|3.0|I was fully prepared to give this 4 1/2 stars at the beginning for the writing alone, but as the novel progressed, it fell apart. I appreciate what the author was trying to do, but the problem with one person telling another person's story was that there was too much narrative, and this was increasingly broken into by the first storyteller (Margaret) so that the book ended up feeling like it had been pasted together. Much as I enjoyed the all-too-short Hester episode, I found the later inclusion of her diary irritating--and another example of the author over-explaining the story. Parts of it were too melodramatic, and the end went on too long. And then...a postcriptum! It's as though the author (or editor) couldn't bear to let the book go, whereas elements throughout might have worked better left to the imagination. I could see the doctor/Margaret relationship coming a mile off. I didn't, however, anticipate the third sister and am not sure it added anything much except to convolute the plot unnecessarily. The ambiguity of there being a ghost at Angelfield House would have been just as satisfactory (for me). Adeline could have been the transformed twin fighting an evil presence, saving her sister and the baby, and then going on to become Vida Winter writing to forget her incestful origins and insane ancestors. As a whole, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" put me in mind of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" in that it starts out as a literary quasi-supernatural work and decends into commercial sentimentality. It has inspired me to reread \\"Wuthering Heights\\" though...
B000L212HC|5.0|The Prestige is a wonderful example of how cinema is supposed to be made. Academy nominaded for Cinamatography is a true tribute to the tone of the film. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale bounce off each other great and Michael Caine in the middle makes it work even better. The film really shines in its directorial vision of Christopher Nolan. Some of you might know him best from \\"Batman Begins\\" but he has done great films like \\"Memento\\" and \\"Insomnia\\". He has worked with the best in the buisness and his career is just begining. Though I can't leave out his brother Jonathan Nolan who co-wrote both \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Memento\\" and of course \\"The Prestige\\" It is a definite buy for an audience who enjoys films. I can't say much more about the film that would give away any spoilers so I leave you with many reasons to see the film. Good luck and I hope you enjoy this thriller/mystery/drama.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Almost every song on this album is a winner. A few of the best songs are only available on this album, having never been put in a Greatest Hits Collection or in The Last Waltz (movie of Band's last concert). The tune, \\"Ala Glory\\" is a subtle stunner.  Regarding The Last Waltz, buy it and watch/listen to the greatest band in rock n' roll history--no hyperbole, The Band is the one musical entity or person that can truly be called GREAT.

B00002SSKI|5.0|As much as I hate 'chick flicks' this one is an old favorite. I grew up with this movie, and it taught me that I was not alone as a tomboy.  <br /> <br /> It's a great flick for anyone who has close friends, has ever been in a difficult situation, or anyone who has ever felt out of place.  <br /> <br /> It's just a great feel good movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
B00005QENZ|5.0|This is the third in an incredibly tasty trio of albums from the Bad Boys from Boston (\\"Permanent Vacation\\", \\"Pump\\", and \\"Get a Grip\\").  Many (most?) fans from the early days don't appreciate these releases from the band's days with Geffen Records, but I'm just as blown away by them as \\"Get Your Wings\\", \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\" from their Columbia Records era.<br /><br />Again, many current concert staples, like \\"Eat the Rich\\", \\"Livin' on the Edge\\", and \\"Cryin'\\".  But, also, some other great rockers like the title cut, \\"Fever\\", \\"Flesh\\", \\"Shut Up and Dance\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"Line Up\\" and \\"Amazing\\".  This was Aerosmith at their MTV best.  Now approaching 40 years together, and truly better than ever in concert.  Rock on dudes!
B00004RF8J|5.0|I have nothing but respect for the puppeteers who controlled dear Audrey II. That plant ran the show, no doubt about it.  <br /> <br /> As musicals go this is one of the greatest, only second to Rocky Horror. <br /> <br />Rick Moranis is brilliant, and Ellen Greene has such an amazingly deep voice for such a tiny woman.  <br /> <br />The three women singing throughout the movie gave me chills with every note. The vocal in this film are surprising and beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story itself is brilliantly funny and horrific, it will have you laughing and cowering at the same time. <br /> <br /> A true classic and worth watching...again, and again and again. <br /> <br />

B000LC55F2|1.0|A show with a poorly written plot.  Poor acting with unrealistic accents.  I was hoping this show would end, but it keeps on going and going like the energizer bunny. Don't know which else to say, it was just another show that's boring.

0446528056|3.0|Before I comment, I would like to say that I admire Nicholas Sparks as a writer.  However, I'm not sure that I'm going to continue buying and reading his work.  Message in a Bottle, A Bend in the Road, Dear John, to name just a few--why do his stories have to be so tragic?  The last thing I want to do after a long, hectic day is to sit down to read and relax at night and open a book and read about tragedy, heartbreak and sadness.  Dear John--and I'm sure I won't get a popular vote for it--grated on me because one, I felt like I was reading a diary-John's diary-Savannah was about as pure as the driven snow and John actually, really let her go knowing he would love her forever?  Frankly, I think Tim should have let her go in the end or maybe she should have written him a Dear Tim letter and gone back to John.  I am aware of the message in the book but come on--if there's a person you love with a passion and she loves you right back are you really going to walk away?  At any rate, there's enough sadness in the world and I really rather prefer books with a happier ending--feel good books.  Not these depressing, sad ones.
B00005JPLU|5.0|Who are all these whack jobs talking about \\"Oh, the historically accurate depiction\\", & \\"cuts to the core of what is coursing through the veins and psyches of any man in touch with his human soul\\"?  Seriously people, it's time to get a life.  We all know you're god's gift to critiquing film, but it's time to get over yourselves.  However cool \\"300\\" maybe, it's still based on a comic book & made by the same guys behind both \\"Sin City\\" & the new \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" so anyone looking for \\"historical accuracy\\" & \\"human soul\\" may wanna look elsewhere, or at least have their head checked.<br /><br />Now, a more accurate description of \\"300\\" would be that it's \\"Absolutely the most accute depiction of Bad-Assery ever captured on film\\".  This is just absolutely the ulitmate guy movie & makes you wanna go punch puppies & kick down trees afterwards.  Even the aforementioned \\"Dudity\\" (coined by another far supeior reviewer over at ainticool.com to describe male nudity)was tollerable.  As far as the people complaining about the violence; c'mon?  While there is alot, it's all so cartoony & over the top it's more eye candy than anything else.  I can't imagine anyone not totally & completely enjoying this movie.  Frank Miller is finally receiving the credit he's been due all these years.  Just go see the movie.
B000003TA4|1.0|Just as Guns & Roses represents the most overrated band of the 80's, here is your dose of the most OVERRATED album of the 90's and overall bands in general.    I am sorry but I just don't get it.  My only take is that the late 80's got so bogged down and stale with the everywhere hair bands that anything new and angry sounding would be refreshing.    Sure, it was the springboard to a whole new genre' in music, but then again, most of that 90's alternative movement was a bunch of garbage to begin with anchored by bands with zero staying power....(Hello Bush, Cake, Marcy Playground, Offspring, Candlebox, Sponge, Soul Asylum).  Blech, what a terrible time.  And to make matters worse, 90's alternative has an even shorter period of relevance and then the boy-band and Britney Spears pop comes along to kill the grunge period in the late 90's.    Aside from Pearl Jam, Green Day, and perhaps Radiohead, this is a largely forgettable musical period.  Sorry Mr. Cobain but I can't heap the praise and worship that others do.
B000AZLK8G|5.0|This is Batman as it should be. Dark, sinister from beginning to end, and the hero wins only to lose after all. The movie is dark and selfish, like the town that Batman protects. There is no sequel. There is only delay, while we wait, and wonder whether we will be treated to another helping, this time with Batman's most infamous (and dangerous) of enemies - his nemesis, the joker.<br /><br />The previous Batman movies were bright and colorful, much like the old Batman television series, with interesting sets and villains, but with each movie (and each new Batman) it became more of a Sunday cartoon and less a cinematic vision of the Dark Knight. With the return of the bat (Batman Begins) we have seemingly wiped the slate clean. Here is the new prince of (darkness) the city, the forlorn and brooding hero who hides his identity through his alter ego: the charming, friendly, and somewhat arrogant Bruce Wayne. Batman is once again the star of the movie, not the costume, the sets, or the celebrity villains. Batman (even before there is a costume) evolves before us, a man filled with rage and disgust with his home, a warrior seeking to become much more than a single soldier in a war that transcends his lifespan. This is as it should be. Dark, unpleasant at times, and morose. There is no happy ending - only an acceptable one. That is what makes this movie so perfect. I only hope that they have finally started filming Batman Two (whatever it will be titled) while we still have Michael Caine with us as Alfred.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|When Los Angeles workaholic Amanda breaks up with her boyfriend, she needs a place where she can go and take her mind off things. At the same time, British newspaper journalist Iris realizes that she will never live happily ever after with the ex-boyfriend she's been pining after for three years. The two decide to swap lives, in effect, and each live in the other's home for two weeks.<br /><br />In the beginning, Amanda thinks she's made a mistake and books herself a flight back to La La Land. Then enters Iris's charming older brother, Graham, who sweeps Amanda off her feet in what she expects to be a one-night stand but turns out to be much more. Iris, on the other hand, has a great time in Los Angeles from the very beginning and makes friends with an elderly screenwriter who is Amanda's neighbor. Their friendship forms the foundation that allows her to forget about her ex and move on with her life.<br /><br />The Holiday is, as other reviewers have noted, two romantic comedies in one. Cameron Diaz is endearingly neurotic as the workaholic Amanda who is so busy running a successful business she doesn't have time to have sex with her boyfriend. When she meets Graham and finally allows herself to let her guard down, it was a perfect romantic comedy moment complete with the complicated plot twist (which I won't give away, but let's just say Graham's been keeping secrets). Similarly, Iris lets herself be walked on by the object of her affection for so long that she forgets that she does deserve to be loved back by someone who will appreciate her. The relationship that she forms with Amanda's neighbor gives her the gumption to finally stand up for herself and stop being a doormat. This movie was a cute and funny romantic comedy, and my only complaint is that--at over 2 hours--it was a bit longer than I expected or was necessary. Other than that, it was enjoyable and entertaining.<br /><br />Also, I originally thought The Holiday must have been based on the Jane Green novel Swapping Lives, which has a similar home exchange between a Brit and an American, but since the two were released within six months of each other, I guess that's not the case. Still, if you enjoy this film, you might want to check out Swapping Lives for a different perspective on the same story.een novel Swapping Lives, which has a similar home exchange between a Brit and an American, but since the two were released within six months of each other, I guess that's not the case.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I went to see this in the theater after admittedly avoiding it for a few weeks. It was not that I didn't want to know. I just didn't want to be depressed. I had heard great things about the film, how clear and eloquent the arguments were, but the image my mind conjured of sitting through two to three hours of depressing \\"I told you so's\\" was just enough for me to hesitate. I finally decided that I wanted to see it and that nothing should stop me. I was floored by how entertaining this film actually was. Al Gore has developed a stage personality over the past few years, and it is brazenly on display in this film.<br /><br />I was also surprised at the pains he takes throughout the film to avoid assigning blame [on the current administration presumably] and how he endeavors to clarify each issue and the complex math it takes to reach the conclusions set forth in this film. It is fantastically directed, and moves forward at a brisk pace unheard of in most documentaries. I had expected either a dry, snorefest of facts and doomsday predictions or something along the line of Michael Moore's documentary a few years back. I have rarely been so delighted to be so wrong.<br /><br />This movie is more than a must-see because of the message it carries. It is a wonderful example of how educational film can be entertaining as well. The steps Mr. Gore lays out at the end of the film are easy enough to consider, and therein lies the greatest hope - that we can actually (and easily) do something about this problem.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|I have always enjoyed Will Smith's movies (I missed \\"Wild Wild West\\" so I dodged the bullet on that), but I was astounded at how deeply moving this movie was. His portrayal of a man fighting against poverty, and burdened by having a family on top of that was eerily convincing. I have a good friend who is a successful author who went through much of the same. Living out of his car, showering daily at the gym, working every day and writing at coffeehouses every night, basically doing whatever it took to stay alive and create a better future, while doing everything he could to keep anyone from finding out that he was homeless. Now he has a line of successful books and helps out others who are in need.<br /><br />To me this is more than a movie about someone overcoming adversity: this is a message of hope to anyone who is able to see this movie and realize that they are not alone, and not unable to change the future. I did some research and found the numbers of people living in their cars, vans, station wagons, and RV's in America is staggering. These people work next to us, go to movies, read books, pay taxes, and in every way are citizens, except for their ability to afford rent. Living in Los Angeles I know how expensive real estate is in California. Not every job pays enough to afford even a small apartment, but someone needs to make our espressos and  Big Macs or our way of living would cease. Knowing this makes this movie so much more poignant, so much more of a social commentary that it is not easy being poor, and even harder pulling yourself out of poverty when so many simply give in and accept it. But it gives hope to those who need it most. I applaud Will Smith for making a movie with this gravity in between his more action-oriented projects.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|If you already bought the DVD, then you're not actually missing that much. But if you still have your money inside your pockets (or if you're a hardcore fan of Final Fantasy VII), then you definitely want to go with this one. <br />The 2 DVDs at their core, are essentially the exact same thing as the normal DVD edition, with the exception that the 2nd DVD includes Final Fantasy VII: Last Order this time around. If you haven't heard of Last Order, it's an animé short movie that happens before the events of the PlayStation hit, right before Zack and Cloud reach Midgar. The short movie mainly focuses on Zack, who was Cloud's best friend during his days in SOLDIER. This clip serves as the prelude to Square Enix's upcoming PSP title, Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core. I mean, even the art style is THE SAME as Crisis Core's, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The only bad thing in Last Order is Last Order itself. The story is complete and utter garbage. It exagerates the events that actually DID take place in Final Fantasy VII (namely, the fight that happened between Cloud and Sephiroth in Nibelheim, after Sephiroth discovers the true origin of his super-human strength). The result of this exageration of events is a clip that looks not only stupid, but actually INSULTS the magnificence of the beloved PlayStation classic. But hey, a crappy bonus is better than no bonus at all! <br />Moving on, this package includes 10 very nice postcards, some which were designed exclusively for these postcards. That's a great bonus! <br />It also includes the actual script of the movie, but what really will catch your attention is the book that comes besides the script. It's a 72 page long booklet that contains side-stories on some of the characters. These short stories happen before the events of Advent Children, and one thing that really caught my eye, is that it explains how Denzel came to be with Cloud and Tifa. Really neat stuff, fellas. Even the box in which all this stuff comes isespecially cool and it makes it look all artsy and classy, hehe. <br />So the bottomline is, if you haven't bought Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children already, buy this one. If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy VII fan, buy this one. And if you already bought FFVII: AC already, then sell your normal edition copy, and buy this one.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The best cinematic version of Jane Eyre ever produced.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens have electrifying chemistry.  Wilson has found a way into the real heart of the character of Jane, and her portrayal of Bronte's heroine reaches into the deepest part of the human emotional well.  Stephens portrayal of the self-deprecating Edward Rochester is raw and emotionally charged, leaving you wanting so much more.  He creates an aura of rugged charm about him.  Masterpiece Theatre has lived up to its name in creating another masterpiece that not only preserves the timeless quality of the story, but also reminds its audience of the value of the story even in the 21st century.  Bravo.

Songs like \\"I Love It Loud\\", \\"New York Groove\\", \\"I Stole Your Love\\" and \\"God Gave Rock and Roll\\" are true KISS staples that are often lacking on their other hits CDs.<br /><br />If a KISS newbie is willing to spend up to $40, you could truly get the very best of KISS by picking up 3 CDs: \\"KISS Gold\\", \\"20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Kiss, Vol. 2\\", and \\"Revenge\\".  These 3 CDs contain every essential KISS song from 1974 thru 1992 -- including everything found on here.<br /><br />But for this low price and great song selection, it's really hard to go wrong with The Very Best of KISS.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is so delightful.  It has every element that a film should have: laughter, tears, reflections on your own life.  Made on a bare-bones budget, the actors are forced to rely on a solid script that carves out real people.  There is a little of all of us in each of these characters.  And just watching their everyday struggle is an inspiration.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|I agree with the prior review a lot. A much more quiet record, bordering on a very 70s soft/lite rock album. That said, there is a huge infusion of Nels Cline jazziness that makes it at times King Crimson. There is something very new to this record that has never happened on prior Wilco albums: noodling.  <br /> <br />As for how these songs play live... based on the the show I saw in Octoberish 2006, they play quite well. I just wish they had have also included 'The Thanks I Get' becuase it's a great song. But it doesn't fit the rest of the record.
0307276902|1.0|People who have reviewed that the poor guy was given a bad rap because he \\"embellished\\" have not read the facts. <br /> <br />James Frey, himself, admits the entire book is a LIE.  He made up time spent in re-hab, he made up going to prison, he made up killing an officer, he made up having a drug problem!!!  He was a spoiled little rich kid who drank a few beers with his fraternity brothers.   <br /> <br />It DOES make a difference that this book is a lie.  99% of why this book is inspirational is because the reader assumes it is true!  Over and over in the book, he says his life is dedicated to telling the truth.  Meanwhile, Frey has admitted all of it was a lie.  His message was if he can do it, so can you.  But in fact he never did anything!  It's as inspirational as Snow White! <br /> <br />The man should be imprisoned!
1582701709|1.0|Really the negative reviews are right here. It's a dangerous way to view the world. Blaming the victim of a crime and saying they were thinking it would happen, therefore it happened is crazy. I'm all for positive thinking. I think that message is great. But, this book is NOT good. It's not even well written or really that informative.
1582701709|5.0|A must read for everyone. It will change your life. I bought the book & the DVD.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best version of Jane Eyre I've seen, perhaps because this Mr. Rochester rivals the Mr. Darcy of A&E's Pride and Prejudice in lust inducing fantasies. Well, I don't think Mr. Darcy has been bested yet, but this Mr. Rochester certainly fills in nicely for him in a pinch. =)<br /><br />This Jane is also perfect in the role.  This is definitely a keeper!
B00020HEL6|5.0|This girl has a fantastic voice, you will be sure to love this CD. This has quickly become my favorite CD. You will think you are in a swanky lounge back in the day.
B000NA28IE|1.0|Perhaps when the Eragon series has been around as long as the Lord of the Ring series, someone will give it a more devoted treatment as a movie.  This one is laughably bad, however.  Stick with the books.  I also highly recommend the unabridged book on CD. The reader does a terrific job.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is my favorite TV show. Most people have probably already covered why it's awesome, but let me just say...it rules pretty hard.  <br /> <br />Fox has to be kicking themselves for canceling it, and I dunno why another network like NBC doesn't pick it up.

B000F0UUT6|5.0|I made my online purchase of the DVD for Pride and Prejudice, 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition, using the standard postage option.  My expectation was to have the product arrive within 5-7 days, at best; however, to my amazement, I received my purchase so quickly that I honestly thought the item was delivered the next day.  I was very pleased with the quality as well when I finally got the chance to sit down, relax and indulge myself in the warmth of the characters' portrayal--especially Colin Firth, in his role as Mr. Darcy.  Thanks Amazon!
0441009425|5.0|Alistair Reynolds work is a case study of why sci-fi should not be lumped in with fantasy.  And if your tastes run to Anne McCaffery or Ben Bova, Revelation Space will definately not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br />If you love Star Trek and Star Wars (as I do) but Asimov, Heinlein, or Clarke don't necessarily ring your bell, then you're still not likely to have much of an appetite for Reynolds.  However, if you love science on steroids with plots to match, this guy is the sci-fi equivalent of the all-you-can-eat buffet. <br /> <br />At the time of writing, Reynolds was an astrophysicist with the European Space Agency.  He holds a Ph.D. in astronomy.  This mastery of his topic shows in his fascinating and detailed scientific speculation.   <br /> <br />Reynolds penchant for intricately interwoven sub-plots to progress the overall storyline make his brand of sci-fi red meat, not light reading.   <br /> <br />(Be warned this is the first of a trilogy although fine stand alone reading.) <br /> <br />
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Although the superior \\"Batman Begins\\" reinvented, reimagined and reinvigorated Batman, this, the original, still stands alone as a very good movie. Tim Burton's ideas and vision of Gotham and the Dark Knight look great on DVD. Forget the color-laden, comic book\\"Batman Forever\\" and the horrible, unforgivable \\"Batman and Robin.\\" By-pass the box set and add this and the special two-disc edition of Burton's even darker follow-up, \\"Batman Returns\\" to your collection.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|I thought the whole band played quite excellent and Dextor played with aggression, and beauty that is unheard of in some of todays players.
B0002EJTBU|1.0|I haven't seen any of these instruments in stores, so I was happy to find a site where I could order it for myself for not too much $-- I figured, worst-case scenario, I'd be able to add it to my collection of shaker sounds.<br /><br />It arrived today, and I could pretty much tell it was not going to be useful from the sound it made shifting in its packing envelope.  I was not turned around when I took it out of its box.  Like most all of the Afro/Pearl percussion products I've come across, it IS well constructed, in that the materials are durable and are put together in such away that I don't think there's much chance of it falling apart.<br /><br />That said, the actual SOUNDS it makes are not good.  I find the 'shaker' side of it to be too low, metallic, harsh, and thin all at once.  A shaker of this material needs more fill and a larger chamber to be of much use.  The plastic 'caxixi bottom' surface makes a better sound, but it's still not great, and the rectangular design makes it hard to actually use like you would a basket-shaped caxixi.  (Or any other useful shaker, for that matter.)<br /><br />The platinellas (pandeiro jingles,) are OK; not of the nicest material or design, but they make the right KIND of sound, anyway.  The problems with them are:  1) it's not easy to mute them and still retain good control of the shaker, 2) when you try to shake both them AND the shaker as one you get the shake fill stopping at one speed and the platinellas stopping at another (making for a very clumsy, flammy, disjointed sound that's not at all desirable in a 'messy' way,) and 3) there is NO way to do little shaking patterns with the platinellas without getting a lot of white noise from the shaker underneath.<br /><br />This would actually be a pretty cool instrument if they just took the shaker part off and sold a rack of two sets of platinellas with a base to hold it by that you could do intricate patterns with, (maybe with one in each hand, maybe with one in one handand a GOOD shaker in the other,) but that's not what it is, nor is there even any way to convert it IN to that, as the shaker's chamber is pretty well sealed, and it's all one piece of solid metal, so detaching the top from the bottom would be more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />I like and use a lot of Afro/Pearl's products.  This one in particular is just not useful to anyone who can really get a decent sound out of shakers/and or a pandeiro.  (Not that anyone else is going to get a really GOOD sound out of it.)  If I had to guess, I would imagine the same could be said of the mini-shakerine, or either of these prodcuts' larger counterparts.  I have yet to see a combination shaker/tambourine instrument that sounds good and is truly useful, and unfortunately, this product does not change that for me.
1400043662|5.0|This was my first Murakami novel and perhaps my awe with his style and craftsmanship are reflected in the five stars I'm giving it. It's not that there's any question in my mind that this novel deserves five stars, but it seems regular Murakami readers regard this book as a weak effort and if that is so, then I have quite a treat ahead of me.<br /><br />On the surface this is a retelling of Oedipus, with Kafka playing the role of the son destined to unwittingly kill his father and marry his mother fulfilling the curse of prophecy. More deeply the book is an homage to Franz Kafka, playing masterfully with surrealist dreams and decaying realities. This is the story of the odd chapters, of Kafka the runaway, a fifteen year old in body but a wise older man within.  On the even chapters Murakami tells the magic-realism story of Mr. Nakata, an older man who'd been in a strange accident when he was fifteen that left him without the intellectual ability to read or write. It left him as a simpleton with the unique ability to communicate with cats. Nakata, man in body - boy in mind, is Kafka's polar opposite, and their lives and destiny must intertwine throughout the tale.<br /><br />Murakami analyzing the pointlessness of political positions on the liberal and conservative side of the aisle, first through a rebuttal of the feminist priorities toward a small private library where Kafka has found home and employment, and later through the voices of two Japanese soldiers who had deserted rather than fight in a war where they'd have to kill men they felt no animosity toward. The author shows the futility of forcing people to do what they don't want to do, all in the context of a story about a boy fulfilling a prophecy that he abhors.<br /><br />Of particular note in the novel was his use of music as a metaphor for the actions and abilities of people. From the Beatles to Beethoven he deconstructs musical elements and parallels them to Kafka's moral failings and coming of age redemption. Just the sheer beauty of his musical descriptions was enough to awe me with the prose as poetic as any author I can recall reading.<br /><br />It may not be Murakami's best, but it's worthy of five stars as it stands.<br /><br /> - CV Rickage redemption. Just the sheer beauty of his musical descriptions was enough to awe me with the prose as poetic as any author I can recall reading. <br /> <br />It may not be Murakami's best, but it's worthy of five stars as it stands. <br /> <br /> - CV Rick

0375505091|2.0|After seeing the exhibition (which was fantastic) the book was a sad let down for me and I returned it. Photos were cropped detroying the ambiance or the layout Leibovitz captured and aparently intended in her prints - photos were designed across a spread in such a way as interfered with the photo's integrity (one photo in particular has the page split running through the subject of the photo!). The personal photos of Sonatag in the show were very small and suggested a particular delicacy and intimacy which was lost in the book due to the relative sizing of those prints with all the others. It is a poor accompaniment to an excellent and important show of her work. If you never saw the show - you could propably let it slide - after seeing the show myself, I prefer not to have my memory tainted by an inferior product serving as representation.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|The speed of how a movie progresses is important to viewers because the producers want to keep the audience drawn into their film.  This movie progresses at a snails pace and then ending isn't the best either.  BOO!!
B000F3AAUW|2.0|I would rarely take the time to write a review on an album, but felt compelled to let the world know that this album is OVERRATED! <br />The reason why is it is INCOMPLETE. There is some good stuff here, but it is not finished. There is one track over 3-minutes on the album. They should have taken more time and added more to these tracks because they have some good components. Crazy is a good song, Smiling Face...Also Not Bad....Gone Daddy Gone-OK cover, but why bother ...Violent Femmes version is still way better. Dont bother buying this. Download these 3 tracks and your good to go. I hope they build off this album, it could have been excellent...It sounds like an incomplete Outkast album

B00005JPG1|5.0|\\"Why?\\"  That's the response from Robert Graysmith's frightened and increasingly estranged wife to the above statement and the fixation it represents.  Why indeed?  Because just as the newspapers, police and citizenry of Northern California had been siezed by the terror and frustration of the random murders perpetrated by the elusive, self-proclaimed Zodiac, Graysmith's interest in discovering his identity has turned into all-consuming obsession.  And we come to this moment only in the last third of this movie, as the leadup to this has been a fascinating police procedural unfolding with the same mistaken assumptions, false leads, jurisdictional problems (several different counties and investigations proceeding in unknowing parallel), and missed opportunities that occurred in the real case.    I say \\"fascinating\\" because I found it so.  I have a fondness for films depicting how professionals go about their business, and I have great admiration for David Fincher's exploration of the day-to-day wear and tear it exerts upon those involved in the agonizingly slow and painstaking work required trying to capture a taunting, headline-hungry, cruel and despicable monster like the Zodiac.  However, if you are looking for a thriller such as Fincher's own \\"7even\\" you should give this a pass, as he is after different elements here.    It is a long film at plus 2-1/2 hrs, but I was thoroughly engrossed in the atmosphere and tension of the film.  I remember this period (60's-70's), and Fincher's evocation of San Francisco, the city and its culture then, is spot on.  I found his camera perspectives and framing coming at this material from all sorts of angles, high and low, over and around, far and near, both smooth and fresh. Yet his style doesn't overwhelm the detailed and intricate telling of the story, but rather enhances it.      The cast is first rate in all departments, and it would be unfair to single out any of the leads as this is true ensemble work. Let me just echo someother reviewers in stating that Mark Ruffalo as the true-life Inspector Steve McQueen modeled Bullitt on and Anthony Edwards as his less colorful but solid partner, Robert Downey's flamboyant, talented but self-destructing reporter, and finally Gyllenhaal's increasingly compulsive cartoonist all have fine scenes, well done. Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigney, Charles Fleischer and John Carroll Lynch all do solid supporting work.     Working from factual material including the eponymous book Graysmith ultimately produced about the case, Fincher has created an intricate and complex look at the spell cast by a vile celebrity-seeking, notorious monster/nobody whose apprehension is always just beyond reach. He tells a big story with deftness and great craft.  It won't be a film for everyone, but I was in it for this one to the end.  Movies are as long as they need to be, and this one is no exception, and considering they have telescoped nearly two decades of this pursuit into less than three hours, Fincher and company have done so with energy and imagination.

0778321606|5.0|This is the first book by Debbie McComber that I've read. The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of Lydia Hoffman, who  has overcome cancer and now realizes her dream by opening a shop in Seattle called A Good Yarn. Her father, who was her rock during her cancer battle, has died, so she is scared but determined to succeed in this venture. She knows her father would have encouraged and cheered her on. Her first three customers couldn't be more different, they have come to the classes for reasons of their own which don't necessarily include learning how to knit. As these three women learn how to knit and watch their first project, their baby blankets take shape, they find themselves easing into friendships. They soon begin to help each other with their projects as well as with the different issues that affect their lives. Lydia too, grows and matures; she becomes a stronger person as she gradually learns the business, overcomes a second cancer scare, and  attempts a reconciliation with her older sister. She also begins a tentative romance with the handsome parcel delivery man. By the end of the book we find the 4 women forming lasting friendships and we hope that we will see them again in a new book.   <br /> <br /> .

I would recommend this to anyone who has a son/nephew/etc who is into airplanes.

B00031TXBI|5.0|This was the fifth John Frusciante album that I got and I must say it was definitely not a disappointment. He goes for a much harder rocking sound than  he usually does, and it works really well. It was just another example of how he heads in a different direction with each album but it's still the signature Frusciante style. The ten tracks are incredible, and I would honestly buy this CD just for the song Look On. Amazing guitar solo. You should definitely get this album!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Words fail me; this is just a classic great movie!

B000J3EEBY|2.0|I am a big fan of Loreena, but I have to say that most of the songs of this album are very repetitive and dull. You can hear the same melody over and over. Most of the songs are very long and hearing the same melody all the time makes everything very boring. On the other hand, I don't know why they decided to add drums to most of the songs. It breaks all the magic atmosphere of her previous albums.     Very disappointed.

B000KX0IOK|5.0|I'm not much of a film goer--although I certainly love films--but I took the trek into NYC to see this film.  I'm certainly glad I did!  This is a beautifully crafted film expertly written and directed by Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden.  The smallness of this film makes it breathtaking.  I saw it on the big screen somewhere in the Village, and the close-up shots and the quiet dialogue remind me of why screenwriters and directors can often be considered geniuses.  I think many times people involved in films are ridiculous in their view of themselves and their talent, but the people involved in the making of this film are excluded from negative criticism on any level.  I hope Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden will someday look at my novel and decide they'd like to make it into a screenplay.  If they do, it will be a masterpiece much like HALF NELSON certainly is.  A great, great film.

B000M4RG42|4.0|While the film has excellent production qualities and a great effort by cast and crew, it suffers from a needless scene shifting which will confuse most average under 30 American viewers. As most Americans alive today don't have a clue about the bloody events on Iwo Jima in 1945, Eastwood gets trapped in the notion of doing confusing scene shifts with the characters. Instead, he should have stayed with the traditional time progressive style of directing. People today get too confused with jumping around characters and events, messing with the natural time line of events. <br />Great special effects, a major epic that just misses the mark of being a classic. It is not well known, but Eastwood directed basically two films at one time: 'Flags of Our Fathers' and the Japanese side of things 'Letters from Iwo Jima' which must have been a daunting task even for old Clint.  <br />A fitting film tribute to a host of very brave men, men doing their duty to the utmost on both sides of the bayonet. <br />Semper Fi

B000G7PNAE|5.0|Released in 1981,\\"Escape\\" rose to #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart on the strength of its monster Top 10 hits \\"Don't Stop Believin\\",\\"Who's Crying Now\\" and the perfect 80's power ballad \\"Open Arms\\"(#2 for 6 weeks),selling over 9 millon copies in the process.It all makes sense because it pefectly symbolizies Journey's brand of melodic AOR rock,with great rockers like \\"Stone In Love\\"(a classic-rock radio fav),\\"Lay It Down\\" and \\"Escape\\" meshing well with slow songs like \\"Still They Ride\\"(a minor Top 20 hit) and \\"Mother,Father\\".The 2006 reissue pairs the 1996 remaster with 4 bonus tracks(the fusion-like B-side \\"La Raza Del Sol\\" and the \\"Live In Houston\\" takes of the aftermentioned Top 10 biggies,plus a cool booklet containing photos and tour dates from the \\"Escape\\" period.Essential!!

006441034X|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.   <br /> <br />I saw the film first and fell in love with it.  I then read the book and fell in love with it too.  The book has slight differences but I though both were as good as each other. <br /> <br />Howl is an fantastic character, he has so many (as donkey from Shrek would say) layers.  He is funny, charming, annoying, vain and many, many other things.  You can't help but love him, along with Calcifer. <br /> <br />The storyline is very cleaver, and different to anything I have ever read before.  Diana Wynne Jones must have an incredible imagination.  Even though the storyline is amazing, it is the characters I fell in love with first - always a sign of a good book. <br /> <br />This book is classified as child fiction, but I am a 29 year old female and can't rave about it enough. <br />Highly recommended! I am now going to read her other books.  <br />
0340818867|5.0|I have read a few books on the British lately filled with sweeping generalizations--many of their ideas are false or outdated or narrowed to one section of society. This is not one of them. It is written by an anthropologist who has taken great trouble and pains to find out the reasons behind the behavior of Brits. I would definitely recommend this book, but remember there are exceptions to the norm such as Richard Branson, Jamie Oliver, Michael Caine, any of the Beatles, J.K. Rowling. These are just some of the Great Brits who are creative, optimistic and entrepreneurial.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is one good Bond film. I must admit, that I, like so many others, did not believe that Daniel Craig would make a good James Bond. Oh, how wrong I was. Craig plays Bond with confidence and gives him exactly the rigth mixture of elegance and brutishness. We must keep in mind that Craigs Bond is new to the game, rough, tough, adventurous and most importantly, human. He is not yet the suave ladykiller we all know and love. He's still learning his trade. <br /> <br />I think the producers were very clever in distancing themselves from the smooth Bond from the past. We're not only dealing with a new Bond actor, but an entirely different kind of movies alltogether. The last few Bond films have been nothing more than flat (and really not funny) one liners and loads upon loads of gadgets. Too far fetched really. This new film is delightfully gadget-free and delivers clever dialogue, funny as well as impressive and dramatic moments and most importantly: it has a more realistic feeling to it than the latest of the Bond movies. You believe it could happen.  <br /> <br />This is partially acomplished by making the fightscenes very rough and tough (and beautifully choreographed) instead of the usual \\"judo chop\\". Also making Bond a proper soldier and a proper gentleman instead of the super suave super agent gives credibility. He is not afraid of getting dirty and leans on his physique rather than savvy when encontering problems. <br /> <br />Daniel Craig plays the role to perfection and the supporting cast also delivers beautiful performances, especially Dame Judy Dench as M is very good. This movie is spot on. <br />  <br />    Highest possible recommendation.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Having literally grown up together, 16-year-old Rory Gilmore and her 32-year-old mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.  <br /> <br />In Season 1, Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening. <br /> <br />Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.  <br /> <br />Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Kirk, a quirky \\"townie\\" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. <br /> <br />Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)

B000N6U0E2|5.0|It's not often a movie comes along and completely changes your perceptions. \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is just such a movie.I think Will gave the best performace of his career. He hasn't received this kind of accolades since Six Degrees of Seperation and Ali. In the past Will pretty much plays different versions of himself with exception of the two films I mentioned earlier. In Independence day, The Men In Black,Hitch and I Robot we all saw different versions of \\"Will Smith.\\" But in this film I didn't see \\"Will Smith.\\" I saw Chris Gardner,felt his pain and experienced his struggles through Will. I have been waiting for Will to show us his real acting abilities and he delivered it this time. I hope he concentrates on roles like this in the future. Congratulations Will, you deserve your Oscar nomination. I look forward to my struggles after seeing this movie.

B0006GAOCW|2.0|I give only two stars to this Fox's romantic comedy \\"First Daughter\\" not because of its unlucky resemblance with Mandy Moore's \\"Chasing Liberty\\" or the acting of Katie Holmes, which is not bad at all. She is sweet and cute even though the film completely misses its target audiences by including her embarrassing `table dancing' sequences. <br /> <br />No, I am disappointed by something else. \\"First Daughter\\" is pleasant, maybe too pleasant for me. I was thinking that the film is about the romantic life of Katie Holmes' character Samantha, only daughter of US President Mackenzie (Michael Keaton) running for the second term (reminding us of the real-life counterpart George W. Bush and his twin daughters). What happens if Samantha goes to college and falls in love with another student?  <br /> <br />Though some hints are given, the film wisely removes direct mention to the politics in real life. You don't know much about the president himself or his policies and party (except that he is very likable), but that kind of decision is understandable because the film is meant to be a romantic comedy that can be enjoyed by everyone.  <br /> <br />Still \\"First Daughter\\" does not have much romance in it. When the film should be romantic with Samantha's romance with the resident adviser Marc Blucas, it fails to be so, its romance interrupted by the unnecessary plot twist and the film's attitude after that point, which takes itself too seriously. The silly antics like water slide episode and Katie in blue bikini do not help, and neither does the subplot about Samantha's friendship with her roommate (played by Amerie). <br /> <br />The film is directed by Forest Whitaker who won Oscar for his terrific acting in \\"The Last King of Scotland.\\" I don't know what attracted him to this film, but I know his orthodox approach does not work here, ending up with rather tepid storytelling and bland characters. We need wit, satire, or at least biting kind of humor, and wilder romance and more imagination and fantasy. Katie Holmes is charming, but her getting drunk and doing table dance does not exactly make her so more.

B000A0GP0Y|2.0|It'd be hard enough to imagine a remake of the classic Longest Yard.  It'd be even harder to imagine a remake of the classic prison football film with Adam Sandler posing for Burt Reynolds.  Well, it became a reality, and just like you'd expect, the remake of the Longest Yard is a lame and needless remake of a classic.  Sandler plays disgraced NFLer Paul \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe, who finds himself in jail for quite some time.  The warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to assemble a team of prisoners to play his guards (led by William Fichtner) in a one-sided football game, which just so happens will be broadcast on ESPN.  Yeah, the Longest Yard is about as mainstream and product placement filled as anyone with operating brain cells can expect, and the supposedly funny and comic moments just come off as tiresome and, well, lame.  Yeah, that word has popped up a lot in this review, but I can't think of a more fitting word that suits this crud remake.  Not to mention the just plain unnecessary racist remarks to come from the guards in attempting to goad the running back (Nelly) into a fight.  The only thing that saves this crummy remake is Reynolds himself who shows up as the coach of Crewe's team, as well as a somewhat spirited performance from Chris Rock.  Not to mention that it's kind of fun to see many ex-NFLer's and greats like Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth as the guards, as well as pro wrestlers like Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash to boot.  Other than that though, saying that you're better off with the original Longest Yard is quite the understatement.

The transfer of this movie would need to be cleaned up digitally before it will be up to what Blu-ray can show.

B00000JNJ1|3.0|Before you take exception with the three stars I gave this one, please realize that I'm rating the single-disc compilation and not the music. In terms of the songs presented here, we're talking an easy five stars (even the sloppy tracks...that's what made this band great, a mixture of virtuosity and \\"How can they still be standing when they're that drunk?\\"). In terms of satisfying anyone other than the most casual or cash-strapped Faces fan, three stars is overly generous. The four-disc \\"Five Guys Walk Into A Bar...\\" box set is the way to go, not to mention owning each of the 4 Faces CDs and the Wood-era Stewart solo discs. Forget the \\"Great American Songbook\\" Rod Stewart you see in 2007. In the 70s, these guys were serious challengers to the throne occupied by the Rolling Stones in terms of songwriting and rocking attitude. That said, \\"Good Boys\\" DOES include one of the single greatest songs produced by the band, the late great Ronnie Lane's \\"Debris\\" (with powerful backing vocals from Stewart and some of Wood's most poignant playing). The hits are here (\\"Miss Judy's Farm,\\" \\"Stay With Me\\") as well as key album tracks like \\"Borstal Boys\\" (their last great, crunchy, stomping Chuck Berry-derived rocker) and the transcendent \\"Ooh La La.\\" It's just not enough...period. A good intro? Yeah, of course, like \\"The Beatles Ones\\" is a good intro to The Beatles. Listen to the BBC live tracks on \\"Five guys...\\" and you'll see what you're missing.
B00005KK4P|5.0|Karl Bohm's recordings of the Schubert Symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic were made in 1963 (Symphonies 8 and 9), 1966 (Symphonies 5 and 6), and 1972 (Symphonies 1,2,3, and 4) and still stand up well today.<br /><br />Bohm has a superb command of each symphony's architecture, and DG's recorded sound in all one could ask for: much better than Karajan's 1980s Berlin recordings for DG.<br /><br />I believe Bohm's Schubert recordings are better than the more recent DG's of Abbado/Chamber Orchestra of Europe, which strike me as rather light and chamber like by comparison.  Since I like big orchestra Schubert, I prefer Bohm.<br /><br />Karl Bohm lived 1894-1981, and began making recordings with the Dresden State Orchestra in 1934.  I highly recommend Bohm's Schubert cycle, and also his Mozart Symphonies (DG, also with the Berlin Philharmonic) and Beethoven Symphonies (DG, 1970-72, in three different Doubles releases, with the Vienna Philharmonic), essential to any collection of great music.

B000NA28IE|3.0|The kingdom of Alagaesia used to be ruled by dragon riders.  These warriors and their dragons brought peace and prosperity to the land for many years.  But one of them, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), wanted all the power for himself.  He betrayed and killed the others and became king of the land.  As is always the case in these tales, he rules with an iron fist and is hated by all.<br /><br />Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young man in the kingdom.  This seventeen year old is content to farm his uncle's land.  One day, while out hunting, he finds a weird stone.  He takes it home, and it hatches.  He now has a baby dragon on his hands.<br /><br />The dragon grows quickly, and Eragon learns that he is a dragon rider.  He is a fulfillment of prophecy and the last hope of the resistance to defeat Galbatorix.  He learns this from Brom (Jeremy Irons), a man from his village who tries to teach him a little about his new life while taking him to safety with the rebels.  Will they survive the perilous journey?<br /><br />First, what worked.  The acting was great.  The scenery was fantastic, and the special effects were awesome.  The dragon looked so real.  I'm seriously considering reading the books to see just what happens next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the actors and special effects teams were working with a very weak script.  Part of that is the basic stories fault.  Based on a book by the same name, the story feels like Star Wars with bits of other fantasy novels thrown in.  Of course, most of these \\"original\\" stories borrowed heavily from what came before them, so it's not like that in and of itself is a crime.<br /><br />The bigger problem is the length.  I feel like there is story missing from the movie.  Eragon learns magic overnight and we never see him bond with his dragon.  What I thought to be plot threads were introduced then lead nowhere.  I realize they were trying to keep the running time down since the movie is aimed at kids, but I think they could have found some other way to trim the time.<br /><br />Speaking of kids, they may or may not like the movie.  There is death, scary creatures, sorcery, and a rather intense battle at the end.  Parents will have to make this judgment call on their own.<br /><br />Any movie that makes me want to read the book can't be all bad.

B000M341QE|3.0|This is a good watchable movie, but it ain't no best movie of the year.  Many of the performaces were a bit forced, flat, or otherwise sub-par.  The only standouts were Alec Baldwin and a surprisingly solid Mark Walberg.  The romantic angles of the movie felt uniformly \\"hollywood\\", that is, lacking in any real substance or chemistry, or \\"reality\\".  I was taken out of the movie everytime Leo or Matt interacted with the female love interest. <br />This ranks right up there with \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Crash\\", and \\"Forrest Gump\\" for the Academy's tendency to pick contrived scenery-chewing over real substance and depth.

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I'm not a \\"hardcore\\" fan of Incubus, but I enjoy their music.  I have their Make Yourself and Morning View CDs and loved them.  I didn't get A Crow Left of Murder, however.   <br /> <br />Anyways, Light Grenades mixes in a little bit of all their stylistic leanings.  Some tracks, like Dig or Love Hurts, are a bit more pop, others like Pendulous Threads seem more alternative/funk like their earlier stuff.  Other stuff is more conventional hard rock like Anna Molly or Rogues.  It's kinda hard to classify Incubus's music, but why bother? It's good music.  This is a good CD and I recommend it.
B0002XMF5I|4.0|When Dio first left Black Sabbath after \\"Live Evil\\" was released, Black Sabbath faced a dillemna. The Eighties were moving on, and Ozzy had moved on to solo success. So what do they do? Invite another pioneering Heavy Metal singer along for the ride, Ian Gillan.<br /><br />The results were terrifying, in more ways than one. The album resulting from the collaboration, Born Again, should've been a masterpiece because its not only not under the dictatorial thumb of Ronnie James Dio (nothing against him, I love Dio and Dio Sabbath and Rainbow), but some of the flatted fifth Doom riffs we all know and love and also D tuning the guitars have returnd!<br /><br />So what results is a would be classic. Killer songs and screams, great atmosphere. What went wrong? Well ever listen to Ulver's Nattens Madrigal? Remember it sounded like there was no bass to the mix and that it was recorded on some cheap tape recorder in the other room? Well even though Ulver wanted it that way, its Black Sabbath we're talking about here and its unfair to have such a horrible production and mix.<br /><br />The riffs on here were good enough to not only have Spinal Tap and Danzig be inspired by them (Zero the Hero in paticular was remade basically into Danzig's Her Black Wings with the Moog Taurus pedal parts translated into piano notes!) but the singing rivals Gillan's time with Deep Purple. Bass? What Bass? I can hardly hear it, and when I do it sounds terrible, especially when compared to the great bass tone on Mob Rules (not that the playings bad here, but the tone? Terrible). Drums are as good as expected in that annoying Phil Collins gated reverb flat sounding way (Bill Wards performance is great though). So imagine an album where every frequency is gone except Treble, and that's what Born Again sounds like. Otherwise its great. I wish they would remix this the way it should be, because its probably their last classic album before the reformation.

Played perfectly straight, 'The Zombie Survival Guide' is a quick read with just the right tone so that you catch yourself actually planning for the coming zombie holocaust. The horror elements are good but inserted with a light touch. The result is just enough scare to make you forget there there is no such thing as a zombie. The next step is just enough encouragement to \\"plan ahead\\" that you actually start to plan! <br /> <br />  I burst out laughing when I realized I was actually contemplating how secure my home would be with the stairs chopped away, and where I could store food and water to endure an extended siege - by the walking dead!

B00005O3VC|5.0|Ah yes, Monty Python and the Holy Grail: One of the funniest movies EVER made. Who could forget the coconuts replaced for a horse, or the famous lines like \\"Its' just a flesh wound\\" and \\"We are the nights who say 'ni'!\\"? It may have been low budget, but if you think about it, those are usually the best kinds of movies around.<br /><br />The movie is layden with completely random parts, but you can tell the characters in the movie know it's random so it works for the film. The arguments over the swallows carrying coconuts, the black night scene, the scene where you \\"Bring out ya dead!\\", the nights who say \\"ni\\", and the very, VERY random scene with the animated sun and clouds yelling \\"Stand up! Stand up!\\" This is all pretty confusing at first, but that's the genius of Monty Python. And these sorts of scenes seem to fit in no matter how bizzare they are. And you just gotta love the beginning with the subtitles continuously being messed up, with some guy typing about his sister getting bitten by a moose. The ending is probably my only complaint, as it's so abrupt and kinda leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />This version comes with some great bonus features: The commercial that inspired the coconuts idea, the sites for the castle shots, and some random ones as well. One of my favorites would have to be on the first disc, where you click on the bonus features and someone says, \\"Please insert the second disc.\\" Then 5 seconds later you hear, \\"No, into the DVD player,\\" and you hear someone zipping his pants up!<br /><br />Probably the biggest treat on the DVD is the Kamelot scene done entirely with legos - very cool feature. It would have been even better if they included the WHOLE movie in lego form, but oh well....<br /><br />The movie is 5 stars all the way, but I do have on complaint.

The songs take a bit of time to reveal themselves, and then the true joy begins. <br /> <br />Too early to tell if I'm going to dig this as much as \\"FUNERAL\\" (a tall order, as I absolutely adore \\"FUNERAL\\"!), but so far all signs are quite positive indeed. <br /> <br />NOTE - I purchased the \\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" of this album, which will set you back a few extra bones.  It's little more than a nicer package and 2 flip-books. The oversized cardboard box is nice but cumbersome; the lenticular \\"neon bible\\" image on the front is pretty class, but care has to be taken else it will be marked.  The flip-books are cute but essentially worthless.  There are no extra tracks of any sort, and I presume the booklet is the same as in the standard version. <br /> <br />So really, it may not be worth it unless you like bulkier packaging. <br />But the album itself is VERY MUCH worth your time.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Man, how this guy grows on you...I thought his thump-thump-bleep-ping sing/talk was a gimmick, but it's borderline brilliant...! These layered hooky songs are fun, sassy, and funky. Smart, too. \\"North American Scum\\" is great, as is the intro \\"Get Innocuous\\". Grab your earphones and sing-a-long, who cares if you're in the office or at the gym? LCD, uh, says you can...!

B000005Z0E|5.0|Tupac Amaru Shakur's definitive album was released in 1991.  Beginning as a roadie and backup dancer for Digital Underground, this album was released right on time...almost immediately after Tupac became a \\"role model\\" for today's youth as Bishop in the movie Juice.  This album is a perfect picture and description of America's most infamous Young Black Male with song after song of lyrical poetry of heartache and pain.  Personally, Tupac created his own sub-genre in hip hop....even though there were \\"political\\" figures in hip hop such as X-Clan and Public Enemy.  Tupac may have quite possibly revolutionized and simplified the politics of America for the youth to relate to(even though he never intended to be an icon)...his message came across more razor sharp than any of his predecessors.  Most of the production by Digital Underground's Shock G and backed by a lyrical arsenal that couldnt possibly be matched makes this \\"required reading\\" for anyone looking to aspire as a hip hop artist.

B00008IHN1|5.0|On every possible level, this movie is quality all the way.  Acting, direction, script and music all add up to a highly enjoyable experience that leaves one exhilarated by the music, touched deeply by the story line, and entertained by the humourous events that unfold as Devon Miles leaves the inner city for a classy southern college on a marching band scholarship.  A street wise teenager, he's in for a few surprises in his new environment.  He has a lot of growing up and a lot of learning to do.  At the same time, however, it turns out that his teachers have something to learn from him.         Character development is one of the most outstanding features of this film.  Every single character, however auxiliary to the plot, is developed fully and colorfully.  Five minutes into the film we already have a deep insight into Devon's character and his charismatic personality.    Don't miss this film.  It's delightful.  It's powerful.  It's just plain GREAT.

B000I0QLZU|2.0|this is my 10th blu-ray movie, and it is one of the worst one I have seen, there is grain everywhere and colors are so saturated it made the picture look flat and plain.  Definitely not for showing off your HD equipment.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites, for many different reasons. First of all, Michael Bublé has some voice! It's just perfect. He makes it work so well with every one of the songs he sings. Also, every song is so calm and easy to listen to! I can just press play and not have to hit skip once. I love them all! Of course, some of them are more appealing to me than others, but I don't actually dislike any of them. They have this sort of jazzy feel to them, but not like full on jazz. A lot of them sound like they could be from old musicals. Aaaah I love every song on this album!!!! (Which is saying a lot for me) <br />My favorite songs: \\"Home\\", \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\", and \\"Song For You\\". I also especially like \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\", \\"You Don't Know Me\\", \\"You And I\\" and \\"Feeling Good\\". <br />Even if you don't buy this album, you should at least find a way to listen to it. It is amazing!
0553381695|4.0|The second part of A Song of Ice and Fire is a little better than the first book, but it follows in the same vein. Martin loves describing anything to great lengths, except battles. He can take half a paragraph describing the food on the table, and he goes at great lengths to describe a characters thoughts/feelings over a characters action. So, what we get is strong storytelling, everything isn't black or white, everybody for the most part has shades of grey, and Martin describes the turmoil within the characters. One thing of note Martin did a horrible job of describing battles in the first book, and he starts the same way in this book. Meaning he doesn't describe the battles, you hear about the battles, but the reader never takes part, so your imagination can come up with anything, because nothing is set in stone, because Martin never gave you the details. The most important battle of the book Martin does describe, and guess what? He does a great job, it's the most exciting part of the book. But as usual, he takes the reader out of mid-battle, and you hear the rest second hand. This is the one instance of a battle scene, where I agree with Martin, because he leaves the reader not quite believing the outcome. And the reader can assume anything because Martin did not describe the end of the battle, so one can assume anything can happen in the future books.    Martin is a strong believer that length equates into epic, which is wrong, Michael Moorcock used to write epic Elric novels that came in at 200 pages. And the problem with this is, in first 275 pages all chapters start with a character seeing a comet, and Martin describes his or her interpretation of what this comet means to them. It was very tedious to the point I was saying \\"please don't start this chapter with another comet reference\\". But after 275 pages of character development, we get into the meat of the story, and it is meaty. I really enjoyed the last 500+ pages of the book. It was exciting, mature fantasy, and kept me turning the pages. So, I ending up enjoying this novel quite a bit. But, for the amount of content that we the reader receive, this book should have come in at 500-600 pages, rather than the almost 900 it came in at. An editor is needed, and the reader has to suffer the unnecessary chapters, but I will admit wading through the bad will produce a positive result, because this was a good book.    So I found some flaws this this book, but the good outweighed the bad, and the result was a very good book. Better than the first in the series, imo.    one last thing of note, whereas we didn't hear much of magic in the first book, we start to see a lot more of it in this book. So it is starting to take a turn away from typical Medieval Fantasy, and starting to turn into wondrous fantasy.
B000NA28I4|4.0|[If I express opinions with which you do not agree, I'm open to debate.  This is, after all, a review--an expressed opinion.]<br /><br />************************************<br /><br />Will your kids love this flick? Yes.<br /><br />Will you enjoy it? Probably.<br /><br />************************************<br /><br />The kids will love the story, and it will hold their attention.  Yes, there is fantasy violence, but it is not treated with the same level of gore as was present in the Lord of the Rings films (or most other modern fantasy.  This kids loved it and have asked to watch it again, but I did notice that it did not spill over into their play as some other movies have (i.e., no one has been running around the house pretending to be Aragon).<br /><br />The main character was refreshing--his rash decisions, his wrestling with his 'brother'.  I believe the author's youth brought a realistic perspective to Eragon that is often missed by other writers who are trying to recreate their understanding of youth.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good film that your family will enjoy watching.<br /><br />+++++++++++<br /><br />If you only want to read good things about this film, stop here.  I'm not out to bash Christopher Paolini--the fact that he wrote it while so young is quite impressive, and I hope to see more from him as his writing style matures--but I do want to reflect upon those things that made this movie (and not necessarily the book) something less that great.<br /><br />+++++++++++<br /><br />I've seen many mentions (in press and in reviews) that cite the influence of the Lord of the Rings on this book and movie.  As a long-time fantasy reader and fan, I don't see the connection apart from the obvious generic parallels: fantasy genre, dragon, reluctant hero, experienced mentor, enemy wants to kill the hero.<br /><br />I found the story line a little too predictable at times, the villians too cliche (with one exception), and the costuming too bazaar (my word choice is intentionally not \\"bizarre\\").  Perhaps the written work provided the background required to make sense of the costuming--especially Arya at the end (the native American homage) and the Varden.  While I could see a clear middle-east theme in the peoples of the Varden, it did not make sense with my knowledge of mountain cultures.  Perhaps the world of Eragon does not see snow in its mountains, but that one cultural juxtaposition just did not fit and it affected how I saw the movie as a whole.<br /><br />As to the villians, I found Galbatorix to be unbelievable.  This individual who was the cause of the downfall of the dragon riders is shown as little more than an inept monarch who likes making threats.  His unveiled \\"secret\\" at the end was something I anticipated from the first few scenes.  The Ra'zac were intriguing to me--I would have like to have seen more of them rather than the (seemingly) dim-witted Urgals.  When I saw the Urgals, I thought immediately of the Gumbas from the Mario Brothers movie.  My son said that the book painted them as horrible warring monsters, but the movie made them look like stupid warring oafs.  Now, the one villian who was interesting was Durza.  I found his portrayal very compelling (even though his appearance is apparently nothing like it was described in the book), his actions befitting his role, and his presence necessary to carry the film.<br /><br />The presence of the older, experienced but reluctant mentor is, pehaps, an overused plot device in many fantasy yarns.  In this case, although Brom's backstory was very predictable, how his role played out in the story (or rather the \\"when\\" more than the \\"how\\") was not expected.  The Brom character was believable.  I'd love to see Paolini write Brom's backstory sometime.<br /><br />On a final note--admittedly and entirely a matter of preference--I did not like the portrayal of Saphira the dragon.  At times, the dragon's physical traits appeared feline, or even cartoonish--mostly around the head/face.  Overall, the dragon CGI was fantastic and the movement and textures were good (especially the distant shots), but Saphira (again, in my opinion) lacked something truly \\"draconian.\\"  I cannot full place it, but I think it is, in part, to the construction of the wings.  I was weaned on dragons that had leathery, bat-like wings, so my prefernces are likely biased by those early stories.  I will read the book soon to see if those film wings match the author's descriptions.nish--mostly around the head/face.

I hope they make the second book into a movie so I can see the story continue on. I think critics are not always right and I have watched multiple movies that were excelent and reveiws sucked for it. All in all I thought it was a great movie and everyone I know that has watched, liked it alot.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Well, once again - its hard to get past Jack Nicholson's age.  I love the actor in some movies but he's not a romantic actor.  The character is supposed to be 60....Nicholson is really 70 but looks 75.  He's a loveable crusty old fart but who would want to kiss him!  I never saw the \\"charm\\" in this character.  What made him magnetic to any of the women? <br />  <br />Diane Keaton is radiant, as usual, and her character is believeable.  I loved the crying scenes! <br /> <br />In any case, I would classify this as a cute movie.  Not a must see.
B000003C5C|5.0|For this merely being Death's second album, it is amazing the extent of maturity they have gone through from Scream Bloody Gore. Of course, Death is still presenting us with a tasty plate of raw, crushing brilliance that was trademarked by their first album, but the songs are beginning to sound more structured. Chuck's vocals are much, much better (at least to me) than from Scream Bloody Gore and the overall sound quality seems to be at an equilibrium between polished and raw. It is still, by all standards, fairly typical old-school death metal, but it is above par in comparison to many of the bands of that day and age. Brutal, fast, and top to bottom quality DM. <br /> <br />Song Favorites: \\"Born Dead,\\" \\"Left to Die,\\" \\"Pull the Plug,\\" and \\"Open Casket.\\" (Open Casket is my all time fav)

B000LPS3B2|4.0|I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series).<br /><br />The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. \\"Shutter\\" refers to his camera and what it represents. \\"Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones..\\" I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore.<br /><br />The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid.<br /><br />Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the \\"shock ending\\" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place.<br /><br />Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general.

B00026WU64|5.0|Dylan was relatively unknown before the release of this album, but he certainly wasn't afterwards.  Simply tremendous from cover to cover.  Blowin' in the Wind is obviously a theme song for an entire generation, but the most important song on the album is the stunning 'A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall'.  Not only did it almost eerily predict the future turmoil in the latter part of the '60s, it is also one of the great poems of the 20th century.  When Allan Ginsberg, himself no slouch as a poet, heard this song, it brought him to tears.  The Beatles listened to this album endlessly and worshipped Dylan.  If it's good enough for the fab 4, it should be good enough for you!  Dylan, with just his rudimentary guitar strums, basic harmonica lines and untrained voice was somehow able to create totally unique, incredible, moving music that hundreds of would-be Dylans were not able to come close to duplicating.  Truly one of the great albums from a singular genius.  If you haven't figured it out yet, I'd recommend this album.

0790729350|4.0|Harmless nostalgia. Those should be the first words that anyone old enough to have been able to be there or who was actually there should shout after seeing this updated version of the Woodstock Festival of 1969. The second thought should be- did we really dress (or undress), act and talk that way? It is almost like coming out of a time machine. I do not think that today's youth with their worries about getting into good colleges, making money and being members in good standing on the information `superhighway' would get the point of many of the interviews with the young of my generation, the generation of `68.     Enough said on that, though. The real point of the film and the reason for taking the time to watch it is the music. (It is the music, man!) At one time many of us thought that music and the counter culture that would evolve from it was the revolution. Well, life itself proved the folly of that idea, however, some of the music presented here still is worth listening to. Some of it, however, also sounds and feels very dated like we used to think about the music of the early 1950's. There are several highlights here. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, obviously. The Jefferson Airplane and Carlos Santana, surprisingly. And, if one performance defined the whole festival and what music was all about in the summer of 1969 in the lives of those who were young `hippies' or `politicos' then it is Jimi Hendricks. If man and musical instrument ever acted in total unison it was in this performance.  Watch it.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|Although the director is a major talent and a truly nice person, SHORTBUS is almost impossible to contemplate without a remote control. . .  WITH YOUR FINGER ON THE FAST FORWARD BUTTON. The often attractive actors become remarkably banal once they open their mouths. This is like an early Greg Araki film but with sex scenes replacing the rebellious wit. All the funny lines, in fact, can be found in the trailer. As for the sexual carryings-on, unless you have never watched a pornographic film before, you'll wonder what the big deal is about.Then there's the actor portraying former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, you'll wish he remained in the closet along with Ed. SHORTBUS, in the end, is truly all over the place, and when you watch the deleted scenes, you'll realize the reason why: no one was really in control. What in the world is that dialogue with the nosy neighbor talking to the President on his cell phone? Improvisation in film is truly hard to carry off. Christopher Guest frequently gets it right. Cameron, however, apparently requires a strong screenplay to carry forth his highly applaudable notions of total sexual liberation with any depth.  In the end, Shortbus is a flaccid ride to nowhere.

B00005JPLU|3.0|\\"300\\" is a fantastical, romanticised look at Spartan King Leonidas' defence of his lands and liberties against the onslaught of invading Persian forces, led by Xerxes. <br /> <br />And that, frankly, is just about all the plot you'll need before watching the movie. <br /> <br />\\"300\\" may well have been based on actual historical events, but it certainly isn't about historical accuracy. Not that it much matters once the film gets going: anyone levelling that particular criticism at this movie may well find that they protesteth too much, I doubt the actual history of the tale was this entertaining. <br /> <br />The real stars of \\"300\\" are James D. Bissel (Production Design), Michael Wilkinson (Costumes) and Zack Snyder (Director). This is a really, really beautiful movie to watch, and as a piece of cinema, is infinitely more rewarding than \\"Sin City\\". It's more creative, more lush, and far more confident in its execution. The initial scenes start slowly, verging on boring - the CGI giant wolf looks like it belongs in an early Harry Potter flick - but once the battle scenes at Thermopylae begin in earnest, the incredible skill of Director Snyder at showcasing the beauty and artistry of Bissel's and Wilkinson's work kicks in, and \\"300\\" works best during these sumptuous, grisly battle sequences. <br /> <br />There's a richness of texture and variety in during the battle sequences that is really unusual to see: filmed in a very monochromatic manner, it's an incredibly clever use of colour (much better, and far more subtle than in \\"Sin City\\") and light that keeps our eyes focused and our imagination caught. Also, the Harry Potterishness of the Wolf notwithstanding, the special effects are really excellent, and set a whole new standard with what can be accomplished outside of the totally computer-generated world. Artistically, \\"300\\" is top-drawer, all the way. <br /> <br />On occasion, though, the lushness overextends itself, and certain scenes slip into mawkishness: Xerxes' Porta-throne ensemble sort of looks like something one would find onstage at a Cher concert, and the Ephors at the beginning of the movie are way too overstated in their makeup and direction. Similarly, the Oracle looks cheap and overdone - had these scenes been pared-back, they'd have found more success as devices with which to forward the plot - but as is, they simply pale in comparison to the frankly more interesting battle sequences. <br /> <br />Which brings me neatly to the acting - there's not a whole lot going on. Once Leonidas and his men begin to fight, there's no more need for dialogue or interaction, so why writer Kurt Johnstadt chose to cut the action sequences with some (by comparison) very boring scenes involving Queen Gorgo and the Spartan council is beyond me. It's a cheap way of giving the audience a break from the battle sequences, but sadly, the break proves to be more tiresome than restful, and we're dying for these scenes of human interest to finish. There's not much of a chance for characterisation, either - it would appear that a lot of shouting and some tired one-liners pass for an indication of masculinity and brotherhood in \\"300\\" - but again, this forces the real reason for watching the picture - the fighting - into the background. <br /> <br />I wouldn't have minded half as much if the script had been of a higher standard, but it's just not. ALSO, THERE IS A LOT OF SHOUTING! PERHAPS ANCIENT SPARTANS WERE VERY HARD OF HEARING, I DO NOT KNOW. Don't misunderstand - nobody here gives a bad performance, per se, there's just not enough onscreen non-battle time with which to create a character in \\"300\\", so the talents of Gerard Butler, Lena Heady and Rodrigo Santoro are left unexercised. <br /> <br />I can't recommend \\"300\\" as a really great movie - it's a one-trick pony, and whenever it's excellent (the battle scenes), it shoots itself in the foot with some poor scripting and boring domestic and political sub-plots. Still, if you're a fan ofaction, you'll have a ball - I certainly did during those bits.

That was truly the Greatest Generation - we owe this generation of Americans much!
B000002P5W|5.0|Do you still think any other musicians improved Jimi Hendrix's guitar feeling and technique??. Maybe you can name a few owning excellent skills and probably unforgettable trademark effects in their playing. But JIMI's music is not only fireworks. I strongly recommend you to listen to this remastered album, which by the way. was recorded IN THE LATE SIXTIES!!!. Then you realize why he is still the best rock guitarrist...and composer and singer and performer, but above all guitar hero. Hey!, please do not forget that unfortunately JIMI HENDRIX only recorded three official albums \\"Electric Layland\\", \\"Are You Experienced?\\" and this \\"Axis:Bold As Love\\". The rest of his discography are good profitable businesses for the heirs of its excellent legacy (of course with some exceptions in form of a pair of testimonial live recordings). Also, the best point on this re-issue is the respect (and improvement) on all the original texts and graphics from the original albums. Needless to say that the audio remastering is a plus.
0374105235|5.0|This is one of the most powerful and compelling books I have read in a long time.  The personal experiences of the author defy the imagination of one who has lived a very different life.  This story opened my eyes to the vast gulf between the context of my life and of those around me in contrast to the lives led by those growing up in the seemingly uncivilized parts of Africa and possibly of other continents.  I would recommend this as valuable reading for anyone from high school onward.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version is amazing!! They really stuck to the book, finally! All of the characters were developed properly so that the viewer understands who is who and their relationship with each other. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is finally shown in emotional and physical depth!! While watching this film I was very impressed. I am studying to become a costume designer for period films like this and I can honestly say that the costumes were perfect! I was very pleased to see that.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is an excellent album. Neil is performing a lot of these songs for the first time and you can here the good reception the audience gives him. \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" is particularly good. I've always liked the way Neil Young speaks to the audience. If you're a fan you'll like this, his voice is so pure and he hits every note. If you're new to Neil then this is a good introduction. Plus you get a few songs from Time Fades Away that aren't available on CD. That's nice. \\"Journey Through The Past\\" and \\"Love In Mind\\" are just exceptional.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I learned from reading these reviews that this is from a book series, so let me first issue this warning.  If anyone ever does this to the long 600-800 page/book Wheel of Time series, there will be consequences. <br /> <br />Okay that being said, this is about a dragon.  At least 9 out of 10 Dragon movies are bad, usually really bad.  I can only think of one good one, \\"Dragonslayer\\" or two if you want to count the animated Hobbit movie.  I knew it was going to be bad, but my brother was interested in seeing it.  I was surprised at how bad it was though.  Fortunately we were able to view it as a comedy. <br /> <br />This movie lays down some more evidence that special effects alone don't make a good movie.  It would have really helped if the director would have written out the plot or even story boarded the movie before filming, because travel time and sequencing of events is absolutely horrible.  From the creatures and scenes it's obvious that the director saw LOTR, but he managed not to pickup travel times when on foot or horse.  I mean Frodo and Sam were walking to one destination through all 3 movies.  There's a clue!  Another reviewer already mentioned that the \\"magic\\" Dragon jumps from 50lbs to 5000lbs in one ridiculous moment.  But they didn't mention: <br />(1) Eragon overhears one of the \\"Orcs\\" torturing information out of the shop owner about him having the blue egg and that he lives on a farm.  He races away and is FLOWN to his farm where he finds his uncle dead.  Not only did the \\"Orcs\\" find his farm, beat him there on foot, killed his uncle after toruring him but they cleared out all before Eragon managed to get there.  Brom then immediately shows up right after on horse back with a spare horse and all of his gear. <br />(2) During the whole movie the \\"Orcs\\" instantly report back to the shade at home base and then instantly go back out to wherever Eragon is. <br />(3) After traveling for days to the edge of the kingdom, Eragon gets tricked into flying back to save the girl (reviewers are naming an elf) who stole the blue egg.  Brom who is restricted to horses, manages to show up just in time to save Eragon. <br />(4) After Eragon goes through the water fall beyond the edge of the kingdom, the \\"Orcs\\" managed to report back to shade hame base and get back to the water fall in force in about a hour.  It takes about two hours for the kings army to get there.  We assumed that they spent the extra hour getting assembled, organized and up the mountain to get behind Eragon's new friends.  We were waiting for siege engines to role in too, but we didn't see any.  I was laughing kind of hard, so I may have missed them. <br />(5) Eragon learns how to use magic in a foreign language, fight, and fly in a couple of days. <br />(6) From Egg to End, maybe a week or two of time passes. <br /> <br />Other things that are wrong with the movie (not a complete list): <br />(1) There's a dragon in it <br />(2) John Malkovich is barely in the movie, but then again it was hard not laugh at his lines.  Do they expect him to show up for a sequel?  Hungray can't be that exciting.  More green screening perhaps? <br />(3) The blue egg looks like it could have been cave troll Viagra. <br />(4) There is absolutely no liquid in the egg, but hey it's a \\"magic\\" egg. <br />(5) What was the point of his brother being there and then leaving?  I had the impression that he left to join up with those who had left the kingdom, but later it's completely clear that Eragon has no idea about the people who oppose the King.  Is he going to show up in a future worse movie? <br />(6) No one noticed a BLUE baby dragon.  Not even his uncle?  I guess that's because his farm was so far away from the village. <br />(7) All of the clothing is neatly cut and stitched, including Eragon the farm boy. <br />(8) I have closets harder to escape from than the cage that untrusted dragon rider's son was put in. <br />(9) As soon as the \\"Orcs\\" attack, the resistance fighters immediately retreat.  I guess preparing for war is much different than fighting a war. <br />(10) Eragon's useless armor fits him, even though they all say that they expected someone bigger.  I'm not sure from all of the laughing, but I think they said that they made the Dragon armor in the hour or two before the big battle. <br />(11) Magic seems arbitrary, shade seems all powerful compared to anyone else. <br />(12) Some reviewers mentioned dwarves and elves.  I didn't see any. <br /> <br />I should have just listed what is good in the film.  There's some really nice scenery shots (may or may not be real), the shade seems like a good character, Sienna Guillory has a certain appeal.
1400082773|4.0|Barack Obama, in search of himself, has placed himself under the microscope not by us (tho we'd like to think that) but HIMSELF.  In an attempt to find a meaning to the legacy his father left for him, he can only establish the first movements of etching his steps in the sands of time. What we conclude in this inspiring movement, is not confusion, or the search of a father, but well organized thoughts of expression that places the emphesis on the road that is less often traveled. Rarely do one reveal where they came from - with a glimps of where they are going. I can't seem to understand how others have become so critical in reviewing the lost moments in anothers life. By choice or design, I think Barack will some day find out who he really is, with all the world watching. I can only hope that what he really finds is a man of substance. \\"Dreams from My Father\\" very powerful yet sad.
B0000700KL|5.0|After seeing BARAKA on a wide screen in 1996, I felt like I had been viewing the world with blinders on and all of a sudden they were blown right off. This visual documentary filmed in 49 countries is a MUST SEE for anyone who appreciates the aesthetic world and evocotive music. Being an artist, this ROCKED MY WORLD and opened up endless possibilities for me as an independent filmmaker. It also forced me to sit with deep inquiry and catapulted me into exploring other parts of the world. I share it with everyone I know! Ron Fricke is a genious!
B000A3VTT8|3.0|This is a beautifully staged production with masterful singing. However, if you have not seen the original, uncropped version of this production I urge you to find a copy of the 1981 VHS filming of this masterpiece. It will enhance your appreciation for the incredible staging, because the DVD is cropped a bit tighter than the video.     Part of the beauty of this production is feeling that you part of the audience. However, there are numerous tight shots that allow you to fully appreciate the expressions on the faces, almost as if you are looking through opera glasses.     The director has a lot of fun with his performers, and sets up visual humor that is very entertaining. The singing, acting, and interaction of the characters is unsurpassed, in my opinion, but the loss of the margins of the staging causes me to give 3 stars, not 5 to the DVD. (Maybe I'm just partial to my old VHS version!)
B000FSME1A|3.0|Basically, one point here. When a film exceeds 200 minutes in length, a single 7.9 gigabyte disc is too little space for it. While I agree that branching was a good idea implemented poorly, and not just in this case, watching the single-disc Apocalypse Now Redux on a metre-sized plasma TV will have you weeping for a two-disc set. Trust me on this.
B00005JNQS|4.0|A mediocre plot is saved by the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Robin Williams. Jennifer Coolidge's voicing of Aunt Fanny was positively the most perfect casting imaginable! Greg Kinnear did a great job as Ratchet, but the character of Ratchet was more annoying than intimidating. As kids movies go I suppose this one was okay. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars but since I can't, I'll round up.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Robin Williams is amazing in this role. We just don't realize his talent as an actor. I just loved the movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|With a genius that only a Disney/Pixar partnership can create, Cars comes off as one of the most entertaining movies of the last several years. With characters like Lightning McQueen, Tow Mater, Doc Hudson and the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Larry The Cable Guy and Paul Newman just to name a few, this movie delivers time and again! There are lessons/morals that can teach kids about priorities and what not, but there are enough laughs for both little kids and big kids alike!<br /><br />Radiator Springs is brilliantly-colored and the inhabitants come to life in this cinematic event. I loved it!
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This movie was best never made in my opinion. There was really no point to it and it really just came off as cheesy and unbelievable.  <br /> <br />I mean Rocky is older, and although his character comes still quite strong as in any of the other films, everyone around him are just weak and lacking characters. Steps, his son, Paulie even are just standing around with frowns and a frozen stare for most of the film while Rocky still goes on and on about the world being lousy and you have to take your hits and get back up- you know all the same stuff he went on about in the other films before. And now it is just old to hear about. <br /> <br />Along with the lack of any real characters to care about besides Rocky, the story itself is just a little too unbelievable in my opinion. He being able to last in the ring with that young and uninteresting boxer I found a little silly and it wasn't played out in any way exciting.  <br /> <br />The story is boring, the characters are worse- the only thing that helps this movie go to just 'okay' status is Rocky himself. After loving the character for so long through Rocky 1-4 (5 was pretty iffy too for me) you want to see how he turns out regardless. But besides the loveable Rocky character, nothing else is worthwhile to watch. So I say stick with Rocky 1-4, even 5 for it did have its moments, but it's not worth the time to watch this one. I just felt this last movie wasn't worth the time or money making it. <br /> <br />3/5
B0006VIE4C|5.0|It has been a long time since I've seen the original Star Wars theatrical releases. The way they were ORIGINALLY. I loved it. For me, it's like watching a good Charlie Chaplin movie. You don't focus on the lack of special effects, sound or what they don't have. You let your imagination run wild and simply go along for the ride.<br /><br />As Luke Skywalker begins his journey to self-discovery, I find myself walking it with him, unobstructed by 21st century special effects and additions that look grossly out of place in the updated version. The updated version has its place, but I much prefer the classic 1977 release.<br /><br />There's something to be said for the way things were... \\"a long long time ago, in a movie theater not so far away...\\"
B000002J0N|3.0|Some review the sound quality of an album. Of far more importance to me is the time and culture it conjures.  For me, I was sailing again in the intricacies of their harmony and poetry, young and free, again. Pure rush!
0385335997|5.0|Each book in the Outlander series seems to be more exciting than the previous book - Voyager rates in the \\"couldn't put it down\\" category from me and the members of our book club. If you haven't read any books in the series, start at the beginning with Outlander and I promise by the time you reach this 3rd book, you will no doubt be a \\"Fraser\\" fanatic.  I was a reluctant reader when we decided as a club to read Outlander - sheer size of the novel was daunting, but GO FOR IT.  Each word is necessary to the storytelling and you won't even notice the how many pages go by and POOF, you are done and in a panic to get the next book.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|Still, any self-respecting Clash fan should own a copy of London Calling, even if the debut is better. Actually, a better part of the songs on London Calling are excellent, but there are four or five that don't do much for me.<br /><br />There's plenty of variety on this album, and in fact most of the genre experiments work perfectly. We'll get there later. First, for the group's signature slash-and-burn punk songs. They're all great. Clampdown is a total classic. Yes, you can understand what Joe Strummer's singing for a change. But the lyrics are great, so I don't mind. Spanish Bombs is arguably even better, with a famed Spanish-sung refrain. Hateful, Brand New Cadillac, 4 Horsemen and I'm Not Down are all old-school Clash, each could've easily come off of the first album.<br /><br />There's also touches of reggae on this album, another thing The Clash did well. For instance, the apocolyptic ticking-bomb title track may seem like it's another Clash rocker (albeit one of the best ever), but that's a reggae rhythm they set it to. The Guns of Brixton, Paul Simonon's lone Clash composition, is even better, my vote for The Clash's best songs. His dead-on vocals deliver the song's harsh message about police brutality perfectly. And even if it were just an instrumental, it would still be perfect, thanks to that great bassline in the intro and the reggae percussion. Rudie Can't Fail, straight-up ska, is one of their more fun songs.<br /><br />Now onto the more experimental material. The mellow Lost in the Supermarket probably has the best lyrics ever found on a Clash album, yeah it's set to a disco beat, but it ain't Stayin' Alive. Jimmy Jazz is... well, whatever the hell it is. Great song, impossible to pin down. There's also the country/pop classic Train in Vain (Stand By Me), which almost didn't make it onto the album since Joe Strummer reportedly hated it. NEVER trust an artist to review his own material. That song's proof right there.<br /><br />On the other hand are a couple lesser songs, Lover's Rock, Revolution Rock, The Right Profile, The Card Cheat and Koka Kola. Sorry, but none of these make any impact on me and should've been left off.<br /><br />Yes, I like London Calling. It's easily one of the best double-albums ever, and by far the last good Clash album - to me, Sandinista! and Combat Rock took the group off in the absolute wrong direction (though they yielded a few good songs each), and Cut the Crap is an insult to the Clash.<br /><br />Buy this if you like The Clash, since it's really worth having around, even if it may not be one of the ten greatest albums ever made.s, Lover's Rock, Revolution Rock, The Right Profile, The Card Cheat and Koka Kola.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Rocky Balboa steps into the ring one last time for an exhibition match against heavyweight champion Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon. A virtual dream match says that if Dixon and Balboa were to fight in their prime, Balboa would win. It gets people talking and surely enough, Rocky's ready to rumble in Las Vegas. For the first time in his professional career, he's fighting without Adrian at his side; we learn that she lost her own fight to the \\"woman cancer\\". Paulie, Duke, and Rocky Jr. (now renamed Robert) along with Little Marie are all back to help the Italian Stallion go the distance.<br /><br />I'm a huge Rocky fan; I grew up watching these movies over and over again (I saw 4 of them in theaters as they were coming out; Rocky III-IV-V and Rocky Balboa) and I couldn't wait to see this one when I first saw the trailer for it last fall. Kudos to Stallone for pulling this off and finishing the Rocky saga the way it was meant to end (Rocky V surprisingly is not as bad as we all remember it, but no less lightweight compared to the other entries in the series). The Stallion is in great shape and it shows. Stallone, who continues to write and direct the series, has injected a lot of emotion in this last ride; more so than the last two installments combined.<br /><br />Bringing back Little Marie from the first film was very appropriate and Geraldine Hughes did a great job portraying her. I like the way Rocky and Marie's relationship develops; she needs him to believe in herself and he needs her to help fill the void Adrian left. Milo Ventimiglia was perfectly cast as Robert (whatever happened to the name Rocky Jr.?) who's been living in the shadow of a legend. Burt Young played Paulie the same way he's always done and we love him for it. Everything that made the Rocky films what they are is here: the training montage, the run up the museum steps, the flashbacks, Bill Conti's Rocky fanfare, and that exciting final boxing match. The boxing sequences were expertly filmed and the use of black and white at times was a nice touch.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is for all of us kids of the 70's and 80's who grew up watching Rocky fight Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago and kept asking for more. It bathes in nostalgia and delivers the goods on every level. Stallone should be proud to have his beloved character go out in a blaze of glory like this. It's been a great saga, we'll miss you Rocky.use of black and white at times was a nice touch.  <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is for all of us kids of the 70's and 80's who grew up watching Rocky fight Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago and kept asking for more.

B000LAZDQA|4.0|And not all of them are angry!  All of them are explored, however, in very graphic detail.  Yes, in \\"Shortbus,\\" fiercely talented writer/director John Cameron Mitchell attempts to follow up his superb debut (\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\") with a film that looks deeper into the human condition, both emotionally and corporeally.<br /><br />The film opens with a whimsical camera shot, swingin' swooshin' and swoopin' through and around a beautiful pastel skyline model of New York, over the swaggerin' sounds of a walking bass line.  That we are looking at a (literally) colorful representation of New York here is important, as some of the events that follow - especially those at the Shortbus salon itself - are meant to, I think, evoke a colorful representation of an idyllic (but not necessarily 100 percent realistic) place where one can go to work through one's sexual and emotional issues without fear of scorn or reprisal.<br /><br />Some of the characters working on these issues include Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia, the sex therapist (oops, I mean \\"couples counselor\\") who can't negotiate the long and winding road that leads from her G spot to the big O (and no, I'm not talking about Gail and Oprah here).  Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy are James and Jamie, who take in Jay Brannan's Ceth as the new meat in their five year old monogamy sandwich.<br /><br />And along the way, there are enough strongly presented, well-performed and emotionally charged moments in this film to make it much more than \\"that mainstream film with all the graphic sex.\\"  Plus it has a terrific soundtrack (Jay Brannan's song \\"Soda Shop,\\" which repeats on the DVD main menu, is especially catchy).  That being said, I think \\"Shortbus\\" ultimately pulls up a little, um, short when compared to the brilliance of \\"Hedwig\\".  In a way, John Cameron Mitchell made a nearly impossible task for himself by making such an outstanding first film - how do you follow something as instantly iconic as Hedwig?<br /><br />In \\"Shortbus,\\" we get an envelope-pushing, genre-busting and daring film that truly is, I feel, the first film featuring graphic sex to have its other story elements resonate through and beyond the mere carnal titillation.  That in itself is no small achievement.  But, to me, \\"Shortbus\\" is no \\"Hedwig\\" in terms of overall cinematic inspiration.  And maybe it's not meant to be.  And maybe it's not fair to compare.  Smaller in scale and ambition, \\"Shortbus\\" still succeeds for the most part on its own merits.  I just wish the shadow of Hedwig hadn't loomed so large.<br /><br />I would ultimately give this film 3.5 stars, but because of the excellent DVD features as well as my respect for the sheer bravado required to pull off a project such as this, I'm rounding up to 4 stars for this particular product.hortbus,\\" we get an envelope-pushing, genre-busting and daring film that truly is, I feel, the first film featuring graphic sex to have its other story elements resonate through and beyond the mere carnal titillation.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|I have watched Rocky since it first came out and I just love the guy! I almost got to see it when it first came out around Christmas, but opted to Dreamgirls and prayed to be one of the first to buy it when they released it on DVD, and sure enough, I was one of the first, I watched it tonight and wasn't disappointed; Watching Rocky at Adrian's grave was real touching; Bringing back Little Marie(now grown and in need of a little help)was a nice touch; Seeing Rocky moving on with his restaurant(lvoingly named after Adrian) and seeing Paulie again(who never disappoints us no matter what with his wisecracks and asides); and you got a good ending to a great set of movies; I'm like the promoter who wanted Rocky in Rocky 5, Rocky truly fought some wars in the ring, and in this film, he shows us that he still got some of it left in him; Only this time, he goes toe to toe with the Boxing Commission, for refusing to let him box even though he passed the tests and physicals; To bringing his family in line for this event, and most of all, bringing himself to the ring and fighting this young fella; he doesn't disappoint us. Personally, I thought after Rocky 5, it was OVER. even bought the Boxed 5 set; but I was a bit happy to see Rock come back like a phoenix in Rocky Balboa. He'll always be a favorite and hero of mine.

B000AARKW6|4.0|(3.5/5 stars)  Carlito \\"Charlie\\" Brigante has just been released from prison on a technicality, after serving five years of a thirty-year sentence. He proclaims he has retired from the life of drug dealing and crime that landed him in prison, and he resolves to go straight. He wants only to save $75,000 so he can head to the Bahamas and buy into a car rental partnership. When he chances upon his ex-girlfriend, Gail (the beautiful Penelope Ann Miller), all indications are that his life will turn out superb after all. Carlito discovers, however, that escaping his former lifestyle proves nearly impossible as his past catches up with him. In the lead role, Al Pacino offers the perfect complexity that makes him believable as a reformed thug, whose experiences have wrought him the wisdom and paternal temperament he will need to survive. As in so many other films, we sympathize with his character here because he brings such a gentle demeanor to the role. Also outstanding is Sean Penn, who is terrific as Carlito's attorney and \\"brother,\\" among other roles. \\"The Ultimate Edition\\" features a widescreen presentation with DTS sound and deleted scenes. For about $10, you cannot go wrong. (And, if you are a fan of Penelope Ann Miller, you'll want this DVD to enjoy her nude scenes repeatedly)
B000AM1TGC|5.0|I bought this on import LP in 1975 and have been listening to it a couple of times a year for  32 years. I know this recording. At least I thought I did. The remastering of this music is steller. I am hearing things in this original mix that I have never heard before. I even compared this to the initial CD release and there is no comparison. The acoustic instruments have much more depth and presence. The electric soundstage is well balanced. For the first time, the bass and bass pedals can be heard in full depth and brilliance. There could be some serious foundation shaking with the right subwoofer. I always believed this LP could have fit comfortably between Foxtrot and Selling England if Genesis had recorded it. The only thing that keeps this work from being a true Genesis project is the absence of Peter Gabriel's vocals and flute playing. This recording IS that good. It has always been my favorite Hackett release. You need to add this to your collection.

0060935456|5.0|This is the first book I read by Richard Adams and I loved it. What a wonderful allegory of the human condition in the story of a bunch of rabbits looking to find a safe home. The part about the beautiful park-like setting where the rabbits who lived there never mentioned a rabbit that disappeared and was no longer among them (because he had been harvested by the cook)was stunning. They didn't mention the missing rabbits, indeed denied they ever even existed, because they didn't want to admit they were fed well and taken care of for eating purposes and not just living in a paradise. You can't believe how you can get caught up in a story about rabbits. But you do. And you don't want it to end. Unfortunately I was so delighted with this book that I got others by Adams. But his Maia and Shardik were just disappointing. Sometimes an author just has one great book in him. Like Harper's To Kill a Mockingbird and Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|I was flipping through tv stations awhile back and happened across the video for Bat Country.  At first I dismissed em' as just another punk kid heavy metal band... until I heard the guitar solo.  Very tastefully done!  With arpeggios to boot.  I honestly haven't heard those in popular music since the 80's.  So I decided to buy the album (that the only real way to get a true gauge of a bands sound in my opinion)  Well I wasn't dissapointed.  My only true gripe with the band is M. Shadows singing, especially on songs like M.I.A. it sounds like the vocal melody was written for notes that he just can't hit... though he tries.  The group has some songs like Trashed and Scattered which brought back some fond memories of Pantera.  All in all a very good album.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|This DVD captures Madonna's BEST tour-show BY FAR!!!  I have been a fan of Madonna's since she first came onto the scene, and I have always been impressed with the fact that she continually improves upon herself, constantly raising the bar.  I could not believe how amazing this show was, and I have no idea how she could put on such an impressive show for two hours?!?  If you are a Madonna fan and you don't own this DVD/CD set yet, then buy it NOW!!!
0143038419|2.0|This book reads like a 16 year old girl's diary. The author begins by writing about, in excruciating detail, her divorce and then subsequent breakup with a man she dated shortly after divorcing her husband. Anyone who has been or known a teenage girl needn't read that portion of the book. The rest of the book flits between interesting insights into life, trite commentary and inaccurate anecdotes about religions the author clearly doesn't understand. For example, the author suggests that practitioners of Kabbalah disregard traditional Orthodox Judaism. She also likens the Christian Coalition to the Taliban. I'm really surprised this book got so many good reviews. I found it to be mostly banal at best.
1400079179|5.0|This is the best novel I have ever read.  Dan Brown's fast paced, short chapters are addictive.
1400079179|4.0|Dan Brown takes readers on a journey deep into history, lore, secret societies, mystery school, Roman Catholic cover ups, and a world of religion versus history and the politics of it all. The Da Vinci code is about a cover up that, if proven true, could shatter the foundation of Rome. Between deciphering codes in the Louvre to battling an Opus Dei assasin, this is a tale that make conspiracy fans wild. Brown blends history, theology, and intrigue into a mystery that strikes at the heart of who is Christ, Mary Magdalene, and all those who formed the bedrock of the  Holy Roman Church. Always good to read the book before watching the movie.<br /><br />And for those who were mad at the Catholic heresy in this novel: think about it this way, The Da Vinci Code stimulated alot of controversy and debate and generate alot of free PR for the Catholics. Only the debate of two opposing ideas can the truth be sparked. Madonna did the same thing when in 2006 she did a mock cruxifiction near the Vatican as part of her confessions tour.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000EPR7NE The Da Vinci Code]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JOC9 The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
1594200823|4.0|Michael Pollan's analysis of the modern industrial food chain is fascinating, no matter which way you look at it. That we are using more energy to produce corn than we are getting back and that we have come so far in \\"engineering\\" cattle to eat something (corn) for which they have no \\"natural\\" capabilities was an unpleasant surprise to me. The environmental impacts down the line and the unintended impacts on human health makes equally unhappy reading. I agree with other reviewers that it's a very important book. Too bad it has taken so long for someone who can write to put these ideas down on paper. My only complaint is the sometimes shrill tone Pollan adopts when talking about \\"agribusiness\\" and the US Department of Agriculture. It reminds me of the wacky edge that Michael Moore brings to his work. Pollan seems to suggest at times that Big Business and the US government are somehow conspiring to maintain a surplus of corn in order to make money, knowing all the while that they are creating an environmental disaster and causing the premature deaths of millions of Americans. I don't think that holds up any better than Moore's idea in Bowling for Columbine that Big Business and The Media are conspiring to keep us all in fear in order to make money. The greed of a few can certainly have some bad consequences for the many. But I don't buy the image of corporate and bureaucratic baddies pocketing millions while the country, and maybe the whole planet, goes to hell ... do I?
B000H30B2C|1.0|I had to review this after seeing all the great reviews here. First off this movie didnt make back what it cost to make in its initial run, and was panned by most respected critics. By any reasonable computation the movie was a box office flop. Word of mouth basically killed the film after its opening weekend and here are a couple of the reasons. This film was the biggest dissapointment that I personally have ever received at the movie theater. The scenes where it looks like the ape is in love and especially the laughing and mock ice skating scenes were totally unnecessary and patently ridiculous. The special effects while impressive at times were so obviously CGI in certain scenes on the big screen that I thought I was watching a film from 15 years ago. I mean the dinosaurs in the first Jurassic park were way more believable. I my wife and 2 kids boys of 4 and 12 at the time respectively all thought the movie blew. The only time that I have been anywhere near this dissapointed in a movie that I had thought would be good was X-MEN 2. I will now say after an agonizingly thorough dressing down, that it appears I was completely wrong to assert that this film was not a commercial success. However I will restate that this film was a huge personal dissapointment, and that my whole family hated it.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|I was sitting at a cafe in Buenos Aires when this CD suddenly started playing. Within two songs there were several patrons, including myself, asking the waitresses who was that playing. There were so many in fact that one simply brought out the CD cover and we started passing it around, copying the title. Needless to say, the girls played the whole thing while everyone happily tapped their fingers and drank their beers. Excellent!
6305784116|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 15 YEAR OLD.  She remembered this movie and it was one of her favorites when she was much younger.  It is such a cute movie.  As a matter of fact our next cats are going to be named O'Malley and Duchess.  No one can go wrong with the Aristocats - young or old!
B000KRN07S|3.0|I loved Norah's first album, her second was good, but not as good, the third had me wondering and this last album is a real disappointment.  I think Norah believes she has to have dark and somber themes in order to be considered a serious artist, but her strength lies in her soothing, comforting, sensuous, \\"wrap me in a warm blanket\\" voice, which is largely absent from this work.
B000002HFU|5.0|Like common perceptions of ODB, I thought he was a clown.  After listening to this whole album, I think ODB is a modern day Screamin' Jay Hawkins.  When ODB rhymes welfare with.....welfare, not only is it hilarious, but incredibly heady as well, considering the shame associated with that word and the powerful and ironic way he rhymes it twice in a couplet.  Forget all the serious hip hop heads.  What's genius about ODB is that he's oblivious to pretension.  He's pure.

B00005JPO8|5.0|Towards the end of the movie after the fall of The Wall it seems like he lost it all...his function, his very function of serving the state, thrown aside by history like a ragdoll...just to find out that his \\"goodness\\" has been recognized by the person who matters most. An ending of such proportions on a level of human decency has not been seen in a long time! And, yes...I cried!
1582701709|4.0|Through my life I have come to realize we become what we fill our mind and bodies with.  What we concentrate our time and energy on is what we become in life. The adage \\"you are what you eat\\" can apply to our mind in that we become what we feed our mind.<br /><br />The Secret by Rhonda Byrne gives insight into how we can affect our lives through what we read, think, feel and do.  Byrne's book is an outstanding compilation of examples of how you can change your life through implementing simple \\"secrets\\" such as the power of positive thinking.<br /><br />I always find it fascinating to hear stories of others success in life.  The Secret is full of inspirational stories and practical advice on how to become successful in all areas of your life.<br /><br />If you read a few pages of this book a day and assimilate the advice and practices described, you will lead a more fulfilling life.  I recommend your keeping this book close at all times during the day to use as quick reference when challenges arise.
B000063DIR|1.0|The original version is a classic, a must have.  Randy was unreal and Ozzy voice is piercing. Bob and Lee are instrumental with their tracks, no pun intended.  However, Bob and Lee are removed from the newer CD versions and and the new drum and bass tracks just don't sound right.  How can it, when you add new drums and bass with current technology over 1981 recording techniques (and it also sounds like it was done last minute)?  Plus the fact Bob and Lee were there with Randy putting it all together; the vibe was there big time.  I hope that everyone will work out their differences and we'll see a Super DVD or DVD-Audio, or some super high resolution media released of the original version of this.  For now, find yourself the Diary of a Madman remaster version from 1995.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I had only heard Dolphy with Mingus before this album. The playing here is excellent. All the players are great. Dolphy's solos sound like they come from another place and time. Hutcherson makes the vibes sound menacing. I have never been a huge vibes fan but the use of them on these songs is perfect. Young Tony Williams also shows off his amazing ability on the drums. This type of jazz is not for everyone but after a few listens it really grows on you. There is a haunting quality to several of the tunes that is amazing.

1571200851|3.0|While this book has some fabulous and innovative ideas that add to quilt design, I found the instructions and illustrations very difficult to follow.  It seemed to leave you hanging between one-step to the other.  I took the book to work and several people could not figure it out.  However, one individual came along, took one look, and completely understood.  So, if you want a challenge, or if you are good at reading between the lines, go ahead and get the book.  I have not made a quilt but I did master the flowers on the front cover of this book.  I will probably focus on making some of the pillows.  However, for now, the book is on my shelf until I want another challenging project to work on.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is a five star experience.  Informative and <br />entertaining.  See it, no matter what you think about global <br />warming or Al Gore.  This movie is not Al Gore with a 500 <br />page PowerPoint presentation.  It is real examples from <br />around the world, nicely paced and presented.  <br /> <br />I will admit that I subscribe to the idea that global warming <br />is real.  Maybe you are reading this and think global warming <br />is real or not or you are not sure.  Regardless of your opinion, <br />consider this: Is there likely to be any harm in acting on the <br />ideas related to reducing CO2 as posed in this movie?  I mean, <br />really, could cutting pollution and waste somehow be a BAD thing? <br /> <br />I would like to discuss some \\"problems\\" I've heard with global warming: <br /> <br />1. The movie is an Al Gore love-fest.  Okay, so maybe you don't like Al <br />Gore.  Concentrate on the science and the data. <br /> <br />2. We cannot be having global warming, the global warming hearings <br />in Washington were snowed out.  It is interesting how critics of <br />global warming say that the current trend is only a small part <br />of a greater trend, and then use an even smaller trend  as \\"proof\\" <br />that global warming is a hoax. <br /> <br />3. Didn't Time/Newsweek predict a new ice age 30 years ago?  Isn't it <br />bit silly to appeal to older science to refute newer science?  Time <br />adds knowledge.  Factors that were not recognized then are recognized <br />now.   <br /> <br />I realize these 3 point/counterpoint issues may not do much to <br />describe the movie, but I hope that anyone who is reading this and <br />thinking this movie is a waste of time because they have heard these <br />arguments will at least consider seeing the movie at this point. <br />
B00008G9JM|5.0|Jethro Tull decided to contiune the idea of the concept album by following 1972's Thick As A Brick with the equally complex A Passion Play. Released in the summer of 1973, it was just behind the arrival of Pink Floyd's classic Dark Side of the Moon LP, and was striving for the same kind of innovative style that most progressive rock groups were trying to experiment with at the time. Pink Floyd's release faired much better in the long run and turned out to be a much stronger album. A  Passion Play rose to #1 on the album charts, but soon became forgotten. The album sort of strectched the imagination with thoughts of life, death, and the afterlife with some references to the second coming of God(\\"Man of passion rise again we won't cross you out\\"). Much of the lyrics are of a poetic and biblical nature, while questioning the purpose of God's existence in one of the story's best parts as is posed, \\"Tell us is it you who are here for our good cheer, or are we here for the story, for the glory, for the gory satisfaction of telling you how absolutely awful you really are?\\" Where as Pink Floyd fused rock with the blues, Jethro Tull were likely attempting a softened jazz sound as they blended the harder progressive rock with the folk rock style they always played with from the early days. The musical tones and melodies change throughout the album, leaving the listener never knowing what to expect next. Ian Anderson's flute solos are as dynamic as ever and always helped to give Jethro Tull it's uniqueness. But is this also a confusing piece of rock history? Many listeners who first purchased this album back then felt so, and had many fans questioning at the time what the group was trying to accomplish with an album they found to be much weaker than Thick As A Brick. I'd say this is one of those releases were each person is going to form their own individual opinion. Consider this an album you will either love or hate because Jethro Tull made it clear that sometimes life has no in between.
B000002W4V|5.0|Awesome live album.  I wish there was another disc worth of music!
B000KX0IOK|2.0|The film tries to depict a real slice of life, the way it would appear to the person living it.  As a result, it's boring beyond belief.  There are a few redeeming scenes, but not enough to make me want to watch it again.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This film is very accurate to the novel and is therefore highly entertaining! It is very well directed and the actors are fabulous. I loved it and watched it three time in one week, despite its length. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who enjoyed the book and to anyone who appreciates good classical literature films. It belongs in the \\"Masterpiece\\" Theatre!
B000000OA6|5.0|Proably one of the best cd Queen has did since, A Night At Opera. That and also knowing the fact that this would be Queen's last cd together. I mean, words can't begin to describe how good this cd is. Inneundo is like one musical painting. With songs like \\"Deliah, Bijou\\" and the title track itself, \\"Innuendo\\" that just inspire the imagination and the soul. But, it also has some very moving tracks too, \\"The Show Must Go On\\" and \\"These are the days of our lives\\". That are so wonderful. Innuendo is a great cd and is most defantly worth listening to.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Whether he is playing a poker hustler (Rounders) a twisted killer (Primal Fear), a thief (The Score) or a mysterious magician (The Illusionist) Edward Norton commands attention. This period film shot beautifully in golden hues and dark browns, combines an interesting plot of murder and magic with superb acting. Edward Norton is utterly convincing as an early 20th century European magician who discovers that his childhood sweetheart is about to marry a cold, brutal heir to the throne. Paul Giamatti in the role of a police investigator is quite convincing. The camera work in the film captures the aura and allure of magic with Edward Norton as the dignified master Eisenheim.  The plot moves along well with fine film editing and a solid supporting cast of actors. The one essential scene in which the entire plot hinges upon is still unclear to me. When Sophie (Jessica Beil) storms out of the palace, the prince (Rufus Sewell)follows her with sword in hand.  We then see Sophie presumably dead, slumped over a horse with a huge blood stain.  In the end we know that this is just an illusion.  But the question is how? How did Eisenheim prevent the prince from actually killing Sophie?
0064430227|5.0|Harold is a little boy who owns a magic purple crayon.  Everything he draws with it turns real, so what he had planned as just a little walk in the moonlight turns into a great adventure.  Crockett Johnson plays out this idea with great imagination and humor (I particularly enjoy the puns, such as \\"he drew up the covers\\").   <br /> <br />What makes the book great, though, is the ending.  The lost and somewhat worried Harold finds his way back home when he realizes that his bedroom window is--and always has been, always will be--\\"right around the moon\\",  and that's exactly where he draws it.  Home is where the heart is, a nice message for little kids.
0385338694|5.0|This was the first book I read in a long time and I have read 50 books since!  It got me excited about reading again.  I couldn't put it down and I read it in a few short days.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I had three surprises in theaters in 2006, all of which seemed to have the odds against them going in.  A new Superman?  It worked just fine.  A new James Bond?  The greatest cinematic makeover in history.  Now, here comes the same ol' Rocky.  And for the most part, it was another welcome return.<br /><br />If ever a person was born to play a part, Rocky Balboa is it for Sylvester Stallone.  Say what you will about the crass commercialism of Rocky's 3, 4, and 5, Sly rarely missed a beat.  Well, OK, there wasn't much to love about Rocky 5.  But even the lesser sequels got one thing right: Stallone stayed true to the character.<br /><br />Wisely, he chose to write and direct this (one can only hope) final  installment, a fitting bookend to the saga.  Stallone has always been smarter than the characters he plays, and his script strikes a good balance between drama and self-deprecating humor.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] When a bunch of young punks throw a few verbal jabs at the aging ex-champ, their words ring true. . .yet you can't help but feel for the guy.  This may be a minority opinion, but I think this is easily Stallone's finest ACTING performance of the series.  That's right, I said ACTING.<br /><br />Sure, the film eventually lapses into the predicable training montage, and maybe one too many speeches from the Italian Stallion.  But by taking the time to make you care about the characters again--it's been 16 years, after all--you may find yourself cheering in spite of yourself.<br /><br />Now, on to the DVD itself.  We get a witty and insightful commentary from the Man himself.  There's also an alternate ending that shows just how much Stallone (and Rocky) has matured. . .twenty years ago, the more predictable, less-satisfying ending would probably have made the final cut.  A bunch of delted scenes are included, offering a bit more screen time for Burt Young's Paulie (who, incidentally, also gets my vote for best performance of the six ROCKY films).<br /><br />If you've read this far, you're probably a big enough ROCKY fan to make the purchase.  It's a fine conclusion to the series, a story with heart and humor. . .and let's face it, that's become a rare combination these days.If you've read this far, you're probably a big enough ROCKY fan to make the purchase.

1416524800|5.0|This is a real page turner.  I read it in only a couple of days.  I thought it was very well written and the story line was very well researched.  A must read.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This version has a lot going for it.  The cinematography is stunning and it really captures the dark essence of the story (it actually gave me nightmares).  Ruth Wilson is a pretty good Jane.  She's young and she's almost not too pretty to play Jane.  But I'm with those who say the Clarke/Dalton version is the best because it's truer to the book and because Dalton was a superior Rochester.  Toby Stevens was milquetoast and dispassionate.  There was nothing dark or broody about him.  He even looked a bit too young.   <br /> <br />There were also too many gratuitous scenes.  I was flabbergasted at the scene where Jane tells Rochester she intends to leave him while he has her pinned to the bed, kissing her passionately and copping a feel.  In the book Jane refuses Rochester a single kiss once she knows he is married and steels herself against temptation.  It was just so out of character.  Most of the scenes where Rochester is with his snooty friends are terribly tampered with up as well (like his friend being a free thinker and as other mentioned earlier, the ouija board). Why was Miss Ingram a blonde???  Don't even get me started on the gypsy scene!  I also didn't like the ditzy portrayal of the Rivers sisters.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this despite the flaws, but there were definitely places I was disappointed.

B000E97X66|5.0|for years now, columbia records has been releasing live bob dylan shows. now they are starting with bruce and neil young. hopefully this will be just the first of many early live shows to get the cd treatment. certainly, this is a fantastic set. for springsteen fans, just getting these versions of the \\"detroit medley\\" and \\"quarter to three,\\" are a cause for celebration. the whole show is a powerhouse performance of great rock and roll, and the sound quality is very, very good. i can't recommend this thing highly enough.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|What a classic show. The box is beautiful as well, real wood with plexiglass door on front. A little tough to get the seasons out of the box though, not a lot of height from top of season box to top of holder box, but hey, small price to pay for all 10 seasons in one place.
B000003BEM|5.0|say what you will about the stones current work (i happen to enjoy it), there cannot be much argument over the fact that the string of studio albums they released from 1968 on through 1972 is one of the most amazing outpourings of rock and roll greatness ever achieved. \\"beggars banquet\\" was the album which started that incredible run of creativity. it contains two of the greatest rock anthems of all-time in \\"sympathy for the devil\\" and \\"street fighting man,\\" and a whole bunch of other great stuff, including three heavenly acoustic blues numbers: \\"no expectations,\\" \\"dear doctor,\\" and the rollicking \\"prodigal son.\\" there's also a couple of hard-edged bluesy rockers, \\"parachute woman\\" and \\"stray cat blues,\\" which show that the stones in this era could not be touched by any other white boys when it came to performing raw lowdown blues. elsewhere we get \\"factory girl,\\" an endearing sort of urban folk song with mandolin and great percussion work. there's also the quirky \\"jigsaw puzzle,\\" with its great bass pattern and a jagger vocal that bursts with personality. the album ends with \\"salt of the earth,\\" a mid-tempo anthem for the faceless crowd. catchy chorus on this one. you can hum along. and the piano takes us on out. don't miss this great masterpiece. <br /> <br />
0783226837|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was with my dad. He rented it and I thought oh man, another cheesy sci-fi movie. But after watching it, it's hilarious.

B000002J0B|5.0|boom: \\"the song remains the same.\\" boom: \\"the rain song.\\" boom: \\"over the hills and far away.\\" right up front three classics hit the listener. \\"the rain song\\" in particular, is, i think, one of zepplin's finest moments, standing up to anything on any of their albums. the melody on that song is about as good as any melody in rock history. classic string arrangement, too. moving on, \\"the crunge,\\" is a strange moment in zepplin's discography: a funk freakout! but, hey, it works. \\"dancing days,\\" is a joyful ditty with a quirky riff, and \\"d'yer mak'er\\" follows with more happy quirkiness in sound. confuses me a bit, though. the singer is singing about being dumped by his girl, the words he sings are not happy ones, yet he's accompanied by a quasi-reggae beat that is all sunshine and fun. getting dumped and being heartbroken never sounded so joyful. go figure. then comes \\"no quarter,\\" an eerie piece of psychedelia with a jazzy guitar solo tucked away inside. great track, but it sounds out of place, sandwiched between all those other joyous sounds, which we return to on the closing number, \\"the ocean.\\" good time music, and out. a great album from led zepplin. who's surprised?

B000002OZY|5.0|personally, i am not really down with the idea of rock operas. maybe my attention span feels threatened by such concepts. i don't know. anyway, you see that i gave this 5 stars. here execution trumps concept in my heart. there is simply too much great music contained on this album not to give it it's due. \\"overture\\" and \\"underture\\" are about as elegant and classy as rock music gets. the whole affair really allows keith moon and john entwhistle to shine with outstanding drum and bass patterns, as townshend's signature power chords are absent here. acoustic guitar textures are prominent in place of the usual electric thrashings. and things in general are tasteful and subtle, layered on top of the great rhythm work. daltrey's vocals are in excellent form, too. seldom has his voice been equal to the sensitive nuances of expression that he brings to this song cycle. no, i do not want or need anymore rock operas in my life, but i am begrudgingly ecstatic that this one exists. a classic rock album, for sure.
B000IFQLSW|4.0|I so love guitar and blues.  This is a ride through the music that created both country and rock.

B000068UXF|5.0|Strauss' Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow) asks more of the opera viewer than many operas do.  You have to be willing to look beyond the surface at deeper levels of meaning, and at the meaning of life and human interactions.<br /><br />If you're still reading, after hearing about that tough \\"homework\\" assignment mentioned above, let me continue, by telling you that this performance is worth the investment on your part.  Contrary to what a couple of reviews have said, the acting is very good.  Perhaps some were critical because much of this work is rather supernatural, which is something actors do not usually have to convey.<br /><br />If you like Wagner's Ring, or Strauss' Elektra, Salome, Ariadne, or even Arabella or Rosenkavalier, you'll feel at home with Frau ohne Schatten.<br />Besides the powerful singing, and dark sets from the world of the supernatural, you'll hear Solti at his best, superbly handling those<br />\\"terrible\\" (in the good sense of terrible) Straussian chords, as Jessye Norman once called them.  It leads to a profoundly satisfying finale, featuring \\"those terrible chords.\\"
B00006AW2G|5.0|from 1968 thru 1972 the stones created \\"beggars banquet,\\" \\"let it bleed,\\" \\"sticky fingers,\\" and \\"exile on main st.\\" what other band can boast such a majestical string of classics in such a short period. from the eerie opening sounds of \\"gimmie shelter,\\" a song that has an air of menace, a flavor of tension to it, on out through the album finale, the great \\"you can't always get what you want,\\" this is an album of powerhouse music. rock and roll touched by some heavenly muse. there are three acoustic blues numbers here, and no white boys could ever do a blues number like the stones could in this era. they seemed completely at ease with the blues, took to it so natural. their cover of robert johnson's \\"love in vain\\" is totally compelling, fresh, and moving. the country-blues hoe-down number \\"country honk,\\" with violin and a ragged vocal by keith, is equally fresh and exciting. it is \\"you got the silver,\\" though, which is the most excellent of these 3 acoustic blues cuts. this is keith's best vocal ever, and his slide work is divine. a beautiful, beautiful tune. more fine slide guitar work from keith is found on the title cut, a honky-tonk rocker with a heavy boogie beat, and a loose relaxed vocal from jagger. \\"midnight rambler,\\" with its driving beat, funky harmonica, and freaky slide guitar flourishes, matches the tension and menacing atmospherics of \\"gimme shelter\\" note for note. and did i forget \\"live with me?\\" that great heart-thumping rocker with tenor saxophone fireworks from bobby keys? and how about \\"monkey man?\\" a great rock anthem, celebrating misfits and our animal nature, with guitar wizardry provided by keith. and lastly, there is, of course, \\"you can't always get what you want.\\" that song is simply one of the great songs of the rock and roll canon. and what's with this al kooper fella? isn't he the guy who played the organ on dylan's classic \\"like a rolling stone?\\" another all-time great of rock music's canon. he plays organ on \\"you can't always get whatyou want,\\" too. and french horn, to boot. seems the guy carried a load of luck with him into a recording session. anyway, you definitely need this album. no doubt about it. make the kids skip a few meals if you are short on cash. this is more important. believe me.
0440241413|5.0|I think this whole series is just terrific.  I am about to start the Shopaholic & Baby and am so looking forward to it.  Sophie Kinsella has created a character that becomes a friend, which is why I keep reading the next 'installment' of her (Becky's) life.  It is so easy to read that I think this book and series is the perfect mini-escape from a very busy life.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|EYE IN THE SKY is yet another great CD by the Alan Parsons Project. It's been described by reviewers as being about how, if we're not careful, technology will control humans, but in reality, it also has a much deeper message, which is about how commercialism and advertising will eventually lead us to do things which are unhealthy for us. It's this message which inspires me to look good for a number of pretty actresses by not falling victim to things like junk-food and fast-food ads on TV and radio.
B000MTDRKE|3.0|First off, I have been a huge Neal Morse fan since 2000, and have remained a loyal fan, despite his obsession with solely writing lyrics that reflect his religious ideology.  His first two solo records after leaving Spock's Beard and prog supergroup, Transatlantic, \\"Testimony\\" and \\"One,\\" were both very good.  Then, in 2005, he released a record, the \\"Question Mark\\" album, that was as good as anything he had done with Spock's Beard from a musical standpoint.  The lyrics, however, continued to get more and more overtly religious.     Which brings us to his new album, \\"Sola Scriptura.\\"  First off, the subject matter is very controversial, as it is about Martin Luther, the German theologian, who made a name for himself in the 16th century with his radical teachings and anti-Semitic writings.  The lyrics on \\"Sola Scriptura,\\" in short, are almost an attack on what Morse considers \\"false religions\\"...and he is not shy about using strong words to convey his beliefs.  I never thought I would hear the word 'w****' used multiple times on a Neal Morse record.      The lyrics would be easy to deal with if the music were up to his usual standards, but sadly, it is not.  Morse's style has gotten more and more formulatic over the years, and he seems to have hit a brick wall.  This album has three songs in the 20-30 minute range (plus a short ballad, which is rather mediocre), but none of them are cohesive, memorable, or well-flowing.  Each song seems to contain random sections stitched together for the sake of having an epic.  And the songs all just end.  No huge build-up.  No heavenly crescendos.  They just end.  Were these songs really written by the same guy who gave us classic epics like \\"At the End of the Day,\\" \\"The Light,\\" \\"Stranger in Your Soul (with the help of Roine Stolt and his other TA members),\\" and \\"The Doorway?\\"    I fear that Morse is so preoccupied with delivering his lyrical message that he is content with doing the same old, same old, when it comes to the music,but this Neal Morse fan is very disappointed with how formulatic and predictable his music has become.  On a first listen, I could almost pick out the spots where the Gentle Giant-like harmonies were going to come in, or where a particular drum roll would be used, etc.  I think you get my drift.     The playing, as always on a Neal Morse album, is outstanding.  Morse's keyboard and acoustic guitar work is top-notch as always, and his electric guitar playing continues to get better.  Guest star Paul Gilbert delivers some nice moments, bassist Randy George is solid as usual, and prog metal drummer Mike Portnoy gives his usual strong performance, but unfortunately, the music they are playing simply isn't up to the usual Neal Morse standards, if you ask me.  The melodies that stick in your head for days are not there.  There weren't any Neal Morse vocal moments that made me want to instantly rewind the cd to immediately listen to it again.     I gave this cd 3 stars for the simple reason that an average Neal Morse album is still better than a great majority of what is out there right now, but he can do better than this.  And given his history of writing great music, I suspect he will.
1582701709|5.0|The book is extremely good.  I am finding it to be very beneficial in my life.  I have given copies to each of my grown children because I think it will help them also.  I have donated a copy to the school library in hopes that it will help the high school students in our school. I have also recommended the book to several friends.
1582701709|3.0|I think the concept is phenomenal.  I personally have lived this way for most of my adult life.  This is probably why, I feel like the book was unneccesarily repetetive.  If you may not have heard or used the concept that is drilled into you in this book, you can truly learn something to better your life and circumstances.  However, if you already live, breathe and sleep this way, you cannot get into the book because the concept is already known to you.  It is interesting that the hype for this book was soo much I bought 2 copies.  One for my personal library and the other to share with friends.   <br /> <br />I must say that my 16 year old liked the book immensley and when he is about to say something negative, I interrupt him and I say \\"What does the secret tell you to do\\".  So in one way it has helped my son realize this way of life and given me vehicle to help him attain it.
1582701709|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I have purchased my own copy and sent copies to friends and family.  To me, the message is deeper than just \\"positive thinking\\".  It is about how your outlook can change your self image, strengthen your relationships with others, and open your life to new opportunities and experiences.  When you change your view of your current life situation, you begin to see the benefits and lessons as well as appreciate where you are right now in your life's journey.<br /><br />I have also watched the video associated with the book.  I enjoyed reading the book first and watching the video afterwards because it only reinforced what I had read.  I highly recommend this book.

0515127485|4.0|After reading \\"Enigma\\" last year, I was surprised to see that Harris can actually write an interesting story. Some of the same flaws in Enigma are found here too in Archangel. The most obvious flaw is continuity. Rapava tells a story and sometimes it's hard to determine if the story is taking place in the present or in the past, on the night of Stalin's death. Fortunately, once the story continues after the Rapava's testimony, the story takes a more definite plot.<br /><br />Russia is described as a depressing land, with despair and corruption overflowing the streets of Moscow. I think it's unfair to think of Moscow that way. After all, we Americans feared the Russians for decades, so now that the Cold War is over, there's no reason to deplore each other anymore.<br /><br />Stalin's death has always been a mystery kept under the strictest secrecy just as Reagan's progressive madness during his prolonged presidency. Harris really committed himself to the story, and although depressing, it's also interesting. Kelso goes to great lengths to discover the mysteries written in a diary attributed to Stalin himself, and by doing that, he goes to Archangel and meets Stalin's son and successor. Now, that's good storytelling! A Soviet Messiah comes from he frozen Artic to save the Motherland and make her again the feared world power Stalin envisioned.<br /><br />The storyline was well written although al little shaking at the beginning, excellent topic for a novel, and well crafted as a mystery novel. Next book, \\"Fatherland.\\"<br /><br />P.S. The color yellow appears repeatedly throughout the entire novel: yellow snow, yellow clouds, yellow river, yellowish sky, water and air. Does it have a meaning? Just curious.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, \\"Das Boot\\" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, \\"The Perfect Storm\\". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.<br /><br />Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.<br /><br />As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.<br /><br />The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several \\"making of\\" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall.ve former mayor of New York (huh?).

B00008973A|1.0|A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!  <br />(the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it!)
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book. As I read it I felt like I was learning the \\"secret\\" of the universe. I felt it from the inside out. As if my soul was speaking to me as I read saying, yes, this is it, this is the truth. Now, I've read many books along the similar vein such as Tony Robbins's Unlimited Power, Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and Psychocybernetics, another really excellent book, by Maxwell Maltz. All great books, and I learned a lot from each of them. But sometimes just the way someone writes a book, the way they say the same thing you've read many times before, just hits you the right way and you say, Ok, I get it! Finally! That is what happened to me when I read The Secret. I pay a lot more attention to how and what I am thinking. To go another step beyond this, check out Noah St. Johns books on Afformations. The more clear we become about our thoughts, the more powerful we will be in our lives.
B0006GANOQ|4.0|This 1994 matchup of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock would not be the last pairing of this couple. This fortunate outcome for movie viewers makes it even more fascinating to watch the chemistry between the two back in 1994 when they did not trip off the tongue easily as a twinned male-female leads.<br /><br />The flashes of humor that pass between them in this flick are brilliant, all the more so because the bomb-rigged bus they're maneuvering through LA, knowing that if bus and passengers will blow up if their speed goes below 50 mph, provides a death trap as a background.<br /><br />The two wryly observe that relationships that begin under high-stress circumstances don't last. This reviewer is glad to file Bullock and Reeves in SPEED as an exception.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper pulls a great turn as a heartless but very smart psycho terrorist. He's only in it for the money, so the show can move on without having to get the audience up to speed on any complicated grievances flowing from the past into Hopper's absurdly expressive brain.<br /><br />Back to Reeves and Bullock, it's almost preternatural how cool the former can appear and how girl-next-door the latter. A lot of cinematic water has flowed under the bridge since the first SPEED back in the 90's. Reeves' and Bullocks repertoires have considerably expanded.<br /><br />All the better than that such fun can come out of an evening's watching how they established a relationship (in role and as actors) under this most stressful of circumstances.
B0001WGDXK|5.0|Bernstein was an interpretive conductor.  This is a performance which makes an event out of the 2nd symphony.  The Breitkopf and Hartel score includes a duration of 45 minutes under the scoring page.  Bernstein's performance is not far off.  As personal as his intrepretation is (including a few changes in dynamics), most of Sibelius' tempo markings are meticulously followed.  Molto largamente, Andante sostenuto, Poco allegro, Allegro, are tempo markings which appear in the 2nd movement - all are followed.  Bernstein rigorously applies the 'Tempo Andante, ma rubato' to the eight-note (3/8), not the quarter.  As a result, the 2nd movement is taken at a slower pace.  But the pacing is entirely logical within that context.  Careful listeners will also notice that one measure of the 3rd movement Vivacissimo (taken in 1 - one of the fastest on record) equals exactly one quarter note of the tempo in the finale.  These correspondences (and there are many) give cohesiveness to the structure of the work.<br /><br />The 2nd movement, one of the great tragic symphonic utterances, and the finale, one of the most uplifting in the repertoire, are perfectly realized in this great performance.  Absolutely not to be missed.

B000E5N62U|5.0|This album's title track refers to a ghostly cat-like entity that floats above the big apple bringing good cheer, and making everyone feel good.  The album itself reflects upon the later days of one's life.  Death was chiefly on Fagan's mind, or at least the contemplation of it.  The tragic events in that city, nearly six years ago already, figured heavily in the mindset of Morph the Cat.  Darkly humorous as only Fagan could do it, it is of course a must-have for any Steely Dan Fan.  And they are back on tour this spring on the East Coast. The song 'Mary Shut the Garden Door is a point-blank reference to the current administration.  It is as circumspect a commentary on current times as  much as \\"Sign in Stranger\\"  was to the supposed presence of Alien life forms visiting our planet, and, if Chris Bell knows anything about it, he tells us as much in his short story from \\"Bumper Crop of Lies. Food for thought:  just how does anyone take a yo-yo for a ride?  And, by the Way, just how did Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter get the nickname, and what does he do now?  Far from jamming riffs, he is a political scientist of some note, with expertise in foriegn affairs....extraterrestrial anyone?  As with anything Fagan/Becker do, this one is like an onion, with many layers of fun and meaning to the initiated.  Try, you'll like!
B00001U0E1|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is the rarest of films. It is at once intelligent and witty; comical and serious; romantic and swashbuckling. It evokes the mid to late 16th century with Oscar nods for costume design and \\"art Direction-set Decoration\\". But my personal favorite, when it came to historical accuracy, was the throwing of waste water from houses/taverns directly into the street. We saw this when Geoffrey Rush's fantastic comic character Philip Henslowe trudged about the streets. The emptied waste buckets landed either just in front of him, or behind him. That served as a just reminder to any who might have overly romantic notions about living in that time. Sewage systems had yet to be perfected.    Joseph Fiennes received the same snub at the Oscars that DiCaprio had just one year prior: he appeared in almost all of the scenes, yet wasn't nominated. That's more than passing strange. How is it that an actor can appear in nearly the entire film, yet not be judged as lending to its perceived greatness (it won 7 Oscars)?    The entire ensemble worked quite well together; indeed, they were awarded with the Actor for Best Ensemble from the Screen Actors Guild. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, Gwyneth Paltrow as Shakespeare's muse, Violet (both of whom won Oscars for their roles), and Geoffrey Rush were highlights. Judi Dench turned in what must now be known as a \\"Hopkins performance\\". Hopkins was on the screen for 15 minutes in [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs]], and won Best Supporting Actor. Dench was on screen for a reported 8 minutes, and she won Best Supporting Actress.    The Amazon reviewer indicated that it would take a Shakespearean scholar to \\"dissect the numerous parallels\\", and when I saw this first in the theatre, in 1998, I thought the same myself. Watching it again today, I wish I'd spent more time brushing up on Shakespeare. The screen writers brilliantly used real people (Christopher Marlowe, Henslowe, Burbage), and I know that several \\"jokes\\" werelost on me. I'm not sure that I'm going to spend the requisite time brushing up on Shakespeare (is there such a thing without immersion?), but the movie caused such desire within me.

There's tons of action and none of the cheesey computer animation and dumb gadgets that the Pierce Brosnan Bond seemed to rely on so much during the last couple movies. They even slipped some humor in there and had a few nice laughs. Overall, oustanding movie!
B000E1KN7U|5.0|There's almost nothing to say about this album. Really. I will therefore make only two statements concerning it. One, it's one of the BEST albums of all time. BY ANY BAND. EVER. I will not argue about it, nor will I respond to those who disagree. My statement is a hard, cold, measureable scientific fact. Any dissenting opinions are just that. Opinions.  <br /> <br />Second statement. This ALBUM is NOT for EVERYONE. Not everyone will understand it. NOR ARE THEY MEANT TO. Not everyone understands Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Cole, or other musical genii of their caliber. THIS ALBUM comes straight from the artist, WITHOUT passing through the preprocessed, pasteurizng, plasticizing, domesticizing, neutering cookie-cutter castrator of the Modern Music Industry-  somehow, it managed to avoid getting snapped up by the Musical Sterilization Machine that has been slicing and dicing music into bite-sized, convenient and easily digestible individually wrapped bites that Mom can guiltlessly slip into your lunch box on your way out to school every morning, safe in the assurance that it has been fortified with ADA approved vitamins and minerals. This MEANS that this ALBUM is DANGEROUS TO THE STATUS QUO. IT IS RAW AND UNFETTERED IN ITS EMOTION, it is pure, raw unadulterated ROCK that delves into the fear and darkness in the human psyche, and lays it open for all to see. IF you CANNOT DEAL WITH THAT, if you HAVE ACCEPTED that all music MUST sound a certain way, AND CANNOT ABIDE BY THE RAW, UNRESTRICTED  ENERGY and IDEAS pouring directly into YOUR brain from Fripp and Co. via this album; If you are fearful and timid, and have allowed yourself to be musically  castrated by the *&^%$! on the radio, then YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM. <br /> <br />PS just because something has a lot of screaming, cussing, is deliberately Satanic and/or is denigrating to women doesn't make it raw and energetic like this album- this album confronts pure darkness on a level that would make these \\"rappers\\"and \\"metal bands\\"  responsible for the list of above musical nusiances run screaming, with tears in their eyes, for Mooommmy. <br /> <br />THATS ALL. NUFF SAID. <br />-Courtney Patricia 'GamerGirl' Parsons

Ex- A Farm boy with a destiny...raised by his uncle...(who dies!) parents mysteriously missing from the picture.  In fact Eargon was very much like Luke Skywalker!  I thought the characters could have been more original.  It had already been done.

I would highly recommend the accompanying dvd with footage of the songs.  I just hope that we don't get screwed when his archives box comes out and I would have to repurchase this and Filmore.
0743496728|5.0|After a disappointing last novel, \\"The Tenth Circle\\", Jodi Picoult comes back with a riveting story ripped from the headlines. A young boy goes on a rampage in a New Hampshire high school killing and wounding scores of kids. As in other Picoult books, she presents a variety of sides with no easy answers, and actually ends up provoking more questions for the reader. It would be easy to write an open and shut case of a disturbed boy who simply snaps, but the genius here is that we see the transformation through his past, and empathize with how horribly he's treated by the 'popular kids' in school. Picoult's characters are realistic, messy, selfish, and conflicted, just like life. And that's what makes this book and her writing so good.

B000001ES9|3.0|\\"Rush\\" is a decent debut album.  If you read the \\"authorized\\" book \\"Contents Under Pressure\\", you'll learn that Rush had been playing these songs for 3 or more years before recording this album, so that means they were teenagers when they wrote these originally (they were 20 when they recorded this).  I think if you take that into account, this is actually a surprisingly good album, but obviously nowhere near what they would become, even on the next album \\"Fly by Night\\".  The \\"baby baby\\" lyrics can be annoying, but the music is decent.  \\"Working Man\\" is a classic song and sounds good even today.  Every true Rush fan will own this album, but it's still worthwhile for any fan of 70's hard rock. <br />

074356619X|5.0|I can't say enough good things about the Secret. I have listened to it on CD 4 times and I'm sure I will listen at least that many more. The Secret has had a huge impact on me. I have put it into action in every aspect of my life. I have vision boards all over place. Trust me this is one secret you just won't be able to keep to yourself!
B00000E2WH|5.0|<br />The damning comment below is totally unjust and unreliable as the reviewer's view is completely clouded and distorted by his own personal dislike of Karajan as a person, that has nothing to do with either the conductor as musician nor content of this CD (what does Karajan's career strategy with Nazis, true or not, have to do with the recording!) <br /> <br />Karajan's reading of Finlandia is not a bombastic statement of Finnish nationalism, yet has weight and dignity with much emphasis on bass and the gloriously opulent sound from the orchestra. <br /> <br />The other three works are masterfully shaped and vividly captured with imagination. A fine addition to Karajan's Sibelius recordings.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is such a good movie! It is clever and funny without being ridiculous. I'm not really someone who watches Hugh Grant films, but the guy is perfect in this role. The supporting cast is also great! This is a good movie for anyone,male or female young or old. A worthy purchase that you will watch again and again. Nice DVD transfer too.
B000089RVX|5.0|Very satisfied - great music - real talent!
B0000639FE|5.0|This is a very good film and does not deserve the \\"chic flick\\" label it has been given(Even though it has one of the all time sappy lines in it \\"you had me at hello\\"....hoo boy)! I still dig the movie alot! One to watch again and again. The DVD is a good transfer.
B00008CLOA|5.0|No need to point out that this masterpiece is a must have for everyone's collection, regardless of taste.<br /><br />I've owned 5 versions of this album, two on vinyl (original and remastered) and two on CD (original and remastered), and I owned this SACD surround sound version for some time but only recently bought an SACD player to be able to hear the surround effects. This is a fantastic experience and reveals many little nuances that - even after listening to it a million times - I never noticed before. And, of course, hearing Money's cash register alternate in the left and right rear speakers is really something else. A very immersive experience and refreshing new 'version' of a very familiar old friend..... If you have an SACD player, go get it!
B0009RCPY8|4.0|I remember really liking the first one in the theater. It just seems to have lost something over the years. Still a great deal for the two films. The first is a classic and the second is certainly watchable. The DVD transfer is quite good on the 2 pack edition.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode.  Funny, suspenseful, nerdy...everything I like about sci-fi in one show.  I had never seen the original series, but saw 'Rose' on BBC america, and couldn't stop watching it.  I immediately bought the first season and picked up the second after it was released.  Can't wait to see the third series.

B000LC55F2|5.0|This wonderful tale of two battling magicians is too wonderfully complex to describe. The act of magic is described in its three parts - \\"the pledge,\\" in which the audience is introduced to an object of interest; \\"the turn,\\" in which the object is transformed, and \\"the prestige,\\" in which the object is restored. The movie itself is probably built on these three concepts, though a single viewing is hardly enough to say for sure. But superb writing keeps the audience guessing through a maze of false appearances and hidden motivations. Like a real magic trick, the viewer wonders how it was done - how was perception manipulated so subtly so that what one thinks one sees is not what is there at all?<br /><br />Working class Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and aristocratic Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are the dueling early-20th century English prestidigitators. The stakes are high: the revelation of Borden's greatest trick - The Transported Man. The trick is a doozy, involving an impossible disappearance and reappearance. Borden - as great a magician as he is lousy a showman -- has perfected the trick - eerily so - and though Angier can duplicate it, he becomes obsessed with learning how Borden did it. Managing to obtain Borden's secret diary and compromise mistress, Angier travels to Colorado where he is led to ever-spooky electronics genius Nicola Tesla.<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is itself one enormous illusion. There are so many twists and turns and reversals, that neither the characters nor the viewer can truly follow the action. This required a prodigious feat of intelligent writing, but it is pulled off admirably. The plot illusions, like their magical counterparts, are obvious when the viewer knows how they are done. One of the movie's special pleasures is to rewatch it knowing how the illusions are done. Amazingly, character motivations and actions that \\"read\\" one way the first time, read perfectly well in the opposite direction as well. Incredible.<br /><br />Michael Caine was a standout in the film - the old showman always concealing as much as he revealed. Jackman was passable - his sullen stage manner made one wonder how his character became so famous. Bale was alternately an emotional cipher and an engaging husband, father and magician. I would like to think that this was in keeping with the film's secret, of which you will not hear a word from me. And a surprise - David Bowie made the most amazing, low-key and proudly weird Tesla ever. He was mysterious, spookily intelligent and convincingly obsessed with his inventions.<br /><br />A most tightly-wrought and exquisitely-produced film.<br /><br />...and now you don't.in the film - the old showman always concealing as much as he revealed.

B0000844M8|5.0|I have two young boys and they both enjoyed this movie, and want to watch it again--always a good endorsement. The animals are adorable, and you also get a true lesson about wildlife and what it takes to survive. Only one truly scary scene at the beginning was tolerated by the youngest--it was not as graphic as it could have been. It is truly a cute, funny and instructional film.

B000GRUS22|5.0|Enigma continues to be original and high quality. Producer Michael Cretu expands his epic sound with an album that's more abstract and electronic than its predecessors, and seems more sinister in tone. Intense synthesizers and slow, deep rhythms occupy the beginning of the album, with memorable lyrics in the last half. Tracks three and four must be Enigma's most forboding yet. Enigma blends the industrial / electrical with the ghostly like I've never heard before.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Who would have expected Sylvester Stallone to be able to squeeze yet another movie out of his internationally successful Rocky series? Well, friends, the guy may have aged with the rest of us but Stallone's ability to go to the heart of the character he has made an icon still is strong. As a result ROCKY BALBOA, though overly sentimental at times (which is in keeping with the Rocky we have all grown to know) plays as a show of strength not only in the boxing ring, but also in the viability of the heart.<br /><br />The aged Rocky runs a restaurant named after his deceased wife Adrian (who gratefully appears in flashbacks of the original Talia Shire) where he chats with his devoted customers as the still admired boxing hero of Philadelphia. His trainer Paulie (Burt Young) has aged too, but the two remain close.  Rocky also encounters a lonely single mother Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and befriends her and her racially mixed son Steps (James Francis Kelly III). Mildly estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia) who is trying to make a life for himself in his father's shadow, Rocky happens to see a spoof on television placing Rocky as the contender against the new heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver, a boxer who was groomed as an actor for this film), a fighter who lacks soul and seems to foretell the end of passionate boxing. With such a huge support group Rocky decides to train and actually compete, fighting Dixon with multiple incentives. The ending demonstrates the power of willpower and the greater power of humanity and love because 'you gotta keep movin' forward'.<br /><br />ROCKY BALBOA, then, is a fine finish for a series of films that have gained a permanent place in the history of cinema.  It is a pleasure to see Sylvester Stallone act and direct a very fine cast of actors in a genuinely satisfying film.  There are many worthwhile messages with the frames of this old-fashioned movie.  Grady Harp, March 07
0515141429|5.0|This is the first novel in the Jack Reacher series, but chronologically there is a short story that precedes it in time (see the Thriller collection).  Jack Reacher left the Army six months before and has been traveling the country, eking out money he received with his discharge.  Events lead him to the small town of Musgrave, Georgia, where he just wants to find some information about a blues musician, Blind Blake, who was said to have died in the town.  He walks into a murder investigation, immediately arrested and accused.  Strangers in town, expecially a small town, are easy to blame for any misfortune.<br /><br />Reacher might have left town again, but when it turns out the victim was his brother, he is drawn into the case.  He used to be in the Military Police, specializing in homicides.  Reacher is a dangerous man when provoked, having previously dealt with highly trained killers in the military, and guilty parties make the mistake of trying to take him out.<br /><br />Bodies accumulate as the bad guys kill people, and Reacher adds to the body count.  There are some gruesome murders.  The nature of crimes in the town, and guilty parties, gradually becomes evident.  But there are some twists and some surprises.  To say there is a blazing finish is an understatement.  As in later novels in the series, Reacher finds it is best to be an old soldier and fade away.<br /><br />I would rate the novel, at best, PG13 leaning towards adult only.  You will learn a little along the way about economics and money supply, and why other countries are a step ahead of the US with their paper currency.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|This one brings back so many memories from the early 80's!  That is what I think is the best part of listening to this CD! <br />My favorite track is \\"stone in love\\" because of the 2nd half of the song's rock montage!  It always gets me psyched up for anything!  Not to forget the rest of the tracks, which range from great love ballads to simple blues rock.  I highly recommend this one, which is Journey's greatest CD!
B00008DDRX|4.0|\\"Le Mans\\" is Steve McQueen's homage to the famous French 24 hour auto endurance race.  The storyline features McQueen in a nicely understated performance as a racer returning to competition at Le Mans one year after a nearly fatal accident, one in which a close friend was killed.  The movie follows his intense competition with an old rival on the track, and his slowly blossoming relationship off the track with the widow of his close friend.<br /><br />Much of the movie is given over to an almost loving examination of all the sights and sounds of Le Mans and of the racers and the fans it attracts.  Michel LeGrand's score nicely supports the fast/slow pacing of the movie on and off the track.  The racing scenes are well done, using a variety of camera angles and lighting effects.  The race is hard to follow during a rainy night in the middle of the competition.  The racers are often hard to distinguish from one another in their helmets and protective gear.<br /><br />The movie has a number of highlights.  One is an accident on the track that threatens to take McQueen prematurely out of the competition.  A second moment, of almost pitch-perfect clarity, is McQueen's explanation to the widow of why men race automobiles.  A third is the tense conclusion of the race itself.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to fans of endurance autoracing and of Steve McQueen.
B000002TLX|4.0|Richard Marx was and is highly underrated!  His music is the classic mainstream pop rock the brings back memories of the late 80's and early 90's!  My favorite track is \\"Satified\\" because just listening to it when you feel down can bring you back up and your whole mood will change.  Mr. Marx has a unique raspy voice that separates him from the rest which only his songs require. <br />I highly recommend this CD.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I haven't been able to take it out of my CD player since I got it. If you only know one or two of Damien's songs, odds are they are on this CD - mostly thanks to them being used in the movie Closer. But the entire album is just brilliant!
1878424319|5.0|This book is well written. Like a conversation it flows easily. The principles are simple and made clear. <br /> <br />The book deals somewhat in magical thinking, but more so in cause and effect. It does not advocate a head-in-the-sand approach, but rather what to focus your dialog on. It is a merging of ideas from many arenas - personal responsibility, positive thinking, matters of the heart, clear boundaries. <br /> <br />I found the book very easy to read. And it synthesized ideas from a lot of other places. It's a great summation of what the Castenada novels sought to present through story. <br /> <br />This is a very easy self-help read. If there are people confused with all the deep principle books out there, this could be a real help. I definitely felt uplifted after reading it. <br /> <br />Following these principles can surely change your life, because they will change your heart (your intention). If you seek to see love, you will find it. As the author shows, you can surround yourself with these principles and you will be able to live on your own terms. Is there really any other path to take?
0757302661|5.0|As a practitioner trained in HypnoBirthing and as a certified doula (professional labor supporter), I can wholeheartedly recommend this book and the method it presents. HypnoBirthing is a way to be profoundly present in your birthing experience, to release your fears and anxieties about the birth and embrace with awe and wonder your body and its amazing ability to bring a new little person into the world. Marie is passionate about teaching women to trust their bodies and allow them to do what they are made to do. This book is an incredible tool to help you attain the calm, peaceful birth you deserve.

074356619X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it reminded me how powerful our minds are.  For some reason I had forgotten this, so I needed to learn it one more time.  The first time I read what the secrets of our living conditions are was in the New Testimont of the Bible.  Then again in the Magic of Finhorn and now the Secret.  Thanks so much for the reminder.
B000NA28IE|2.0|WARNING: BOOK SPOILERS <br />Come on now, I don't see what the problem was! As someone said before, everything doesn't have to be a kids movie so why bother making it short? Kids like LOTR you know! They're not exactly short, and look how great they are! Things in the books are unnecessarily left out, such as Katrina, Saphira growing up (hello? it just takes about a minute of a few simple shots with some music in the background!), like, the real Murtagh, Arya's ears (and hey, maybe mention that she's an elf! Kinda important ya know...), the real glory of Tronjheim, Angela [without the beads], Eragon's futere-telling, Solembum (HELLO? WAKE UP! He's the BEST CHARACTER!), Jeod, half the villages they travel to, the Ra'zaccs' cloaks beaks and body shape (what's up with the crawling worms in the face?), Eragon and Saphira's relationship (they become sister/brother pals overnight), Sloan, Togira Ikonaka \\"The Cripple Who Is Whole,\\" and ORIK! Yeah, I think I named just a few things, not to mention half the dialogue was lousy, the other half acceptable but the exact opposite of the book. <br /> <br />If you enjoy seeing a fabulous, richly detailed, passionate, dynamic and unique BOOK be RIPPED TO PIECES, then be my guest, get this movie, but if you do U R SICK. Who wants to see a great story be shredded like that? I, for one, am appalled how they can give it the same title.  <br /> <br />Must give it credit for special effects and Saphira is very well done, but how about timing?? Special effects are cool and all, but you need to pace yourself, and the special effects in Eragon are running a ten mile marathon, and they start running out of breath at about the third mile, which is why the last seven miles are CRAP, and rushed and TERRIBLE. I was seriously looking forward to seeing Tronjheim, but nope... guess they couldn't afford to build a huge saphire, but hey: WHY MAKE A MOVIE IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THE BEST IT CAN BE? <br /> <br />If you enjoy disappointment, then please, byall means, get this movie. Be disappointed. It doesn't matter to me, I'm just here to give you a review.  <br /> <br />I gave this two stars because although everything is backwards and messed up and scrambled, there are a few parts which are splendid, such as the first five minutes or so of the movie. I loved the village of Carvahall even if we only see it once, and I enjoyed Saphira's egg hatching. I think Roran and Eragon's relationship was well displayed as well. This is about the only things that are FAIR. Jeremy Irons was wonderful but there's only so much you can do with an AWFUL script.  <br /> <br />Thanks for the effort, but all thumbs down. Try again, but next time, read the book.
B000060OFT|5.0|I purchased the Romeo and Juliet DVD with Olivia Hussy for my daughter for her 15th Birthday. I had seen this when it originally ran in theaters back some 30 to 40 years ago.  Wonderful that my daughter and I can now watch this and enjoy it together today because she is very into Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  She is also a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio so I purchased the Special Edition for her also.  She watches and enjoys both and I had the experience of watching the DiCaprio version along with her for the first time.  So nice to be able to share something with my teenage daughter that we enjoy together.  Her music and other interests are really not too much of this mom's thing. <br />
1582701709|5.0|The Secret has something to offer everyone! It's a great book for zeroing in on your thinking patterns and approach to life. Everything begins with a thought, and becoming more aware of your thoughts is a major component in creating the perfect life. I've tried a number of their suggestions, with great success!! I return back to it often for reinforcement.
B000NA28IE|3.0|From reading other reviews, it seems pretty apparent that your enjoyment of this movie is linked to whether or not you have read the book. I haven't read the book, and enjoyed the movie well enough. <br /> <br />It is pretty much exactly what I was expecting, which is a big, dumb, splashy fantasy epic in the same league as Krull or Beastmaster. To compare it to Lord of the Rings is foolish: it has nowhere near that level of complexity. A better comparison would be Dragonslayer, with Dennis Quaid. There is not an original scene or character in the movie. If you've seen any fantasy, you can predict what will happen. In fact, if you've seen the original Star Wars (episode IV, for you purists), you've seen this movie: farm kids whose parents vanished mysteriously in being raised by his uncle. He finds he has special powers, and is tutored by an older mentor after his uncle is killed by bad guys. The main bad guy also has special powers. And on and on and on. Nothing new here. <br /> <br />That being said, if you have no expectations, this movie can be a lot of fun. John Malkovich chews the scenery, Jeremy Irons lends the movie some weight, the effects are good and the people are pretty. It moves along at a lightning pace. True, there are about a hundred plot points that are dropped, but it becomes apparent early on that the entire point of this flick is to have a sequel. I'm glad I saw this on DVD, rather than in a movie theater, and I expect it to become a cable staple for years to come. It's that kind of movie.
B000002U82|4.0|Wow, will I hear about this one!  I'm well aware of the legendary status this album has received over the years, and I do believe its' status is reasonably deserving.  I just feel a lot has been made of the technological advances this album clearly pioneered (thanks to Alan Parsons' amazing engineering job) and the reputation is less worthy when we size up the individual songs.  No, I'm not saying the songs are weak...because they surely aren't!!  But in my humble opinion, there are just isn't enough music to give it the legendary status it seems to have earned.  \\"Money\\" and \\"Us And Them\\" are amazing songs sonically,  but a bit wanting lyrically, bordering on preachy.  On the other hand, \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" are much more subtle and with the style of Waters' lyrics, the product works better when left as individual songs.  Moreover, the songs have a pop quality that had not been effectively matched to the style of progressive rock music before - and the marriage worked to perfection here.  And of course, there's David Gilmour's guitar playing.  Gilmour, in my view, matches a solo to the lyrics of a song better than any guitar player in rock history - and this album was the first real showcase for that aspect of his amazing talent.  He was always great, but the way he defined a song with his playing really emerged on \\"Dark Side\\".<br /><br />Waters' lyrics would develop unevenly - \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was a greater triumph in what it had to say, but he would regress to preachiness again in \\"Animals\\" before reaching his apex with \\"The Wall\\".  My feelings for this album remain mixed - sonically, it would have to be considered the crowning achievement of rock history.  The lyrics, though, just don't live up to the sound.  Maybe that's a small indictment of such a revered album;  but if Alan Parsons had not worked his engineering magic,  would the songs have been able to stand on their own and still be the classics they have become?  My feeling - for what's it worth - is they would not.<br /><br />Sonically - 6 stars.  Lyrics and Music - 3 stars.at's it worth - is they would not.  <br /> <br />Sonically - 6 stars.  Lyrics and Music - 3 stars.
B000062YAZ|5.0|wow...it took long enough to get here but when it did...it completely blew me away. this is among the greatest thrash metal albums of all time with Metallica-Master of Puppets and Megadeth-Rust In Piece and im sure Anthrax has a good thrash cd but i only own their greatist hits. ANYWAY...like previous reviewers have said this album doesnt let up...at all. this was the most brutal album of its time. now heavy metal bands cite this as their \\"holy bible\\". and if they dont, then theyre missing out. BUY THIS ALBUM EVEN IF YOUVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF SLAYER!!!although if u havent, then thats pretty sad. BUY THIS ALBUM EVEN IF YOUR JUST GETTING INTO METAL!!! its unrelenting and if u cant handle this album, then u should either  <br />a)get metallica-master of puppets as thats not as hardcore as this album <br />or b) admit that your just not destined to listen to thrash metal and try a different genre. <br />
0618680004|5.0|Richard covers a lot of ground in this book. And whatever views you may have, it should get you thinking. But it is hard to refute the major thrust of the argument, at least rationally. The idea of creating a god to fill in unknowns in our worldview, or provide comfort or any other reason, should not be held as a virture. Virture is more easily accomplished my honest seking for the truth. A truth that goes beyond 'wishful thinking' (whether that truth seeking involves science, personal reflection or something else). Read the book and form you own mind, but do read it
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Stallone had to thank his lucky stars Talia Shire declined to do this movie. If Adrian was still alive what would this film be about??? Rocky Balboa centers around Adrian's death and Rocky's inability to move on with his life. And the fact that Shire opted out of Rocky 6 dictated the direction of this film. <br /> <br />I recently watched Rocky 1-3 just so I could get back in the grove before I watched Rocky Balboa. And half way into RB I felt very let down. Why? This movie felt.... forced to me. It is no secret that Sly needed this film to work. Sylvester had not had a hit film in a long time. He financed this movie himself and had a lot riding on it. And I felt like he was trying too hard to make it perfect. The dialogue felt too neat and rehearsed. Paulie was annoying. Mason Dixson had no heat with Rocky. The feud, if you could call it that, had no edge. Now Rocky vs Clubber Lang... THAT WAS INTENSE. Balboa vs Dixson had no real intrigue to me. Dixson was not a bad guy or a mean guy. He didnt make you want to hate him. Which is important in a Rocky film. <br /> <br />The main event looked like a REAL fight. You could tell that it was filmed with the same cameras used to shoot sporting events. It was pretty impressive. But the fight felt nothing like the fights in other Rocky series. Creed, Lang, Drago, these fights had a special feel. They had drama and passion. Hard hits. Tension. These older fights WERE Rocky. The style and presentation of these great fights is gone from Rocky Balboa. The main even in this movie feels like a TV fight. I felt a little detached. Like I wasnt in the ring. I wasnt feeling the punches or the anger. I wasnt involved in the outcome. I didnt care who won or lost.  <br /> <br />The parts of the film that did work were the flashbacks. It was cool to see shots from the other movies intertwined with this film. I would have loved to see Mr. T or Dolph Lundgren make a cameo, but that did not happen.   <br /> <br />Im glad this movie was a success for Mr. Stallone, as he is one of the greats. But he could have done better. That is just my opinion.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Ridley Scott is an inconsistent director. He has had one overwhelming success (Gladiator), a few borderline successes (e.g., Black Hawk Down), and several cult successes (Alien and Thelma and Louise). The rest of his films, for the most part, have been disasters, including the now infamous Kingdom Of Heaven and the cult-film-wannabe Blade Runner. If you want to read everything that Ridley Scott is NOT, read his entry on Wikipedia.<br /><br />His decision-making in A GOOD YEAR is across the board. He shows brilliance in choosing cinematographer Phillippe Le Sourd, who won a Satellite Award for his vision of Provence in harvest season, with a gorgeous pallet of blues and oranges. But then he seems to have lost his mind in casting Russell Crowe in the lead, an extremely talented actor who has never shown any inclination toward comedy in any film he has ever done, and who, quite frankly, lacks the vulnerability and charm to pull it off. Crowe does his best to make self-absorbed stock trader Max Skinner interesting, but fails to make him funny even once, and pretty much fails to make him romantic, even though this is a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Again, Scott shows brilliance in choosing Marion Cotillard to play the love interest, Fanny Chenal; Abbie Cornish to play Christie Roberts, Max's only competition for his uncle's estate; Archie Panjabi to play Max's dry-witted assistant; Albert Finney to play Max's uncle; and Freddie Highmore to play the young Max Skinner. But then he makes strange choices in music that doesn't seem to fit the style of the film.<br /><br />With gorgeous photography, Russell Crowe's talent and an attractive location and cast, it's hard not to like this film. It's just hard to laugh and just as hard to get into the attempts at romance. There is very little at stake here, and so there is very little payoff. There is very little reason to care if Max makes the right choices. We care more for the women in the film than we do for Max. Do we really want to wish him on any of them? I guess scriptwriter Marc Klein, who based his screenplay on Peter Mayle's novel, could be blamed for this. But it's a lot more fun to blame Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithly want to wish him on any of them?

0345403959|4.0|I love it when the series is all done, and I can burn through it without having to wait for the next book to be written.  This was a very good book.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I liked this movie very much and especially enjoyed seeing Will Ferrell as something other than just another variety of buffoon.  Sure, he is good in those roles and quite funny, but here he takes the clown off and brings us a new range of character with his portrayal Harold Crick.<br /><br />Crick is an IRS auditor who lives a very precise and standardized life.  He seems oblivious to why he is doing this or that by living this way he is avoiding his life.  Underneath somewhere we do learn that he has some awareness of his condition and does have real human emotions about such awful tedium, but he has them bottle up in something like the containers used to transport nuclear waste.<br /><br />All this changes when he begins to hear a voice narrating his life.  This makes his routine very difficult.  His associates at the IRS notice the problem.  Oh, and the counselor at the IRS is Tom Hulce looking a lot like Richard Dreyfuss.  He gets what should be a simple auditing assignment to a very small bakery and meets a very antagonistic Ana Pascal (played by the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal).<br />After rejecting the recommendation of a psychiatrist to get medicated, he ends up seeking the help of a professor of literature, Jules Hilbert (in a fine performance by Dustin Hoffman).<br /><br />I don't want to go into any more of the plot because it is all about the voice and his life.  While some folks complain about plots that aren't naturalistic and other complain that Zach Helm is trying to rip off Charlie Kaufman, I don't think so.  Kaufman is too experimental to have a point as direct as is made in this movie.  And if you really just look at the story from a literary point of view, it makes complete sense.  Many literary critics, Harold Bloom for one, keep talking about how our lives are rooted in literature, that we are creations of great writers in the past whose world views we have adopted and merely suppose them to be our own sense of the world.<br /><br />Whether you accept this or not, it makes sense to wonder what a literary creation would think of his world if he could, wouldn't it?  And what that awareness would mean?se to wonder what a literary creation would think of his world if he could, wouldn't it?  And what that awareness would mean?

A story of a family  who struggles to live, not just survive.<br /><br />Jesse, an older brother who enjoys fire.  Kate, a teenager with a rare form of leukemia.  Anna, the sister who was brought into the world, by genetic design, to be an stem cell/organ donor for Kate.  Sara and Brian, the parents who live to make sure Kate lives.<br /><br />This book was written in the comforting style that Mrs. Picoult does so well; each chapters narrates a characters view of what is happening.  You hear everyone's thoughts, their voices, bringing a silent comfort that you actually know the characters.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  It is filled with joy, sadness.  It's topic is controversial (stem cell) and the ending shocked me to tears! -- Tears that envelope the message that ultimately, no matter what happens in life, life is so ultimately precious, to everyone.<br /><br />4.5 stars!

B000HWXS2S|4.0|All are words that could easily be used to describe the latest offering from Amon Amarth.  WITH ODEN ON OUR SIDE (Metal Blade, 2006) is nearly forty-three minutes of monumental melodic death metal.  Moving into a new studio and utilizing the talents of a fine producer (Jens Bogren - Opeth, Soilwork) proved worthwhile for the Viking warriors.  This record has a much more consistent feel than 2004's FATE OF NORNS or 2002's VERSUS THE WORLD.  Bogren's knob twisting adds a certain sheen to this record that makes it a must for headphone listening. <br /> <br />The album opens with the driving crusher \\"Valhall Awaits Me\\".  Johan Hegg's gravelly bellow is amazingly easy to understand and draws the listener into the unfolding battle.  The thunderous drums and amazing guitar tones had me reaching to up the volume before getting to the first chorus. <br /> <br />Other up-tempo highlights on this gem are \\"Asator\\", a straight up speedster that tips the horned-helmet to the band's Swedish death metal lineage, and \\"Runes to My Memory\\" a swift galloping ride into the next world. <br /> <br />  <br />\\"Hermod's Ride to Hel\\", \\"Cry of the Blackbirds\\", and the title track fall squarely into the AA hymns of majesty category.  Proud chants, all.  My favorite track, however, is \\"Gods of War Arise\\".  The storytelling is so articulate, so well done, that I actually catch myself hoping that the poor villagers about to be torn asunder die with dignity. <br /> <br />The ability to continually create meaningful, relevant music from the same set of overriding themes is one element that sets AA apart from pack.  Do yourself a favor and pick up one of the best sounding metal albums of 2006.
B00005JPMX|3.0|Roughly 14 years after their last big-screen appearance, everyone's favorite human-sized, buff turtles return in \\"TMNT\\".  Director Kevin Munroe made the interesting choice to make the film in CGI after no studio was interested in another life-action Ninja Turtles film (bummer).  CGI works well for the lean, green fighting machines, particularly in \\"TMNT\\", where the animation is fine-tuned to near perfection.  Also, as was Munroe's intent, the animation resembles the style of a comic book.  This is all great, except for one big flaw: CGI screams family, and in the case of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, family says \\"kids\\".    That's the biggest letdown of Munroe's movie: it's clearly aimed at a younger audience.  Which isn't to say that older audiences can't or won't enjoy it, but those fans expecting at long last a truly ferocious TMNT film should brace themselves to be let down.  Aside from the kid-friendliness of the movie, the only other downside is probably the storyline.  Munroe decided to do something different from this film, and that's okay, but it seems a little too over-the-top for a comeback film.  On the plus side, \\"TMNT\\" leaves an all-too-obvious hint that the Turtles' nemesis will return should this film warrant a sequel.  Which begs the question, does this film deserve a sequel?    Well, let's see - the voicing cast is pretty neat.  The Turtles' voices fit their personalities well.  The rest of the cast, which includes Patrick Stewart, Zhang Ziyi, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Smith (!), have almost instantly-recognizable voices which really add some interest to otherwise dull characters.  Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job voicing April, and Mako - oh, Mako, rest in peace - is a perfect fit as master Splinter, who steals the show in every one of his scenes.    Then there's the script.  It has some ridiculous one-liners, of course, clearly aimed at the kiddies, but there's some cool scenes and great lines (Splinter's interest in soaps?  Priceless!), and it's a perfect length.  In a live-action film the script would never do, but \\"TMNT\\"'s animation is superb enough to keep the film afloat no matter what.    So all in all, \\"TMNT\\" is an interesting and fun film, but it's target audience is too young to really appreciate it, and that fact that it's target audience is so young will leave most older fans feeling rather blue.  However, just because our sewer-dwelling heroes have returned, because of an all-star voice cast, and because of some really super animation, I'd recommend to \\"TMNT\\" to anyone familiar with the franchise.  It could be better, but face it - it could be a lot worse.

0345350472|5.0|This anti-robot novel is oft misunderstood by those who come to it with expectations formed by the pro-robot movie.  The novel is essentially a paranoid fantasy about machines which pretend to be people.  The pretense is so horrifyingly effective that a bounty hunter engaged in the entirely necessary task of rooting out and destroying these monsters finds that his own humanity has become imperiled.<br /><br />Originally entitled \\"DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP,\\" this novel was re-titled \\"BLADE RUNNER\\" to tie it to the Ridley Scott film loosely based on it. It remains available under either title (and with separate entries on AMAZON), but it is the same book. The film studio wanted to market a \\"novelization\\" of the film, but PKD adamantly refused to authorize this, forcing them to instead market his original novel under the film's title. Good move, Phil!<br /><br />This decision, however, has led to confusion and/or disappointment when readers approach the novel with expectations formed by the film. Many reviewers here (whether they like the book, the film, or both) have commented on how different they are. Few seem to realize, however, the extent that they are in direct and fundamental conflict.  Some praise the book for tearing down the distinction between man and machine or promoting other nihilistic views and pro-robot messages that the author would have found abhorent.  Others pan it for lack of focus in failing to promote the film's pro-robot agenda as effectively as the film did.<br /><br />That conflict may be summarized as follows: The book is anti-robot and pro-human, and seeks to uphold the distinction between robot and human, and between illusion and reality, in the face of a most-insidious challenge. The film was pro-robot and anti-human, promoting the idea that a compelling illusion is equivalent to reality, and that its ruthless robots were, if anything, better than humans.<br /><br />The book glorifies the common man for his basic decency -- specifically his capacity for basic empathy and compassion -- and deplores the robots for their complete lack of these qualities. In the book, even a \\"chickenhead\\" (a mentally retarded human mutant) is infinitely more valuable than the smartest robot. The film on the other hand, glorifies the robot as a sort of superman (\\"more human than human\\") -- stronger, faster, more beautiful, more intelligent, -- who seem poised to inherit the future on a dying Earth. The film even seems to admire the robots for their ruthlessness.<br /><br />The book makes Deckard (the protagonist) human, and loyal to humans. The film has Deckard switch sides and join the robots.  Indeed, in the film (not the book) Deckard may himself be a robot (the latter is never made explicit, but director has made clear it is what he intended).  This means that, in the FILM, there are virtually no sympathetic human characters -- those characters who suggest that a man is worth more than a computer program are portrayed as bigots.<br /><br />In PKD's view, the androids are unquestionably monsters who must be destroyed. The irony, and the central problem posed in the novel, is that their ability to SEEM human (which,, in the NOVEL, is never more than meticulously-programmed fakery), means that those who must destroy robots risk damage to their own humanity in the process. Thus, the author approves of Deckard's wife, whose sympathy for the \\"poor andys\\" is evidence of her humanity, while still approving of Deckard's assignment.<br /><br />In the novel, the robots' increased ability to fool the VK test is merely an advance in programmed mimicry of human test responses. The film, on the other hand, treats the improved performance on the VK test as evidence that the robots are truly \\"human\\".  But the film's robots do not demonstrate compassion in any meaningful way. The agenda of the film is NOT so mcuh to show that robots are as compassionate as humans, but rather to show that humans are as ruthless as robots (asevidenced, mainly, by their willingness to kill robots). This agenda is eerily similar to that of the TV androids near the end of the novel, who set out to expose human empathy as a myth.<br /><br />In the novel, the title question must be answered in the negative. Androids DON'T care about other creatures. It is humans who have the capacity care about other creatures -- ironically, even about androids -- even electric sheep.<br /><br />So many, even among the author's admirers, have missed the novel's true focus that it may be best to defend my interpretation with a quote from the author himself, made shortly before his death (quoted in the book \\"Future Noir\\"):<br /><br />\\"To me, the replicants are deplorable.  They are cruel, they are cold,<br />they are heartless.  They have no empathy, which is how the<br />Voight-Kampff test catches them out, and don't care about what happens<br />to other creatures.

B00005JPDS|4.0|<br />Sometimes it could be quite a \\"happi\\" exerience watching a warm family movie with kids in the cinema; and this is what I did today.   <br /> <br />I am not about to tell the story here again.  You can see other reviews for this.  Anyway, the Smith & Son had an excellent performance.  Can't remember whether Will Smith have done this kind of genre before.  I don't quite like Thandie Newton's acting as the wife (& mother) - a bit over-acting.  Not sure about the real life story - her charater in the movie is selfish, unreasonable and humiliating.  I think she could act a bit mellow being a loving mother of a young child. <br /> <br />The part that describes Will's struggling journey took it too long, so we could only see a brief 2 minutes of his \\"Happiness\\" at the end of the movie.  I can understand the Director's intention of building up the theme to the end, but I would do it differently if I am writing the script.   <br /> <br />I don't understand why a mistakenly spelling word (mentioned several times in the movie) \\"Happyness\\" is used as the movie title.  It is bad education to the public.  After all, Is it Joy or Happiness that we are searching for in life?  May be it's getting a bit philosophical...... <br /> <br />

B000N4SHPS|4.0|I had the same thought everyone else probably had when I heard there would be a new Rocky movie: \\"oh, I bet it will be total s...!\\" How can a movie be made about a 60 year old man wanting to box again?(excuse me, 59 year old man--a few years shaved off in the story I noticed).  I've always viewed the first 3 movies as one long movie: It went from Rocky being a nobody to the champ, to losing and back again and part 4 & 5 were some other Rocky, in another dimension.  The first 3 movies were great, the others not so much for me personally.  Truth is the new movie is a fitting end to the Rocky series.  I've always thought the last movie, made in 1990, was the worst of the entire series, a big mess, and it just seemed like an odd way to end Rocky's boxing career, with a bare fisted street fight in a rundown Philli neighborhood with a Don King-type looking on saying 'touch me and I'll sue'.  For most of Rocky Balboa the movie has a somewhat depressing tone -well not somewhat... it IS depressing- and Rocky seems to dwell on the past and his deceased wife Adrian who died of the 'woman cancer' 4 years earlier.  It almost becomes pitiful and excruciating watching Rocky's life until he decides to return to boxing.  But hence I think Stallone knew this as well when he wrote this.  The movie seems to work, at least to me.  The look Stallone gives as he is walking out of the ring after the fight at the end of the movie and waving to the crowd is very moving.  His expression is almost as if he's saying 'thank you' to the audience, both in the movie and the audience/fans watching the movie.  That little look says it all about why he made this movie and why he wanted to make the movie.  It's true the movie is pretty much nostalgia(the hat, the gloves, the old gray sweatpants, the old apt. stoop, the steps leading up to the museum, the old neighborhood haunts, the bar, Spider Ricco, the turtles, the pet shop, the ice rink, the meat factory Paulie works at, little Marie and unfortunately, the downing of raw eggs by Rocky) but it works.  It was nice to see Rocky come back although I truly hope this is the last Rocky movie.  I don't want to see Rocky entering the ring with a cane when he's 80 years old or nothing like that.  The making of on the DVD is very good too.  You get to see how wild the fans act as he's filming the movie in and around Philladelphia.  The world truly loves Rocky.  And for Rocky fans, take note: Stallone mentions on the audio commentary that there will be a diretor's cut of the movie.  Can you say double dipping? Great movie nonetheless.  At least part V won't be the last chapter to the Rocky series.  The look as he's leaving the arena(in the new movie) says it all.ely, the downing of raw eggs by Rocky) but it works.

Britney in a tight red suit, flames in the background, on the planet mars. Britney was so angelic and beautiful.<br /><br />When her next album came out featuring the sexually deviant, \\"Im a slave for you\\", I knew the Britney career was headed in the wrong direction. People fell in love with this Britney (the alleged virgin), not the bad and dirty Britney.<br /><br />I knew the Britney career was nothing more then a marketing ploy, but I ate it up anyway. She stood for youth, innocence, and all that was good.<br /><br />No matter what you think about her fake career, we should all hope that she gets better for her children. Britney was exploited and abused by the industry and media. The Britney we see today is a product of that exploitation. I hope she will be able to sort her life out.

B000002GJ7|3.0|Extreme really got a bum rap.  In the 80's, everyone shrugged them off as carbon copies of Van Halen.  In the 90's, they tried to make relevant concept albums.  ... And maybe had it not been for [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]], people would've actually listened to them.  ... But, alas, much like Def Leppard and the Crue and others who need not be mentioned, Extreme found their albums in bargain bins and basement boxes.  ... Because, let's face it; they weren't from Seattle. <br /> <br />If anyone ever took time to listen to their records in the early 90's, particularly [[ASIN:B000002GJ7 Extreme II: Pornograffitti]] and [[ASIN:B000002G0P III Sides to Every Story]], they're actually not that bad.  ... And listening to them in 2007, they're surprisingly not dated. <br /> <br />While conceptually the \\"fairy tale\\" of [[ASIN:B000002GJ7 Extreme II: Pornograffitti]] isn't as tight as it could have been, the album really shows Extreme leaping from arena hair metal into any genre you could imagine.  Yes, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt's solos are here, but they take a back seat in the horn-laden \\"Get the Funk Out\\" or the crooner throwback, \\"When I First Kissed You.\\"  Of course, the real highlights of this disc are the two hits, \\"Hole Hearted\\" and \\"More Than Words,\\" the latter showcasing one of the best acoustic guitar tones to this day. <br /> <br />So if you're looking for a throwback record that you can crank up in the Camaro on the way to your high school reunion, this probably isn't the record for you.  However, if you are looking for one of the more musically interesting and boundary-pushing albums of the hair-metal era, I definitely recommend this.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Thinking the movie could never be as good as the stage play, I only just saw this on HBO for the first time a few weeks ago.  Joel Schumacher was certainly the right choice for director - his casting, set design, etc. were superb.  I cried when the Phantom begged Christine to love him; how could anyone resist that sexy Gerry Butler, especially when he cries, too.  He wasn't all that disfigured, nothing like Michael Crawford's makeup - Yuck.  I must have watched both CDs 20 times at least by now.  Bought the CD of the movie soundtrack, too.  Went to see \\"300\\" with Gerry Butler - still exudes that same sexiness.  I am forever a fan - both of the movie and of G. Butler; in fact, I'm ordering a poster I saw on E-bay with Gerry and Emily Rossum - boy, can that kid sing!  I could listen to some singing by Gerry again, by the way.

B00005N6KG|4.0|My ears always hurt after using the in the ear headphone.  One day, I borrow my friend's vertical in-the-car headphone for quick sampling of music and want one immediately!  This one is light weight, stay in my ear, does not hurt after many hours and price is right (eek tech sells it for 1.99?! but with shipping is about the same price as Amazon.)  The only problem I found is the cord seem to be a bit short - I wish it was longer and is thinking of getting an extension cord
B000K4WLXA|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. The \\"script\\" wasn't what I expected and seems to have no real rhyme or reason. I can't follow it nearly as well as its Japanese counterpart which I already have. The postcards are cool and even though I already have the DVD, I don't mind a backup copy for gifts or such. I'm still thinking about the \\"story\\" about Tifa and Denzel and Barret though. It seems like a pourly written fanfiction explaining these characters' actions just before Advent Children begins. I must confess, I would have liked more on Cloud dealing with his geostigma instead.
1582701709|1.0|I think this is a dangerous book because it has some truths mixed with lies and witchcraft.  Newsweek recently ran an article about the book [...].    The author literally believes that you just concentrate your thoughts and you can have whatever you want without having to do any other actions.  That's ludicrous!
B00005JPMC|4.0|Lots of things go Boom, heads explode as well as roll in Antoine Fuqua's (the terrific \\"Training Day\\" and the effective \\"Tears of the Sun\\") on the one hand thoroughly reprehensible yet on the other, totally satisfying entertainment, \\"Shooter,\\" starring Mark Wahlberg as a psychically wounded former military sniper, Bob Lee Swagger licking his wounds in a back woods cabin attempting to forget his time in the Marines.<br />Then Swagger is pulled back into his old life of high powered, long range rifles and into a higher powered, full of intrigue Presidential assassination plot that of course goes awry.<br />Wahlberg, formerly of the jeans at the hips fame who has successfully moved away from teen heart throb to excellent actor, has been very effective in films particularly in \\"The Departed\\" and \\"The Yards,\\" a very under-rated film with Charlie Theron, directed by James Gray. As Swagger, Walhberg exhibits real screen credibility and weight. His performance is committed and human. Also making a good impression is Kate Mara as a steel butterfly-type woman: beautiful but as deadly at home at the stove as she is with a rifle.<br />Fuqua proves once again that he is a great director of action and this film is big, bold and noisy: explosions and gun battles abound. But Fuqua is also a great director of actors: Denzel's towering performance in \\"Training Day\\" and Walberg and Kate Mara in this film.<br />Though loud and obnoxious at times, there is definitely an intellect at work here and \\"Shooter\\" is never crass and manipulative though its origins can be traced back to the bizarre juxtaposition of both \\"JFK\\" (it is no coincidence that Wahlberg's character's name is very similar to Lee Harvey Oswald) and \\"Rambo.\\" Now there's a combo.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The young son of a cabinet-maker(Edward Norton) becomes acquainted with Sophie, the daughter of a wealthy man for whom his father works.  They are inseparable until their parents decide that their friendship is unsuitable and they forbid them to see each other.  The young man travels the world and learns the art of being an illusionist, while the young girl grows up and is to be betrothed to the Crown Prince of Austria.  They meet again and discover that their attraction is as strong as ever, but they are threatened by the cruel Crown Prince who has no intention of letting Sophie go.  This is an exquisite movie in every way.  It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully written, and well-acted.  There are moral questions, particularly with regard to the Chief Inspector who is under the wing of the Crown Prince, and questions as to how the illusions in the movie are done.  Rather than detracting from the film, all of this creates a perfect mood and setting for a highly entertaining movie.
B00005JPMC|2.0|if compares to the original fascinating 'point of impact' by stephen hunter, this 'shooter' is a failure, not just the screenplay but also the hero casting. m.w,'s image is totally different from what we have visualized 'bob lee swagger' should be. even you didn't read the first 'swagger' series, you would not feel thrilled by the choice of m.w., because he's absolutely not 'swagger' should look like and act like. added up by a somewhat messy screenplay and other badly casting supporting roles, this movie is a far-cry from what we wish to be produced. i was kinda heart-broken when i found out that the great series was totally ruined by this mediocre movie and those hollywood stereotyped explosions. better check with the marines to see if they know how to get ready-made stuff from a hardware store to make pipe bombs so powerful. i seem to remember that 'point of impact' is a very lethal but also very quiet novel, where those explosions come from?
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|You will probably never hear a more diverse and consistently brilliant Hits collection than this tour de force from Peter Gabriel. Most of his best known songs (not all, alas) are here:  Biko, Don't give up, Steam, Solisbry Hill, Games without frontiers, Sledgehammer etc are all on Disc 1 which is subtitled: HIT.  But it is Disc 2, subtitled MISS that is more rewarding as it showcases songs like Rhythm of the Heat, Family Snapshot, Cloudless, Downside Up, Father Son and San Jacinto.  Two new tracks are BURN YOU UP BURN YOU DOWN (good funky stuff!) and CLOUDLESS (sublime reworking of the song SKY BLUE featuring vocals from the Blind Boys From Alabama)    There are always songs you would like to see on a Hits package and some that could be jettisoned and this album is no exception.  I cannot understand why SHAKING THE TREE is not included.  This is a song he co-wrote with Youssou N'Dour and there is a remastered version on his earlier hits album, also called Shaking The tree.  It is a wonderful song in praise of Women with a gentle voal by Gabriel.  Must be a legal reason or maybe a falling out with Youssou. One of his classic songs: IN YOUR EYES is buried on the MISS side and that is on the USA version.  It is not even included on the European version.  That is an amazing oversight.  Also songs like LOVE TO BE LOVED from US is reather boring and does not belong here.  He could have included from the same album, KISS THAT FROG,  COME TALK TO ME or SECRET WORLD, especially the live version which way surpasses the studio version.  Also SKY BLUE or an edited version of THE BARRY WILLIAMS SHOW  from UP might have been a better selection than I GRIEVE.  It would have been great to merge SKY BLUE and CLOUDLESS together for one magnificent closing track. The really weird THE TOWER THAT ATE PEOPLE, LOVETOWN and THE DROP could also have been left off so earlier PG material could have been presented. INTRUDER is not included and nothing from Peter Gabriel 2, although DIY is onthe European version as is NO SELF CONTROL and I HAVE THE TOUCH. There are cut versions of some songs which actually help in the case of BLOOD OF EDEN, GROWING UP and MORE THAN THIS. Maybe STEAM could have been edited also as it is on the long side. Hopefully an anthology is on the way to encompass all relevant Peter Gabriel tracks.
0307237699|4.0|I wasn't expecting a whole lot from The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama.  I thought it would be a lengthy stump speech, worth knowing but no revelations. What I found, however was a thoughtful plan, mapping out a direction for restoring common sense into the political process.  Obama is a well-spoken, well-written, humble man who really knows how to articulate a message. He uses personal anecdote, history, Constitutional interpretation, and a healthy respect for the expertise of others in building a cohesive platform for success.  Were it delivered consistently as well as he delivered his prose in this books, it would be the basis for repairing many of the rifts in the political landscape torn apart by extremism.<br /><br />What really impressed me about his ideas was the respect he showed to the opposition.  The book lacked the vitriol common to today's political discussion, more rightly called bucks in rut.  He recognizes that most people don't live, eat, breath, and bleed politics.  Most people have families and jobs and lives to live.  Most people have dozens of important issues that are important to them and aren't nearly as extremist in their views as our dichotomous news media would have us believe.  People want the opportunity for comfort, education, success, security, and happiness.  Obama knows this and writes eloquently about it - it's not us vs. them, but it's us trying to succeed together.<br /><br />His positions are clear - protect American jobs, regulate for safety with a mind toward capitalistic growth, health care for all, and a strong education system.  He describes the process by which Republicans framed the debate, usurping issues and positions, claiming them as their own.  He shows how this is false and declares the need to reclaim those arenas of discourse that Democrats have been thrust away from in public opinion.  Democrats can be men of faith, most believe in God, most are Christians.  Democrats are hard working motivated individuals and business owners who believe in a strong capitalist economic system so long as protections against abuses are in place.  Democrats understand the need for both petroleum and petroleum alternatives and aren't trying to thrust us back into the 1800's.<br /><br />He's right in this book and I'd have given him all five stars if there'd have been more passion in the words, more commitment to the change processes, and more leadership.  Perhaps if he becomes president and afterward writes a memoir he'll speak of those passions and commitments more freely.<br /><br /> - CV Rickand business owners who believe in a strong capitalist economic system so long as protections against abuses are in place.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|I can see this movie is trying to sell to some people (e.g. Bush and Fox News lovers), but I am disappointed by the cheap, silly story line and new 007 which has turned the sophisticated and gentleman old 007 into a monster who loves killing people and violence just for the sake of it. This movie seems to try to make it look cool to kill every terrorist instead of bring them to court, blow up other country's embassy, wasting millions of dollars on the way (\\"do we look like we need the money?\\"). This will influence young and uneducated viewers to approve the current US foreign policy. The ending is also appalling, it's like a statement saying, money is worth more than anything.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Even though I'm only 25, I grew up listening to Michael Jackson. I was singing, twirling & grabbing my crotch like him when I was 10 years old. As I got older, my musical tastes shifted and my once beloved MJ cd/casettes started to gather dust.  <br /> <br />Flash forward to a few days ago! I came across this CD and I KNEW I had to have it. It had been YEARS since I listened to the Michael Jackson classics and I just knew that this CD would make my day ;) I was growing tired of today's radio hits, but how can anyone get enough of Michael?  <br /> <br />I loved hearing the Jackson 5's ABC & I Want You Back. Even though I'm not from that time, I still enjoyed Michael's earlier stuff. I also liked hearing Blame It On The Boogie, Shake Your Body Down To The Ground and Off The Wall. These are all GREAT tap your toe songs! The song, Can You Feel It, is also one of the many gems on this cd. Of course, many hit songs from the albums Thriller & Bad are also included. Many MJ compilations contain the same songs (Beat It, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man In The Mirror) but it is refreshing to ALSO hear Dirty Diana, Leave Me Alone and Smooth Criminal. We are also treated to hear the lost hits from Michael's Dangerous album, including In The Closet, Who Is It and Dangerous (the album's exiting track). I feel bad, but I usually skip You Are Not Alone & You Rock My World. Those songs are only \\"Ho Hum\\" to me.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a wonderful CD. I've been listening to it in my car for 3 straight days. If you don't have any of your old MJ albums anymore, this is the CD to buy to have all the hits again.
B00004S8X5|5.0|I've been a Kylie fan since the early Neighbours' days and this was my first ever album on vinyl. I saw it here on CD and I had to buy it!! Sounds great in the car and the songs are very reflective of my own experiences so it's nice to know there's someone out there who can put it all into a song and make circumstances seem less painful than what they really are!
B00000K29E|5.0|For those who do not already know this album, let me first echo a few of the caveats made by some of the other reviewers: 1) This being Big Brother's first album, made before the Monterey Pop Festival and thus before they, and most especially Janis, hit international stardom, it lacks the developed sound and careful production of Cheap Thrills.  2) Janis sings lead not on every song, but on every second track. 3) A number of the tunes must be taken for what they are: goofy, experimental forays by an inspired group of talented hippie-musicians who were still in the process of discovering what it is that they do best and in so doing developing a unique artistic identity.  As such, songs like \\"Light is Faster Than Sound\\" and \\"Caterpillar\\" (one could add to this list \\"Harry\\" and \\"Gutra's Garden,\\" both of similar ilk found not on this album but on Big Brother live collections) would never have made it onto an album with a more commercially-saavy producer, yet they reveal some of the competing--and fun--elements that were in the Big Brother mix from the beginning. <br /> <br />With those caveats in mind, this album is nevertheless a jewel, expecially when one considers how precious little material exists from Janis's greatest period, the mere two-and-a-half years she spent with Big Brother.  Janis's voice here is higher, clearer, and more piercing than the raspiness of her Cheap Thrills period; it and the music have not yet found their way to the hugeness of drama, dissonance and pain that mark that second album.   <br /> <br />But the voice and the sound on this album have their own special appeal.  Songs like \\"Women is Losers,\\" \\"Intruder,\\" \\"Bye, Bye, Baby,\\" \\"Down on Me\\" display a startlingly original talent, a voice with a phrasing and tone and force of conviction that leaps out at the listener with an urgency that is unlike any other.   <br /> <br />Finally, a note to those who may already own the original vinyl edition of this album and therefore question whether theyneed another copy: The original issue and many of the subsequent re-issues did not contain the song \\"The Last Time,\\" which was the B-side of a single.  This song, written entirely (music and lyrics) by Janis, is astonishing.  For me, hearing it for the first time only a few years ago, it was as though I had traveled back in time or Janis had traveled forward into the present and I was hearing Janis's incendiary being in all its searingly defiant nakedness and immediacy.  It's at moments like these that I can't help but recall the words Janis sings in \\"Flower in the Sun\\":   <br />\\"I see you looking up at the sky  <br />(Oh, how high it is) -- <br />You wonder if there is another me --  <br />Oh, how can there be?  How can there be?\\"
1582701709|1.0|This is a rehash of a subject approached many times by people better than this. It is a very well engineered piece of marketing genius to squeeze max dollars from the hopeful. <br /> <br />While this will undoubtedly bring a fleeting moment of progress and hope to many people, it has no staying power. It is only a small part of what is required to succeed and it is not nearly as simplistic as this. Olympic Athletes, business leaders, and happy successful people everywhere know that doing well is more than just wishing and visualizing. While visualization is one of the most powerful human abilities, success requires a more holistic approach.  <br /> <br />The finest book on the way to succeed in life is not new but it is tested. Brian Tracy has written many books but MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT is by far the best book on this subject.  <br /> <br />A friend gave it to me years ago and I have since passed out a dozen copies over the years. <br /> <br />It is a far more complete look at being a successful human from compassion, personal responsibility, planning, goal setting, diet, exercise, meditation and many more laws than just this one such as:  <br /> <br />The 7 Laws of Mental Mastery: law of control, law of cause and effect, law of reciprocity, law of expectation, law of belief, law of correspondence and yes, law of attraction. I have read it many times and each time I get more. <br /> <br />Brian Tracy deserves all that he has made as he worked hard for decades and did not sell out to an overhyped charade. From a troubled kid and haphazard adult into a highly successful man. This is the REAL DEAL. <br /> <br />Read Maximum Achievement instead. <br /> <br />[[ASIN:0684803313 Maximum Achievement: Strategies and Skills That Will Unlock Your Hidden Powers to Succeed]]

B00003CX8U|4.0|The film is appearantly a loose auto-biographical account of the film's director Bob Fosse (Cabaret, Chicago, Star 80). A scrutinizing look at obsession leading to self destruction and finally the transference of pain to others. The film has too many technical high points to mention. Choreography goes without mention and has been mimicked by modern artists, sometimes blatantly. The screenplay is complex enough to be interesting but remains in the realm of 'easily digestible.'
B000MZHW40|3.0|BLOOD DIAMOND is an extremely important film from the informational standpoint.Going as far back as the early 1800's white Europeans and native blacks from various tribes have been complicit in the raping and pillaging of the  land and it's people in Sierra Leone.Not only has there been the Belgian Colonial Rule in the past,but also there has been a savage Civil War that has existed among the numerous indigenous people.Innocent people have been caught in the crossfire over the years.(NOTE: this is the land from which the AMISTAD slaves were sold!)Flash forward and it is 1999, and Sierra Leone is still in the midst of chaos,but this time it is for the mining of illegal diamonds that are smuggled into Liberia and make their way to an important diamond merchant,Van de Kamp.Danny Archer( the always \\"give-it-your-all Di Caprio) is the mercenary diamond smuggler;Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is the journalist who wants to blow the smuggling  story wide open!;and Solomon Vendy (always amazing Djimon Hounsou)who is the innocent native who is captured by warring rebels.It is Vendy who has found the illusive 100-karat \\"pink diamond\\".All of these characters converge in a superb action-filled,swiftly paced race to \\"exploit\\" each other in some way;Archer wants the diamond;Bowen wants the story and Vendy wants his family back.The Thomas Newton Howard soundtrack is absolutely riveting as well as the excellent cinematography and smart editing. <br />Where this film fails is in the inane dialogue.This is particularly true of the drek that is given to DiCaprio and Connelly.Two actors of such calibre deseved better than this.They do their best with it,but bad dialogue is bad dialogue! The story is terribly formulaic and a bit trite,and when everyone in Sierra Leone is getting killed,these characters always escape harm (of course they have to or the movie would have ended at the opening credits!).The film is just shy of three hours and much could have hit the cutting room floor.(I couldn't help noting that people in the audience began to fidget at the two-hour mark-I and my friends included!!!) <br />Where this film succeeds is in the information that the viewer gains about the continuing exploitation of the Africas and the civil unrest that exists among it's own people. <br />There is an excellent warning at the conclusion of the film for anyone who might be considering purchasing diamonds. <br />All-in-all,not a bad flick,but not a great one either.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen all the adaptations of this classic Gothic novel, and I must say that while there are always things I wish were closer to the book, this version does not disappoint.  The casting is wonderful.  The casting director managed to resist the temptation to put \\"beautiful\\" people into these roles, and rather cast actors whose strength of character made them more attractive the longer one watched.  The acting is very strong, and the adaptation [while it does cheat the beginning of Jane's life] is one of the few that finishes closer to the book than any of the others I have seen.  I highly recommend this Masterpiece Theatre \\"new\\" classic to all who enjoy Bronte's book.

B00005V9IJ|4.0|A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties.  <br />Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!  <br />In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
0743454537|4.0|I agree with many others that this book is indeed a page-turner. It is very easy to read, and from the first page, grabs you. The problem I had was with the characters; Picoult drew them out to an extent, but stopped developing them as unique individuals. Anna, the sister who was conceived to help heal her sister, what do we know about her, really? Did she hate her Mom? Did she feel betrayed? Was she a rebel; a 'good girl'; fearful; fearless?, etc.  <br />Was she not concerned about get \\"banged up\\" playing hockey, because she had had to develop a 'thick skin' when she got 'banged up' giving her sister her blood cells, etc? <br />I never really learned her main character traits.  <br />And, unfortunately, this goes for the rest of the characters, as well. Brian, the Dad, what do we know about him besides that he's a firefighter and loves astronomy? I could go on, and on, but you catch my drift. Instead of spending her time developing these characters, Picoult lays out (usually at the end of a chapter) a beautiful, lyrical, \\"account\\" about some character's dream, or a memory, etc. They are beautiful to read, but I was getting so tired of them by the end of the book. She did this so predictably & frequently that they really did not \\"stand out\\" like they would have if used more rarely, and with greater deliberation. <br />By the way, I agree with one of the reviewers that I really liked the lawyer. Picoult actually developed his character more than the others, and it makes the book far more worthwhile.  <br />All-in-all, a good read, with an excellent plot, but \\"light\\".

B00005JLSE|4.0|I love \\"Chicago\\". How do I know that? I've seen it twice in the theater, the friend of mine downloaded it for me from the Internet, and gave me CDs for my b-day, and I bought a DVD when it finally became available.<br /><br />Well, it may not be nearly as perfect as the Broadway revival - the plot, the cinematography, and the chronologically incorrect details - but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.<br /><br />First of all, Chicago did not take itself too seriously - there are a lot of details that were reused from Bob Fosse's himself (the All That Jazz number was done like an opening scene in Cabaret, Velma's playing with the chair in I Can't Co It Alone - also). Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's \\"Makin' Whoopee\\" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing; it was a very good acting. And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms - and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: \\"Objection!\\" - ADA Harrison:\\"But Your Honor, I have not even asked any question\\"!).<br /><br />Second, \\"Chicago\\" surprised me. I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it. With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of \\"All That Jazz\\" , Katherine Zeta-Jones just blew me away - the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it. She was born to play Velma. When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing - I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them - which is important, right? The following scenes were as delightful as the opening - Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to? My personal favorite was: \\"He was crazy, and he kept on screaming, \\"You've been screwing the milkman.\\" And then he ran into my knife... he ran into my knife ten times.\\"<br /><br />The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number - it actually showed in those three-four minutes the sadness and loneliness of a small man, maybe not very bright but decent and devoted one. The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in \\"Chicago\\" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.<br /><br />With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.<br /><br />4.5/5on, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to?

The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in \\"Chicago\\" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.  <br /> <br />With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again. <br /> <br />4.5/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0008ENHTE|5.0|I have read some of the reviews and what is with all the plot and history stuff. <br /> <br />Maybe short on plot, a little confusing, but a great action film for its time. <br /> <br />No CGI, no fake this or fake that. I later read that they went through several cars to complete the scenes, but it was real or as real as it could be.   No green scenes. <br /> <br />This is a movie from the era where muscle cars were being made and Detroit Heavy Metal was King.  The Heavy Metal was wrapped with a plain jane body, but there were guts there.  Like Steve McQueen. <br /> <br />Maybe I am recalling the visceral feelings I got from watching the movie. <br /> <br />It was Fall in the outskirts of Tacoma Washington at one of several Drive-Ins, and the movie started around 10 - 10:30 on a Friday night.  It was damp and there was a low fog that had rolled in.  My date and I were in a Fastback Mustang that had a small V-8, we very were close to Screen having arrived late - so the whole movie filled our field of vision.  In the chase scenes in the hills of SF, it felt like we were right there in the vehicle.  To this date I still can feel my stomach going up and down. <br /> <br />So get the movie, turn down the lights, turn off the cells, unplug the phones and watch the movie on the largest screen possible and as close as possible.  Recreate a movie making era and experience that does not exist today and could not be recreated today.  Enjoy actors just entering their craft.  Do not over-analyze it. <br /> <br /> <br />Enjoy it for its rawness and utter power. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Going against the harshest of critics and fans, Daniel Craig becomes the 6th James Bond, and passes with flying colors. Many people have had to eat their words. This Bond is tougher, leaner, and can be deadlier when need be. Some people complain(among many other hilarious things if you look at other reviews) that the charm and swagger isn't there. Not in abundance with Bonds past, no nor does it absolutely need to be, but it is there. The film, and Craig, breathe new life into the franchise, which was already doing just fine with Brosnan(who I still like better). It's a little grittier, and there is some old school Bond involved here. The story?. Pretty good. Starting from the beginning when Bond became a double O agent, he goes against evil villain Le Chiffre(Mads Mikkelsen), in a high stakes poker game, to thwart him from funding more terrorist acts. Fun premise. A big part of the Bond films is the villain. Mads Mikkelsen is unique and interesting looking. He has the presence, and has the right, classic evil Bond guy look. He weeps blood from his disfigured eye. The villain is handled a bit differently in the end than in most other Bond films. One of the better Bond villains in a good long while. The female is Vesper Lynd(Eva Green), and the ensuing romance, while good for showing Bond in a more human, relatable light, does bog the film down towards the end. It feels like it could of been done away with. The character is appealing, but it adds up to just being another Bond girl, really. Eva, however, is exceptionally lovely. Judi Dench is back as M, and the film just works. The first half is exceptionally good, with Bond being set up as an agent, and his relationship with M. The first big action/chase scene is quite something, as is the airport scene. Things slow down a bit in the second half from the first half, but the locations, Craig's Bond, and overall tone of the film save it. The end action climax is thrilling. The film also boasts a great tune. Chris Cornell's \\"You Know My Name\\" is rocking and modern, with a touch of old school Bond theme signatures. Makes you forget all about Madonna's uninspired Bond theme. It all comes back to Craig, though. He doesn't seem like Bond at first, but he definitley does as the film rolls along. He has a strong, undeniable presence, and you believe him in everything that he does in the film. The filmmakers are also aware of Craig's more buff physique, as it is on display a number of times throughtout the movie. In the end, Casino Royale is a wonderfully put together and directed Bond film. It has classic-retro Bond touches here and there, and really sets up a sparkling new life on the 44 year old series. As for extras, it's a bit slight, compared to DAD and other Bond films. The Bond Girl featurette is the best of the bunch. The film does feel to be a tad bit too long and goes on another 20 minutes or so when it feels like it should of already been over. Craig is not Connery, but he doesn't need to be. He is the Bond of today. Nobody still does it better than Bond.
B000J10EQU|3.0|I inserted my disc and was like, \\"where's the features?\\"  I didn't know that one had to buy the 2-disc special edition for the features.  I was rather disappointed because I wanted to see some sort of tribute to Christopher Reeves or something.  DVDs are too pricey to just have the movies on them.  Anyway, it's a really good movie.  Brandon Routh does a good job of playing Christopher Reeves playing Superman.  I wonder if he really studied the Superman movies of the 70s and 80s.  He really did the part justice.  As for Kate Bosworth as Lois, she did a fair job, but Margot Kidder made a better Lois.  Still, it's a really good movie; a fitting sequel to Superman 1 and 2 (let's all forget that 3 and 4 ever happened).
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was great and for a moment you forget they are actors and felt you are watching real lives. Di caprio and Nicholson performances were flawless, I don't like Matt Damon that much, because the only role that fits him is Bourne,he is so inexpressive that kinda get boring after a while. <br />I would give the movie 5 starts but we watched in a group of 10 people, and only 4 of them were delighted, the rest was like 'Its OK' <br />The HDDVD version is beautiful but there's ot much in the FX department to really tak advantage of the HD goodies. <br />Its a worth buying Mafia film!!
B000000OAL|2.0|I am a HUGE Queen fan, know that right off. However, if it weren't for Keep Yourself Alive, Doin' Alright, The Night Comes Down, I wouldn't even own this. This is on a par with Hot Space, in my opinion. My Fairy King (come oooon, Freddie!), Son and Daughter, Great King Rat (cool title, corny lyrics--AND I LIKE CORNY LYRICS!!), and perhaps the WORST SONG EVER RECORDED IN MODERN HISTORY, Jesus (with the exception of Starship's \\"We Built This City\\").  <br />They got better with QUEEN II (thank the good lord!), peaked with A Night At The Opera and News Of The World, attained global domination with The Game, lost all credibility with Hot Space, went all new-wavey with The Works, then regained my respect with Innuendo (especially the fabulous cover art), then Freddie died and it was...over. <br />But there are always their albums to keep me company. Just not Queen I. <br />
0743454537|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible. Being extrememly liberal I was intriuged at the idea of this sort of case playing out in a novel. Many people may critizice the ending... but I believe it holds with the tone of the book. This wasnt a light a cheery novel, and the impact of the ending really brings home her point.<br /><br />Told from the view of 6 characters, its easy to feel like the reader is going off track... especially when shifting from Sara's flashbacks to Jesse's deep fight within himself.<br /><br />Picoult manages to keep you 100% hooked in this story. The turns are unpredictable, shocking, and facsinating. All through-out the novel mini stories swirl around the main theme, which is very much like real life. There are always many sides to a story, many backgrounds to a situation... this novel brings those out really well.<br /><br />Incredible novel.<br /><br />I high reccomend it to those who enjoy the deep and controversial.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|After 16 years, Sylvester Stallone has accomplished what many figured would never happen. He came back with a new Rocky movie, and he came back with a really GOOD Rocky movie. Not only does Rocky still have punches in him, but so does Stallone. As a fan of the series, I can safely say that this is the best entry since the original. Quickly, the plot sees Rock running his own restaraunt, Adrian's, named after his deceased wife(Talia Shire is missed, but it works, and Shire herself says she trusts and believes in Sly with this twist in the story), and he doesn't have a strong relationship with his son(Milo Ventamiglia). A virtual reality boxing match on TV pitting him against Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon(Antonio Carver)has Rocky defeating him, and setting up a real life match with Rocky coming out of retirement for one last match. It's an interesting premise, really, and it works. Some may think it takes too long to get going or to get to the action, but that's why it works. It's not just about action and boxing, but about the people and the character of Rocky. That's why I like it. I am just as interested, if not more, in the non-boxing aspects of the movie. The best thing about the Rocky films is that each one finds the Italian Stallion in a new part of his life and takes it from there. He's older now, and the film doesn't overlook it just for Rocky and Sly to have another shot at glory. It's about age. It's a big part of the film. That's one of the great things about the film. They are not overlooking reality and age just to make another film. I hear the same thing is being done for Indy 4. The flashback scenes are scarce(although others say otherwise), and the \\"tour\\" of the old haunts is nostalgic, affective, and well placed. This film feels like a Rocky film, and has a sense of the original film. Little Marie(Geraldine Hughes) is back, as well as Spider, and this leads to the film's closer touch to the classic original. Burt Young's Paulie is still Paulie, and it wouldseem out of place to have a Rocky movie without him. The movie is surprisingly real, emotional, and heartfelt. You can't help but get caught up in the situation and cheer Rock on one last time. The end match is great, and feels like the real deal. It's exceptionally planned out and set up, and makes the tension feel real as you watch it. Bill Conti's theme is back, and it still raises goosebumps when it starts up. Sly isn't the greatest actor, but he is Rocky, and he knows Rocky, and he is really good in the film, as well as behind the camera as a director. Rocky V had it's moments, but it was not the film to end on. This one is. It fits wonderfully, and it wraps it up perfectly. To see the love and respect Rocky gets from people, especially in the end, is heartwarming. It doesn't fail to bring a lump to your throat. To matter how old you get, or where your life takes you, Rocky Balboa tells you to never give up. Thanks for coming back with Rocky one more time Sly. You made a truly wonderful film for this iconic character and series to go out on.

One is my personal copy, one to loan out to friends and family, and one as a gift to the school district I grew up in.  <br />I'm mildly disappointed in the frequent use of \\"the child with Asperger's\\" in reference to situations that affect both children and adults, although the latter portions of the book more frequently use \\"child or adult\\". <br />I've used one section of the book to explain to my church elders why I have such a difficult time dressing up, and look forward to being able to explain many more of my eccentricities with this tool. <br /> <br />-Sam Corbin
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Wait till you see this movie!  It's all about Al! How anyone can be so vain is beyond me, but this has always been Al's specialty. It's almost nauseating.  This poor man is still so bitter over the vote in Florida, he's still throwing tantrums. It's Pitiful.  As you'll see, all this film is, is a pathetic expose' on the disappointing life of Al Gore, with a lot of scientific exaggeration in the middle.  But what bothered me most, is how he preaches his anti-American hate all over the world by proclaiming \\"America is by far the worst contributor of all to the global warming problem.\\"  No one is saying the planet isn't warming up a little Al, but I for one, am not going to be led like a blind sheep over the falls. You can blame Solar flares, you can blame overpopulation, but to blame this country for something you can't even prove, is flat out irresponsible. Thank God this lunatic never made it to the Presidency. Al, you've earned your place in history with all the other dissidents, such as Sean Penn, the Dixie Chicks, and your ever so beloved... Bill Clinton.  Come on Al..... Stop your Global Whining.....ah, but I forget... \\"It's all about you isn't it.\\"

B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|After many years of toil, Nightwish finally accrued the funds, credibility and artistic experience necessary to produce the kind of album that defines a genre: \\"Once\\" is the ultimate symphonic-metal experience and a must for any Nightwish fan. Toumas' genius has never been more extant and Tarja's voice has never sounded better than it does here. With a full symphony orchestra backing the band on most tracks, this disc explodes with awesome sound; Nordic rock fans-- You are home!    The stand-out track on \\"Once\\" is \\"Nemo,\\" which alludes more to Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" than it does to either Jules Verne or the Disney fish. The song is haunting, rich and extremely memorable-- It almost has a concert feel to it. By far the mangnum opus of Nightwish.    Other favorites include (but are by no means limited to) \\"Planet Hell\\" (wonderfully operatic and provocative), \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" (sexy and cool), \\"The Siren,\\" and \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" (which takes an unexpected look at the demise of the North American indigenous peoples at the hands of white settlers; not really something one would expect from a Finnish band...), all of which capture the sheer awesomeness of Nightwish.     This album is definitely the capstone of the Tarja-era, though its true prodigy is far-and-away Toumas, whose musical gift shines through brighter than it ever has before. Absolutely recommended to both new and longtime Nightwish fans, or fans of symphonic-metal in general.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This darkly comic yet compelling BDSM-light relationship is blessed with great performances by Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.  The script is well-written; little personal moments in the film are beautifully shot, and the actors really find the soul of the characters they portray. <br /> <br />At its heart, it's really a sweet (if slightly disturbing) romance where one person's *unique* need for control meets up beautifully with someone else's *unique* need to submit. <br /> <br />Sexy?  YES.  Disturbing?  A LITTLE.  Worth watching?  ABSOLUTELY. <br /> <br />If you like unusual films, odd love stories, and quirky characters, this is a must-see.
0374105235|4.0|Although the continuity was sometimes uneven, this is a tale that needs to be told, heard, read. It was riveting and, at times, revoltingly honest. Beah's ability to rise above the horror that drug him to the depths of depravity conveys hope for humanity. He is a remarkable human being. I hope he continues to write. He has a gift for story telling that will improve with practice.
1400034779|5.0|It's hard to explain this series to someone.  I just tell them it's about life and understanding people and their behavior, which Precious does instinctually.  She's a thoughtful, caring, discerning individual and the reader can't help but fall in love with her.  The most wonderful thing about this book and the series, besides being a great read, is that anyone can read it from youth to adults of any age.  There's something there for everyone.  Hats off to Alexander McCall Smith for writing something that stretches across such a wide audience.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Many people say that this was the best album of the year, and I have to agree with that. Blood mountain is basically a non stop assault for all senses, just the opening drum beats are enough to send chills down your spine, and that's just the first 2 seconds. Brann Dailor just went insane on the drums, his technicality is phenomenal using speed and great technique that literally never stops. The dual axe men Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher shine more on this album, they  have great riffs and great solos and even offer up some great melodic lines in many songs. Troy Sanders bass sounds better this time with many jazz style bass lines and rumbleling bass. He actually even stepped up on his vocals too, going from loud grunts to even some melodic vocals. I'm not going to bore you with what I thought of the songs because you really need to listen to this album from start to finish but my favorite tracks have to include The Wolf is Loose, Crystal Skull, capillarian Crest,Circle of Cysquatch,Colony of Birchmen and Hand of Stone.

B000089RVX|5.0|For those of us who loved Evanescence before their studio debut, we were unsurprised when the band took home \\"Best New Artist\\" honors at the 2004 Grammy Awards; \\"Fallen\\" brings together everything there is to love about Evanescence and its music, complete with nine hard-rocking tracks and two quiet, piano-driven ballads, all of which showcase the immense talent of vocalist Amy Lee and lead guitarist Ben Moody, the young co-founders of the band. <br /> <br />Singles such as \\"Bring Me to Life\\" (featuring guest-vocalist Paul McCoy of 12 Stones), \\"Going Under,\\" \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" have gained enough radio-play that most people should be familiar with them, though they are definitely not the only note-worthy pieces on the disc, which also features fan-favorites such as \\"Imaginary,\\" \\"Taking Over Me,\\" \\"Whisper\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" (written by drummer Rocky Gray and rearranged by Lee and Moody), all of which combine Lee's seraphic voice with Moody's incredible rock to form a musical tour-de-awesome.  <br /> <br />\\"Fallen\\" is the perfect introduction to Evanescence and is a must-own for any true fan.

B00065MDSG|5.0|Although perhaps a bit biased, I really like the three albums the band released following In the Court of the Crimson King (1969); even though a lot of folks feel that the quality dipped a bit.  However, I think most people can agree that with Lark's Tongues in Aspic (1973), the band found renewed energy.  This album also marked a point where the band started exploring some of the heaviest music they would release.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included bandleader Robert Fripp (electric and acoustic guitars; mellotron; and electronic effects); John Wetton (bass guitar and lead voice); Bill Bruford (drums); Jamie Muir (percussion); and David Cross (violin, viola, and mellotron).  A lot of critics feel that this was the finest progressive rock lineup ever assembled, and I pretty much agree.  The individual performances and ensemble work are breathtaking - these guys were all superb players.  Bill Bruford details throughout why he is one of the top drummers in progressive rock and rock in general (incidentally, Bill Bruford had bailed on Yes right in the middle of their 1972 tour to join King Crimson and play on this album). On the heavier pieces, John Wetton plays his Fender bass with the treble all of the way up and with a slightly distorted tone, making for a very percussive playing style that meshes perfectly with Bruford's playing. During the lighter moments, he contributes some very clean and understated counterpoint and his vocals are also excellent.  In addition to the dizzying speed with which he cross-picks, Robert Fripp unleashes a range of sounds on the guitar, sometimes anguished, occasionally mellifluous, but always to the point. In amongst all of this chaos, the delicate and wavering violin of David Cross adds a very nice acoustic element to the music, some of which can be overbearing at times.<br /><br />The music on this album juxtaposes sections of virtual silence with passages of bone-crushing volume that makes for an interesting study in contrasts. This is most effectively demonstrated on Larks Tongues in Aspic (Pt. I); which is a piece of music that could very easily knock you out of your seat with the louder passages if you concentrate too hard on the quieter sections. The rest of the album features soft, mellotron-soaked songs (Book of Saturday and Exiles); a punchy and aggressive Easy Money; an exercise in percussion-based minimalism (The Talking Drum); and the quite nearly violent Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Pt. II). The musicianship is of course, stellar throughout and the arrangements are exceptionally good.<br /><br />All in all this is excellent stuff and is very highly recommended. Also recommended from this period of KC is Starless and Bible Black (1974) and Red (1974).n contrasts. This is most effectively demonstrated on Larks Tongues in Aspic (Pt.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane has been called the greatest film of all time by numerous scholars, critics and filmmakers throughout the last 20 years. Though Orson Welles has little else to be remembered by, this film has solidified his place in American film history. In fact, I would go so far as to say this film has solidified Orson Welles's name throughout the entire world, putting his name up there with Fellini, Kurosawa, Bergman, Kubrick and Lang. The film basically was the beginning of the real art film, and nothing before or since has come close. <br />     Though dull on occasion, the cinematography keeps the viewer generally interested, and the plot keeps a steady pace. Welles puts in a good performance, and the entire story is capable of being read into on multiple levels. A must have for any general DVD collection. <br /> <br />10/10.
B000NA28IE|2.0|Perhaps I would have liked the movie more, if I had not read the books (Eragon & Eldest) - but this movie is hardly representative of the book itself. I realize that some movies take liberties with the story in the book for time and complexity considerationsA, but this movie is such a dramatic departure from the book that save the foundation story, and characters, it's hardly representative of the book that Paoliini wrote.<br /><br />If you just want an entertaining, clean, fantasy film this will work. If you want to see a movie based on the book Eragon, the n I suggest you skip this movie and wait until someone else makes one that's better. If you're trying to decide between watching the movie and reading the book, then definitely read the book instead..
B000O178BY|5.0|Yeah, I agree.  Went to a listening party as well.  It was unreal.  Think, as good as The Downward Spiral.  Yeah, maybe even better.  With the political anger behind it, this is definitely the album of the year.
B00061QK02|3.0|Will Ferrell stars as shallow, dense, and sexist San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy with Applegate as his new female competition. Burgundy comes off like a genius compared to his moronic team of sportscaster, weatherman, and featured reporter. The movie comes off as more of a satire on late 1970s big hair newscasts than a laugh out loud comedy. In addition to Ferrell, Applegate and Steve Carell make the most of their parts here. A good movie but not enough laughs to be a great one.

B00005JPMX|5.0|Despite most of the reviewers left not so good reviews, this movie is indeed a very good movie. It was absolutley amazing!! This movie took me completely by surprise. I mean I knew it would be good, but I didn't think it could be as good as it was. From the amazing CGI to the incredible action/fighting scenes it (nonliterally) took my breath away. Don't get me wrong the original was good but it never really took itself seriously, which is good for a movie with giant turtle suits, but now that it has gone from live-action to CGI, it is much more believable and can finally be more serious. One of the most intense and eye pleasing scenes of the movie had to have been the scene between Leonardo and Rapheal on the rooftop. I could feel my mouth drop at least 2 feet. It got sore after a while and I had to close it but the amazing was not over untill the movie was over. It did suffer from some poor dialogue and from few laughs but it is still a movie not to be missed. I can't wait until this comes out on DVD.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Not a bad movie<br /> I really liked it ...<br />This is a movie that will keep you close to your seat till the end, as it is not a monotonous movie at all, it makes you feel good about yourself your life and how everything is connected<br />Its one of the best movies I have seen in the last 12 months...<br /> Good about the movie as you fill fulfilled in the, for having paid for your expensive ticket, to seeing it ...

The characters are very unsympathetic, the main character decides that her job is more important than friends, family, and even her boyfriend (by the way, she willingly flirts and decides to have sex with someone else while out of town. Is this what it takes for her to figure out that she made a mistake?....that would never \\"fly\\" with ANYONE and I dare you to disagree...I would love to see a sequel where she tells him the TRUTH) I digress, but how can anyone consider a job more important than their families?  What if she never saw her father again?...think about your priorities for a second and really consider what this movie portrays: A job in the industry that's supposed to represent the beauty in everyone, by humiliating the inner self and ridiculing INDEPENDENT SELF EXPRESSION!!! <br /> <br />Not even Streep's character portrays any sympathy for herself.  You would think that after witnessing her life crumble she would change, But NO.  This is not the case, not even a simple wink to her former BEST special-assistant.  What does that really say about anyone?   <br /> <br />No sign of real human emotions in any of the characters, just watch how they treat each other.  Please watch the small details that most fail to notice and see through the artificial Prada skin this Devil really wears. <br /> <br />ps - It still made me laugh though, entertaining film. <br /> <br />
B000059QY3|5.0|WOW!!! That's the only word I can say after watching this incredible live version of \\"La Traviata\\". So much so that I watched it twice in a row. There have been so many fabulous sopranos singing Violetta - my personal favorite is still Anna Moffo. Unfortunately, the film version starring Moffo is lip-synched and her \\"Sempre Libera\\" is untouchable except for Gheorghiu's. For a singer that had never sung this role before, Angela Gheorghiu is magnificent. I admit having heard so much negative press about her had prevented me from expressing an interest in Gheorghiu's musicianship. Her voice is spectacular and she has wonderful dramatic instincts. The costumes and scenery are perfect - ornate but not overdone. She's a beautiful lady too with ravishing black hair. Gheorghiu like Moffo really physically looks like Violetta. Gheorghiu is completely believable - radiant and vulnerable in the first 2 acts and close to death in Act 3. Matter of fact, I thought she looked absolutely horrible in the death scene. Sound quality and video are outstanding. Hard to believe, Decca was able to accomplish both from a live performance. Tenor Frank Lopardo has a wonderfully handsome voice and sensitive presence. Their voices blend well together and the chemistry between the leads is very strong. The scene in Act I when Alfredo nibbles Violetta on her lower lip as she attempts to resist his kiss is truly seductive. I do disagree with the prior reviewer's comments about Leo Nucci. Nucci is perfect as the disapproving and stern father. This is probably the best live version of \\"La Traviata\\" on dvd yet. See Angela Gheorghiu in \\"Tosca\\" dvd.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Okay. I love Radiohead to death. But i have one problem. Where in the heck is \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\"? That song is supposed to be on here. Live Recordings? I am so glad that the dreadful \\"Creep\\" isn't on here, although it wouldn't be too terribley bad. I am happy with everything else, but am saddened that \\"Trees\\" didn't make the cut. I wonder why? Is the song not good enough? I have heard the song played live plenty of times, and that's why i'm surprised that it isn't on here. Oh well. I'm not complaining as much as i could be. :)

B000MGUZM0|5.0|The Arcade Fire are a highly remarkable band, with a lot of magic surrounding their aura. I have enjoyed this band from their self-titled EP, and have continued to enjoy everything about their interesting sound. Neon Bible is nothing short of epic, and the band proves that their critically acclaimed \\"Funeral\\" was just the beginning.<br /><br />All of the songs have a very in-depth meaning, have it be about falling bombs, priests/churches, or self-depreciation. The gorgeous \\"Intervention\\" is splendid, with it's pipe organ and plush vocals. The band, with an astounding seven members, works together like a well-oiled machine. \\"The Well & The Lighthouse, one of my favorites, is a song that is bound to be made historic.<br /><br />Arcade Fire is a historic artist, and is bound to captivate the shallowist of listeners with it's sublime music making. I recommend getting this album, and cherishing every last song on it, because this album is definitely the best of 2007.

B000002KKS|5.0|It was evident that the paths of Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne were bound to separate after their not-so-well-received last two albums, Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die. With Ozzy's departure, most fans took the band for dead, considering it was almost impossible to imagine them without their charismatic front man.<br /><br />But Black Sabbath went ahead and found Dio of both Rainbow and Elf fame and forged themselves a new musical route, totally straying from their sludge-driven 70's sound and bringing in more forthright and remarkable elements. Although it wouldn't be until Mob Rules that the band recruited a full-time keyboardist, some of the songs on Heaven and Hell feature sprinkles of keyboards for a broader musical expression. Without getting into any overdone comparisons, Dio was the polar opposite of Ozzy, and both his unique voice and lyrics breathed new life into the band's much gone-stale and somewhat predictable style heard on the previous records. It is undoubtful that Dio revived this band, transforming Sabbath back into their commerically strong days and earning them a new legion of fans. And yet, after nearly three decades, both albums (and Dehumanizer later on) remain classics in the history of metal, spawning songs covered by hundreds of bands, and rightly so.<br /><br />Produced by the amazing Martin Birch whose resume with Deep Purple and Rainbow was already impressive enough, Heaven and Hell is arguably the most important album Black Sabbath have released after their amazing first six albums in the early 70's. It consists of eight songs, all of which flow so quickly that you can't believe it. This is one of the fastest running albums ever. It is packed with the super hits \\"Neon Knights\\", the thunderous album opener with a great groove; and \\"Die Young\\", whose simmering keyboards and sound effects in the intro erupt into a pumping rhythm staccato driven by Bill Ward. The song breaks down into unexpected acoustic passages as Dio whispers atop a layered soundscape before the piece ties in with its majestic ending, with Iommi sporting a crazy shredfest till the piece fades out. Songs like \\"Lady Evil\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\" resolve with smashing choruses and excellent guitar work thanks to Iommi's unique vibrato. The sturdy bass on the former underpins how unique a player Geezer Butler is; and the backing harmonies on the latter are amazing.<br /><br />The title track is not only among Black Sabbath's finest works ever, it also ranks as an all-time favourite heavy metal anthem for its epic intro and its majestic main riff, one of the greatest pieces put on tape ever. Butler's bass is the central element here, so simple yet so effective. Everything else, including Dio's vocals, is centred around the bass, which never lets go from start to finish. Just check out the middle part where everything except the bass cuts out and Iommi lets it throb till he's convinced the timing for his piercing lead solo is right. He scorches through the mid-paced piece sending shivers up and down the spine and putting any critic who claimed he wasn't on par with the likes of Blackmore or Page to shame. The folky ending of the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is monumental and the very reason why he will never be duplicated. While his main strength has always been his songwriting, he also reveals a very different side to his playing on this album, throwing in super-heavy riffs and playing extended leads, like on the final song \\"Lonely Is the Word\\", complete with goosebump-inducing keys and a killer arpeggiated melody.<br /><br />The lyrics took on a completely new vibe compared to the Ozzy-era material, and traces of Dio's fantasy-inspired ideas reflected on the album's second greatest piece \\"Children of the Sea\\", portraying a society that lives under the sea. Needless to say, the use of Iommi's acoustic guitar mixes perfectly with Dio's powerful voice and the subject matter explored, lending itself to various interpretations.<br /><br />To this day I cannot help but be blown away by the timeless, unmatched songwriting of the Dio-era Sabbath. Heaven and Hell was revolutionary in Sabbath's career, and as hard as it may be to believe, I am among the minority who think they even surpassed it with Mob Rules one year later. After that, Sabbath would never be the same again.the timeless, unmatched songwriting of the Dio-era Sabbath.

B00000J7JO|5.0|Ohhh man...Classic album up the wazoo! RHCP have evolved greatly since their joke-like beginning, and Californication is one great song after another. \\"Around the World\\" is splendid starter to this amazing masterpiece, and one of the best guitar jams ever. I am oh so glad that John Frusciante came back for the recording and continuous guitar player for the band, because he is one SICK guitarist. Without him, the Red Hots wouldn't be where they are today. All of the singles off this album are excellent, and even the lesser known jams, such as \\"Purple Stain\\", make one want to jump up and dance. I love this album, and can't believe that it came out almost 10 years ago! wow.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Brad Pitt and his wife are obviously not in a place where I would call paradise. It looks like the worst place to me. As the story progresses, two small boys use their dad's gun to see how far the bullets shoot and see a bus, shoot at it and when the bus finally stops, the boys run home. The drama begins, the part I loved the best was at the end. The American Embassy helps them out but before they leave, the kindness of a small community and a very poor, humble family offer their small hut and warmth, food, medicine, while the wife's life hangs in the balance. Money is offered and this whole poor town and all of us see what true christianity and love for all mankind is really all about. This humble man could have been rich and turned it away. He was a kind soul. I cried and was very touched.
B000000WJZ|4.0|'Siamese Dream' catches Smashing Pumpkins just as they were bursting into their prime. There is a freshness and originality to some of the tracks that is envigorating and that puts the album up there among the best work that the band has produced. <br /> <br />The lyrics are set in true Pumpkin-esque style, often downbeat but still beleiving in hope and salvation. Although it opens on some of the heavier tracks on the album with 'Cherub Rock' and 'Quiet', it never quite gets to the darker levels of tunes like 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings' that typified tracks on the band's later albums. Indeed 'Disarm' could be seen as one of the more \\"mainstream\\" tracks and as an early precursor to 'Tonight, Tonight'. <br /> <br />The album begins to chill out somewhat as it continues into the later tracks, again typical of many Pumpkins albums. 'Mayonnaise' dabbles in relaxation before 'Silverf*ck' proceeds to swing the listener viciously from almost comatose relaxation to guitar thrashing rock and back again. All of this before 'Sweet Sweet' and 'Luna' gently carry the listener to the end of another quality Smashing Pumpkins album.
B000K4X5XA|4.0|This is a classic as I remembered watching it throughout my life.  To now watching it in high definition, I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie.  There were a few scenes that couldn't or didn't get the restore treatment, but in general, the whole film was restored.

Still, I came back a second time, and a third, and a fourth... <br />And each time it amazes me.

B000MNP2K8|2.0|I have to say that I was totally disappointed with this movie. I have been a James Bond fan since they first came out and even though they are a bit on the hard to believe side they were entertaining. I found this James Bond movie to be very dry and slow. I had a hard time sitting and watching the whole thing. It had a couple of scenes that showed promise (which is why the two stars) but once you enjoyed them you were returned to a hum-drum movie. I would have felt over charged to have payed $5.00 for this movie, let alone what they are charging. My advice is save your money and if you don't have all the old Bonds get one of them instead.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" has a very predictable plot, but is visually well done, with good acting (or voice over?) by Hugo Weaving as V. Stephen Rea also does an excellent job as Chief Inspector Finch.<br /><br />A number of the minor actors (esp. Stephen Fry as Dietrich and Tim Pigott-Smith) bring great acting to very stereotypical roles (Pigott-Smith as the feeling-less super bad guy, very Herman Goering-ish, Fry as the only person our heroine can turn to).<br /><br />Unfortunately the plot is a repeat of other plots and books that set a formerly democratic government up as oppressive \\"for the public's own good\\" and personal freedoms get taken away almost without people noticing. Eventually a victim of the government (in this case, V) performs daring acts to get the people to think about standing up to what should be \\"their\\" government.<br /><br />A little too much propaganda-ish at the end, though I did like who the V character was shown to be both hero and villan in the eyes of Evey, the heroine. More of that would have made the plot interesting.<br /><br />Worth watching once or twice.
B000065V3H|3.0|This is a typical 80's romantic comedy. It is very formulaic yet it still manages to be fun. I love looking back on these films because I grew up with these movies, clothes, songs, and culture. <br /> <br />If you love the 80s then you should see this movie. It is better than several other options. However, it is not the best option. I think \\"Say Anything\\" is my favorite. I am partial to John Cusack. <br /> <br />The acting, story, and overall feel of the movie is fine. One of the other reviewers mentioned that some actors went on to huge careers and it shows in some scenes. However, some show their inexperience. <br /> <br />So if you love the 80s you should see this film; if not rent \\"Say Anything\\" because every one should see this movie once.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is an original work of art and makes some great social observations. There are a lot of \\"what were they thinking\\" moments in this movie but I guess that's the point. We are only humans and we make some real big mistakes. I know Pitt was recognized for his work here but I feel the Mexican lady should have been recognized. She should have got top billing. Also, the Japanese actress created a very tragic character. Great film!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|THE HOLIDAY totally surprised me.  When I saw the advertisements on tv, I thought that it was going to be simply a story revolving around Christmas because of the title and the time of year that it was released. I saw that Jack Black was in it and I have never liked anything he has ever done before; probably not because he's a bad actor, but because his other movies have been slapstick comedies with the purpose of being funny only and I usually hate that. Jude Law is one of my favorite actors around today, but I thought before I actually rented the DVD that this project was more than likely a waste of his considerable talent. I like Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet but I thought, how good can they be in something like this, a romantic comedy?    That was before I had received notices by word of mouth and before I read some of the reviews here on [...]. Several friends had really liked it, and I found out that the same person who was involved with writing SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE was involved with writing THE HOLIDAY. I had a coupon for a free movie at my local DVD store and I decided that if I hated it, at least I wouldn't lose any money in the process. To my amazement I was very pleasantly surprised.    All four of the leads were as charming as they could be in their respective roles and you couldn't help but like all of them. Compared with some of their former objects of affections in the story, they were all real catches. The humor was never just for humor's sake and I found myself caught up in their prospective problems. Cameron Diaz was never more human than she was in her role here.  Kate Winslet was never more vulnerable and likable. Jude Law showed that this was not a waste of his considerable talent because he has more charm in his little toe in this role than most people have in their whole bodies. Jack Black was funny  but not just funny for funny's sake and you want so badly for his character to find someone who can appreciate him. Even Eli Wallach who I remember as a bad guy from many movies is delightful in this film.  And the two little girls in this piece steal the show when they're on screen.    In short, this free rental will only be my first viewing . Much like in the case of WITNESS, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, and PRETTY WOMAN, I'll watch this film many times over.  My best friend bought a copy (yeah!!)

The principals are just great, of course; but as an added bonus, the entire recording is crystal-clear (you can hear EVERYTHING) and the fortissimo passages are unbelievably sonorous. PLUS, the drama moves at a good swift clip: never a dull moment here. This certainly must rate as one of the best recordings of ANYTHING, opera or no.
B000002GYW|5.0|This has been my all-time favorite album since it was released.  There are other Eagles songs that are at the highest level (well, excluding chants by spiritual masters), but this is unique in having the entire album revolve around one theme.  I can do without the cacophonous (sp?) ending of \\"Out of Control\\", but overall the album is unsurpassed.
B000929AJQ|4.0|No, it's not the best Nine Inch Nails record, (although I feel like ranking an artist's work is futile and silly.)  It's a good, solid rock record, very focused on sticking a few songs to you and getting out of town.  The more organic \\"band\\" approach is refreshing, and some of these songs are meaner sounding than anything Trent's done previously.  The layers of guitar in \\"Know what you are\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" are absolutely stunning, and deserve to be heard on a huge stereo.  (The thought of people MP3ing this record for tiny headphones seems tragic.)  Overall, I really enjoyed this record, and have no idea why some people complain about it.  He already made \\"The Downward Spiral\\" & \\"The Fragile\\", let the man do what he wants.

Unless luck is on your side, you basically have to go out and make things happen.

Instead of reading this book I highly recommend people use the pages as high priced toilet paper. Then and only then does it serve a real purpose.

Peter Pan feels fresh against much of the modern day animated fare out there, especially that being put out by Disney (Chicken Little, anyone?)<br /><br />The First Disc contains the wonderful movie, a commentary track, and then the rest is for the kiddies.  Peter's Playful Prank is a picture book aimed at the youngest readers and you can read it to your child, let your child read, or let the DVD read narrate the picture book.  Then, there is a preview for the Tinker Bell movie (gag me with a spoon, the movie looks very, very CG and not at all in the classic hand drawn style which was a Disney hallmark).  The last feature on the first disc is an option to jump to any of the songs in the movie and have the lyrics on screen.  This is a fun feature and the best of the bunch, but obviously this disc is for the kids.<br /><br />Disc 2 is mostly for the adults.  Outside of some DVD games and a couple of music vidoes for the kids, the rest of the disc is for the Disney Buff.<br /><br />We get to see a song deleted from the film and sung along to original artwork (not animated, though).  Then Richard Sherman takes us to a song which was never completed, so he went and completed it and Paige O'Hara (the voice of Belle from Beauty and the Beast) sings it.  Interesting look.<br /><br />The Best part of the second disc is Backstage Disney.  This is where the history is.  Uncle Walt gives an explanation on why he made Peter Pan, there is a making of, some art galleries, a featurette from 1952, and two more documentaries.  Adults who want to go behind the scenes for this movie will enjoy this section of the DVD.<br /><br />Disney does well by their fans with the Platinum Editions and they do not fail here.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryhe DVD. <br /> <br />Disney does well by their fans with the Platinum Editions and they do not fail here.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry

B000GIXEIG|5.0|When I first learned of Beowulf and Grendel, I wanted to see it for its star, Gerard Butler.  I then heard of director Sturla Gunnersson's commitment to it, and I had attended the fine new Elliot Goldenthal/Julie Taymor opera, Grendel, inspired by the John Gardner novel that portrays Grendel an outcast.  Well, the movie has convinced me!  Strange and beautiful, it has become one of my favorites.<br /><br />The film opens to the stark majesty of the craggy Icelandic coast.  This chapter, captioned \\"A Hate is Born,\\" quickly unfolds to a sickening scene as the child Grendel (played by the real-life son of actor Ingvar Eggert Sigurasson, the adult Grendel) suffers a horrific atrocity.  His life is then spared out of compassion by Hrothgar, his attacker and King of the Danes.  This good deed does not atone and, years later, when the prosperous King constructs a mead hall for his people to enjoy, the adult  troll takes murderous revenge.  The King's men have drunk their mead and are sleeping, defenseless against Grendel's strength and rage.<br /><br />We next meet our hero, Beowulf, who has washed up on desolate Fish Beach a shipwreck victim.  It is implied that this soggy event gives birth to the legend that he can swim the oceans, and is also a great introduction to Gerard Butler's Beowulf, wryly played as brave and committed, but downplaying his heroic reputation.  Beowulf acts out of a sense of duty when he embarks with his gang to defend Hrothgar and the Danes against the evil troll.  In due course, Beowulf uncovers another side to the matter.<br /><br />Gerard Butler shines in this movie.  Larger-than-life by nature, Mr. Butler gives us a Beowulf that is physical, thoughtful and a bit of a loner.  Stellan Skarsgard's messy Hrothgar plays against Butler with ease as a drunken, grief-struck king who fluctuates between insanity, nobility and political cover-up.  Ingvar Sigurasson's portrayal of Grendel is marvelous: terrifying, yet sweet and humorous when he imitates the fanatical Celtic priest; joyous and defiant at his empowerment; and despairing when his time has come to an end.  Sarah Polley, as Selma the witch, underplays as a woman bearing the terrible burden of seeing \\"how people die.\\"  She is lovely as a bitter survivor.  Her character also provides insight into Grendel's condition.  And the soundtrack is breathtaking, like the movie --  bright, beautiful, cold and primitive.<br /><br />This DVD also includes excerpts from the documentary entitled Wrath of Gods, about the making of Beowulf and Grendel.  Watch these segments.  You might find the harsh conditions that the players endured to make this movie, such as driving horizontal rain and wind gusts that knocked out car windows, more difficult to swallow than the existence of the terrifying Sea Witch!iest; joyous and defiant at his empowerment; and despairing when his time has come to an end.

B000784WMW|3.0|I purchased this version of Jane Eyre because I love almost anything period put out by the BBC. At first, I was under the impression that this was a movie, however it was actually a mini-series based on the novel. It was reminiscent of some of the early 80's soap operas (you'll notice this from the first scene to the last). I thought the actors were well suited for their roles, and the series was well put together, overall. I was just expecting that this would be in a movie format (such as Emma, Pride and Prejudice, etc.) and not in 13, hour long, chapters.
0767802659|5.0|Although this is an inaccurate adaptation of the original, it seems best to interpret this film on its own merit.  Those who have read the novel will find this difficult, but others are in for a treat. <br /> <br />Although somewhat shocking at first, this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing.  This film has aged well, given the current political climate and world events.  Here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of WWII and Cold War-styled propaganda.  Unfortunately, the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope. <br /> <br />Visually, the film is spectacular.  The score by Basil Pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best I have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks. <br /> <br />Despite this recommendation, I should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent, with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted. <br /> <br />An interesting aside, probably not well known outside Australia, is that Australian politician Pauline Hansen (One Nation) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the Federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign (accusations of fascist leanings by her critics).

B00003CXPD|5.0|A wonderful movie about a boy whose family are coal miners in Ireland.  This young boy wants to dance instead of following him father and brother into the coal mines.  He rises above the ridicule of him family and friends and finds a mentor who helps him fulfill his dreams.  What I love so much about this story is that one realizes you don't have to follow the norm in order to be happy and succeed.  What we need to do is follow our hearts.  I loved this movie and I believe you will too.

B000F4RHB6|4.0|Huey Lewis and the News have made as many feel good songs as any other band in popular music. Even when things are going wrong in their songs, like on \\"If This is It?\\" you can't help but sing-along and grin mindlessly. From the distinctive combination of roughness and melody of Lewis's vocals to the solid backing of his talented band (Whatever happened to those great sax breaks that were so common in the 80's?) Huey Lewis and The News rarely disappoints. This collection runs from the band's breakthrough second recording to the DUETS soundtrack. A few quibbles...I think they could have thrown in a cut from the debut album when the band was a little less polished and why the songs are not in chronological order just irritates me. (and that's probably just me!) This band won't change your life, but they definitely have the ability to brighten your mood; sometimes that's exactly what music should do.
1582701709|2.0|While the seller did a stellar job of delivery, the \\"book\\" did not.  This collection of homilies and opinions from people with advanced degrees does little to back up the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of the so-called secret.  A couple of paragraphs would have said what most people need to know about this subject.  Does the \\"secret\\" work?  If you are healthy and have your concrete needs met, perhaps it will work for you.  However, if you are seriously ill or care for a disabled child or are wondering where your next meal will come from, the \\"secret\\" loses its power to reality.
B00005JPMX|2.0|I willingly went to go see this new version of \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\\" I stood in line. I paid for my ticket. I entered the theater. I stayed for the entire show. Clearly, I had been sucked in by the impressive ad campaign, a collection of high-octane television spots, creative posters, and well edited trailers. I have no idea why I allowed myself to experience this film; I already experienced it seventeen years ago, when the live action version was first released. Yes, I was a fan. But I was also a kid--no more than seven--and as we all know, tastes change as one grows. This new film represents an idea that has already gotten old, and it offers nothing original in terms of characterization, plot, and setting. In short, there was absolutely no reason for \\"TMNT\\" to be made. <br /> <br />This computer-generated cartoon is basically a ninety-minute sequence of nonstop energy, a wall-to-wall montage of chase scenes and physical altercations. Nothing much holds it all together, save for one of the flimsiest stories ever conjured up for an animated film. It begins with the description of a ruthless Central American warrior who lived more than 3,000 years ago. Apparently, he had discovered an inter-dimensional portal, one that would give him immortality if opened during an alignment of certain stars. He does so, only to learn of the price he has to pay: not only was every one of his soldiers turned to stone, but thirteen monsters were unleashed, as well. He was doomed to walk the earth for all eternity, unable to die no matter what. <br /> <br />According to the opening narrator (Laurence Fishburne), this 3,000-year-old myth is a new evil to be fought by our sewer-dwelling, pizza-loving heroes in half shells. They have since stopped fighting crime on the streets of New York City; Master Splinter (Mako) has sent the eldest brother, Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor), on a Central American retreat in order to hone his leadership skills. In the meantime, the remaining three Turtles have turned to other lines of work. Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) goes to birthday parties as a costumed character, dressed as ... well, a turtle (complete with a false head). Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) is a Technical Support phone operator for a computer company. Rafael (Nolan North) has failed to get a real job; by night, unbeknownst to everyone else, he's a vigilante crime fighter known only as Nightwatcher. <br /> <br />While visiting Central America on assignment, news reporter April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) reunites with Leonardo and informs him that he needs to return to New York so that he and the other Turtles can be one happy family again. Sound advice from a news reporter who would actually participate in a martial arts battle. It was obvious that this character's inclusion was merely for the sake of appeasing diehard \\"TMNT\\" fans. Her role in this film is so minimal that it's practically a cameo. She serves mostly as a second half to her boyfriend, the clumsy wannabe crime fighter Casey Jones (Chris Evans). <br /> <br />O'Neil delivers a package to powerful business tycoon Max Winters (Patrick Stewart), one that contains a life-sized warrior statue made entirely of stone. It's quickly established that Winters has ulterior motives for his statue collection, all of which are actually the hardened remains of the cursed Central American warriors. He then teams up with the few remaining members of The Foot, who seem to have lost their way since Master Shredder was defeated. Winters wants them to track down and capture the thirteen monsters that were released 3,000 years ago. This will actually be quite easy, as they've all somehow managed to end up in New York City. But why should that matter? A number of cool looking creatures are given screen time, which is a plus for anyone who cares little for plot and characterization. <br /> <br />Upon Leonardo's return, tension between him and Rafael grows deeper: Leonardo feels that it's his responsibility to lead his brothers; Rafael is an impatient hothead who wants to give his own form of justice. Master Splinter seems to be the only one who knows how to patch things up, which is amazing considering how badly he's portrayed in this film. Listening to him speak was grating due to his consistently slurred voice; he sounded more like a drunkard than a wise Japanese rat. He does occasionally give a few words of wisdom. He also enjoys watching soap operas, as noted when he announces that he's off to watch his stories. <br /> <br />I could go on describing the plot, why should I bother? It's weak in every way, from the story to the character development to the special effects, all of which amount to nothing more than a cheaply produced video game. It isn't helped by truly awful dialogue; every line was either a pun or a joke, which might have worked had they not been spoken during some very inappropriate scenes (such as when everyone is engaged in hand-to-hand combat). Who would actually be entertained by such mindlessness? I should think that even fans of the \\"TMNT\\" franchise would be sorely disappointed. And rightfully so: this latest film reduces every character to an insignificant action drone, someone that will fight at the drop of a hat. There's no depth. There's no meaning. It's all eye candy. <br /> <br />Can I get a \\"Cowabunga, Dude\\"?

0743243153|5.0|This one takes me back. - I can think of many books that describe my current understanding and even more that express what I hope to be true, but the one most responsible for changing my reality is a \\"A Road Less Traveled\\" by M. Scott Peck.<br /><br />I read it many years ago when I was at a particularly low point in life, alone, and filled with questions that I ironically considered basic.  Peck's book introduced new concepts, in bite-sized pieces--at just the right time, and in doing so set me on a path that I continue to this day.<br /><br />My reading list has grown dramatically since then, but \\"A Road Less Traveled\\" still occupies a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|I had been wondering for years when we'd get some sort of official treatment on \\"Casino Royale\\", discounting the first two lighthearted attempts.  I actually think Daniel Craig did a fine job as Bond.  At this point in the franchise, we have come to expect roles to change every so often.  I will let the other reviews stand on their own as far as that goes.  It all goes back to the original argument that there was no other Bond after Sean Connery.  That's subjective.  I was born & raised on Roger Moore, while my parents had Sean...and we all like Pierce Brosnan, so it's up to the viewer to decide if the actor is right or wrong.  Personally, I say it's the character we're here to see. <br /> <br />The aspect I DON'T like about this adaptation of \\"Casino Royale\\" is we are led to believe this is pre-007 Bond, but we have modern cell phones, references to 9/11 and, the most annoying part of all, the current incarnation of \\"M\\".  The filmmakers readily admit they HAD to get someone younger to play Bond as this is supposed to be the beginning of the series....BUT in the same breath say there was no one else they could see playing \\"M\\" except Judi Dench who didn't assume the role until 1995!  Come on, now.  Judi does a fine job in the role as one would expect, but I cannot get past the fact that they didn't recast for this film.  This is why I am rating it a \\"3\\" instead of a \\"5\\".  Technically, the film, discs & packagaging are what we'd expect. <br /> <br />It seems confusing to expect us to believe this is the originial story about Bond with so many liberties taken on continuity....BUT if we didn't suspend disbelief, we wouldn't love this franchise as much as we do!  Is this 1957 or 2006?  They seem to be wanting US to decide the timeline with regards to the other films/stories.  Having said that, this is an action-packed film that stands out from the rest of the series because it focuses more on the emotional development of James Bond, not his cache of gadgets.  There is areason that aspect of the character wasn't included & \\"Casino Royale\\" manages to become a unique addition to the series.

B000NA28IE|1.0|ok so you know a movie is bad when you can make fun of it out loud in the theater and nobody cares. after seeing this movie i have no intention of reading the books. i keep hearing a lot of lord of the rings comparisons, and rightfully so. however, the first hour of this movie is an complete rip off of another famous trilogy. this movie practically took the screenplay from star wars and inserted it into a lord of the rings type setting. this movie is just another corporate pawn used to con the consumer out of some hard earned money. do yourself a favor and never see this movie...ever.

B00005JPO8|5.0|Watching `The Lives of Others' I was reminded of so many periodical articles that told of the oppressive existence behind the Iron Curtain.  Besides a poignant drama that puts a face on human misery, the film shows just what those days were like before Gorbachev created the thaw in Eastern Europe.  The movie centers around Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright who wrote benign, but heartfelt shows that didn't cast must suspicion upon him from the Stasi, a government surveillance organization keen on bugging the dwelling places of artists and other suspicious people.  Being prudent and thorough, mole Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) bugs Dreyman's apartment and spends all his working hours listening to every moment, mundane or intimate, inside the writer's life.  Splitting a shift with a colleague, we get an eerie sense--especially with the chilling, understated music--of what life was like, coming into fruition as closely as possible to Orwell's '1984'.  (Significantly, the vast majority of the movie reinacts the events of that very year.)  Besides a lover (Martina Gedeck), Dreyman keeps close company with elder playwright, Albert Jerska, who spars with despair after being blacklisted for outspoken writing.  Tip-toeing throughout, there is an unnerving atmosphere that surrounds the relationships and any brazen initiatives to foster the truth. <br /> <br />I was hypnotized by the movie, but also impressed with its import.  It's not only a story about Dreyman, but it shows Wiesler's shallow existence as a government spy.  In one scene, Wiesler goes to a bar and tries to use a pick-up line that he heard Dreyman use with his girlfriend.   The actors also convey well the fear and resignation of pre-glasnost Eastern Germany.  In one particularly memorable scene, a young colleague at the Stasi comes to the cafeteria telling his friends a joke about the Party Chairman.  Little does he realize that his superiors are sitting just within earshot.  How he nervously finishes his joke showcases a marvelously revealing performance.  Indeed, one of the great observations of the movie is how it zeroes in on those unguarded foot-in-mouth occasions that put decent citizens in great peril.  From beginning to end, `The Lives of Others' really connects the dots between present and past in an illuminating way.  The movie is a testament to the triumph of the arts over the human spirit.  (While I rooted for 'Pan's Labyrinth' to win best Foreign Picture Oscar, there can hardly be too much of a grudge after seeing the winner.)     <br />
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Do you remember when a new Kubrick film came out, and it turned out to be \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" or \\"A Clockwork Orange?\\"  When Altman was at his height in the 70's (or any one of a number of the finest directors from that time)?      This film is one for the record books with all of its creators at the top of their game (and Lubezki certainly deserved the Oscar; he could be the Almendros of his generation).  It propels the viewer right into the story (leaving clueless critics lamenting the \\"glossing over of many of the specifics\\" as they remain particularly obtuse to the clarity of the film's situation and the value of mystery and pace in a good story), but dwells on quiet and poignant angles and moments to reach into the deepest reservoirs of storytelling about our times.     Just take one scene: the protagonist Theo (Clive Owen), fleeing the revolutionaries who had been his accomplices, works at finding a pair of shoes in the home of his friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and then happens upon a conversation between his fellow travelers and Jasper.  He stays hidden on the other side of the room, and Alfonso Cuaron uses the entire space of the screen to tell Theo's story and his solitude; the lighting and mise en scène of the camera are nothing short of brilliant.  The ensuing reels of film are among the most compelling and wrenching that I've ever witnessed; both my wife and I were brought to tears by the intensity of this film, and this almost never happens these days.      So we flip in the DVD: oh, yeah, another movie.  Whoop-de-doo.  Oh, that performance sucks, he's just so, just so, uh, ...      Can movies retain their importance, just as with any artistic medium of consequence?  Can we be enveloped by their worlds, their messages, their moving tales and artistry?    I hope so.

I own every version of every film in Romero's Dead series and by far this is the most complete. From the impeccable packaging to the extensive disc content this product screams quantity and quality. This is how all films should be released to the public, with an all-inclusive package such as exhibited in this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. This product will appeal to any hardcore fan of this genre as well as the new comers. ENJOY
0684833395|4.0|For the most part, this book was good. It took me a long time to read, but I eventually finished it. I though the plot line was great, and the characters were hilarious. The contradictions that characters made only fueled the fire to make war seem ridiculous, and for the most part, it is. The last 150 or so pages is where the book really starts getting interesting though.

B000NA28I4|3.0|With all the new \\"knights and castles\\" Arthurian-type movies that have come out the past few seasons, this was perfect timing for them to turn this book into a movie, although the book is not very old itself.  I think Narnia has been the best so far, and Eragon could have ranked way up there but it was somehow missing something.<br /><br />There's nothing new about the storyline itself...a boy finds a dragon egg and learns he's the dragon rider after the egg hatches and that he must save his kingdom from an evil king.  Perfect imagery for any young boy's imagination, and the scenes with the dragon in the movie are excellent.  The conflict in the movie is underdeveloped and all just gets wrapped up in the end with a quick battle.  The dragon rider and the king never meet face to face, although the ending was left wide open for a sequel.<br /><br />Despite a bit of violence, kids would probably love this movie.  As an adult, I felt the characters lacked definition.  The dragon actually seems out of place because it's obvious they spent more of the movie's budget on the dragon scenes, and less on developing the rest of the story.  Overall, a cute little film that could have been much better!
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of the best rock albums, and one of the groundbreaking expressions of the anguish in the 90s.<br /><br />There's something for everyone in this album. And even though not everyone can understand Cobain's words (I'm still pondering the meaning of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"), Nirvana was an extraordinary album about oppression in America.<br /><br />Nirvana is loud and ferocious.  Cobain's guitars are loud and his chord progressions are tremendously catchy.  In fact, all the songs are very memorable.  This album is actually better than \\"In Utero\\", partly because Kurt Cobain's sanity is still intact to carry over the violent, antagonistic message. Also, the guitars aren't painfully screeching and extremely distorted.<br /><br />Second, the lyrics are very well written.  Ultimately \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was actually Cobain's anger at the entertainment in general.  From the vocals of the album, Cobain really sounds like he hates apathy.  He sings about the mindlessness of youth--they spend so much time taking drugs, having sex, and engaging in gang wars.  Yet, none of them take the time to learn anything.  In a sense, the album name, \\"Nevermind,\\" says everything about teenage alienation at a fractured American world.<br /><br />Nirvana is incredible. They were one of the best bands in America. Even after Cobain died, this album remains as the epitomy of grunge and radical anguish, all with a pop sensibility like no other album had.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I found Rocky Balboa starring Sylvester Stallone to be surprisingly good. It could be possible that I didn't expect much from this movie that sounded so much like a cheap retread of old glory. In fact, like many, I had no intention of seeing it until I was coax into the theater. When I saw it, I was very surprised how good the movie turned out to be and how well Stallone presented this movie. The movie proves to be surprisingly deep, entertaining and well told story. As one previous reviewers stated, it proves to be a worthy \\"bookend\\". This is the best Rocky film since the first one came out 30 years ago. Stallone tell this story with certain amount of flair and good taste. It shouldn't surprised anyone by the time that familiar tune come blaring out that movie's format create a situation we all been waiting for. The fight scenes, exciting as it was, provided an end result of well put together movie. Since the story of this movie have been rehashed many times, I won't bother rehashing it again.<br /><br />The DVD of this movie turned out to be pretty good. The images proves to be pristine, the sound was aggressive and clear and extras proves to be entertaining and educational.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone gambled greatly in making this movie. If it fail, he would have probably been heelhaul out of Hollywood. But fully understanding his own limitation as well as his character, Stallone put together a movie that will definitely surprise many who may see this movie for the first time on DVD.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Things I like about it:  <br />The way the songs tie in with each other.  <br />How it starts and ends with Syd's songs.  <br />Great introduction to Pink Floyd  <br />Cover artwork.  <br /> <br />Things I don't like about it:  <br />Some favorites and well known cuts missing. Welcome to the Machine, Final Cut, Pigs or Dogs, Have a Cigar, Young Lust...  Would it have been better for David to have cut out Momentary (which has Sorrow but no Dogs of War or On the Turning Away) and Division Bell cuts (no Take it Back) and just kept it to the 67-83 material?  <br />Echoes and Shine On You Crazy Diamond edited but if they're going to be on a collection, it's not that bad.  <br /> <br />It serves me well on roadtrips and I'm not skipping any cuts, so I do listen to it all the way through.
B000NA28IE|1.0|Eragon proves to be one of the worst Lord of the Rings clone movies that came out since the Return of the King. Many other reviewers have already taken much pain and trouble pointing all the super major flaws and errors of the movie, I rather not repeat them here. I would like to add one thing that irritated me that wasn't mentioned a lot, one of the great turn offs of this movie (one of near infinite numbers) was the lead actor, Ed Speleers, very colorless and bland teen-age actor who I thought probably got the role because he's blonde. Nothing he does on screen seem real.<br /><br />One of the great disappointment of this film was the fact that it cheapen the book. I believed many have wrote this but I have to do the same.<br /><br />On the other hand, the DVD of Eragon proves to be quite excellent. The images proves to be near flawless, the sound tracks proves to be aggressive and clear with a lot of acton embedded into it, the extras in the two disk edition are laced with good and interesting facts on the movie. Even bad movie got interesting history!!<br /><br />But overall, this is one of the worst movies of 2006 and considering how lousy 2006 proves to be overall, this movie have really sunk to new low.
B000L43AN4|5.0|My opinion is that Tom has 4 different phases in his recorded career. Closing Time/Heart of Sat. Night is the young folkie finding his way, Nighthawks to One From the Heart were gin soaked tales, Swordfishtrombones-Big Time captured Frank and his wild years. After this, you had a mix of all kinds of side projects, showing up on Primus' recordings, and in the middle of this particular journey, jumped ship from Island to go to Epitaph; Bone Machine and Mule Variations and Real Gone read like one story, Alice, Blood Money, and Black Rider read from a different one, but they were riding side by side over the same period of time. Orphans is kind of the bus stop in a one stop sign town, the connecting point to this more recent journey.  <br /> <br />Was this put out due to the Tales From the Underground fan mix? Maybe, but I think he tried to make this as cohesive as possible so it stands on its own, but Tom provides a one stop for those odds and ends that wound up on other recordings (and other labels... the advantage of owning masters is being able to put a collection like this together which would've been impossible otherwise).  <br /> <br />I'm hoping he puts something together with the live recordings over the past 9 years. Some of the tracks on here are live favorites that get their studio recorded debut.  <br /> <br />You'll never hear \\"Heigh Ho\\" the same way again... as sung by Grumpy? \\"Little Drop of Poison\\" will be familiar to fans of Shrek 2.  <br /> <br />If you like Closing Time, this one wouldn't be for you. If you like Small Change but don't have Mule Variations or Rain Dogs, get Beautiful Maladies and Mule Variations. If you became a fan from Mule Variations, you have this already.
B00006JDVV|2.0|Spoiler warning. It's hard to believe how lame the premise of this movie was. Dragons reappear and lay waste to civilization at its peak. But now that there's hardly anybody left, we discover that all you really need to do is kill a single dragon. Because there's only one male. These things have been around since before the dinosaurs, they've outlived everything, and yet there's only ever one male? A single illness or accident would have destroyed the species long long ago. That's such a contrived excuse for a solution I'm embarrassed for the people who wrote, directed, and starred in this. It could have been an interesting story. But that's just pathetic. You get 2 stars for special effects.
B000002U9W|3.0|The cover has been listed on a lot of \\"favorite\\" lists.  <br /> <br />They had also done a PBS concert following the release of this album which you may be able to find online that's worth checking out.  <br /> <br />The title track isn't \\"Echoes\\" but is better than some of the studio side of \\"Ummagumma\\". \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is an exercise in ambient sound.  <br /> <br />2 songs from this era, \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Biding My Time\\" weren't included but there's enough room on the CD for it to go on.  <br /> <br />I think that if you're into groups like Can, you can hear what may have influenced \\"Tago Mago\\", and it is definitely a transition album for Pink Floyd that without this, \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" wouldn't have been made, which in turn would help develop \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".
B000001YOW|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am admittedly new to Porcupine Tree.  I bought Deadwing and thought it was a great CD.  Given that, I decided to give Signify a shot.  I can't say I was impressed.  I bought it based on hearing The Intermediate Jesus.  Being an old-school Brand X fan, I found this track intriguing and figured Signify must contain more of the same.  Alas, it just didn't have much else to attract my attention.  I'm sure a long-time Porcupine Tree fan would see it differently, but this CD was a bit of a let-down for me.
0679735259|5.0|This book is like immersing yourself in war, in the language of it, the sights of it, the smells of it. The writing is like electricity, packed with vivid details and fast-paced. This is also the only book I have ever read personally which goes as far as to argue that even a war like the one in Vietnam is truly glorious to be involved in as a spectator, because there's nothing like war to sharpen the experience of living. A must-read. And thankfully, I don't see any possible way they could make a movie out of it. (If you read closely you'll see that some of this book's dialogue was used directly in Full Metal Jacket.)

Having grown up listening to the Beatles, working in the music industry, and generally absorbing everything I could regarding their careers, both individually and collectively, much of what you see in print these days about The Beatles has all been said before.  Geoff Emerick's book not only provides a unique perspective and additional information, he does so in such an easy-to-read, engaging way, you feel as if you were there with him.  An ABSOLUTE must have.

Hugh Grant has a lovely voice. I would buy an album of him covering classic songs.  The songs are catchy and the album is as sweet and entertaining as the movie.  If you enjoyed the movie then you can have a piece of it with you as you drive.  It's all feel good songs and they make you smile.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is the 195th review of the \\"Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)\\" of \\"Casino Royale.\\"  I have just looked over the previous 194 reviews.  The great majority of them praise this movie to the skies.  Most adhere to one form or another of the \\"Best Since Connery\\" mantra.  Some wild-eyed radicals are even breaking through all the barricades to proclaim Daniel Craig the best Bond ever.<br /><br />I would guess that 180 or more reviewers approach this latest Bond feature entirely as a film in a series of films.  The underlying basis of their criticism, whether favorable to or revolted by the current \\"Casino Royale,\\" rests on the joint creation of producer Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli, directors such as Terrence Young and Guy Hamilton, and, of course, Sean Connery.  To these people, the long-ago contributions of an obscure individual named Fleming hover somewhere between invisible and irrelevant.<br /><br />The tiny remainder of reviewers trot out the memory of Fleming, but mostly to declare that \\"Casino Royale\\" is a faithful reproduction of his novel of the same name.  By \\"faithful,\\" it is evident they mean on the one hand that the plot of the movie is  roughly congruent to that of the book and, on the other hand, they mean the new Bond is not decked out with all manner of gaudy, deadly toys, fripperies and gimcracks.  Only Mr. William R. Hancock, about a hundred reviews back, and one annotator amid the comments even further away, offer convincing evidence that they have read more than a couple of pages of Fleming's writings in all their lives.<br /><br />This new Bond, Daniel Craig, is very much a Bond for the Twenty-first Century.  He is the man of the people that many men of the people like to imagine themselves to be--one many women of the people would simply like to like: straightforward, tough, competent ... hard in any of several senses: a demotic Bond.<br /><br />Fleming's Bond was different.  Fleming's operative was no man of the Twenty-first Century, and barely one of the Twentieth.  His Bond was partly Sidney Reilly, who operated against the Germany of the Kaiser and the Russia of the Bolsheviks.  The greater part of Bond, though, was a romanticized, idealized ... Ian Fleming.<br /><br />Fleming was educated at Eton, Sandhurst, Munich University and the University of Geneva.  In 1939 he was recruited by the Director of Intelligence for the Royal Navy.  By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of commander.  In 1941, American General William Donovan asked him to write a memo detailing the operations of an intelligence and operations service.  Parts of that memo were incorporated into the Charter of the OSS.  Fleming enjoyed telling an anecdote in which he stumbled upon an Axis paymaster gambling in some neutral location.  It had struck him that it would be a very useful thing to bankrupt the man at the tables, thus opening him up to control by British intelligence.  Even more,  he enjoyed admitting that he had gone broke in just three hands while trying to carry out his hare-brained scheme.<br /><br />After the war, he took up the time-honored profession of washed up, highly educated, gentleman spies.  He wrote potboilers for money.  He remembered the name of a fellow member of his London club, one Blofeld, just as he remembered that Axis paymaster at the gambling table.<br /><br />In his first novel, \\"Casino Royale,\\" Fleming created an operative who held the rank of commander in the Royal Navy.  Commander Bond was a member of an exclusive London gentleman's club.  During the war years, while he had been busy assassinating Axis agents in New York and other exotic locales, he had stored away his beloved Bentley, which he now drove at excessive speed over English roads.  He was a gentleman, defined in his mind as a man who never harms anyone--unintentionally.  Commander Bond, like Fleming, was a frightful snob.  He had very specific, even finicky ideas on proper behavior, gamesmanship (not always legal ones),brand named merchandise, and the correct mixing of drinks.<br /><br />Now, compare Fleming's Bond with the Craig's demotic model.  That Bond's no commander in any man's navy.  If he has a military background, it's as an \\"other ranks\\" SAS man.  That Bond in a London club?  As a dishwasher, perhaps.  That Bond, a graduate of Eton, polished in foreign universities?  Hardly--a year at a red brick school, maybe, and a desultory go with the Open University, at most.<br /><br />Take the dinner jacket that Bond wears in the big gambling scene.  It's brand new and fits him perfectly.  Fleming, like his friend Noel Coward,  really wore the things on a regular basis.  They wore cuts slightly out of fashion and slightly but exquisitely baggy and threadbare.  They owned the things, you see, and took pains to preserve them, so as not to be taken for freshly-tailored, nouveau riche bounders.  Craig could pass for the bouncer at a slightly seedy gambling den.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is actually a pretty good movie.  It is true not so much to the book, but to the  500-word summary undoubtedly given to writers who had evidently never heard of it or read it.  The movie is noticeably less faithful to Fleming's written words than \\"Dr. No\\" and  \\"Goldfinger\\" but still more so than most of the films in the Bond series.  (Montenegro, Monte Carlo, who knows?  Who cares?  Baccarat, what's that?)  For all that, however, the heart and soul of this movie is not Fleming's novel but the recent success of \\"Batman Begins.\\"  And at the climactic moment, Craig should not announce that he is \\"Bond ... James Bond,\\" but, \\"Bourne ... James Bourne.\\"<br /><br />DVD STUFF:<br /><br />I have noticed that people look askance at Amazon reviews that deal with the movies rather than their DVD releases.  Keeping that firmly in mind, I confidently report that \\"Casino Royale - Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)\\" comes on a couple of pieces of plastic.

B0002KVUKM|1.0|The concept was a dream for monster fans -- combine Werewolves, Frankenstein (Shuler Hensley), Jeckel/Hyde, and Dracula, with Bram Stoker's vampire-chaser Van Helsing, adapting Van Helsing into a young man, with Hugh Jackman to play him.  Then feature lots and lots and lots of Dracula's Brides screaming through the air against green-screen.  And miss out on many possible expositional scenes.  One of the few movies I've wondered when it would mercifully end, and I'm a Hugh Jackman fan.  My son and I kept saying,  \\"But why didn't they . . .?\\" -- show, not tell, and my daughter-in-law shrugging,  \\"It was what it was.\\"  What it was was a mess.  When the TV \\"Making Of\\" feature was more exciting than the film, Houston, we have a problem.  Read the book instead.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I was close to watching Bond films only if I borrowed the film from a friend or caught it on a plane. This is not that different from recent efforts, some OTT situations, BUT Craig is superb. The action scenes are also excellent. I thought afterwards this formula could produce some wonderful Bond remakes/updates - Goldfinger comes to mind. I look forward to future Bond films.
B000E1MXUU|2.0|Interesting premise, that a lone-wolf terror fighter enlists a computer hacker to liberate funds to finance the process, the genius does so -- AND THEN they go in, litrally, through the bank's front window, with vehicles, guns, explosives.  And there's a helicopter ferrying a full-sized bus.  So why the hacker and the whole concept?  Travolta is manipulating, Halle Berry is appealing, Hugh Jackman genial, especially with Berry, and the character's little girl.  Buy it used and donate to a charity thrift-shop.

B00005NTN5|5.0|Before the Wachowski Brothers did The Matrix, there was the erotic thriller, Bound, starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and Christopher Meloni.  This was a low budget movie (four-and-a-half million dollars) that was to be the calling card for Andy and Larry Wachowski so that they could eventually do The Matrix series.  They both wrote and directed Bound, demonstrating their unbelievable talent in making a film that would quickly become a cult classic in just a few short years.  The script was sharp and fresh with more twists in it than a pretzel.  They were able to get the two sexiest women in Hollywood at the time (Tilly and Gershon) to play the leads with Joe Pantoliano agreeing to take a cut in salary for his role as Caesar.  They got a great Production Designer, Editor and Director of Photography to make Bound's appearance to be more film noir in essence with its dark tones and shadows and sparse cutting.  The rest as they say is history.<br /><br />Bound deals with Corky (played by Gershon), who just got out of prison after having served five years for what she calls a distribution of funds, or stealing.  She was betrayed by her female partner and therefore has a severe lack of trust in those around her.  She takes a job as a maintenance repair guy in a Chicago condo building and soon meets the vibrant and sexy Violet (played to the hilt by Tilly), who's the girlfriend of Caesar, a money launderer for the Mob.  The couple live in the condo right next to the one that Corky is doing repairs in.  The attraction between Corky and Violet is immediate, and it isn't long before Violet sexually seduces her.  Corky knows trouble when she sees it, but that doesn't stop her from giving in to Violet's manipulations.  It isn't long, however, before Violet makes the suggestion to her new lover that they steal two million dollars of the Mob's money, allowing Caesar to take the fall for its lost.  What a deal--two million dollars, plus Violet.  How could any man, or woman, say no to that.  Of course, nothing goes according to the plan as all hell breaks lose with Caesar doing just the opposite of what the two ladies had hoped for.  Then, there's the question of whether or not Corky will once again find herself being betrayed by the woman she cares about.  Any and everything can happen before the ending is reached as betrayal, torture and murder become the norm for this outstanding film.<br /><br />This movie is everything a viewer could hope for.  It's scary, funny and sexy to the ninth degree.  Tilly and Gershon heat up the screen with their lovemaking and dubious intentions.  They capture theirs roles with perfect aplomb, delighting in the subtle nuances that each brings to their particular character and playing off of it.  Joe Pantoliano does a great job as the man who's caught in the middle of these two black widows, refusing to go down without a fight.  One big surprise is how great John Ryan is as Mickey, a boss for the Mob.  The guy is downright scary in his performance.  He never raises his voice or over reacts--just a steady force to be reckoned with.  Christopher Meloni as crazy Johnnie Marzzone brings in the laughs with his wicked sense of humor in the most dour of situations like when an accountant for the Mob is being tortured about the money he's stolen.  When a finger is cut off and falls to the bathroom floor, Johnnie says, \\"Oops.  You dropped something.\\"  Bound is a slick, classy film with top performances by its actors that totally deserves all of the recognition it's received over the years.  It's a movie that you can certainly watch over and over.  I will say that there isn't much in the way of extras on the DVD, but the film commentary is great.  Jennifer Tilly shows up during the last third of the commentary and basically steals the show away from the Wachowski Brothers and Joe Pantoliano.  She won't let anyone get in a word edgewise and acknowledges that she sometimes talks too much.  Gershon shows up a few minutes later, and they both have fun razing Joe about his semi-nude scenes in the movie and his overall acting.  Needless to say, the commentary is loads of fun.  Bound is the type of movie that gives me hope for Hollywood.  This is what filmmaking is all about, and it goes to show that fantastic movies can be made on a shoestring budget.  You don't need two-hundred million dollars to make a classic.much.

B000M4RG42|4.0|Count this film as one that practically demands that a viewer also read the book, which fully deserves its five-star rating. Director Eastwood gives the right balance of coverage of the lead-up to the battle, the battle itself, the dual flag-raising, and the promotional tour to sell war bonds. The movie can't seem to make up its mind whether the immensely successful tour, with its elevation of non-heroes to heroes, was good or not. Obviously the impact on America on a grand scale and the three survivors was profound.  <br /> <br />\\"Doc\\" Bradley is the central character of the movie, with Ryan Phillippe's performance fine and somewhat understated. Adam Beach is the true star, with his moving portrait of Ira Hayes. This human drama is part of what makes the full story so compelling: the diversity of the flag raisers (the book covers the widely varying backgrounds of all six) and the drama that followed. <br /> <br />The movie is shot in very muted tones and colors for the Iwo scenes, matching the drab, seemingly endless grays of the volcanic sands, and the grim battle action. The first wave invites comparison with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", and while on a smaller scale, the action is riveting. The focus on the embedded Japanese hidden from view is exactly right. The 30 days of battle after the flag raising are mostly ignored, as they had to be, other than occasional comments about the real heroes who continued to die.  <br /> <br />I'm ambivalent about the time shifting. It would never have worked in the book. Here it works ok, breaking up what probably would have gotten repetitive, as the tour moved from one stop to another. <br /> <br />For a war movie, this film can be watched (as I did) on a small screen. Don't hesitate to watch this DVD on your TV. Too bad there wasn't any supplemental material, and it's sad to think that both Joe Rosenthal and the man who took a movie of the flag raising are now gone. The movie, indirectly mentioned by showing it being shot next toJoe Rosenthal, helped prove that the photo wasn't staged. The accusations of staging come up a few times in the movie and are never addressed or explained, as we the viewers know what happened.

B000L43AN4|4.0|I've been aware of Tom Waits for many years and have purchased a few of his more popular songs online.  However, this is the first album of his that I've bought.  My criteria for album purchases is that the album price must be competitive with the sum of the download prices for all the songs that appeal to me when reviewing samples.  I was not disappointed and will likely go back and buy some of his older albums.   <br /> <br />For me, 4 stars is about as good as it gets because I reserve the 5 for perfection.  The biggest negative for me was the lack of lyrics in the the lower cost edition.

B00005OAIE|5.0|The song \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" is what got me into Mayer's music.  After that, I needed to hear more of his work.  I listened to \\"Room for Squares\\" and I got hooked.  I love every song on this CD.  He has amazing song writing ability.  The way he can write about his experiences and put it into his music which relate to a lot of people.  I love seeing him on his concert DVD \\"Any Given Thursday\\".  Seeing the way he can relate to the audience with his humor and his amazing performances of every song.  The way he plays his guitar(s) is amazing.  He has a touch of Jimi Hendrix in him. I also love his voice.  He's got really smooth vocal ability and he's very original.  I also love his other CDs \\"Heavier Things\\" and \\"Continuum\\".  He has a great body of work which suprises me that not more people know about him.  If Mayer was an artist before the 90's he would be as well known as Elvis Presley or the Beatles.  I guess it's really difficult for an artist now to be as big as the legends of the past because of the vast information super highway.  But this guy really is a great performer, as good as they come and he's got real soul and I love his blues/rock style.  I'm a big fan and will be for many years to come.
B000065V3H|4.0|This was filmed in the 80's but other than some of the fashions you'd never really know it and that are where I think reviewers here miss the mark. This is not a \\"typical 80's teen comedy\\" in the way that phrase is generally understood.  There are no references to pop culture (movies or music) in this film at all.  Many of the songs used in the film are either not from the 80's or, with the exception of the Billy Idol song used, obscure pop tunes.  The soundtrack to this movie is barely noticeable.     There are no decade defining actors or actresses in this film either.  No Anthony Michael Hall no Molly Ringwald et al.  Other than Patrick Dempsey in \\"Loverboy\\" I don't remember any of the people in this film in anything else during the 80's.  This movie should never be lumped into the \\"Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club/Pretty in Pink\\" trilogy of sorts.  It's a much different type of movie the most obvious reason being John Hughes did not direct or produce this film.    I originally saw this movie in 1988 on VHS while I was a freshman in HS.  The plot of this movie could easily be set in 1967, 1977, 1997 or 2007.  I may be mistaken but I don't think cliques in High School were an 80's phenomenon that disappeared after 1989.  As far as I know there are still jocks, nerds, and being \\"cool\\" in HS is still and always will be defined by who you hang out with.      This movie used the still annoying habit of trying to cast 23 year olds as high school students.  Most of it is obvious but amazingly enough Amanda Peterson, the prettiest girl in school, was really 16 at the time.  Perhaps that is what makes the movie more enjoyable.  If you are looking to watch a teenaged HS comedy that most of us can relate to on one level or another you might like this.  If you want to watch a \\"decade defining 80's movie\\" you should look elsewhere.

0783240236|5.0|Melanie Daniels is a young socialite who amuses herself with elaborate practical jokes, but meets her match when she engages in a verbal sparring match with lawyer Mitch Brenner at the local pet-shop. Discovering that he's looking for lovebirds for his younger sister Cathy, Melanie goes to elaborate lengths to win their argument, and ends up driving all the way to his mother's home in Bodega Bay to anonymously leave two caged love-birds in his living room. It is an amusing premise, and the buildup to an interesting romance - but this isn't what Hitchcock has got on his mind.<br /><br />Due to a series of events, Melanie ends up staying at Bodega Bay and so is present to witness the bizarre occurrences that follow. For reasons beyond anyone's comprehension, the birds in the area begin to attack human beings. Seagulls, crows, sparrows - all unexpectedly flock together and attack people and dwellings, without any warning at all and often with fatal results. The town becomes gripped by paranoia and fear, and the only thing that is more terrifying than the attacks are the tense stretches *between* the attacks when the birds settle silently on power lines and jungle gyms, watching and waiting. In perfect Hitchcockian pacing, the attacks and the townsfolk's reaction to them start small, before building into full-blown hysteria and panic.<br /><br />Obviously, some of the special effects are dated, but I was surprised to find that in many cases they hold up well. They are certainly still good enough to sustain one's belief in attacking birds, and even when they're not so good, the story is strong enough to cover it up. Besides, some of the best and most horrific scenes have the birds completely absent; such as Mrs Brenner entering a house, and gradually finding evidence that the birds have already struck. Her search culminates in the finding of a dead body, all witnessed without any music or sound effects - she's so shocked she cannot make a sound as she flees. It's harrowing, no matter how many times I see it.<br /><br />One question that emerges from the movie is inevitably: \\"Why are the birds doing this?\\" We are never given a reason, and some viewers are initially frustrated at this. But worrying about that misses the point of the movie entirely. It is not important *why* the birds are attacking, simply the fact that they *are* and being a witness to how people react to it. In fact, the very fact that no one can rationally explain what is happening adds to the horror of the situation. (I am reminded of Alfonso Cuaron's \\"Children of Men\\", another excellent film that hypothesizes that men and women can no longer conceive babies - we never find out why, we only witness the world's reaction to the phenomena).<br /><br />In a less serious tone, another reason I love this movie is the window that it opens on a past culture, one that existed not so long ago. This is a time when a woman would smile indulgently when a man gives her the wolf-whistle, when she always has her knees together even when she's navigating a dingy, who is perfectly groomed no matter what her situation, and doesn't feel the slightest shred of guilt in wearing a fur coat or smoking cigarettes. Some of these aspects of feminine life are obviously better left to the past, but this 21st century female can look back on this time with a sense of nostalgia; it's a world I never experienced and it captures the feel of 1950's small-town perfectly.<br /><br />Behind only \\"Psycho\\" as Hitchcock's most famous film, \\"The Birds\\" is a must-see movie that paved the way for hundreds of other `nature-goes-berserk' films.

Some of these aspects of feminine life are obviously better left to the past, but this 21st century female can look back on this time with a sense of nostalgia; it's a world I never experienced and it captures the feel of 1950's small-town perfectly.  <br /> <br />Behind only \\"Psycho\\" as Hitchcock's most famous film, \\"The Birds\\" is a must-see movie that paved the way for hundreds of other `nature-goes-berserk' films. Tense, creepy, unsettling, and incredibly entertaining, \\"The Birds\\" is one of those movies that you just have to see before you die - and watch out for Hitchcock's cameo - he's the man coming out of the pet-shop with the dogs just before Melanie goes in! <br /> <br />

B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd made an album that can't compare to what bands like Yes, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, and others were trying to create with a concept album about life as we all knew it for 1973. The Dark Side of the Moon is like a cosmic journey of the human experience, and one journey a person must hear to understand. The themes tied within the songs are layered with amplified sound effects. The music created was also a landmark as it signified a time and space in music history with the sort of ending of the psychedelic sixties style with what would become the progressive rock sound of the seventies. The AOR radio stations built their format around this album, and with having an energy all it's own, The Dark Side of the Moon is something every music lover must experience during their lifetime.
B0000000KW|3.0|I love Ringo.  I love his legacy, his relationship in the Beatles, and his voice.  I've never been convinced that he is a dramatic, exciting drummer, but he seems to have done well enough with the Beatles.  I bought this album after reading the reviews on this site, and after reading a book by Ken Mansfield who claims to be have been the master-mind behind its release.  I don't find it to be something I am excited about hearing.  It is just the same old stuff re-invented.  It has some great session men on the album, and the music is tight.  It's just that it offers nothing daring or new.  It just the same old stuff by a dear musical friend.  Not sure if I will ever listen to it again.  I hope to, as I paid for it, but it offers me nothing musically or Beatle-wise, or Ringo-wise.  Nothing. Perhaps I am being unfair, perhaps it will take time.

The sound is so much clearer on CD--even after all these years. As for content, I didn't buy it for \\"Send Her Your Love\\"... you can get that cut anywhere. I got the set for \\"Outside My Window\\" and \\"Come Back as a Flower\\". Both have such clarity. You can hear the fingers stick to the accoustic guitar strings between chord changes, and the vocalist breathe.

0553582461|5.0|Fools' fate is the third and final book of the Tawny Man trilogy from Robin Hobb and it closes out Fitzchivalry Farseer's story which began with the Farseer Trilogy. <br /> <br />Fool's Fate begins with the sole heir to the Farseer throne of the Six Duchies, Prince Dutiful, embarking on a quest to fulfill his promise to his betrothed Outislander princess, the Narcheska Elliana.  Prince Dutiful has put himself in a very difficult spot by agreeing to bring her the head of a legendary Dragon named Icefyre, who failed to protect the Outislanders during the redship war.  Not only is this quest seemingly impossible since no one has seen this Dragon for generations, but the challenge of a man versus a Dragon is seemingly insurmountable. <br /> <br />Fitz has taken the responsibility of Skillmaster for the Prince's very raw magical \\"skill\\" coterie consisting of Prince Dutiful, the Queen's advisor and Fitz' mentor Chade, and Thick the slow witted servant.  As advisor and spymaster for the throne, Fitz has also discovered that there are some mysterious and unexplained forces motivating the Narcheska and her Outisland contingent.  The Fool, established as the Jamallian noble Lord Golden has also explained to Fitz that he expects to die on this mission, completing his lifelong prophecy.  On top of this, Fitz has found himself as a tutor to his Father figure Burrich's son in the \\"wit\\" magic, and neither Burrich nor his son are even aware who he is.  Fitz finds himself trapped by who he was and unable to proclaim himself to those who are the closest to him. <br /> <br />This final chapter to Fitz' saga explores themes of faith, redemption, fate, loneliness, and unconditional love.  Hobbs' characteristic metaphorical narrative style patiently flows from page to page, building in intensity until the climactic peak achieved at adventure's end.  However, the transformative personal journey that Fitz undergoes through these pages is the true plot, and ultimately the most gratifying.For in Fitz one finds themselves, and that is the gift this book bestows. <br /> <br />As stated, Fool's Fate reaches the \\"adventure\\" climax about 3/4's of the way through, however it does not suffer for that.  There are so many questions to be answered and storylines to be tied up that it rightly takes a number of pages to follow them up.  Hobbs certainly does not rush this final chapter, resulting in a hefty 900 pages although these 900 pages went by faster than any other comparatively sized novel I have ever read.  <br /> <br />I leave this book and Fitz' story edified, but ultimately with a bit of sorrow.  It is said that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same spot, but Robin Hobbs did so an amazing six times.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|<br />I dreamed about writer-director  Nancy Myers' THE HOLIDAY last night.  It is a honey of a romantic comedy, something out of Hollywood's golden age.  No one smokes, witty dialogue substitutes for swearing, love scenes are passionate kisses, and violence is slapstick comedy.  Myers loves old Hollywood; with her ex-husband, Charles Shyer, she made the successful remakes of THE PARENT TRAP and FATHER OF THE BRIDE and its sequel.  By herself she wrote and directed the romantic and funny WHAT WOMEN WANT and SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE. <br /> <br />What a wonderful cast Myers has for THE HOLIDAY, which is about \\"house swapping\\" at Christmas time.  Kate Winslet (Iris) is a London journalist who lives in a storybook cottage south of London.  She finds that the man she loves is about to get married to someone else.  Cameron Diaz (Amanda) lives in a Beverly Hills mansion, designs movie trailers, and has just kicked out an unfaithful live-in boyfriend.  The two women \\"meet cute\\" on the Internet, Amanda answering Iris' ad for someone to swap houses for Christmas season.  It is perfect for both, as it always is in movies of this type and never is in real life--Iris is lonely in her cottage, while Amanda craves someplace small and quiet.   Diaz and Winslet are both wonderful.  Myers' lovely script makes them come alive as actresses with witty dialogue and romantic situations at holiday time.  <br /> <br />Soon Amanda finds Jude Law (Iris' brother Graham) on her English cottage doorstep and, of course, falls in love with him almost instantly, especially when she learns he is a widower with two small children.  And Iris has two very different men pop up in her life in Los Angeles:  Jack Black (KING KONG) as a film composer named Winston, and Eli Wallach (in his best role in decades) as a 90 year old retired screenwriter.  All of the performances are superb, miracle of miracles no one smokes or swears (thank you, Nancy), and Myers (and her designers) do magical things to contrastLos Angeles and rural England at Christmas season. <br /> <br />The ending is Hollywood fairy tale romance that you can see coming from the film's mid-point on, but it still makes you feel in love with life and movies out of a bygone era.  The only flaws are a Hans Zimmer score so obtrusive that I had to turn on the English subtitles on my DVD player to get the dialogue, and the movie runs a bit too long at 136 minutes.  Otherwise, THE HOLIDAY is pure cinematic magic with five wonderful actors in peak form.  I can't wait to see what the incomparably talented Nancy Myers does next. <br /> <br />
0789723107|5.0|If you work with webdesign or other related areas where you have to think about how users will use your creations, you will no doubt find good use of this book. In this area you will no doubt hear about Jakob Nielsen, as he screams loudest. He's also way off the mark in most areas, and where Nielsen brings stuff down, Krug ignores that, and his book is all about pulling up the good stuff. That will just poor good ideas and common sense over the reader, and I personally have learned a lot from this book. <br /> <br />I use it like a mix of rules and inspirations. Read a few pages now and then, maybe look over it after making a design for an internet page, and you get ideas, reasons to fix or change stuff, and just common sense approach to your work. Just get it, you don't have to filter as much jibberish as with Nielsens books which is the most similar material, and if everyone had this Internet would be a nicer place for all.

0374105235|5.0|For those wanting to know more about how one becomes a child soldier in Africa and some of the details this is definitely a good read.  There are deadpan descriptions and recollections of blood/gore and traumatic experiences which lends a great deal to the narrative.  Most of the book actually deals with the displacement and wandering of the author from place to place before and after being a child soldier, and the actual accounting of things the author did while a child soldier are not for the most part specific, but more generalized.  If you're looking for blood and gore descriptions catering to those who look specifically to read such things, I'd recommend Vietnam books written by soldiers.  This is definitely a good book and an eye-opener.

Little did she know that she would witness a killing and be discover a world of fantasy and violence that she would never have believed existed. The worst part is that her past, present and future are intricately intwined with this world and now nothing for Clary will ever be the same. <br /> <br />This story is a debut novel for Cassandra Clare and she has done an admirable job of creating an urban fantasy of demon killers, demons, werewolves, vampires and warlocks that is action packed and does a great job of holding your attention. I enjoyed her characters and look forward to reading the next book in this series. I suspect they will only get better.  Although City of Bones was not quite as dark in substance as Holly Black's Tithe and Valiant, I can see where fans of those books would enjoy this one as well.

The stunt doubles do really great jobs in this film. Keiichi Tsuchiya (the real Drift King) is even in this film as a fisherman. He also does some of the stunt drifting and you can access a small portion from the special features menu. Great movie and definately worth the price! I actually saw it twice before I bought it.

B000BJS4SU|3.0|Well, I liked the album in it's entirety.  Forget about the folks who whine that this isn't SRV, so what?  It's John Mayer, Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino laying down some nice jams.  Ok, the music might come off a tiny bit sterile cause it's not SRV or JIMI, but not enough to make any sort of difference. <br /> <br />My one gripe and it's a big one, is the sound quality of this album.  I consider it sonically poor, hence the missing stars.  I know live albums are difficult to master well, but it's done all the time and the Producer really fell flat on his face here. It's really a shame that this recording sounds so amatureish as the music is so good.
1594489505|5.0|With his second novel, Khaled Hosseini proves beyond a shadow of doubt that \\"The Kite Runner\\" was no flash in the Afghan pan. Once again set in Afghanistan, the story twists and turns its way through the turmoil and chaos that ensued following the fall of the monarchy in 1973, but focuses mainly on the lives of two women, thrown together by fate.<br /><br />The story starts decades before the Taliban came into power in 1996, and ends after the era of Taliban rule. The main character begins life as a \\"harami\\" - the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy man and one of his housekeepers. Forced to live in a small shack with her emotionally disturbed and possibly epileptic mother, Mariam lives for Thursdays, the day her father comes to see her, bearing small gifts and showering her with the affection she craves. Naturally, Mariam wants to be a part of her father's life and fit in with his legitimate family, but when she attempts to force his hand, she is rebuffed and feels betrayed by his reaction. Her impetuous actions bring an end to the life she has known for fifteen long years, and lead to an arranged marriage to a much older man, a shoemaker, whose views on the rights of women mirror those that the Taliban would soon enforce.<br /><br />During the time that Mariam is dutifully enduring her unhappy marriage, a neighbor gives birth to a baby girl, whom they name Laila. By her ninth birthday, Laila has grown up to be a beautiful child with blonde hair, turquoise-green eyes, high cheekbones and dimples. Unfortunately, her mother lives only for the day her older sons will return home from fighting the jihad, and is consumed by the vision of a free Afghanistan. Laila's best friend is a boy named Tariq, her confidant, defender and co-conspirator, and by the end of communist rule in 1992, Laila is fourteen, and beginning to see Tariq in a different way that she does not quite understand.<br /><br />The enthusiastic rejoicing at the end of the jihad is silenced by the internal battles of the Mujahideen, and when the bombs start falling on Kabul, Laila and Tariq are forced apart. Circumstances can make strange things happen, and Laila soon becomes a part of Mariam's husband's household, by necessity rather than choice. The rest of this unforgettable story reflects the heart-rending sacrifices of these women, and allows the reader a peek behind the burqa, to the heart of Afghanistan.<br /><br />There are parts of this book that will have grown men surreptitiously blotting the tears that are on the verge of overflowing their ducts, and by the time you get to the middle, you won't be able to put it down. Hosseini's simple but richly descriptive prose makes for an engrossing read, and in my opinion, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is among the best I have ever read.

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick is a fascinating and unique book that my children and I just finished reading. If you liked to be on the leading edge of new trends in the publishing world, I would definitely suggest you checking this book out. <br /> <br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is unlike any other book I have ever seen. Part film, part comic book and part great story, this book moves quickly and pulls the reader along every step of the way. My children loved the fact that after the first night of reading for about 20 minutes, we had covered about 80 pp. There are over 280 illustrations in this book, full page illustrations. In between the illustrations is an enchanting story and we learn about the double entendre of the title.  <br /> <br />This book reveals the value of friendship and loyalty. It promotes the value of dreams. It shows the ability for one to be invisible to those around them. And it promotes preserverance in the face of adversity. And we were delighted to discover that one of the character's in the story was an actual person, though the story is fictional. It gave us something to research when we were done reading the book. This book will be enjoyed by all ages in your family and is destined, in my opinion, to begin a new wave in children's books.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0345360338|1.0|Having read Elizabeth Chadwick's \\"The Greatest Knight,\\" I set aside my natural preference for male authors when it comes to novels involving war, and read \\"Falls the Shadow.\\"  While I adored \\"The Greatest Knight\\", I find two major problems with S. Penman: she does not do male historical subjects justice, and she is a closet snob.<br /><br />  The first is proven by the fact that fully a third of this novel is set in bed: either in birthing scenes, death scenes or to a lesser degree love-making scenes.  These scenes are obsessively drawn-out in relation to the historical sweep the novel purports to compass.  The point is even more starkly proven by the fact that death scenes and female gossip scenes pre-empt the pivotal time the supposed main protagonist spends crusading in the Holy Land, a time which made Simon de Montfort's name and reputation are made as \\"The greatest soldier in Christendom.\\"  Not a single scene is set in Outremer where the Crusades took place, nor is any scene even narrated in retrospect.  There are a grand total of two battle scenes in a 500-page novel.  Considering the epoch-shaping battles that took place during de Montfort's lifetime, this is perhaps unforgiveable.<br /><br />  The proof of the second point, that Penman is a closet snob, is well illustrated by the way she has her heroine, Nell, treat an impoverished country priest when he is brought to minister to her in-law, Ellen, who is dying at childbirth.  Prior to the death, Nell threatens the priest with Royal wrath if he doesn't perform sacraments contrary to church doctrine, then, further threateningly exhorts him to lie about the nature of the death, then physical abuses him when he meekly descends the stairs to try to fill his empty stomach in the hall following the death.  This scene, and others, bespeaks a rather nasty personality behind the novel.  This is not the way a Royal would act towards an unfortunate lesser: it is the way a middle-class author with imaginary pretentions to higher rank might behave.<br /><br />  Penman also has an extremely distracting and irritating habit of conspicuously omitting conjunctions.  Example:  \\"I'd have taken them with me if only I could, hope they'll understand one day.\\"  Extremely awkward, and distracting.  The author is trying too hard to be clever or original and it doesn't work.<br /><br />  All in all, not worth reading when one could have Elizabeth Chadwick instead.gher rank might behave. <br />   Penman also has an extremely distracting and irritating habit of conspicuously omitting conjunctions.

B000MV9026|2.0|Two weeks ago, the kids and I went to see Happy Feet. I wanted to walk out about 5 minutes into the movie. The movie had several stories going on, and within the first five minutes, the audience was hit with penguins singing lusty songs lustily to one another. Time and again Hollywood works to trick us into watching cartoons that are better suited for adults. They could have used less suggestive songs and portrayed the same actions going on.  <br /> <br />My 10 year old son lost interest in this movie pretty quickly. My 6 year old daughter loved the dancing. I was saddened by the bad science information (the egg that the father dropped would not have survived, they freeze almost instantly and it is practically impossible for the father to get the egg back up on his feet once he has dropped it.) I also couldn't figure out why Mumble's feathers took so long to molt properly. I think it was perhaps to emphasize him sticking out from the crowd and to help others identify him easily. At any rate, it was scientifically unsound. And then there was the whole environment twist. And of all the countries that Mumble could wash ashore it...isn't amazing that it was America instead of say Australia or somewhere in Africa...I <br /> <br />I don't mind giving my children environmental information, but I prefer to do it in a factual way, not covered up in a bunch of dancing and mumbo jumbo. If you want to see a good movie about penguins, watch The March of the Penguins.[[ASIN:B000BI5KV0 March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)]] It is excellent!
0451457994|5.0|\\"No one can truly say he knows God until he has handled something and this can only be in the holiest of holies.\\" Joseph Smith (History of the Church 4:608)<br /><br />First, I heartily recommend that a Space Odyssey omnibus be published.  Have all four of the novels published under one cover, plus include \\"The Lost Worlds of `2001'\\" as a DVD disc 2, the one with all the extras and deleted scenes.  If \\"2001\\" is the essential companion to the movie, then \\"The Lost Worlds of 2001\\" is the essential companion to the novel.<br /><br />Second, if we remember that \\"2001\\" is primarily a film event, then we can understand this book on its own terms.  This book is intended to be merely a companion to the film, and a reminder of that cinematic experience in the pre-cable, pre-VHS, pre-DVD days of a few decades ago.  That is why the early edition has the stills in the middle.<br /><br />In a side sense, you see how the filmcraft changes the book--instead of Jupiter, the book takes Bowman to Saturn.  In addition to being more plausible, stopping a Saturn would have been more dramatic and have better special effects.  If you have seen \\"Silent Running\\" and the Voyager images, you see what problems this would have caused. But Saturn would also undercut the thread in the rest of the novels. So, \\"The blunder may amount to the opening of a destiny.\\"<br /><br />To be sure, the story is thin--a good example of when to be minimalist, and how less can be more.  That we never see the aliens is the perfect touch.  Like Lovecraft, Serling, Hitchcock, and \\"Signs\\", we just infer things from the operation of the black monoliths, and what happens to Bowman in the ordered course of events.  But it is our wild-running imagination that chills our bones and tingles our spines.<br /><br />(BTW, In \\"The Lost Worlds of `2001'\\", the alien scientist Clindar is given a front and center treatment. Thus story just seems to be a run-of-the-pulp-mill tale, with not mystery and therefore no magic.)<br /><br />The minimalism also allows for several comparisons and contrasts: The Monolith versus Moon-Watcher, Moon-Watcher versus One-ear, Moon-Watcher versus Dave Bowman, Dave Bowman versus Frank Pool, Frank Pool versus Hal, Dave bowman versus Hal, and Hal versus the Monolith.  Each character seems to have several mirrors-be they Hubble Telescope precise, or fun-house absurdities.<br /><br />Thematically, however, the story is nothing new.  Clark previously explored the idea of alien uplift in his book \\"Childhood's End,\\" which reaffirmed ideas that were first articulated by Doc Smith in the Lensmen series.  Uplift, uplift, uplift.<br /><br />Thus, what is so surprising about this book is how Christian it is.  We have these alien Overlords who manifest themselves with the intermediary monoliths, and whose objective is to nudge other life forms up the evolutionary ladder.  Replace aliens with God, the monolith with Christ, and evolution with salvation, then you have the core Christian message.<br /><br />As Athanasius said, \\"God became man so that man might be god.\\"  And as C. S. Lewis observed, \\"In Christ a new kind of man appeared; and the new kind of life which began in Him is to be put into us.\\" This is both Moon-Watcher and Dave Bowman. The implication is that it is us, too.<br /><br />The only drawback of this book is the under-the-breath dread that the rest of the franchise does not have the same charm as the first book.  \\"2001\\" is euphoric, \\"2010\\" is idealistic, \\"2061\\" is optimistic, but \\"3001\\" is sarcastic.

B00005JPGO|4.0|This is a movie that will stay with you for a while...the horrors of African civil war, the exploitation and abuse of young preteen boys[turning them into murderers, in the guise of so-called soldiers], the exploitation of the Africans by the Western world [in order to procure valuable diamonds], its all here. What makes this movie so compelling is the wonderful cinematography & excellent acting. We are treated to beautiful scenes of the African coast and countryside, which is then juxtaposed with the violence & bloodshed due to civil strife. Leo Caprio gives one of his [if not THE] best performance of his career...he plays the ruthless White ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler to the hilt, and totally absorbs his role[with a pretty authentic Rhodesian accent to boot]. Djimon Hounsou elicits our sympathy as the fisherman Salomon Vandy who after escaping slavery in the diamond mines, makes it his life mission to find his scattered family. His son falls prey to the militia, and is trained to become a ruthless child soldier...the weakest role in my opinion was that played by Jennifer Connelly...her performance as the journalist Mandy Bowen just didn't elicit much emotion. The storyline though moves along at a frenetic pace, and though the movie is quite long at abt 2.5 hrs, it is nevertheless compelling and keeps one glued to the screen. Definitely worth a watch!
1577314808|5.0|This isn't the kind of book you can read like you can a murder mystery, or an encyclopedia.  It's not meant to be quoted like a reference, either.  It is best to read the book in small pieces, then to meditate on what you feel inside (don't label the feeling, just experience it) based on it.<br /><br />Probably the best sign of the book's value is this:  The more I re-read passages in the book over the years, the more I get from the same passages.<br /><br />It helps remind readers of what truly matters---the sense of inner peace, joy and abundance, by pointing the way to experience who you are beyond thought.<br /><br />If you want to change your life, this book can help you on your path.

B000JJRIN4|1.0|I am a big fan of Gwens work and her first solo album was great. But I must say this album is bad...real bad.The first time I listened I thought...I love her work...give it another chance.  <br />I tried a second time and quickly repackaged it and put it in the pile of CD's I never want to listen again.  <br />So..bottom line..if you live in a cave and never heard her first solo album...ignore this album and buy her first solo album. <br />Members of No Doubt..it is time to regroup and save this great singer from any future disasters!

B000GPIPVU|5.0|I don't think there's a song on this CD that I don't like. Ray continues with his soulful voice and lyrics in his second album and every song has its own feel. He did include a \\"faster\\" song with \\"Three More Days\\" on this album, which was a little different than his original album but I love it and it's a refreshing change from the slower rhythm of his other work. I could listen to this album over and over without getting tired of it.

B000NA2776|4.0|\\"Life In Cartoon Motion,\\" the debut CD by 22-year old Mika has all the ear marks of a One Hit Wonder that lights up the music firmament for a short period of time like a comet passing through on its way elsewhere in the universe. Not that there's any lack of talent, skill or imagination.<br /><br />There are two big obstacles for Mika in breaking stateside. First, there is no clear cut hit for American radio (although the bouncy \\"Grace Kelly\\" is already a European hit). Secondly, if he beats the odds against non-American white solo men having hits in the USA, there's nothing similar enough to follow it up with as this is a thoroughly original, thoroughly eclectic collection that is all over the place musically.<br /><br />And his musical influences are blatantly obvious to anyone giving a passive listen to his CD. Mika positions himself as the demon spawn of Freddie Mercury and George Michael, with some assistance from grandpa Elton John and brother-in-musical-arms Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters. And yet I continually found myself thinking of the late Harry Nilsson and the mostly forgotten Gilbert O'Sullivan, because of Mika's askew sense of humor and his piano playing anchoring beautiful melodies that sometimes get lost in the maelstrom of the arrangements.<br /><br />The uptempo stuff is fun, the aforementioned \\"Grace Kelly,\\" the delightfully naughty \\"Lollipop\\" with its children's chorus singing \\"suckin' too hard on your lollipop and love's gonna get you down\\" without a hint of irony, the manic disco of \\"Love Today\\" and the fun of \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" which updates Queen's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" for the new millennium.<br /><br />But for me it is the more serious, melodic and forthright songs in which his talent shows. The gimmick-free \\"My Interpretation\\" about the singer deciding it's his version of the break-up that is right, the nearly anarchic \\"Any Other World\\" (\\"say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in,\\") and the fascinating \\"Stuck In The Middle\\" which makes good use of both ends of Mika's vocal register and ends with some scat singing in falsetto. But the CD's highlight is its closer \\"Happy Endings\\" which manages to incorporate all of the various vocal and instrumental extremes of the CD and come up with extremely compelling listening.<br /><br />As the bombing of the latest Scissor Sisters CD in America proves, as a practical matter \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\" has a lot going against it in finding an American audience. But it deserves to be heard and will deserve any success it generates.The Middle\\" which makes good use of both ends of Mika's vocal register and ends with some scat singing in falsetto.

0307275639|5.0|I recently had a friend die from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); coincidentally I received this book as a Christmas gift around the same time. I had seen \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" in the bookstore, but knew nothing about it and wasn't inclined to investigate further. That was my mistake. This is one of the best books that I have recently read, and is perhaps the best I have ever read that deals so directly with the specter of death.<br /><br />Mitch Albom always regarded Morrie Schwartz, his favorite college professor, as a mentor and inspiration. Despite pledging to stay in touch with his professor after school, he didn't until he heard that Morrie was suffering from ALS. After reconnecting with Schwartz, Mitch began flying to meet with him every Tuesday until Morrie died. This book is an account of that interaction, and the progression of the disease. More than that, though, it's an account of the lessons that Morrie taught Mitch, as much by the way he lived as by the things he said. These lessons form the themes of this book, and they are well worth the introspection that's bound to follow in any thoughtful person after reading this.<br /><br />Mitch and Morrie conceived the book together, but, of course, Morrie couldn't see the final product. Fortunately this book is here for all of us to examine and learn from. This is a book that is quick to read, but takes some time to fully digest: I recommend it highly to anyone and everyone, and especially to those with critical illnesses among their friends or families.<br /><br />While this might seem a depressing book, I actually found it to be quite the opposite. Morrie Schwartz taught Mitch how to live and die with grace, poise, and dignity; thankfully Mitch put this story on paper and used the advance money to pay Morrie's astronomical medical bills. Mitch obviously learned his lessons well.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|The first time I listened to Norah's new CD Not Too Late, I was a bit surprised at how different it sounds when compared to her very first hit CD Come Away.  A part of me wants to hear music exactly like Come Away but another part of me appreciates Norah's music no matter what the underlying melody sounds like.  Not Too Late is very much like her sophomore CD Feels Like Home.  I just love her voice, her acoustics, and her band because the music they make together is meaningful and satisfying.
B000MCH5TU|5.0|While because of it`s story and content it is a clear love it or hate it movie, one can`t deny the ability of Gonzalez Iñarritu. he is a very capable director. <br /> <br />the story revolves between four stories in different countries (morocco, mexico, Japan and USA), being the cord that tie them up the comunication (or lack of) and the universal language of suffering. <br /> <br />while Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett did a great job, the movie stealers are two unknown ladys, Adriana Barraza an Rinko Kikuchi, with more than deserved oscar nom for each. <br /> <br />ultimately, you can love or hate Babel, but it is an impressive feat to do what this movie does, and that is to make a testimony that even in the internet and comunications era, we as humans are so different in culture, ways and word, but not as different to not feel the same pain that suffers another human being, doesn`t matter that is your next door friend or a japanese girl in the other side of the world.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation of \\"essentials\\" for the Michael Jackson aficionado--one thing that is really fun about it is that the first disc starts with his earliest work and then proceeds linearly onward. Basically, you get to listen to him grow older and hear how his voice and style change.  It's very interesting.  <br /> <br />To sum up: you get two wonderful discs with a wonderful compilation of the main hits of Michael Jackson--if you have a favorite song of his chances are it's on one of these discs. If you want a more complete collection you might try the Michael Jackson Ultimate Collection of course, but as I own both I must say that I nonetheless find this a very convenient collection for just grabbing to take along with me.  <br />  <br />Great! And God bless dear Michael by the way.

B000KRNCYY|4.0|For some unaacountable reason Celic Woman CDs are not generally available in the UK. Amazon  had to import it for me from the states, and I only heard about it because I am a huge fan of Hayley.  I also have a CD by Anuna that is not normally available in the UK that I bought at a concert they performed in Leicester.  Why do the record companies assume that the English don't like celtic music? <br />But what a revelation this CD is! I had expected to enjoy Haley's tracks most, but to be honest I don't.  My favouries are Meav's two songs, Dulaman and The last rose of summer (with I think Haley singing backing vocals) which is incredibly beautiful.  Lisa's Hibernia is also awesome.  At the monent I can't get enough of this album.  All the singers have beautiful voices, and Mairead is no mean fiddler. <br />Perhaps the only track I'm not keen on is Vivaldi's Rain, mainly because it is far inferior to Hayley's version (in English, called River of Dreams) on Pure.    <br />I was a bit disappointed with Hayley's Scarborough Fair too, thinking it might even be inferior to Sarah Brightman's version, but a quick back-to-back playing put me right.  Hayley makes Sarah sound like Dido!    <br />If you enjoy beautiful voices and good singing then you will love this.  <br />  <br />
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a struggling young father who choses to take a financial internship in the hopes of landing a solid job. The trouble is, there's only a miniscule chance of that -- Gardner is competing with dozens of other hopefuls, among whom only one will be selected to stay with the firm.  <br /> <br />To compound matters, Gardner's wife has just left him, sick of the couple's financial woes. He has custody of their young son Christopher, which brings him comfort -- and panic, when he is evicted from his apartment and ends up homeless. Gardner quickly learns that there aren't many resources for homeless fathers in 1980s California -- there are shelters for men, and shelters for women and children. No one seems to care about single fathers. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, Gardner does his best to hold onto Christopher, convinced that their luck will turn as soon as he's able to complete his internship and land the job. He's also determined not to let anyone know his circumstances, studying in the shelter by the light from outside, and taking care to appear in fresh, clean suits every day. <br /> <br />In the light of many movies today -- violent, stupid-funny, or a just plain waste of $10 and 90 minutes -- \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" was a wonderful treat! Smith is a talented actor, portraying the true story of a man facing horrific odds who refused to give up. We can all use a little inspiration like that.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have had this for a few weeks and I have not had time to give it a listen. I am a fifty something who, like all of us, grew up with The Beatles.  I wasn't impressed when I did listen on my computer speakers (a decent pair).  Today I listened to it with my Sennheiser PX 100's (35 bucks on Amazon ..... great headphones for 3 times the price) and this is a pretty good record,   It is no where near as choppy as I has heard that it was and pays great respect to the original music.   There is a beautiful acoustic version (with full orchestra of course) of \\" While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" that is worth the cost of the record.  This record is great.  Listen to it.
6305075492|5.0|I don't want to go for a long, involved review here, both because others here have already done the job and because much of the movie's appeal lies in just watching it. Show, don't tell. That said, I must respond to the Amazon reviewer's off-handed condemnation of the film as a museum piece. On the contrary! It'll make you shudder, if anything can. Artistic interest aside, one really should remember that at the moment of \\"Caligari\\"'s conception cinema Expressionism was in its infancy. It practically began with this. The movie was, at the time, a bold attempt at creating something new AND that new thing was meant to be a horror film. \\"Caligari\\" was meant to terrify with visuals and atmosphere. More than some \\"statement,\\" it remains a little world unto itself, hinting at something horrid, short, venal, coherent of purpose. Let's be creeped out and not miss the forest for the trees.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|First, let me say I liked this movie.  It kept me engrossed and entertained and the characters were very well developed.  It was also beautifully photographed.  What left me with a bad taste, though, was the inexplicable perfection of the deception.  By the end, we realize the extent of the ruse, but there are too many unanswered questions about how it was pulled off.<br /><br />First, every illusion shown bordered on the supernatual.  There was no attempt to explain any of them to the audience's satisifaction.  Even the \\"Orange Tree\\" diagram did not account for the tree's ability to grow real oranges.  It was clear that the illusions transcended the technology of that time--and probably that of ours too.  For example, holograms are right out of Star Trek, but we are asked to believe they were perfected in 1900 Vienna.  The Prestige, another excellent movie about turn-of-the-century magicians, also had seemingly inexplicable feats, but at least let the viewer in on the secrets.<br /><br />Second, the master deception required a level of manipulation that had far more to do with psychology than illusion.  Eisenheim had to know exactly what Uhl was going to do and when he was going to do it.  Ditto with Crown Prince Leopold.  Can such an intricate plan depend on such a thing and succeed?  I doubt it, unless Eisheim had mastered hypnosis (actually mass hypnosis is a plausible explanation for much of the film).<br /><br />The ending also left me wondering how bad the Crown Prince really was.  He was obviously set up and manipulated too.  To what extent did the manipulation influence his behavior?  And what really happened when he confronted the Countess at the stables?  Given the ending, I can't help but question if Leopold truely deserved his fate.  Lastly, Inspector Uhl seemed more joyful than angry after realizing the deception for what it was.  This was not the reaction I would have expected from a respected senior official who discovered he had been tricked into losing his post.

I listen to the CD's on the treadmill, as I'm going to sleep, sometimes in the morning before I get out of bed, while sitting outside and in the car. Anywhere I want to. I imported it into iTunes and uploaded it to my iPod. I think you get more out of it because you're not being distracted by what you're watching. It makes you really *listen* to their advice.

B000002VMH|5.0|I still enjoy listening to this album 15 years after its release. Annie Lennox really delivered with an outstanding album of 11 tracks. Diva marked the departure from her collaborations with Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) and although there's not as much synth-pop on Diva, Lennox's lyrics on her solo work are just as honest and profound (if not more) as they are on her Eurythmics' compositions. <br /> <br />My favourite tracks are \\"Why\\" - this has got to be one of the most beautifully written songs of all time. This song is so emotive and one feels Annie's pain, particularly towards the end. Other standouts are \\"Cold\\", \\"Money Can't Buy It\\", \\"Precious\\" and especially, \\"The Gift\\". <br /> <br />If the Diva CD doesn't satisfy your hunger for Annie, pick up the Diva DVD, which features a collection of music videos from the album including \\"Why\\", \\"Legend In My Living Room\\", \\"Cold\\", \\"Money Can't Buy It\\", \\"Precious\\", \\"The Gift\\" and \\"Keep Young and Beautiful\\". Annie reinvents herself in each video to be consistent with the tone and feelings of each song. It's an absolute must-have for any Annie fan.
B00005JPMX|5.0|The Turtles triumphant return to the big screen.  This time round its computer generated, which adds substantially to the emotional range of the characters. The art directors hedged their bets by stylizing the human designs rather than the risky attempt to do any ultra-realistic representation. But, the turtles are animated to gorgeous mutant perfection, as you'd expect. This allows for the terrific dynamic between the brothers, especially the expressiveness necessary to convey some of the more charged moments between Leonardo, just returned from South American soul-searching and brother Raphael chafing at the need to follow any orders. The siblings deal with these issues in a way that none of the other incarnations of character have taken on, the series has grown up with it's audience, those of us who were fans of the original books, movies and TV shows. It will still appeal to its new generation of Turtle fans, but it is surely the most clever and best written of any non-comic version. While the film still combines elements of the currently running comic book series with the original film series and the currently running Saturday morning fare. Don't worry, it combines the best elements...really. Throw-backs include some sewer skatin', Splinter joinin' the fray and a \\"I love bein' a turtle\\" closer. Not to mention a timely soundtrack, like a particularly effective use of a cover of \\"Black Betty\\" during Raphael's  scuffle with the Jersey Devil appropriately enough in Kevin Smith's kitchen.<br /><br />The voice talent is particularly notable in TMNT: Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar is an excellent April, Patrick Stewart is a perfect mult-millenium-aged warrior-king, the venerable Mako (Aku of SAMURAI JACK & that wizard in CONAN) is a natural for Master Splinter,  cameos from Kevin Smith a.k.a Silent Bob (as a cook), Laurence Fishburne of the Matrix narrates,  also, Ziyi Zhang, Chris Evans (as Casey Jones) and others.<br /><br />The story is pretty good, if maybe complex: The Turtles have gone their separate ways, Leo off to become a better leader, Raphael embarks on a solo vigilante career in the absence of a team, Mikey does kid's parties as a Turtle-headed Cowabunga Carl, while Donny, of course, is a phone-bound tech-support. No back-story or origin of the turtles is needed nor is it supplied, we are thrown right in with a Lord of the Rings style set-up of a warrior who opens a gateway to immortality, but in doing so, releases 13 monsters upon the world and when our story begins in the present, 3000 years later, the time has come to make things right, with the help of the recently reunited Turtles, the FOOT Clan (lead by Korai, the Shredder's adopted daughter and sole heir, although this isn't referenced in the film) and some living stone warriors from the old days.

037571457X|5.0|A memoir unlike any other I've ever read, Satrapi's story comes across in the pages of a vividly crafted graphic novel, another form of writing I have only recently discovered.  The black and white images of Satrapi's early childhood emphasize her feeling of entrapment under an oppressive Islamic regime. Forced to shed all traces of individuality and Western culture, Satrapi finds that even her outspoken, activist parents can't save her from the fate of their country and the reality of her departure to Austria.  Harrowing images of destruction and death, mixed with uplifting and humorous interludes of happiness and hope, mark this unique graphic novel.  Confined by prescribed gender roles and expectations of social class in Iran, \\"Persepolis\\" reminds me of other narratives like Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\" and Azar Nafisi's \\"Lolita in Tehran\\" that shed light on the experiences of young people growing up in the face of fundamentalism and extremist mentalities. <br />Yet unlike these stories, Satrapi's autobiographical text seems more powerful in the way it's presented to readers in the graphic novel!

B00004VW35|2.0|Shortly after David Geffen sued Young for the dreck he produced in his \\"lost decade\\" with the label, Young compiled a single CD overview of those years for Geffen called \\"Lucky Thirteen.\\" The cosmic hippie joke here, of course, is that the thirteenth track is \\"This Note's For You,\\" which was on Young's first album after rejoining Reprise. From the \\"Old Ways\\" album we got two tracks, \\"Once An Angel\\" and \\"Where Is The Highway Tonight,\\" not bad, but certainly not among his best. After \\"This Note\\" came \\"Freedom,\\" containing his ode to Bush 41, \\"Rocking In The Free World,\\" then \\"Ragged Glory,\\" probably the toughest Neil Young & Crazy Horse album of his career. So...in 1985, six years after his last great album (\\"Rust Never Sleeps\\") and five years before his next great one (\\"Ragged Glory\\"), how did fans react to \\"Old Ways?\\" They didn't. On the album cover we have a nice color shot of Huckleberry Neil, peacefully strolling along a trail on his Redwood City ranch that his fans bought for him. Over the years, they shelled out their hard earned dollars for the good, the bad, and the ugly...everything he plastered his name on. But the biggest \\"Old Ways\\" joke of all came when Young taped an episode of Austin City Limits during the tour. His final number was a 15-minute, bone-crunching rendition of \\"Down By The River,\\" with the Old Ways band out-Crazy Horsing Crazy Horse. Young moaned over and over \\"Be on my SIIIIIIIIIIIDE...\\" as he paused only to spray vibrato-laden notes from his beloved \\"Old Black.\\" Five years later the Godfather of Grunge stepped back up to the plate with \\"Ragged Glory\\" and the resultant live album \\"Weld,\\" but 1985's \\"Old Ways\\" was simply something the fans didn't want, coming at a time when Neil Young's decade-long Geffen joke had worn annoyingly thin.
B000007T2Z|5.0|\\"We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death\\".  Those are the first words you hear as Godspeed You Black Emperor's F#A#oo begins to play.  A low, quiet, droning sound is heard as an aged man reminisces  about the end of times.  Immediately, the listener becomes aware that this is no ordinary album.  It instantly comes off as being extremely dark and depressing, but at the same time it grabs you with a sense of eery curiosity.  Although words like \\"dark\\" and \\"grim\\" may set off a death metal precognition, that would be false.  These sounds are smooth and elegant, not the least bit offensive as a raging metal power chord.  Think of a slow, droning air raid siren off in the distance on a cloudy day to get the feel of the \\"dark\\" sounds present in F#A#oo. <br />  <br />And those sounds fit perfectly with the style of this album.  Unlike conventional rock or pop music, this album has more in common with classical music.  Each of the three songs on F#A#oo is over 15 minutes long.  Each song could subsequently be broken down into multiple movements, almost like a symphony.   The band has over 10 members and lots of instruments at their disposal (everything from violins and brass to guitars).  The resulting sounds are varied but minimalist in nature.  But because of the obvious departure from conventional bands this album can and will be a complete turn off to most first time listeners.  While I may have a hard time convincing people with bad first impressions for whatever reason they may have, I can try to let them know what makes this album such a gem.  Anyone who is willing to push aside any initial qualms with F#A#oo will certainly appreciate it. <br />  <br />The first track is titled \\"The Dead Flag Blues\\" and seems to float around theme present in the monologue spoken at the start of the album.  There are no lyrics in F#A#oo, only spoken words.  After nearly nine minutes the music seems to have gone no where.  Just airy, grim, chords and a faint high pitched fluttering of a guitar string acts as the build to the main theme which begins about 10 minutes in.  There's no melody present in these first nine minutes, just the sounds of instruments emulating what you could perceive as environmental sounds.  As if you were standing in open barren landscape with a cold wind blowing over dark skies.  <br />  <br />One might be quick to lash out that that could be nine minutes of filler but they would be mistaken.  Those nine minutes set the scene.  Those sounds swirl around in your mind and put you in the mood of the song.  The artists then takes that and very very slowly speeds it up, adds a few notes here or there.  Over that time, almost without notice, the music is rising in tension and building up.  Eventually you become aware of the build up and the song will explode into a melody or a solo which in time tapers back off into barely nothing, all while remaining elegant and smooth.   <br />  <br />The music never gets technical and doesn't display any sort of virtuosic instrument playing by any means, but It's these moments that make F#A#oo so great and memorable.  Not only do the artists craft sound-scapes that can truly get the listener thinking, they do so with a certain elegance that's present because their minimalist approach.  They're able to make sounds on their instrument that anyone can produce, but they craft them into situations that leave the listener thinking, \\"How could they possibly know to put that violin note with that trumpet sound?  They fit perfectly together.\\" <br />  <br />Like a movie, F#A#oo is best if experienced in long sessions.  The whole thing could very well be listened through in one sitting, and that's not so hard because it's possible to get sucked into not want to come back out.  This music leaves a lasting impression on the listener.  The textures and production quality easily hypnotizes and keeps the listener enthralled as the songs progress.  By theend of it all you're bound to leave with a deep melancholy feeling of lose.  It's rare to come across such music that can hit all the right notes to trigger a response within the listener, and F#A#oo will have you in a different state of mind when the final sounds taper off.   And while F#A#oo can easily be one of the most morbid, dark, and sad pieces ever written, that's also why it leaves such a lasting impression that sets it above a lot of music.  Sometimes the saddest music is also the most beautiful. <br />  <br />All in all, F#A#oo is quite possibly one of the most thought inducing CDs I've ever heard.  The apocalyptic sound-scapes almost instantly bring to mind scenes of devastation and barren, desolate landscapes.  This runs through your mind the entire album which leads to a movie-like experience.  To me, one of the greatest qualities that make up good music is the ability to move you and to transport you to another place and F#A#oo succeeds at doing this perfectly.  The long track times and drawn out build ups may not be for everyone, but for us who are willing to look into something different for a change will be pleasantly surprised.  Everyone should at least give this album a shot and experience some of the most thought provoking music ever.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's premature death due to cancer was a great loss to the music world. The lyrics of his last album (CD) is full of thoughts related to his Hindu believes of transcendence, and show his strong link to this religion. I believe this album shows a man that has not only accepted his fate, but also points to the fact that this life is only temporary. This is certainly one of, if not the best, of his albums. Every song is great, and the lyrics are superb. This is a must have album for fans of George Harrison, and for anyone that wants a great album (CD) that shows the talent of this great artist.
B000LC55F2|3.0|obviously don't mix. It is an okay movie with great actors. I found myself rooting for one and then turning on him in the end. If the ending hadn't been just the opposite of the beginning I might have liked it. I knew the whole ending by 45 minutes into the show. ALMOST too predictable.
B000LE0THO|5.0|Okay folks, first you have to realize that there are two versions of this album.  The Annaversary Special Edition of which I highly recommend you purchase, and the Sony stick it to-ya version of which you will find every song crammed onto one CD... which means they shortened space time between tracks, shortened beginings (listen to the fade between Big Wheels and Summer and Lightening to hear what I mean), and worst of all lower quality sound. <br /> <br />AARRRGGHHHH!!!!! <br /> <br />Why could they not just release the great Special Annaversary version complete with the 1977 sleeves, lyrics, punch-out, poster and set a mid-ranged price for it instead of doing such an injustice to ELO's second best album? <br /> <br />Jeff and the boys should be charging down to whatever Sony mogul here in the USA is and show him what \\"Electric Light\\" means. <br /> <br />Grief!!! <br /> <br />Overall, if you can, get the Special Editions and leave the other one alone unless, like me, you intend to use one as a keeper and the other as the playing version.  I highly highly recommend Out of the Blue just like all of the other Remasters and find Latitude 88 North to be worth the wait alone. <br /> <br />Now we need a Remastered Zoom, Armchair Theater, Kelly, and other post ELO efforts to make the collection complete.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|better. I couldn't wait to rent this one and now I think I could wait a little longer. It is really long especially for the ending to still have such loose ends. I wish it would have been better and made a little more sense.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|The new Bond stinks.  My first issue, we have a bond before he was a 007, yet he's in 2006 with a modern Aston Martin, modern Omega, and todays cash?  M was taken over by Judy Dench with the coming of Brosnan, yet all of a sudden we just stuck her in a pre-Connery role? This makes no sense.   <br />There is no Q, no gadgets, no Money Penny, no whit, no sexual inneuendos, and terrible acting.  All this guys got is either sad puppy dog eyes or a blank stare that is supposed to be intimidating.  Half of the movie is either watching him run or watching him play cards, neither of which is very appealing or interesting.   I didn't get to know his girl either, which makes it hard to care about her.  I'm truly sad to see the death of all that is Bond.
B000H30B2C|5.0|This film has inspired me to go on to make movies. Where films like Independence Day, Stealth, Fantastic Four and other \\"blockbusters\\" all lack the heart and purpose that King Kong has from the very start.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Why isn't it cold in the Southern Hemisphere? Quaid draws a line on a big map and says that everything above that line will freeze solid (looks to be about the 42nd parallel, I would think a scientist would say north of the 42nd parallel). Why is this massive weather system only in the Northern Hemisphere? The Earth does have 2 poles afterall, and global wind and ocean currents. Being a science teacher, it's difficult to watch a movie like this without finding all the flaws. Then they report that the temperature is dropping 10 degrees per second (600 degrees per minute? is that C or F?). Even though buildings are freezing solid and crumbling, Quaid and his buddy are comfortable in a tent. Then in the library, there are about a dozen people trying to heat up a room the size of a movie theater by burning books. Don't they know that it would be much more efficient to heat a smaller room? Remember when they went on the Russian ship? I was thinking that they could all move into that, and use all the diesel fuel, medicine, and food on board. Dang those poor wolves had a lot of energy considering they were starving to death and half frozen. The special effects were more comical than realistic. If anything, this movie would have a negative affect on the global warming problem, since people can't take this seriously. Two stars since it was somewhat amusing and my wife kinda liked it. <br /> <br />
B00006ADD5|5.0|This film is an exciting epic. It is so hard to even fathom how they accomplished some of the epic-scope scenes. Truly inspiring to all who love films.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso or \\"red pig\\" in 1992 is the movie originally for Miyazaki himself. It is composed of almost everything he loves and is keen on.<br /><br />GINA WHO SINGS CHANSON<br /><br />Gina in this movie is the rare mature adult woman character that sets apart the rest of Miyazaki works. Miyazaki's films have a lot of young teen (or pre-teen) heroines and this movie also has the typical Miyazaki film heroine Fio an 18-year-old plane designer who eventually fell in love with Porco Rosso. But it is no doubt Gina's presence that gives the movie adult romance flavor something like the movies Humphrey Bogart or Gregory Peck might be starring. Gina part of Japanese dub is performd by Tokiko Katou who is said to be the model of Gina.(Miyazaki is the huge fan of Katou's chanson singing for sure!)<br /><br />REPAIR SHOP FULL OF WOMEN<br /><br />Just that was the way of the arms factory also the home for little Miyazaki during the second world war, according to his elder brother. During the war in Japan, most of the men were called for war. The shop must be maintained mostly by the hands of women.<br /><br />FRENCH DUB<br /><br />Jean Reno performs Porco Rosso's voice. He is the huge fan of Miyazaki's works.<br /><br />COLLECTION OF CLASSIC AIRPLANES<br /><br />The movie in itself is the museum of such planes Miyazaki has been crazy about.<br /><br />Verdict: Strong Miyazaki identity. Fan's dreamland.<br /><br />Rating: 93 out of 100. Minus three points for clone-alike little girls in early stage.<br /><br />Recommended for: Every Miyazaki fan who also loves something mechanic and/or classic movie lovers.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|After reading the many reviews on Amazon I was skeptical to watch this movie, but I wanted to see it and judge for my self. Eragon was much better than I expected it to be. Eragon is a 17 year old guy who discovers a mysterious blue object that turns out to be an egg that hatches to reveal a dragon named Saphira. Eragon discovers that it is his destiny to become a dragon-rider like those great riders before him. Eragon has no choice but to  face the evil King Galbatorixa and his dark magic. With the help from former dragon-rider Brom, and a beautiful warrior-maiden named Arya, Eragon faces the forces of evil with his dragon Saphira. This movie has a some what predictable plot, but it was a fun entertaining movie. The Blu-ray disc has a great picture and great sound, but sadly lacks the bonus features found on the special edition 2 disc DVD.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This DVD set is amazing!!! It is everything you want from Kiss' glory days from 1974-1977, and some clips never seen before straight from their archives. The quality of both audio and video is excellent throughout, and the concerts featured are classic shows from a band in its prime. If you were ever into this band, you will need this set in your collection, it's that simple!
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I would not have gone to the theater to see this bond movie. The missing elements were the women at every destination of Bonds' travels, a memorable villain that packed a intriguing but vicious undertone.  It was slow in coming was the relationship between \\"M\\" and Bond and what was expected of his work ethic. This Bond was not the eye candy that Pierce Bonsnan, Sean Connery and Roger Moore brought to character. This was infinitely a rental not worth the big bucks.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Simply amazing, just like all of Miyazaki's films. He is arguably the greatest anime director ever. I highly suggest this film for anyone of any age.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I was one of the people who originally cringed at the thought of Daniel Craig as being James Bond. It's ironic to think that his performance was what actually bothered me the least in this movie.  <br /> <br />Plenty of other reviewers have pointed out the movie's flaws with characters, pacing, claims of realism, etc. So I'll instead focus on two main points that I don't believe have been adequately addressed, and really are getting to me... <br /> <br />First, the idea that this Bond as a character is more true to Flemming's <br />original conception than previous Bonds. Why then, did Flemming's Bond have his military roots in the British Navy whereas this Bond does not? One very important detail in Bond's background being different to begin with is not what I would consider as being a truer representation.   <br /> <br />Second, the (miserable excuse for a)plot. The plot is so full of holes it's hard to know where to begin picking it apart, as it's already in tatters. You know the feeling you get at the end of a movie where you just feel overstretched? Uneasy but not quite able to put a finger on what's causing it? The feeling you get when you wonder just what exactly happened that would warrant your attention for the previous two hours? That is the feeling of a movie that defeats it's own purpose, which is precisely what Casino Royale does. Anyone who would like to refute this must first ponder a few things: <br />-What was the movie's main conflict....Why were we watching Bond? <br />-Why was this conflict necessary to resolve? <br />-How was Bond going about resolving the conflict? <br />-What were the complications in getting it resolved? <br />-Why did these complications arise? <br />-How were the complications resolved? <br />-What was accomplished when it was all said and done? <br /> <br />Please, really try to do this. While it may seem like this is a foolishly simple exercise, it' actually is quite difficult to pin everything down. Yet these elements are the very basis for good storytelling. If you are enterprising enough to think critically about the above questions, you'll find that in the end, the main conflict to begin with is unclear and dubious, the complications end up being unnecessary and nonsensical, and the final \\"solution\\" renders everything that led up to it pointless...including the original conflict itself. <br /> <br />This movie is really nothing more than any other casual action movie, which is a shame because I've always felt the Bond movies to be something more special.
B000J103PC|4.0|The 2006 film \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", based upon the novel [[ASIN:0307275558 The Devil Wears Prada]] by Lauren Weisberger, is comedic drama about a young woman named Andrea 'Andy' Sachs (Anne Hatheway) who, after being unable to find a journalistic job, is recommended by a headhunting agengy to a prestigious fashion magazine known as \\"Runway\\" to be a personal assistant to its editor-and-chief, the infamously cynical, micromanaging and impossible Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Andy, who has never heard of the magazine or Miranda Priestly before her interview, is bewildered as she watches the Runway staff frantically running around in an effort to be ready when Miranda arrives early to work that day.  Also, Andy doesn't make a very good impression due to the lack of fashion sense that she apparently has.  However, though Miranda is initially not impressed with Andy, Andy taking an opportunity to speak up for herself ears her the privilege of working for Miranda in addition to Miranda's other personal assistant Emily (Emily Blunt).  Though thousands of women allegedly would do anything to work for Miranda, Andy's enthusiasm for the job is not great as she comes to grips with running errands such as getting coffee, buying scarves or some other odd, if not impossible, task (such as obtaining a copy of an unpublished \\"Harry Potter\\" novel) that Miranda expects to be completed usually sooner than is possible.  Andy is also reminded by Miranda, Emily and other Runway staff, such as Nigel (Stanley Tucci), that she dresses terribly and really isn't taking the job seriously.  Not wanting to be fired, Andy starts to make a greater effort to fit in as a Runway employee, which includes getting an entirely new wardrobe of top-designer fashions, but not with the approval of her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) or her other friends. <br /> <br />All in all, with good writing, brilliant acting (Meryl Streep earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress), good direction under David Frankel and engaging characters, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a very entertaining film that earns 4 out of 5 stars.  Though ostensibly a chick-flick, many men may not enjoy watching this film; but anyone who has had a difficult manager to work for will probably get a good laugh. <br />
B000A3VTT8|5.0|This is probably the BEST film adaptation of an opera EVER. And I've never seen as good a cast of Cenerentola as this one. Frederica von Stade is perfect as Cenerentola -- her acting and her singing are stellar. Francisco Araiza is a dashing Prince, and Paulo Montarsolo's father is wonderfully three dimensional. The sisters are fun. The direction takes advantage of both the cast's talents and the medium of video -- imaginative, creative. This is just a brilliant DVD.
0800141601|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. At the end, I wasn't sure what to think. (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: Guinevere is going to be married to old King Arthur, but on her way over she meets this guy Lancelot...<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Battle scenes with a little blood, some allusion to \\"adult situations\\" (none happen)<br /><br />Characters: 3 of 5 swords. Just want to say, spot on for Guinevere. She did have a look of terror/confusion for all alot of the movie, but she had a rough time. Sean Connery as an old King Arthur was pretty good, but sometimes he mumbled. Kings don't mumble. Lancelot. We needed a new one. Our Lancelot looked like he walked onto this set from a modern archeologist action/adventure. Not even speaking of the conspicous American accent. He did get a good scene of development, but not enough. And why was the bad guy evil? He even has a bad guy name: Malagant!<br /><br />Plot: 3 of 5 swords. Well, thinking back... the movie's plot was nothing to speak of. Just a love triangle. It's also hard for a modern audience to accept that Guinevere would love someone thirty years older than herself. Malagant seemed to be evil for no other reason than to kidnap Guinevere on several occasions. This movie does have a good script (except leaving out Malagant's motivation).<br /><br />Cinematography: 4 of 5 swords. Good action scenes, by the way. Nice intimate character shots (too bad about the characters). Nice locations. All in all, good cinematography.<br /><br />Music: 4 of 5 swords. A good score by Jerry Goldsmith, but I would have liked to hear some more \\"medievel sounding\\" music.<br /><br />Impact: 2 of 5 swords. This movie came off a bit thin. I didn't really feel one way or the other about most of the characters. Lancelot's \\"change\\" wasn't very noticeable (did he even change?). And I wondered alot about the last couple scenes and felt unsatisfied.<br /><br />All in all, 3 of 5 swords.<br /><br />Would I buy it on DVD? For $5!<br /><br />My notes as a King Arthur (book) fan: Weeeeelllllll, this movie got all kinds of things \\"wrong\\". Lancelot is supposed to be a gallant French knight, Guinevere is supposed to be blond (but this is very minor), and King Arthur, as far as I know, wasn't an old guy. All the other Arthurian characters are missing. No Merlin, Gawain, Morgana le Faye; even Excalibur was not mentioned. They did get Camelot's code pretty right.<br /><br />But, I judge movies on their own merit. So, though it might fail as an Arthurian movie, it might be a good movie. This one left something to be desired, but I'm kinda glad I saw it.ds. <br /> <br />Would I buy it on DVD?

B000K7UBTI|2.0|I'm going to take the con side of this debate.  Having not really read many comics in the past 20 years or so I really haven't followed any of the Ultimates stuff.  I have had it explained to me by a co-worker that's a big comic buff.  It seems to make sense to update some heros' origins.  After all Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan would be in their ninties these days.  I understand that they are also keeping the original origins in place which is fine.  Having said that, I don't know if this is an Ultimate storyline or not but I didn't care for it at all.<br /><br />Taken as a stand alone movie, if viewed by someone with no idea of who Iron Man is, this is really run of the mill.  Tony Stark wasn't a very cohesive character.  As far as alter-egos go this one is kind of a hypocritical milksap.  He makes a big deal out of not building weapons but has an entire room full of indestructible power armor.  If the suits are for research why the need for powerful lasers and missles?  The writer's seem to face the same dilemma most of Hollywood finds itself in these days.  It's politically incorrect to endorse violence but you still have to give the audience a good action packed fight scene.  As a result you get unrealistic portrayals of altruistic millionaire industrialists and pacifists with more weapons than Dirty Harry.  I may be reading a little too much into a cartoon but the level of some of the violence here (one person gets executed with a gunshot to the back of the head) suggests this is for a mature audience.  If this is the case the writers should have given the actions and motivations more depth.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the time it takes to actually get to Iron Man.  Once there the fight scenes are few and far between.  The film suffers from the same problem a lot of live action superhero movies suffer from, too much screen time for the alter-ego.  The action sequences are lacking visual impact.  I think that is partly due to the mediocre quality of the animation.  The CG doesn't mix too badly with the hand drawn but it's all just servicable at best.<br /><br />In the end the movie seemed overly long and convulted with the end being a less than satisfying resolution.  Even if I weren't aware of Iron Man before this I don't think I would recommend it as anything more than a rental.he animation.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I was playing this in a public area and somebody who was obviously a bit schizophrenic came up to talk to me.  He told me that Jesus had come down to him and told him that Bob Dylan was the greatest song writer of all time.  He told me some other stuff too but... well unless you believe that the third bootleg album is the key to stopping all wars, ending all hate and destroying catholicism -- don't ask --  you probably don't really need to know exactly what he said.    The thing is you really don't have to be crazy to enjoy this album.  When I first bought it, I thought to myself, ok this isn't bad, but it isn't great.  But the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it; and it keeps getting better and better.  Right now it is my second favorite Dylan album (right after Blood on the Tracks).   Dylan's voice is very raspy but it is clear (certainly clearer -- and mellower -- than, say, Tom Waits.)  The lyrics while not as poignant, surreal and metaphorical as his early work, are in a way more settled, mature and reflective.      Frankly, I can't testify to the Truth regarding my transient buddy's statement that Dylan is the Greatest Songwriter Ever.  But then I don't have a Jesus coming down to speak to me all personal-like; so he may very well be.  What I can say it that I enjoy this album and perhaps that is all that is really necessary.

B00005JPLU|1.0|When I first saw a Promo for this movie in the theatre 6 months ago I couldn't wait for it come out. Being familiar with the true story of the actual battle I hoped it would be realistic and gritty and stick to the facts, leave well enough alone, instead it's glitzy, overblown and exaggerated in every direction. The real story would make a tremedous movie, done in a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" type of realism or \\"Gladiator\\" treatment. The 300 however is done more in \\"comic book\\" fashion. More \\"professional wrestling\\" goofiness than Ali/Frazier realism. As much as I love the story, this treatment of it makes it look silly and cotton candy like and I won't be buying it when it comes out.

And how exactly does a movie in which \\"everything that can go wrong will go wrong\\" differ from all these standard Hollywood movies where \\"everything that can go right will go right\\"? The movie is *very* overrated. Visually it has some nice scenes, the soundtrack is nice, but it is boring and pointless. I mean, while they were at it they could have had a Russian satellite falling from the sky and killing Brad Pitt, or something like that, and then spend another 45 minutes showing us an alcoholic family in the middle of Siberia.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|\\"Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid\\" is one of the best wesern/buddy films I've ever seen and it's no wonder it's on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#50).  <br /> <br />Paul Newman and Robert Redford create two of their most memorable characters, the two best friends and leaders of the Hole in the Wall gang who make their living robbing banks and trains. Their dynamic is perfect. Butch has the brains and a knack for finding get-rich quick schemes and there's no one faster than Sundance with a gun. After robbing the wrong guy (twice), they find themselves being chased by a gang of guys that they don't want to be followed by. Sick of running, they get Sundance's girlfriend Etta (Katharine Ross) and head to Bolivia, a beautiful place (according to Butch). When they get there, despite being unable to speak Spanish, they begin robbing banks once again leading to fatal results.  <br /> <br />This film has laid the foundation for other buddy movies like \\"The Cowboy Way\\" and \\"Harley Davidson & The Marlboro Man.\\" Movies about two guys, that tend to get on each other's nerves but always stick together when things get dangerous. Newman and Redford have great chemistry together and never make a single moment in the film seem unbelievable. Out of the films that appear on the A.F.I. top 100 list, this is a film that is most likely to appeal to a broader audience (much like Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and Schindler's List; Other films that appear on the list). There's no other way to say it. This is a great film and you need to see it. <br />GRADE: A <br />

B000JBWWRY|4.0|\\"Peter Pan\\" is classic Disney animation at its finest; heartfelt, humorous, lush and colorful.  And it's never looked better, in this digitally remastered release.  As an adult collector, however, I find the extras on this \\"Platinum\\" edition lacking in interest.  First of all, they're pretty much the same as those on the original DVD release of some years ago; and they're hardly comprehensive in their detailing the history of the film.  Given how extensive the Disney vaults are, it's hard to believe there was nothing new to be found.  And as I don't have kids, the games and sing-alongs are wasted on me.  I have most of the Platinum Editions and will continue to buy them for the films I love; I just wish they were a little more geared to adult animation wanks like me!
0743289412|1.0|I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in \\"IT\\", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.  <br /> <br />I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).  <br /> <br />I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. I'm going to go re-read \\"IT\\" now. ;)
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This CD was recommended to me by a friend who liked the idea that John Mayer was making music simply, with only 3 people, yet powerfully.  Without going track by track, this was definitely worth the money and if JMT comes to Chicago, we'll be there!  You can feel the energy, the audience is heard from time to time but doesn't take anything away from the music.  All Mayer fans should have this piece.

B000002N3N|5.0|This is my favorite Enya album, having to do more with a part it played in my life than just its stunning contents.  I listened to The Memory of Trees constantly during a very blue period of my life, when I got my heart broken for the first time.  All of the myriad emotions running through me found a voice in songs like Hope Has a Place and Once You Had Gold.  Even On My Way Home tugged at my heart; it conjured up hope in the wake of a bittersweet seperation.  And, if that were not enough, I felt the reverberation of Tea-House Moon and the title track in the core of my being.  Through it all, there was Enya, an artist without parallel.  Her grace, serenity, and raw emotion washed over me, healing my bruised and fragile heart.<br /><br />Sorry for the soppy, sentimental words, but this is the God-honest truth.  I like each and every one of Enya's albums, some more than others, but The Memory of Trees will always stand apart from the rest, for me personally.  Some people will find the album too sad and bittersweet, but I'm convinced that more will treasure it for a long time to come.
B000001ESF|5.0|First of all, Amazon.com should remove or edit the \\"official\\" Michael Ruby review above; there is no need to refer to Geddy Lee and Neil Peart in such a manner.  Very unprofessional and silly review.    Anyway, \\"2112\\" is a classic by any measure.  Rush basically INVENTED a new genre of music with this album - Progressive Metal.  Even the ridiculously anti-Rush Rock & Roll Hall of Fame puts this on their list of the 200 best rock albums of all time.  This album, in my opinion, is one of three albums that Rush has created that really stand the test of time and are true rock classics (the other two being \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Counterparts\\").  This album sounds fresh and current even today.  What other band in 1976 had a sound like this?    The title track crafts an interesting story of a future ruled by an authoritarian group and one man's struggle to re-introduce music to the world after finding an ancient guitar.  It's a masterpiece, both musically and lyrically.  The other songs on this album are very good as well, especially \\"Passage to Bangkok\\" and \\"Something for Nothing\\".      After the lackluster \\"Caress of Steel\\" album, it's amazing that Rush created a classic like \\"2112\\"; this was clearly a turning point for the band, and they really haven't stopped making good music since this album.
B000001GXJ|3.0|A little too patriarchal for me. Anyway Rigoletto is much the better opera. The father figure is much more simpatico because of his physical handicap, and humiliating career choice.<br /><br />I just got this opera because a) I needed to fill out the order of the useless Bodum glass beaker replacement part I got with it, so I could get the free shipping,and b) I liked the sound of the name Simon Bocanegra
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|After the success of \\"The Prestige\\", here comes another arthouse cum mainstream movie that tackles on the dark art.  It's a rather accomplished movie that would have you guessed from beginning till the end. Rather than divulging the plot that would compromise the enjoyment of this film, suffice to say that the setting is in yesteryear's Vienna, childhood friends got reunited & rekindles their relationship which perhaps, blossoming into love, revolution is in the air with the Prince plotting to topple the Emperor, a Police Inspector that's sniffing around for Eisenheim's blood to please the Prince so as to be promoted to Chief Inspector & along the way, he struggles with his conscience if it's the right thing to do. Everything would come together in the end and viewers, I'm sure would be taken aback by twist that awaits them.  It's for you to find out if what we see is illusion or it's for real.  Overall, a very accomplished and slick production under direction of Neil Burger.  Scores from Philip Glass does give the movie the mood of the time.  Outstanding performances from the ever-versatile Edward Norton, Paul Giammati (is there anything else this actor won't do?), Jessica Biel (looks very much like Scarlett Johanssen as in The Prestige), and Rufus Sewell.  You won't be disappointed and highly recommended.

Las salsas y los merengues estan todos sabrosisimos. No hay una cancion que no este buena. Grammy para album tropical latino!!!
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson took some liberties with the screenplay, but they were great ones.  I've heard some criticize this version of Sense and Sensibility b/c Emma Thompson is too old as Elinor...but I think in the context of her screenplay, it works.  The feel of the movie is different from that of the book, in that these characters are far more likeable and the film is lighter and funnier than the novel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a fan of Star Wars, Star Trek, and Dune, after watching the movie \\"Serenity\\" which was based on this series \\"Firefly\\" I found a new different kind of sci-fi, a different taste. Firefly happens in the future where two superpowers, the USA and China, have survived and influenced mankind the most. There is a mixture of really old technology as that of weapons used, with a western type of scenario and computer keyboards and flat screens which we use today, with new technology such as ships that go in and out of planets effortlessly and are propelled into space with some sort of hyper-speed. The main characters are funny, regular people trying to survive by doing both honest jobs and robbery. Out of nine characters, four are female and you can't help but fall in love with them, each one as unique as the character they play.
B000286RNY|5.0|If you have seen Kung Fu Hustle you'll probably enjoy Shaolin Soccer. It shows a light-hearted approach to spreading the Kung-Fu gospel to different walks of life. Its fun to watch and just enough special effects give it an amusing edge.
0975991477|4.0|Excellent addition to the literature regarding the biological bases of belief, behavior and that which \\"makes us human\\".

B000002G7G|5.0|The VU's third album is oddly available in two different versions. The original release, dubbed The Closet Mix, is the one in the Peel Slowly and See box set. The Valentin mix is this individual release, and is much brighter than the Closet Mix. You can hear the guitars more. Most weirdly, each mix has its own different version of the song Some Kinds of Love. If you are a major VU fan you probably already know this -- and you know you need both versions.<br /><br />To call this the \\"best\\" Velvets album is silly.  Oh, it's a fantastic record, but it's hardly better than VU & Nico or White Light/White Heat.  Each represents the band at a different stage, and each is (sorry for the cliche) great.  The Velvets were the most important American rock band of the 1960s, and they have influenced literally everyone who followed them, even those who don't know them directly. This represents the softer side of the band (as their amps and other equipment had been stolen just before they went into the studio!), but it still rocks hard occasionally, and Murder Mystery is as weird as ever. This is Art and it's medicine and it still goes down well.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This enduring classic is (loosely, very loosely) the story of the WW2 POWs used to build the Thai/Burma railroad.  The larger war becomes a personal battle between 3 forces:  The Japanese soldiers looking for labor led by Colonel Saito, the British soldiers looking to serve as prisoners as dictated by the Geneva Convention led by Colonel Nicholsen (Alec Guiness winning an academy award) and the commandos looking to destroy the bridge led by Naval officer Shear. <br /> <br />The morality (or more specifically madness) of war is adressed in the movie.  The pointless nature of armed conflict reads true today, as do issues of handling prisoners.  The movie's a long one, but one of the few that justifies the added time.  Every piece is indeed required in this classic.
0783231202|5.0|I do not know why I waited so long to watch this movie, but I am glad that I finally did.  The acting was superb, the storyline engrossing, and the ending touching and exhilirating.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy historical dramas and for those who enjoy movies about important Supreme Court cases. <br /> <br />While the scenes on the slave ship were horrifying to say the least, this is an important story that needs to be remembered for centuries to come. And, for the Amistad Africans, the ending was somewhat happy, as they were returned to Africa and escaped the grasp of slavery.

B000K7VHQ4|2.0|Slowly paced and monotonous, this film didn't hold my interest.  The only positive things about it were the convincing period clothing, the cinematography, and the acting.  Unfortunately, I couldn't have cared less about the story and the twist at the end came much too late for the movie to redeem itself.  Finally, if anyone watching couldn't figure out what was going to happen in Eisenstein's last perforamance, then they weren't paying attention.  Miss it.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This is a must-have little bit of kit. I run Cubase 4 on an iMac. I prefer to use a firewire audio interface and the Sonnet FAD-824 allows me to run a Glyph external hard drive from the 800 port on the iMac. If I owned the world, this adapter would be included with every computer that had a firewire 800 port. It is a simple no-brainer solution.
0679745653|5.0|After watching \\"Capote\\", I felt it was time to finally read some of his novels.<br /><br />Now I am not sure why I waited this long.  \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is an<br /><br />excellent afternoon read.  Perhaps the fact that it is not nearly as shocking<br /><br />as it must have been when first published, makes the true qualities<br /><br />of the book stand out.  I also have to say that Audrey Hepburn's<br /><br />and Capote's Holly are two very different women.  Both are adrift in<br /><br />the world, but while the Holly of the movie is airy, there is more of a<br /><br />serious undercurrent that can be felt in the book.
0767847431|5.0|This was the first Harryhausen movie that I saw first run at the movies! I was very familiar with RH's older film work shown on TV in the early 60's and was lucky enough to see the 7th Voyage of Sinbad at the movies in a re-release in the late 60's. When the Golden Voyage theatrical trailer played on TV I knew I would be there! This is one of his best films with some awesome creatures! Kali and the Centaur's fight with the Griffin are stand outs,but they are all super cool! A classic fantasy adventure that should be introduced to younger kids who missed out when Ray was King.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|One could ask why we need another version of the classic novel, Jane Eyre. And actually my son asked me that as I began to watch this new Masterpiece Theater production. You could say that he might have a point there, except that we Jane Eyre addicts need regular doses of our heroine and her Mr. Rochester!<br /><br />Actually, there should not be any reason why this classic shouldn't be re-made periodically with different casts, different screenplays and a different director/artiste at the helm. There is so much in the novel to mine and use in any production.<br /><br />This one did not disappoint. My favorite is still the Timothy Dalton version, but this is a close second. The leads are wonderful, and I liked the updated take on the romance aspect, which took a few liberties, but was enjoyable.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I watch this movie every Groundhog's Day with my wife. Groundhog's Day just happens to be her birthday and she loves this movie! A smart funny romantic comedy with Murry at his comedic best. The supporting cast is excellent and there are many classic lines to quote in this top drawer comedy. The DVD is a good transfer on the regular edition and it does have some OK extra material. This should be in everyone's collection.

A terrific cast, outstanding battle scenes, powerful imagery, and an outstanding orchestral score combine to create an exciting and emotionally-exhilarating experience.

0743289412|5.0|As has been stated in earlier reviews, this is a different kind of work for King. You won't find as much of his standard slash, bash, and shock here--but do we really need to have that in every sentence the man writes? I would have to call Lisey's Story a bit more sensitive, mature, and literary. Not to say that it doesn't have some creepy, bloody, and supernatural flavored moments, but it relies more on the story line and character development rather than on the typical theatrics/gore to propel it. <br /> <br />I know that Lisey's Story has been given some flack by our generation of desensitized slasher addicts, but I really think that in time this book will do a lot to gain him admitance into the \\"literary canon\\" with other great writers of the past and present--just where he belongs. I say way to go Stephen King. King has always been more than just a horror/slasher writer. Come on people! Let the man spread out a bit!   <br /> <br />I have liked every King book I've read (I've read nearly all of them). It's nice to get something different out of him once in a while. I especially like the second half when we get into a bit of the supernatural and/or magical realism flavor--a very nice touch to add interest to the stalker theme (actually there are many themes and plots in this book).  <br /> <br />So if you want to see some diversity out of Stephen King, read this book. If not... yes, by all means, go re-read IT. That's a great one too...
B000002KFJ|5.0|Many people, in my opinion, either give or receive (depending on if they're reading or writing about the album) the wrong impression of \\"Sabotage.\\" Not that the fans are bashing it, in fact most classic Sab fans love this release, but they're sort of giving false info about it. I'm here to right those wrongs. Most would agree that Black Sabbath's experimentation SLIGHTLY began to show up on Vol. 4 (on tracks like \\"FX\\" and possibly \\"Supernaut\\", though the latter is amazing)and reached a climax on the popular \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".<br /><br />However, people explore the topic further, and throw \\"Sabotage\\" in the \\"experimentation\\" group, which scares many listeners and causes them to distance themselves. In reality though, Sabotage is not a very experimental album, at all. It's sound is very down-to-earth, hard-rocking, and is more comparable to their earlier stuff than anything else. The musical style has an appealing, very classic feel, and still manages to evolve, while adding mild and minimum effects and/or sythns (only on select tracks). Likewise, the musicianship is extraordinary and fresh, giving the listener the vintage Sabbath sound, yet delivering unique, new ideas and elements. In fact the most stand-out person here, to me anyways, is the dynamic and energized Ozzy Osbourne. Yes, Tony's riffs are to die for, and of course Bill and Geez perform outstandingly, but the real pleasure on this CD has to be the Ozz. His voice has always been amazing and memorable (especially on early classics), but here he simply shines. He screams and bellows his way through tracks like \\"Hole in the Sky\\" and \\"Symptom of the Universe\\", but delivers chilling, almost unnatural vocals on the epic \\"Megalomania\\" as well. In short, he really surprised and amazed me when I pressed play. Truly magnificent ><br /><br />Hole in the Sky: Being an appropriate and very enticing opener, this rocker really gets you pumped and leaves you thinking \\"Yes! This is what metal is made of!\\" Headbangin', catchy, and hard-rocking, mid-tempo riff, met with heavy-hitting drums and some of those bellowing and LOUD vocals from Ozzman. Incredibly solid to say the least. 9.5/10<br /><br />Don't Start (Too Late): A pretty, talented little buffer between the opener and the killer \\"Symptom\\" that although only :49 seconds, still is a nice number.<br /><br />Symptom of the Universe: Most definitely thee BEST song on the album, and one of Sabbath's all-time best for that matter. Right when \\"Dont Start\\" ends, your ears are overwhelmed with a fast-paced, almost thrash-like riff that sets the pace for this delicious rocker. Ozzy's voice, in particular, is in perfect form and one of his greatest performances off the album. Very obnoxious on Ozzy's part, but good obnoxious, if you get what I mean. He just sings his soul out on here. I especially love the drums, as Bill does some terrific fills and beats. Towards the end, the song slows down considerably, and Iommi strums the acoustic while Ozzy sings some real emotional lyrics. Perfect 10/10<br /><br />Megalomania: Starts off spine-chillingly haunting as Iommi delivers some real dark and gloomy riffs and Osbourne goes real low and sings from his sole rather than his soul. Geezer is also quite noteworthy on this track, cause he's one of the reasons for the haunting atmosphere. The song really gets good, however, when Bill smacks away at the 'ol cowbell, and the tempo picks up, and Ozzy really delivers his voice amazingly. The chorus is especically cathcy, and the solos are of course nothing but the goods. This epic can get no lower than a 10/10!<br /><br />Thrill of It All: This gem starts off with a start/stop, heavy riff that turns into some incredible, extremely catchy and fiery solos. The main riff is mid-tempo and quite driving, but Ozzy is once again the main attraction. His vocals on here are well-ranged, bittersweet, and powerful. The highpoint, though, is the last few verses. They're just fast-paced and enjoyable till theend. The long, ending solo is memorable and shredding. 9.5/10<br /><br />Supertzar: Could be Sabbath's best instrumental, even though I love \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" also. This song is one of the reasons \\"Sabotage\\" got thrown into the experimental club, but the choir and string arrangements add a dark and mysterious atmosphere to the song. The guitar riffs are also entertaining and add much to this masterpiece. For instrumentals this gets a 10/10.<br /><br />Am I Going Insane?: This tune is another reason for the aforementioned debate of this CD being deemed experimental. The main verses are led by strings and synths, along with a louder-than-normal bass guitar keeping the rhythm. While not horrible, this song took some time getting used to, and considering it was the only song I heard prior to getting Sabotage, you could say I wasn't looking that forward to it. Still a good number complete w/ some estranged laughter at the end. A good 8/10.<br /><br />The Writ: They picked an awesome closer to this album, full of great riffs and solos by Tony, speaker-splitting vocals, and some interesting bass effects to boot. This complaint against all the record companies that screwed them over really gets you going about all the corruption throughout the music biz. Quite epic and every bit enjoyable, this 9.5/10 gets you in the balls!<br /><br />Basically, if you're into classic, 70s metal, than I don't know why you don't own this album. Hearing the sub par \\"Am I Going Insane?\\" off of We Sold Our Souls to Rock n Roll could have turned you away completely, but know that that track is the worst off the album, and really out of context on the CD. If you like headbangin' riffs, solid drum work, and above-average vocals that soar higher than eagles than I suggest you get this. I got this album quite a long time ago, and I still listen to and enjoy it often. It's so good in fact, that it crept up to my top 3 Sabbath albums ever, and I've heard them all besides three. Just a metal masterpiece fit for kings.ble till the end.

B000MQ58VS|5.0|This movie had me on a journey from beginning to end.  It is one of those rare special moves that is able to touch on many emotions.  Watching this made me understand the true meaning of imagination and not letting go of your innocent wonder.<br /><br />The movie is loosely based on the life of the man who wrote the play Peter Pan.  The story helps you understand the purity in this mans heart to open peoples mind to imagination.  From beginning to end I was in another world and it seemed nothing bad could happen.  It is really a visual journey that is pleasantly set in England at the turn of the 20th century.  Kate Winslett and Johnny Depp do a superb job in there roles as they show why they are two of the best actors of this current generation.  Except this story has wonderful acting all over.  From the children to the adults who acted as children.  It really is a special tale for all those to see.  I really can't think of anything bad to say about this movie.  For it woke up my creative spirit and opened my eyes to the fantastic Neverland that is in all our hearts.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to view this on Blu-ray and I must say it looks fabulous.  This movie was made for high definition and it really comes out that way.  The sound is also uncompressed allowing anyone with surround sound to enjoy it the way it should be.  I would advise anyone who has children or is open to imagining to watch this wonderful and superb gem.

B000LC55F2|5.0|THE PRESTIGE is the year's best film. Not!! Yet,it is definitely the most intelligent film I have seen in 2006 - a year where a dozen great films came out.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman did 4 films this year and this one is without the blossom of a doubt, his best performance till date. I \\"didn't\\" think too highly of him (Considering he's done a film called Van Helsing; Scoop was a three star grade film; The Fountain rocked while everyone knows XMEN insults my age,really, I'm 22 you see) but he gave a very realistic portrayal of his character. What truly makes Hugh Jackman stand out is not quite his height/poise or dialogue delivery. The real charm lies in the manner in which the actor uses his arms, legs, speech, movements, reactions, etc. to actually make a point to an unsuspecting crowd.<br /><br />While watching The Prestige, I wondered to myself who the second actor was. You see, I had never seen a Christian Bale film (Surprise!) I, personally, think he was as good as Hugh Jackman was. The direction is immaculate and will make the hair on your back stand.<br /><br />It's quite humorous that Amazon forget to include Scarlett Johansson's name on the main page (film cast) She did a good job, her role was limited but it is always good to see someone so beautiful perform in a film as good as The Prestige. In all likeliness, Prestige will restore your faith in films even if it wasn't really lost. There is a great \\"unpredictability\\" about the whole plot but the execution is better than the plot itself. A lot of us including me guessed the twist towards the end but that still was only a part of the bigger twist altogether.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Where Prestige actually stands out is in the film's ability to shock you. The best scenes in the film include the following - When Hugh Jackman is outsmarted by Christian Bale and is left hanging by a rope like a character in a kindergarten show; the scene in which the hats are displayed, the first scene of the film, the rivalry scenes between the two young magicians, Hugh Jackman and his presentation skills as a magician, David Bowie's great cameo, the innumerable twists and many more.<br /><br />Overall, I'd like to say that this film as good as it is, is because it is the kind of film you want to see do good and it does just that. Masterfully. Many comparisons have been made with \\"The Illusionist\\" Now I'm a bit of a Ed Norton fan but realistically speaking THE PRESTIGE spanks ILLUSIONIST on the head three times over without even trying. Not only is it a better, more creative, more captivating film but it's also a bigger film on the whole. If you compare the endings of the two films, you would know what I mean. Nonetheless, both films are definitely worth watching a few times over.cians, Hugh Jackman and his presentation skills as a magician, David Bowie's great cameo, the innumerable twists and many more.

B000002AZZ|2.0|I have grown into quite the Leonard Cohen fan, but this particular CD goes to the bottom of the growing pile of my Cohen collection.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|I finally rented Oliver Stone's \\"World Trade Center\\" last night. I had wanted to see it in the theatre, but my wife had no interest, unfortunately.    This movie is right up there with \\"United 93\\" in how well it captured those horrific events of over 5 years ago. In a matter of 2 hours time, I was taken back to that day where I sat numb in front of my TV... watching scenes that were difficult to comprehend and believe I was witnessing.    I remember when this film was first released, there was a lot of fuss over it being \\"too soon\\" after 9/11 for these types of films to start coming out. Balogna! Stone did an excellent job with regard to sensitivities and stuck to the story that needed to be told. The worst scene is a very brief (and distant) shot of a jumper included only to show what those first responders witnessed when they arrived at the WTC.     In the same way \\"United 93\\" placed the viewer in the cabin that doomed aircraft, in \\"WTC\\" Stone places the viewer in the living rooms and kitchens of those who waited in anguish for news of their loves ones' fates. The performances are top-notch. Stone depicts with great film-making skill the bravery and resolve of the American people during the efforts to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. It is a powerful and moving story that made this guy who never gets emotional watching movies (with the exception of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\") well-up on more than one occasion.    Every American should watch this film (as well as \\"United 93\\") so that they may be remided of WHO America's enemies really are. Regardless of one's political leanings - we must all stand together (TOGETHER, people(!)). We can't forget the events of 9/11.... we can't let political disagreement stand in the way of what needs to be done. Watching movies like \\"WTC\\" is the best way to get a \\"refresher course\\" on what is important and what is not.

089898890X|5.0|I'm simply going to reinforce what you may have heard elsewhere: this is as good a foundational text on jazz and bop drumming as you can find (along with Ed Soph's and Jim Chapin's books). <br /> <br />If you are interested in learning to PLAY jazz and bop on the drums, this book takes you from a level assuming some knowledge of the drum kit, little knowledge of jazz, and brings the two together in a very logical way. <br /> <br />I have milked four years (so far, many more to go) out of this book with regards to the density, depth and entertainment/interest-level of the material.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Like a lot of teenage geeks, I was a fan of the Doctor Who episodes that showed on PBS in the early 1980s, mostly Tom Baker and Peter Davison with a bit of the older Doctors and Colin Baker thrown in.  In the mid to late 1980s, with newer interests, the dropping of the Doctor from most PBS stations, and ultimately the cancellation of the show, I wandered away from Who fandom, filing it with other youthful crushes like (the old, bad) Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br />I heard of the ill-fated 1996 movie/Fox TV revival attempt but the bad reviews kept me away.  But the casting of Christopher Eccleston as the new Doctor in 2005, and talk from devoted fans that the new show was great, piqued my interest, and I was finally able to watch the new series on the DVD set. <br /> <br />In Eccleston's Doctor's favorite word, it's fantastic! <br /> <br />Russell T. Davies marries a deep love for the character and the past history of the show with a modern 21st century sensibility and brings the subtext of the traditional character--the edge of danger, the melancholy of seeing and knowing so much (maybe too much?), the moral gravitas, the whispers of chemistry with the companions--into the text, while keeping much of the sense of wonder and cheeky wit of the original incarnations. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about Eccleston's Doctor and his more than worthy companion, Rose (Billie Piper).  The two, and the relationship between them, are the heart and soul of the series.  Davies' choice to give Rose a real backstory, characters back home who care about her and worry about her, is a stroke of genius, as they wind in and out of the episodes and fluctuate between acting as a good anchor (giving Rose a base of love and support in our world) and a bad one (trying to drag her into a smaller version of life). <br /> <br />The series gets off to a slowish start with the first few episodes.  My initial reaction was \\"Okay this doesn't suck and it's nice to see the Doctor wearing something sexier than a long scarf\\".  But it still felt like a take it or leave it proposition.  The worst episodes, the two-parter featuring the ridiculously farting Slytheen, are paradoxically where things start to gain traction, as we really start to see the intensity of the Doctor's caring about Rose, and about supporting the side of right and good in the universe. <br /> <br />But that's just the beginning.  The show enters a whole new plane in Epsisode 6, Dalek, where the Doctor has a confrontation with the last surviving member of that venerable evil species.  The show fires on all cylinders, from comedic intervals with the bad-guy American gazillionaire collecting alien artifacts, to the Doctor facing his own demons as a genocide and sole survivor of a horrific event, to the potential loss of Rose at the hands (claw? laser arm?) of his most fearsome enemy. <br /> <br />From there through Episode 13, it's a stunning ride that just keeps getting better and better, from moments of laugh out loud comedy to ones that have tears flowing.  The addition of con man Jack Harkness in Episode 9 is just icing on the cake.  The final two episodes are near perfection in wrapping up all the myriad themes and storylines of the series and giving Eccleston's Doctor an amazing send-off. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the team of Rose/Eccleston-Doctor/Harkness is so wonderful, it's just too bad that they only get 5 episodes to shine.  I could have done with another 13 before the inevitable regeneration. <br /> <br />But.  What a series it is.  It does the job, revitalizing and maturing the Doctor Who character and canon and breathing new life into the entire premise of the show, and does it with such panache and verve and confidence that as much as I enjoyed the old Doctor back in the day, this series has leaped to the front of them all as my favorite ever.  To say I look forward to what David Tennant does in the next series is the understatement of, well, several centuries.
B00004SAAY|5.0|I purchased these recordings nearly 20 years ago, when Deutsche Gramophone was still selling them as five individual discs, and at over $20 per disc. With the re-release of the set of all five discs in a single, price-reduced \\"Collectors Edition\\" box set, the price has fallen by more than half, making this one of the outstanding values for high-quality Bach recordings on today's market.<br /><br />But what about the performances? Here's the best way I can sum it up. Having listened to these disks for some two decades, in the car, on the main home stereo system, on portable equipment, on the boom box, and etc., etc., it is, I imagine, inevitable that one ends up memorizing nearly every note. And with that familiarity comes the ability to detect flaws in the performance, missteps, missed beats, the occasional off-tone instrument. Here's the rub: it is difficult to locate any significant flaw in the performances. These performances are about as perfect as one can get, but having said that, there is more. The sound reproduction of this recording remains near or at the top of any Bach recordings with which I've become familiar, and remains in my own thinking the de facto standard by which other performances should be measured.<br /><br />Sound too good to be true? Pick up a set and see for yourself. And then relish the thought that you paid $40 for a set worth far more.

B0009NSE1K|5.0|I write this review in anticipation of their upcoming album in hopes of helping to convince even more people to give this awesome but woefully overlooked band a chance.<br /><br />Can a band be heavy, hard rockin', clever, thoughtful, bluesy, and even a bit funky all at once. Absolutely!<br /><br />This is what Clutch has evolved into and I fully anticipate even more positive evolution to come. This is a band that could at one time certainly be classified as metal that began to recognize their strengths and gravitated towards a different sound without compromising their music at all.<br /><br />Robot Hive / Exodus continues that evolution in several ways, first the keyboard sounds are much more integrated into this album than before, second the bass playing and drumming are allowed to be even funkier and third the blues infuences are even more prominent this time (the last two tracks are straight ahead blues).<br /><br />None of this is to say that these guys don't still rock hard. There are plenty of hard rockin' numbers to be found on this disk.<br /><br />This album like the previous Blast tyrant could be classified as a concept album in that there is pretty much a consistant lyrical theme through the album. This time it involves a robot society and the various happenings within it (which could be interpreted several ways). The lyrics are as usual for Clutch very clever and thoughtful and many tracks have themes couched in what could be classified as religious terms.<br /><br />In the end this record like pretty much all Clutch albums just plain rocks. It invites you to shout and/or sing along as well as think a little bit.<br /><br />Give Clutch a try, I don't think you'll be dissapointed.
B000IZJ1KC|4.0|Four years after his old band dissolved, ex-Immortal frontman Abbath (whose real name is Olve Eikemo) has moved on and founded a solo project. This project, which is simply called I, is a supergroup of sorts because it's comprised of members of Immortal (Abbath and drummer Armagedda), Enslaved (guitarist Ice Dale), and Gorgoroth (bassist TC King). I's debut album is aptly entitled \\"Between Two Worlds\\" because it draws heavy influence from two bands -- Motorhead and Immortal (only without blast beats) -- and sounds like a mish-mash of classic rock, traditional metal, black/dark metal, speed metal, and (to a lesser extent) thrash. The result is one rockin' good time!<br /><br />Most of the songs here are composed of only a single riff, but don't let that give you the wrong impression -- the songs never become overly repetitive or stale. \\"Between Two Worlds\\" features some of the hookiest, most well-constructed, and best guitar licks put to wax by any band in 2006. They are super groovey, meaty, contagious, heavy yet simultaneously melodic, and they build off of each other and flow together remarkably well. Then, to make an already good album even better, the band add controlled and usually melodic guitar solos (which are reminiscent of Iron Maiden and Megadeth), thumping drum beats, prominent bass lines, and occasional melodic vocals to offset Abbath's signature, throaty black metal croak.<br /><br />The album shoots out of the starting gate with an ultra-catchy and oh-so-Motorhead-esque tune by the name of \\"The Storm I Ride.\\" Abbath does his best Lemmy impersonation over a strong, propulsive riff that will have listeners everywhere tapping their feet in rhythm, and a tasty clean solo near the end is the icing on this song's cake. \\"Warriors\\" is a significantly slower tune that is more in line with classical metal and boasts two stellar solos (the first of which is almost beautiful.) Next, the title cut is a superbly rhythmic (albeit overlong) number, and is backed by a catchy, galloping rhythm and a ripping, ascending solo. Then, after that, we are treated to the positively blistering \\"Battalions,\\" which is filled with rocketing tempos, crunchy thrash riffs, and beeping bass notes. \\"Mountains\\" is another catchy rocker, and is highlighted by a jaw-droppingly great guitar solo (the album's best!). Moving along, \\"Days Of North Winds,\\" has more strong, chug and churn riffs and a blazing solo; \\"Far Beyond The Quiet,\\" is a very open and majestic-sounding piece with effective tempo changes, nice melodic leads, wailing solos, and grumbling bass notes; and lastly, \\"Cursed We Are,\\" the record's thrashiest track, is fueled by double-kick drums and gobs of fiery, breakneck riffing.<br /><br />\\"Between Two Worlds\\" is far different than anything Immortal ever put out, so it may take some getting used to if you are a longtime fan of that band and expecting this album to continue in that vein. But even though it may not be the follow-up to \\"Sons of Northern Darkness\\" that you were expecting, there is still a lot to enjoy here. If you like music with an abundance of gripping, headbanging riffs, excellent solos, melodic hooks, infectious grooves, and memorable songs, you are sure to agree.ng rhythm and a ripping, ascending solo.

B000NIVJEU|3.0|The Blu-Ray disc of Eragon is kind of a disapointment due to the fact there is no special features of the movie no making of,no deleted scenes,no nothing.Thoe the HD picture is nice and even looked nice on my ED projector.The sound was realy nice as well.As for the movie,when I first went to see the movie when it came out I loved it,and then I was talking to people after the movie and the people I spoke to thought the movie was horrible and that Hollywood ruined the book,well I never read the book,so I decided to read the book,and then I discoverd why people hated the movie,must of the stuff that happen in the book was nowhere to be found in the movie,yeah Hollywood wrecked the Eragon novel.Yeah I still think the movie is still pretty good,but it's nowhere near as good as the book.After reading the novel I no longer love the movie.But still when the movie was being released on Blu-Ray I still decided to get it,thoe I was sad to see that Fox did not include special Features.Note the DVD version has all kinds of special features including Deleted scenes.Why Fox choose not to include the special features found on the DVD,well I dont know? Well anyways I give the movie and The Blu-Ray disc of Eragon 3 stars.Well as for the HD picture I give 4 stars.the DTS sound I give 5 stars.
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|From the opening track Rehab I knew this was going to be a great album. Winehouse has a truly soulful voice that expresses all the different moods of the genre. Besides Rehab, my favourite track is called Love Is A Losing Game, a gem of a song in the lost love tradition with a beautiful melody. Another great one is You Know I'm No Good with its powerful sax. And Me & Mr Jones is a stunner. The music gains a distinctive flavour through the use of samples from classic 1960s pop songs, while the lyrics are intelligent and mature. There is a certain authenticity to this seamless blend of funk, torch, R&B and pop music that reaches the heart and soul. And it's rare to find an album these days where every single track is memorable; Back To Black has thus been a very pleasant surprize. I am sure Winehouse wil prove to be a major talent in the years to come, judging by this excellent CD.

I actually bought this book while Christmas-shopping, it had been sitting on top of my dryer for three months. <br /> <br />With that said, this is one of those rare books that really made me stop and reflect for a while after reading it. I was able to guess at the big \\"reveal\\" a couple of paragraphs before it happened but what surprised me was the strong emotion I felt later on when Ender pulled away the mirror from the wall. The ensuing \\"conversation\\" had tears welling in my eyes. Wow! Just wow! Haven't felt a gut-punch like that since I read Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz. <br /> <br />Buy it, read it.

His restlessness and ambition, unfortunately, leads him into the world of a basically demonic figure, Narc Detective Alonzo Harris. Watch as Harris \\"trains\\" Hoyt for a day and all during that day spins a cruel web of flattery and abuse around him, breaking Hoyt down and then building him up, all the while planning Hoyt's demise. It has been a long time since I have seen such pure evil in a character as in Harris, played by Washington. This is a good movie, with excellent performances all around. Don't watch it as a crime drama, though. Look deeper.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|I saw this film when it first came out and then sometime after that.  I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that the message I got from it was the one necessarily intended, (indeed if any specific message was intended).  For what it's worth here is what I came away with:  There is a scene in an abandoned school that is falling apart and one of the characters makes the observation how its' very odd what happens in the world without children's voices.  It is in fact odd and horrific; governments have collapsed and anarchy reigns.  It appears that the only hope for humanity may be the baby being carried by a young African woman.  Michael Caine's character makes the statement that her baby is the \\"miracle\\" that the whole world has been waiting for.  The messianic tones are unmistakable.  This is further driven home when having had her baby the young mother carries her child outside and there is a cessation of hostilities between the warring factions.  I'm not sure that Mr. Cuaron, (the director), had a specific message, but I know that it seemed to me that at least on one level the film suggests that there is a sanctity and something sacred about life that perhaps we, (especially in the West), should wake-up to.  Perhaps one of the solutions for tomorrow should be a heightened respect for life as opposed to coming up with more efficient and cavalier ways of preventing it and/or extinguishing it.

B00005JPLU|2.0|Political Correctness strikes yet another symbol of virtue and strength. Pretty boys. Almost as pretty girls. Historical farce very loosley based on the delaying action fought at Thermopylae. The almost 70 year old Leonides is portrayed by a 30 something bodybuilder. He gets his wifes permissoin to make her decisions. This is a Hollywierd romance. Nothing more.    There is some good gore in the fight choreography. Sadly, even these are poorly done. Great graphics as is expected of american films today. By the way, were rhinoceri and elephants and giants used by the Iranians(Persians) at Thermopylae? And are Iranians Negroes? I ask because they are in this film.     If you're looking for a more accurate and yet entertaining account of Thermopylae and the Spartans read \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Steven Pressfield.    Avoid this movie or save your money for renting it.

B00005JPCF|1.0|Many people have an odd affinity for this movie so I wanted to make sure that everyone heard all sides of a review.  I have to start of by saying that I love animated films.  The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Cars, The Little Mermaid, and Anastasia were all movies that kept me entertained during the course of the film.  I cannot say the same about Happy Feet.  There are very few movies that I can honestly say that were boring to watch and this most certainly is one of them.  They chastised the penguin for dancing when all the penguins were actually dancing anyway.  How was he any different from the rest of the penguins?   <br /> <br />I measure a film by how much I care for the central characters.  In Happy Feet I was rooting for the sea lions to eat the penguins.  When you are rooting against the protagonist you know something is definitely wrong the film.  The story telling was sloppy and rushed in so many places, which was pretty obvious by the rushed way they ended the movie.  If you are going to spend money on a DVD get Cars because at least won't be hoping that the hero of the story dies. <br />[[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]]

0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult tackles the difficult and emotional topic of school shootings in her latest book, \\"Nineteen Minutes\\".  In just 19 minutes the lives of numerous people are turned upside down as young Peter Houghton goes to his New Hampshire high school armed with two rifles and two pistols.  Several people are killed and several more are wounded as the bullets from Peter's gun rip apart bodies and lives.  Picoult painstakingly takes the reader through flashbacks of Peter's growing-up years when he is taunted and bullied by other students because he's  different and doesn't fit in with any of the friendship groups in the school.  As always, Picoult's world is not black and white, but is filled with grays.  Peter's parents are not perfect, but neither are they portrayed as monsters who could have produced a severely antisocial son.  Picoult doesn't shrink from the truth, but she shows great compassion for the characters whom she creates.  This is a book which may make the reader think as a parent, \\"There but for the grace of God go I\\" and which will long remain in the reader's mind.
B000002UTT|5.0|I grew up in the 80's and 90's when Ace of Base, Snap!, Michael Jackson, Cranberries, Bon Jovi, Roxette and various others were huge. <br />Back then you couldn't survive as an artist unless you had some real quality music to offer, which today seems somewhat rare. <br /> <br />After the Roxette hype was over I kept listening to Roxette tapes on and off for the next decade or so- until I realized, and I remember being so amazed that almost every song I had on these tapes was a Masterpiece and instead of getting bored from repeated listening I started to love these songs more and more. <br />So I decided to buy their albums on CDs and have been a fan ever since. <br /> <br />I think all of these songs deserve more then 5 stars, all of them are brilliant! <br /> Just to name a few: \\"Paint\\" one of the most beautiful songs I ever heard, \\"Chances\\" this is Roxette's fastest song and at the same time I would say one of their top 10, considering that they made way over 100 exceptional songs this is brilliant, \\"Dance Away\\" really gets into your head, sexy how Marie sings it, \\"Shadow Of A Doubt\\" a prime example of why people love Maries voice!    <br /> <br />In my opinion it doesn't come better then Look Sharp!  <br />If I had to choose just one album in the world this would be the One. <br />Nough said. <br />

B000EQ47GS|5.0|this is about as enjoyable a listen as you'll get from the world of commercial 70's rock. just the sound of this thing is phenomenal. the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar textures with electric ones, which is made use of frequently here, is particularly appealing to the ear. tom scholz guitar playing is lyrical and emotionally powerful on these 8 songs. the stuff of arena-rock heaven. the songs themselves are uniformly fine, especially the hits \\"more than a feeling,\\" \\"peace of mind,\\" and \\"long time.\\" not really a bad or dull moment on the whole recording. i was never that big on arena-rock back in the 70's, but i always did love this album. just a fantastic, completely enjoyable outting from a group of talented musicians.
B000K1PS9C|5.0|First of all, this book is not some trivial, New Age potboiler. This is the third time that I have read it cover-to-cover and I have found it to be quite satisfying and believable.<br /><br />I know some people are going to automatically reject it because it relies on hypnotherapy. They are going to assume that the hypnotist implanted false memories among his clients. At the very least, they are going to claim that networking between the 29 clients covered in these case studies resulted in the remarkable consistency among them. This does not appear to be the case. The author holds a Ph.D. in counseling and is a state-certified Master Hypnotherapist. He is aware of the common criticisms and he makes a believable case for why they do not apply in his work. I believed him.<br /><br />The overall consistency between the 29 cases is remarkable. Different terminology and symbolism is occasionally used but it is obvious that the same things are being described. What we have is an orderly picture of classification of soul development and of the structure of the spiritual world. It is remarkably similar to that described in different language over the millennia by shamans, the Vedas, the Platonists, the Gnostics. It also reminds one of the experiences of Robert Monroe and of George Meek in more modern times. Yet, you do not get the impression that the author or his subjects were overly familiar with these teachings at the time of the sessions. It is like the spontaneous symbolism that Jung described as arising from the collective unconscious; only in this case the source is the hyperconscious- the realm of soul guides.<br /><br />We forfeit our physical body after death but our eternal life energy unites with the force of a divine oversoul in an orderly progression. Our soul reflects a small portion of this oversoul that we call God.

B000MZHW40|4.0|Hollywood's attempts at social conscience films in the past several years have been self-indulgent, fractured narratives tailored for self-congratulatory Academy Awards shows. They're barely watchable, much less entertaining. \\"Blood Diamond\\" is a welcome exception. An action film with attractive, involving characters and memorable -though unoriginal- dialogue, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is set in Sierra Leone in 1999, during the country's bloody civil war in which the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) murdered, maimed, and displaced millions in its attempt to control and profit from the nation's diamond fields.<br /><br />Mercenary soldier Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) smuggles diamonds from Sierra Leone into Liberia, where they eventually make their way into the vaults of the world's largest diamond conglomerate Van de Kaap. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman forced to work in the diamond fields when his village was ravaged by the RUF. When both men are briefly held in the same jail in Freetown, Danny learns that Solomon has hidden a large pink diamond. Danny needs to reimburse his commander for a lost shipment, so he promises Solomon help in finding his family in exchange for the location of the stone. At the same time, he implores American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) for assistance in exchange for damning information on the diamond trade.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou is a powerful, empathetic presence throughout \\"Blood Diamond\\", and Jennifer Connelly makes Maddy's sense of adventure, bravery, and commitment to her beliefs infectious. But it is Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of sharp, wounded, resourceful Danny Archer that pulls the audience into this film. Danny's unyielding determination to survive, his relentless motion in the direction of necessity is \\"Blood Diamond\\"'s driving force. DiCaprio deserved the praise he received for this performance. The extended sequence of the RUF's assault on Freetown is one of the most memorable depictions of war that I've seen on film. My hat is off to director Edward Zwick, cinematographer Eduardo Serra, and production designer Dan Weil for this surreal spectacle.<br /><br />The civil war in Sierra Leone ended in 2002, and there are now considerably fewer conflict diamonds than in the 1990s. So in some ways this film is old news. But conflict diamonds, which are used to finance violent revolutionary movements and general mayhem, are still very much an issue among human rights activists and critics of the diamond industry. It may be inevitable that the politics of \\"Blood Diamond\\" are murky, since the events it depicts are impenetrable. The filmmakers are obviously trying to raise awareness about what one may be subsidizing in purchasing diamonds. But Van de Kaap is an unveiled stand-in for De Beers, and it isn't clear to me what the film wants to say about them. Van de Kaap buys conflict diamonds in order to control the price of diamonds on the world market. But Van de Kaap also supports the mercenary army hired to rout out the RUF. In spite of their representative being a rich, smarmy white man, I'm not sure that this makes Van de Kaap a villain. But then De Beers' relationship to conflict diamonds has never been clear.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Bros. 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition of the DVD are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Edward Zwick. Zwick discusses Sierra Leone's history and politics, but not as much as I would have liked and not enough to clear up the nebulous points in the plot. He does talk about the cultural connections between Sierra Leone and the Western world, the plight of the child soldiers, and how he approached depicting real events. Zwick also addresses the challenges of filming, cinematography, how he got the necessary exposition into the film, and filming on location in Mozambique and South Africa. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.

Chip and Dan Heath have managed to write a book about common principals: Simplicity,Unexpectedness,Concreteness,Credibility,Emotions and Stories, aka,<br /><br />SUCCES.<br /><br />Wow, revolutionary! These are principals of sales managers,writers, real estate agents, teachers, you name it, the brothers Heath have just managed to apply an acronym to these \\"DUH!\\" factors.<br /><br />This was a tough read, I found myself nodding off mid chapter. There is no new ground broken here, just a rehashing of ideas and strategies that are<br /><br />commonly applied in everyday life, from the most successful entrepreneur to the soccer mom.<br /><br />I realize I'm not being fair by reviewing a book I didn't finish reading, but to Chip and Dan I dispense this simple advise. N.T.M.I.S.....Next time, make it stick.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion for the most part is a delightful read.  I actually belly-laughed at Dawkins' witty put-downs of ecclesiastical nonsense.  Dawkins' approach is also very thorough.  <br /> <br />Dawkins shows explicitly the Old Testament's barbarity; he explicates the origins of morality as having nothing to do with religion; and he speculates as to the evolutionary reasons for religious belief (although he and others risk making evolutionary psychology into a parlor game, for many of its assertions, while plausible,  are unfalsifiable). <br /> <br />However, when it comes to certain issues, Dawkins' scientific training falls into a wait-state.  <br /> <br />1. Professor Dawkins repeats the BBC's claim that President Bush said God told him to invade Iraq.  (Dawkins' doesn't mention Mr. Blair's or Mr. Howard's reasoning; presumably they were channeled by God through Mr. Bush.)  <br /> <br />In 2005, the White House officially denied that Mr. Bush made such a statement. Now, in the civilized world and parts of Scotland, a denial also serves as a \\"just-in-case-I-misspoke\\" retraction. But doncha see, in Mr. Bush's case, the BBC and Richard will have none of it.  They gleefully prefer having Mr. Bush hearing voices. <br /> <br />2.   Dawkins correctly trashes the silly syllogism: Stalin was an atheist; Stalin was evil; therefore, atheists tend to be evil.  But then he repeats, calling it \\"striking,\\" Sam Harris's similar syllogism: Religious folk in the US tend to vote Republican; Red states (states that went into Bush's column in the 2004 election) have higher crime rates; therefore, states with large religious populations tend to be less socially healthy than other states; and, of course, religious people by inference are more criminally active or more tolerant of criminality (it's not clear which) than nonreligious people; QED.  (Both Harris and Dawkins use some weasel words to soften their endorsements of the above syllogism; nevertheless, the QED isclearly their intent.) <br /> <br />A high school sophomore might ask, oh, I don't know, say:  <br /> <br />*Wasn't there a mass migration in the US from blue to red states over the last 60 years?  <br />*Why did BMW, Daimler, Nissan and Toyota build huge auto factories in the socially unhealthy red states?   <br />*Might not criminal types follow the money and also have secondary thoughts about religious people as being mentally slower (as does Daniel Dennett), naïve and trusting and therefore easy pickings? <br />*Red states being low-tax states, is there perhaps less public money available for the instruments of public safety?   <br /> <br />On reflection, I should think Richard would be a bit embarrassed by his endorsement of Sam Harris's syllogism. <br /> <br />3.  Dawkins points to polls in the US that show Americans to a very great extent believe in a personal god.  He presents no similar polls for Europeans, but presumably they would show dramatically fewer such believers.   <br /> <br />Here again, Dawkins' natural curiosity evanesces, for he fails to investigate the fact that in the US, especially in the Sun Belt, it is still socially permissible to voice one's religious belief, but in Europe, and especially the UK, it is definitely bad form.  It has been shown numerous times that in polling, such socially dicey issues translate into bad polls; i.e., perhaps in their inner sancta, Europeans hold the same views, but fear expressing them to pollsters. <br /> <br />4. Toward the end of his book, Dawkins becomes decidedly unglued.  He admits to trolling the Internet looking for outrageous statements by religious nutballs.  And he makes the surprising logical error of finding an outrageous statement from the leader of a religious group and then inferring that the leader's thinking was mainstream in the US because there were millions of members in the organization.   <br /> <br />5.  Dawkins also makes the same error (as does Sam Harris) for which he criticizesPascal: he roughs up Pascal for implying belief was an act of will; however, Dawkins strongly implies by means of a vigorous slapping-around of Kurt Wise that coming to disbelieve is also an act of will.  It's as though one can believe one day, be shown the vacuity of one's belief the next day, and accept, with a palm-stroke to the forehead, atheism the third day. <br /> <br />*** <br />One cannot help but feel that Dawkins' overall thrust justifies a reader's coming to the conclusion that Dawkins would be not at all unhappy if the first questions asked by the Senate of a Supreme Court nominee were: Have you ever belonged or do you now belong to any organization that professes a belief in the supernatural?  If so, do you also believe in the inerrancy of any literature promoting such belief?   <br /> <br />An affirmative answer to either question would automatically disqualify the candidate.  (We are amazingly close to such questioning, for many Senators now consider being a Roman Catholic as automatically disqualifying.) <br /> <br />Nevertheless, even with the above lapses, The God Delusion is highly recommended.  <br />
B00005JN0T|3.0|There's a lot of food for thought in this film. We might be getting very close to the type of robot pictured here -- search for \\"marshall brain robot\\" on the web to find a good starting place on the future of robotics, and the implications for society. Among those implications are massive unemployment -- an issue only lightly touched on in this movie. Remember the scene with the FedEx robot driver? Very plausible, and that won't be the only job taken over by automation.  But unfortunately, these issues were glossed over in favor of a cliched action story. And the issues were further obscured by the enormous ego of Will Smith. This film was primarily a vehicle for him to show off his buff bod, act cooler than everyone around him, and intimidate hapless men of lighter pigmentation. These have all become familiar facets of his movies, so that a Will Smith drinking game would be quite easy to construct.  Again, this movie could have been much more had it focused less on Smith's ego, and more on the promises -- and problems -- of the coming robotic revolution.
1567184855|5.0|First of all, this book is not some trivial, New Age potboiler. This is the third time that I have read it cover-to-cover and I have found it to be quite satisfying and believable.<br /><br />I know some people are going to automatically reject it because it relies on hypnotherapy. They are going to assume that the hypnotist implanted false memories among his clients. At the very least, they are going to claim that networking between the 29 clients covered in these case studies resulted in the remarkable consistency among them. This does not appear to be the case. The author holds a Ph.D. in counseling and is a state-certified Master Hypnotherapist. He is aware of the common criticisms and he makes a believable case for why they do not apply in his work. I believed him.<br /><br />The overall consistency between the 29 cases is remarkable. Different terminology and symbolism is occasionally used but it is obvious that the same things are being described. What we have is an orderly picture of classification of soul development and of the structure of the spiritual world. It is remarkably similar to that described in different language over the millennia by shamans, the Vedas, the Platonists, the Gnostics. It also reminds one of the experiences of Robert Monroe and of George Meek in more modern times. Yet, you do not get the impression that the author or his subjects were overly familiar with these teachings at the time of the sessions. It is like the spontaneous symbolism that Jung described as arising from the collective unconscious; only in this case the source is the hyperconscious- the realm of soul guides.<br /><br />We forfeit our physical body after death but our eternal life energy unites with the force of a divine oversoul in an orderly progression. Our soul reflects a small portion of this oversoul that we call God.

B000FP2OPY|4.0|Supernatural exceeded my expectations in the first season. At first I was a bit cynical as there had been many other shows that had tried the supernatural angle and failed, but this series has been a surprising hit. The storylines are always compelling, and a mixture of ghostly phenomena, apparitions, and even urban myths. The acting is well above average. We have the older Winchester brother played excellently by Jensen Ackles, and the younger brother Sam, played by Gilmore Girls alum, Jared Padalecki. Both characters portray their struggles & inner conflicts really well, and the two main leads share a genuine on-screen chemistry, making us sympathise with their plight in trying to locate their father.<br /><br />There is also a unique quality to this series...the dark storylines juxtaposed with the humor & wit contained within the dialogues...it makes for enjoyable viewing every episode!
B00005JLD4|5.0|I recently watched this film again when we showed it to a group of fifth and sixth graders who will be visiting Australia this summer.  The actions and attitudes expressed by the Australians in the film mirror those by some in the U.S. toward our American Indian tribes.  The removal of half-caste aboriginal children from their families only ceased in 1970.<br /><br />The acting by the children is unforced and excellent.  Kenneth Branagh takes on and succeeds in a difficult role.
0810993139|5.0|The world has not yet invented a method of finding the best webcomics currently available on the Internet for kids. So basically, for every twenty low-quality/poorly thought out amalgamations of crap, you get one bright shining star. \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,\\" the webcomic, was one such star. The only conclusion I can really draw at this point is that somebody at Abrams is a friggin' genius for plucking the comic up and making it into a book. Now normally I don't like to separate titles into \\"girl books\\" and \\"boy books\\", but Jeff Kinney has written such a marvelous \\"boy book\\" that for every parent that walks in the door of my library I'm going to be cramming this title into their arms. Heck, I'll slip it into their purses if I have to. This book is going to reach its intended audience whether I have to wrestle skeptical parents to the floor with it clamped firmly in my teeth. Want to transfer your Captain Underpants lovers from graphic novels to fiction? This book won't do that. It's just something that every single person will get a kick out of.<br /><br />First things first. Boys do not have diaries. Girls have diaries. Let's get that straight cause things could get messy if we don't. Basically, what we have here are the gathered thoughts and memories of Greg Haffley. Greg's got a pretty average life, all things considered. His older brother is a jerk, his younger brother annoying, his best friend a doofus, and his parents perfect dweebs. To top it all off, Greg's been thrown into his first year of middle school and things are really weird. Suddenly friendships are shifting and Greg's not sure who he wants to be. Add in some haunted houses, wrestling, downhill games involving bodily injury, forbidden cheese, and basic family fears and you've got yourself one heckuva debut.<br /><br />I should specify that in spite of the fact that this book is based on a webcomic, it's not a graphic novel. Not really. Comic illustrations appear on every single page and complement the storytelling, but this is really more a (what's the term again?) illustrated novel. What this appears to be, more than anything else, is a notebook that's been written in by hand with the occasional cartoony illustration here and there for effect. It never breaks up into panels or long illustrated periods. There are just tasty little comic treats on each and every page.<br /><br />Now the term \\"laugh-out-loud funny\\" is not to be bandied about. When I say that something is \\"laugh-out-loud funny\\" I don't want to be talking titters, mild chuckles, or undersized, underfed guffaws. I want to describe something so amusing that you think about it later and start laughing in an embarrassing manner on the subway. Jeff Kinney gave me that more than once. There was the moment when Greg's trying to get out of performing as an apple-throwing tree in his school's production of, \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" He thinks that maybe if he screws up what he has to say, that might be his out. \\"But when you only have one word to say, it's really hard to mess up your lines.\\" The next thing we know, \\"Dorothy\\" has picked an apple and Greg's trying out a tentative, \\"Owwwchhh?\\" Oh! And the form thank you letters! Greg figures out that he says basically the same thing to all his relatives. So he just cranks out a form letter and fills in the details. This works great until he gets to something like, \\"Dear AUNT LORETTA, Thank you so much for the awesome PANTS! How did you now I wanted that for Christmas? I love the way the PANTS looks on my LEGS! All my friends will be so jealous that I have my very own PANTS.\\" I think I was laughing over this for a good three hours after I read it.<br /><br />There's something particularly charming about Kinney's illustration/cartoons too. The lines are incredibly clean and precise, even as they are showing some pretty raucous stuff. Kinney's grasp on visual gags is without comparison. At one point Greg happens to mention that if you \\"mess up in front of Dad\\" (i.e. kick over your little brother's toys maliciously) he'll throw whatever he has in his hands at you. We then see two shots of Greg misbehaving. The first is labeled, \\"GOOD TIME TO SCREW UP:\\" and shows him kicking over some blocks while his dad is holding the newspaper. The second reads, \\"BAD TIME TO SCREW UP:\\" and shows him doing it while his dad is cementing together a brick wall. Comedy gold, people! The comics are drawn over lined paper, making the whole enterprise really feel as if you're poring through someone else's journal.<br /><br />And for all that, the writing's not too shabby. When Greg talks about week-ends he says, \\"The only reason I get out of bed at all on weekends is because eventually, I can't stand the taste of my own breath anymore.\\" Been there. Tasted that. Kinney's able to point out all kinds of funny school details we adults may have forgotten, but that kids will recognize instantly. For example, why should you tell kids that \\"It's great to be you,\\" when a lot of people really should think about changing themselves? We see two bullies shoving some poor kid down at this point yelling, \\"It's great to be me!,\\" you you have to concede the point. I mean, Kinney remembers what it was like to roll a really big snowball and then see that you were ripping up the grass on your lawn in the process. No one remembers that! Characters are also lovingly delineated, not only in words, but in their little comic illustrations. Take as your example the character of Greg's fellow student and neighbor Fregley. Fregley is weird. So how would you, as the writer/cartoonist, convey this? You might want to have him say things like, \\"Wanna see my secret freckle?\\". You might draw him with a mouth wider than his head. You might have him stabbing kites in his front yard, shirtless. For a start, anyway. Every character in this book feels real. Even Greg's annoying, practically mute, little brother.<br /><br />And so much more. Such as the name of Greg's older brother's band. Loaded Diaper, only it's spelled \\"Loded Diper\\" with an umlaut over the \\"o\\". Greg suspects his brother thinks that it really is spelled that way. And there are the small failures and triumphs of your average pre-adolescent. No one in their right mind would ever want to return to the days of Middle School, but if Jeff Kinney keeps churning out books like this one, I'll follow him there any day of the week. This title has already been getting some pretty choice reviews here and there. Can I make a nomination for funniest children's book of 2007?

Recommended.
0143034901|5.0|I read all 487 pages in less than a day, which has to be a record for me.  I can't remember the last time I was so entranced by a book that I couldn't get away from it.  This has to be one of the best fiction novels I have read.<br /><br />This novel is wonderfully intriguing with intricate plot twists and turns that kept me dying to know where the story was going next.  The plot was clever and well-archetected all the way to the end of the novel, and never disappointing.  I have read Perez-Reverte (The Club Dumas, The Flanders Panel) in the past and thought the plots in those books were very well executed, but I enjoyed this book even more and thought it was a bit easier and more colorful to read.<br /><br />Although I haven't read the original Spanish version, I thought that the translation was well-done because of the selection of wording.  The translator must have paid meticulous attention to the words chosen as they really painted the setting and scenes well and drew me into the story as if I were there.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy books by foreign authors that take place in a foreign city because it's like having a small window into that world, which is another reason I completely devoured this book.  I don't think readers have to feel that way to enjoy it, but the setting does create an intriguing backdrop.<br /><br />I'm glad I purchased this one because I plan to recommend it to friends and loan it out (but they'd better return it!).
B000068FWC|5.0|I bought this because I found myself really enjoying any Supertramp that I picked up on the satellite radio.  I realized I didn't have this CD -- or the record -- remember them?  This music still holds up.  There is only one song that I forward through, still.  Everything else is fun to listen to, brings back interesting memories, and plays very well on a powerful stereo.  It should be a part of every forty-ishes arsenal of tunes.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|No, this movie is not as bad as the stinker in the title. It is similar as it does have serious continuity problems. First of all this is a prequel, and set in 2006??? Secondly, Judi Dench's M is in charge and Bond got his 00 status at the beginning of the movie??????? Absolutely no sense to this. <br /> <br />The other problem is that this Bond is not a good guy. He is a thug, no better then the criminals in this movie. <br /> <br />So why three stars instead of the zero stars it should probably get? Because if you forget this is a Bond movie, it is fairly enjoyable. Even though this movie falls flat, I am glad they tried something new, the Bond formula is beyond tired. Hopefully next time they can find a reasonable storyline and a good Bond.

0375704027|4.0|I love Murakami and honestly believe he is one of the five best writers alive today. I've come to love his off-beat plotlines and the way he creates worlds   that combine our reality with off-beat ones. When I heard about this book I was apprehensive about reading something many described as a somewhat conventional love story. But as is always the case with his fiction (and I guess 4 million readers can't all be wrong), \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is a gem.  <br /> <br />The story follows Toru Watanabe, a middle-aged man who hears the Beatles song that gives the book its name and is transported back to the end of his teenage years. He recounts his early years as part of a trio consisting of his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend. Tragedy strikes when his friend commits suicide and its impact defines the rest of the story. Toru comes across as being a familiar yet unfamiliar character - he's the outsider who is liked by people who find themselves as the center of attention in whatever social groups they are a part of. As the story continues, Toru falls in love with Naoko, his best friend's girlfriend, but is unable to pursue anything because of the lasting trauma of Kizuki's death.  <br /> <br />As conventional as main plot may come across, Murakami as always finds a way to infuse the story with wonderful details and slightly odd twists and turns that make the whole experience one not to be missed. Although the book does not live up to \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\\" it's still a delectable read.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I am tired of these supposedly smart movies. Oh Pulp Fiction was a gem when it came out in 1994. In Babel the stories are simple and not that dramatic. For me it was just paining to drag it out any longer. Because of a lack of individual character development, I just didn't feel much for any of them. That can suck if that is exactly the motive of a movie such as in Babel. No I'm not a bad person its just that Babel is a movie and movies need to draw you in. Its not like I would be fine with these things happening in my own life. <br />As for the music and scenery, its OK, but this is a movie and not a musical piece or work of art. It seems like not all the components are present to make a good film. Babel seems overrated and I wonder if this has anything to do with Brad Pitt being in it? At the least, I think the title works quite well for the film.
0743496728|3.0|Jodi Picoult's books are all starting to run together in my mind.  Her best, I believe, was My Sister's Keeper.  But I kept feeling while reading Nineteen Minutes that she covered this material elsewhere.  Her stories are becoming formulaic.  If you want to read a haunting novel about school shootings, read \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\", a truly amazing, memorable, gut wrenching book.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Oh yeah. Ripley as the Orkin Man. This is the version with the extra dialog, softening her up a bit. It was a bit noticeable, but I've seen this about 50 times so it was more apparent to me. It was actually kind of good because it made her transformation all the more logical. The movie is rip roaring great on all levels. The bugs are on screen much more than in Alien, and the momma bug is a sight to see. The two momma figures battling it out over their progeny (sort of) is truly great (\\"leave her alone, you beotch!\\" being a highlight). Special effects are good, Sigourney Weaver is good, Bill Paxton as the coward is excellent, livening things up a bit.<br /><br />This movie is in a different category than Alien, the first movie, but as itself it is still great entertainment.
B000001FS6|5.0|This cd contains live versions of earlier tracks and new studio tracks. <br />It also contains new tracks but in their live versions. <br />I will not rate this cd songs by songs, I will only tell you that I just love this one and review some of them. <br />The voice of Bono in \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" is simply amazing. <br />I just love \\"Angel of Harlem\\", very good songs ! \\"Love rescue me\\" is highly emotionnal, \\"When love comes to town\\" is a very good blues track with B.B.King, \\"Heartland\\" and \\"God part II\\" are great and \\"All I want is you\\" is one of my favorite U2 songs.  A must have cd.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|This Bond movie was a big disappointment. I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.  A lot of people complained about the Bond time line in this movie, but you got to realize that it's hard to work with since Bond has been around for like 50 years, so this is negligible.  Compared to the recent Bond movies with Brosnan, this movie was just not up to par.  Though there were plenty of action scenes, they were not at all explosive.  The car chase in the movie was extremely short, and also the end fight in the movie was not impressive.  Though Craig Daniel is by no means a bad Bond, he's not nearly as good as Brosnan, Connery, and Moore.  He doesn't have that charm/mojo that the other guys had when it comes to women.  Also, he seems a bit too buff for Bond.  I just hope that the next Bond movies will do a little more to accomodate today's crowd.
0060090383|4.0|This is only the second book I've read by Marian Keyes but like \\"Anybody out there?\\" it manages to be funny while handling a very serious topic.<br /><br />Rachel finds her life turned upside-down when her sister, Margaret, arrives in NYC and takes her home to Ireland.  Her parents along with her sister, Helen, take her on to a rehabilitation home.  Rachels knows she is not an addict, and only agrees to go because she wants to meet the celebrities that take their vacations at the \\"spa\\".<br /><br />Ms. Keyes writes with a great deal of feeling and empathy.  I recommend this book highly!

B000001FTQ|4.0|Thsi is just a mini CD, but it contains the best Live version of \\"Bad\\" and \\"A sort of Homecoming\\" that you can find.  The drum on \\"A sort of homecoming\\" is simply amazing.

B000NA28I4|1.0|The best characters in the book were Brom and Saphira. However, in the brief time of two hours, the creators of this movie managed to ruin even that good the book might have had. Saphira was the one good thing about the movie. Her character was generally kept to its best ability and for the most part, I did not mind her. (not to mention that baby Saphira was rather cute) The good of the movie ended with that CGI character. <br /> <br />Brom was changed from a nice, old storyteller to a grump old man who keeps to himself and disobeys the king. His relationship with the Varden is difficult to understand and for the most part, although I have read that he is the only one who can act, his character is ruined by a bad script. He is shown as training Eragon in nothing one scene with them fighting with swords and one with magic) and whoever watches the movie cannot tell if him killing Morzan is a good thing or a bad thing. It sounds bad. <br /> <br />The book is a nearly 800 page book (paperback). When making this size of book into a movie, people run into the problem about what to put in and what to keep out. The problem is the creators of this movie tried to to put nearly everything into it. This led to a very quick moving movie but so quick moving that it seemed difficult to understand, especially to someone who has not read the book. The easiest way to discribe it as is, if you want a slight background of the book, watch the movie, but don't talk about the book like you know it if you have only seen the movie. I am right now having problems thinking of something that they could not get wrong from the book to the movie, from something as simple as the king is not ever shown in the book, to the color of the shade's hair and the gateway thing on Eragon's hand. Drop the king, drop the flashbacks, and then they might be able to explain more, but as far as it goes, the movie is a total waste. <br /> <br />I pity Chrisopher Paolini for getting his name attached to this movie.Expect nothing from it. Don't bother to buy it because my twelve-year-old sister who watches everything else won't even watch it again. Rent it if you want to see it. It's not worth your 17 dollars. And if you so desperately want to know about the book, get it on CD or something.  <br /> <br />Morality--No foul language, no kissing (and only eluded to romance), little blood. However, the scenes with the king and the shade are very, very dark, lighting wise, which is slightly bothersome.
B00005JPLU|5.0|OK I saw \\"300\\" - I don't go for the movies most people buzz over, and even though the HYPE surrounding was to omnipresent I was sure to be left unsatisfied, I was curious... I enjoy a good blood bath now and then. HERE IS MY REVIEW. <br /> <br />THEY ALL SAY THIS MOVIE \\"SETS THE BAR\\", THEY ALL SAY THAT IT IS \\"STUNNING TO WATCH\\".  <br />Well... for ONCE they say correct. <br /> <br />I thought this film had remarkable artistry and vision that left the viewer in awe. A HUGE HUGE ACHIEVEMENT IN FILM MAKING FOLKS. One notable scene is a seamless shots of the protagonist steadily advancing through 20 opponants.... in the background his men are doing the same.  The director takes you out of the realm of earthly reality and says to you... \\"this is the world I have created...you'd better believe it\\" and you really do.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the era of using dummies, splicing and editing tricks to achieve beheadings is long past... wait 'til you see the realism of running men losing limbs while attacking... entirely different use of computer technology than predecessors such as \\"Kill Bill\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". I also dislike that cheap sped-up effect in films like \\"Gladiator\\"....better use of film speed here. nice! <br />All in all, this movie LIVES UP TO ALL THE HYPE SURROUNDING IT... something I never see personally (except for \\"An Insignifacant Truth\\" which also did).
B00014NE62|5.0|Forget that the movie stars a very young Hugh Grant, who is infinitely cute.  Even without him, this is a compelling purchase.  The adaption from the novel is quite true, the acting measured and believable, and the plots turns interesting and unpredictable.  For the romantic seekig a happy ending, it may not be the ending you seek, but I can guarantee you will be satisfied at the end. And, it is an excellent reminder that draconian prejudice and intolerance are not all that far back in our collective pasts.

B000HEWEE4|3.0|When I saw the preview for this film, I kept thinking that it was a rip-off of \\"Just Like Heaven,\\" but it is actually based on a Korean film. Nevertheless, there are some strong similarities between \\"The Lake House\\" and \\"Heaven.\\" Both are supernatural tales about fate and the inevitability of true love, and how love can transcend the material world of here and now.<br /><br />\\"Just Like Heaven\\" was based on a book written by Marc Levy. In the book, the male protagonist is an architect who falls in love with the spirit of a female doctor. In the film version, the male lead (Marc Ruffalo) is a landscape architect and the female (Reese Witherspoon) remains a doctor. In \\"The Lake House,\\" Keanu Reeves plays an architect who develops a relationship with a doctor (Sandra Bullock) by sending her mail that goes through a timewarp. Is all this similarity a coincidence?<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the story, direction, acting, cinematography and even the music came together to make a near masterpiece in \\"Just Like Heaven,\\" the same cannot be said for \\"The Lake House.\\"<br /><br />Although Keanu Reeves is fine, Sandra Bullock is miscast and there doesn't seem to be any real chemistry between the two. There is something a bit too hard and un-feminine about Ms. Bullock. Watching her, I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Christopher Guest's character in Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel. And when mail arrives in the Lake House's magic mailbox, the little red flag pops up in a way that is almost unintentionally funny. (I'm being kind when I say \\"almost\\".)<br /><br />Even the film's \\"love theme\\" - Paul McCartney's \\"This Never Happened Before\\" - doesn't seem to fit well at the various points in the movie that it is played.<br /><br />Despite it's problems, \\"The Lake House\\" is still worth watching. In the right hands, this could have turned out to be a much, much better film.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|Pretty good film -- although it is (as you might expect) quite violent.  The convoluted and multi layered plot seems to lead to a bit of needless confusion -- perhaps the KISS principal would have worked better.  Doesn't accurately track the Whitey Bolger career -- he escaped and is believed to be alive -- but I am sure the \\"modifications\\" were to achieve a greater dramatic impact.  I actually liked \\"Blood Diamond\\" better, but this is definitely worth buying.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This is a wonderful movie. It is a great story with a lot of adventure.
B000LC55F2|3.0|A try hard provocative look at \\"obsession\\", where friendly competition evolves into a rivelry of one upmanship. Its fusion of science and magic left me intrigued until the end. Disjoined plot twists detracted from the central character development as I wanted to bond with each to better feel their motivations. The ending was lack lustre on two fronts, rooted as it was in the realism that one bullet stops all and secondly, that scientific phenonmena which lack explanation is just science fiction. I would have preferred an ending either, a profound questioning around the central themes  or a sugar coasted Capra ending (I'm still hung up on \\"Its a Wonderlife Life\\"). In all.. entertaining and worth the purchase.

B0000DDAU9|5.0|Its easy to see where Mastodon have gotten their elevated status above most modern metal acts; with cleverly woven hooks, plenty of diversity that never is over-done, and an ear for devastating heaviness, Mastodon's 'Remission' fits in perfectly with the genious of their later efforts. Besides putting on an extremely intense live show, Mastodon offer a relentless barrage of originality served with a side dish of extra-heavy grooves on all of their releases, including 'Remission'.<br /><br />'March of the Fire Ants' was the first song I had ever heard by these guys, on the Relapse Records compilation 'Contaminated Vol.5', and needless to say, I was thouroughly attracted to the songs intricate structure and heaviness, accompanied with that deep, crunchy distortion that this album potrays. The entire album is chock filled with songs that vary beautifully from each other, but not so much to give this album a too diverse feel. This is, after all, heavy metal. All are heavy, and all have that gut wrenching groove that is strictly Mastodon's.<br /><br />If you loved 'Levathian', and/or 'Blood Mountian' then you damn well better get this.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|\\"No, no no!\\" This was no doubt my most common reaction to what I saw in this film. Rewritten with a total disdain of the mood and theme of the original epic, this movie take instead decides to show a groveling, nose-wiping Nordic culture, where everyone save the couple of women in the film are cheap, below-the-belt people. Even Beowulf himself is shown to be an overweight braggart, and Hrothgar, an honorable model for a king in the epic, is a mead-oozing disaster zone.<br /><br />Added are a couple of meaningless characters, an Irish priest who provides a sneering look towards Dark-Age Christianity, and a witch-woman who is of course a completely misunderstood, sensitive person. Can anyone say stereotypes?<br /><br />Grendel is the worst part of the film: a 'troll', really nothing more than a slightly taller man who cannot speak language, supposedly very hairy but really no more so than any number of Danes or Geats! This movie nonsensically decides to portray Grendel (the \\"God-cursed brute\\", \\"monster\\", etc.) as ANOTHER misunderstood soul, mellow and loyal toward his 'family'... I say, what? Indeed. A pitiful lack of special effects makes him no more than a tall man with fake hair all over his body. His performance is anything but memorable.<br /><br />From a technical aspect, this movie is horrible. I don't care what your tastes are, it is pathetically filmed. bad camera angles, bad setup, and terrible light metering. Most of the film is underexposed, while its bright moments are too bright. Continuity is just as bad as you might expect given the general lack of skill here, and dialogue is right awful - accents are unrefined; not exactly bad, but there are many lines that are just unintelligible.<br /><br />All in all, nearly everything in this story is retold in cheap-postmodern-novel form, with a dispensing of the fresh and dynamic Christianity of the original (made the more interesting for pieces of its character still echoing the pagan days) for a silly modern neo-paganism, most unauthentic, as wicca so often is, and it goes so far as to bash the Christian religion multiple times. This is a film which has no loyalty to the classic story beloved by many for not decades, not centuries, but a millenium.<br /><br />I am not a complainer by nature; if you take a look at my other reviews you'll see that this is so. But I must open my mouth when it comes to this one. If you want to experience Beowulf in the form that made it what it is, find poet Seamus Heaney's recital of his excellent verse translation on compact disk. That is the best Beowulf out there, short of the Anglo-Saxon we don't speak.modern neo-paganism, most unauthentic, as wicca so often is, and it goes so far as to bash the Christian religion multiple times.

B00003CWNR|2.0|A basically dishonest movie, lacking the courage of its convictions. This oscar-winning movie is in favor of illegal abortion, adultery, law breaking, disobedience of authority, yet it is shot in soft focus, like a Capra, feel-good movie!. The constant references to Dickens are more wishful than actual; old Charles would most likely be against all the values this film celebrate.
0060776757|5.0|but it's a lot more, it's a coffeetable book and the story of a band that has kept the core members together for almost 30 years. It is like \\"Anthology\\" but all the band members were alive to tell the story. Pink Floyd \\"Inside Out\\" (which had Nick tell the story, but Roger and David edited, so it is essentially the official band bio) and the Rolling Stones (and Bill Wyman separately) have also told the tale. I like how the Elvis and Bob Dylan scrapbooks are laid out with reproductions, and wish U2 had gone that route with this book.  <br /> <br />I think it's great to go back and be able to see and hear (even on You Tube) the massive amount of footage dating back to 1978(!) that deserve a video retrospective that is as big as this book. \\"Classic Albums\\" on DVD \\"Joshua Tree\\" serves as a nice diversion from the book when they get up to that era.  <br /> <br />Crank up the music, watch the videos, and have a nice read.
B0002W4SWC|2.0|This 2001 film is a horrifying example of a chick movie. I admit that I mildly liked it when I first saw it on 2001. However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. It is besides the point to argue who is the best guy for her. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman. I want to believe that this is not true, but unfortunately, the huge success of this film shows that many women agree with that judgment. (in order to not be totally negative about this movie, let me say that the sequel is way worse).
B000JK8OYU|5.0|We went to the Mirage in Vegas to see the show, prior to buying the CD.

Even the seat headrests have speakers in them. <br /> <br />What a wonderful mix done by Sir George. I will never forget it. This is nostalgia extremis. I love it.
0618084746|5.0|This is simply one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  It catches the rhythm of life for the lonely 'invisible' people, and its emotion is conveyed so forcefully that the tragedy becomes cathartic.  Buy this book.
0439813786|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The story is great but the illustrations sell this book.  I enjoyed how they weaved into the story line and kept it moving along.  Sometimes you find yourself racing through the pictures to find out what happens next in the story.  When I finished the book I went back and looked more closely at the illustrations. This is a great book for children and adults.
B00005NVDF|5.0|A classic must have for any Woody Allen fan, especially fans of his early work. The movie cleverly incorporates Humphrey Bogart (indistinguishable from the real Bogart)as his character in 'Casablanca' (where this Woody Allen movie derives its title) tutoring an inept, timid Allen in the arts of wooing.  The movie brilliantly incorporates Bogart and 'Casablanca' into the script, including key quotes and even ending with the same final scene. A Woody Allen masterpiece.[[ASIN:0792846117 Sleeper]][[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]]
0312979479|3.0|One of the major problems with this book, is that it did not live up to the hype. Supposedly, Agatha Christie is this awesome mystery writer who writes all these amazing books. Granite, the premise of the book is quite interesting. All the murders are based on a children's poem- the order in which they happen and the method. It is a shame that Christie could not deliver on such a surprisingly novel idea.<br /><br />Also, her lack of \\"clues\\" in a mystery book was disappointing. I would like to try the solve the mystery myself, but since I was given so few clues, I was not able too.<br /><br />The book is not all together a bad book, but its not too good either.

033041836X|5.0|After reading The Lovely Bones and coming across this book I thought I'd give it a whirl. Am I ever glad I did. Alice Sebold is such a strong and amazing woman. Her story captivated me. I was impressed with her work in The Lovely Bones, but she took it to a whole new level with Lucky. Her details, so raw and real made me feel as if I knew her, even more so as if I too was experiencing the events she was going through. She didn't hesitate for a moment to reveal details about the rape. It was hard for me to take at times, to grasp what this man was doing to her, beating her and stripping her of everything she was is mind boggling. Sebold wrote so her readers would understand; they wouldn't be sheltered with rose colored glasses or sugar coating, not a detail was left out. I'm amazed by her strength and courage throughout the entire time span. The way she faced her rapist in court, the things she went through to win is bravery at its best. After everything she lost through the rape and trial, I felt for her after reading about the devastating years post-trial. Alice Sebold gets my five stars and endless applause for her courageous tale and her triumph in finding herself in the end.
0783225903|5.0|Excellent film. It explores the inefficiencies of bureaucracy and paints a bleak picture of a police state, which seems ever more realistic.

0440236738|4.0|Another good book by Harlan Coben.  I only gave it four stars because I thought Tell No One was a tad superior.  Also a few times I found myself back paddling through the book for answers, that weren't there, but then showed up within the next chapter or two.  For example, why didn't Will immediately question how Sheila who supposedly was a teen-age run-a-way, into drugs and prostitution, acquire the means to go away to college?  In the book when Will found out the Sheila was away at college, I didn't understand how he (Will) wrapped his brain around that one without question. I assumed that I had to have missed something, maybe in the conversation he had with Mrs. Rogers, but no.  After deciding to keep reading forward, then it became clear.  However, if I questioned this, why didn't Will?<br /><br />Other than that, I thought it was a terrific story through and through, a great ending, too.  I've already purchased the first of the Myron Bolitar series, and look forward to all of it.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|Why do certain directors think that spending your entire budget on special effects will make an instant hit movie? Or giving in to your star so she gets a bigger role, and still gives an uninspired performance? Rumour has it, Halle Berry was refusing to come back and play Storm, because she didn't have a lot of screen time in the first two movies. So we get more of her, and a lot less of Mystique, who could have had a big storyline, but that was dropped.<br /><br />Also Cyclops (James Marsden) made the mistake of signing on to be in Superman Returns as well, and his role is greatly reduced, to a couple of scenes, and a gravestone. He gets killed by the love of his life (boy, that must have sucked), and guess what? His death happens off screen.<br /><br />And what was the sense in bringing back Famke Jansen? She doesn't do much apart from stand around and look menacing, but I suppose being brought back from the dead will do that to anyone. How exactly did she manage to come back? The character is really underdeveloped. She stands around in the background for most of the movie, until she decides to \\"annihilate\\" something or someone, just for the special effect.<br /><br />The special effects were alright, trying to make up for what was a serious lack of plot. The special effects used in the beginning of the film, where we see what happens 20 years earlier (which bore no relation to the rest of the film at all), was wasted. They attempted to make Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen 20 years younger. They amazingly failed on Patrick - he looked no different whatsoever. And Ian was given brown hair. And their faces were obviously edited and smoothed out compared to the other actors in the scene. How much money is thrown at these kinda ageing things per second?<br /><br />Then there was the obvious referencing other movies. (Or stealing scenes if you prefer.) When the film properly starts, it's nearly a direct steal from the Terminator films. The scene between IceMan and FireGuy towards the end? Did anyone else notice it was the same as the two wands clashing between Harry & Voldemort? Then at the end, it looked very similar to the final scene in Carrie, with Famke as Carrie. The bullet stopping scenes is referencing Matrix Reloaded? Or one of those films.<br /><br />And the point in Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is? The guy cannot act. When will people start realising this! The 'fat' suit he was wearing was meant to make him look like a big muscle man, but he ended up looking like a sumo wrestler gone wrong.<br /><br />Anna Paquin's role as Rogue is greatly reduced, to practically being non-existent. Wasn't she the main part of the first film? Was it worth her time turning up for filming? Did she use her mutant powers once during the film?

B00005JPG1|4.0|There are two medium range shots in Zodiac of the late and thoroughly unlamented Embarcadero freeway along the waterfront in San Francisco.  That's just one example of how lovingly and accurately -- great period soundtrack too -- the movie recreates the San Francisco of the late 60's and 70's.  The violence of the murders is neither sensationalized or ignored, but necessary to portraying the killer.  Nonetheless, the knife murders in particular are graphic.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr are all excellent, particularly Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo in their scenes together as the trail goes cold for the cop but Gyllenhaal delves ever deeper and dangerously into the case, even at the cost to his personal life.  The movie runs over two hours, but feels a half hour shorter.  (Warning -- spoiler coming in the next sentence.)  But I left the theater feeling that the time spent by Gyllenhaal in pursuing what turns out to be a false suspect was a bit arbitrary as a plot device to drag out the who-dunnit aspect of the case.  Still, for suspense, for accuracy and, most of all, for excellent ensemble work, Zodiac ranks with Breach as one of the fine movies of early 2007.
0307237699|4.0|this is a very well written book by a very well-spoken man.  since this man could be the democratic presidential candidate, i felt it was a good idea to understand him and know his views.  rather than listen to the media tell me those things, or have my friends tell me those things, it seemed a much better idea to have barack obama tell me those things.  if you intend to vote (and you really should), you should educate yourself on both the issues and the front-runner candidates.  what better way than to listen to them, and not to an opinionated media, or the public at large?  now, on to the most recent writtings from hillary, mccain, and giuliani.... <br />space puppy - out
0380789035|2.0|AMERICAN GODS is my first novel by Neil Gaiman, a very well respected fantasy writer.  This novel won a slew of awards: the Hugo, Nebula, Stoker and Locus awards for best novel of the year.  Unfortunately, I didn't really care for it.<br /><br />The concept of AMERICAN GODS is great: what if ancient gods, despite being forgotten, still walked the earth?  And what if they decided to engage in a war with the more modern \\"gods\\" of media and television?  Gaiman deserves credit for coming up with a great, original storyline that doesn't follow a standard formula.<br /><br />Still, I had significant problems with how Gaiman executed this concept.  First, the main character of Shadow was flat and lifeless.  No matter what happens to him, he reacts with stoic impassivity.  Many of the God characters are just silly and outrageous in their behavior -- nearly all of them lack emotional complexity and depth.  There are also too many characters to keep track of.  As a result, I never felt emotionally engaged by this story, and quickly began to get bored by it.<br /><br />Gaiman also doesn't plot very tightly.  There are a ton of sidebar stories in this work that have little relevance to the main storyline.  There are also a number of scenes where Shadow doesn't do much of anything but eat, lay in bed, describe the weather, and engage in pointless small talk.  All of this bogs down the momentum of the story, making for a slow-paced read that lacks any meaningful direction.<br /><br />I was also disappointed by the ending, which seemed rather sudden and anti-climactic, especially given the long and elaborate build-up.<br /><br />Again, there are some people who adore AMERICAN GODS, and it's hard to deny that Gaiman is a fine literary craftsman.  It is also clear he did a great deal of research into American history and ancient mythologies.  But none of this is a substitute for a good story, and I felt like I didn't get one with this particular effort.<br /><br />I very much wanted to like this novel, and I want to understand why people like Gaiman so much.  So I will try another Gaiman book, NEVERWHERE, before giving up on him.I very much wanted to like this novel, and I want to understand why people like Gaiman so much.

0143038419|5.0|I was handed Eat, Pray, Love by a friend of mine (who happens to be Elizabeth Gilbert's therapist mentioned in the book).  She thought it had similarities with the the novel I'm currently working on.  Initially I had no intention of reading the entire book; in fact, I started reading the last section on Indonesia first (having just been in Bali myself).  I enjoyed it so much that I went back to the beginning and read the whole book through.  What I appreciated -- apart from the fluid style and self deprecating humor -- was her ability to spice the archetypal themes of love (with all its attendant crises), earthly pleasure (Eat) and religion (Pray) in a manner that is palatable to contemporary taste.  Though I am a man I could relate to her \\"one woman's search for everything.\\"  And though this memoir is somewhat self indulgent, it does mirror the modern, well educated and liberal person quite correctly.  The spiritual dimension of the book leaves the reader free.  Elizabeth finds relief from the pain of her divorce through the earthly joy of traveling and eating on the one hand, and meditation and prayer on the other -- intimating that we need a balance of both. It was this balancing of the polarities that I particularly liked.  I found myself thinking and talking about the book quite often -- and always with enthusiasm.

0743496728|4.0|Picoult does an outstanding job of showing the whole picture behind a school shooting and forcing some of the responsibility onto the bullies, while not condoning the behavior of the shooter.  In this novel, however, the \\"twist\\" at the end seemed like a stretch and was not convincing.  Some details at the end of the book were too hastily brushed over (the romance between Alex and Patrick) which made it feel like the writing of the end of the book may have been rushed.

B00005JPLU|3.0|300, the latest entry into the genre of futuristic films, is another adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels. However, in stark contrast to Sin City, 300 does not contain any truly memorable performances or dialogue. Still, 300 accomplishes what Zach Snyder set out to do, and that is create a visual masterpiece. While 300 is dull in between fight scenes, those sequences are so exciting that they leave the viewer with an urge to throw a spear at someone.  <br /> <br />Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as King Leonidas, the man who leads 300 Spartans into battle against 250,000 Persians led by Xerxes, a king who fancies himself a god. However, Butler is the victim of poor writing, and most of his lines are cliched battle cries which at times are more amusing than inspiring. But no one is going to see 300 for the screenplay or plot. Snyder takes full advantage of this and, unlike other films that unintentionally focus on violence, Snyder deliberately bases the film on it, putting every kill in slow motion and having gallons of computer generated blood fill the screen. <br /> <br />Overall, though 300 is simple, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and is the most beautiful film (to look at, that is) I've ever seen. 300 is unabashedly violent, and takes advantage of the viewers' excitement during the battle sequences by making half of the film slow motion fight scenes. 300 is witty and exciting, one of the most enjoyable films of the 21st century, and makes 2 hours go by like 2 minutes.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|The film broaches important philosophical questions:<br /><br />First: xenophobia and government discrimination against illegal immigrants. The film-makers make a moralistic argument that criminalization of, and the stigma attached to, illegal immigration are in essence latter-day forms of officially-sanctioned racism and discrimination. Exceptionally powerful argument in the context of anti-immigrant hysteria in much of Europe and the United States.<br /><br />Second: do ends justify the means? The ancient dilemma is recast in the film as a terrorist organization with ostensibly noble aims (protection of immigrants' rights) resorts to violence and terrorism, so that the lines between good and evil are blurred in the end.<br /><br />It is certainly a film with a disturbing and yet compelling message.<br /><br />The ending, I thought, is a bit anti-climatic. The film does not have a conclusion, it just stops abruptly. The point of such an end must have been to leave it up to the viewer to imagine what happens next. It would be more interesting, though, to come up with a 1984-type ending, that drives home the film's central message in an unexpected way. Oh well, quite worth the time to watch in any case.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed is a twisting and convoluted crime drama that uses grit and excitement to thoroughly engross the viewer. While supported by a fantastic ensemble cast, the film also benefits from an intriguing plot and excellent screenplay. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays undercover cop Billy Costigan, a member of a crime family who tries to redeem himself by infiltrating the Irish Mafia in Boston, led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a mole in the Massachusetts State Police feeding information to Costello. This set up leads to a thrilling ride supported by fantastic performances from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen.  <br /> <br />Martin Scorsese returns to the form that led to Goodfellas, one of the best movies of the late 20th century, and this film rightfully earned Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. Overall, excellent performances and fantastic screenplay elevate The Departed above any other cinematic effort in 2006, and is a great way to spend two and a half hours.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I used to watch Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, first class secret agent for MI6, I couldn't help but laugh. The plots were so ridiculous, and the gadgets so amusing that the viewer couldn't help but think how unlikely anything like this could ever happen. Daniel Craig has reinvented the series as a rugged and ruthless Bond who fights most of his battles the old fashioned way and without any gadgets. In fact, the main conflict in Casino Royale is a poker game in which Bond must take down terrorist funder Le Chiffre, aided by Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).  <br /> <br />Daniel Craig plays a reflective and somber Bond, a man who trusts no one. Not to say that Craig's Bond doesn't have a taste for excitement. The action sequences and witty remarks are still there, but simply aren't as bombastic as the old days. Casino Royale keeps the plot moving, but also ensures that the film is interesting between action sequences and fight scenes. Daniel Craig carries the film as a suave and simple Bond, possibly the best Bond ever.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Director Alfonso Cuaron has two remarkable films on the \\"Children of Men\\" DVD -- the dystopian feature and a startling half-hour documentary that explores the macro-global issues raised by the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Possibility of Hope\\" doesn't have much hope in it. Cuaron rounds up a half dozen philosophers and futurists who see overpopulation, economic repression and global warming sending the planet into a new dark age. These guys make Al Gore look like a gushing optimist. Future editions of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" should have this as a kicker in case anyone is cheered up by the Melissa Etheridge closing number.<br /><br />\\"It's not a matter of people surviving,\\" says scientist and philosopher James Lovelock. \\"It's a matter of civilization surviving. ... It can easily degenerate into a dark age again. It's quite possible that will happen.\\"<br /><br />The apocalyptic future always eluded filmmakers, but many tried, including the mighty Kubrick (\\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). None of the films felt truly possible, probably because the filmmakers overworked their visions. \\"Children of Men\\" succeeded by Curan's insistence that all scenes from his 2027 \\"show me the reference in real life.\\" The movie -- about a world in which no babies are born -- easily holds up against all Oscar contenders for best picture. Clive Owens, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine star.<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" looks fine on Universal's single-disc release, the grit, grain and grays of the film all intact.

B000ION79Y|1.0|What can I say? <br />I would've been disappointed if I'd only rented this DVD, let alone bought it. Like the other reviewers, i too have been a seagal fan since Above the Law. His movies have been going down hill recently - but there have at least been some saving qualities amongst them! Attack force is pure unadulterated insidious crap. If you haven't stuck cutlery (or any convenient household utensil) into your ears by the half way point, there's something wrong with you. The voice dubbing is pathetic. A female voice with an indian accent would sound closer to Mr Seagal's own voice than the gravelly whisp that emanated from his mouth for most of the dialogue.  <br />Maybe that's the movie's saving grace: you can't turn away - if you do, you won't know who's talking!

B000LC3ID8|1.0|Not sure why this has got such a high rating as it is a complete waste of time. While 'Saw' had a unique story, this remains in the brain for all of 5 minutes after it is turned off and revels in sadism and ridiculous logic for what seems like an ice age. Firstly Jigsaw should not have been revealed and an attempt to make him more 'human' with a flashback to his former life is just ridiculous. Plus why does he torture people as punishment for leading amoral lives? isn't his just as amoral? <br />The other characters in the film are witless, particularly the man assigned to 'play a game' which is based on showing mercy (or not) to the various people involved in the car crash which killed his daughter, this moron takes far far too long to make what should be split second decisions - watch the scene with the guy in the twister device and you'll see what I mean. We also get the background of Jigsaws accomplice, add to that a convoluted plot 'twist' and you have 90 or so minutes from your life you will never get back. Now *thats* torture.
1593072937|4.0|Frank Miller's brutal tale tells the story of a doomed vendetta in the dark underworld of Sin City. The visual language is incredibly powerful, fully exploiting and augmenting every trick in the handbook of the black & white masters. The art is without doubt 5 stars. The story is weaker though. It feels a bit too long and a bit too repetitive to make this graphic novel a timeless masterpiece. It is very worth the read though, as long as you can stomach endless violence and crude characters.
B0009UC810|5.0|This is the best film ever made based on a sketch from SNL (Wayne's World isn't too bad, either, but nowhere as classic as this film).  It encompasses quite a lot into its screenplay, and despite being nearly 2 1/2 hours (at least in its original roadshow version), there is never a dull moment and it never feels like the filmmakers were killing time.  Most SNL sketch films barely run 90 minutes, and they feel like 9 1/2 hours because they're so incredibly bad.  The recent SNL sketch films have maybe one or two laughs in them, padded by 80 minutes of godawful material.  This film, on the other hand, has classic scene after classic scene, classic line after classic line, and it's nice to see Chicago back in the late 1970's.  The Maxwell Street that you see here no longer exists (thanks, Mayor Dumba** Daley).  The neighborhood has been gentrified, and the historic Maxwell street has bitten the dust.  It's also wonderful to see most of Chicago destroyed in this film.  I am from Chicago and don't particulary care for the city as a whole, so this film is especially sweet.  The actual mall that is destroyed in this film (one of my favorite scenes) isn't in Chicago, but was shot in nearby Harvey, Illinois, a south suburb of Chicago.  This film is an example of great movie comedy, and it has never dated.  It has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time, which doesn't hurt one bit.  John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd actually played old time blues and soul songs on their albums, and had a deep respect for these art forms.  They weren't being \\"ironic\\" or anything like that.  The musicians in their backup band played on a lot of old blues and soul records.  Their acting ability is somewhat limited, but their brilliant musicianship surpasses it.  The musical numbers here have a joy and exuberance that is sorely lacking in Hollywood today.  There are so many reasons to like this film, which makes it even more endearing.  A true classic comedy....

B000NA28IE|1.0|I must admit, I really disliked the book. <br /> <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />But this movie is ten times worse. <br /> <br />Really, it is.  Whether you liked the book or hated it, is completely irrelevant.  No matter WHAT you thought of the book, this movie sucked.  I was hoping for a movie that was good, not a bad one.  But this is what I saw: No acting skills, a director that probably dropped out of high school, and crappy \\"special effects.\\"  Seriously--Ed Speleers sucked too.  He doesn't know how to act.  Maybe he should find another job. <br /> <br />The whole movie was bad, to be honest.  The ONLY good part about it was the weird dragon that Dhurza was riding at the end--it looked cool, that's about it.  Other than tha, the movie was horrible.  Also, disc 2 of the special edition was not worth watching.  It contains about a half hour of a documentary showing how the special effects were done.  Well what \\"special effects\\" are there to show?  It was all done by computer animation!  To the creators of the movie: Nobody cares about watching you go through the 3D animation process step-by-step you fools.  Seriously, what a bunch of idiots. <br /> <br />By the way, there can't be a movie of Eldest.  Know why?  Because: Brom killed both Ra'Zaac in the movie.  But they are in the 2nd book...how are you gonna make a 2nd movie without them in it?  Oh yeah, of course--you can just make it suck like the 1st movie did.  I forgot.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a movie with good battle scenes in it, then watch The Lord of the Rings.  Not this pile of trash.  Even the special edition is garbage, to be honest.  These movie directors need some mental help before they start directing movies.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|As much as I want to like this album - I love the whole of Wilco's catalog prior to this, even the spirited country jangle of A.M. - this outing feels like a dry hump, devoid of either interesting musical detours or compelling lyrics we've come to expect from Jeff Tweedy and whatever lineup he happens to be paired with at the time. Sobriety and domesticity have dampened Tweedy's lyrical gifts, and the music runs a safe path through tried and true 70s AOR formulas and \\"easy-listening\\" / Yacht Rock comfort zones. <br /> <br />There are hummable melodies a-plenty but none of the risk-taking or edge we associate with Jeff Tweedy since he has staked his claim as one of the more relevant recording artists of the new century. <br /> <br />Nels Cline's ultra tasteful thousand-note bursts of guitar do little to shake things up, and one longs for either the brilliant yet underrated Young / Verlaine / Moore-inspired guitar work Tweedy himself conjured up on A Ghost is Born or the beautifully dense keyboards and guitars Jay Bennett contributed to the nearly flawless run of Being There > Summerteeth > Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Here we have more musicians than Wilco ever had, yet the sum is far less than the total of its parts. Monumentally disappointing.

B00005JPMX|5.0|The Turtles have been around in one incarnation or another for more than a generation now.  They started out as a black-and-white comic by Eastman and Laird, who have gone on to other things but have never grown beyond this one HUGE splash they made in comics and kids cartoons.<br /><br />The original Turtles weren't for kids.  The action in the comics was gritty and bloody.  They originally didn't sell well.  In their first incarnation, they were like a parody of the white-hot X-Men at the time.<br /><br />Then someone out in television production land looked at the idea and thought the Turtles would be an excellent addition to the kids market that the X-Men cartoons had opened up.  And we soon had Turtles everywhere.  Cartoons, comics, movies, and action figures soon blossomed everywhere.<br /><br />Now we have TMNT, which is most likely the relaunch of the movie franchise.  Thankfully we're not treated to a rehash of Turtle history and the origin story.  Unless you've been living in some far-off shell, you know the story of the four turtles and the rat that were exposed to radioactive slime and became Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Master Splinter.  April O'Neil and Casey Jones are also up to bat in this one (sorry, I couldn't resist).<br /><br />The plot centers around a billionaire CEO named Max Winters who's been alive for 3000 years thanks to a spell that introduced 13 monsters into the world.  The planets only line up in a certain way every 3000 years to provide the energy to open a doorway to another world (you'd think they'd find a better power source!).  Winters also had four generals who served him that were turned to stone.  They've recently returned to life and are now looking for the 13 monsters to power up the sorcerous spell again.  Mix in the Foot Clan who are working for Winters and you've got a return to greatness.<br /><br />The characterizations for the Turtles, Splinter, April O'Neil (voiced by Sarah Michelle Geller), and Casey Jones are spot-on.  April comes across a little to Tomb Raiderish for me, but it works overall.<br /><br />However, Leonardo has been gone from the group for the last year and doesn't really want to return.  When he does, it's just in time and there's a world to save and a family to reclaim.<br /><br />TMNT is beautifully rendered in computer generated artwork.  Although it does admittedly look like a cartoon and you're never really pulled into the this-is-real mindset even the three live-action movies of the 1980s achieved to a somewhat limited dgeree, the world is big and vibrant.  The musical score compliments the action and the moods really well.  The fight between Raphael and one of the demons to the rollicking licks of \\"Black Betty\\" have to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />My nine-year-old was in heaven.  There were plenty of funny bits, actions as well as one-liners, that kept him in stitches.  Even though some of the movie is predicatable for the adult mind, I still had a blast and found myself chuckling along with my kid.  Even my 17-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter, who I thought would never want to see this movie, had a great time when they decided to join us.<br /><br />The martial arts moves, the mad dashes across the rooftops, and the larger-than-life creatures in combat on the screen looked terrific.  You're not going to get this kind of experience in live-action, and the cartoons simply don't have this kind of budget for CGI.<br /><br />The movie treks along familiar themes and doesn't really go anywhere new, but it is a fantastic treatment of material that has become part of a generation's heritage.

B000K7VHJQ|4.0|Reflections on The Passion of Christ:   Inundated by the sound and the fury of endless media discussions about Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, I thought it might be better to actually see it before proffering an opinion.     As I experienced The Passion, it become clear that in a couple of areas many of the negative pundits were, as Shakespeare would say, \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"     Anti-Semitism: The most loudly trumpeted objection to the movie by the many pundits was that it would inspire anti-Semitism. While the religious leaders in The Passion were fervent in their desire to have Jesus crucified, the average American - not burdened with medieval European hatreds, would see no more than a bunch of pompous big-wigs trying to kill off the competition.     They represent Everyman, not just jealous Jewish leaders, as the Iranian clerics showed by excluding Muslim moderates from running in their elections. In addition, leaders hiring hit men to do their dirty work is, after all, a great tradition among criminals, businessmen, and politicians.     Jealousy is jealousy, no matter where it pops up. Most Americans would see the Sanhedrin as jealous leaders, not jealous Jews.     Violence: Movie critics who praise and give awards to the most horribly violent and disgusting films are now complaining about the violence in The Passion. It is ironic to hear complaints about violence from critics who have absolutely no compunction about foisting even the most perverted garbage upon our children as Great Art.     Although Mel added a gratuitously gruesome eye-pecking crow for effect, at least he didn't try to change the essential nature of a main character in the reasonable historical accounts that we have.     Mis-characterized bad guys: The idea that \\"we know that Pilate was too bad to have had second thoughts about killing Jesus\\" is simply silly. A man intelligent enough to be governor of the toughest Roman province was certainly capable of wonderingwhether a charismatic teacher who was constantly followed by thousands should be executed by obviously jealous leaders whom Pilate didn't like much anyway. May we be protected from theological novelists.     Slightly Negative: As one who comes from a religious tradition that mixes enthusiastic worship with quiet meditation, I fully expected to be moved to tears and renewed devotion by the movie, as I am often moved by movies that have much less of a claim on profundity than the Passion. But I did not seem to experience the strong emotions that some have professed after seeing the film.     Why? First of all, while a realistic vivid portrayal of the beatings and torture of Christ could give moviegoers an accurate picture of the physical sufferings that he endured, there comes a point at which such details numb rather than enlighten the observer. Mel Gibson's tendency in his other movies to stretch out scenes longer than they need to be is evident in The Passion.     The horrible beatings inflicted by Pilate's Roman soldiers are almost overwhelming by themselves, though they seem to be more inspired by flagellation fanatics than historical accuracy.     Flogging and crucifixion were a science for the Romans, as they tended to give \\"forty stripes save one,\\" as many more lashes would kill even a strong person. A Roman soldier who was charged with simply beating a prisoner would be severely punished if his prisoner died. The blood and gore of the beating scene was clearly overdone, as no one who had lost that much blood could have survived to make it to a crucifixion, which was designed to be a long, painful process to death.     Interestingly enough, a more representative picture of the damage done by Roman flogging could be seen on the man of the Shroud of Turin [...]- administered by a Jewish photographer], whether or not one believes that the shroud is the genuine burial cloth of Jesus.     While wounds from flogging would be terrible, they wouldn't be as overwhelmingly grisly as the bloody dissections in Mel Gibson's reconstruction. And then Mr. Gibson adds even more beating scenes in an excessively violent journey from Pilate's Place to the place of crucifixion.     It is unlikely that highly-disciplined Roman soldiers would have behaved in such an undisciplined way, creating and accepting near-riot conditions during the long walk to Golgotha by someone who had already been beaten to a pulp.     It is also unlikely that even a healthy man could carry the huge 400-pound cross up and down such steep hills. I expect that potential victims would only carry the crosspiece, not the whole cross.    As followers of Jesus generally believe that the burden of collective responsibility for all of the sins of the world was far worse than physical suffering, which many have endured, it would seem a bit unbalanced to over-emphasize one at the expense of the other. But maybe that's a question for theologians to endlessly argue about - not movie-goers.     However, for all its weaknesses, The Passion is probably the most realistic portrayal of a powerful and charismatic Jesus and the humanity of his mother Mary ever seen in a movie.     Along with the final scene, which is, after all, the main thing that distinguishes Jesus' death from many other victims of torture, Mel Gibson's movie graphically illustrates why the followers of Jesus profess to love a leader who can, in the face of the most hideous torture, ask his Father to \\"forgive them, for they know not what they do.\\"

Some may call this suicidal; the reader is supposed to see it as heroic. This scene is exemplary of what you're getting into if you pick this book up.     This isn't Clary's first stupid action: she makes a habit of putting herself in harm's way by doing things she has little or no reason to, especially when there's others around telling her to stop. Other characters also do unreasonable things, if only to further the plot. A character is caught hiding in someone's bushes because he decided THEY were suspicious while he was sneaking around their house, but never gives a reason for his initial trespassing.  He later drinks a magical potion with unknown effects for no good reason whatsoever, despite having someone who'd know better at his side telling him not to.    The book has no sense of continuity. Characters' eye colors, voices, abilities, and builds change, sometimes within paragraphs of their initial descriptions. (Clary's mother goes from \\"compact\\" to \\"tall and willowy\\" in paragraphs on page 24; Madame Dorothea's voice goes from familiarly \\"shrill\\" to familiarly \\"gravelly\\" on page 95; Alec's eyes go from blue to black and back again throughout the course of the book; Isabelle's skin is as \\"unblemished as the surface of a bowl of cream\\" on page 58, but all Shadowhunters are later described as covered in scars from their Marks.) A character puts himself and his love interest in mortal danger without hesitation, but later blames his poor performance in a fight on his worry for her. A fire hot enough to melt metal and turn bricks to ash (bricks melt at about three thousand degrees and don't contain enough organic material to burn to ash) doesn't reduce any bones - even an infant's bones - to ash, and manages to leave cloth fragments behind as well. Clary can do magic with runes that she literally should not be able to know, and Simon is able to see a magical glow to things and the invisible Shadowhunters even though he's supposed to be a magicless human.     A good editor would pick these problems out - but unfortunately, upon comparison with the \\"uncorrected proofs\\" of the Advance Reader Copy, it seems that the most basic problems haven't even been touched. For example, screaming characters still switch indiscriminately between italics and ALL CAPS, and the missing quotation mark from page 449 of the ARC is still missing on page 452 of the hardcover. Other words and descriptions still stand out as extremely out of place. Horses \\"snarl.\\" Arrows make \\"hot buzzing sounds, like a huge bumblebee.\\" Octopuses have \\"tendrils\\" instead of tentacles, and antifreeze and spring grass are somehow the same color. Another world's sun is described as hanging \\"limp in the sky like a burned cinder\\" - I don't even know where to start with that one. Water is described as being \\"the color of lead, churned to a whipped cream consistency.\\" What feels like whipped cream again - the water, or the lead? And how would that even work?    Also, very few things in the work hail as original. Clary Fray (not Whedon's Slayer Melaka Fray) goes to Pandemonium (not The Bronze from Buffyverse), sees something she shouldn't, and is taken in by the Shadowhunters (not Dark-hunters), who call normal humans \\"mundanes\\" or \\"mundies\\" (from the set-in-NYC-comic Fables) and who power up and do magic by carving or drawing runes on themselves or other objects, just like in Weis and Hickman's Death Gate Cycle. They do this with a particular wand/knife hybrid called a \\"stele\\" - which, unlike the Stiehl of Terry Brooks's Shannara series, is a real word...for a headstone. The secret group of Shadowhunters is trying to rescue a magical relic before the big bad guy Valentine (whose past is Voldemort's, only without any character depth whatsoever) gets it, a plot that's been done completely to death. Finally, the \\"twist\\" of this book comes straight out of Star Wars and is guessable from chapter two.     The characters are also terribly flat, cliché, and inconsistent. Clary is \\"shy\\" but slaps people she barely knows; she's \\"clumsy\\" but the reader never sees her act that way. Jace is the stereotypical snugglebug in a jerk suit, straight out of a bad romance novel and so blindingly beautiful that absolutely everyone must comment on it. It frequently seems that cast of characters doesn't have personalities; only unbelievable dialogue, redundant and clunky metaphors, and little tics that are supposed to identify them.     Granted, there are some hilarious parts. Clary's makeover sends her out on the streets of New York City in a shirt (worn as a dress) that barely covers her rear, with high-heeled boots, fishnet stockings, lots of makeup, and no bra. Then she fights vampires while dressed like this. Later on, no one can figure out why her mother's won't come out of a coma.     (I'm not sure if those two events are related, but I'd like to think they are.)     The sheer number of errors, derivative ideas, and pages of copy & pasted fanfic bits is hideously sloppy and exemplary of lazy writing and lazier editing. It's as if no one cared to check things over before putting the book on the shelves. It's insulting to the reader to not try to fix any of these problems, and then to expect the consumer to shell out their money for something that isn't new, isn't different, isn't even coherent, and frankly just isn't very good. Don't waste your money on it.
B00028HBKC|4.0|Reflections on The Passion of Christ:   Inundated by the sound and the fury of endless media discussions about Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, and wanting to stay abreast of important current events, I decided to brave the long lines and get an early took at such a significant phenomenon. I thought it might be better to actually see it before proffering an opinion.     As I experienced The Passion, it become clear that in a couple of areas many of the negative pundits were, as Shakespeare would say, \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"     Anti-Semitism: The most loudly trumpeted objection to the movie by the many pundits was that it would inspire anti-Semitism. While the religious leaders in The Passion were fervent in their desire to have Jesus crucified, the average American - not burdened with medieval European hatreds, would see no more than a bunch of pompous big-wigs trying to kill off the competition.     They represent Everyman, not just jealous Jewish leaders, as the Iranian clerics showed by excluding Muslim moderates from running in their elections. In addition, leaders hiring hit men to do their dirty work is, after all, a great tradition among criminals, businessmen, and politicians.     Jealousy is jealousy, no matter where it pops up. Most Americans would see the Sanhedrin as jealous leaders, not jealous Jews.     Violence: Movie critics who praise and give awards to the most horribly violent and disgusting films are now complaining about the violence in The Passion. It is ironic to hear complaints about violence from critics who have absolutely no compunction about foisting even the most perverted garbage upon our children as Great Art.     Mis-characterized bad guys: The idea that \\"we know that Pilate was too bad to have had second thoughts about killing Jesus\\" is simply silly. A man intelligent enough to be governor of the toughest Roman province was certainly capable of wondering whether a charismatic teacher who was constantly followed by thousands should be executed by obviously jealous leaders whom Pilate didn't like much anyway. May we be protected from theological novelists.     Although Mel added a gratuitously gruesome eye-pecking crow for effect, at least he didn't try to change the essential nature of a main character in the reasonable historical accounts that we have.     Slightly Negative: As one who comes from a religious tradition that mixes enthusiastic worship with quiet meditation, I fully expected to be moved to tears and renewed devotion by the movie, as I am often moved by movies that have much less of a claim on profundity than the Passion. But I did not seem to experience the strong emotions that some have professed after seeing the film.     Why? First of all, while a realistic vivid portrayal of the beatings and torture of Christ could give moviegoers an accurate picture of the physical sufferings that he endured, there comes a point at which such details numb rather than enlighten the observer. Mel Gibson's tendency in his other movies to stretch out scenes longer than they need to be is evident in The Passion.     The horrible beatings inflicted by Pilate's Roman soldiers are almost overwhelming by themselves, though they seem to be more inspired by flagellation fanatics than historical accuracy.     Flogging and crucifixion were a science for the Romans, as they tended to give \\"forty stripes save one,\\" as many more lashes would kill even a strong person. A Roman soldier who was charged with simply beating a prisoner would be severely punished if his prisoner died. The blood and gore of the beating scene was clearly overdone, as no one who had lost that much blood could have survived to make it to a crucifixion, which was designed to be a long, painful process to death.     Interestingly enough, a more representative picture of the damage done by Roman flogging could be seen on the man of the Shroud of Turin [...], whether or not one believes that the shroud is the genuine burial cloth of Jesus.     While wounds from flogging would be terrible, they wouldn't be as overwhelmingly grisly as the bloody dissections in Mel Gibson's reconstruction. And then Mr. Gibson adds even more beating scenes in an excessively violent journey from Pilate's Place to the place of crucifixion.     It is unlikely that highly-disciplined Roman soldiers would have behaved in such an undisciplined way, creating and accepting near-riot conditions during the long walk to Golgotha by someone who had already been beaten to a pulp.     It is also unlikely that even a healthy man could carry the huge 400-pound cross up and down such steep hills. I expect that potential victims would only carry the crosspiece, not the whole cross.    As followers of Jesus generally believe that the burden of collective responsibility for all of the sins of the world was far worse than physical suffering, which many have endured, it would seem a bit unbalanced to over-emphasize one at the expense of the other. But maybe that's a question for theologians to endlessly argue about - not movie-goers.     However, for all its weaknesses, The Passion is probably the most realistic portrayal of a powerful and charismatic Jesus and the humanity of his mother Mary ever seen in a movie.     Along with the final scene, which is, after all, the main thing that distinguishes Jesus' death from many other victims of torture, Mel Gibson's movie graphically illustrates why the followers of Jesus profess to love a leader who can, in the face of the most hideous torture, ask his Father to \\"forgive them, for they know not what they do.\\"
0380973634|4.0|It might be because I watched the first two BBC episodes of Neverwhere that I found the beginning of this book boring, but regardless I struggled through the first half of the book. To me it wasn't up to Gaiman standards. But in the later half of the book, it took off, and things started becoming more interesting, there were some surprises and twists, and it built to a nice climatic ending. So even though I struggled through the beginning of this book, the second half of this book made it for me, and I ended up really liking this book. It's no American God's, but it is still a pretty good book. And I will say it is original, so that was a plus. If you like Gaiman it's worth a buy!

B00005JPGO|5.0|Well, there's already several long and detailed reviews about this film, so I'll just keep mine sort and to the point.<br /><br />Obviously this movie tells the tale of the Civil War in Sierra Leone over \\"conflict diamonds\\" in the late '90s...specifically 1999.  Conflict diamonds are basically those that are mined in Sierra Leone, but then smuggled into neighboring countries like Liberia (which was lead at the time by Charles Taylor) and then sold on the black market for much more than what the government Sierra Leone would be willing to pay and then sell them for.<br /><br />This lead to a group of rebels (the RUF - Revolutionary United Front) to spring up to oppose the government.  However these rebels were brutal in their diamond mining process.  They'd shoot anybody that didn't provide their share of slave work to mine the diamonds, basically.  This got to the point of slaughtering entire villages and then even the capital city, Freetown.  It wasn't until 2003 when a Treaty was signed by all diamond-producing African countries to keep \\"conflict diamonds\\" out of Western retailers.  However, this treaty isn't perfect and even to this day, many diamonds make it through this somewhat loose treaty and make it to stores near you.<br /><br />I may sound like a bleeding heart liberal on this issue, but this is pretty much the only issue I feel this way about.  I'm pretty much a hard conservative when it comes to everything else, but mining diamonds is pretty much legalized slavery and people die for the slighest infringement on their so-called duties.  Women really need to think twice before they request a huge rock from their fiances.  How many people have to die for you to wear a piece of ice?
0060887966|5.0|This is a lovely little parable.  It shows the path each of us may travel and why.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|First let me say that this review has been a long time coming, actually.<br /><br />Evanescence truly broke through with their second album, FALLEN, which was ubiquitous it seemed. \\"My Immortal\\" seemed to come from every radio station everywhere and help propel that album to multiplatinum status (six times certified!) THE OPEN DOOR ultimately saw a number one (not surprising) with nearly half-million sold the first week, and though it did go platinum, the album ultimately didn't turn out to be the hit it was expected to, especially after the reception of FALLEN. Sure, the \\"sophomore\\" effect plays a role, but ultimately let's face it, THE OPEN DOOR just isn't as good.  \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" didn't resonate quite the same as \\"My Immortal\\" and second single \\"Lithium\\" went nowhere. THE OPEN DOOR just doesn't \\"have it\\" like FALLEN, and the songs show it blatantly.<br /><br />The album stars on point with the rocking \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" in which Lee exibits nice upper facility with exceptional falsetto. Here, Lee sounds like \\"goth-chick\\" sings \\"opera\\", which she proves is not so far-fetched in the least. Lee's control is also great, particularly for a rock star, who often tend to be overwrought with screaming.  The songwriting is on point as well with a very catchy, head-bobbing hook.  The angular guitar riffs add to the whole vibe and solidify an exceptional opening number.  Even more exceptional is first single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\".  Constantly, Lee harped on [in interviews] how Ben Moody refused to let her do certain things (musically) on the previous Evanescence album, FALLEN.  One of those things was the inclusion of organ.  With Moody's exit, Lee includes organ at the tail-end of \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" and it proves to be one cool touch.  The piano driven introduction is also very cool leading up to the sudden entrance of driving guitars playing angular, \\"screwed-up\\" rhythms.  Again, Lee sounds terrific here, as always. Some are quick to say that \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" is corny and stupid, but I honestly think it is a very credible, worth-while performance and a nice addition to the Evanescence \\"hit\\" catalogue.<br /><br />After two solid hits (\\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\"), Evanescence breaks into another rocker, \\"Weight of the World\\".  \\"Weight\\" doesn't prove to be bad, and the guitar work in particular is fabulous, as always.  It doesn't quite live up to the greatness of the latter, but it does paint the picture of a \\"gothic\\" world and paints the details pretty accurately, even if it isn't as strong as the strongest tracks here. If nothing else, the opera at the end is certainly a cool touch.  \\"Lithium\\" continues a streak of consistent numbers on THE OPEN DOOR.  The exception is that for the first time, things have finally slow down a bit.  Again, Lee exhibits dark, but she does it in such a beautiful way-- quite a paradox.  This was the perfect choice for the second single from THE OPEN DOOR, even if it wasn't the hit it should've been. \\"Cloud Nine\\", sees a host of beautiful background harmonies at the very beginning.  The production is slick here (as it is throughout THE OPEN DOOR) and the loop (set by the background) is lovely.  \\"Cloud Nine\\" is a bit all over the place where songwriting is concerned, unlike the preceding numbers.  The major problem is that you feel that Lee & Evanescence tried to pour \\"too much\\" into it as opposed to making it simpler and less manic.  Hence, the problem is that \\"Cloud Nine\\" feels \\"affected\\", which is a partial problem with THE OPEN DOOR. Sure, the whacky guitar riffs and unpredictability are appreciated, but not to the point where the fans or the audience can't find connection with the song.<br /><br />\\"Snow White Queen\\" once again experiments with sound effects, which makes the listener listen intently to hear \\"everything\\". It definitely catches your attention, but it isn't nearly as memorable as \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Call Me When Your Sober\\", \\"Weightof The World\\", or \\"Lithium\\". and that is the problem. \\"Lacrymosa\\" returns THE OPEN DOOR to form, lifting off \\"Lacrimosa\\" from Mozart's \\"Requiem\\" and turning it into a metal masterpiece.  Sure, maybe it isn't as strong as the strongest tracks, but it is cool if it's nothing else and much more memorable than \\"Cloud Nine\\" or \\"Snow White Queen\\" could wish to be.<br /><br />\\"Like You\\" once again, uses the \\"mysterious\\" production effect at the onset and by now, the \\"sheen\\" has faded and it is a bit too predictable. This time though, Evanescence doesn't dabble into the effect, and moves on into the \\"meat\\" of the songs.  Unfortunately, \\"Like You\\" doesn't truly resonate, similar to the overwrought \\"Cloud Nine\\" or the boring, forgettable \\"Snow White Queen\\".  At this point (aside from \\"Lithium\\"), you have the feeling that maybe THE OPEN DOOR has become incredibly affected. \\"Lose Control\\" also proves to be all over the place, not unlike \\"Cloud Nine\\".  Evanescence tries to pull every ounce of every style into it, not unlike Fall Out Boy, who try to do the same thing (though more effectively) on their latest effort, INFINITY ON HIGH. \\"The Only One\\" fines Lee singing over subtle piano and then rising above the addition of guitars.  Eventually, \\"The Only One\\" develops into a full-on metal-infused number.  It isn't stellar, but it trumps the most forgettable tracks and even threatens to bring the album back to being inspired.<br /><br />\\"Your Star\\" adds once again the organ that made \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" so enthralling.  It isn't fantastic or incredibly inspired, but it is listenable, if forgettable unltimately. Cool is the guitar/organ/piano work, if the songwriting is par or below. \\"All That I'm Living For\\" serves as the penultimate song on THE OPEN DOOR. It is also the first number under four minutes for a while on THE OPEN DOOR. Ultimately, it feels generic, which is unfortunate. However, final track \\"Good Enough\\" proves to be a great way to end the unfortunately flawed THE OPEN DOOR.  It is sincere and slows the tempo down, allowing for Amy Lee to truly express herself vocally. It is the first track that compares to the best of the best-- \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", \\"Lithium\\", and \\"Lacrymosa\\". It isn't, unfortunately enough to change the tide of the entire album.<br /><br />Again, despite the high expectations, THE OPEN DOOR is flawed with material that doesn't always stand on its own.  Evanescence and its producer (Dave Fortman) should've truly taken note of the strongest material on the album (\\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Call Me When You Sober\\", \\"Weight of the World\\" [sketchy], \\"Lithium\\", \\"Lacrymosa\\", and \\"Good Enough\\") and patterned the remainder of songs after those great numbers.

B0000AUHPK|4.0|This film is excellent, not too long and not too short, with the light and mood that would make Emily Bronte proud. Love the casting of Sinead O'Connor as EB herself at the beginning and end! The soundtrack is about the only element that gets to be a bit much - that same series of notes over and over doesn't really do justice to the visuals. Even though Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are visibly considerably older than the teenaged- to early-twenties Heathcliffe and Catherine of the story, they are very believable. Other presentations of Wuthering Heights have a polished, \\"sexy\\" Heathcliffe who just isn't right since Heathcliffe is a monster through and through. Fiennes carries it off beautifully with a barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene, yet remains sympathetic somehow. Binoche's mischievous smirk is perfect for the Cathy who is more succubus than, for instance, Merle Oberon's glamorous princess in the 1939 version. I don't often buy movies to own and repeatedly view, so my shelf of favorites is not large, but this movie is prominent among them.
B00006ADFL|4.0|Lest there be any doubt, Peter Jackson's skillful adaptation of this true story prepared the way for his masterpiece, \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Abandoning chronological order to focus on audience-pleasing drama, he takes the time to establish the fateful bond between the two leads and from it spins their trail of liberation and destruction. A must-see for any storyteller faced with adapting a true story.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I had no idea who Corinne Bailey Rae was until I stumbled upon one of those \\"free\\" concerts on Pay Per View. I could not change the channel. Not only is she just pretty to look at she has a voice that is just as sweet. Her songs have depth but her voice and simple arrangements keep everything breezy. Somewhat deceptive as she sings of heartache and longing. She is really a Jill Scott meets Alicia Keys. I enjoy listening to the CD when its more alternative, jazz lite and not so pop as in the track Breathless. Its another debut where the artist's talent is evident but their distinct voice has yet to be found.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Yep, this is one film that earned its rave reviews. Its a very deep, involving movie, full of twists and turns. The film is not perfect, it is a little slow in the middle, but the good far outwieghs the bad.  <br /> <br />The one thing that stands out is David Bowie's solid performance as Nikola Tesla, who was \\"spooky\\" smart in real life. I rarely see a film that is this well put together with such a great cast. Hugh Jackman's performance was great, starting off as the protagonist of the movie who let obsession turn him into a monster.  Christian Bale puts in another great performance as the rival illusionist.  <br /> <br />Also, After I watched this movie, I was curious about the scene with the cat. I think it was a clever reference to \\"Schrodinger's cat\\" - Erwin Schrödinger's famous 1935 illustration of the principle in quantum theory of superposition. Any film that can fit that reference into its story deserves a look.

After viewing the disc played back on my Panasonic BD Player and viewing on a 50\\" Pioneer plasma along with the 5.1 LPCM soundtrack I can say that this movie blew me away.  Not only is this the best Bond movie to date but the transfer on Blu-Ray disc is top notch.  The picture is STUNNING to say the least with every possible detail replayed in crystal clear HD and the sound is unbelievable... If you are a fan of this movie and you have a Blu-Ray set-up then I recommend you order this title today if you don't already have it in your collection.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I didn't see this in the theater and I couldnt wait for it to hit DVD so I could watch it at home. Once again, Sony has changed something and rendered the movie useless. If you have a high end DVD player, you may not be able to play Disc one. We have a Denon and a Mitsubishi and the disc will not play on them. Plays great on our $80 portable with 7\\" screen though! :P
B000M341QO|5.0|I say this movie is way more then 5 stars.~~~This movie kept me on the edge of the couch.  I didn't even want to go to the bathroom nor get a drink.  Matter of fact, I had others go to the kitchen as I held the remote on pause.  Other times we just had to play back sense to make sure nothing got by.  This movie is to watch without blinking.  Action for today's time.  Things that are happening today close up.  I love this movie and tell everyone I know and don't know to watch it.  You will not loose any interest from the first second to the last.  The ending has you on edge too.  I didn't want it to end!!! The movie is almost 3 hours long, but you won't even notice the time once your in.  So Hold On, this one is one of those true rides ya gonna like.
1582701709|5.0|For those who read this book with an open Mind and Heart, you will benefit the most. This book is all about attitude, if you have a bad attitude about life and living then this book isn't for you, but if your living your best life and want it to be better, then there is much to be taken from the SECRET. It isn't all about the \\"Stuff\\" you can have, but the VERY BEST LIFE YOU CAN HAVE.......that makes it all worth reading.
B000MCH5TU|1.0|I watched this movie with much anticipation.  However, it is impossible to evaluate a movie in which two-thirds of the dialog is not in english when the Captioning system does not work.  I also use the XBox HD-DVD player, so I can't say if the DVD or the player has problems, but the movie was rendered incomprehensible by the flawed captioning.  You could only see half of the dialog.  Don't buy this movie - rent it and make sure it plays properly.
B000GY729M|4.0|The title-track opener alone is enough to justify this shameless throwback to the days in your adolescence when everything was so important that you just had to yell something, anything.  There may not have been a finer over-the-top rock anthem since \\"In a Big Country,\\" or, okay, if you insist, \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />Sure, it's derivative -- but if you move in that certain orbit, there's not much chance of escaping the Killers' gravity.
0743496728|5.0|By far, one of the best books I've read in quite some time!
0143038419|5.0|I found this book so beautifully and soulfully written.  There is so much wisdom here and I was glad to find someone in my own age bracket also trying to find her place in this world.  So many women choose to be single and haven't claimed responsibility for their own contentment.  We have much to learn and I applaud Liz for her efforts in showing us a path.
B00005JPMC|5.0|\\"Shooter\\" is great! The cast led by Mark Wahlberg, is great! The directing by Antoine Fuqua (who also directed \\"Training Day\\" (2001) is great! The screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin (who also did the screenplay to \\"Red Planet\\" (2000), which is based on the novel \\"Point Of Impact\\" by Stephen Hunter, is great. The music by Mark Mancina (who also did the music to \\"Training Day\\") is great. The cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr. (who also did the cinematography to \\"Four Brothers\\" (2005), also starring Wahlberg) is great. The film editing by Conrad Buff IV (who also did the film editing to Fuqua's \\"Training Day\\", \\"Tears Of The Sun\\" (2003) & \\"King Arthur\\" (2004) and won the Oscar for his work on \\"Titanic\\" (1997) & Eric A. Sears (who also did the film editing to \\"Cellular\\" (2004) is great. The casting by Mali Finn (who also did the casting to \\"The Number 23\\" (2007) & Jackie Lind is great. The production design by J. Dennis Washington (who also did the production design to \\"Premonition\\" (2007) & Vance Lorenzini is great. The art direction by Jeremy Stanbridge (who also did the art direction to \\"Eight Below\\" (2006) is great. The set decoration by Johanne Hubert (who also did the set decoration to \\"Firewall\\" (2006) is great. The costume design by Ha Nguyen (who also did the costume design to \\"Swordfish\\" (2001) is great. This is a great action movie that keeps your heart rate going.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I loved this animated cartoon, but hadn't seen it in such a long time I had forgotten just how strange it was until my 3 year old granddaughter asked, \\"Why are the flowers yelling at Alice?\\"  It is definitely a cartoon for older children and adults, knowing its whimsical nature.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|As a long time blues collector, this is one of the best cds and DVDs I have ever purchased. I rank it with Clapton's Crossroads, Lightning in a Bottle, and Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn/Session. For the money, you can't purchase a better blues compilation.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I fell in love with \\"Wicked\\" long before I ever saw it performed, and I thank the wonderful music for that. \\"Wicked\\" boasts being the \\"true story of the Witches of Oz\\", a kind of prequel to L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\". It follows two young women, the popular Galinda Upland and the \\"beautifully tragic\\" (and green) Elphaba Tropp through college and young adulthood, treating the audience to a look at their unlikely friendship and tragic downfalls eventually leading to their titles of \\"Glinda the Good\\" and \\"The Wicked Witch of the West\\", respectfully. The smash musical, which proudly sells out every Broadway show and also boasts productions in L.A., Chicago, and London as well as a National Tour, is based on the book \\"Wicked: The Life and Times of The Wicked Witch of the West\\" by Gregory McGuire. With music by Stephen Shwartz (\\"Pocahontas\\", \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\") and the soaring voices of Kristen Chenoweth (\\"Bewitched\\") as Galinda/Glinda the Good and Idina Menzel (\\"RENT\\") as Elphaba/The Wicked Witch, the soundtrack leaves the listener with goosebumps to say the very least. Tracks such as \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\", \\"One Short Day\\" and \\"Wonderful\\" beautifully recapture the spirit of the original \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", although it's the CD's standout tracks such as \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" that truly let the actresses' voices shine. Don't worry about being ruined, either, because the soundtrack was shortened, leaving out key pieces that would give away too much plot while still making the basic storyline understandable. \\"Wicked\\" truly is the best musical of our time, and it may just change you \\"For Good\\"!
B00008977N|5.0|Absolutely well produced, absolutely well done. As a longtime fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite it's overall 'VH-1-ness' - all the 'hits' are represented. There are some genuinely poignant moments, here - and some genuinely (affectionately) cringe-worthy ones, as well (think, 'hand gestures' and 'hipthrusts', and you've got it) - but the joy of it comes through, especially in the title track. A great performance by all - I would expect nothing less from Mr. Gabriel and his merry band. <br /> <br />I mean, you can't beat that VOICE.  <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend.
0060920084|5.0|Bill Bryson was the perfect author for me and may be the perfect author for a lot of people. He has a humorous perspective and always has interesting descriptions of places he visits and can connect to the reader wonderfully.  <br /> <br />In this book, he travels around America in a car in his journey to find the perfect town, nicknamed \\"Amalstad.\\" Along the way he meets interesting people and places. Nothing escapes his commentary as he drives all around America discovering quaint, small towns and also sharing with us the story of big cities.  <br /> <br />Bill Bryson has an uncanny knack for connecting to the reader. His writing is similar to a conversation written down. He relates many of his examples to many things that ordinary people have experienced.  <br /> <br />This book is a must read for anyone. You will be surprised as you learn new things and also laugh at old, all through the eyes of a funny author.
B000002H92|5.0|...this is the one to get.  This album was released in 1991 and was digitally remastered from the original master tapes by Paul A. Rothchild (The Doors' original producer) and Bruce Botnick (The Doors' original sound engineer).  The sound quality of this release is outstanding, particularly in comparison to today's overly compressed mastering and remastering techniques.   <br /> <br />'Aboslutely Live' was The Doors' only live album to be released while Jim Morrison was alive and that album (originally a double disc set on vinyl) is presented almost in it's entirety on Disc One (\\"Close to You\\" has been inexplicably moved to the second disc).  Disc Two opens with the definitive 'An American Prayer' live version of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" before presenting the 'Alive She Cried' album in it's entirety.  The last two numbers on Disc Two are taken from the 'Live at the Hollywood Bowl' video.  \\"Unknown Soldier\\" was previously available on the 'Live at the Hollywood Bowl' EP (now out of print) but the live version of \\"The End\\" from that show had never been available on CD prior to this release. <br /> <br />For a multi million record selling pop band, their live show often skirted their most popular hits in favor of lesser known album tracks, unreleased tracks, covers and epic pieces.  This set is no exception.  Missing from this set are hits like \\"People Are Strange\\" and \\"Touch Me\\" in favor of lengthier pieces like \\"The End,\\" \\"When the Music's Over,\\" and the (at the time) otherwise unreleased \\"The Celebration of the Lizard.\\" <br /> <br />Morrison is at times austere and a times humorous but is always engaging.  The band is a crack unit and genuinely shines on the epic pieces.   <br /> <br />At nearly two and half hours with no repeated songs, this is a great value.
B000002JEV|5.0|Really good CD.  If your a fan of Zepplin then this is a must own.  Remarkable clarity and a different twist to some of the great songs they are known for.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|It is the same model I used in high school, only now it is the 'anniversary edition'.  The HPs are not for everyone though, the input is different from the TI BA calculator.
0812975219|5.0|Fooled by randomness is a very intelligent take on how human beings percieve risk and uncertainty in life. The author provides relevant comparisons from history, philosophy, mathematics to make his point. Read the book cover to cover (the introduction, foreword clarify author's intentions and some misconceptions you might develop while reading). Language and style of writing is smart and fun-filled. The book has the potential to change your attitude and approach to uncertainty; it has changed mine! Looking forward to more from Taleb.
B000J103WK|5.0|OK, so let's talk about the MUSIC and the performance on this Eagles concert HD-DVD. NOTHING BUT AWESOME! Just what I'd expect from these boys. <br /> <br />Twenty-five, or so, songs, performed live with studio-quality sound perfection and  singular performances by each and every member of this beloved American band! The HD-DVD cinematography, lighting, and color is beautiful - almost better than being there. <br /> <br />Pretty much all of the songs you remember and love the eagles for; ya know - Hotel California, Tequilla Sunrise, Take it Easy, .... etc. Some new stuff as well. Joe Walsh sings a good new upbeat tune about zoning through his earlier life due to alcohol. Lots of fun, big excited audience, great horn section, superb backup drummer, guitarist, keyboards. <br /> <br />My only complaint is about the direction with respect to guitar playing - I really wanted to see more about how Walsh and their other awesome guy (don't know his name) made those awesome sounds. Oh well. <br /> <br />Now, about HD-DVD players: I got the XBox 360 HD-DVD add-on. It was sub-standard, IMO. I returned it and got the real deal Toshiba stand-alone HD-DVD player with the independent analog audio inputs (you've got to get the analog surround inputs if you want to really experience HD-DVD sound on the recent Toshiba players). So get real and get a dedicated HD-DVD player and CHECK OUT THOSE EAGLES! <br /> <br />I have a 100\\" screen front projection HD projector, 1200 Watt pioneer sound box, and about $3000 worth of full size 7.1 surround speakers. It rally gets me in the \\"zone.\\" But you don't need this much equipment to enjoy this great Eagles HD-DVD - just a dedicated HD-DVD player. BTW, if you love music, only the HD-DVD standard REQUIRES technically superior sound on each and every HD-DVD released - not so on Blu-Ray. So go HD-DVD.
B00000K3CM|5.0|DVD arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.  I will use <br />Amazon again. Very dependable. Thank you.
1572814349|5.0|I was slow on getting around to this deck from 2003. In this sea of Tarot decks, it is difficult to choose. It seems this is the Golden Age of the Tarot! This deck presents the fascinating world of the late middle ages in painting. I could imagine the work involved gathering these images. <br /> <br />They are wonderful and believable. In other words, they look as if they came from this time period. The glow from the gilded edges is superb and I would recommend these cards for beginners, collectors and art history fans!!!
1582701709|5.0|Absolutely amazing book, opens your eyes to what we should be concentrating on to enrich our lives.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|If you're looking for talent, look no further. Bob Dylan proves his artistic skill yet again--even surpassing his own excellent previous works. This collection of musical arrangements is as diverse as it is consistently excellent. The lyrics are variously thought-provoking, romantic, funny, witty, gentle, challenging, warm, engaging, symbolic, and interesting.<br /><br />My newest fantasy: being seated on a trans-Atlantic flight beside Bob Dylan. I would keep my mouth shut and my ears open. This old guy is brilliant.
1593352816|5.0|I listened to this book on a cross country drive and although it had its faults i really enjoyed the book and will listen to it again
B000002O3I|5.0|A few songs from Moanin' in the Moonlight (Moanin' for My Baby, All Night Boogie, Forty-Four, Baby How Long) aren't exactly all that great, but the rest makes up for it. This is basically a set of blues classics, in fact if Killin' Floor and Sittin' on Top of the World were included you'd think it was a very in-depth best-of. Just look at how many legendary musicians have covered (or ripped off, in Led Zeppelin's case) some of these songs: The Red Rooster, Spoonful, Wang Dang Doodle, Goin' Down Slow, Back Door Man, How Many More Years, Who's Been Talkin'? Smokestack Lightin', Evil, Tell Me or I Asked Her for Water (She Gave Me Gasoline). Most artists are lucky to have two or three legendary songs. Wolf has eleven on this album alone, and this one doesn't even have Killin' Floor, Sittin' on Top of the World or I Ain't Superstitious, also part of legend. But I digress. These original recordings, taken from the old '45s rather than being the remakes spread across his career, pound any cover you can imagine into all hell. Okay, maybe Cream's version of Spoonful beats the original. Maybe not. It's a tough call. But that's beside the point.<br /><br />Okay, blues fans withuut this are simply doing themselves a disservice. But a rock or soul fan looking to trace the music's roots who doesn't own a copy of Howlin' Wolf/Moanin' in the Moonlight is also shooting themselves in the foot. Actually, so is anybody who enjoys good music. Plain and simple.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie has everything you could possibly want.  Steve Carrell is awesome in his role, and no matter who you are, you'll certainly find something amusing in this film.
0066620996|4.0|The fundamental principles of truly well run organizations comes through clearly, and are obviously sound as deduced from the research.  The investigatons naturally include some repetition, and are repeated to insure the ideas are fully covered.  The book could probably have been shorter and still made the points.  Lawrence Haines author of \\"People Are Everything\\". <br />
1594200823|5.0|You will become a vegetarian after reading this book.  It will most definitely open your eyes.
1582701709|5.0|Oh my gosh, this was the best book ever!  For so long now, I have been waiting for it to be my turn.  After reading this book I didn't realize that it was always my turn!  I just had to want it and rid my head of doubt.  Now all of a sudden everything is falling into place.  The world would be a better place if this was required reading!
B000MGUZMU|1.0|Honest to God, what is the fuss about? This stuff sounds like Crash Test Dummies Doing Simple Minds circa 1985. A total mess. Avoid.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|About half way through this movie, I was bored. But I wanted to see what happened. I am glad I watched the whole movie. Harold basically has no life outside of his job. The writers voice makes him a little crazy. So he goes to a literature professor to find out what story he is living. Then he decides to live his life the way he wants to and has some romance with Ann. They were not a believable couple to me. But I guess that is what makes it strange. Worth a rental. Emma Thompson was fabulous.
1582701709|3.0|Byrne appears to have repackaged a very wise concept but makes the mistake that many new agers do-- assume that ALL experience is due to what we attract--the world is within AND without.  (See Carol Pearson's preface to The Hero Within p. xxi in which she discusses the dangers in this assumption.) <br /> <br />That said, visualizing your intent or prayer is incredibly powerful.  See Shakti Gawain's books on Creative Visualization and Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Postive Thinking.  Peale was a minister and is coming from a specifically Christ-centered perspective.  <br /> <br />
B00005J6SZ|3.0|Okay, here we go.  First thing is first.  I am a big fan of getting the years of albums/CD's correct.  Yes, I know this is just reviews and not the judging of one's knowledge or observation of what they type, etc.  I just thought I'd get it to it's correct direction, so to speak.  <br /> <br />1. 'Like A Virgin' was released in 1984, not 1985.  Madonna's debut album/CD 'Madonna' was released in 1982, not 1983. <br /> <br />There, we have that under the bridge now.  :-) <br /> <br />2. I think the album Like A Virgin is overrated, but far from her best material.  I like it okay, and it's listenable, as for I am a major Madonna fan in general, so it's not about what I just like of hers and what I don't like of hers.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, Madonna has never had a so called \\"terrible\\" song or album until she released 'American Life' in the new mellinium.  Yes, I know this review of this specific CD should be typed in that arena, and trust me, it will.  It's not that I can't stand American Life, I think it's just not her style in the least, and that is giving change, as to most artists need that in their long spanned careers.   <br /> <br />I am an artist/musician myself, so don't think I am putting this into a realm without experiencing or knowing somewhat of what is going on in that realm of the music world.  <br /> <br />I absolutely love Madonna and have no qualms with her and/or her music in the very least, but Like A Virgin would be my second to last choice her entire career of CD's that have been put out to date. <br /> <br />I have started reading a lot of reviews on a lot of artists, groups, soloists, etc, and have decided to join the world of typing reviews.  It's fun, intriguing, and most of all insightful for those who need them to either gain the interest or disclude the CD/LP from their collection, etc.   <br /> <br />I respect anyones opinion and choices of music, rather I like the music itself or not.  I have a deep obsession and love for music, and love to hear anyone listening and enjoying the music they choose in their life. <br /> <br />Overall... Madonna rocks, and this album did deserve the popularity it got, but it's just not my favorite of Madonna.  Happy reviewing!  :-)
B00005JKDR|5.0|Disney/pixar have come a long way very quickly. It's sometimes easy to forget John Lassiter's outfit were the architects of the current CGI driven animation we take for granted today in features such as Happy Feet.For me Monsters Inc. is benchmark for the company since the script equally matches the ground breaking animation (Sully's fur, for example).<br /><br />The rapport between Billy Crystal and John Goodman bursts out of their respective Mike and Sully characters.<br /><br />This classic tale takes the monster in the closet premise and turns it into a face paced, quick-firing one liner fest with a deep sense of emotion. But it is the cautionary undertone that challenges us adults not encourage our kids to grow up too soon, that makes this film exceptional. Highly recommended!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I really liked the first DVD at the Helix, but this second one is just fantastic in my estimation.  The 6 soloists really get into your heart and do just a superb job!  The backdrop at the Slane Castle really adds to the ambiance, and the cameras do a great job of capturing close up and all the action.  At the Ceili is my favorite; it's just fun to watch the routine and costumes.  I think what really sells this for me is that everyone genuinely appears to love performing the songs, and the five voices and fiddle are just fantastic by themselves and together they equal more than the sum of the individuals.
B0000025RI|5.0|at the production helm, Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Off the Wall\\" are two of the best pop albums of the 20th century. I don't need to say anything about the music. Everyone around the world has heard it...and so many have loved it. I still love it. Quincy Jones was such a great producer and teaming with Jackson on those two albums was a golden combo.
044661758X|3.0|The Concrete Blonde isn't Shakespeare but as far as what they used to call 'dime store novels' go it is pretty good. The story moves along, the plot takes interesting unexpected twists and the prose usually stays away from the gag reflex.  There are occasional lapses but they are minor. A good book for sitting in an airport or on a boring plane.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder: The Definitive Collection contains great songs by Stevie Wonder that will bring back great memories for us all. Stevie's music shines throughout this CD; it's no wonder that his songs often shot to the very top of the R&B, Pop and Adult Contemporary charts all at the same time!<br /><br />The CD opens with \\"Fingertips (Part 2).\\" Although I was frustrated that the track starts in the middle of the action, this number gives us proof that from the very start Stevie Wonder possessed superstar talent. His rapport with his audience is excellent judging by the way they cheer for Stevie and their back and forth chanting with him is great, too. They even laugh along with Stevie when he becomes somewhat mischievious on the harmonica. The band's backup for Stevie works very well.<br /><br />The stunning and remarkable songs are presented in chronological order on this CD; but of course in my opinion some numbers work even better than others. Some of the wonderful tracks on this CD include the relentlessly upbeat and romantic \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\" with Stevie's great harmonica intro and singing; the musical arrangement just couldn't be better for this ballad. Stevie sings of his undying love for his woman. \\"For Once In My Life\\" continues in this same vein; Stevie celebrates his new love for a lady and he knows intuitively that they will stay together forever. Love those tambourines--and how's about Stevie's harmonica playing once again?<br /><br />\\"My Cherie Amour\\" gives us a more mellow number about a man's unrequited love for a woman; Stevie sings this without a superfluous note. The drums, percussion and strings infuse the melody with a certain romatic style I rarely hear. Awesome! On the other hand, \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\" offers Stevie the chance to sing about his giving his heart to a woman he truly loves after he has taken too much time to make up his mind. The melody is infectiously catchy and the backup chorus works well on \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours.\\"<br /><br />\\"Higher Ground\\" has a beat that showcases an angry side of Stevie Wonder; and \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" lets Stevie rail against then-president Nixon. \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\" has a sensuality to it that makes you remember it almost instantly after you've heard it for the very first time. \\"I Wish\\" lets Stevie reflect on the more carefree days of youth; and \\"Sir Duke\\" represents a fine tribute to the African American artists who came before Stevie.<br /><br />\\"Overjoyed\\" uses the piano, strings and Stevie's voice as instruments to create a very special, romantic and intimate ballad. This number displays the depth of Stevie's love for his woman. \\"Overjoyed\\" is one of the most beauitful love songs I've heard--ever. Stevie sings of his painstaking, difficult search for the woman who will be his perfect soulmate for the rest of his life. He also tries to encourage his one true love to see things the way he does. You will be moved by this ballad.<br /><br />The CD ends just as it began: \\"Part-Time Lover\\" has a distinct pop flavor to it just like \\"Fingertips (Part 2).\\" Stevie sings of his relationship with a woman who has feelings for him--but she may not be completely free to live with Stevie.<br /><br />The liner notes include great art work with pictures of Stevie; and Harry Weinger contributes an essay based on an interview with DJ Scott Regan. You get the song credits, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, something irks me about this CD. I cannot conceive of a \\"definitive collection\\" of Stevie Wonder's hits on a single CD. Many songs should have been added onto a second CD to make this collection truly complete. For example, where's \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" from Songs In The Key Of Life? What about \\"All In Love Is Fair?\\" Where are \\"Lately\\" and \\"Happy Birthday\\" from Hotter Than July? What about \\"Ribbon In The Sky?\\" I could go on; but you get my point. I have to take off at least one star for this; I had a hard time deciding but I think I willmake this a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, this remains a great CD, especially for the casual fan who wants a lot of the very best of Stevie Wonder on a single CD. True blue fans will pick this one up; but they will be more satisfied still with Stevie Wonder CD sets including the four CD set entitled At the Close of a Century.<br /><br />Thank you, Stevie Wonder!but I think I will make this a four star review. <br /> <br />Overall, this remains a great CD, especially for the casual fan who wants a lot of the very best of Stevie Wonder on a single CD.

B000IY06CK|3.0|Sorry, Fischer is a good violinst, but this record is somewhat of a snoozer.  Partly because of the recorded sound.
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Bob Dylan has taken a decidedly different turn in his August years.  His past three albums have all been excellent, including this one.  He has been constantly touring, and documentaries, television specials, and new biographies and introspective books, including one by himself, have all reminded of us of his greatness.  Bob used to be one to shy away from the media, but we have seen him on 60 Minutes, read Chronicles, and watched Scorsese's documentary.  All applauding Bob.  Even this new album is getting rave reviews, often referred to as the best album of the year.  I find it frustrating that this could be the best thing offered for the year.  For one thing is totally lacks creativity and fresh ideas.  Instead, we are treated to a re-hash of old stuff.  Nonetheless, it is well done, and it gives us a chance to see Dylan again.  Personally, I'd like to see him take a chance, do something that might bare a little Bob.  It is good stuff, though.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The real story here is Salieri's relationship with god, though the plot appears to revolve around Mozart. Some artistic license is used throughout the movie, but the performances and the music make up for the historical inaccuracies.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I had much anticipation for this film.  Having grown up with Sean Connery playing James Bond, and having read all of the books several times as a teenager, I've always felt that I had a good pulse for what makes a great Bond movie.  Somewhere along the line, the Bond films became a comic book, a farce, and never more so than when Roger Moore was playing Bond.  Some improvement was made with Timothy Dalton in the starring role, he put some shock and awe into the role, but we regressed again with Pierce Brosnan.  Not that it was Brosnan's fault, indeed, it was the producers who seemed to have lost sight of what made Bond truly memorable.    <br /> <br />Enter Daniel Craig.  After watching Casino Royale, I felt I had seen the best Bond movie since Thunderball.  Bond was back, he was gritty, tough, no nonsense, and not a stupid parody of himself.  But why?  I believe it has to do with Jason Bourne.  Jason Bourne movies gave us everything Bond movies used to give us, without the silly, stupid, tiresome routines, and the predictable, inane special effects.  Bourne fims are just straight ahead action-spy movies.  The Bond people saw in the Jason Bourne films a rival, somebody that could actually supplant Bond as the favorite spy hero.  Suddenly, there was a reason to mess with the formula and do something necessary.  Casino Royale is just that; something necessary.  Not only that, however.  Bond is reborn.  \\"Rebooted\\" is the term I've heard most often, and I agree.  We get a new Bond, a Bond that is not only of the new generation, but a Bond that is ruthless and willing to kill when a better option might be available.  Those of us who have read Casino Royale know that this Bond movie follows the basic plot of the novel better than any Bond movie in thirty years (and it is the first novel, hence a great place to re-boot Bond).  While the first 45 minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the novel, it serves as a basis for the new Bond and an avenue to sign off from theold.  Then the novel's basic plot takes hold and we ride it out.  I've read complaints about the card game taking too long; I say bullocks to that.  The card game in the novel is much of the plot, takes a good long while, and is very suspenseful.  From the point of the card game to the recuperation and discovery of being double crossed by Vesper, the movie is a creative version of the novel's plot.  The last few minutes in Venice deviate, but that's okay, as it works. <br /> <br />And thank the Bond Lord for the best reason to like this movie.  We don't get all of those silly scenes that are in EVERY Bond movie since Goldfinger.  Q was great in Goldfinger and Thunderball, but the redundancy of seeing the comical Q in every film became tired and flat.  Speaking of redundancey, it is possible to take any scene from any post-Thunderball Bond movie and insert it in any other post-Thunderball Bond movie and you'd never know the difference.  Another great thing about this movie is the lack of stupid characters.  Remember the fat County Sheriff that appeared in 2-3 of the Roger Moore films, serving as the basis to install stupid characters in following Bond movies?  We don't have any dumb, fat, Southern sheriffs in this movie.  Thank the Bond Lord for that!  Also, I am a huge fan of Sean Connery and his development of Bond's character.  One of Connery's innovations to the Bond character was the tongue in cheek humor.  Those subtle comments Bond would drop when something happened were originally coined by Connery to the producer's and director's delight.  They became a staple of Bond movies, but by the time Pierce Brosnan took the role, they became the plot.  I can remember watching all of the Brosnan Bond films and waiting for Bond to say a sentence that wasn't some corny, stupid comment on the state of a scene.  Bond had become a parody of himself.  Those comments are held to a minimum in Casino Royale, much to the benefit of the plot and the overall story.   <br /> <br />This is a Bond movie worth watching over and over (I've watched it three times, and I've had it only a week), and owning the DVD will allow you to do just that.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys James Bond, spy movies, action films, adventure films.  You get to travel the world, watch beautiful women, handsome men, daring do, and visit with an old friend.  What could be next for Bond?  I can only hope they will re-make all of Roger Moore's Bond films. I'd even be up for a re-make of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, as George Lazenby just didn't cut it.  The Brosnan and Dalton films are not original stories, so they can do whatever they want with them, but I see no need for re-makes.   <br /> <br />As I stand at the podium, I'd like to thank, not my mother or my dad, but Jason Bourne for giving the producers of the Bond films some incentive to put Bond back on track.
B00008CLOA|5.0|First of all, I have to say that the original copy I received of this was defective near the end of the disc and unfortunatly for me the replacement sounds a tad less great than the original(the bass seemed more up front on the original defective copy)but this is kind of nitpicking I guess. I should also add that some of the other instruments on my new copy seem more up front than on the defective copy. However, to me after owning just about all the other copies out there, this to me, sounds the best. This is my favorite Floyd along with Meddle(so when do we get the SACD of that?). I know some people aren't too happy with the SACD versions but I think they're great. It's funny, but I'm usually the one who complains about favorite albums being changed when there released on cd but I just don't see why anyone wouldn't like this version. Believe me I'm very nitpicky when it comes to cds esp. favs but this one rocks out loud.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I love the whole rocky series!Part 5 is my least favorite but I still like it.This one to me is one of the best out of the series.I will always miss burges merideth as micky though.I thought the plot was well done and the acting suberb.And the views on life in general,never give up and believe in yourself and what you believe in.great movie!And the fight is simply awesome how they done it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is best sci-fi classic of all time, have it this version, the newer original DVD and even VHS.  DVD's are part of the past, the only way I would purchase it in the future - is Blu-ray. Please come out and I would pre-order it as soon as it available.  This is 30th anniversary of Star Wars and Blu-ray version needs to come out. <br /> <br />No need for special popup, just high quality video and audio - Please have DTS HD MA 7.1 on this movie in the future. That is only thing these movies are missing excelient high definition and DTS sound.

B000002IM7|5.0|Funny to listen to this again after so many years. Lotsa great tracks and the songs just get better and better the more you listen. You can really hear the influence Kings X must have had on Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden, etc. \\"In the New Age\\" alone has elements borrowed by each if those bands. \\"Far, Far Away\\" has some of the best vocals dUg has ever done and the key change coming out of the bridge is just sick. \\"Shot of Love\\" hasn't aged well though, sounds pretty geigh, but is the only blemish on a great record that started the whole \\"D\\" tuning craze.
B00003BDXG|1.0|it amazes me that people give this mushroom eater money to make crapola like this. <br />I usually like Harrrelson, J. Lewis is (very often) terrific in everything she does--but here, man, both are UN-NATURAL, stiff--and not to be taken serious at all. Nothing that happens in this flick has a flicker of believability. <br />I'd say this is another one for the trash--except I have way too much respect for the late, great Rodney Dangerfield to do that. Too bad his appearance is nothing more than a cameo here. <br /> <br />Lastly, I liked Platoon just fine when I saw it many years ago; it was right on the mark, authentic...however, this effort here is one, big, bogus mess. It seems  somebody's had too damn many mushrooms...or something.
B00005JPGO|3.0|Leonardo Di Caprio, a diamond mercenary with a British accent - weird. The guy's just too boyish, insufficiently rugged or 'toughed' for this role (although I thought he pulled off his character in The Departed very nicely). Jennifer Connelly looking too pretty for a war-torn context (better was Monica Bellucci, another bombshell ducking bombs in Tears of the Sun). Djimon Hounsou intimidatingly genuine in his role as desperate father. His Oscar nomination is no surprise. <br /> <br />DiCaprio, Hounsou, Connelly, diamonds - and lots and lots of blood in Africa. <br /> <br />Blood Diamond is an attempt to get people to wake up to reality of death, atrocities, bloodbaths and refugees in Africa. A reality shunned by the Western politics, financed by Western corporatocracy, and glossed over by the Western media (there's a good line by Connelly's character when she sees a million-inhabitant refugee camp and states that we'll only get a glimpse of it in CNN, \\"somewhere between Sports and Weather\\"). <br /> <br />The movie opens with Solomon Vandy (damn good name, IMO) being kidnapped from his family to work in diamonds run by the Revolutionary United Front. The RUF are  anti-government rebels whose modus operandi seems to be pillaging and burning villages, chopping off hands (so the people can't vote - now that's new), shooting women and children, and enslaving able-bodied men (there's some black comedy in how the RUF commanders, overseeing their prisoners breaking their backs sifting for diamonds in the rivers and just before shooting people point-blank, can say, \\"Here, there are no masters and slaves!\\") <br /> <br />On account of a government attack on the mines, Vandy is imprisoned but only after he managed to bury a huge diamond he found. This secret can't be kept entirely and he's later set free by Archer who's determined to get the diamond himself. The deal is that Vandy helps Archer in return for assistance in finding his family. Along comes Bowen, a journalist who wants to expose the truth about the illegal diamond trade and whose help Archer and Vandy needs to make it to the site where the diamond was buried. <br /> <br />Somewhere between all this (and the reasonably predictable ending - don't tell me you think everyone's going to get rich, be heroes and live happily after?) you get Archer saying \\"Huh?\\" a hundred times (which served to be more of a distraction than much else).  <br /> <br />You get great shots of bazooka-inspired destruction and other intense battle scenes of the civil war. You get Archer making the all-too-familiar quote, last made by Bruce Willis in Tears, about how God has \\"already left Africa\\". You get half a dozen mini-pep talks about how nothing can be done to resolve the situation (and serious cliches like, \\"Why are our own people doing this to each other?\\"). You'll also get a half-chilling new acronym, TIA, the meaning of which I'll leave it to you to find out.  <br /> <br />You get an unrealistic half-romance between Archer and Bowen (who, like I said, looks way too LA-girl-who-wants-to-make-a-diff for this movie). Quite unexpected is the violent indoctrination by the RUF of children kidnapped from villages (think of Kurt Russell's Soldier with a lot less technology, fashion and suave) which included front-lining the next village massacre, being forced to take drugs, gambling - all a growing boy needs, huh? <br /> <br />The sad thing is there'll be charity in hell before countries who can afford to give aid do so in reasonable amounts. And even if they do, Africans themselves can't seem to eliminate the (tribal?) proclivity to occasionally wipe each other out. <br /> <br />How can the diamond trade be made to bring real development to their source-countries? How can the violence be ended? How can big corporations be made to serve the Third World instead of the opposite? And - probably the most important question raised by the film - how do we get people to give a damn?
B000EWBKKI|5.0|I bought this movie because I'm a fan and it is one of my top five action movies of all time.  I wanted to see this film at it's best on bluray and I was not disappointed.  The picture and sound is awsome.  The commentary by James Cameron is a treat, one the most interesting commentarys I've listend to.  It lacks some of the extras that dvd versions may have contained, but the bluray transfer of of the movie is superior to the dvd version.  Finally, I can enjoy a sharp picture on my wide screen.

B000687M48|4.0|I love just about any song by Evanescence and Amy Lee.  There is something about her voice that captivates me.  It's haunting & filled with emotion.  And the band's sound brings it to it's fullest potential!
B00005JPMC|4.0|Former marksman Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) was the best in the biz, and could say no to any simple mission. It changed when his partner, Donnie Fenn (Lane Garrison), was killed by unsuspecting forces. Three years after that event, he's called back into the fray by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to stop an attempt on the president's life. It seemed like an easy job, but as soon as the president was killed, Swagger takes the fall. Now on the run, he must rely on FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena), Donnie's finacee Sarah (Kate Mara), and a whole mess of guns.    Shooter, directed by Antoine Fuqua (who helped nab Denzel Washington his Golden Globe for \\"Training Day\\"), is quite a little humdinger. It stars Mark Wahlberg (fresh off his major role in \\"The Departed\\"), has the trappings of a classic piece of action cheese (heart-pounding explosions, cheesy bad guys, and the female lead getting down to her skeevies), and is coming out after a major success story that was \\"Breach\\", another political potboiler. But it's also a great time at the movies.    As long as you overlook all the elements of a political thriller (backstabbings, plot twists, jargon, the works), there is some gold to be found in \\"Shooter\\". Fuqua has tight direction when it comes to the action scenes, throwing in well-directed explosions that are more than just excuses for cheap thrills (example: Seagger planting gas grenades at places where he would expect enemy soldiers to stop at), Swagger's expert attempts to disable gunmen (especially in the finale, which will really drive your adrenaline nuts), and solid shot transitions that don't move so fast (unlike in a previous Fuqua bomb, the Jamie Foxx action-comedy \\"Bait\\").    It all works so good that I wished Fuqua would put that much effort into the political jargon. While it doesn't get too anxious at the first couple arcs, Fuqua wants to make the movie mean something when it comes to the last arc's plot twists. It's obvious that certain government individuals are dirty right off the bat, yet Fuqua wants to pull off wrap the film off by neatly wrapping up a few subplots, rendering a subtle performance by Danny Glover into a purely hissable bad guy, though not as bad as the guy who rapes Sarah (it's not too gut-wretching, but it is gratuitous and unnecessary). I give credit for Fuqua's ability to cut to another superb sequence of pure supsense, as well as a great performance by Mark Wahlberg (who adds a considerable amount of character layers to register him as a marksman), that many faults can be easily forgiven.    Another fault is the love interest. Kate Mara, I hate to say it to any fans out there, is not that great an actress. When her character tells Swagger not to feel bad about her ex-fiancee's demise, it comes off as silly. While Fuqua does let Mara's role weave into the plot, one couldn't help but feel that Shooter would've been better without a love interest, especially cause both Bob and Sarah don't have an intimate moment (sex scene aside, they should at least indicate that they've fallen for each other). It's a little quibble, and doesn't harm the pace.    In movies these days, a single plot twist can send the film off balance after minutes of rambunctious entertainment. Fuqua, thankfully, doesn't succumb to this in \\"Shooter\\", and the last act will guarantee to have your knuckles white as ever. As in every movie, as long as you can ignore the ludicrous story, you'll find that \\"Shooter\\" is an action fan's birthday present.
032147404X|5.0|I love photography, but I'm certainly nothing more than an amateur with a DSLR.  Like many others, I found that after switching from a point and shoot camera, I knew even less than I thought, and all those \\"extra\\" settings and feature actually meant something.  Plagued with \\"How Do I...\\" questions, I first turned to the camera's manual and then to \\"replacement\\" manuals written by people \\"in the know\\".  That just solidified the realization that I need to take a class.  But until I get around to that, I still have a camera, a desire to take better photographs, and a lot of questions.<br /><br />Enter this title.  By the time I was done with just the first chapter, I already had answers to not only existing questions, but quite a few I didn't realize I had.  The subsequent 10 chapters were no less informative and vital to beginners.  Don't let the compact, picture-intensive,  200+ page size of the book fool you - the information is spot on, in layman terms, and demonstrating real-world methods and practices that are simple to understand and duplicate.  The writing style is casual and humorous, but not clogged with unnecessary fluff.  Throughout the book the author makes equipment recommendations, and although I typically resent books that have any product endorsements, the author presents only \\"generic\\" recommendations at various price ranges; equipment that you'll want to seriously consider once your discover that the results you want are accomplished using that equipment.<br /><br />I'll still take a class, but with this title under my belt, I feel confident putting it off a little longer, and perhaps skipping the \\"intro\\" courses.  This book has found a spot in my camera gear and already proved invaluable on more than a few occasions.
B00005RDRO|5.0|My daughter and I have loved this movie since she was little and we still catch ourselves quoting our favorite lines from the movie!  It is such a great spoof on old detective movies and there are so many of our favorite, big stars in it!  It is really a fun movie!
4789009637|5.0|Ok, I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on Japanaese language learning materials. Books, software, CDs etc. Some of them good some of them bad. Genki is the only one that has really put it all together for me. It explains the concepts and explains them well. When you are done reading the grammar sections it just starts to make sense.  <br /> <br />This is a great stepping stone for those that are wanting to learn Japanese as part of a fuller understanding of the language. If you are looking for a quick read for a weekend in Tokyo this book isn't for you.  <br /> <br />Pick up the workbook and CD if you are going to be doing this solo. It'll help out like you wouldn't believe.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Where to begin with a film like Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA? It's both a famous and infamous example of world cinema in its heyday (the 1960's, mostly), working hard to stretch the medium past traditional or straightforward storytelling. It's famous, of course, because it was directed by Ingmar Bergman, the legendary Swedish film director (THE SEVENTH SEAL, WILD STRAWBERRIES), featured two of his acting mainstays Bibi Andersson and Gunnar Bjornstrand and introduced Liv Ullmann, who would figure prominently in both Bergman's personal life and professional career. It's infamous because it is usually regarded as a \\"difficult\\" film, subject to much critical commentary and debate (which is exactly the kind of response a great film should generate, right?). Was it Susan Sontag who said this was, by and large, a modernist vampire story? I don't know if I agree, but this gives some idea of the range of critical dispute.    After a short but enigmatic prologue, the film opens up into a accessible narrative: that of an actress named Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullman) who mysteriously falls silent during a stage performance of Medea (a meaningful play choice in the context of the film) and thereafter will not speak. She is sent to a hospital/clinic where she is assigned to an enthusiastic, inexperienced nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson). The doctor sends Alma and Elisabeth to her seaside home as a sort of \\"therapy,\\" where their new friendship gathers an intensity which leads, ultimately, to psychological warfare and strange and symbolic happenings. If this sounds vague, well, that's mainly because the latter part of the film is difficult to summarize (especially without including one's own interpretation of what's \\"actually\\" going on).    One thing to notice in PERSONA is its indebtedness to dramatic forms: that is, stage performance. It is certainly no accident how much of the film feels very spare and theatrical. In the hospital, for instance, we see only three persons, Elisabeth, Alma, and the doctor. The hospital rooms are very empty and look, quite consciously, like a stage set. Although the prologue and epilogue include, fleetingly, a few other actors, only four actors have significant roles in the film--two of which dwarf the other two. All of this points very specifically to the notions of art and drama, and more generally, to the that of artifice versus truth; we are intended to sense the artificial structures of the film because they contribute largely to the film's meaning: What constitutes truth? Are we ever, properly speaking, not acting in some way? Can we refuse to participate in the drama of life or are we actors, whether willingly or not?    Let me add that PERSONA is not a characteristic Bergman film by any means. It is far more stylistically adventurous than most of his other films and seems to mark a break of sorts with the chamber dramas of the early 1960's, although there is a certain affinity with THE SILENCE, the final enigmatic film in the \\"religious trilogy.\\" What I am saying is that, if you know and like THE SEVENTH SEAL or MONIKA or SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, don't expect such austere storytelling in PERSONA, which is a forceful film partially because it can't quite be critically resolved.

B000001ES9|4.0|It's almost hard to imagine how Neil Peart was not yet a member of Rush when they made their debut album. Sure, the Peart influence is not heard on this recording, but Geedy Lee and Alex Lifeson(and the original drummer)were still young lads exploring their individual talents and putting them together on an album for the first time. For 1974, most bands new or old couldn't help but sound like what was most popular, and the Pink Floyd influence is detected on \\"Here Again.\\" There's also a lot of Led Zeppelin similarities in most of the songs, but as we know now, Rush eclipsed Led Zeppelin through the years to become a solid band with tremendous talent and originality, and their signature sound is not absent from this recording when you listen to the guitar licks on the opening track \\"Finding My Way,\\" and of course \\"Working Man,\\" one of the greatest radio anthems of all-time with an amazing guitar jam that can't be compared to anything else.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|It still baffles me why this brilliant movie was not chosen for Best Picture...or why this isn't a two-disc set (which is why I'm only giving the product 4 stars instead of 5). For such a ground-breaking movie, it really seems like the studio backing it isn't giving it the boost it truly deserves.<br /><br />Children of Men has the amazing ability to take you out of your environment, and totally emmerse you in the world. The storytelling, and pacing are fantastic, but what really stands out is the cinemetography. A lot of the time there is absolutely no dialogue, and the director relies heavily on the actors, special effects, and situations to express the feeling of the scene...and you feel every step, as if you were right there.<br /><br />Absolutely brilliant from start to finish. Agaian, I can't stress enough how much more this movie should've been advertised and pushed, but wasn't for some unknown reason. Also, this DVD deserves a 4-disc set...even a 2-disc set at the very LEAST. However, for whatever reason, they've decided to package it with one disc, and skimped on the extras.<br /><br />However, even with that said, this is a truly extraordinary movie which anyone should see.

Asimov was certainly one of the great sci-fi writers and it's very true that good movies often come from good sources and good stories. <br />Will Smith stars as a cop in 2035 Chicago who is a robot hater. The robots soon give him good reason to hate and we're on our way to a robot vs. humans battle.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This action-packed modern day retelling of Bond's beginnings as a double-0 agent has everything someone could look for in a movie. I am an oldschool Bond fan and didn't like alot of the recent Bond movies as much, but this one just blew me out of the water. Daniel Craig makes for an excellent Bond and the movie's plot and progression will not dissappoint action movie fans or even those who read the book by Flemming.
0374105235|5.0|I think that this is a must read.  We in the USA live in a never-never-land compared to most of the world.  I think that we have a moral obligation to be present to the horror that exists in other parts of this planet.

B000MNP2KI|1.0|I will be perfectly honest here: I came into Casino Royale expecting it to be decent, but I wound up being horribly disappointed. The acting and action were fine, but nearly everything else they got wrong. <br /> <br />Where's the cool Bond gadgets? The sweet-looking Bond car is driven exactly once, and he totals it in moments of getting out of the parking lot. <br /> <br />There are some decent action scenes, but the whole plot is just disconnected and hard to follow. We start in Prague, where Bond makes his first two kills ever, but this has nothing at all to do with the real plot line. Then on to another scene with Bond pursuing some bombmaker on foot for a good 15 minutes. And he had to be the most nimble bombmaker alive, to be able to scale vertical walls and take absurdly long falls without slowing down. Bond states plainly at the beginning that he wanted the guy alive. Yet at the end of the chase, he winds up killing him anyway. Then off to the Bahamas to sneak around, and to Miami airport to thwart some guy trying to blow up a plane in another absurdly long action scene. <br /> <br />Bond is then bankrolled by the MI-12 to play a poker tournament, in the hopes that this bad guy won't win and so won't be able to repay his debts to other bad people. Sound convoluted? Well, it is. There is a whole mini-movie spent on the poker scenes, which at first I thought was a pleasant surprise. But, I have to point out that they got a lot wrong in the Texas Hold `em coverage. <br /> <br />Bond at one point, out of the blue, suggests to \\"double the blinds\\", which is agreed to by one other player, and it is actually done at that point in the tournament. This is simply wrong and not how the game is played in real life. You have set intervals where the blinds are doubled - otherwise, somebody low on chips would be disadvantaged. <br /> <br />Further, Bond has a habit of splashing the pot with all-in's, which should've made the dealer furious. This is quite comical in the lasthand of the game, where 4 people are \\"All In.\\" Each person goes in for more than the previous, and Bond and the last guy dump all their chips in the main pot. There should've been side pots, otherwise the dealer couldn't know who to pay what, in the event had Bond not won. <br /> <br />There's all kinds of double crossing, and a gratuitous torture part involving Bond's wanker. Of course, in the very next scene, he's back having sex again. Then, there's the guy supposedly carrying around $150 million in a briefcase. Did the bank print up special bills or something so that they fit? Then, the briefcase gets dropped into the rushing flood waters inside an imploding building. Yet, moments later, we see some random bad guy walk off with the case, completely dry. You have to really stretch to believe this rubbish. <br /> <br />Casino Royale wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's by far the worst movie I've seen this year.
0812932293|4.0|Richard Branson's story is at once inspiring and eyebrow raising. This tale really let's you see how it was that Richard Branson became the world stage persona he is today, and the steps (and stumbles) by which it happened. Especially revealing are his relationship with his family, and the manner in which he siezes opportunities, sometimes at the cost of all else. Mr. Branson pulls no punches on himself. He explains the mistakes he's made and the trouble he's brought himself in various situations, as well as his severe difficulties with the things we are taught as necessary for success-- like school. This book is an eye opener for the way things are supposed to work vs. the way the really do work. This is not the best edited book I've ever read, but it is one of the most enlightening.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|This is an interesting album, even for Clutch. While it lacks the lyrical and thematic edge of Robot Hive Exodus, it makes up for in pure southern rock foot stomping goodness. This album makes it harder to stay in your seat than any of their previous offerings. The earlier tracks such as \\"Can't Stop Progress\\" and \\"Power Player\\" hearken back to Clutch's heavier roots, while \\"The Devil & Me\\" and \\"Electric Worry\\" take them even farther into their new southern sound. \\"Electric Worry\\" is an instant classic and easily one of the band's best songs to date. The latter tracks dive back into Fallon's trademark lyrical style (\\"When Vegans Attack\\" and \\"Black Umbrella\\" are particularly entertaining) and sound more like a solid Clutch live set than any of their previous studio efforts. Their blues influence is more noticeable on this album and smoothly integrated into their sound, especially with Mick's organ work and Fallon's harmonica. Clutch's gearhead fans from their early days who have been displeased with the southern direction of their sound will probably not like this album - it's clear the 'rock fury' days are past. Fans of Clutch's newer direction will love it, as will anyone who enjoys their live shows. This is a great album.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I was in attendance at this concert--a pretty long day (INXS, the Alarm, Status Quo, then finally Queen) but worth the wait.  Freddie had the entire stadium in his hands that night; watch a master at work!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|This charming movie is clearly trying to paint a rosy picture of how well the EU can work despite the challenges of different ethnic identities and halfwitted British neo-hooligans. (In case the viewer doesn't pick up on this, the message is made quite explicit by film's end.)<br /><br />But despite this pamphleteering, I didn't mind a bit. The fact that \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" can turn a skeptical smirk into an open smile is a credit to how appealing the movie is. It's foolish, naive, and our protagonist learns an unrealistic number of \\"life lessons\\" in a year's time. No matter: Bravo!<br /><br />TRIVIA: This film was released in England under the name \\"Pot Luck.\\" And it was originally going to be saddled with the unmarketable title \\"European Pudding.\\"
0895260131|3.0|The book is informative but very repetitive.  The author is very effective in getting his point across in the first two chapters.  Unfortunately, it is much of the same for the rest of the first half of the book.  The same goes for the second half of the book on the Crusades.  I would say, it is worth a read (but only for a couple of the chapters).
1582701709|5.0|I love this book!  I have been working with this concept for most of my life and have read/studied a variety of books and attended several seminars regarding the information contained in this book.  This book is easy to read and to put to use.  I highly recommend it!
B00005JPO8|5.0|This gripping, transcendent political thriller is altogether extraordinary.  It is everything I want a movie to be and it accomplishes what great art should, and rarely does - one emerges from the theatre a changed person, and maybe even a better one.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Everyone I know warned me that this movie had too much blood and guts to be entertaining. I really must not be aware of my friends' sensibilities or I have become innured to the real world. For that is what this story is about - the real world. Yes, undercover can be dangerous. Very dangerous. But at last we have a real look at the evil world that surrounds us. Fast pace keeps the viewer interested, twists and turns keep the viewer riveted, and the ending will blow the viewer away! Highly recommended for those who can stand the sight of blood!
B00007AJF8|3.0|YES!  This film is unusual--it breaks out of conventional time and space reality--maybe that's its main gift.  The idea is terrific---what it's like to spend 15 minutes being someone else---in this case a famous and succesful movie actor.  The choice of actor fits in with the general motif---John Malkovich---who is, I think most people would agree--a little off-center, himself.  They didn't chose Tom Cruise (now that would be interesting) or Robert Redford or Brad Pitt....but John Malkovich..??!  <br />  <br /> It could have developed into something really illuminating.  (like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)  But it dropped the ball somewhere and ended up being just a mess. The idea of the old people needing Malkovich's body was grotesque...and then the idea of using the child's body was even worse.  (shades of Rosemary's Baby)  <br /> <br />It's essentially a heartless movie...no one really cares about anyone besides himself, with the possible exception of the Cameron Diaz character who, at least, cares about her animals.  The John Cuzak character, our \\"hero\\" is likable at first, as the hapless puppeteer, but he doesn't lose a moment to go after the snazzy new lady at work (Catherine Keener).  No one grew, no one learned anything, and, at the end I really didn't care about any of them, least of all, John Malkovich. <br /> <br />If you're really impressed by the fact that this is unconventional, and a lot of reviewers here are....then you may love this.  Love?  A funny word for such a loveless story.   <br /> <br />My DVD gave me the treat of an interview with Spike Jonze, who pulls over the car to vomit.  I guess this is supposed to be really really funny... <br /> <br />The reason I gave it any stars at all was for the originality of the concept, and the excellent cast.  It was great to see Mary Kay Place again (and Orson Bean!!)  Cameron Diaz was very good and Catherine Keener was terrific.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001CNRBG|2.0|Ellen Burstyn gives a good performance, especially in the last two segments, where she is excellent. <br /> <br />But for the first time I found an Alan Alda performance to be disappointing. He is pretty one-note throughout the movie. Except for makeup and wardrobe changes he is essentially unchanged from segment to segment. <br /> <br />My wife and I were looking forward to the different periods, and changes in the characters as they aged. Unfortunately much of the period flavor consists of nothing more than the first cliche or two that would pop into your head when a specific year is mentioned. (In particular, the 1966 segment is unbelievable and pretty much unwatchable.) <br /> <br />Ellen Burstyn, at least, does a good job of portraying a woman of different ages (with the exception of the 1966 segment, which even she couldn't salvage.) <br /> <br />I guess I could sum up the problem of this movie for my wife and I by saying that it never seemed that we were watching two real people who were in love, but just two actors who were mouthing, with various degrees of success, some very brittle dialog from the typewriter of a playwright.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I like the old super villans. I liked how the old villans would try to take over a country with an army of super powered mutants. In Casino Royale, the villan was much more believable. Lanudering money to support war lords and rebel factions is something that an MI-6 agent would combat, although not James Bond style. I really wanted to see a movie that would expose a massive network of villans that have coridated a mulit-national effort to destroy/contaminate a massive fresh water supply like the Kinneret (Israel's water supply). But I guess things like that can't really happen after Austin Powers already made fun of it. <br /> <br />And I did really like the new James Bond and nearly everything else in the movie except for the ending. For me, it seemed like it should have continued on, but no. That was it, and it was really screaming (to me) to show who the big bad guy on top was.  <br /> <br />But all in all, MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. These are my opinions, not yours... <br /> <br />:)
067003830X|5.0|Neuroplasticity has recently become a bit of a buzzword. Long the preserve of neuroscientists, this is one of a number of new books on the topic written for the public.<br /><br />I recently reviewed Sharon Begley's superb book - Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain - and this one is in a similar vein. Though it is rather different from Sharon's book in which the main focus was on the changes wrought in the brains of meditators, while this one looks at the extraordinary responses of the brain to injury or congenital absence of sensory organs. Since this book went to press, yet another study, this time from India, has shown that some blind children may be able to regain their sight, an observation that is helping turn a lot of neurology on its head.<br /><br />Neuroplasticity is a topic of enormous practical importance. The increasing evidence that the brain is a highly adaptable structure that undergoes constant change throughout life is a far cry from the idea that we are simply the product of our genes or our environment. Our genes help determine how we can respond to the environment; they do not make us who we are. And we all have untapped potential. This is more than the old nature/nurture debate in a new bottle. It has implications for human potential: how much can you develop your own brain and mind? Can you really teach a child to be a kind, loving person who can dramatically exceed his or her potential? Can psychotherapy really help change your brain for the better? Can we help re-wire the brain of a psychopath? Do we have the right to try?<br /><br />The author is both a research psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst who has interviewed many experts in the field. His book is full of well chosen and detailed stories about scientists and their discoveries as well as case reports of triumph over unbelievable adversity. There is also a good discussion of people who have remarkable abilities despite the absence of key regions of the brain.<br /><br />This book is a good complement to Sharon Begley's and if you can afford it, then I strongly recommend that you get both books. If your interest is more in personal development and its effects on the brain, then Sharon's book will be the one for you. If you are more interested in the science and anecdotes about scientists and some amazing patients, then this book may be the one to go for.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Richard G.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this newest version of the classic story of this passionate woman trapped in her classbound society.  Though not always true to the novel in words and actions, it seems true to its spirit.  The newest interpretation of the heroine stresses her inner life, her struggles with her place in the world, her looks, her morals, etc.  She is the most expressive Jane Eyre yet.  She is not the prim and righteous Jane from much of the novel and as interpreted by Samantha Morton in the ealier A&E version, but rather a quiet and luminous but extremely passionate young woman.  Morton's earlier rendition also made Jane too sure of herself, almost prissy.  There was also little onscreen passion with Ciaran Hinds.  Though he looks more the part of Mr. Rochester in his age and ferocious looks, he did not engage with authentic passion and sensitivity in his role, as Toby Stephens does.  Stephens is too young and handsome for the part, but his growing acquaintance and passion toward Jane is wonderfully intepreted (those side glances!).  Even though this film oversteps the Victorian boundaries of acceptable behavior (and Jane's own moral codes) at times, it does adapt her intensely emotional and ambitious nature repressed by convention expertly.  The setting is wonderfully gothic and the new emphasis on oft-downplayed elements such as Bertha Mason (nice angle shots from her perspective of Rochester's newest rivals for his affection) and the gypsy meeting (hard to do this melodrama but this film pulls it off).  The least believable segment is the remembered parting scene between Jane and Rochester after his crime is revealed, but I like the way the film intersperses Jane's memories in that rather dreary third episode, always a downer after the exciting Thornsfield segments.  All in all, a wonderful adaptation of the story in spirit and atmosphere.
0375831002|5.0|Agreed the author uses an unusual style of presentation, which is one of the strengths of this story. It's the uniqueness of Death's narrative to tell the story that is part of what fascinates - at least for me.  Well worth the time to read.
B000002MG1|5.0|I started out high school as a bit of a metalhead.  Can you blame me?  I was skinny, awkward, shy and had a minor case of acne that seemed worse to me than it probably was.  The only thing I had over anyone as far as I could tell was that my music ROCKED harder.  Thankfully I grew up fast, got through all of that and actually had semi-decent taste in music by Junior year.<br /><br />This album came out around then.  When I first saw it and heard tracks playing in the local record shop (conveniently located between the school and home) I didn't like it, it didn't ROCK.  A friend of mine recommended it for me, telling me I looked like Michael Stipe (yeah kinda, less so since he shaved his head) but I instead opted for a disc by Seattle's Green River that day.  It wasn't until Monster came out that I really got the REM bug because it ROCKED and like I have mentioned, my tastes kinda veered that way.<br /><br />It wasn't until college that I really \\"got\\" this album, which was by that time several years old.  It was compelling, especially the opener \\"Drive\\" (probably the most ominous-sounding slow ballad I have ever heard) and \\"Man on the Moon\\" which everyone loves for obvious reasons.  The rest didn't stick with me as much, although never did I dislike it.<br /><br />I kind of forgot about REM and moved onto other things.  By the time I went through my second great REM phase in 2001 or so, all these earlier albums of theirs were already classics.  I was hung up on Murmur, still their best I think, and the other earlier stuff.  I regretted Michael's steady climb to dominance of the band's sound, as every album distanced him further from the murky mysterious mumblings of the early years.  But then recently I kind of rediscovered this one and have been blown away.<br /><br />Each song is meticulously crafted, each sentiment legitimate and real.  It possesses an ominous, hovering feeling reminiscent of the earlier work but also fresher, more up-front.  It became the new blueprint for their sound, and even though Monster wasn't so great, New Adventures in Hi-Fi (the rightful successor to this one) was.  I hear that Michael is now looking to creat the \\"Great American Record\\" (nobody ever accused him of having any tendency towards modesty)...well, I can say he's already done so here.  Truly a masterwork and I am sorry I've slept on it for so long.  Life'll do that to you.<br /><br />-HWhe new blueprint for their sound, and even though Monster wasn't so great, New Adventures in Hi-Fi (the rightful successor to this one) was.

B00004U8H4|5.0|Who is Patrick Bateman?<br /><br />A valid question for those reading this review.  One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill - kill - and kill again.  Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know.  Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman.  For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer.  Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within.  Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again.  His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw.  Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.<br /><br />Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero.  Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard.  The biggest question is Paul Allen.  The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.  Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship - yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.  Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise.  Yet, something nags at our belief.  This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again.  Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.  Slasher film?  Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery.  There was a film entitled \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, \\"American Psycho\\" can do it like no other.<br /><br />For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s - than \\"American Psycho\\" is the film for you.  For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community.  Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding.  His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character - he was Patrick Bateman.  What is it with Bale - there hasn't been one underscored performance yet.  \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"The Prestige\\", \\"Velvet Goldmine\\", and the \\"Machinist\\" are all within my top films of all time.  \\"American Psycho\\" ranks above them all.  Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones.  The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis.  The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history.  The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes.  Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill  known as Christian Bale.<br /><br />I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.  As I watch this film for the dozenth time, I cannot find errors in the filmmaking.  Perhaps there errors with continuity, but I don't pay attention.  I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.  I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc.  I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story.  Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry - there is a newer version, the \\"Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition\\" that should remedy all of these missing elements.<br /><br />Overall, \\"American Psycho\\" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time.  While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant.  I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing.  The music is what stood out in my eyes.  There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston.  I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.  It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.  \\"American Psycho\\" is a look within the business soul.  As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the \\"Wall Street\\" arm, could  Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father?  The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity - all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.  For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America - this is the film for you.<br /><br />Now, I gotta go return some videos.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****nown as Christian Bale. <br /> <br />I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.

0060589469|2.0|You would think a book about motorcycle maintenance and zen would be a very down to earth kind of read but a huge majority of the book is spent on philosophic meanderings and metaphysical mysticism.  As many people have said the ideas in this book aren't exactly new these days but that's not the author's fault since he wrote it over 30 years ago.  The problem is that he's taken very simple concepts and made them ridiculously complex. <br /> <br />In contrast to this book, pick up something by the Dalai Lama about buddhism.  I find it very ironic that while the spiritual leader of Tibet can explain a concept so simply, some guy on a motorcycle wants to tell me about how a dead greek guy's ideas relate to an undefined term called 'quality' that comes before everything else.   <br /> <br />It's just disappointing to me because I was hoping to hear a lot more about motorcycles and how they relate to life and zen but he completely forgets about the bike about a third of the way into the book.

B00000IQW3|4.0|The Last Starfighter was a nice little sci-fi action movie which was revolutionary when it was released due to it's use of an early version of CGI-effects. For 1984 the special-effects was quite new and showed just what was possible in the years to come.<br /><br />The movie itself was a fun and simple sci-fi actioner which owes alot to the arcade shooters which were popular during the 80's. Even the main plotline of the film is pretty much about a video game sent by a benevolent space-faring Star League looking to find a few good Starfighters to save their federation from the danger that is Zur and the Kodan Armada. Lance Guest plays Alex Rogan whose only past-time at the trailer-park where he lives with his mother and younger brother is his girlfriend Maggie Gordon (played by 80's genre favorite Catherine Mary Stewart) and constantly playing a video game called The Last Starfighter. Alex's expert skills in beating the game brings about a new wrinkle in his hum-drum life which seems to be going nowhere. A seeming con-man of a salesman by the name of Centauri (played with gusto and energy by Robert Preston) comes out of nowhere and gives him an offer and opportunity that is out of this world.<br /><br />The rest of the film brings about Alex's reluctance to join the Star League as a Starfighter and pilot of the Gunstar fighter. He thinks its all a mistake and that he wasn't signing up for some sort of intergalactic war that may just kill him. Like most action movies Alex will have an epiphany of what his role and destiny must be and, with some reluctance, finally takes the challenge by the controls and goes off to fight Zur and the Kodan Armada with his lone Gunstar and his trusty navigator and all-around lizardman mentor, Grigg (played with equal parts seriousness and fun by Dan O'Herlihy).<br /><br />For those like me who grew up during the 80's and enjoyed watching these simple but fun sci-fi movies The Last Starfighter is quite the blast from the past which still delights and entertains despite the corny dialogue and cheesy effects. The CGI-effects of the Gunstar and the Kodan Armada looks dated but I still can't take my eyes off the screen whenever these early looking CG effects come on. The acting is pretty standard B-movie quality with everyone seeming to have fun with the premise and giving it their all. There's nothing to write the Academy about but in the end the performances do just enough to make the audience like the characters.<br /><br />The Last Starfighter is quite the underrated scifi action movie which should've done better than it did when it first came out. It's since gained a cult following on video and always a welcome sight whenever it comes on cable.

0446677450|5.0|As a high school student, I thought I would not understand this book at all, that it might have difficult financial jargon and complex ideas only understandable to few. However, Robert T. Kiuosaki's explanation and comparison of the educationa and perspectives between the rich and poor provide insightful ideas for anyone to understand. He basically dispells the myth that you have to have a high salary to be rich, shows you that your house is actually a liability than an asset, and that you cannot rely on schools to teach students on how to be financially competent.  <br /> <br />This book is a must read for anyone and everyone.
B000FGGE68|1.0|...and you know when a young man in full testosterone blow finds a film with a hottie like Milla in it to be an incomprehensible waste of time that it REALLY must be a stinker.  <br />Not even worth renting, we saw this upchuck as a first run at Austin's legendary Alamo Drafthouse and walked out wondering why we had bothered.  <br />I'd spare you that, if I could.     <br />
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This is a beautifully-done movie, with interesting connections with (and continuations of) characters from Final Fantasy VII.  And the story of this DVD is definitely interesting, with pretty good acting generally.  But you'll also find extended fight scenes that at least for me were not particularly interesting (even though I recognized some of the moves/abilities/summons from playing the game as a kid).  So I admit I'm surprised this has nearly a 5 star rating - it just wasn't that good to me.<br /><br />In summary, if you're an FF fan, you will probably enjoy renting the movie.  But personally, I didn't like it enough to own it.

B000MGUZMU|4.0|If you thought that Neon Bible should be every bit as good as Funeral, then it's no wonder you are disappointed.  Arcade Fire's last album Funeral is a masterpiece.  It is easily one of the best records of the decade.  It is therefore simply unreasonable and unfair to expect Arcade Fire to match it.  Neon Bible should be judged on its own merits.  While it's no Funeral, it is a fine album, far superior to much of the garbage you could buy and consume.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Keep the Car Running\\" reminds one of \\"On the Dark Side\\" from the Eddie and the Cruisers soundtrack. And some of the songs recall Bruce Springsteen.  No album is made in a vacuum and anyone expecting complete originality from a rock band is not going to find much rock enjoyable.  But Neon Bible is unmistakably an Arcade Fire album.  Whatever their influences might have been, they have made them their own.<br /><br />Arcade Fire was in the unenviable position of creating a follow-up to Funeral.  Had they produced another Funeral, some of us would have been disappointed and would have accused the band of pandering to their fans or running out of ideas.  So the band did something different, and now some of us are upset about the direction they have taken.  The pipe organ in \\"Intervention\\" is there for a reason, and there is no reason why Arcade Fire should limit themselves to the sounds and instruments they used on Funeral.  Again, evaluate Neon Bible on its own merits.  Arcade Fire has produced another beautiful set of songs.  If songs like \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\" and \\"No Cars Go\\" leave you unmoved, you should probably see your doctor for a check-up.<br /><br />There will be only one Funeral.  Just accept it, let the band evolve, and consider yourself lucky for having had the opportunity to hear Neon Bible.  Unless, of course, you don't like anything Arcade Fire has done.  In that case, nothing I can say will help you.
B000OLRH1A|5.0|You know, I wanted to see this because it was nominated for best picture but in a weird way my expectations were not that high.  I anticipated a somewhat preachy newsy type movie that would be a little sanctimonious and maybe boring.  I don't know why I felt that but it must have been some combination of the marketing, the best picture nom in itself and the subject matter.  Everything about it screamed \\"Important\\".  Anyway, I saw it this weekend and it is actually excellent.  This is a great story.  DiCaprio does a great job as a menacing but very human South African mercenary (I think I was not sure this role would be a good match for him), there is lots of action and a moving story at the core. I actually think it was better than The Departed.  So in case you're on the fence about getting it because you think it might be all \\"best picture\\"-y, don't worry about it.  It's a lot of fun too.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|This album is great. it may not be her best, but what do you expect? she just had a baby. but even though she had a baby, she still made an album. i think she might have even recorded some songs while she was pregnant. i don't understand why britney spears couldn't have done what gwen did. she just did stupid things with that bum kevin federline.     Anyway, i think this album is underrated. I noticed that a lot of reviewers gave this album 1 star. i gave it 4 stars because she actually tried and gave it her best effort to make another album. she is very hard working and i respect that. here's my rating for each song:    1. Wind It Up- 1st single. catchy song. very upbeat. contains a sample of \\"the lonely goatherd\\" from the movie \\"the sound of music\\". this song flopped on the radio, but that doesn't make it a bad song. 4/5    2. The Sweet Escape- 2nd single. the best on the album. i knew this song would be the next single when i first listened to it. it sounds like something you would hear in the 60s, and it also kind of sounds like something she would do with no doubt. if you don't like this song, you don't have a pulse! 100/5    3. Orange County Girl- Your average hip-hop song. i don't like it much right now, but it will grow on me. i think this should be her next single. 3/5    4. Early Winter- kind of has the same flavor as \\"cool\\" 4/5    5. Now That You Got It-2/5    6. 4 In The Morning- 5/5    7. Yummy- great song. it contains drumming with almost no background music. it also features pharell, so i automatically assumed it was a good song. it wasn't as good as i thought it would be. still, it could be the next \\"fergalicious\\" 4/5    8. Fluorescent- when i first herad this song, it got stuck in my head. later, i couldn't remember where i had heard this song. i knew it was by gwen stefani, but i couldn't remember which album it was on. when i finally listened to this album again, i heard this song again and was like \\"Ohhh! THAT'S where i've heard this song before\\"5/5    9. Breakin Up- 3/5    10. Don't Get It Twisted- 3/5    11. U Started It- 4/5    12. Wonderful Life- this song would do well as a single. i like it a lot. 5/5    Gwen Stefani is the new Britney Spears. well, at least the way that britney SHOULD be. after getting married and having children, she divorced kevin. soon, she started partying with paris hilton. then, kevin told \\"us weekly\\" that she was a lesbian, but we can tell that that's total bullcrap. then, he threatened to take the kids away. she tried to do all she could to keep the kids and she ended up bald. but even though she is bald, i think that timblalnd and justin timberlake are trying to save her career, but i'm not sure that that's going to work. but if it does, her album should be worth buying. but if she doesn't come back to the way she was, i'm destroying all my cds of her (except for the \\"now that's what i call music\\" cds).     On the other hand, gwen stefani is awesome. she was one of the good artists that i had long awaited for a comeback album. other artists include christina aguilera, beyonce, nelly furtado, avril lavigne, and ciara. the artists that i am still waiting on are mariah carey, kelly clarkson, and usher.
B00023B1LC|1.0|The movie is a piece of art. One of my all time favorites. The Extended edition DVD is very badly compiled. The Bonus features are sub par with bad video quality. The alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film, and do not have the BI look and feel. Other special features are small and without much substance. The extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended. It is not a director's cut (the DVD states this upfront in the opening credits) so it not fun to watch. Don't get this if you are looking for a LOTR style extended edition.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|This film was one that I had heard a lot about. It played at Sundance. It was playing the independent theater circuit. I had wanted to see it for months and had not been able to get around to it. Finally, I had the opportunity to see it at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. My expectations were high because of the months of anticipation, but leaving the theater I found every one of them fulfilled. Ryan Gosling's performance was one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen. The supporting cast matched him step for step. The story was not easy to digest, so those not willing to see conflict among characters without clear, defined, movie-ending resolution should skip it. Those who are interested in an original idea, executed to near perfection, that will keep you thinking about its ideas, characters, and scenes for months after: you will not be disappointed. I bought it the week it came out on dvd.
