0765325950|1.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. Brandon Sanderson just wasn't a good choice to replace Robert Jordan.  Robert Jordan went overboard on his attention to minutiae, but Brandon Sanderson is even worse on the opposite end of the scale.  No disrespect to Jordan's widow, but I could wish that she had selected an author who more closely emulated her husband's writing style.  Overwhelming detail would be preferable to Sanderson's one-dimensional characters and story-telling, especially in this final installment.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading Fall of Giants and was completely engaged with all of the diverse characters.  It was painful every time I had to put it down to do something else, be it eating, sleeping or talking with someone else.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Liked the movie and thought it was good. Didn't have enough background personally to completely understand everything and did appreciate some of that being explained.
B0085A9J18|5.0|These fights were some of the rawest since ONG BAK. Rip roaring fun, incredible action, won an award for some film festival. WOW!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Solid movie to rent, wouldn't have been pleased paying $50 for the fam to see it. It has some good acting but is predictable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ana and Christian are an amazing couple who go though many trials and come out swinging. These books are fantastic if you say otherwise then your not following the story but merely the words. Learn what it really means to read. Sincerely someone who's been reading at a college reading level since 5th grade.
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|A little B movie like in it's presentation. Very much a copy of the Bourne movie series but not nearly as good cinematography !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint.  Downton at its finest. Please support your local PBS stations so they may continue to bring quality entertainment.  Love that I could watch it online via Amazon Prime.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best book I've read in a while. Kept me on the edge of my seat and couldn't put it down.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|this book is an important book for all  of us to read to heighten our universal awareness of human rights.
B00821OX98|5.0|It's a very good tv show,full of action and drama that keeps u on u feet.making u want to know what will go down next episode.i think anyone who likes a sci-fi action show that has good drama in it should check it out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so wonderful and fun to play. It really makes you think and work through a series of  clues. I have already recommended it to my friends.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Did you ever read a book so fast and yet wanted it to never end? That is how I feel about the last installment of this trilogy. As with the other two, this was so fast paced and written so well that the story played like a movie in my head. It's a shame the author died because I really want to know the sisters story. Also at some point in book two, there are supposedly two other siblings. I want all their stories.<br /><br />I loved this trilogy and would recommend it.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I love this movie and I bought it with it having no scratches. I can't stop watching it and I love it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really challenges your thinking processes. Most of the necessary moves are logical. but not all of them! It will be worth a couple of bucks when more floors come out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day writes very well...this series is a page turner. I personally couldn't put it down. The only con was having to wait so long for the release date. great read
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice Challenge. No Need To Look  Up Answers. Only TeP Levpels So Far. If There Were More<br />Levels I Would Give A Higher Start Rating.
076790592X|5.0|I picked up Tuesdays with Morrie because it was a required reading for my aging and long-term care class. I went into it thinking that the book would be a quick, interesting read. Instead, I found this little book, about a brave man's battle with ALS as he faced down death, to be one of the most inspiring life story that I have ever read.<br /><br />In this moving story, I came to a new appreciation of what is truly important for a happy life: family, friends, and buildings healthy, loving relationships. Looking at the world through Morrie's eyes, seeing this dying man savor and appreciate every aspect of made me stop and reflect on the values of living.<br /><br />This book re-evaluates the meaning of success and an opportunity to reflect on the simple, fundamentals of moving forward though life with joy, appreciating the years granted to us, not fearing growing older. As Morrie so poigniantly stated, \\"fear of aging is an example of a life not fully lived.\\" This was a truly moving story and in my mind's eye I can picture Morrie on the dance floor, head back, arms flung open and wide, embracing the music of a life well lived.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This book helped explain the meaning and purpose behind meditating.  The overall message is to slow down and enjoy the life you live.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|grandchildren love it. they seem to want to play it all the time. keeps them busy. great game for them.
B007G51UV0|4.0|This is a pretty good motherboard, I bought it to build a mid to high-end gaming computer and it did the job pretty well except...  First of all I had quite a few problems actually getting the build running due to a few errors that weren't very clear.  After some research it turns out the memory I bought wasn't compatible, but that was after taking it out and re-installing it into the case giving me 3 different errors in the process.  I used some older memory but it did job, at the cost of 10GB due to the incompatibility.  That wasn't my biggest issue though.  The biggest issue I had was the top PCI-E port either not responding or being dead out of the box.  I was planning on running a 2-way SLI with two EVGA GTX 670's, but after trying to install just one at a time, the top PCI-E slot would not recognize that something was installed into it.  The older 670 I had would turn on but the fan would immediately start spinning at full speed and the mobo would still not recognize it being there.  The bottom slot had the same problem but the center slot worked.  After getting just one installed, I tried working with two but since the top slot still had problems with it, I could not get two 670's running at once and I now have one of them just lying on my desk.  I don't know if the slot was DOA or if it was my fault, but I'm not going to bash this motherboard for just that.  Besides those two problems, it's a fantastic motherboard.  The BIOS is clean and easy to use, offering both a simple and advanced view for those with different needs.  I've been using it for the past month or so with no problems besides those listed previously and if it weren't for the two problems I currently have, I would keep it.  However, I'm still going to end up replacing it with a different model/brand due to the memory incompatibility.  Still a fantastic motherboard and I would recommend it to people, just make sure the RAM you plan on using is compatible with this motherboard before-hand.<br /><br />Memory: Corsair Vengeance 16GB(2x8GB) DDR3 1600MHz(PC3 12800) CMZ16GX3M2A1600C10
B00BWLKTOS|2.0|There are only two numbers on this CD that were new to me that I enjoyed. The rest were either limited in style or musical range and didn't have the flair that their other work has shown. What I really did not like, was that there were four (!) numbers that have been recorded on previous CD's. &#34;New&#34; to me means all new music, all new material to enjoy, not a repeat from previous CD's. I would skip buying this one unless you have not collected any of their other recordings.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well-written and interest holding!  Loved the book and will be recommending it to my book club. Books like this go a long way in helping us understand cultural differences.
B008ROG1QI|4.0|Although this strays from the true story, it is close.  Full of action, true detail of the men who crewed the Memphis Belle, and their history went through.  It is a moving rendition of what a famous flight crew and many others went through during the early stages of WWII.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I really liked this the first time seeing it.  Then, for some reason, I just keep going back and watching it again and again....especially after a long tiring day!
B002FQOI0A|4.0|An all around good  book<br />I had to have my mom explain some parts of it and after she did,  it all made sense
B000SW2F80|2.0|This is for the Blu Ray. 5 stars for the movie. Subtract stars for lack of special features and jumpy video. The image seems to \\"vibrate\\" especially on a large TV. It's 2013, can't they stabilize these images? My eyes hurt.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Having tons of fun playing this.  Also check out World of Goo.  Love these guys! You will enjoy this puzzle game.
B00B6QXN56|4.0|This is my first Bonamassa cd.  I liked that it has a feel of old time and new times blues.  The acoustics are captured on this cd and a joy to listen to.  The competency and interpretation of the players are superb.  I will be looking into other cds by Bonamassa.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is a must have for Imagine Dragons fans - well done and a wonderful addition to any one's music collection.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is a lot like Candy Crush to me but without the frustration of limited lives.  You can even play the game in a 'zen' mode so you don't have to worry about a timer ticking down.  The game helps you out by starting with easier puzzles that get progressively trickier. I appreciated the game makers taking my learning curve into consideration!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great new release from a fantastic artist.  There is so much to like about this album - there is something for everyone!
0765322889|5.0|Yeah this book is hard to understand at first and may infuriate many readers. I was initially dumbfounded by the warrens and the multitude of characters. But something happened, around the half way mark I began piecing events together and then pretty soon I wasn't checking the character list as much. I wholeheartedly believe that this book is all the more rewarding because everything isn't handed to you on a silver platter. My advice is to just stick with it because the fights and imagery in this book are like nothing I've ever experienced. Characters are shattering mountains and wiping out entire armies, so when said characters clash on the battlefield it gives new meaning to the word epic. This book is unique because it has political intrigue much like Game of Thrones, while also magic and god-based action that makes characters like Gandalf look like little boys. Gardens of the Moon is the best fantasy book I have ever read (and I've read ASoFaI as well as the First Law Trilogy) and a completely unique reading experience.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I loved it and am looking forward to the newest season. Jax is a beast !  Best show on cable tv
B00D2K40WY|1.0|This app is not good at all because when I opened it up, I saw this box pop up that said that u really didn't have the app unless u buy it.<br /><br />WHAT A RIP OFF !!!!!!!!!  Don't buy this app !!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging game, but not so challenging that I get frustrated and have to quit.  Also, no problems with the app's functionality, so far.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|By far the most beautiful Ghoulia ever! Her eyes are captivating and her hair is soft and thick. Cleo is exceptionally detailed as well. Her soft raven black hair has teal streaks and a pop of purple in the bangs and looks nothing short of royal in her mummy inspired dress and lab jacket. The mad science accessories make for extra fun play and display. An absolute must for any collection!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I started reading this series so I could talk about it with my granddaughter. I have enjoyed them and look forward to the next book.
B000000OU0|5.0|This is the third time I have bought this same album. Each time I buy it, it mysteriously disappears (a.k.a. stolen). I can't live without this one.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Reading so I can communicate with her on a subject she enjoys I have enjoyed also. Good series to read for any age.
B004KAWC0C|3.0|I was hoping the movie would describe better the history in that period of Argentina, but it was fair and was more a movie about Eva Peron.  I enjoyed it though.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Even if you don't think it looks that interesting, give it a chance. You'll enjoy the journey (and/or be appalled by what you learn). Josh Fox's film making is very good.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham!!<br />Well done, couldn't put the book down!<br />Can not wait to read the sequel!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like that I could take care of a horse with out all the real work, and I could win shows by pushing a button.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|loved it! Inside musicians world a bit. Grohl seems like a guy that can fit in with anybody and proves it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Thanku for help i need from kindle fire HD ok i know it's hard do new things with my kindle
0307887448|5.0|I rarely read a book that I cannot put down. Last time I remember it was Ender's game that gives me sleepless night to read a book.<br />But this book is so awesome I lose another night.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't mention any of Nintendo / Sega consoles. And also \\"Raiden\\" was so popular back then it should have mentioned.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I like this dictionary. It's useful because I use it for school and other extra-curricular  activities.I will share this book with other in the future.
030789701X|1.0|I got the wrong book,I paid for the 1200 page version! This one has half that I WANT MY BOOK
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I am constantly upgrading my PC to handle the latest games and my work which can be hard on the hardware at times. Liquid cooling was my first choice but they were too expensive for my likes. I decided on this knowing that my case is big enough (i use a thermaltake gaming case). The instructions that came with it and are no help which is why I rated it 4 stars but everything else is top notch. My temperatures have gone down significantly. Previously, my CPU temp. would be 48-52 when I was browsing and listening to music but know it doesn't cross 55-60 when i'm gaming at high settings. It's quiet but the only thing that bugged me was having to take off the motherboard from the casing to put this on it. Otherwise, this is a great product for hardcore gamers.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|great continuation of the story... left me wanting more More MORE!!! the next book can't come soon enough for me!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|intricate, campy, emotional... love it.  in many ways the best season of Dr. Who.  start here and prepare to become infatuated.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is a great family movie, teaching great values.  The colors and visual effects were a joy to watch, and exellent music!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a hard book to start but easy to finish. You just cry off and on from about chapter 15 onward.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|What an amazing movie such a complex topic delivered in understandable and riveting form.  My daughter who usually falls asleep during movies was spellbound.  Great visual effects!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Thought I wouldn't like it but I actually did.  A little harder than I expected but fun all the same.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I laughed out loud several times and smiled through pretty much the whole thing. How can you not, when Malkovich teams up with Willis and Mary Louise Parker is doing her ditzy thing? Helen Mirren and massive ammunition, perfect together. I had to ask myself at one point, what is the plot? But who cares. It's totally smart assed with lots of explosions and gags. I'm sure Red 2 will be the same.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Having seen LOTR there was some good foreshadowing but it wasn't crucial to the plot. The bar was set pretty high with LOTR and this movie just wasn't as epic but still worth seeing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I seriously couldn't put these books down once I started reading them. I will admit that sometimes the author was kind of slow getting to the point, and very detail oriented, however, it did build up the suspense and force me to keep going to find out what happened. The story line was extremely unique, I loved every minute of the series.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|A decent show, Lots of Witch Kicking. An interesting twist on an old fairytale. And the Ladies are hot for witches.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I left my husband at home and saw this movie with a fellow Trekkie--my 28 year-old son.  We both enjoyed the film immensely so I decided to give it to him as a birthday gift and know that he will watch it now and then with buddies.  This was a nice addition to the rest of his Star Trek film collection.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is not not your normal traditional western.<br />Quentin does not care about precise definitions of good guys and bad guys.<br />He really doesn't believe they exist.<br /> The biggest revelation from the maestro is that people when dealing with complicated problems tend to simplify by looking for stereotypes instead of trying to sort out the facts.<br /> The racism issue is present through most of the film but the most violent scenes involve hatred between whites or blacks.<br /> The director makes a strong point when most of the conflicts in the the story are motivated by by the struggle for power and the color of the skin is either incidental or a mere excuse.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|The slimport works as advertised. It's truly plug and play and I enjoy being able to view video from my nexus 4 phone on my 55&#34; LCDTV!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome. There is one annoying thing about this game. The dragons are expensive in both the game and life. I. do recommend this game to everyone!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Well written and suspenseful but not as good as Dark Places or Gone Girl. A little bit contrived plot wise. That said, it's still a good read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sad changes to the cast but this show is really great. I can't watch only one episode at a time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome book...good read! Just finished book two, looking forward to book three.<br /><br />I will definitely spread the word about this trilogy.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I don't like this game, it is confusing and I can't find any directions.  What are the gold crown points for if you can't buy anything with them???
B007PVHAN2|5.0|I have been a fan of Bob Marley's since I was old enough to enjoy music. My wife and I truly enjoyed watching this documentary on Bob Marley's life. I learned a lot more about him, his music and his mission in life. This documentary was very informative and inspirational. I give it a double 5 stars!!!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Loved the character development and the introduction of Talon and the Court. Can't wait to read the next novel in the series.
B00CATSONE|5.0|...and finding out about him, will ASTOUND you.  It should be HE that is thought of as the father of science, instead of Edison or others...speaking of which, wait til you read about what a swine Edison was!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined With You continues the drama and romance of Eva and Gideon. Sylvia Day tantalizes us with just the right amount of suspense and sizzling sex that her fans will not be able to put this book down. This is definitely not your mother's &#34;Harlequin&#34; read. Get ready for yet another fictional man who has it all - monogamy, money, gorgeous looks, and a PhD in lovemaking!
0671042858|1.0|I was absolutely SHOCKED at what a let-down this book was. As other reviewers mentioned, I kept waiting for the book to start, only to realize that the entire story is literally just a girl surviving in the forest. This lesser version of \\"Into the Wild\\" (by Krakauer) seemed only to detail a 9 year old girl (too clever for a girl her age) and her efforts to survive in the wild. It is almost as if King described to his journal how he would get on in the woods of New England, and then later - in order to publish this as a \\"horror/suspense\\" novel - replaced himself with little Trisha and threw in some hallucination of a monster that served as a wholly unsuccessful attempt to build suspense as the little girl navigated her way out of the woods. While King's words paint a convincing picture that will help you understand what it is to be lost in the woods, this book will make you feel as though you are lost in a narrative that ultimately goes nowhere.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I, like everyone else, couldn't wait for this book! It surprised me, love Sylvia Day, love all of the Crossfire series.

B003UBTX72|5.0|I saw the Rolling Stones in concert for the first time in 2013.  I dearly loved the concert and later purchased and read the book.  The book is incredibly interesting and took me back to a point in time when rock and roll wasn't considered mainstream music.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Keith Richards love of music and his lifelong obsessive devotion to the acoustic guitar. This book inspired me to revisit music and artists that ive not listened to in many years.  My all time favorite Stones songs (Before They Make Me Run and Gimme Shelter) resonate on a completely different level after reading this book.  I highly recommend this book.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|If you're the type of opera fan who rejects an opera as bad based on liberties taken with the setting then this production isn't for you.<br /><br />If, however, you're the type of person who values the quality of the music and the main requirement you have of the setting is that it not distract you with odd incongruities when you're watching the performance then I think you'll enjoy this. I've seen productions of Don Giovanni set in modern times, for example, that still kept the sword fighting. That's distracting to me. If an opera is set in a time where the gender norms are so wildly different that the story doesn't make sense, then that's distracting.<br /><br />But the updated setting here of 1960's Las Vegas (and the characters mapping to members of the rat pack) is very clever. Because the 60's were so culturally riotous it doesn't distract to have a lecherous duke along-side a religious (and maybe naive) Gilda.<br /><br />I think I still would prefer to see these performers in a more traditional staging, but I can appreciate this production for its cleverness and I thoroughly enjoy it for the talent of the performers.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thank you Mr. Jordan (RIP) and Mr. Sanderson for a great end to an incredible journey.  Or is it?<br />Don
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter loves it ,and she plays non stop. We are both adicked to it and I love how it's so r realistic :) it's awesome
B002PXFMUI|5.0|I last heard this album on 8 track back in 1978-79 somewhere in there and it was great headphones music, listened to it all the time. This digital re-master of TEE sounds as if it were recorded yesterday. Took me right back to that time and place when I first heard it, awesome! Kraftwerk was the band that paved the way for every other electronic band to come, way ahead of their time no joke. If you know this album, I recommend this purchase. If you have not heard this, get a set of head phones and enjoy the hypnotic pace oft this groundbreaking album.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|There used to be a sort of unspoken agreement in Hollywood not to depict harm to children.  There is enough of that in real life. I don't need to see it in a movie.  Without giving any spoilers I found the ending very disturbing.<br />If you don't have kids it probably won't bother you the way it bothered my wife and I.<br />I like Guillermo's movies and I would have liked this except for my above comments.
0062197266|3.0|This book was okay but not that memorable.  Character could have been developed better beyond her OCD. Some interesting parts but I had no trouble putting it down between reads.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great on everything! Cell phone, tablet. Very nice to be mobile and read when you want and pick right up where you left off.
030758836X|4.0|Loved the book until the end. I had I thought about all the wonderful ways the story could end, but I was actually mad when I came to the last page. If not for the ending I would have given it 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Can you escape is fun to play and it is very addictive to play. I just sit and play all day long.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Honestly I stopped watching after the first half. Then I watched the rest on HBO and really enjoyed this movie. But this movie did not stream cleanly from amazon when I was watching online.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|I love the Beach Boys......the harmonies especially....great recordings on this album......so happy I bought this one for the summer and the summer's to come.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|With this show! Episode 8 had the best ending ever and I can't wait to see what next season will bring!

1781162646|5.0|This was a great story about a young man just starting out in life.  It brought back memories of when I was that age.  The mystery was also great.  It was suspenful right up to the last part of the story.  I could not put it down!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great game,love it...gives me sumpin to dew after werk...I'm an old man an werkin on that two minutes is sumpin to dew....I'll git it eventually...keep up da good werk....love ya..
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I didn't have great expectations for this movie.  I thought it would be so-so.  I was pleasantly surprised when we watched it as a family last week.  It is funny and sweet with a nice mix of mischief.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. If you want to change your life - read it
B009I2UH2W|5.0|perfect gift for iPhone 5 user. Nicer than many would buy for themselves. Quality feel and finish. Low profile to lighter helps it stay out of the way. Cord is not very long even when extended but this is for a car so how long do you want it? When retracted, it takes up very little room. Light lets you know you've made a solid connection.
B00B18XI0O|5.0|The main plot is a butler who looks back at his three decades of service and questions himself.  Did he serve the right man?  Did he do the right thing in serving a great man?  Did he miss the love of his life?  Did he make the right choices?<br />But there is also a theme buried deep within the pages of the book.  A theme about seasons.  When it is time to work, when it is time to retire, to enjoy the Fall of one's life?  It is a portrait of a man in his late years in a England which is in its late years also.  Postwar England is the setting perfect for this story.<br />He seems to have a wonderful grasp of the times, the thoughts, and the feel of England and those who serve.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a great series, Downton Abbey is.  I love the story line and the cast is really terrific.  The setting is beautiful and there is just enough humor to balance the serious topics.  Maggie Smith is priceless in the role of the dowager.  So sad that Sybill and Matthew died, but I'm sure they will come up with some good story line.  I love the way the servants and the family get along and care so much for each other.  I love Anna and Bates, what an adorable couple.
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|I've seen all the Die Hard movies and this is my least favorite.  Sometimes they need to just let the story end...........on a good note.  Booo!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This is the Ultimate collection of Start Trek: The Original Series. Ordered by \\"Official\\" air date, meaning, \\"The Cage\\" (the original and later scrapped pilot is not included). It is revived however in the 2 part episode \\"The Menagerie\\". Lots of bonuses and it contains 2 versions of each episode. the originals with original sound and special effects and the new enhanced versions with updated sound and special effects much like The Next Generation type effects but not overdone. As a fan who watched the original series with my dad on an old black and white TV I actually prefer the enhanced versions. They are breathtaking. I really think it is the way Gene Roddenberry would have wanted it.<br /><br />I have only one small nit-pick. You can only choose 2 sound options, original mono or enhanced 7.1 DTS surround so my lonely 5.1 surround system gives me weird issues like sudden quiet dialog or blazing loud music at sporadic moments. Probably signals it cannot handle. I have to use my Blu-Ray players built in encoder to re-encode it to Dolby 5.1 and still there are some weird things that happen. Mono is fine though but the enhanced sound is preferred.<br /><br />Have all the DVDs? Big Star Trek Fan? Sell the DVDs and buy these. Then look for the other new releases of the following movies and series with the new enhancements. You will NOT be disappointed.
0783240287|5.0|This is one of our favorite musical.  We got this copy for our nephew. Our grand daughter loves it.  Great for all ages.
B005VQE2LQ|5.0|I simply do not understand the negativity this movie got. I have been a Green Lantern fan as long as I could read comics and own every single issue, most older collections digitally from the DC Comics store.<br /><br />This begins with the Hal Jordan story and is fairly to the letter considering they put it in todays time period. If they went by canon then they would have to set it in the 50's with his first appearance in Showcase #22 (October 1959).<br /><br />Drop all that and get into today and make Green Lantern what he really is, the heart of courage and will of the human race fighting for our little part of the universe.<br /><br />This movie delivers that and more.
B008602KQI|4.0|I read all three books before seeing this movie. I loved the books. This movie kept me interested but definitely not as good as the book. I think I was mostly interested in how they would translate what happened in the book onto the screen. It's worth seeing the movie, but for the full emotional impact, read the book.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I thought this was going to be a weird movie that was just distasteful.  Then I was invited to watch Despicable Me 2 at the theater.  I went with my kids and really enjoyed the movie!  I was shocked.  I decided I needed to go home and find Despicable Me on Amazon and watch it to better understand the part 2!  To my surprise, I enjoyed it even better.  The director of this movie did a great job of making you like a villain.  When does that ever happen?  This is a great movie to enjoy with the whole family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was not sure i was interested in reading a book about this topic, it sounded like such a downer to me, but this book touches on every emotion. I recommend it highly. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very challenging and exciting game. Keeps you thinking challenges your memory powers. The story line is very gripping too keeps you on the edge. You just want to keep playing so you can see how it's going to end
B006MW3UZW|5.0|fascinating story . . . normally the aristocratic lifestyle would not appeal to me but my husband and i could not get enough of it. great character development! we're hooked:)
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Lots of action! Jack Reacher is a great character and Tom Cruise does a great job. He really brings the character and story to life.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a good app I've had problems. It is a good app for tweens and littler kids. I was looking at the other reviews and one said that it crashes but I disagree because I have had the game for a while and it has never crashed.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This score presents enough of the entire show to allow even those who have not yet sat in a WICKED audience to take in the deeply moving wisdom from Stephen Schwartz. The very favorite show of the honorary daughter of my heart, WICKED speaks (and sings) repeatedly of following your own heartfelt wisdom, ignoring detractors when you already are accomplishing the thing they say is impossible, learning the lessons offered from The Universe through the people She puts in your life and knowing there is good inside even apparent wickedness.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a timeless tale of a young man who faces adversity at every corner. Most of us find it easy to identify with it's masterfully written main character Kvothe. He is so endearing that you will most likely find yourself losing sleep from worry as you progress through the chapters. This is truly a book you won't want to put down.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss engages your full attention from page one and does not release it until the very end. Luckily, part two of this series is available, or many of us would run mad for lack of more to this story.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book highly recommend it keep my on the edge the whole time kind of relevant to todays world enjoy
B008W14ZD2|5.0|How can it be bad?  I love owl city.  And this is so cheap!  The digital booklet has all the lyrics in it.
1469240580|5.0|I have read this book now three time over the past thirty years.  Was very happy to find it on Amazon in audio form as my eyesight is getting weak.  Thank you.  Respectfully,  R. Mennes
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I thought ' the wizard of Oz' was a lot better. Long movie and then it incorporated scenes of old movie. I liked the coreography.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Its a very good game. Its a good mind game to kept your mind working. Keeps you thinking.We like this type games
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game. It gets the mind working and helps relax when stressed. I definitely recommend this to anyone.
1416550534|5.0|I've read several books by this author, and find her superb.  The core of each mystery is buried within the folds of generations.  In the present time, the heroine discovers a family mystery that she is determined to resolve.  The telling spans several generations, and every step takes one back in time as the plot evolves.<br />This book, like &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; and &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34; is a gift to the reader, wrapped in multiple layers of delicate tissue paper.  As each layer is carefully removed, the reader becomes more enmeshed in the story and the characters involved.  When you finally reach that deep family secret at the core of the story, you discover that the inclination to second-guess the writer during the unfolding story was in vain.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but only 10 levels. Needs to have more to be better. Worth playing once but would not be a replay game.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like knowing what percentage of my battery is left.  It's nice to find these apps that help me keep up with the charge as needed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an awesome and I would read it over and over again can't wait for the third book hurry please
B006ZVCQNM|4.0|I bought this deluxe edition because I heard quite a few people saying that this is a great remaster by Andy Pearce but it really isn't any thing special, at least to my ears!!! In tracks 4-6 it does sound like those three have a little bit better treble and the drums have a little more snap when you compare it to the first non-remastered issue but all the other tracks sound about the same as the first issue!!!! I think that they have actually dialed back the volume slightly from the first issue. You actually have to turn the volume knob a few points higher than you have to with the first original issue. I don't like my music in remasters to be compressed to the max but I shouldn't have to turn the volume knob that high with a remaster. A little compression wouldn't hurt, just not too much. I even think that the original issue was mastered a little bit better, fuller, and louder in the song \\"We Rock\\" than this Andy Pearce offering!!!!! If they would have remastered this like they did most of the Jethro Tull cds this would have been a great success, but not so on this!!!!!<br /><br />As far as the musical content this is Dio's finest effort (don't believe the 3 trolls who gave this 1 star) and is a little bit better than HOLY DIVER and LOCK UP THE WOLVES albums. I really wouldn't recommend you buy this just to get a better recording of the original content but the second disc could be a reason to give this deluxe version a try. NOT A BIG FAN OF ANDY PEARCE UNLESS HE LEARNS THE ART OF REMASTERING IN QUICK FASHION!!!! I'm out!!!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great for tracking weather for multiple cities for travel planning and packing. Really helped for an 11 day cruise with 7 ports.
1400052181|5.0|My daughter's school, Whittier College, required this for summer reading. Since I ordered it off Amazon early, I thought I'd read it before giving it to her to read. I knew nothing about HeLA or this story and was impressed with how this book was well-written and well-researched and best of all was written from the heart. I think this should be required reading for anyone entering any portion of the medical field and I commend Whittier College for requiring it for summer reading. I can totally see how students will be able to discuss and debate the many issues that surface in this book.<br /><br />Kudos to the author!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like it because I can play the game on the go.  The game sometimes freezes up, but most of the time the app works ok.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Like many people, I really wanted to enjoy Argo. In fact, on first viewing, I did enjoy it... although only moderately. The problem with Argo is whether or not we should judge it as entertainment or history, fact or fiction.<br /><br />If you fall into the 'entertainment' camp, then Argo is just another political thriller... and a mediocre one at that. The fictional story is only moderately paced, extremely predictable, and packed to the limit with clichés. You will enjoy yourself for a couple hours then go about your life. You won't feel cheated but you also won't have any real reason to ever see the movie again.<br /><br />The big problem (for me at least) is for those people who are hoping to get a little history out of their entertainment. And in that aspect, Argo is a total failure, a true crime. The cardinal sin of historical fiction (imo) is when you literally change the hero of a story into a villain. The biggest offender of recent years that I can recall is the movie Big Miracle (about saving the whales in Alaska, starring Drew Barrymore, sp). I have lived in Alaska for almost four decades and was here during the REAL event of the whales being trapped. It made front page news and caught the publics' heart strings. In the REAL world, the whales were saved by the charity of an oil services company named VECO. In the movie, however, the story told the EXACT OPPOSITE; the villain of the film was an oil company - literally a lie. Of course, we all understand why this blatant lie was told. It fits the narrative of certain political factions which essentially control the film industry. Don't get me wrong, the point of telling you this is not to slam the movie business. They have the right to produce any story they wish. They are not historians, they are entertainers. However, anyone who wishes to get history from Argo should ignore the picture completely. Argo is guilty of the cardinal sin; it turns the extremely heroic actions of both British and New Zealand citizens (who bravely supported and hid the Americans) into cowardly appeasement. Would you risk torture and hanging to help people from another country, knowing that if you are caught your family could also be tortured and killed? We should be celebrating people who do something so truly heroic... NOT turning them into villains.<br /><br />Argo is mediocre as entertainment but worth a rent on movie night when there is nothing else to do. As history, however, it is disgraceful and, I would go so far as to say, perhaps even evil.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The challenge grows very gradually.  Level 10 seemed a little easy. I hope the challenge goes up again. I have enjoyed it to level 10 and want to get to level 11 now. That should tell you something.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The Hollywood take on the passage of the 13th Amendment includes some rumors and legends, but mostly keeps to the facts.  The movie illustrates the struggles and politics involved with passing the 13th Amendment well.  Just remember not all the tangential stories are based on actual fact but more rumors and legends. At least there is no love interest for Lincoln's son.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|It was to painful to continue after the first 10 minutes. I like fantasy and science fiction but could not stand anymore of it.  It was dumbed up and could not figure out if it wanted to be a comedy or a real story.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|enjoyed seeing the 1920's lifestyle of the rich and top shelf acting but story is bizarre.  Seems most lines were directly from book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Loving it. An excellent mix of &quot;take care of the animal&quot; and arcade style game. Simple in concept, but can be very challenging.
B007J2TMQ0|4.0|I found this a compelling read and would recommend it to others who, like me, are not well versed in World War II. It presents the broad contours of the war in accessible terms, giving some measure also of the 'human cost' without degenerating into war porn.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained that the treatment of the Pacific War is cursory and that the American contribution to the overall Allied effort is made light of. There are certainly passages which support this. Yet some American generals (eg Patton) emerge from this account as titans, while their peers from other countries (eg Montgomery) suffer without respite.<br /><br />I find it harder to acquit Beevor of bias in relation to his treatment of the German leadership. The idea that Hitler lost the war single-handedly comes through all too strongly. German generals emerge from Beevor's account - almost to a man - as having impeccable martial virtue and prowess. The account would have been richer with a more nuanced view, even if the conclusion is bound to survive.<br /><br />Finally, I was a little disappointed by the account of the air and naval wars. They may not have been as significant as the land war, but I suspect also that Beevor's heart was not in the task of relating them.
160774273X|5.0|We cannot get Organic Artisan Bread here.  So making our own is the only way.  This book breaks down each step and makes it not only easy but fun.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Waiting for the third season ,,but it was expinceve ,,so I start googling and found some where free to watch and I finish the third season ,,love it good story,,
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|One of the best albums I have heard. Amon Amarth just keep getting better and better. Keep them coming guys!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie became one of my favorite movies of all time and Its a great movie to watch with your family I got my parents to like it too and they don't really Like animated movies.<br />Oh and Steve Carell is Funny!!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's not just a match three, you also get to rebuilt and help the people.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Omg, I saw my friend play this on her Dsi and iPad and it looks apropos fun!!! I can't wait!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I couldn't put it down! For all those that are skeptical...just give it a try.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love the book because It helped me spell out words and helped me mini times when I need help with language arts home work thank you for having the new Oxford American dictionary and if you can send me more
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|I love everything about this album. It feel sort of like a return to some of the older stuff, but with more creative guitar parts than they have had on some of their recent work. 10,000 tons of metal on this record.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Although had at certain times really hard still fun<br /><br />FUN game to play and I have no more to say cause  really I just want to play by I have to right a review to continue playing the game.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I was impressed at how this book brought to life a particular time in the south, and brought home the realities of slavery in the context of a specific set of characters. It was a good novel that kept me interested in the characters every step of the way.
B008M721MS|4.0|I absolutely love skype! I did have it n my computer but i couldnt carry that around and so i got this on my kindle and i absolutely love and enjoy it
B0083Z614S|5.0|In the current days of computers and mobile devices, it is refreshing to remember a time when the splendors of nature were entrancing. It makes me want to spend time in my own yard with a shovel and trowel.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|What can you add to the accolades given years ago to a great book? I ordered The Sun Also Rises as I was beginning my second week of a 3-week stay in Spain, and I read it nightly, finally finishing after returning home (like Papa's characters, we consumed an ample supply of Spain's beverage selections and often bedded down very late, much too late to read and remember). The book served me well as I toured the bullrings and tapas bars of Andalucia, imagining myself accompanied as Jake with Lady Brett. To continue, I should now read Death in the Afternoon. Ole!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|An incredibly fun movie with great visuals - I can't believe I missed this in theaters!  Its very much like the comic book, so if you're a Judge Dredd fan definitely watch this.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|This was my first purchase of a Mumford & Sons product.  Good choice. They have a great sound and lyrics that go deeper than much of today's music.
081297381X|1.0|i couldn't hurdle his raging ego and found the reading pretty obnoxious.  i quit the book after 20 or so pages.  i wish i could find the receipt so that i can return it, will probably just exchange it at a used book store.<br /><br />he makes a big deal from what seems a pedestrian observation, almost a tautology: unpredictable catastrophes have disproportionate impacts on history.  duh.  then he spends an inordinate amount of time patting himself on the back for this profound revelation.<br /><br />perhaps a more specific point he attempts is that the bell curve (gaussian distribution) doesn't work.  but again, duh.  the gaussian distribution is just a first order approximation when (near) equilibrium is assumed.  the error is in the application and overuse, not the theory.<br /><br />you'd be better of reading Asimov's Foundation series.  much more entertaining and informative wrt to the topic of \\"black swan events\\", Asimov's event is called the mule. And then he ties it together with the robots.  Asimov is america's Tolkien, not grrm.  but now i've rambled away.<br /><br />if you are looking for something more... nonfiction, try \\"The Physics of Wall Street\\" J.O. Weatherall.  it's less of a tirade; informative and well written.<br /><br />overall, came away with the impression that this guys is a self impressed deuche bag.<br /><br />and what is the made up field that he is a chair of? risk engineering? talk about platonizing.
0374214913|5.0|LOVED this book! Great characters...intriguing plot. Easy to get into and kept my interest all the way through. I recommend it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is the greatest, I spend a couple of hours each night relaxing, playing Spider while my husband watches TV.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I was offered this on Kindle when I was stuck in an airport for a couple of hours, so I started playing. I had no idea what I was doing but kept playing for 2 hours. Then I got up, bought a book of Sudoku puzzles, and used my brain. That was a much better experience.<br /><br /> I know that some video games do make you think--I play Brain Games on Lumosity every morning--but this is a waste.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Quentin serves up another gem. Like him personally or not, this director has a style that is part spoof and part genius story telling. You can watch this film on a couple of levels -- one of which is the Peckinpaugh (sp?) tribute that is going on.<br /><br />Beautifully acted and brilliantly directed, just make sure you have the stomach for the n words and some ungodly number of killings.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This is one of the great horror comedies of all time! Bruce Campbell reprises his classic Evil Dead roll of Ash, who is now thrown into an alternate past filled with nasties, armed with his chainsaw hand and his trusty boomstick. He hilariously plays both good and bad versions of himself, locked in a battle to the death for the Necronomicon. It's good vs evil, the living vs the dead, take no prisoners!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I thought that it would be different than it is. I don't really need it. It's more for people who don't have a life and can only connect fith others electronically.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book. Loved it. I really really really really, want to read another one when it comes out. I am really hoping!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|My granddaughter and I really enjoy playing this game together. It is good family fun and very entertaining and adventurous!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The story of Lena and Ethan continues with even more surprise s. Great series. Looking forward to the other two books!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|challenging but not too hard - even for the experienced match 3 fanatic.  I love most all itree games if I see their name on an app I guarantee it will be fun.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Intelligently written, combined with excellent actors and director navigation, I rate this series(so far) right up there with &#34;Crossing Jordan&#34; and &#34;Bones&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It would be best for a younger kid, but it's pretty easy and I finished the whole thing within 5 minutes. I'd prefer more of a challenging and complex game.
B001HC8516|5.0|This was truly honest. It helped me get over a guy I was crushing on and realize that he just wasn't into me.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Graphics are nice and looks like it could be fun, but with no throttle control you're simply speeding from bank to bank and spinning circles trying to go in the right direction. I can tell they tried to give it some realistic boat physics but it is simply to difficult to control at WOT 100% of the time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|With only a few very minor errors, this is the best seek and find story game I've played. Worth every penny. Great story and layout and enjoyable puzzles. Will be playing this more than once. Great game!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Well made game. Pretty easy to get the hang of but can tell it will be hard to master. Like the graphics. Biggest con is probably the repetitive music.
0345529057|5.0|The books are great and the price is fabulous. I highly recommend reading this book. I can wait for the 6th book to come out and for season 4 of the show.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I love that this book mixes mythology with the present day. Fun and exciting read. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I did not order this item. My grandson (age 7 yrs) must have clicked item for purchase without my knowledge. Please remove charges.<br />How can a child order without my password???<br />Thank you ahead of time for removing this charge.<br />I can't rate something I know nothing about.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I am one of those people who have to read the book first and then the movie.  this time I did it in reverse and Disney did a great job portraying the book.  I liked both
B003G4W49C|5.0|Worth the read even if you don't normally go for sci-fi because Card's characters are some of the best!<br />Try it
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I love the games like this where you match three of the same color and it disappears. It's addicting, and so is this game. I would have  loved to give it five stars, but unfortunately, I cannot. This game is a money sucker. Even though you can earn coins throughout the game, you more often than not never use them. I have lots of coins piled up because I can't use them. If I run out of bubbles or lives, or I just want a spell, it doesn't ask me to pay with the coins, it asks a dollar or two for each. I wish I could give it five stars, but it asks me at every corner for money. If you're rich, or very patient, I would recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked the game a lot! It was a little challenging and that kept it interesting :) I can't wait until the next update!
B004G8QHKO|5.0|I appreciate it when the CD was deliveried on time. I could have my fashion show music and the sound was bery nice.
B0037NVM1I|3.0|We have seen Terminator 2 when it first was released.  Decided to let our kids watch for the first time.  The movie itself is still a very entertaining 4-star action movie.  However, the audio of the streamed version from Amazon was too low to hear well.<br /><br />We tried the Netflix version, which had a better audio, but still too low.  Then I remembered that we had the DVD with THX and watched that instead.  Even though it was not a Blu-ray, the audio was excellent.<br /><br />Streaming video is convenient, but poor audio made this movie unwatchable.
B0000524EM|5.0|it was better than i expected....all dvds played to perfection...no scratches that caused skips or anything....i would definitely buy from the again:)
B000UJ48O0|5.0|My husband and I are completely in love with the O.C. so when I seen this on amazon I just had to jump at the great deal!
B005R32L66|2.0|Its slow, and doesn't sync up with my Skype on otner devices. Also, video and sound don't work at all.
B008220BLG|5.0|Cute little Romeo and Juliet zombie movie!  I liked it because it wasn't bloody, I hate blood and gore so it was up my ally.  Cute little story, with cute little actors!  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it!
B0035HKWLW|5.0|My kids had been begging to see this and it didn't let them down. They loved it. Jim Carrey is a riot.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Most technical book is dry and heard to read from cover to cover. This book keeps your interest going while entertain at the same time. Highly recommend it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I had been using a similar device to interface between a laptop running Windows XP and a Yaesu FT-950 transceiver for Ham Radio Deluxe.  When I upgraded the laptop to one running Windows 8 the interface no longer worked.  After trying several setup configurations in Ham Radio Deluxe I determined the interface was the problem.  When I installed the Prolific PL2303H everything started working as before the laptop upgrade.  I have not experienced any problems interfacing to the FT-950.  The interface just works, no messing around required!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This movie came and went quickly in theaters.  The lead roles were perfectly cast.  More people should see this &#34;little&#34; film.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Awesome<br />This game is really sweet.  I play it all the time and dont regret the wasted hours that i have spent.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Truly fun to play and I enjoy the little fish. Game keeps you motivated to get points and fill your tank for prizes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. I enjoy the hidden clues and riddles in each room. Recommended for those who love a challenge.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I had already watched this on Showtime.  I did record it and have watched it countless times.  Everyone who watches it (Eagle fan or not), can't pull themselves away!!  I bought this for my pilates instructor/friend, who is a huge fan and does not have access to view it on cable (children & $).  I surprised her with it along with tickets to the show when they come to our city.  She loves it & watches it over and over any chance she gets!!  She also loves the bonus concert dvd that comes with it!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|A few new wrinkles, but the same old familiar characters. Some levels are very east and some I am still working on 3* and feel like I may never.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I have all of The National's albums, and this one is fantastic.  Their sound is a bit more akin to Radiohead on this one, which is a compliment.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoy this games as I like puzzle games.  This would be a good game to play with your kids.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I've always enjoyed Lana's voice, so I decided to pick up her album.  This album was really good! Every single song I enjoyed.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Fantastic set list. I really enjoyed the songs that Priest hasn't played live in the recent past: Nightcrawler, Never Satisfied, Blood Red Skies, Prophecy, Heading out to the Highway, Rapid Fire, etc. The DVD is just as good as \\"Angel of Retribution\\". The feeling is intense and Halford shines. Faulkner does a good job but I don't think his guitar comes thru the mix really well, unfortunately. A must-have DVD.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Would recommend this movie. Great acting. A lot of plot twists that keep you guessing. We enjoyed it very much.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I love this show it has a great progression of characters and is good science fiction. I am looking forward to watching all seasons
B0066W1AZK|4.0|As a full time chess instructor and coach, I'm always looking for go basic chess apps for my students. This app is easy to use. I highly recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One of those books that you can't put down and then can't forget. A wonderful story for young and old.
0425264351|5.0|I had trouble getting started with the book - it just didn't hold my interest.  But hang in there!  I soon found myself unable to put the book down. I plan to read each book in the series!  I recommend the book and the author.
B005M5XCZ8|4.0|I did not like the other xmen films at all. I watched this only because the director of layer cake did this one. Fassbender was fantastic as Magneto, he brought charisma to the character that was lacking in the other xmen films. Mcavoy does a great job as Xavier and the overall look of the film as well as the music was very well done.
0385536828|3.0|This new novel by McEwan is so bland and vanilla that I almost forgot to write a review.  I read the whole book and fairly quickly, and forgot it almost as quickly.  It did not make any lasting mental effect on me, unlike McEwan's great novels such as Enduring Love and Atonement.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about Sweet Tooth is the London setting.  McEwan obviously loves London and the south of England and uses real street names and locales.  For some reason, I appreciate that.  I also learned about the Lanes in Brighton, which we somehow missed when we lived in London and explored the South Downs.<br /><br />Other than that Sweet Tooth has a lot of meandering thoughts about fiction, writing, and novels--I guess that's \\"metafiction\\"--none of which seemed very serious or interesting.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth is better than Solar.  But frankly I'm afraid that McEwan has lost his moxie.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|Seiko does it again. this watch looks great and no batteries. I love it. very clear face and easy to read.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Just finished watching The Tree of Life with Brad Pitt and I'm still in aww. So many reviewers here summed up exactly how I felt after seeing this film. This movie is in the words of another reviewer visually stunning, and beautiful meditative work of art. It's not like anything I have ever seen. Some people may find it boring if they are expecting a typical Hollywood movie, but for those with a open mind this movie will take you on a journey. The power of this film lies with the story being told through the breathtaking visuals and very little dialogue. Truly a work of art and like another reviewer said it best \\"the film derails from the barrier of a typical Hollywood movie and communicated with the viewer on a deeper level kind of like poetry.\\" I could not agree more.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I am not going to review the movies themselves. By now everyone reading this will have likely seen them all and have their own feelings on them. The first one is obviously a classic. The second and third, while not as good or original as the first, still stand up as worthy sequels. I know some people love and others hate the sequels. That is something that is totally subjective, but if you only love the first, it is available as a single disc blu ray as well.<br /><br />The A/V quality of all three films are great. Even the first movie which of course was just on the cusp of the CGI generation looks like it was done with today's technology in the blu ray transfer. The real meat though is for the bonus material nerds. Each film has many different making of and behind the scenes features. The bonus material are as long as the movies themselves. Of course the first movie has the most extensive bonus features, but each movie has a lot. So for those who do want the physical discs as opposed to a digital download you will get a lot for your money. The other thing I liked is that Universal went back to just the regular disc cases. Anyone who bought the Back to the Future set or some of the newer TV series sets know how universal started packaging things that kept the discs in place. They are hard to describe, but a total pain in the ass to get the discs out. These just went back to the old style where you can just pull them right out. Not a huge issue, but nice nevertheless.<br /><br />As I said, everyone has their opinions of the movies, but if you are considering getting the trilogy on blu ray, they are a wonderful investment. I do not know how much of an upgrade from the existing DVDs the blu rays are because I waited to get the movies until they were put out on blu ray, but I can tell you that (especially for an initial purchase of the trilogy) it is well worth it.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|A short but deep journey into two completely different worlds and the effect they can have on one person drawn to both.  Moshin Hamid writes with prose that create empathy and an easy connection to the character.<br />A worthy read.
B00947N6UG|4.0|this movie was excellent on blu ray and dvd. the animation is very nice and the story is engaging. I think it is a very good film worthy of children and adults time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm not sure what makes this show so compelling, but the combination of workplace drama and tension at home keep me coming back.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm a writer and I often write three stories at once. One night, I was reaching for a pencil and the water glass I had spilled on all of my stuff and I was devastated. But now, I finally have a place to organize all my stuff!!!! :)
1469220725|1.0|Trashy.........Can't describe it.  The only way you can determine how trashy it can be is to read it and I don't recommend that!
B00B769XB8|5.0|A good fantasy, full of action and adventure. I also enjoied the humor and the Troll. I would like to see a sequil with the same actors.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|i bought these to replace my sennheisers and they are good. i can hear sounds i havent heard before. good headphones for metal
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I love that I can look at maps offline whenever or wherever I am. I just wish it would download all the States from the start but other than that it works awesome!
B0043J08C4|5.0|Absolutely the best 'Predator' movie since the original. The story is tight and believable, the acting is engaging, and the action has great pace and suspense. I give a lot of credit to director Nimrod Antal for paying homage to the first movie in ways fans would enjoy, but also doing much more to put his own stamp on the franchise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I down loaded this App for my  grand-daughter, she is 9 years old and loves playing it. It is one of her favorite games.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|needed this app badly but its constantly crashing. maybe it needs an update?? would love to be able to use it properly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'm think though Mojang should release 10.0.0  that would be EPIC!! Although they did add cake and spawn eggs. That's better than nothing.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Of course the book is always better, but I love the tv series so much I thought it wouldn't be true in this case, but it is true. I love this book!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game it is really fun and the best part is that it is free you should try it out
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Cool to see this classic in 3D.  Video is not up to todays standards as some screen are a little grainy and some of the 3d scenes are not the &#34;looking thru glass&#34; feeling, but overal a nice step up from the original DVD in terms of quality.  The 3D of course adds a different viewing perspective.  Recommended.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I just love to see movies made from comic books (except green hornet, yikes!).  This one is exceptional.  Great special effects and theater. I could watch this movie 1xmonth no problem.  Hope you enjoy this one too.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Was a good movie , enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot.  Would watch again on a night I was looking for a movie to watch but not my all time favorite.
1781162646|5.0|I am never disappointed when I pick up a novel or short story written by Stephen King. I can never get enough.

B00846REIS|5.0|Read it one day! Couldn't put it down. I love the characters and can't wait to read the next book!
0307476073|5.0|This book is a gem - I literally cried with gratitude as I got close to the end, then sadness upon finishing it! The first chapter was a little tedious at times, but stick with it - it's well worth your time.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|A well paced and surprisingly touching film. At first I was concerned about the subject matter of incest, but the director did a good job of establishing all the characters early. The film then became a touching love story. If you can get past the idea of incest, this film is worth a watch.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen in terms of making you question your beliefs regarding life, death, the afterlife, and how the decisions you make can alter the future.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so glad to see this on Prime had waited for this season so much going on.  You must start with the first season to follow along it is not one you can just begin in the middle.  Great writing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|at first it.  is hard to understand all of the details and controls but you get used to it and it is very entertaining
B005DJREGQ|1.0|If this is truly how high school is and kids and parents behave then this is a nightmare.  I lasted 10 minutes.  Ridiculous and completely unentertaining (is that even a word?).
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I went to see this movie with my so, and absolutely loved it. So I was excited to buy this video at such a great price. My son and I watched it again as soon as we received it in the mail. The delivery was very quick too.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was cute and very funny. I laughed out loud several times. It's a great movie for kids and adults.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Wonderful movie get for a date night, or just a group of girls. No vampires, no teenaged, just a love story with an interesting ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as fun as the first Temple Run but better. One of the few games I love to play and always come back to!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. I checked several other video streaming sites and found that this movie was unavailable, so I was so excited to discover that it was available on Amazon and that we could watch it through the PS3 on our television as a family. The cost for this movie was minimal and it was worth every dime. Amazon Prime Instant Streaming is definitely one of the advantages of being a Prime member.
B00BI745AA|3.0|which is what you expect from a musical.  Great acting, of course and amazing cinematography!  My husband lasted maybe an hour and I made it through but kept wondering if it would ever end!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Has everything I love about Ebay and works flawlessly on my android device giving me access whenever and wherever I want.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I always like Denzel Washington and I thought the book he wanted to deliver was a great concept for the end of the world scenario.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't even explain how much I love this book it's like a really good action movie u recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great book
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a fun game for all ages but great for younger kids ages 3 and up. It is easy enough to maneuver without much skill, at first, and start without a wait or having to read through a bunch of &#34;helpful hints&#34; or &#34;outfit&#34; choices.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story and can't wait for more!!! It is hard to put it down and go to sleep at night!
B005HSG3U6|2.0|I purchased this product for my 15 yr. old boy. I was disappointed in the quality. As soon as I touched the case...it felt cheap..like it was<br />made anywhere except America..The stand for this device is a joke..highly unstable. I gave this 2 stars instead of one because it fit onto<br />the kindle perfectly and it was a nice &#34;face lift&#34; for the device...it is good for in home use only..just don't drop it..it may not survive it!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Please android store. Add more final fantasy content for my kindle!!! I will buy them all! The ipod store has like 12 SE console titles, we get 1.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|My 16-year old daughter and I watch this show. It's good clean drama. There is rarely any cuss words or lack of class to the show. It shows how women used to be and men were gentlemen. And although there is some stark reminders of how the \\"classes\\" used to be, it still serves a grand purpose of dignity. I, \\"we\\" like it!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Reminds me so much of college days in Massachussetts! Love this cd! It's raw and fine tuned. Great music ~
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great search and comparison app for ebay sellers to research product information and keep up to date with ebay seller account tools and features on tablet devices.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this!!if you love building then you should definitely get this app....I highly recommend it!!!I know you have to pay for this joining game thing but,it is soooooo worth it,just so you know that u have the demo first ,because  you could learn a lot from minecraft video's on YouTube,just try your hardest cause I know you will have so much fun on this app!!!  :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great puzzle game wish there were more rooms would of kept going. Agree witlh other reviews it was difficult but not so hard as to not make it fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!  Loved Seasons 1 and 2.  Season 3 is just as good.  It's no wonder everyone is hooked and eagerly waiting for season 4!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The levels were just challenging enough without frustrating me! I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a little brain exercise.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love this cd! I have it on nearly every day. Great songs, not just one, they're all great! Very happy with this purchase!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Story and directing is so clever that force you to follow the show for ever!<br />Honestly I'm not a fan of this kind of show, (I mean old fashion style) but every episode you see at the end they have something to make you force to follow the show!<br />Beside that the production of the show is not cheap and you going to enjoy almost everything about this show!<br />I watched up to season 3 and I can't wait to see season 4!!!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|One of the better reads, Abercrombie's gritty, savage fantasy series is in fine form here, highlighted by the Bloody Nine's triumphant return. About the only thing that keeps me from rating it a full five stars is the fact that Abercrombie's characters are constantly talking and thinking in kitschy metaphors, similes, and country wisdom &#34;you-know-what-they-say...&#34; type lines.<br /><br />We get it, these are 'just folk'. Now can they talk like real people? Please?
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|this movie is one of the best movies I ever seen, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone 13 and older.  Awesome movie.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|If you have ever been interested in improving your memory you should read this book.  Mr. Foer takes you though the history, science, and some of the techniques on how to improve your memory exponentially in a very short amount of time.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I saw this movie Friday with my girlfriend and I must say that it did not live up to the intrigue it's title created in the trailers. What made me want to see this film was to find out what Z meant. When I saw that it was just a zombie movie all of my interest up to this point was gone. To be honest, the film reminded me too much of the original \\"28 Days Later,\\" which was more plausible and scarier by comparison.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away what anyone other than me initially already knows about the film. It is a zombie film. A global rabies epidemic causes humans to turn into zombies. They can't really be killed other than by burning or shot in the head. And these zombies, unlike Romero's, are very fast.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's ok in the film as a scientist. The special effects were decent and seamless, nothing spectacular. There were a few \\"shock\\" scenes in the movie but nothing remotely scary in my opinion. Other than the title, there was absolutely nothing innovative about the film at all, just a routine zombie film with a big name actor in it. Spielberg, I understand, predicted Hollywood's demise (as we know it). They keep churning out films like this and all these sequels, it might be over sooner than later. BTW, my girlfriend fell asleep and we left about halfway through the movie. IMO, save your money!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought the battery to use as back up power for a GPS on a rented moto while on a trip to Spain. The battery held a charge all day, I was able to navigate, and a s a bonus, I charged my iPhone in the airport on the way home!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have been watching the TV show and the book is so much better,  I can now tell the nations apart and can better follow the characters.  I have now started book 2 and am enjoying it also.  Books a must read to follow the tv versions.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Another great game from game loft. Even with energy limitations you are able to play through them by adding and visiting friends. Unfortunately with a lack of competent servers I don't have access to all features of the game at all time...
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Somehow the filmakers across the sea manage to create characters that are so unique and charming or, in some cases despicable, that you become enthralled with just watching and listening to them.  This series is no exception.  If you have watched Downton Abbey, you will recognize Brendan Coyle from his role as Bates.  In the Lark Rise series he is a stone mason with a wonderful large family and a deep sense of morality which he shares freely.<br />Other characters can be seen in other series such a &#34;Call the Midwife&#34; another winner.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Not much action but lots to reflect on, as applicable today as when it was written.  Clear, engaging prose style.
B005LAIIPS|1.0|This film is a travesty to the trilogy created before it and especially to the books written by Ludlum and Lustbader. If you are attracted to this title because it says Bourne, don't bother watching. On the other hand, if you like movies with one really long, pointless chase scene, this movie is definitely for you.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|A good movie for the children and adults, if they have to watch.  This was filmed in Astoria which is just across the river from us.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I will mourn the end of this book.  Great characters, terrific mystery. Very well written. Best of Kate Morton's novels.
B00B8P3EOU|5.0|This is a nice Alpert piece that is a smooth transitional bridge from the  Tijuana Brass days and his \\"smmoth jazz\\"  Stan Getz tribute album:  \\"Midnight Sun\\" . Both are really nice easy listening albums.
B005ES12S2|5.0|It's my first time to try Crocs.<br /><br />And it's comfortable. I like it every much.<br /><br />And I wear it almost everyday.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is amazing and so fun to play and fyi did not mean to push the report abuse button<br />Wow I love it
0307454541|5.0|A page turner. Larsson created wonderful mental pictures of the setting and characters.The action moved quickly. This book caused me to continue his trilogy with The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's nest.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great time passer. I was a fan of the old Hungry Shark game, but it got to the point of seeming pointless... adding the evolution aspect was a great idea.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show good story line I'm not a wus or anything but it usually has one or two moments every episode that kind of pull on your heart strings
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|A fairly accurate depiction of Carl Sagan's novel, the movie Contact had me rethink some of my own assumptions about the possibility of alien life, how humanity might react to the discovery that we are not alone in the universe, and even God.  I won't type more words because it would be an awful waste of space...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|These guys are the truest of American Heroes.  This is an excellent account of America's most deadly sniper in history and we will miss him dearly!!!  So sad he was killed helping those who served this great nation.
0143116371|5.0|Bought the Sartorialist Closer first then purchased this book.  Loved both. Look at both the books when I want to be inspired to be creative in my clothing choices.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Takes to much time to design and create. I have more important things to do. I truly hate Amazon`s frustrating need for more words.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I always wondered about the lyrics of iconic albums like 'Tommy' 'Who's next' etc. The further through the book I got the more I realize what a genius P.T. really is. There is also a similarity between the control he had over The Who that Roger Waters had over Pink Floyd. I am kind of a geek for the process of writing and recording incredible albums so this book goes into some incredible detail. While I am a huge fan of the Who I appreciate P.T. for being a complete recording artist, writer, producer, performer and philanthropist. Quite simply P.T. is an inspiration and I'm glad to know all the details. Well done Pete!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered what seemed like a perfectly legit brand new Sony Dualshock 3 from a seller called Tech Gone Wild LLC. I've had it for two months now, and it has revealed its true nature since then. The joysticks are spongy, the paint is already rubbing off, something is rattling around I inside, low battery life, and syncing is a constant issue, and I can only play PS2 games with it if I keep it plugged in. At first I thought my Playstation was messed up, but I googled the part number of the controller today and learned that it is a Hong Kong copycat product. Check your part number against against Sony's website! These fakes are low quality but the are VERY convincing at first glance (nice packaging, Sony branding, button placement, etc.) This may be a vendor issue too, so be careful if you buy from Tech Gone Wild LLC. It's a shame that this kind of thing slips past Amazon's radar.
B002RVZVO0|5.0|I ordered this in 2012 because I didn't see any Beatles Live DVDs and I Found this one. It said 1966 so I knew this would be an interesting for my huge Beatles' collection. And when I arrived in the mail it was in a white baggie package thing. And it said 2 Shows, and that added to my excitement. And I watched the First DVD and it was in good quality and great sound. Although they were slow and out of key on If I Needed Someone, it was a great show! But the other show had the same setlist and the quality wasn't as good as the first, but this purchase is a MUST HAVE for any Beatle Collector, or fan!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown overcame the grueling requirements to be a SEAL as well as his own Demons!!!  Unbelievable story.  God Bless his family and friends for their perseverance to help make Adam realize a wonderful life as one of America's elite warriors.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|cult film classic my fav. part is when the chic says &#34;Here I made this for thee!&#34;. And Bruce replies &#34;Good, I could use a horse blanket!&#34;. hahaha
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Plenty of action and explosions if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Very cool action and special effects.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim and was surprised how much I liked it. Frustrating times yet worth the torment. Kudos to the creators- please add more levels
B004UO0SAO|5.0|Nice implementation of an HP emulator.  My &#34;real&#34; one is often on my desk or in my briefcase and not in front of me when I need it.  My Kindle, with my newspapers, magazines and books, often is.  Nice job!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I'm very surprised about the average rating of this book. The story is mildly entertaining if you completely ignore plausibility. That's the only plus I can think of. Otherwise it's very poorly written. There are about 50plus \\"he shrugged\\", \\"she shrugged\\", everyone is shrugging. Many short/choppy/incomplete sentences. Like this. Very annoying.  Not just for affect. The whole book. Annoying.  Additionally, the author does not have a good understanding of either military or firearms, and ironically, this whole book depends largely on both.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an amazing story of grit, toughness and courage of the Navy Seals.  This is a must read for everyone!!!
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|could not even watch this show past the first 20 minutes, my boyfriend, my kid and me would rather pick our nose then watch this. We all starting to fall asleep or became distracted while trying to watch.  waste of $
0689835604|5.0|Baby gets fascinated by the fact that you can lift the flap! Plus the story is super cute - would recommend this one.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I thought it captured loneliness and fear of high school well.  It's not cheesy, but it's somewhat predictable.  Still enjoyable.  I would recommend renting it if you're in the mood for that kind of movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it a second time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app, highly recommended - so easy to use, to search and find passages, to jump to different texts, etc. Love that there are so many foreign language texts available as well....
B003VANOFY|1.0|Bass is louder in left speaker.<br />7.1 surround is fake (emulated) and I had to disable it anyway to fix some problems.<br />Mic output is low quality.<br /><br />I feel like logitech sold a dream on this one.  The idea is nice, but the lack of quality kills it.  Hardware seems ok but the software seems to break key features.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I wasn't able to watch a single video because it just keeps crashing. The interface looks nice, but what good is that if you can't go anywhere after that?
B004UPAIDK|5.0|I saw this when I was 7 back in the 80's and I still love it!! Good acting, storyline, and directing.
B003LPR4ZK|2.0|This is a story where nothing happens: the characters don't grow, there are no pivotal events. And the read-aloud format is gratingly overdone.  Nice try for Mel Brooks but he's so much better at comedy.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I'm not fond of the artists who go into the studio to do &#34;the standards&#34; as Rod Stewart and others have done.  I took a chance with Jeff Lynne after hearing his version of &#34;She&#34; and the entire CD is packed with one great version after another and it doesn't sound like &#34;covers&#34; at all.  If you like the sound of ELO or Jeff Lynne's solo releases, there is no way you wouldn't love this release.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love all the versions and easy to bookmark where you left off! I don't have the time to pick up a bible so this is the best way to be in touch with the Lord no matter what day/time!
B001DF68MA|5.0|We have always enjoyed biking, but when our kids were little the only seats for little ones seemed to be behind us.  Now we have a great way for our grandchildren to go along.  The seat is wonderful for the 18 month old, and I'm sure she'll use it for at least another 18 month.  One addition WeeRide should consider is some sort of handlebars so the little one can pretend to be part of the steering action.  Our wee rider likes to grab the real handlebars which can be a little precarious.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for everyone, kids had a great time and I Really enjoyed. A must have movie for any movie animation collector.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its just an ok Game I do play it alot when I am bored and there is nothing else to do.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Convoluted family story revealed a century later envelops a reader making hard to put this book down. Good writing style. Would recommend this book.
B001NLKT60|4.0|With a slow start we learn of how Lizbeth's life has changed, yet remains the same. Her life has improved in many ways and she is pleased with her new home and assets, but there is the ever-haunting uneasiness of some impending danger. Her fears are realized soon enough as two friends if Blomvist are murdered with Elizabeth accused as the psycho-lesbian responsible. Finally we get to the real action. YOU GO GIRL.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Works great on my Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus ( small text but readable when zoomed in on the cards) It is a VERY LARGE game. They should figure out a way to reduce the size, 1.2 GB is way to big.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far I have really enjoyed this game. It challenging and not boring. If you like puzzles this game is for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am rather new to Pinterest but am totally and completely hooked.  I love the craft ideas and look forward to making a lot of them.  There are a lot of great ideas on here and amazing pictures.  =)
B008FOB124|4.0|A friend of me talked me about that group which I heard the name maybe 10 years ago. On a flight abroad this album was to listen in the earphones. I was really surprised and bought the CD back home. I don't know about their musuc before but this one is excellent....
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Definately worth watching.  It kept me interested as I usually fall asleep during a movie any more.  Give it a shot.
0385349947|5.0|the book is easy to read. There are a lot of good examples to show her points. It changes how I should do to my career. I will recommend it to friends.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|As usual, a very good book from Philippa Gregory.  I found her slant on the story of Richard III and his Neville wife to be very different from the way it is usually portrayed.  It may have been so...
0316228532|5.0|Honestly, it's pretty good! Takes a little time for the reader to get adjusted to who is who and to get the flow of the story but otherwise it was quite great!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The visual effects and color were outstanding and it may be worth viewing the movie for this alone.  The flying Baboons were scary so be careful with young children viewing the show.  However, the acting was &#34;so so&#34;.  Most disapointing was  the fact that the story-line was not well integrated with the original Oz movie (Judy Garland).  I also found it disconcerting that the young witch was turned to the darkside due to the romantic escapades of the so called &#34;Great and Wonderful&#34; Oz.  The writers should be tarred and feathered.
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|Have been a Poco fan since Indian Summer and Legend.  They could do Pinky Lee and I'd like it.  My favorite vocalist (and guitarist) was Paul Cotton, but the band still holds it up good anyway.  If Rusty Young retires, well I don't know about that. That might do 'em in for good.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|After the disappointment of \\"Point de suture\\" and \\"Bleu Noir\\" where Mylene was less than her usual flawless. I must say that still in comparison to others who have been around that long, they were still very good effort but the problem is that one always compares Mylene to Mylene and the previous two efforts were somewhat boring....(can't believe I said that!)<br />So when Monkey me came out, I was really sceptical and especially with the new dance/techno stuff that she's done, and looking at the album cover, I said Oh No, she's giving us another point de suture but HEY HEY HEY!<br /><br />This album is one of her most cohesive (and I have been a fan since very early days, the 80's when I was in school). We must all accept that time has moved on and so has Mylene and so has Laurent Boutonat. Thy style has become more dance oriented but in actual fact, you can still see and feel Laurent's fantastic ability to produce fabulous and lush melodies. Throughout the whole album from start to finish, the melodies and production are fantastic. Mylene's voice is beautiful and pure as always. Whils I may have likes some songs more than others, they eventually kind of merged into each other and I like them all now. Highlights inially are : Monkey Me, Love dance, Ne le dis pas, ici-bas & Quand. As time went by all the others grew on me too: Elle a dit, J'ai essaye de vivre, A-t-on Jamais. The common factor is that the music is so well written and so sweet and tickles your ears.<br /><br />You have to have an open mind and not expect another \\"Pourvu q'ils soient douces\\" or \\"Sans conrefacon\\" or \\"Je te rends ton amour\\" or \\"Inamoramento\\" or even \\"F**** them all\\". The style undoubtedly has changed and is certainly directed to the current music buyer and is more dance oriented but most certainly without losing the original and unique Mylene Farmer-Laurent Boutonat style which has stood the test of time over more than 28 years. No one else in France and in actual fact elsewhere has been able to do that. She is till on top of the album charts with every single album of hers and still has number one singles , actually more of recent than ever before. I can tell you the CD is in my car on continuous spin/rotation for the last two months and I haven't put any other music to listen to....still bet excited starting long drives to be in the delicious company of Mylene and Laurent.<br /><br />A reassuring return to what we love best about them<br /><br />Love and respect to Mylene for keeping us in love and respect ! xxable to do that.

1401233384|4.0|The book itself was in great condition  and arrived quickly. ( The reason for the 4 stars)<br /><br />The content was also good, not great but a worthwhile read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|7.2 was supposed to come out yesterday and it's the day after 7.2 was supposed to come out  also pretty good game I gave it 5 stars
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This is an excellent, period movie.  Not for the faint of heart, with plenty of violence, as most of QT's works are, this is one of the very best.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much.  In fact I watched it three times.  The acting was fabulous.  Especially worthy of applause is Sally Fields.<br />Although much of the intimate aspects of Lincoln's life were fabricated by Speilberg (because of the lack of documentation), it is my opinion that the writers did a good job developing background subplots that wove into the fabric of the overall story line.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Overall the game is quite fun, addictive as well.however can get quite monotonous but the challenges make it interesting. Very enjoyable game, a good buy.
B004ZZFMTK|4.0|I like Julia Child a lot. Her sense of humour, her love for her craft. But it is not easy to follow the recipes.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Wish it was first person, but just as good. Love the feel of this on my tablet. Classic gaming at it's best!
B009LMTDL0|1.0|For a book that received so much positive reviews, I was extremely disappointed after finishing the book. This book is not practical and pretty much repetitive chapter after chapter. i could not find myself relate to Sheryl Sandberg's so called challenges she faces on a daily basis. I wish I can get my money and the time wasted back.
B003B02O14|3.0|Story started out interesting, but everything seemed to go predictably.  I was expecting some more suspenseful moments, but they never came.  The ending was even so-so.  Overall, a satisfactory read that had so much more potential.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|Watching Robocop from start to finish, you can see how the storyline was maintained to the very end.  Robocop 1 is hands down the best in the trilogy exposing you to how the cyborg called Robocop came to be and just how advanced Omni Consumer Products (OCP) is and how great yet how sinister the corporation is.  Robocop 2 carries on very well from the first adding more action packed scenes and exposing you to the pivotal move that brings about the decline of OCP Corporation.  Robocop 3, although being good, still leaves more to be desired on top of leaving out the original actor of Robocop in the past two movies, Peter Weller.  Robocop 3 carries on with the storyline showing you a now chaotic OCP on the collapse that has since been taken over by the Japanese Corporation Katamitsu and soon the viewers will be exposed to their trump card of technology, an android!  How well does cyborg Robocop fair against a fully robotic android?  You have to see the movie.  Two thumbs up through and through!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was great. A little confusing at times, but very well written. Now I must see the movie. Great.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? After reading all of the books it was hard to imagine, yet this movie seems to pull it off. Not sure if it was through creative photography of Cruise's acting but the essence of Reacher seems to have been captured in this movie - very enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a really fun game. I like horses and this is a cool way to pretend to have your own horse.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you have any doubts, this is a good read. It is well written so that everyone can understand it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't live without this app when away from home.  It allows me to see new pins and capture my own new pins. I have so many pins that I have to follow through on.  It allows me to pull the recipes up in the grocery store when trying to determine something special to make for the family or class treats.  It allows me to see projects on my phone or tablet to determine products I need to purchase.  Just an all-around useful tool.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Third Favourite after Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility . Witty, entertaining, - It has romance, intrigue, villains - heroines. Always enjoy reading it again and again.
0425263924|5.0|I love the Crossfire series, Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer.  It was too long of a wait for the third book to come out I was going nuts looking for something else to read.  Can't wait for the next book in the series, please don't make me wait too long.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Haiestorm is a great cd. litte on the hard side but awsome. loved evry track on the CD.give it a try.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like it, . Because it's challenging and there is and Story. hope i don't get stuck or I get bored  ; )
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy this TV program, high level of entertainment.<br />Leave it to the British to continue producing interesting story lines.
1878424114|5.0|I am on a journey to joy and this has been great in helping me get there.  This book share knowledge that is basic, but not often valued in our western culture.  With this information, I am learning to be open, act with intention, and not box my self in to the limits of my personal knowledge.  So worth the read.
0060987464|5.0|I had this book years ago before an EX took it with her when she moved out. i'm just happy to have this book again in my life. \m&#62;_&#60;\m/
1594746168|3.0|The fact that many corpses were dragged illegally from their graves to further the cause of improving medical science is by now a well known fact. It is the effect that this may have had on a grave robbers son and assistant that is explored in 'The Resurrectionist' by E.B. Hudspeth.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a brief biography of Dr. Stephen Black, which is told in a matter of fact tone which stands in contrast with the occasional excerpts form Black's increasingly unhinged journal, a book within a book if you will. As a child of 10 or 11 he was conscripted, along with his brother Bernard, into his father's (also a doctor) sideline of stealing corpses, with the horror one would expect from a child of this age.<br /><br />As he grows up, attending medical school, and then practicing medicine himself, he become convinced that human mutation, conjoined twins, extra digits, foreshortened limbs etc, are manifestations of earlier mythological beings, cast aside during evolution but appearing in modern man from time to time. His increasingly adamant conviction and the measures he goes to to proves them lead to the expected results with colleagues and his wife and brother, and sets him and his family down an increasingly dark path which I don't want to give away here, suffice it to say it ends with quite a mystery that had me wishing Hudspeth had fleshed out and finished this part of the book, though I realizedthat a little mystery in horror is a good thing.<br /><br />The second part of the book represents the work and sketches of Black, who was an excellent artist and taxidermist, as well as a doctor. It is also the part most difficult for me to judge since I read an incomplete proof that was missing many of the illustrations. What there were were beautifully done with notes on each creature, such as harpies, different varieties of mermaid, centaurs and the like, laid out in a way the recalls natural history texts.<br /><br />It took my quite awhile to review this as my 11 year old son, picked it right after it arrived and got sucked into it. He loved it, so if you have any advanced middle school readers (particularly boys who seem to adore the ewww! factor at this age, I'd recommend it to them as well as readers of horror, mystery and fans of mythological creatures and natural history
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's fun and addictive, the only problem is when you play connect the stars, the timer starts right away even when you didnt touch anything and if you finish a split second before the timer is up it will show you the score you might have won, then it flips and gives you a lower score, change that and I'll give it 5 stars.
0345529057|5.0|It just took fifteen days to be delivered to Chengdu,China. I was a little surprised when it reached me,because according to the order it would take a month. And the books are exactly what i expected. FULL STARS.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I'm not sure he really follows the directions, but he loves everything that came in the box.  Great shipping, and was sent as a gift too.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Bought it to encourage my son who has been diagnosed with autism to initiate speech.  He (7 years old) and my 3-year-old daughter  love to her Tom Cat echo back their words.  Great free app.  Wish there was a way to disable the links for purchasing additional products without the upgrade.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish it gave you a few hints sometimes other than that its a ok game .if you like puzzels you like it
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the movie and love the game.  It keeps the little ones entertained for hours.  Gotta love that.  It has great graphics, adventures, colorful, awesome.  I recommend this one to all who love Nemo
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics. Would like to &quot;build&quot; my own horse though. Activities are good. Need a timer for more realistic horse chores.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a cool game which allows the user to care for, and compete in competitions with a sweet n gentle horse.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Plays very good and has great graphics.If you are a magic player from expert to novice and want to play magic this is the app for you. I am playing on a Kindle fire and everything works great. Best app I have bought for kindle.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little slow in some parts other wise it was an interesting read.  It had a lot of surprises.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|when these cost 3 bucks a picture, you would figure they had the film dialed in by now. if you take a picture in the sunlight, they will be overexposed, even if you keep the picture out of direct contact with the sunlight. not worth the money. thinking about getting the fuji instax. i've had a lot more success with that camera and film
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I never read the book, but this film did not have a choppy feel like you would get in an adaptation. By the way, the cinematography is fresh & vibrant and the CGI is amazing. You are eased into the whole thing with a description of the Pi's early days in India, his experimentation with a mix of religions and the dynamics of his family life. The plot moves along quite comfortably such that you don't feel rushed, neither do you feel bored. Before you know it, you are thoroughly caught up with the all the emotions of a shipwrecked Pi and his fierce Bengal tiger. I kept waiting for the tiger to become a beloved kitty cat, but it made the film interesting that he didn't (steel yourselves to be frightened by menacing growls & lunges). The movie has a twist at the end which I will not reveal. However once you watch the film in it's entirety, ask yourself the following questions: 1. \\"Which story do I believe?\\"  and 2. \\"What does my answer reveal about my true nature & my belief about the nature of humanity?\\" Your answers will determine which story you choose to be yours.:)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic story.  I hope it's not ruined by turning it into a blockbuster film.  If it is, I'm sending Mr. Howey out for cleaning....in a French maid's outfit.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Not what I wanted/expected at all.<br />Do not waste your money on this. I bought it so I could write on the go, and it does not function like that at all. I'm highly against this worthless product, and still wish I could find an app to write my stories/poetry on fluently.
B0030B621W|5.0|This movie was very interesting as well as original. It was slow at times, but non the less interesting . The originality of the film is what made it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Was a great movie. It made you laugh and was a funny plot with a little love story as well.
0786958731|5.0|Super fun game, i'd say if you love dnd its a must get because you can use all the pieces in this game for your actual dnd storyies and figures are a must get.<br /><br />one thing that bugges me was the box was a bit crushed even though it was layed up so many times for protection. no biggie tho
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Wonderful. Hard I put down. Read all 3 in a long weekend. I can't wait till the 4th comes out.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Really wanted to see this in the theater but did not make it. The story makes a great prequel to the original movie.
1593082800|2.0|I know this Wilkiethon was a major, major best-seller in 1860 et al . . . and it created a genre, sort of . . . and it has a most interesting initial set-up.  But this is a 150 page novella stretched like bad underwear into a 600+ page You Gotta Be Kidding Me special. I think much of that has to do with the fact that very little of what were eye-opening surprises/horrors to Victorian readers fall into the Yeah, So What and Saw That Coming 50 pages Ago genre these days. Too many of the key players in this yackathon have characters the dimension of cheap shirt cardboard, the purported heroine is a preposterously passive, and rather unlikeable,  dumb blond, the \\"hero\\" too much of a schmuck (sorry if that offends anyone) to trod his path, and the most best character (the \\"mannish\\" half-sister), by far the most interesting person in the book simply functions as a sort of \\"hiding in the wings\\" narrator for much of the story. It does read smoothly and easily, but Collins is no Dickens or Hardy (to say the least) and it is far too easy to spot his personal dislikes in Life. (Given Collins' reputation as a hypocondriachal [sp??] pseudo-bigamist, his life is far more interesting than what's flailing around on his pages.) And there is little feel of Victorian life - other than class nastiness - that one gets from Trollope, Dickens, Hardy, Elliot, et al. I actually read this side-by-side with it's publication twin (sort of), A Tale of Two Cities . . . now THAT was a literary eye-opener exercise . . .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Omg best love story ever! Could not have ended better! All three books were amazing! Can't wait for the movies! Girls night out! One thing....we need to hear more from Christian's thoughts!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's awesome! I loved it and so far have four horses. Hope you like it!<br />Ignore<br />Jjdjsjaskdbisdhaidjwdhshdishdhhd B-) jugular k gf f2f ghgy hi gouoffhjcjgjv in cockfighting
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoy this book and can not wait for the movie to come out. The ending had  a great twist to it too.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I have been wanting the DVD for ages to watch on Groundhog Day. It was in excellent condition for being used.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|If you are an action movie buff this is a good choice for you.  Good plot with endless action, much like the &#34;Bourne&#34; series of films.  HD video streaming from Amazon was also excellent.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|If  you are over 40 and married then you will appreciate this movie.  It was wasn't all I expected but it did make for an entertaining evening.
B001KZG99A|5.0|We loved this film.  We are conservative in our movie choices and would not recommend this movie for younger children, yet, our 10-year-old son really enjoyed it.  We loved the &#34;good guy&#34; wins theme, and the action!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|So far I'm just playing the single player campaign, it's fun although not very difficult thus far. The interface is simple to use and engaging.
1582701709|5.0|Read it several times when e-mail and the book reread!<br />Positive thinking brings lots of happiness.<br />Recommend as a gift to friends the e-mail and the book.
B007SNFTAI|5.0|A very different premise for a book and it works very well indeed. Family life in a small town of small minded people and then we are torn away to life on the prairies of Canada, straight roads and highways with only silos to mark the passage. Thank you Richard Ford.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|Some people are harsh on what Clapton has been doing lately. I love it. This is a natural progression for him. There are some amazing tracks here. Taj's Further on Up the Road, All of Me and Born to Lose are great! Every Little Thing is instantly one of my favorite Clapton songs. If you're a classic Clapton fan then listen to classic Clapton. If you respect music as an evolving art and you want to see what he'll do next this is for you. Every little thing you do it beautiful Eric. Keep it up and I'll follow where you lead.
006097625X|5.0|Theory, even theory about comic books can be terribly dry and boring, but this book takes a wonderfully appropriate approach by delving into the theory behind the visual art of comic books and graphic novels using the art itself.  I bought this book as a text for a class in my masters of library information science degree, and I must say it was one of my absolute favorites.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Adults, teens & pre-teens - whole family enjoyed this movie.<br />Some parts may be too scary for teeny ones - we are very conservative with our movie choices.<br />(Children being punished by having to stay alone in a cardboard box with eye holes...)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was the most disappointing read that I can recall in a long time. I really enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy (which is, obviously, no longer a trilogy). This book came out much later than it was scheduled, which was frustrating. The story line was much weaker compared to the others and there is literally no ending. It stops mid-story and basically says \\"stay tuned\\". I think the author had a case of writers block, or was in it for the money grab. Either way, I'm done with her.
B008EAWF4W|5.0|Love the geopolitical aspects of this book.  Totally different than the movie, and even better.  Audiobook is fabulous too.  Highly recommended!
B000W198QY|5.0|Her voice is a great instrument that she uses to share stories about life and love.  A must have for any true fan!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I'm a bejeweled fan and love the relaxed mode of that game. So I was very surprised to truly enjoy the one minute challenge that this game offers.  Very addictive!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the graphics are great and load times are very speedy.  the only reason it gets 4 stars is after a while you have to start upgrading and buying things with acorns and its never cheap enough for me.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Joe doesn't disappoint with this CD. All you have to do is hit play and listen to it from beginning to the end. I like every song on this one.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I've seen the movie and Love It! Purchased this as a gift for my daughter. Bring on the tissues, please!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Really well written ...it just seems disjointed until the end. After Kite Runner, nothing could be as good, so it maybe should be a 5 star, but an excellent read
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A fantastic digital version of the game. I tried to play Magic years ago but no one in my hometown liked it or heard of it. Now I can play online vs people that enjoy this game! Best part, I can show my son this game!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was great, not a scary part in it! Was able to watch it with my 6 year old without fear of nightmares, and also had tons of adult humor! Can't wait to see the second!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved this book and totally puts life as we know it into prospective. I'm a much happier person for reading it.<br />Thank you Anita for sharing your absolutely amazing story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it is challenging enough to Keep my attention but not too tough as to where I completely give up on a game. I also like that they make it so I'm not constantly having to buy hints. If I can't figure out it, I feel confident I can come back later and get it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book keeps you thinking that Grey can be tamed.  In &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray' all Grey wants to do is beat Ana, and now he still wants it but resists.
B00338QENI|4.0|Ms. Skloot did an incredible job of reporting this sad and remarkable story. Fairness seems to be at the heart of it, and she gives us little reassurance that the world will likely be a fairer place any time soon.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Several people at book group recommended this and they were right, thoroughly entertaining, laughed out loud and wished it didn't have to end.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Cary Grant is a wonderful actor.  Story line is good and clean without the content of current movies of today.  One can just relax and enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved loved loved this book, but I'm dying to find out what is going to happen next with Eva and Gideon! I have read all 3 books 2 times and they are just as good as reading them the first time! Sylvia Day, you keep me wanting more and I love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun and challening! if u use the cheats app beware of the adware. all in all a good app worth getting.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another very good book by Rick Riordan.  Interesting and Funny.  Good for any age.<br /><br />&#34;Team Leo&#34; all the way.<br /><br />Andrew
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a very playable game. Most games like this you go to your base, collect money and xp and wait 12 hours to play again. In this one you build units to battle other players and you can lose an hour in this game very easily. Nice job.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|Not a fan of books jumping around so much but thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Took a while to tie everything in but it worked.  Would definitely try another book by Nesbo.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love item delivered on time packaging good too, was able to contact seller and have seller shorten shipping time as well really appreciate speedy replies great
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I can't even play the game says type a name and I typed like 100 names and it won't work.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It started off a little slow but definitely got better.  My husband and I wanted to watch it so we could see Despicible Me 2.  We feel well prepared.  I was a cute story.
0679805273|5.0|This was the theme of our baby shower and we had cupcakes made to match the rainbow stripes.  After the event, the book was given as one of her gifts for the baby.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This was horrible, dull and slow. We could not finish  - watched just before he entered the Emerald City; then had to say uncle. Acting was uninspiring and the gal that played on the 70's show could not have been more lack luster. She looks great but brings nothing to the table. Don't bother.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is adequate, no  guide to tell you how to navigate through it.<br /><br />Works well with downloaded music from Amazon.<br /><br />Being able to purchase hard copy of CD and have MP3 instantly for the same price (or lower !) makes I-Tunes<br />far less superior!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Love item delivered on time packaging good too, was able to contact seller and have seller shorten shipping time as well really appreciate speedy replies great
B00CDT41RY|4.0|It was fun to watch, just sad this actually happened in the old days when blacks were slaves. I'm glad it is not like this
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Ah, Anne, giving hope to all of us late 20s spinsters. But let's be real, Captain Wentworth like Mr Darcy are men that can only be written by a woman. I like the subtle feminist digs in here too. Oh, Jane, the things you do to my heart.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Overall, it is a cute game and a great way to pass the time. Awesome for a rainy day. Its enough to keep you interested.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I immencely enjoy the science fiction, especially space and time travel, as well as ancient advanced technologies. However, I would prefer not to witness the intimate personal details of characters' romantic lives. It feels a bit voyeristic.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Pre-ordered Deluxe edition.<br /><br />Great job by Black Sabbath & Producer Rick Rubbin (Would not expect anything less !).<br /><br />It is hard to believe that these guys are still producing excellant Hard Rock after 40 plus years !!!!<br /><br />I was listing to these dudes when I was 12, and now some 38 years later I can enjoy more new music from them.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great movie, but had to drop it a star for two reasons. One, needs more Hulk smashing things. Loved the part when he reveals how he \\"controls\\" it. Second, Captain America is really the only true hero due to his heart and attitude of self-sacrifice. So, I didn't like hearing egotistical, self-serving Tony Stark constantly putting him down. Its the little things, really.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|i did not like the game/the game was to easy to play/would not recomend it to anyone/waset that fun to play
B003EY7JH6|5.0|Typical Asimov - spine-tingling thriller that is a real page turner. Where are the robots?<br />And oldie but a goodie. GET IT!!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|A really good app with one glitch.  The glitch is as follows.  GENERALLY puzzles process in difficulty to 288 pieces.  However in some instances puzzles only process to 56 pieces.  I attempted to contact developer to get exploration, without success.  Otherwise I really enjoy this product.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Great case.  Very solid and well constructed.  It's slim, sleek and highly protective. Comes in a variety of colors.  I highly recommend!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What can you say? Jon is a real ham and a whole lot of fun to watch. You love him, you hate him, you despise him, you envy him. It's a roller coaster of emotions and actions. A great ensemble of characters and actors makes for a pleasurable and, at times, insightful peek into the many doors and windows of the ever-changing 60s.Plop plop, fizz, fizz!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Good movie, action from start to finish. Good way to start the avengers franchise.  Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of comic books

HarperCollins. 2013. 697 + xxxii pp, illus., maps, notes, index. $29.99.<br /><br />In the space of the months --Emmerson's book in March and Collins's in May-- we have two exceptional works of history, appealing to both scholars and lay readers, that mount a serious critique of popular interpretations of the origins of World War I. Both, directly rather than obliquely, are critiques of the popular (and outstanding) works of Barbara Tuchman -Emmerson takes on her The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914 (1966) and Clark the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Guns of August (1962).<br /><br />Both are substantial works, by historians who are exceptionally widely read. They write like angles and spread their nets wide to capture evidence and te3lling examples to support of their arguments. And both point in the same direction: that regardless of mounting world and regional tensions at the start of the 1910s, there was substantial reason to assume  that the tensions could be controlled, and if not completely controlled, that the result would simply be another of the regional conflicts that had become endemic from the late 1900s on.<br /><br />Emmerson's informative and charming book is a Baedecker tour of the world in 1913: not just what was the state of affairs and of mind in the world's capitals -London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Vienna and St. Petersburg--but in places like Winnipeg and Melbourne, Durban and Bombay, Tehran and Jerusalem, Peking and Shanghai and Tokyo. The result is a quite different picture of the world, not of one on the brink of ineluctable world war but a world going on with its business, with a reasonable hope of continued peace, and certainly not the world conflagration that was the First World War. (An example, in 12913, the three cousins -the Russian tsar, the German emperor and the British king--met in Berlin for the wedding of the Kaiser's daughter, princess Victoria Louise, and prince Ernst of August of Cumberland. \\"When great potentates who are near relatives can meet in public and give full rein to their natural affection,\\" opined the London newspaper, the Daily Graphic, \\"it is always legitimate to assume the political horizon is clear.\\")<br /><br />The message in Clark's magisterial history of the origins of the Great War, a book that will shape the contours of discussion for a generation to come, complements Emmerson's picture but is both more focused and more nuanced. In the introduction to his long and detailed account of what actually happened step by step and actor by actor, in the buildup to this tragic catastrophe, Clark argues that (1) the July Crisis if 1914, the month preceding actual war, was \\"the most complex [event] of modern times, perhaps of any time so far,\\" and (2) that it is best approached not by asking why it happened but rather how.<br /><br />\\"Questions of why and how are logically inseparable, but they lead us in different directions. The question of how invites us to look closely at the sequences of interactions that produced certain outcomes. By contrast, the question of why invited us to go in search of remote and categorical causes: imperialism, nationalism, armaments, alliances, high finance, ideas of national honour, the mechanics of mobilization,. The why approach brings a certain analytical clarity, but it also has a distorting effect, because it creates the illusion of a steadily building causal pressure; the factors pile up on top of each other pushing down on events; political actors become mere executors of forces long established and beyond their control.\\"<br /><br />This attention to questions of how rather than why leads to a step by step analysis of what actually happened in increments, not in bloc, and who the actors were and why they behaved\ as they did at each step. Along with that, Clark shows how attitudes changed during the two decades leading to the war, provoking a final break between old allies and invoking an acceptance of military means as the final, though not always desired, end to international confrontations.<br /><br />A book this detailed could be deathly boring but it isn't, not at all. This is a book filled with peoples -the story it tells is rife with agency--and Carlson (like Emmerson as well) writes a vigorous and engaging prose.<br /><br />Emmerson's is a very good book and a welcome addition to the literature of pre- and World War I. Clark's book should prove to be a classic. Both are great reading, not just for the scholar but for any enthusiast of good history writing.s were and why they behaved\ as they did at each step.

B003M6EAXM|5.0|This is my favorite series. I have a brother who spent well over thirty years in this line of work. Never a dull moment. I would compare it to HOMELAND with Clair Danes.  Another exciting,well written ,comparable series is THE AMERICANS with Kerri Russel. These shows are extremely factual in content, and that alone brings me back to watch them again and again. Pay attention and you will find some new fact each time you watch!!<br />coton

B00CFA222M|2.0|For all the money and time that went into the CG, you think they would have paid better attention to the narrative and editing.  But I guess prioritizing well developed characters and a well told story is old school in Hollywood.  Too bad.  It could have been a film I cared about.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Alice In Chains is one of my favorite bands. I love their previous album.  This one however is mediocre.  In fact it's the first average album this band has put out.  Every album previous has its own character and sound.  There are a few times when the album sounds like it is trying to push the envelope, but it never quite gets there.  Each song sounds very similar and overall the album lacks the terrific Jerry solos that we've come to enjoy.  If you love Alice In Chains get this album to complete your collection, but don't expect any of these songs to make a iTunes playlist anytime soon....
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|I can't believe that they are making yet another after this!  This movie is one of those movies that you watch and wonder if they filmed it first, then tried to come up with a story!  The main plot to the film seems to have been use the usual action movie cliches such as take a prisoner and be on the run throughout the film, bad guys shoot everything and everyone up but chose to beat up the heroes in order to give them a chance to escape, and lots of shooting and destruction!<br /><br />This film's main goal reminded me of 'Bad Boys II' in that the story was thrown out of the window in favor of crashing, shooting or blowing up everything in site.  I HATE when film producers do this and think that we should love it because they are destroying luxury vehicles.  In one scene, the armored truck was clearly intentionally destroy every car in it's path for no reason at all except the producer or director thought that it would be exciting.  I swear, whoever made this must have been a rich dude who knows nothing about film-making but wanted to be hands-on to act like he knows.<br /><br />The dialog and the pace of the film along with it's sleep inducing formula reminded me of 'The Hangover II' and it's lines that the audience assumes to be jokes - but they were not funny one bit and the timing was off!  There was not real relationship between father and son although they superficially tried to establish one, mainly because they felt that they had to.  In this Die Hard film, we do not care about any of the characters and we do not care if John McClean survived or got killed, just as long as the film was done.<br /><br />There comes a time when artists should know when to end something and when to continue them.  With the Marvel films, they came from comic books with over decades of stories, so they can keep making those.  When it comes to Die Hard, you have to end it when the main character is looking elderly with only the energy of a 35 year old.  The first three Die Hard films were great and classic, but the forth one was fair, and this one deserve a negative one in score.  This is one of those films that should not have been made.  They need to stop it now as the one classic series has gone the way of \\"Death Wish,\\" \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" with endless sequels, one more foolish than the last.  These are not James Bond films you know.<br /><br />Bruce Willis has had a string of flops that rank as some of the worst films ever made (\\"Cop Out\\" anyone?), and this Die hard adds to that collection.  This film is a combination of \\"I am Legend\\" for boredom with no build up or climax, \\"Bad Boys II\\" for lots of destruction without a plot, and \\"The Hangover II\\" for it's horrible jokes and horrible sequel.  I just don't understand (besides money grabs) how someone could view this garbage and green light this as a movie maker except in name recognition.  I waited for almost 40 minutes waiting for that 'moment' where I would become interested in the film, but it never came.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, like Stallone, is too old for this kind of thing.  They should both take cues from Russell Crowe and play more dramatic parts, but still be seen as a tough guy, only without the action.  Willis has done it before, although I am not sure Stallone could pull it off, but these senior citizen action heroes are the joke of Hollywood!  No one wants to see Barnaby Jones be invincible, and we are tired of John McClean always running into trouble and ending up the hero.  Three times was enough for us to accept, but five times (and a sixth on the way!) is beyond interesting!  Let it DIE!

B00C81LYH2|5.0|Even the youngest Barbie fans will be impressed with the beauty of the 2013 holiday doll.  Pure white elegance surrounds a very pretty Barbie.  I do not see much in educational value for Barbie and the durability of the doll is well known.  This is a collector piece and a great one to add to a collection.  I rate it five stars for it being a collectible toy.  For girls who want to play with Barbie by undressing her this is not the best choice.  For a Barbie tea party or wedding party this doll would be fun to play with.  I never objected to my young daughter playing with her fancy Barbies so I would buy this for a Barbie fan-young or old.  I think it is one of the prettiest holiday Barbie dolls.
B006QPX7UI|4.0|I liked it but a lot of what happened was left out.  Specifically, O'Rourke's role in the battle of Little Round Top.  He was really the hero of the day.

0385535147|4.0|Most agents and publishers would reject this novel out of hand for not having constant plot advances and setbacks. That would be their error since the book moves right along as a story being told by someone skilled in the art. At the end, Grisham explains accuracy and detail did not interfere with his writing. It shows, (jailhouse lawyers are laymen who know how to take advantage of regulatory and legal minutiae to accomplish their own ends; lawyers in prison are still called, lawyers)  but the story moves along nonetheless. For the cops and robbers reading the book, Grisham had to have talked to a few fed cons get to the lowdown on prison life, (example: 10 magazine limit) interrogation techniques, etc), but some of the misses were glaring enough to interrupt the flow of the prose.<br />JD Jackson (of Pelecanos - Derek Strange fame) did his usual good work. He has come a long way in the art of book narrating.<br /><br />Go buy the book and enjoy.

1594746036|4.0|Jacob Portman is a lonely teenager, surly and sarcastic with a cynical view of the world. With only one person to call a friend, his social life is nearly nonexistent. He spends his free time working in his rich uncles' drug store where he sabotages the displays in the hopes of getting fired. His mother is a chardonnay-drinking social climber and his father a floundering author with a stack of unpublished novels. Grandpa Portman is the one member of the family Jacob understands. Only he has yet to realize how deep their connection lies.<br /><br />When Jacob witnesses the fleshy eel-tongued monster who attacks his grandfather and leaves him for dead in the woods behind his house, he begins to suspect that the outrageous stories Grandpa Portman has told him over the years might very well be true. Jacob convinces his therapist and his parents that he must go to England to face his nightmares and find the monster who killed his grandfather. He stumbles into a time warp. It's September 1942 again and he finds himself in a home for peculiar children where he meets the kids from his grandfather's pictures.<br /><br />Riggs uses imaginative description and doctored photographs to bring his characters alive. \\"Emma Bloom, a spark, abandoned at a circus when her parents couldn't see her to one.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Let me start by saying that this has to be one of the most incredible and powerful pieces of musical theatre ever written. I personally feel like this film adaptation was nearly perfect in its portrayal of the musical. Even my boyfriend (NOT a theatre fan by any means) enjoyed the movie and he had every right to complain as I begged to go see it on his birthday.<br /><br />I wasn't the biggest fan of Russell Crowe's interpretation of Javert, but he did well enough. I also felt that the film poked a little TOO much fun at the Thenardiers...but I can overlook that as well. Everyone else I thought was simply phenomenal.<br /><br />If you didn't know this about the movie, the actors were recorded singing live during filming. If you have time, look up the special features and listen to the actors talk about how much it added to their performances. I think pre-recording the soundtrack is a major pitfall with musical movies, because it doesn't allow much freedom for acting in the moment. The actors had earpieces in place which played a piano accompaniment for them to sing with, and the full orchestration was added in afterward. It worked so very well and it was pleasing to know that I was paying to see actors actually singing and not being completely auto-tuned. My only complaint is that the movie seems to move much more quickly than the stage version, most likely because most movie-goers would have lost interest if it ran any longer. It's understandable, but I wish a few of the scenes had been given another minute or so to keep them from feeling rushed.<br /><br />The film was very true to the stage version, only turning a few soliloquies into spoken monologues, and also has a few nods to the novel that the stage version simply doesn't have the power to add. I'm almost halfway through reading the book and I am noticing plenty of details that were left out of the stage version that were included in the movie. LOVE it.<br /><br />As for the combo pack, I couldn't be happierthat this version includes Blu-ray, DVD, digital and UltraViolet!! Basically, I paid a few dollars extra and I can now play Les Misérables wherever and whenever I want, without worrying about format.<br /><br />Buy this copy now! You won't regret it.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a truly unusual book in the way the story is told. It's non-linear, but a sense of chronology does creep in and you can imagine what the War was like; through individuals' eyes and experiences. My sense of disbelief was suspended and I very nearly let myself imagine that a world full of flesh-eating zombies could happen. The author allows his interviewees to explain situations that I never could have thought of own my own. For example: I never thought of oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers with hoards of living dead prowling the depths like piranhas! [shivering at the thought]. This book is a good read ... Not a literary wonder - but fun and interesting. Now I understand why there's a current flux of televised shows about zombies. I guess vampires, zombies, werewolves, and the like will never really go away for good. Especially when a writer as good as this gives it to us a truly original story.

B00881VLCE|4.0|A really fun jigsaw puzzle app!  The only suggestion that I would make is that it would be helpful to be able to change the background color for the area where the puzzle pieces are located.  Sometimes the edges of the darker colored pieces get &#34;lost&#34; and are hard to see.  But overall a great app.

B005LAIIMG|3.0|The best thing that could be said about \\"World War Z\\" (the film) is also the worst thing: it's inoffensive. They have effectively homogenized zombies. Herein lies the major problem: zombies = horror. If you're making a zombie movie it should have some scary things in it. The average horror fan expects this. While many aspects of the film work the bland presentation speaks to the motivation of capitalizing on a popular trend and emasculating it to the point you can get the youngsters in without parents complaining.<br />The problems arise in trying to capitalize on a genre without really understanding it. In the theatre the final zombie confronting Brad Pitt was drawing derisive giggling. It was making facial expression similar to that of Ron Jeremy (those of you old enough to recognize the reference will understand the silliness) while making chattering noise similar to that of a dolphin \\"laughing\\".<br />Another problem was that the zombies were constantly falling. They were falling over edges, off roofs, over each other: no chance to send one sprawling was spared. A minor distraction comes in trying to anticipate what they're going to fall off next.<br />The best way to get a feel for what you're up against in \\"World War Z\\" is to take \\"28 Days Later\\" and drop it in a blender with \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\". One has to expect this, though, the film is rating PG-13 (which was probably their first mistake). A properly done zombie movie is not for the whole family. Hell, it's not for most adults.<br />They make a nodding concession by having one of the soldiers say, \\"You can put a few rounds in their chest to slow them down but the only thing that seems to work is to get them in the head\\". The problem is that they drop with shots to the chest. It seems the fear of ratings made the producers avoid explicitness you can find on primetime TV.<br />What saves the film is the pacing. It moves along keeping attention easily by presenting believable characters and not becoming complacent.<br />The best way to view this will be through \\"Pay Per View\\". The cost in the theatre was ridiculous for what was delivered. If I decided to go for the home copy it will be a year or two after release when it's lowered to the more appropriate price tag of $10.00. Anything else would leave me feeling exploited for a second time.<br />***Spoiler***<br />Part of the problem with homogenizing a genre is breaking the rules that makes it work. Brad Pitt finds a solution to the problem (not a cure) in the idea that the undead are trying to spread the infection. What ever side of the zombie debate you fall on (fast or slow, smart or stupid) nobody has dared to take the scare out of them by suggesting you can just inoculate against drawing their interest.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|Find instructions in the description of it on Google Play, or in the helpful reviews of others. Game play is mono toned without much variation though.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This has to be the best zombie themed app I have ever played, as you progress it gets increasingly difficult and does seem like a first person temple run with a lot more zombies and guns. Make sure to pay attention to your surroundings and not just the zombies in your way, also look out for the crows in the sky the mark a weapon location. I have to give this game a five out of five it's so much fun and addictive.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Arrived on time & in perfect condition. Extremely pleased! Fun addition to my Disney collection. I don't usually buy DVDs, but it's nice to have some classics on-hand.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|Really enjoyed this film. It's light entertainment....the sort of movie you watch once but some of the funniest lines stick with you. It could have been better if they had left out some of the cheap stuff that's not really funny, like one guy getting his arm cut off. Other than that, it's a good effort by Will Ferrell & company.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I really liked this movie. Just when you think he's down and out, he gets back up! Loved the ending too!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|This was just what I call a piece of fluff.  Really good to read when my mind is elsewhere and I need some distraction.  Enjoyable.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy using this app to help me to zone out and relax after a rough day at work. I have also found it to be very nice to fall asleep to.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. I am hooked. Sometimes you wonder what they are thinking but it is challenging<br />All in all a fun game to pass the time
B009R659L8|1.0|Sadly this book is not anywhere near MHC usual riveting storytelling. I had a hard time finishing it as I really didn't care who done it. The characters were boring, the story line amateurish and nothing like her writing of years past. Time to hang up the pen Ms. Clark. I will have to satisfy myself with reading one of your past brilliant stories. Very sad indeed.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great read!<br />Couldn't put the book down. I wanted to read it before I watched the movie. I highly recommend this book.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Absolutely kept me engaged and turning pages. Though I was dissappointed in the way the author ended it...almost felt insensitive.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|It was very lame, I tried it out first to see if it would be something that my grand children would like, way to boring.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Beautifully written, and fully of amazing images and a child-like searching for meaning and understanding in life. The two main characters and like star-crossed lovers, but operate with such veracity and spunk against their tyrannical relatives and mentors that it's a whole new ballgame. I loved this book, and it took me deeper than most books do.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|No one writes better romantic thrillers than Nicholas Sparks. His characters grab you, & make you want to know what is going to happen to them.  I saw the movie right after I read the book. I didn't like the changes they made.
B009EAO38C|5.0|You can't say enough about these guys. They're all musical prodigies and make beautiful music.  The composition of their covers make you second guess what the original artist was thinking
B007EE4XKI|1.0|Come on!  Once again, the promise of mathematics goes unfulfilled.  There are hardly any equations.  Why would they make a false promise?  Boo!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Like the original Google it is easy to use and common sense works when using it for the first time!
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every book Mary Higgins Clark has written! I have loved them all! She is truly the Master writer of Mysteries!
B0031RDV0A|5.0|Without doubt this book and The God Delusion have lifted a great weight of guilt and doubt from me.  Even as a very young and fearfully devout catholic something gnawed away at me.  The conflict, the hypocrisy and the &#34;reasonless&#34; reasons put forward by nuns and priests, all contributed to the doubt that made it easy to walk away from catholicism at 18.  Science did not even come into it at that stage!!  I did not know where I was walking to but it was obvious organised christianity had it wrong.<br /><br />Then after 40 years I read these two Dawkins books and knew my gut feelings and primitive logic were well founded.  Religious tribalism has been about the most destructive influence on mankind since our ancestors started walking upright.  What these two books did was provide the logic, facts and academic rigors that finally and fully supported how right I was to have those doubts as a small boy.<br /><br />Looks like I was the child of catholic parents and not a catholic child!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept you on edge all the time, wondering what was going to happen. The actors were brilliant. Story line was great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
0937381888|5.0|I have only been brewing for a couple of years. When I first got into it I discovered there were some books on the must read list. One of them was this book, \\"How To Brew\\". The other was the latest edition of \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\". I figured I would pick up the one first and the other if necessary. I leafed through both of them and thought the Palmer book looked more my speed, so I bought it. I never did buy the other one.<br /><br />It's not just a great book for beginners. I am currently reading it for the second time. I wanted to look at the material from the point of view of having made several good batches of beer. It's worth re-reading with this perspective. I am picking up things I glossed over during the first read. I have been doing partial mash recipes since I started. I am just getting into all grain and am taking a fresh stab at understanding the technical material in chapters 14, 15 and 16. This book conveys the necessary information at a level that will let a beginner go at his first brew with some confidence. The material is presented in a way that's easy to understand and the author shows a good sense of humor. It also has enough depth to be a useful resource for a moderately experienced homebrewer.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Now, this is some gangsta shit. One of the classics of all time.<br /><br />Joe's character is next level. Ray's performance seems to capture the real life action, times,
B00BTHV05M|4.0|What drew me to this band was the songwriters.  Not often do you find good lyrics, with the right about of poetry and style.  I am not a huge fan of One Republic, in that I don't like ALL their songs, but a few good ones stand out to me, and lately I have been listening to them over and over again.  Previously, my favorites from their other albums were \\"Marching On\\", \\"All We Are\\", \\"All Fall Down\\", and \\"Apologize\\".  The songs in Native are definitely \\"perkier\\", more up-beat and with lots of repetition.  My two favorites here were \\"Counting Stars\\" and \\"What You Wanted\\", both very different from my other favorites.  But in common with all of them were the quality of singing and the message in the words.  I enjoy the poetry and realism in the songs; it's great music.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a fun and challenging game.  had to walkthrough on last levels but it was still very entertaining to play.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|This book was a nice and easy read. It was quite enjoyable. The descriptions were smooth and the main character interesting.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Liked the ending.  Liked the deep thoughts and revelations of Enzo.  Lots to think about.<br />Will recommend the book to others.
B00005JPSM|5.0|its a very good movie  I told all my friends thay need to watch this movie<br /> I well be getting all my movies from  amazon from now on
B00BP29SAA|5.0|These Dr. Panda games are probably the best children's games I have found.  They have lots of activities to do, are practical and educational while still being fun for kids.  Well worth the small amount of money they cost.  Hours of entertainment!
B006OGMEUI|5.0|I'd been wanting to find more folk metal groups besides Mägo de Oz for sometime, when I came across Eluveitie on Amazon. And I've not been disappointed! I love the synchronous, harmonic, piercing, and gritty meld of a solid guitar base and a solid folk instrumental base (the violin, especially--see &#34;Havoc&#34;). The vocals range from lofty to screaming (wish the screaming would give way to something more like Pantera, but still good in their own right), meanwhile, and the songs' subject matter transports the listener to the epic, war-strewn days of yore. Bravo! \m/
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Now when I'm not near my laptop I can use this app to do college homework, listen to my music collection, or watch hulu.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This is the fourth of their series that I've read and the first book written in the series.  I like the chemistry between King and Maxwell and Baldacci tells a fast paced and suspenseful story.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Enjoyed this second book in the &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; series.  Did like the first book better although.  Started out kind of slow in the beginning, but quickly gained your attention.  Would definatly recommend reading &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; first, or else you may not understand the characters.  Have not read the third book, but plan too.
B0054SMID0|1.0|I think the heading says it all...Pedestrian and obvious plot, the film relies on closeups of MM instead of relying on his acting.. He cannot carry a film..at least in this case he didn't
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Pretty good movie that somewhat reminds me of how the old school horror flicks messed with your mind like the exorcist and the shining.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I just love this series.  What a great character Peter Falk portrays. The guest stars are terrific and the series plus the TV movies provide endless hours of wonderful entertainment. Any tv devotee that doesn't have this complete series in their video collection has to have their head examined.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|Cute game, my 2.5yr. old daughter loves it.  It was easy to pick-up for her after only one time of me showing her how to play.  Good graphics, and lots of activities to do.  Keeps her busy for quite awhile.  Love all the Dr. Panda games, they are all well worth the money.  While I did not like this game as as some of the others TribePlay has, I would recommend it!
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|Planet dinosaur is a very visually and scientific and historically accurate and beautifully made documentary on the most fascinating and terrifying and impressive dinosaurs that have ever lived in the Triassic, Jurassic and cretaceous time periods. It even has giant marine reptiles that swam in the oceans millions of years ago. You also learn of the different types and ancestors of meat eating dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex and where they lived. This show is full of wonder and amazing facts and information about dinosaurs.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Graphics are corny, some of the lines are corny, but it's a fun movie to watch with some friends and some fireworks.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|If you like really good music, like it use to be, you will love this album, and this tremendous singer, what a voice.
B007JVJ3C4|5.0|People have been calling this a sequel but its actually a reboot that just happens to star Nicolas Cage again and that's because the directors liked him in the first Ghost Rider Film.<br /><br />Let me just say I enjoyed the first attempt at ghost rider but felt it needed better villains and more action but overall I felt it was decently written film.<br /><br />Now Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance is not really well written but damn this ghost rider is much darker and the action is top notch.<br /><br />If you Enjoyed the First Ghost Rider Film Than You'll really Love This Reboot cause it amplifies all the action.<br /><br />My Grade for Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance Is a B+<br /><br />Great action<br /><br />Sicker looking Ghost Rider
B003VANOFY|1.0|Not much to say beyond the standards; lots of drop outs, replacements never worked right, never worked consistently.  Comfy, and good sound when I could keep it working.  The worst headset I've personally owned.
0143036742|5.0|Dear Ms. Lewycka:<br /><br />I realize that  A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian (though a key to your success as an author) is an old story to you and doubtless you have passed onto current projects, but having just read it, your book is new to me, leaving me surprisingly stirred up.<br /><br />I take issue with most people's view that it is amusing and humorous, as if that were your primary intent; I find the humor more as a camouflage to cloak the deeper issues of your story, in a more poignant interpretation. You see, I recognize a lot of my family history reflected in your chapters. Substitute Hungary for Ukraine, reverse the role of the father and mother and presto, you have my story, caught between the old and a new world, feeling a little uneasy in both. I too was born on the cusp of war/peace, during the last bombing raid, according to my mother.<br /><br />I am an author myself with 12 books on line and know that any story is a collaboration between the author and the reader. In fact I am writing this review mostly to crystallize my reactions to your book. I was hugely struck by Nadia's quest to understand  the hidden history of her parents, silenced by the fear of terror, the horrors of the way years and the struggles to achieve a new life in a new country. As her, I inherited my parent's cultural heritage, their hopes and anxieties, and your book made me conscious just how much. People like to think of a book as a pictures in words, but for me, Short History was more of a mirror. Thank you.<br /><br />Paul Telegdi a writer writing, reading...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is super fun and a great brain challenge! Forces you to think out of the box to solve the reach room. My reason for the 4 stars is that I'm hooked and have to wait for more levels, lol.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|Ghost Rider was a pretty well written movie. But there were some flaws with the script!<br /><br />Let me break it down for you.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />1. The villains were not well written in the film and didn't put up much of a fight and they get defeated super quick.<br /><br />2. there's hardly any good Ghost Rider Action.<br /><br />3. Sam Elliott's character was under used.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />1. The Story had Heart.<br /><br />2. Nicolas Cage was Great<br /><br />3. Good CGI<br /><br />My Grade for Ghost Rider is a B+<br /><br />Overall its a Fun Movie and I would recommend it to a friend.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|battery life is extremely short,I ordered extra batteries .how many batteries should I have for a short trip ? quality of pictures are perfect
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it! It keeps me entertain. I usually play before bedtime wish is not a good idea because I need to get my sleep.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is so well written. A must see by everyone. so unique, emotional. It is meant for all audiences. Truly a must see!!
B001CC7PKS|5.0|I saw DareDevil in theaters when it came out and enjoyed it even though it had problems. Then I watched a video with the director saying that the version that was released was not his choice it was a decision from the studio, Then a few years later the Directors Cut comes out. I just recently watch the Directors cut and wow it was so much better than the theatrical.<br /><br />Let me Break it down for you<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />1.Better Character Development<br />2.Better Action<br />3.Plot Holes Filled<br />4.Much Darker Tone<br /><br />The Bad<br />There is no bad in the director cut<br /><br />My Grade For the Directors Cut of DareDevil - A+<br /><br />If your going to buy DareDevil buy this version and be ready to be blown away.
B008KE3960|5.0|Best free game ever.  You can earn most everything by collecting gears. Buy the gear double and gear collector.  It's only $4 total for both but well worth it.
B002C949KE|3.0|Full review can be found here:<br />[...]<br /><br />...Dan Ariely is another public figure who has made a name for himself in the field of behavioral economics. The experiments that Ariely conducts and describes in \\"Predictably Irrational\\" are clever, thoughtful, and informative. If you like the genre, you will like this book. Yet despite all the nifty observations that Ariely presents, something feels missing. You know that sense that you get when something is wrong, but you just cannot place your finger on the reason? I struggled with this judgement about \\"Predictably Irrational\\" for a while. On one hand, all the ingredients are there for a great book, but on the other hand, why do I feel so unsatisfied? It is one thing to feel this way about a 3am trip to 7-Eleven, but I should not be so apathetic about a famous book. Eventually, it dawned on me: this book, like most other business/psychology/leadership books, lacks a narrative. The distinct experiments form chapters, and the individual chapters form a book, yet the emergent package ends up a collection of disjoint parts. This is a common problem of the \\"advice\\" genre books: when you create a book that revolves around a set of observations, it is difficult to twist these observations into a coherent story. Such story-telling is precisely where Malcolm Gladwell excels. Although Gladwell is a gifted writer in the first place, he structures his books into stories from which lessons in behavioral psychology emanate. This structure makes for far more interesting reading than a book of bullet points.<br /><br />I would have loved to see Dan Ariely co-author this book with Malcolm Gladwell. I am asking a lot of Ariely, I know - it is difficult to share the spotlight, particularly when you are a superstar in your own right. Yet as I write this, the Miami Heat are celebrating their second consecutive NBA championship, and Ariely would do well to learn from LeBron James and Dwayne Wade, and partner up with Malcolm Gladwell.<br /><br />Are Ariely and Gladwell that different from James and Wade? Yes, they are. Still, there is a clear illustration at work here of a win-win collective situation that results from selfless individual behavior. Just as LeBron James sacrificed a bigger payout (I know, \\"sacrifice\\" is a relative term when you are making millions) and Wade gave up his alpha dog role for the unifying goal of winning a championship, Ariely and Gladwell can form a behavioral psychology dream team. Until that happens, however, I am going to go read some fiction.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This product is a life saver. No need to keep a power cord with me when I'm out. Love it and have recommended it to many.
B000059HAI|5.0|This an excellently done movie. Fairly historical too. I don't normally like subtitles, this is an exception, but I also don't like non English speaking peoples speaking English with a  purported realistic accent.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|A must read.  You will not be able to put it down.  This could become real life someday so its very interesting
B0050DIWFC|5.0|While I am not normally a fan of courtroom fiction, I was completely absorbed by 'Defending Jacob.' I found the characters engaging and empathetic. The story was like peeling back the layers of an onion, every time I was convinced I knew how it would work out, i was faced with yet another twist.
B00B8WXEXO|5.0|great follow up cd! music with touches of Zepplin, etc added.<br />In fact read an article that Jimmy Page says they are the best new<br />band in America! If Page endorses you can't go wrong!!!
B000BCE918|5.0|This set of movies is well cast, directed and acted. The CGI creatures are superbly done. They are not just blood and guts, there is humor too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a lot of fun and cannot wait till more levels come out. The game wasn't too difficult or too easy. Really had a fun time.
B00466HM28|3.0|First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless. You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response. The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable. There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs. HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last. For this price it is a 'Do Not Recommend' for me.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I really think that making Oz a &#34;Ladies Man&#34; wasn't necessary...I think a different reasoning could've been used.<br />Just my opinion.
6305558167|5.0|This movie has it all. Sex, battles, romance, humor, pathos. The way Merlin is played is so out side of the normal acting and I love it!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love how the app shows how much % of battery I have left, like what they have on apple products. I also like how they show how good your battery is.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love this app it makes me laugh even when I'm sick. It is great for young kids to. Everyone should talk to Ben at least once. I totally recommended this to anyone who likes corny things.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Graphics are great, story is good.  To much time spent getting from one place to the other. Would definitely purchase the next installment.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the fact that it goes full screen and I can<br /> see all my calculations easily even without easily glasses!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Extremely fast and furious madness. Better on computer than on tablet, more control.  I don't think I  would play this if  I was only able to use a tablet
B009NQZVKG|5.0|EVERY ONE OF THESE NOVELS ARE UNIQUE.  PLAUSIBLE SCIENCE, HISTORICAL UNDERPINNINGS, AND HUMAN CHARACTERS THAT WE LOVE TO REVISIT OVER AND OVER.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is a great app I would get it the best thing is its free I'm rating this app because its good
B007IK44CK|5.0|I'm not a huge tom cruise fan since he got all crazy with the sciontology thing. This is a good action movie.
B00124LYHQ|4.0|Marking Brando is sexy and gives a great performance. Vivian Lee is excellent as Blanche. Great themes and characters as well.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|Awsome challenging game, its pretty intense, and i like the music choice. Works pretty well on my tablet. Dont know why the bad reviews, but ut lookd like ill keep playing this game for a while
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game app is by far the best game app I have! the variety of games is fair! very interesting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much more in depth than 100 floors, with a challenge and aha! moments. Some levels seem impossible but after looking at answers it was obvious.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before. I read the description and it seemed very original. We watched the movie with no pre-conceived notions. It turned out to be a real fun movie with some action and adventure. It was also a sweet love story. I would recommend it.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The photography was outstanding.  It was difficult at times to figure out the &#34;meaning&#34; of the script but after discussing it with others it began to make a little more sense.  It was a great discussion topic.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like the game but I hope it doesn't glich again.  I don't. want to looses. another one.  It took time getting to level 23. and now I have to start over.  I do like the game or I would never have played again.
0679805273|5.0|Great for graduation present.  Gave to all my students that were graduating this year.  they really really liked it alot
B008JFUO72|5.0|I have read these reviews and personally feel any bad reviews are not real avengers fans. I loved it and will recommed it to anyone. I also like the different angles writers have in taking these movies. I can not wait till part 4 and certainly hope these same actors are in it!! Thanks Iron Man and avengers!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is great but with only ten levels it does not last very long. I can't wait for more rooms to be added. It does present a bit of a challenge but not so much that you need help solving them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a real brain workout! Not overtly difficult but not easy as well. Definitely a must try and fun for all ages!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have Pinterest on my MacBook, on my iPod, on my Galaxy II AND on my Kindle!  I love it!  So many ideas and helpful hints, styles and gardening....the list goes on and on.  It has taken me away from Facebook!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Petty adicting game. It's very fun and I like how every room is unique and different. It definitely holds my attention. Which is the kind of game I like. It has just the right amount of challenge for me. of And best of all its FREE
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini is a great storyteller, who takes you in to the world she created with characters<br />you can't  help but love and yearn to understand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|keeps me busy on my trips when I just feel like relaxing!  Wonderful game.  You should try it, you'll ike it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Game is very fun and easy.  I do not bingo! Yet I still play on a daily basis.  My only concern is their customer service who said in an email they would get back to me within 48 hours and it has been 6 days.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|I've never gotten into FOB before, other than a few songs here and there. They've changed things up a bit with Save Rock and Roll. This is a seriously strong album with lots of uptempo numbers filled with big beats. The guitars are hard to find, but the vocals are good and many songs are catchy. Definitely worth owning.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I feel that the author has decided that his readers are not intelligent and don't have the ability to recall what has happened previously (3pages back).  I was so looking forward to this book and it fell very short of my expectations.<br />I am finding that more and more authors are falling into this trap.  We are quite capable of keeping track of what we have read.
B009CG29RK|5.0|I originally had no intention of ever seeing this movie until I saw previews for the second one. So glad I got this movie!!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie really kept the feel of the classic with a modern and updated style.  Wonderful movie I would tell the whole world to watch this one!
B00BGV0YD0|5.0|Is there really anything to cover here, I have a hard time deciding my favorite Doors record but this is always in consideration. One of my all time favorite album covers. I am biased though all of the Doors albums get five start ratings, they all have different meanings to me.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I can watch it over and over again.  It's hilarious and heartwarming.  Plus, the minions are incredible.  Despicable Me 2 was just as enjoyable.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Easy to get started with, but will take a while to master. Fun, time waster of an extreme sort. Glad to see a simple yet fun game for free.
B0060D123K|5.0|This has been my favorite Christmas movie as far back as I can remember, absolutely love it!  I watch it even when it's not Christmas to get a warm and fuzzy feeling.
B0085W09ME|4.0|We got to our destination, even through some cancellations on united airlines, but we go there within the same day
B000WEMH3C|5.0|So far it has held up well, we shall see once the colder weather comes in how long it lasts
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|A new and interesting look into the pre Pearl Harbor days. When our country was divided between those who favored assistance to Europe and those who believed isolationism was appropriate.<br />Worth the time!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|All the other reviews hit it right on the head.  CHALLENGING but not TOO hard.  My 7 year-old enjoys it as well.  Good on to have.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I own two Kindles, the original Kindle Fire and the new Kindle HD.  I have this game downloaded on both (it's slower on the original Kindle) and play as a guest on each so my grandsons can each create their own park (and they're too young to be on FB).  Being boys, they love dinosaurs so this game is right up their alley.  They are always so excited to feed their dinosaurs and collect the coins so they can expand and get more DNA.<br /><br />The downfall is how expensive it gets to expand, upgrade the harbors, research, and purchase the dinos, decorations, and buildings.  Thankfully they put the dino bucks and dinos on sale during holidays (which is how my grandsons both got the T-rex for which they've been begging) and at other times.  But it's also the main reason I don't build the underwater parks; the cost is WAY more than building the land park, so we're sticking with that for right now.<br /><br />Another feataure they love is being able to visit another park.  My one grandson does it all the time and he'd love to visit a different one every day if he could, but alas, it's the same park time after time.<br /><br />I don't mind spending some money to support a game, but I fear that as they continue to build their parks, it's going to be more costly.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is probably of my favorite all-time flicks. I have now watched twice and I recommend it to everyone in my life that mentions the word movie.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was  a good app.  It made u think to find the codes. But it need more levels to play
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|We were leafing through the available free movies and came across this one. We'd never seen it! Great acting... Gorey but good!!!
B0050XFYNA|4.0|Thought provoking film into the dynamics of step-brother relationships. Although their love and devotion to each other crossed over into a sexual relationship I wonder whether or not they were truly homosexual or heterosexual because the story line did not shed light on other sexual relationships.<br />Nonetheless a moving storyline about true devotion and love.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a great movie on the story of Linclon. Actors and actresses did an excellent job playing their characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short but intriguing....looking forward to the next chapter.  My 12 year old loves it! Give us more, with much higher difficulty.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's really really fun playing with my little 4 year old son he loves iron man. Funny flying around air we will be playing for a while.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I love the songs on this Cd they are songs you can listen to and get into and not get tired of.its a great workout Cd for me and makes me feel energetic. I am amazed constantly at the talentod Alicia Keys. I look forward to buying her other Cesar and hope they are just as good if not better.
B00CXL6XP0|3.0|From a music point of view, I can only confirm what others have already said: it's a great album. But the music is completely messed up by the dynamic range compression and the resulting distortion, especially in Where Dreams Go To Die and Spore is beyond anything acceptable. The audio simply sucks. I have noticed this both on the Spotify version as well as the CD version in the record store, which I therefore didn't buy. I'm amazed that hardly anyone is complaining about this.
B0037VNX44|3.0|Interesting movie, British perspective of the life of a brainless thug. Artistic and creative, not so accurate but nonetheless entertaining.
0786915749|2.0|The fundamental problem with this novel is that there are way too many characters to follow, and thus too little character development. There is Tanis the conflicted half-elf, Sturm the moody knight, Flint the crusty dwarf, Goldmoon and Riverwind the mysterious barbarian lovers, Tasslehoff the mischievous kender, Raistlin the cunning mage, and Caramon the burly warrior. That is way too many major characters, even in fantasy where ensemble casts are common. Much of the action is formulaic, as the authors try to set up the major conflicts for the following two books. Unfortunately, the title is the best part of this overly cliche effort.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I like the sonic screwdrivers! They are awesome! This one has the actual sound when you push the buttons and theend extends and retracts with a purplelight with a pen at the handle end. Downside is the pen part easily comes off ant the cap to but it comes with an extra replacement pen. The cover that goes over the button comes off easily to. But over all its a fun thing to play with and can get annoying with the constant whizzing of the sonic sound haha.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Any Dan Brown fan will enjoy this story. It has all the energy, suspense and intrigue we have come to expect from his writing.
0812550757|3.0|another great story, but you can see Card is starting to lose the thread of his original characters - weak ending.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!! My only complaint is that it completely takes Too long for the next book.  This one seemed to have dragged just a bit, But the story is still Great & you just Can't get Enough!!! please don't make me wait too long this time!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I was surprised by this movie.  I didn't expect much but it was very good.  It was a little predictable but still a must see.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Fun game that does not rely on in game purchases to enjoy.  I will enjoy playing it some more.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
0812550706|4.0|Card does a great job on this one - old style sci fi.  If you like Heinlein, Asimov  and Bradbury, you'll like this.
B004WPYO4C|5.0|From an AV stand point, this disc presents a beautiful version of the film. Not overly digital, with a fine level of film grain preserved.<br /><br />As for the film itself. Better people then me have extolled its virtues. Suffice to say. Get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend told me I would enjoy Downton Abbey, but she didn't realize that my husband and I would sit glued night after night while we went through three seasons.  Finished Season 3 last night, and my husband is upset that we will have to wait until January for the new season to start.  Really well done....solid performances by all....engaging plots and story lines.  All in all, 5 starts hands down!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it - the puzzles were challenging enough and not basic or obvious. Looking forward to more levels. I recommend it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game I really enjoyed it...not too easy not too hard. I would definitely recommend it to pple who like puzzles and problem solving
B000LTAY1U|2.0|It is nearly impossibe to pull the stem out to change the time or the calander settings.  I have to use a long nose pliers to pull it out and then sometimes I pull the stem all the way out of the watch.<br /><br />And i dont think it keeps very good time
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Among the best romance novels I've read. I loved that there was actually done substance to the plot and characters.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I plan to read the whole series of books by Gabaldon.  I read it on my Kindle at night before going to bed, and I am off in another world . . . an escape, a historical look (probably with liberties) into Scotland in the 1700's, main characters so well described that you feel you know them and wonder what they are going to do next.  The theme is a little 'out there', but that's what makes it different than other recent fiction.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is so addictive!  I'm constantly trying to get a batter score.  My 3 year old grandson plays it and watching him got me hooked.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|The wife and I both enjoy a good scary movie and we both found this movie very enjoyable to watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was fantastic! The characters were all well written, and each with multiple layers that made them engaging. Can't wait to read more by Hugh Howey.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I did love this.  Years ago my husband and I saw it live at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta.  I have read the book three times, and my bucket list just may have room for one more version of the movie or another stage play!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I just wish it was even longer...I wasn't ready to be finished!  This is my first G5 game...it won't be my last. On to the next one!
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|This series is a little slow at first but after the second episode is really picked up.  I can hardly wait for the next season,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it! it's a world you can learn about taking care of your own horse(s)  and enter them in competitions! I just can't put it down!
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|I don't watch the series on TV, but one of our daughters does and she wanted to see the original PSYCHO to see where the series originated.  I also wanted to see it again, and I am 69 and because of this movie am JUST in the last few years able to take a shower without someone else in the house!  It affected so many like JAWS and going into the water at the beach.  This original Psycho was so 'mild' compared to movies today and even things on TV.  That was interesting to my daughter and myself.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just a great read. Doesn't smother you with action, but allows the reader to see the development of the characters.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Everthing I thought it would be...Loved the story and especially the ending.  I think the older generation can appreciate it more than younger ones.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|For an action adventure film it was surprisingly funny. It is great fun for the whole family. Black Widow is hott!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|what a great movie to watch on the big TV plenty of action will watch it over and over again 5 star
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game only has nine levels for you to complete.  It states that more levels will be coming later, but never states when later will be.  One or two of the objectives are challenging the rest were easy to figure out. I had no difficulty installing or running the game as others stated.  I was playing it on a Kindle Fire HD.
B00A2LFXVI|4.0|Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 leaves off, continuing Frank Miller's epic tale of a Batman returning to duty after years of absence. This time Batman must deal with a Gotham police force that wants him arrested, The Joker newly roused after seeing Batman's return, and even Superman. The action is brutal and intense, perhaps even more so than the first part, and the commentary on political and social matters is just as much a part of this part as it was in the first.<br /><br />If you've seen the first part, I shouldn't even have to sell you on this one. Just watch it. And if you haven't go watch that one first, and then this one. These are serious Batman tales, that made so many insightful predictions that are frighteningly accurate to our modern age, and address serious issues of morality and justice. That and there's some serious ass-kicking. Well worth the watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an Excellent book!!!!! Very creatively written. I could not put it down. I keep hoping for another chapter.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|To best appreciate this movie, see Before Sunrise (the previous movie in the series) first.  It's a wonderful continuing love story told by articulate characters who communicate deeply.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I got this book for my wife (who is reading the whole series).  While she liked this book, she felt it was more drawn out, and less interesting than others in the series.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|&#34;Les Miserables&#34; is, first and foremost, Victor Hugo's tragic tale of one man's lifelong quest for redemption. Jean Valjean, having served 19 years hard labor for breaking the law in France around the time of the revolution, is a bitter and hardened man. But a series of events in his life turn him towards God, and on the path of redemption. He continues to do good deeds, even while pursued by lawman Javert.<br /><br />This movie, being an adaptation of the popular musical, manages to stay the closest to Hugo's original novel of any movie or musical adaptation I have ever heard of, and that is a good thing. The musical is also known for its amazing music, which has all been translated over as well. Some have been critical of the music aspect, saying that it isn't the &#34;pretty&#34; music, as it is all recorded live while acting (rather than dubbed in later), and that some of the actors are not very good singers. I admit to not having an expert's ear for music, but I found the music as wonderful as any rendition I have heard, if not more so. Perhaps it is not as &#34;pretty&#34;, but it feels far more passionate, and real when performed this way. I find myself relating to these characters more than I ever have before for this &#34;uglification&#34; of the music, and thus I believe it is all the better for it.<br /><br />Aside from musical purist snobs, or those who simply hate musicals, I have a hard time imagining why anyone would not enjoy this film. It is well worth it, even if only once, for the experience alone. I am glad that so many people can now enjoy both this story and this music now that this movie musical has been made.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|FAIR WARNING: This review contains some MAJOR spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie, read with caution!<br /><br />Reading through the reviews posted for Star Trek Into Darkness, they appear to fall into two camps: one (by far the largest) unadulterated love for the movie, the other (notably smaller) unadulterated hatred for the same movie.<br /><br />Question is, where does the truth lie? Is it \\"the movie of the year\\" or \\"absolute cr@p\\"?<br /><br />It's complicated.<br /><br />My wife thought it was terrific, but then again she thinks Chris Pine is hot and that was the major reason for seeing the movie (as with the original reboot in 2009). She thought the story made sense, the effects were awesome, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Her biggest quibble was that it appeared there was something weird with Chris Pine's lower lip, like he'd had collagen injections.<br /><br />If you're a long-time Trekkie (like me), it's a mix of love and hate. On the one hand, the effects are awesome. If you're a fan more of TOS than TNG, then you probably liked the 2009 reboot (as I did) because although different it does recapture the sense of fun and adventure that TOS had. And Into Darkness effectively continues what was started in the 2009 reboot. It's fun, its got a good, rousing adventure and it is spectacular to look at.<br /><br />But there are quibbles. First, why Khan? It could have been a completely new villain and the story been just as good. That's a minor quibble though compared to the bigger quibble. And that's the reversal of the death seen from Wrath of Khan (Kirk dies instead of Spock) and Zachary Quinto (as Spock) trying to outdo Shatner's \\"Khan\\" yell (also from Wrath of Khan). Couldn't they have come up with a different way rather than shameless stealing? So to me it ruined what otherwise was a rollicking fun ride.<br /><br />I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, because I am torn. For the most part, it was just as much fun as the 2009 reboot and I did enjoy it. But the theft of key scenes from Wrath of Khan (still, by far, the superior movie) forces me to lower it to 4 stars. Is it the movie of the year? No, in my opinion it is so far a tie between Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Into Darkness is a distant third. It's light years better than Hansel and Gretel (glad I waited to see that on a flight to Europe and even gladder that there were other movies I could watch when I quickly realized what drek that was) or A Good Day to Die Hard (wish I'd waited for the flight to see that!).
B0045XKJBI|5.0|.I can watch the twilight eclipse over and over its a seat gripping movie there's always something that I see more exciting than before I would recommend it to anyone who just want to relax ,get excited ,emotional ,or enjoy a day at the movies t. Twilight  Twlight eclipse
0739341243|5.0|Since I first learned the meaning of the word introvert, I knew I was one. I might not be completely introverted (there's a quiz in the book that proves as much), but I definitely am more introverted than extroverted. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain helped me to see myself in a different way. In the few weeks I listened to the audio version of this book, I realized why I do things certain ways, and that I'm not odd because of it. I am not antisocial. I am an introvert.<br /><br />Quiet is not a book about introverts taking over the world, and it doesn't bash extroverts. Rather, Quiet attempts to analyze the changing cultural tides that have shoved introversion aside, explore the leadership capabilities of introverts, pursue research on the underlying cause, if you will, of introversion, and discuss ways in which to thrive as an introvert in a seemingly extroverted world. With plenty of science and real-life examples, Quiet is a thought-provoking, well-researched, timely compilation. I'd call it pivotal. To the scientific community? I have no idea. To my life as an introvert? Yes.<br /><br />Glances at Asian culture, elite schools, and even evangelical churches make Quiet an interesting study in introversion. Also, I enjoyed Cain's analysis of America's cultural shift from the importance of character to the importance of popularity. I highly recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I shouldn't even have to say much here. If you heard the music from the movie, you should know whether or not you would like this music. Some have critiqued it for not being &#34;pretty&#34; enough in the movie, but I found the performances to be more believable, and more passionate than many other renditions. Still, to each his own, and those in love with the original musical recordings may not care for these as much.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this is only &#34;highlights&#34;, although it does a pretty good job getting most of the major pieces onto one disc, and keeping it from being bogged down by the entire script of the film. The one truly odd omission is &#34;Do You Hear The People Sing?&#34;, although there is a reprise of it at the end of &#34;Epilogue&#34;. If you want a more inclusive soundtrack, that is now also available as a different product.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The history of the facts in the film made it very enjoyable to me.  Great actors and acting was exhibited
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful escape into the past, the characters capture the culture, humanity and one's imagination leaving one wanting to know what is going to happen next.  I easily give this series five stars.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is fantastic and made for sci-fiction lovers. Excellent storylines and really well done. The actors and actresses were well thought out and fit perfectly into the show. Can't wait for more episodes!
B005LAII8A|4.0|&#34;Looper&#34; almost passed completely under my radar. I am so glad it did not do so. At it's heart, it's a time travel movie with an interesting take on the concept. However, it is so much more than that.<br /><br />Joe is a Looper, an assassin hired by the mob to kill people they send back in time. You see, time travel is possible - in the future at least - but also illegal. So the mob uses it for one purpose: to kill people, and dispose of them in the past. Loopers do this killing, until the day their contract is closed by their own future self being sent back and killed - by their own younger self. When Joe's future self comes back and escapes, there is a race for young Joe to &#34;close the loop&#34; and the mob to catch both Joes. But old Joe is a man with a mission, a mission that goes beyond mere survival...<br /><br />The film ends up becoming about far more than time travel, as a mystery begins to unfold, hard choices are made, and a genuine moral dilemma appears. The story does not go where you expect it to, and even at the end you may not be entirely sure what young Joe is going to do, when he begins to put it all together. A great sci-fi movie, well worth checking out.
B005LJJESY|4.0|The Green Lantern was a good superhero movie. I cannot say it is as good as Superman or the new Batman movies, but it has it's place amongst superhero movies. Although it may deviate from the original, but that is the general trend lately...to explore different viewpoints and aspects of superheroes.<br /><br />It has great action scenes and decent special effects. In terms of going into depth of the protagonist, it is a little lacking, but if there are subsequent movies, it may be a good starting point.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Read the book to with my 9 year old son.  He absolutely loved it as did I.  Dahl's story is compelling.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Had a great time playing. More than just a hidden object game.  It was very challenging but not frustrating.  Good story
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved everything about this book. I would recommend it to all my friends. I loved how the book would take unexpected turns. I wasn't able to put this book down after I started. This book made me feel like I was a part of it and i loved every second of it. I hope Kiera makes this trilogy into a movie! I love love love love love this book!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had heard this title for many years but knew very little about the \\"real story\\".  It is a fabulous story on so many levels.  I recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it was fun at first then got boring because it was too easy and you have to do the easy ones to get to the harder ones and then I think, but don't know for sure, they want to charge you for the app. Right now it is a mindless activity suitable for a wait in  a doctor's waiting room. My grandson has it and was doing it while waiting for a flight at the airport, so maybe that's what its good for, mindless waiting.
B005I19TYY|3.0|Newsflash:  for quite some time now, law school enrollments have been half female.  The world of law is no longer one in which the women are secretaries and paralegals and the REAL PLAYERS are all men.  (Yes, I know there are a couple of token non-white non-male attorneys.)  I can't be the only person who knows this, or the only one who is sick and tired of women continuing to be back-benched.<br /><br />And, of course, it just might have been a more interesting show, as well as a more realistic one, if there had been active, intelligent, non-eye-candy women who were among the principal players.
0316223239|4.0|I really enjoyed Room, I will address some of the points of other reviewers, are some parts tedious? Yes. Does Jack the five year old's narrative get annoying at times? yes, sometimes.  Do I wish the character Old Nick, was described more? No, I think it would have ruined Jack's innocence if brought up more.<br /><br />But if that hold you up, then you are missing a great novel with an excellent character study.  This novel could have went super dark and we could have known every horrible thing Old Nick did to Ma, instead of just hearing the mattress squeaks, and the arguments that Jack picks up.  I like it cause this book is about maintaining innocence under the worst situation possible, it's about a hope of normalcy.  and it's also about motherhood and maintaining stability.<br /><br />The main thing this book did was make me think if I was in that situation what would I do, and how could I do it.<br /><br />This novel isn't for everyone I enjoyed cause it made me think, one of my girls just turned six so it made that much closer to home.  I would recommend this for a child Psychology major or someone in Psychology.  and for people that want a little more out of reading and to think about what you would do in certain situations.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and free!  challenging, but not so difficult that you will get stuck and give up.  levels seem to get more challenging the more you complete.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I found temple run 1 got too hard and this is even harder so i haven't really bothered with it. My grandkids also complained about the difficulty
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games where you have to manipulate the environment to solve the mystery!  Cannot wait for the next chapter.
B002SR2PKG|1.0|....but after 70 something pages, I just simply gave up. The first time I attempted to read this book I was in the 9th grade and my older sister had asked my neighbor if she could borrow It from him. Keep in mind, he's a hardcore stoner, so he must have been high when he read this book. Or he just doesn't know  good literature. Either way, he was wrong when he said this book was good. So anyway, back to the past. My older sister never got around to reading It so I decided to read the book. I stopped reading it the same day I started it. I felt it was too boring and it took a million years to get to a good part. I'm not like most people, if I don't like a book I'm not gonna finish it. Seriously, I'll pitch a boring book so fast it'll make your head spin and I'll still be smiling at the end of the day. Okay fast forward three years. I buy a Kindle Fire and one of the first books I purchase on it is The Shining (which was absolutely amazing, by the way). A few months later I decide to purchase It, Carrie, and Thinner. I don't know why I did that, I guess I figured I was too immature in 9th grade to understand a good book. To make a long story short, I ended up deleting all three books. Thinner and Carrie, because I knew after reading them once I wasn't going to read them again so it would just be a waste for them to be there. And, It, because my opinion still remains the same. It's boring, it's takes a million years to get to a good part, etc.... I stopped reading after 70 something pages. This is just my opinion, I didn't like It at all (at least what I was able to stomach before throwing in the towel). And, honestly I don't see how so many others liked it. But to each his own, I guess. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is so stupid I didn't get far enough into it to get to the group orgy part. That's a good thing, because that's just wrong. 11 year olds, seriously?
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I am a mother of a teen, so I like to read what the kids are reading to get a sense of the material and theme.  I got hooked on Percy Jackson, now loving this Egyptian theme on heros.  Write some grown up books with the same adventure, would sell!
1781162646|4.0|Although I don't think there could be an equal to the gun slinger series this is a classic King thriller. It has all the components. To the reviewers who have complained about this not being issued as an e book, look at it this way. There are items you don't buy at Walmart, there are foods you don't eat off paper plates and there are books that are meant to be read on paper. You lay a Stephen King book on a table, or night stand or desk and that cover without even opening the book gives your brain a glimpse of whats inside and you know it is going to be a good ride.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Watching Downton Abbey really transports you back in time to the period where masters and servants thrived. The costumes, scenery, architecture and lifestyles are mesmerizing. It's fascinating to know that the Downton house is a real building in England not just a studio set. The many different characters on the show keep you intrigued and wanting to watch the next episode. It's great to have all the seasons available on Amazon Prime at the click of your fingers. Enjoy watching.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Beautiful Hawaiian music. A coupke of the songs lime Auwe are sung in the traditional method. I highly recommend this cd
B0053TMP24|5.0|As always, engaging and fun adventures.  Love going on quest with Percy?  Mom of teen who got hooked on Percy Jackson story.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|works great, fast and fan is quiet. haven't tried the on board gpu. i use it for gaming and it works well with my radeon hd 6670.
B00005JKNF|1.0|The sound worked ONLY as far as the screen with the option to select PLAY, VIEW SELECTED SCENES, etc.  When PLAY was selected, the sound disappeared.  I forwarded, and found the problem persisted throughout.  I confirmed that the issue was NOT related to my PLAYER, as I was able to enjoy other movies, without difficulty.<br /><br />Had hoped to enjoy Gosford Park over the 4th Holiday, but, it clearly wasn't to be.  Very disappointing, indeed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive but lots of fun.  I enjoy having to have levels to complete.  It would be helpful to earn dozer dollars by resetting puzzle s.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|Got it at a great price and love the show. Great if you like sci-fi. Action and humor are both included.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good story line, fast reading.  Especially liked the narration style of the main character.  Don't want to give away the content.  Read it!  You will enjoy.
0156027321|2.0|I realize I'm in the minority here, but I just didn't like it. I found it tedious and dragging on and on. I thought the ending was kind of sick and it really didn't shock me, which I guess was the intent. Not my taste.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I loved the movie!  My son (age 15) and daughter (age 10) enjoyed the movie & the meaning behind it.  Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome and very entertaining it is great to own and you should get it. By far the best Gama.  have downloaded so far.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I saw her perform on Dancing with the Stars and I found her CD right away!  I listen to it all the time!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|Tom Selleck's acting is always good. The character, Jesse Stone, is great at finding culprits and setting them up to catch themselves.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I enjoy reading this book and find myself not wanting to put it down. The reason for the 4 stars is that the chapters are very long and are about one person in the book, by the time I get to the next chapter, I have forgotten who is who (my own memory issue, not the writers.)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best series I've read in quite some time. Fell in love with the characters and loved watching the story progress
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I love this movie and the fact that I found it on Amazon for a good price made me so happy!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|George Martin is a fantastic author, and I commend the various techniques he uses such as extremely elaborate imagery to make the reader feel as if he/she is right there, watching all of the events fold. That's part of what I admire about him the most. However, I feel at this point, he's stretching the plot too much. He's introducing so many new twists and characters, and the sense of things begin to get muddled around. Oh, there's someone vying to get to the Iron Throne through Daenarys? Let's add 3 more plots and characters who are trying to do the same thing with entirely different adventures!<br /><br />As much as I continue to enjoy this series, I can't help but shake the feeling that Mr. Martin is simply taking up pages. I wish he would make the plots more focused and concise rather than randomly introducing an entirely new POV and then killing that character in the same chapter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had not watched the movie or heard much about the story line, when I read this series of books. I really enjoyed all three books and could not put them down; I couldn't wait to see what happened next! It demanded and kept my full attention and had my imagination working overtime. I would highly recommend this book, but would suggest you start with the 1st book, or you will not have many big pieces of the story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is awesome especially if you love horses and if you have kids, my daughter loves this game she can't put it down!!!
B00004STDN|5.0|I loved this movie and I was even more happy when I got it and it was a special edition with more features!  I love watching special features!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Perfect for a free game. Very entertaining and Challenging ......This is a great game to get your mind thinking. Sss
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the entire series and want the writer to keep this saga going.......the books kept me wanting to read and I found myself thinking about the book at work, not wanting to wait until I get home to read more. Come on, give me another one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book and series so much and I have read all of the books at least three times !
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I did not like the writing, and words were far overused and repeated. Though the story is easy to tell where it's going, the initial idea was \\"unique\\". Not bad for smut.
0062255657|5.0|Very easy read. Has Lovecraft qualities, but is distinctly Gaiman all the way. I love the voices given to the characters. Most of all I like the perspectives: Gaiman is &#34;just trying to give us what we want.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I wasn't crazy about this app, I ended up removing it. I didn't like the look or layout and decided to just add FB to my favorites, for quick access. I wish FB would come up with an app, but rumor has it, they have no intention of doing so....too bad.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|Paul Newmans best. You will love him the same ways his Bunk mates did by the end of the film. Unforgettable
1848566980|5.0|Having grown up marveling at Foss' artwork, but never knowing until much later who the genius was who made these great images I let a lot of OMNI issues and other works get lost or sold off. This volume put's a lot of that material in one fantastic place.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|I bought this for a topper on a cupcake stand; but rather gave it to the bride to be as a put-together.  She will find a use for it.<br />It would also make a good table activity at the reception.  Two sets in a basket would occupy that age group of children that don't want to be there.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Definitely a book I would read again. I can't wait for the next crossfire novel! Not a ton of action in this one, but lots of Gideon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its fun if you really love animals its great from my Kindle Fire HD and keeps me busy when i to mush time on my hands
B0000000LI|5.0|I had this CD for a long time and &#34;my dog ate it&#34; really. So I was happy to be able to replace it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. Makes a great social commentary that relates to issues we as a society face today. Way more detail than the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 1, 2 and 3 just get better and better.  Yeah for the English.  The humor dry but absolutely funny.  Love Grandmama.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very interesting and keeps you thinking! Even my daughter found it good fun and was able to get some clues that I missed.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is really fun. My son and I enjoy playing this game together. I think it is a great family game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was so fun, but wasn't too challenging. I finished in a few hours. On some I had to really think but others, not so much.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This thing is easy to set up, provided you have an air compressor or electric air pump. The inflatable toys are a nice addition, and the kids (2yr, 4yr, and 5yr old) loved the whole thing. The water fountains are a great feature, but unfortunately the slide is not slippery even with water flowing over it. Glad it held up to the kids rough play did not lose any air. Well priced, I would recommend this to others.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Short, sweet, deep and thoughtful. A great story for all ages. Lots of wisdom within the pages. Highly recommended novel
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my kindle fire and it is PERFECT for toting around to the gymand other spots. Others were much too heavy and bulky - this one perfect!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It was awesome at first but then lowered the price after I got it and it takes a lot of memory if you have a lot of apps and are running out of room so yeah
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|hilariously funny and cute!!! Entertaining and wholesome!!! I love this movie so of course I had to purchase it from Amazon!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Gru destroys the dreams of a father and son. And then robs three little girls the chance of an adoption by a real family. All the while keeping slaves (minions) and the elderly and disabled locked away in the basement.<br /><br />Truly a despicable man.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Loved the story.  The acting and the directing were top notch.  If you like a movie with strong characters and a story, vs. random explosions and violent crime, this is a great one.
B002WCLG48|5.0|This is a film for all HALO fan. It tells the tale of HALO and how all this happened. Awesome
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the search for clues,also like that you have to use your brain to figure a way out. Can't wait to get stuck again.
B005CRPB0U|3.0|Too few stories. Surely after writing so many Harry Potter pages the author could come up with more tales to actually make up a small book's worth. Not worth the price.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good little game, but quickly loses it's challenge.  Future boards need to become a little knew complex. It kept my attention though  and played it till I beat it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was a great follow up to Beautiful Creatures.  The first half was slow, but the second half was fast paced and satisfying.  There was better development of supporting characters, which was good, at times I care about them more the main characters.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Virtual city playground is the best way to about building your city and for people who real how they spend their money
B007STBUIW|5.0|Great great summer movie.  I needed an upgrade from the VCR tape that I had. I never get tired of looking at it!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Entertaining and imaginative! Sandbox mode is cool because you can practice creating any object you want. Make more levels, please!
1400097029|5.0|Author has an exceptional grasp of the English language. A joy to read his description of both landscape and interior thoughts.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|If you like adventure for the whole family, then you will enjoy this movie... just sit back and enjoy a classic!
B001XV09UG|3.0|It's a good movie but I am not a Nicole Kidman fan.  I think she is awful.  But everyone else and the premise is very good.  Worth watching
B006LSZECO|3.0|I\\"m on page 296 of 415 pages and can't wait for it to end.  It would have been a good book at maybe 300 pages, but it definitely did not need to be 415 pages.  Just my two cents worth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I didn't think this game would end up being so fun... I made so many points indicating for this horse! Great app and lots of fun.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My daughter, who is 6, and I absolutely love this movie. We have watched it a few times now. Too cute!!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I thought it had a strange ending for the season, but what was to be, was to be. added this to my collection
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery App is fantastic...works great for my Kindle Fire HD.  Love the images, and it is so easy to use.  Tells me exactly how my Fire battery is working!
0399162097|2.0|This was the first book I paid for in almost 7 years that I didn't finish.  I got to thirty percent and I was done.  I got so tired of it and have no desire to finish it.  I'm sorry I lost my money on it.  Hope everyone else enjoys it.  Each to his own.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|I love, love, love these episodes.  The actors are outstanding, and the plots keep you interested.<br /><br />I, anxiously, await Season 4.  Although, I hope one my favorites returns.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|this is a great show.I added this to my collection. mathew fox is great. I wish the show had lasted longer.
B0086213XW|2.0|The movie had some interesting parts.  I like the theme that sometimes just changing your surroundings doesn't change who you are or your level of happiness.<br />However, I thought the baby talk between Seth Rogan and Michelle Williams was ridiculous and annoying.  There was a lot of unnecessary nudity and sex; it was there to be there, but didn't really move the plot along.<br />I'm glad I watched it for free, because I would have been terribly disappointed it I had paid to see it.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I look forward to hearing the author at Tennessee's Early childhood Summit later this month.  He is an excellent participant in what we might call&#34; school reform&#34; but I consider this a wake up call to  all those interested in our future.  Many of the families we work with in Head Start produce children who do succeed, despite great challenges that most of my friends have never  seen.  Tough is a natural story teller who is not afraid to discuss his life and his own family. A really smart guy who cares about children who need the care of a system that does not simply toss out those with challenges. We have to do better, and Tough gives us some ideas.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Unless your life if perfect, I recommend reading this book.  It outlines and details the road to perfection.  Thank you James.
1781162646|5.0|This had that same melancholy but lovely yearning for a simpler time gone by, only this was better written.  A wonderful read.  It is not particulary deep, but it captures a sense of time and place, so you feel you are there.  I think these sort of stories owe a lot to Ray Bradbury, especially his \\"Something wicked this way comes.\\"  The difference is that King adds sex to his stories, not that there is anything wrong with that.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe Bonamassa has amazing guitar skills that he uses to sing the  blues.  His performance at Beacon Theatre is mesmerizing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After typing that header I am not sure who is the villain if this book. Amy is truly brilliant in her skill of manipulating the people around her. I found myself skipping to her entries as they were better than her husband's. He becomes what he is because of Amy he claims, but there is a rottenness in him that was there from the beginning.<br /><br />The end was a total flop, leaving us hanging with no resolution and no clear winner.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is your typical solitaire game you know and love. The ads are not intrusive at all.  They pop up in between deals.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game had  a good mixture of puzzles and hidden object sites. It was easy enough to figure out your next s tree so without being so easy that you felt cheated.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|The beginning of this book was too slow and drawn out and the ending was cut too short and wrapped up too quickly with too many loose ends still hanging about.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|We enjoyed the characters and the story line of this light comedy.  I would recommend if you like these actors and we are looking forward to the next &#34;Reds&#34;.
0871403633|4.0|.Thought provocative explanations of the origins of the various features making up the &#34;human condition&#34; of modern man. Difficult fo the non-scientific mine to fully comprehend.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Discs were very clean and package appeared to be new.  Movie is great anyway, awesome plot with mystery, thrill, and action.
1885167776|5.0|Bought the book because I read some of the higher rated reviews and some of the lower rated views. I wanted to be fair and objective, but will tell you up front that it started out solid and ended solid. Good info. Good quotes. It appealed to my anecdotal memory and so from a non-scientific empirical review of the material...I really liked this book. May read it again, now that the author has hit me upside the head and gave me a better reason to focus. That would be time well spent. Thanks Mr. Keller. Good stuff!
1597801577|4.0|This book is incredibly well researched and the amount of time and thought that has obviously gone into the world-building is truly awe-inspiring.  The writing is generally good from the perspective that there is an amazing and complex story which is communicated well and clearly without a lot of pure exposition.  This is even more impressive given that the story comes with a strong warning about our own, not-so-distant, dystopian future of environmental collapse and corporate government.  Paired with the story's morality play sense of right and wrong, this could get preachy but doesn't.<br /><br />The book is set after the rise and subsequent fall of globalism, in a time when international trade is really just rebuilding itself.  The Kingdom of Thailand sits as a rare, independent nation amidst a sea of global warming collapsed environment and gene warfare induced famines and diseases.  And inside it, the Trade Ministry and the Environment Ministry are waging an idealogical war.  Is isolation, a weird form of 'nature-ism', and fear of the outside keeping the country safe?  Or do they need the mega-corporations' genetically modified grains to safely feed their people at the cost of being indebted to those mega-corps?  And just like the proverbial butterfly that sets off a hurricane, one illegal wind-up girl accidentally ignites the dynamite of change.<br /><br />Bacigalupi does so many things right -- the atmosphere, setting, dialog, completely unique story, etc. -- but he appears to lack trust in the reader.  It's true that he has a complex location and a complex cast of characters operating inside a very rich cultural environment.  Basic workings of the environment are often repeated to the point that it's difficult as a reader to get really engaged.  It is not until the last third of the book, where the action really picks up, that Bacigalupi appears to be too busy trying to get across everything that's happening that he forgets to keep re-explaining things and the reader's engagement is really achieved.<br /><br />Additionally, this book is rather poorly edited.  I read the hardback edition and there were a somewhat distracting number of simple typos (spelling, number or gender matching, extra words in a sentence that clearly should have been deleted).
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I just started playing but so far so good. I like the story line and the graphics are pretty good. The gameplay is very similar to other games in this genre (Kingdoms and Lords). You do a whole bunch of quests and then go battle.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|A great CD, I have enjoyed listening to it immensely, over and over again.  This is one of the gypsy king's best work in my opinion.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Lots of action and a little romance.  Is there no situation Jack can't escape!  Not to mention his math ability.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game requires thought and persistence.  I initially thought this would be a memory/matching game with a weak story line. This is not the case.  The clues have clues! A true puzzle. Hours of entertainment.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is for the people who didn't like 50 Shades. Great series but not as dirty as 50 Shades.  It had me in tears and laughing ,on the edge of my seat. Now i want the next one.(can't want for that one)
B0094CVO2S|3.0|From the samples it's clear the reinterprations do justice to the original recordings, but... really? Would you buy a greatest hits album of your favorite artist formed only by covers (unless you own his o her entire discography)? And before you think the analogy does not apply, remember: this is not classical music, there's an actual ORIGINAL version for every composition.<br />Good idea: make a single CD with the music of the trilogy.<br />Bad Idea: not using the original recordings.<br />If you think about it, you can make your own compilation buying every single Mp3 from the original albums...
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|If you can forget that you are no longer 6years old and you don't need Mommy to take you to make pee pee, you will love this movie. Otherwise, it's a snore fest
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it can get very puzzling but i would only recommend this game to people who love to solve puzzles and don't mind getting stumped.. c: enjoy the game it's one of my favourites
B009HCBCUE|5.0|This is an amazing snapshot of a record label (as each of these collections is) in the days just before the Beatles came and changed music forever. While there is some chaff here, by and large these are hits and regional favorites that have been remastered using masters of remarkable clarity and purity. If you are a fan of this time period in music, then you will love these collections. I've purchased several and have more in my cart. The quality and price can't be beat.
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|Been looking forward to this for a long time. Vocal & style wise Ozzy is not my fave but being this a Sabbath album, this was fairly what I was expecting. Once again, some great riffs from the great Tommy Iommi and this is a good, solid album. Like I said, not up there with the likes of \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"War Pigs\\" but still a good album from old timers. Rock on!!!
B001GXF2YY|5.0|For those of us lucky to ride Angels Flight every morning to work we are treated to a view of this book proudly displayed in the ticket booth as we exit the quaint cars en route to our gleaming offices towering over the 1900s station. And for all of us Connelly fans Michael once again delivers yet another enthralling story that hurls us back into Harry's life and world. As quaint as our daily ride is, Harry is hands down our favorite passenger - no matter what country you are visiting from. So for all of you who have not yet delved into this chapter of Harry's life, what in the world are you waiting for. It's a ride you won't forget.<br /><br />Thanks Michael for another great story - and for all of the wonderful new friends Harry has introduced me to.<br /><br />Now if my French was just a little bit better.....
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|this is not the best of the diehard movies but it has alot of action and explosions. the story could of been better with more history between father and son.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is a story that should be remember for a long time.  The actors did an excellent job of portraying things as they were to help us remember.
0425263924|4.0|Excellent book, written in the same tone as the first two in this series. Just when we thought this was to be the last in the Crossfire series, she trips us, (the readers) up again! Leading beautifully right into yet another book.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Hard to take it off repeat-- although nothing beats seeing them live. Thoughtful songs that stick in your head. Dad, Mom and 2 teen daughters are all enjoying this one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really love this app.  You can use any combination of sounds you want and you can save it too if you want that combination later.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked it so I am going to read the third book now..  Looking forward to the movies, wonder who will star.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Simply amazing. As a hopeless romantic this book feed every live stained bone in my body! Typical but ever so amazing
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked it.. couldn't believe the ending.  told all my friend to read it!!! hard to believe this kind of stuff happens
B004UO4AYE|5.0|If you want to learn the German language this book is awesome. I am German but have been in the states a long time, so there are times I use this book as a reference. You can learn German with this book. Good luck
B000000P17|4.0|good album really they killed the new york dolls version of &#34;human being&#34;and a pretty good cover of iggys raw power
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so cool you have to use your mind  a lot this is definetly a strategy game play it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Huts love it. Love the challenge and adventure of this fun game. Look forward to playing it more in the future.
B009QW7YEI|5.0|It's a good movie, one of my all time favorites. I had no problems downloading it, went very smoothly. It's definitely worth the price, and I would recommend it to others.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Wonderful and left wanting more.  Such vivid characters, alive and vibrant. Such love and romance. Diana Gabaldon is a master at making characters come alive.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I had bought this on 8 Track tape many years ago, and i played it until the coating came off of the tape. I finally<br />broke down and purchased it again on CD...Wow! does it ever sound great. I'm very well pleased...Rick
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Wake Up Darlings,<br /><br />James is here to tell you the good news.<br /><br />I get such a thrill every day around 2PM when James posts his daily blog. It is an absolute highlight of my day. I am hard pressed to disagree with anything he says. Which makes me suspicious, but there it is. Thank you James for helping me be less of a zombie robot addict every day.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|you can hardly get past normal mode. They're are red things and you cant get past them. And you hardly see your ship.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Read in a very brief time. Huge amount of good format information. Only the page number instructions may have been changed because on my Fire page number s are provided
B003VANOFY|3.0|This is a great quality headset in both sound and comfort.  Immediately upon putting this headset on I was happy with the sound quality and in that department it is probably the best headset I have ever had.<br /><br />With that said, this has also been the worst headset I have ever owned due to the problems it has with wireless interference.  Every 5 minutes or so this headset would drop signal and have to reconnect to the USB dongle and if you do much online gaming this can be very annoying.  I had the headset replaced (after less than a month owning it) by Logitech and the replacement headset did the same thing.  I even went through great pains to ensure no other wireless devices nor any other electronics were nearby so that I could hopefully use this headset without interruption but alas it did not work.  Others have had success with this headset though, so if you can purchase it from a place where it is easy to return I say go for it and give it a try.  But if you have to do an online return I would say don't bother!
B00513DGIO|5.0|Like reading Newton on Gravity. Like meeting Thoreau on the pond. Deep. Original.<br /><br />Everything I thought I knew about debt and money was muddle headed brainwashing. More religion than science. Thank you David for clearing my fog.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Finally magic on my kindle Fire, well made sealed deck feature is fun and allows for much wider variety in gameplay
B0014VPFTA|5.0|This album is so smooth and easy to listen to. I love it, you won't regret this purchase at all.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|App thinks that the video is completed at 11kb. I have updated, and reinstalled. This happens on multiple devices and has been happening at least a month.
B008OOYALE|4.0|IT keeps me occupied for awhile and entertained. I thoroughly enjoy this game although I have been unable unable to breed the tiger or diamond dragons.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|We already owned the standard Patton DVD.  The Patton Blu Ray is so much better - crisp shapes and brilliant colors. One of the best war films of all time.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you have only heard a few of her single you will adore this entire album. I  definitely recommend this if you like relaxing music that you can hmm to and chill with.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is like a file manager, I am able to view files and folders and work my way easily with Kindle Fire HD 7''.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a wonderful game that will keep you thinking for hours.  Had some problems with the touch screen but it still worked really well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool great fun for all ages the boards are the best gettin coins for more powerups and gettin new characters
6304712936|5.0|Fabulous music and great story!  Order the Directors Cut version for info on how casting was done and who had to be replaced at the very last minute.  This is a surprise in itself.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie truly draws you in from the beginning with the sights/sounds and the quick build up of the main characters - it shows the many faces of human nature and demonstrates that faith makes all things possible!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There really aren't enough words to describe the beauty of Downton Abbey. If you haven't seen the season finale, beware it's a doozy. After following this show religiously I never saw the twists and tunrs coming. Great writing and awesome acting.<br />This is why British TV is so addictive!
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I love Offspring but this album is the best I've ever heard, I listen to it several times a day and lyrics are fantastic too !
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Neat looking but the pen tip does not stay in anymore.  It may be from me carrying it in my pocket.  Love it, just wish it was made a little better.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I love it, but it makes me angry/sad/laugh. It's the most brilliantly written fictional show about the psychology of homicide I've ever seen, and I have watched a LOT of Criminal Minds. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone I know, but I'd definitely recommend it to several. Watch it if you think you can handle it, but maybe ask your BFF if you can, first. Handle it, that is, not permission. Live your life, you're an adult.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I already loved the actors in this film from their other films, but they were truly superb in this film!<br />Jennifer Larewnce is a gem. She definitey earned that Oscar. Bradley Cooper was awesome and convincing.<br />If you like rooting for the underdog kind of movies, Silver Linings Playbook is for you.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|This band is pure fun, almost psychedelic. They make you feel happy for the day. I listen to it in the morning in my car !
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Expertly written with important information, Dr Chapman has given a manual to all who want a solid marriage. This book will help identify solutions to existing problems and/or reasons for current success. Dr Chapman's work is truly an answer to prayer.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings started slow for me but so many images are now burned into my mind. I couldn't put the book down after the halfway point and still see so many of the wonderfully written scenes playing over and over in my imagination even now. A great start to what will be an amazing series.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Just like Detective Beckett I wasn't a big fan of Castle in the beginning. BUT that quicly changed. This show is quirky, fun and addictive. The cases are thought provoking and interesting. The characters are so well developed you almost feel like you've entered in the middle of their 'story.' Fair warning: this show is addictive.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Acting was fantastic, awesome story, feel good ending, relatable characters with real problems... Watch it, you won't be disappointed! Only downside was that I would've liked to see more of this story. It felt like a lot of good stuff was glossed over.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|What can I say ... it's Mumford & Sons. Saw them live and they're even better in person - each song is concert-worthy
B003YL4LYI|3.0|While this book was much like the rest, it just goes on and on. 5 books, about 5000 pages and still no end in sight. As long and drawn out as this has been, it is a great story in need of a conclusion!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is not just a tv show, it is definitely a way of life! If you haven't seen the Season ending, settle in & get ready...you won't be disappointed.
0316228532|1.0|Really disappointed. After the Potter series, I thought I was in for a fresh and thoroughly enjoyable read. However, I was introduced to a despicable and disgusting piece of literature. We need something that makes us feel good, not dirty and empty. If this was Rowling's 1st book, I would probably not read her again.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Absolutely love playing this game. It's fun relaxing and challenging plus you get to build up the village. A must have on my kindle.
1594484805|5.0|Inspirational and informative.  I think every leader, in title or in passion, should read this to better understand those that depend on them.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A great, little touchscreen for reviewing shots. Be aware that this will drain the camera's short battery life further. Prepare to buy an external battery charger like what I did when I traveled and used this throughout the whole day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game that you can make new friends and past the time. Very addictive once you start you don't want to stop.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is so fun. All members of my family have a Kindle however, we team up and play this one for fun and family time.  If you don't like laughter, cheering, and high fives for a good drive. This my not be for you!!! This game will fill your house with joyfully sounds!!!! Great game Thanks!!!
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie has so much truth to it...Walking West... When the Divine whispers a mission to you, we are to &#34;walk west.&#34;<br />This movie is too violent for me, but because Denzel is such a great actor and the message here is so incredible- it is worth watching...just close your eyes during the bloody scenes. Watch the whole movie and listen and watch carefully...until the very end. Then look at your own life....Are you being told to walk west with something? Are you doing so or have you been distracted?<br />Great acting from all in this too. And the messages are so true, &#34;We wasted what we kill for now.&#34; (something like that). This movie reminds us how fortunate we are...and perhaps, we will think twice before wasting what we are so fortunate to have. Perhaps we will start sacred activism such as helping to keep our foods pure and organic- helping to keep our waters clean, etc. Great movie!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I got the deluxe set and I couldn't be happier.  Sabbath is back!  This sounds much like those classic albums of the past and I can't get enough.  A must have for any fan.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Lots of fun and a good way to kill time. I would recommend this to all my friends. Try it out.
B00746TURW|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a good novel and I recommend it.<br />Great story. It's the kind of novel that you look forward<br />to returning to.
B003A8FESM|1.0|When I put the DVD in the recorder it did not work. The error sign kept appearing. This may have been a demo someone was selling. I believe I was duped on this purchase.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I charge this thing up and it last three days while keeping my Phone charged.  I also like the fact I can charge more than one device at a time.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This is a wonderful insight to life in Afghanistan by Khaled Hosseini who knows the country intimately.  His characters are absolutely believable and the book is written so well you cannot put it down.<br />I think it should rank with his masterpiece &#34;The Kite Flyers&#34; and anyone interested in what it was like to live in this country in turmoil will have to read.
B009R659L8|5.0|I ordered this for my wife and these are her words. the story content was &#34;very compelling.&#34; while reading, after each sitting, it left you feeling you needed to find out &#34;what happened&#34;, &#34;did the situation turn out as I expected&#34;, &#34;caught up in the speculation from the words I had just read.&#34;
B00005AWMF|5.0|Wonderful purchase, so glad I bought it. Any Sade lover's out there I recommend this CD. You won't be sorry.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Good product at the right price.  If you like this TV show, this set is definitely one to buy.  Priced right.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great graphics. Great action. Great game. Would be great to have more free levels. I am really enjoying this game.
0553386794|5.0|Seeing as how this book has a ton of 5 star reviews, I can't really add to much that hasn't been already said. Just plain awesome. Great characters (especially Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Robert Stark) great plot and amazing pace. I read the novel in just shy of three days. Looking forward to reading the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire books. One of the best books I have ever read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It is  both easy and difficult.  This could be a good game to help with observation skill.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I read this book before I came to South Korea to teach English. A must-read for anybody who cares about the world and its people. Writing is extremely well-done -- I couldn't put this book down.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Very dark, but that's ok.  I think AIC is one of the greatest bands of all time. Would highly recommend.
B000S9WLBY|5.0|Very interesting view about the japanese soldiers thinking of the war with the United States. It shows that not all the japanese agree or support the war.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Played as a guest and then decided to log in through Facebook and lost everything. No response from customer service so far. Joined the Facebook page and left a comment and then they blocked me. Giving them a couple of days and if no response going to delete.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I enjoyed the book a great deal. Tina does an amazing job at introducing her views on things without coming off as a self righteous shrew...see Bill O'Reilly. Loved it. Probably will read it again.
B0019M06JS|4.0|The songs are well picked and wonderful. My only criticism is that all of them have identical orchestral backgrounds. Just a guitar or trio behind some would give more variety.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Moss pens a scathing, timely peak into America's corporate food industry and the science that fuels it's strategies designed for profit at the tragic expense of health. Highly readable, the expose reveals deceptive marketing, governmental collusion, and often ignorant or uninformed consumer practices that have led to the epidemic of obesity and most other lifestyle (diet) disease or conditions.<br />  Read this book. Then spread the word to those you care about to read labels and stay informed about those lovely products in the aisles of the grocery store like their lives depended on it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and could not put it down.<br />interesting having the story told by 2 individuals with different view to the issues.
0802130208|3.0|I liked it up to the end. The concept of the story explains quite a bit as to why the world is the way it is.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Have listened to Pitbull for a long time and this cd did not disappoint.  It is well mixed and yes it sounds like Pitbull says &#34;dale&#34; too much, but that's part of his act.  A great compilation.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed the story and the twist at the end.  The book has likable characters and I didn't want to put it down.
0440246318|5.0|Hard to  put down Jack is back and I&#34;am glad he still 6 ft 5. This is  one of his better ones.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Uplifting account of a man rediscovering himself  thru an eight year journey of faith that he had no idea he was on until the end.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book first in third grade, and read it over and over. My copy is battered, a little torn, and well loved.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I don't like putting puzzles together, but this is fun. Can take your time and the kids love it too.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I rented this movie for it's all star cast.  Each actor, in their own right, could do no wrong in my book.  Never found a movie with Tom Hanks that I couldn't watch.  Add to that, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon as members of the cast, I thought for sure it was a winner.  How wrong I was!  It jumped from one century to another and a half hour into the film I had no idea what was going on or how anything fit together.  The costuming and makeup was extraordinary, but I found the movie un-watchable!  We turned it off and never finished watching it.  It was the worst money I ever spent on a movie rental.  No wonder I never heard of it!
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Matt demon at its best ! Great movie to sit around an enjoy don't forget the popcorn...or junk food !
B0045JEPXU|5.0|This was a great order with no flaws. It came early with no issues. I will order from this comapany again.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|I can  watch this at work on my kindle... too cool. The movie always had excellent streaming picture and sound
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good job at getting me away from the game in order to leave this review. I just wanna go back to the game now.
B0026QC0YU|5.0|I will defenetly recommend watching this movie it's how it all started in the mission impossible saga ,I own M:2 ,M:3 ,and protocol and sure enough need 2 re-purchase this one
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Disney/Marvel/Josh Whedon did an outstanding job with this movie.  It's a difficult task to tie in all the individual movies together to make one awesome masterpiece and Josh Whedon accomplished it.  The Hulk definitely stole the show.  I was surprised on how well Mark Ruffalo played the part of Banner/Hulk.  Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark/Iron Man.  I don't see how Marvel can ever replace him.
B005HSL626|4.0|I love the challenge and the wonderful graphics. It's format is easy but as the game progresses it's harder to win.
0425263924|1.0|I am not even 1/2 way through and I'm bored out of my mind!! It feels thrown together like 50 shades if grey which I hated by the end. Very disappointed
0061339202|5.0|this book shows clearly what is needed to activate the brain and increase Dopamine that make it possible to be truly happy
B0085YOD1A|2.0|have battery at opening of page.  Have to go to the colored battery - not able to see when on the page I am working on.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits a venti Starbucks without feeling like it's going to fall out, fits a 32oz Nalgene bottle too. Has a nice zippered pocket and fits my BOB perfectly.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is an unparalleled success for Joss Whedon, and we are the beneficiaries. Marvel's The Avengers excels at stressing the team aspect and flawlessly weaves a story line in which every team member is equally important and critical to overall success. Easily one of the best movies of 2012 and the picture quality and production of the Blu Ray is top notch.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very HILARIOUS and Awesome for all the details a funny concepts in this book. I gave it five stars because it might actually be my favorite diary of a wimpy kid book! I recommend it to every Diary of a wimpy kid fan in the world!
B004KKX814|1.0|The beyblade was broken, missing pieces, not painted. Was very disappointed and would not buy again. Don't buy from Japan!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is a bit too much on the gross factor but I'm still watching because of the great writing and character development. I can honestly say its one of the best shows on tv.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this mobile, packed it away for my next baby. Loved the little remote that comes with it, so convenient for those nights when mommy just can't get up again.  Put my baby to sleep every time. :)
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This is a very worthwhile read. It definitely speaks on a topic that is too widely ignored--suicide. It's very though provoking and (I hope) helps each reader to realize that the things they do matter and that every action truly does have a reaction. The smallest thing you do can affect someone in the biggest way.  This is a book for any audience, not just teens.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's a very fun game for those rainy nights when stuck in the house wth nothing to do. fun but not my faverite game.
0316247545|5.0|I apparently pre-ordered this and forgot so when it landed on my doorstep I was surprised. Once in hand I was going to suprise my daughter with it and so I opened it and took the bottom sky blue part off and held it up for my husband to see with our daughter next to him. Her eyes locked on it and she yelled, &#34;The Elements of Harmony!! Where did you get that, it is Twilight Sparkles!!&#34; As she is in the process of learning to read I was floored. It didn't have anything My little pony on the cover so it must look just like the one in the show. She hasn't put this down since i gave it to her weeks ago. I thought there could have been some more things about what they talk about in the show but if it makes her happy I am happy! Awesome book.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is worth the money especially with a hd kindle. I always know how much time I have left for reading,browsing, music or whatever else. Granted the kindle can display how much power is left but it's nice to know what you can do with that power.WM
B00513HXE2|3.0|I have to confess that over the last several decades, I've tried again and again to watch the newer Star Wars movies.  I've never been able to stomach more than a half an hour of any of them.  So, finally, I decided I'd try a book instead of a movie.  James Luceno's \\"Cloak of Deception\\" looked like a good place to start (and, it was).  I have to say that the book was better I expected it to be.  But, unfortunately, all I can say is that it was OK.  I had two major issues with it.  First, it's written without any real protagonist or even antagonist.  Oh, sure, the various characters are on different sides.  But, the book isn't really written from any of their points of view.  It's like the reader isn't part of the action.  Instead, we're hovering over it and looking in at it.  We never get any inner dialog into why anyone is doing anything, what they think about it, how they feel about it, etc..  All we get is what a third party observer gets.  The second major issue is that all the characters seem oblivious to the fact that they're being led around by their noses (and the nose-leading is blatantly obvious) through a whole series of events until we get very near the end.  In only a few cases does someone pause and think \\"gee, isn't that convenient\\" or \\"why would such a person do such a thing and leave such obvious evidence?\\"  Of course, until the end, they just blindly ignore those thoughts.  I'm guessing this selective blindness and the previously mentioned lack of inner dialog were supposed to combine to give me a surprise at the ending.  But, what was really happening and who was doing it was so painfully apparent for so long that the only surprise was that an author would actually write this way.  So, in the end, I have to rate the book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.  If you're looking for a place to start reading books in the Star Wars universe, this is a decent choice.  But, don't expect anything really good.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much! I wish there was a sequel! That it really shows you how people think ans how high school can be
0553801473|5.0|Overall Its worth 5 stars, but this comes with the frustrations of several dangling story lines that won't be continued until the next book in the series (possibly out in 2014).  Some story lines were enjoyable while others were difficult to accept. The story lines that I look forward to the most pertain to Arrya, Tyrion and Brienne.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Similar to the other video games they have put out for other systems. Less options and control than you want for deck building. So you always have more cards than you want...
B0058RCVYS|3.0|The movie started well but turned into a soap opera in the second half. The acting was very good. Half an hour too long. Editing was funny.<br /> I would still recommend it though.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun but it's challenges!! I like  it bc it gets me thinking outtside of the box and it gets u thinking of using things in different ways!!all I can say is get the app!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|when gus died i started crying so hard that i had to put the book down. i was surprised when it ended though.<br /><br />updated review:<br />i just finished reading this book for a second time and i have to say i fell even deeper in love with the story and the characters.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The Maggie Newberry series should be a great mystery series, but so far I am not impressed. Maggie Newberry learns that her niece in France has been kidnapped. Her parents send money to a man who phones them from France with information about the child and she jumps on a plane to find her, not knowing any French or any one in France. It all ended in back in America in someone's home with lots of bullets flying around. Very confusing.
B006RXQDH8|5.0|This is one of the best Tarantino movies and watching it in HD was a nice touch.  Great film with excellent cinematography!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great. I really enjoy how awesome it is hard to own a real horse in real life. I've nothing else to say about that really
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Another wonderful Nicholas Sparks movie. A wonderful story in a great setting with likeable characters<br />The cast and performances were terrific.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was an interesting game because of the puzzle aspect - you had to find objects in order to advance.  I liked it and the graphics were okay.
B00821OX98|5.0|There is a lot of potential here.<br />Lets see if the show will keep pushing the plot.<br />The main characters rock, Mason and Pope being the best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway serfers! I play it all the time. In the game you are running away from the police because you did some drawing on the side of a subway. It's fun and entertaining, it's for all ages!
B003F3FJQO|3.0|This book was really good in the beginning to middle. The ending didn't really want to make me read any more of the other books. But... I'll give it a try.
B0086700CM|4.0|The only gripe I had was there was no map or diagram of the course, or a way to slow the character down to get used to him.  It would be nice to have a speed selector and a diagram of the course.  He got killed way to easy... at least I got him killed off right away.  But the game has great graphics and is fun to play for a while till all that happens is the runner dies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed Season 3 as much as previous 2 seasons. Can't wait for Season 4 - just too long to wait!!
B007V4QK02|5.0|Shakira has set a permanent place in music performances with her unique approach to music performances.Great CD well done excellent
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app it's a good way to kill time. And it has a lot of unique equestrian features good time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|She loves the teen angst books and this one is right up that alley. Great story. Great characters. Buy it.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This sudoku is very challenging!!!!  I usually am pretty good solving these and find these to be a challenge.  I would recomend this to any one interested In .sudoku
B000IEXVCC|1.0|I watched this on television and can't believe two hours of my live were wasted by this pretentious trash.  I only kept watching to see if it could get any worse and it did.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Love the Russian theme and car chase scenes. Action packed and nice to see that Bruce's character made time to father children (lol) !!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to diminish boredom. Feels like you are really taking care of a horse. The beginning tutorial really helps you get a hold of the game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Liked the story line, although it's always a little sad when a marriage slowly fades. What these two people went thru was very believable.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I have been watching the die hard series for years and I loved them all- some we're better than others but this move was not believable! He went through his ordeal without a scratch! How can that happen? What annoyed me the most was that the character who plays his son hated him  just like his sister in a previous die hard movie! I don't care how much you dislike your parent you NEVER disrespect them buy calling them by their first name! After all John McClane did in stopping terrorism, he still gets no respect?!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I loved the look of the app and it made going on youtube a breeze, but after a clue of uses it wouldn't play visions or even co.e up at times. It is sad that this app doesn't work because if it did it would've been my favorite app.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony' s . And I mean love it. I have watched every episode. If you are a my little pony fan you will love this game. It's all about how Twilight Sparkels goes to Pony Vile, and has to save it from Nightmare Moon's (Princess Luna) darkness. You have to build building and buy ponys. If you are a parent looking for a good My Little Pony game for your boy or girl I say get it. If you just love My Little Pony than get it. Remember it's free. If they ever raise it to 99&cent; it's totally worth it. Now you know why you should get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|with breeding and unlimited worlds and enderman and redstone. if u dont buy this game....you will die!!!!! oryou will just be sorry and be injured a little.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I have said to myself to avoid gratuitous violence in movies because it can weaken the story and take away from your viewing experience BUT I liked this movie despite its emphasis on showing you the violence in slow moving graphic detail please spare any young children -this is for adults. I like the judge concept of being judge and jury it definitely saves time. Karl Urban did a good job. I was saddened by the persuasive poverty shown and the numerous violent acts committed every day because people are trying to survive- can this be mankind's future? See this for yourself and make your own decision but I want a sequel very soon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|In my opinion minecraft is the best game ever. The controls are super easy to learn and the fact that it doesn't take wifi,that's a big plus. It well worth the 7 dollars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good. I love it................ when I bought this iPad the first game that I installed was this one........because I love it solo much $$$$$#
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Better than the first one. Kept it pretty simple in terms of storyline so you can just enjoy the movie!
B007FXLWKW|3.0|I kind of expected it to be better from the ads. It isn't as good as Despicable Me. It reminded me of  Who framed Roger Rabbit? only without the fun plot. Kids might like it adults not so much.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Moderately entertaining, Cruise and the screenplay are not compelling (compared with the fabulous books that inspired the film).  Too bad - now they are stuck with Tom Cruise if they want to develop more of the Reacher stories.  Anybody over 5'5&#34; would be an improvement in this role.  :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|They need to add red stone and more decorations to give more detail to the game and some skins and texture packs.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Great movie and special effects.  Definitely an entertaining movie.  Story line was interesting and the visuals were beautiful.  However, loosely based on the book.  So if you are looking for a movie of the book, this will disappoint.  If you want an entertaining film and are not set on the book, this is for you.  I enjoyed it even with the excursions from the books.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I do a lot of gaming a video/photo editing and I'm very happy with it. Currently have this CPU running at 4.6Ghz with my H80i water cooling. Haven't tried pushing it harder than that since I'm fine with 1.2Ghz over stock. I also had a Thermaltake air cooler on it before water cooling that easily kept it decently cool at 4.4Ghz, but was in the way of installing more RAM.<br /><br />With my H80i cooler I see temperatures at idle around 28-30c typically and when doing CPU intensive work it hits mid 60's at that speed. Very stable as well and I haven't had one issue yet.<br /><br />Really there isn't a better overclockable CPU for gaming out there. Sure you could get a 3770k but it has no real gaming benefits as of yet.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love anything Andrea Bocelli does!  Great.I will continue to order his work. I listen when I want to have a relaxing moment.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a must have tool for reading important office works.  I use it frequently with things I have to do.  I highly recommend it for all.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|For writing this.I am required to write more words, but I fail to see the necessity of this banal requirement.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like this game and play it on facebook. Only problem with playing on my Kindle Fire is while trying to aim it will some time shoot the ball before I want to. TOO sensitive. Will recommend.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this charming book. Serious, funny, sad and lighthearted.  A good read for a summer's day or a winter's eve.
B00AMXXNBI|5.0|I would recommend this book to all those who love language, who are considering writing or who teach English.<br />Helpful and enlightening.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Pretty good and did keep me interested. Not the most surprising or in depth plot, but good none the less.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I got this because I had seen it years ago, and thought it was so funny.  It was one I could have probably just seen once, but I put it in my little DVD library.
0425263924|5.0|Please do NOT listen to the negative reviews of this book.....it was wonderful!!  The book explains why Gideon has his problems and shows you just how Eva and him work things out.  We should all be lucky to have a person who would do absolutely anything for you.<br /><br />I loved the book and look forward to the continued story of both Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />GREAT job Ms. Day!!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I love Michael Moore; he goes a little extreme...but his points are well taken!  I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because the graphics are amazing! You feel like you taking care. of the horse in real life.<br /> The only problem is that you don't get very many gems. Overall it is still a great game for everyone.
B00821OX98|4.0|I started this series when it first aired. I got side tracked and got back to it in season 2. I'm glad that prime has it. It's a good foundation for what's to come. It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow me like I wanted it to. Very impressed with the special effects. Not corny at all. A solid watch if you're looking for a sci fi.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  First impression was that it was a little old and outdated from the cover, however, once we watched it, we were engaged throughout the entire movie.  It was great.  It was fun seeing Tim Allen in a different type of movie, he is really a great star.  The grand kids were watching, and liked it just as much as we did.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I don't care what anyone says this movie was AWESOME!!! way better than the original! Hoping there is a Dredd 2!!!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This is an excellent desktop tripod for my iPhone. This is made of nice strong plastic that has a firm grip on the phone, easy to adjust for a great shot or for a talking head video. The cradle can be used on a regular tripod.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Unbelievable acting, and a creative and interesting plot.  Most of the suspense is left to the imagination, which I loved.  I went into this movie expecting a good sci-fi/action story, but it is so much more than that.  It's a fairly serious, and well acted, drama.  The most interesting part of the experience is watching a group of very talented young actors pretending to be untalented high school performers.<br /><br />Great movie!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is one of those books you wish was required reading and study in High School. This information is really life changing. I purchased additional copies and gave them away as gifts. I couldn't recommend this book enough, packed with real life information.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I heard about the book on NPR and I heard Ms.Kermsn on The Moth and I was anticipated liking this book. But I found Ms.Kerman am unsympathetic protagonist ... I could not get invested enough in her to care much about what happened to her, her description of life inside a women's prison was only interesting because of the subject matter but I wasn't drawn in.<br /><br />Maybe I felt a bit of resentment towards her consistent reminders that she was blond and pretty and that many of her fellow inmates were brown and less attractive than she, even when she described someone as beautiful it seemed to contain a modicum of surprise.<br /><br />I wish I liked the book better...
0425252868|4.0|Bought as a gift for my dad who served in the Korean War. He recommended it and enjoyed reading it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wow, it makes sense!  I can see why I don't feel loved at times and also why he doesn't.  The hardest part will be having him read the book.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book has more value for those who have been through a lot and those who have not been through enough. Sometimes this book can be a hard read so take it one chapter at a time in order to grasp the true meaning behind the words. Try catching him on Oprahs show too.<br /><br />An invaluable book that you will always reference back to.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderfully written book with similar themes to first two.  This one is more about family relations, how parents screw up there kids and visa versa. This within the historical tragedy which is Afghanistan.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game.  Some tricky parts. I would recommend it to someone who likes to think. A hints section would be helpful. An ok game.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Where do I begin , this movie changed the way I look at childhood legend like Santa Claus the Easter Bunny , The tooth fairy , the sandman and Jack Frost from jolly legends to superheroes , and that could Be one of the hardest tasks ever to do on film , and I salute this movie for doing that and more like the animation is dreamworks's bet yet and the story is super creative , second best Dreamworks movie ever.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game, it makes you think. You need to find objects then figure out how they will help you open the door to advance to the next level.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|9 and up can watch this , this movie scared the life out of me and my cousins , but we gave it another tach and it turned out to be amazing , it visuals and story are decent with a handful of characters that are great . Even though this movie is 9 and up , some 8 year old can watch this if they love scary movies. Good but not a kids movie .
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best first person shooter game on kindle and possibly the other mobile game markets GET THIS GAME ITS WORTH IT.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Out of all The animated movies of 2012 this is hands down the best of the best , also one of the best animated movies ever made , unlike video game movies it is not based on a video games , it uses video games as a creative world to really take advantage around to make a story , animation and characters be perfect .
B00915G6YE|5.0|Loved this season and just saw the first episode from Season 8.  It's a shame all good things come to an end.  Classic series.  Anticipating how the writers will end this.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good read different from other Hosseini books. I would recommend this book to other readers. Don't expect another Kite Runner.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|Not so good as some of his other albums as music goes, poorer selection  of rock and roll in his times, unfortunate his lost his voice, would have liked to hear his new albums if he still has his voice.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|It took me awhile to figure out why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the first two.  It had some great action scenes and special effects, but they were just not enough to rescue this sequel.  It was too depressing at times, and there were long, boring scenes where boy befriends superhero. I also just didn't buy the mad scientist turns soldiers into lava creatures bit. While you might be able to teach someone how to spontaneously combust, I don't think there is an off switch. I did enjoy the movie more the second time I watched it, but it is my least favorite of the three.  I saw the first Ironman because I was a Robert Downey, Jr fan, not a fan of Ironman the superhero.  I never really liked the comic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Ironman 2 was also very good, because the formula was the same.  This one was different. He lost his charm, his devil-may-care attitude and his aura of the invincible superhero. I think people who were already fans of Ironman the comic will appreciate it far more than just fans of Downey, Jr.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Shows Stevie Nicks, still has it. I love her great songs, hope she still sings 25 years from now. Her choice of songs is always right on.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I think I paid like $7 for this and it fits my stroller perfectly (Baby Jogger City Mini GT).  It folds up fine with the stroller as well.  Costs a ton less than the 'official' one for my stroller and does a fine job.  Love it!
B00000DFSK|5.0|great Album of songs some of their best recordings that will live with our generation for many years.to come, wish they were still making recordings.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Where as I have enjoyed the other two books . I found this book a chore to read. Just had way to many characters thus to many story lines going.

B009G7ZYPY|3.0|This women can truly sing  with a angels voice, but whom ever selected her song done her with a poor selection of songs for her to sing. Somewhat better songs with this album, but still can use more great selection of songs that fit her singing voice.
1400049628|5.0|My son liked the book so I bought another one for his friend and he also enjoyed the book.  They are both 12-13 years old.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|What a great collection of music from around the world, this music has to appeal to all generations, and people around the world. easy relaxing music to listen too.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, you can just hear & feel all the emotions from Rod in each song. This is a story of his life in song. So happy that I bought this CD. I thank Rod for making this for us.

B000002OMN|3.0|This album to me is out of at his time had it as far as music goes, a real king of rock and roll in his times, unfortunate his lost his voice, would have liked to hear his new albums if he still has his voice.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|this movie has always been a favorite of mine, gets into the irony of all the loss that we suffered as a country.
B0026P3G12|1.0|This women can truly sing  with a angels voice, but whom ever selected her song done her injustice with a poor selection of songs for her to sing. Greatly disappointed with this album.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Not a bad movie. Just really different focusing on the wizard using the same means Dorothy got to Oz in the first place.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Had to complete my set. I had the first season for years and never considered getting the rest until this year.
B0010TBQ0S|5.0|Outstanding performance by Geoffrey Rush throughout the film.  Love the selection of piano music.  Wonderful supporting cast.  A powerful message about a persons influence on another person.  I will watch the film over and over.

B006M4F67A|4.0|If you don't know what Mahjong is, get this app. It's fun and intuitive. If you are a seasoned veteran in Mahjong, this one is for you too. My girlfriend ended up playing it more than I did.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|Is not simple Don't buy not worth the points or money. Other apps are better  said would be last one you would need not true
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|10000000 was a game that I had heard a lot of hype about. Typically, I like to try out any game that has hype. Sometimes it's something I like, sometimes it isn't. In this case, it was a bust. I didn't enjoy the game. It seemed to be put together well, functionality was great, but just not something I would want to pick up and play.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book will give you a whole new respect for the armed services and all they do for our freedom.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I loved this movie. Saw it in theaters and had to add it to my Blu-ray collections. Came to me in great shape. Another great Quentin Tarantino film!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so fun and it makes you think. it kept me busy for a while and I cant wait for the new levels
B005LAII1C|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I love to go to goHastings for my movies and video games. I ordered the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet version from them, very excited as they had it decently priced and I trust them. I received just the blu-ray, and it was a rental copy in a rental box. When I called they informed me that in their description, &#34;previously viewed&#34; means it was a rental and they cannot guarantee what is included. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have been struggling to decide whether to take my business elsewhere or not. I asked if I could send it back and get the one I was hoping for and they refused.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really like the story of Eva and Gideon. This book ended so abruptly, there is no doubt there will be another book.. There has to be. I really didn't like the abrupt ending. There were way too many loose ends..
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It's a mixture of the Guitar Hero style game and any piano you play. You have to hit the key corresponding to the dot flowing down from the top of the screen. Fun to play, but lost interest after awhile.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is a pretty good spy flick with lots of action and surprise surprise, no curse words! Enjoyed this movie quite a bit.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I played this game when it first came out. I leveled everything up and thought damn, I wish this game was longer. I deleted it. Recently picked it back up hearing there were a lot of updates. Had to start from the freaking beginning! Not a problem though. Love this game. Very addicting. My only two complaints: When you get stuck upside down on a level in a bigger vehicle, you have to wait for your gas to deplete. There should be a sensor (somehow, if possible) to realize you aren't moving and are upside down that will end the wait. Also, when you do hit your head, after 3 seconds the game stops you. Sometimes the bike is still travelling or flipping, losing a few thousand points possible. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS DEVS (if you do read this)
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Finally got my hubby to watch it.  He enjoyed it enough that we went to see Despicable Me 2 that day!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A wonderful book about heaven that makes you want the key to get in! Jesus is the way truth and life, he who believes in him will never perish.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this story in so many ways! Neil has a way of creating wonderful characters you want to love and hate! It thrilled me.
0786958731|5.0|I just bought this for the minis which are great.  I need to try and get the kids to play this with me as they are starting to get interested in D&D - and this is a great entry level game.
B0086700CM|1.0|My daughter cannot get this game started.  She hasn't had problems with any of the other dozen games on the Kindle, so maybe this one is just for older kids.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|These two sound perfect together.  I bought their first CD too and didn't know if this new one could be as good.  It is.  I'd buy it again in a second.  Wish Joe would sing more with Beth on this one, he has developed a very cool tone that slides right up to her when he backs her.  If you two read this;  I'll be lookin for your third.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|My daughter doesn't like this game at all.  The only options are to find object, she thought it would be more like a maze trying to find your way out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  It keeps you occupied for hours just trying to figure out where to find little things to help you escape.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|My daughter loves this movie.  She loves the witches and the beautiful scenes.  There are a few scary scenes in the movie that may scare younger kinds.
1439152802|5.0|This is the second Kate Morton book I have read and I loved it. Good character development, story line and I felt I was living the book. Hard to put down.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is for younger kids.  My daughter did not like because it was geared for much younger kids than her.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|The story line was not credible at times.  Not my cup of tea.  Other readers may like it.  There was a lot of action on each page
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie just as I have all the movies based on Nicholas Sparks' books.  From reading some of the other reviews, that's probably because I never read the books.  Loved the action, romance, and twist at the end.  Great movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can't wait for more levels! Great app all around:) great thinking game and builds observation. You should download to play during free time!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|&#34;The Hard Way&#34; is the 4th Reacher novel I've read, in no particular order. This was the best I've read so far and I liked everyone of them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I sat and played this all day long. It is reminiscent of 100 floors, but I don't get discouraged and give up.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thanks Charlene Harris for writing this very entertaining series about vamps,weres,fairies and more.Sookie and friends always entertain and leave you waiting for more.
0240815807|5.0|For those trying to make quality recordings in a home studio, this book could save you a lot of time. Even though I have already produced some recordings for myself, I could have done much better and faster if I had read this first.  I am pretty sure that many home recording studio's could benefit more this $26 book than from more equipment.
1400052181|5.0|I'm really not sure what took my so long to read Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, but I'm thrilled that I finally have. For me this book married two of my most favorite things: biology and narrative (it is a true story, but it reads with the fluidity of a novel). Skloot traces the famous HeLa cells (\\"immortal\\" cells from patient Henrietta Lacks that have been used to study countless diseases and create many cures) back to their origins, investigating the treatment of the original patient and those connected to her since then. The research the cells have allowed has prompted developments as essential as the polio vaccine, cloning, and gene mapping- they've directly and indirectly saved many lives. The resounding ethical question: was it right for doctors to take her cells without permission?<br /><br />Structure<br />Skloot structures this text so that the reader is constantly being moved from Henrietta Lack's past to the author's investigation in the present. As we're finding out about Lacks and her illness, death, and the usage of her cells, we're also learning about her family and how the exploitation of her cells have impacted their lives. This book is an incredibly quick read, in part due to the overall flow.<br /><br />The three sections of the book are entitled \\"Life, \\"Death,\\" and \\"Immortality,\\" which parallel Lacks' existence. This process is also something that her surviving family members must deal with as well; coping with loss is difficult, but not being able to obtain true closure complicates matters even more.<br /><br />Narrative Style<br />I just spent a few minutes looking at the negative reviews of this book and was amused to see many say that Skloot has a \\"liberal agenda\\" and is \\"self-serving.\\" While you can absolutely detect liberal undertones (she does think that the family should be recognized, which would therefore be a stab at the pharmaceutical industry... ie big business), I thought she did an admirable job of leaving herself out of the text. We have no idea what her personal life is like, what she likes to do during her time off, or how devoting so much time impacted her finances (I often wondered). Skloot's tone is straightforward but dimpled with humor and wit. Her research efforts must be applauded as well. As Skloot begins to include Lack's daughter, Deborah, the book becomes a little more sentimental and personal, but without taking away from the overall purpose of the investigation.<br /><br />Ethics<br />The ethical implication behind Henrietta Lacks' story are incredible. She was a poor, black woman with STDs and cancer in the 1950s- there was absolutely no regard whatsoever for patient choice. Researchers took her cells and once it was determined that they rapidly replicated they were eventually sold to labs around the world, the Lacks family seeing none of the profit, adding to the dilemma. Race compounds the issue, Skloot adding in additional research on other controversial policies during the time period. While legislation offers more protection now, what does that mean for the Lacks family? Is it okay for doctors to make exceptions to help thousands of others and advance medical science? How should patients be compensated when their medical records are used and generate profit? And who pays whom? It's a really complicated, emotionally charged debate that's simultaneously fascinating and mind-boggling.<br /><br />Science<br />My biggest warning about this book- don't shy away from it because it so heavily deals with science. Skloot does a great job explaining everything from the basic structure of a cell, to replication, and sample contamination. I do think some diagrams would have added to the text as a whole, though.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br />I absolutely recommend this book- you will learn without feeling lectured. Besides being educational, it raises some great ethical questions (which is why so many book clubs have read it).erself out of the text.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|It started out easy and gets more difficult. It's a fun and challenging game. Great for killing some time.  :)
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|This is such a great album. The Neighbourhood is so unique in their sound and their music always puts me in a good mood. They are now my favorite new band.
6304696515|5.0|Glenn Close and John Malkovich at their very best.  I had to watch it more than once to really understand the plot line, but it is fantastic.  Great intrigue.  Great sex.  Great ending.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This was a good game...I'll have to look up more from this developer. I thought a few of the items/puzzles were a little difficult....thank goodness there was a 3  part walkthru on YouTube.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I only buy movies that I really really like.  Perfect setting in Paris, takes you to another time, a little fantasy in today's world.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|Because the movie was all mixed up...scenes out of order and made no sense AT ALL.  I complained and got no response from you people.  Made me even angrier because I was a darned good customer of yours.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This book was odd for me.  As I read it, I enjoyed reading it.  The style of writing flowed well, and I always looked forward to reading more.  I looked forward to figuring out what really happened in the main character's past that sent him over the edge.  But finally finding that out was so anticlimactic, and the ending left you almost right where you started.  Haven't seen the movie, but I'm thinking it just has to be better than the book.  I don't recommend wasting your money on this book.
0525952926|3.0|I haven't finished this book yet, but I am sure I will like it.  Ken Follet is a great author.
B004JK61K0|1.0|I got K-9 Mail because I couldn't get &#34;delete&#34; to work effectively on the Mail program that was standard on my Kindle Fire - everything kept re-appearing in my inbox.  At least I can delete from K-9 Mail's inbox, but that's ALL I can say good about it.  It isn't intuitive as the options menu must be accessed from opaque icons, and it limits messages to an arbitrary short length.  I won't use it again, but instead go to MyVerizon.com through the web.  There my options are clearly indicated, deleted messages stay deleted, and my outgoing messages aren't rudely cut off.
B004KKX814|5.0|Metal and heavy duty product! Would buy again! My son plays with these every day! All the kids play with them at school, and they loved his! Thank you!

B008220BLG|5.0|Warm Bodies is just a charming fun little zombie mythos fairy tale.  It can warm even an undead heart &#60;3
0786955570|5.0|As I said of &#34;The Legend of Drizzt&#34; this game is so much fun to play. If you want a game to spend hours playing, with friends or solo, then look no further
0062255657|5.0|Another smashing offering from Neil Gaiman!  While it retains his splendid urban fairy tale quality of story, this tale is a departure in that it is quite the emotional exploration with a young boy as a narrator and a cast of powerful females that are the true power behind the story unfolding.  The depth of the content will make me pick this book up again through out my life.
0786958731|5.0|It's a great game that is enjoyable with friends or solo. It is easy to pick up and is extremely addicting. If you are on the fence buy it and play it, it's worth it.

B000XUBC5E|4.0|Harlan Coben has you going in a half a dozen directions throughout his stories.  In the end all the threads are pulled together in a logical conclusion.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|This review is only for the eight-song The Fame Monster EP.<br /><br />I don't get why everyone thinks this EP was crafted by Jesus Christ. There are no 'amazing' or even 'great' songs. I'm not a Gaga hater, I own both The Fame Monster and Born This Way, but this EP is by far her worst release. Songs go from annoying and tuneless (\\"Dance In The Dark\\", \\"Telephone\\") to boring and nothing special (\\"Monster\\", \\"So Happy I Could Die\\"). I also dislike how pretentiously 'artistic' she tried to make us believe this EP/era was. Take away her annoying costumes and tacky music videos and you have generic, bland dance pop. The only saving grace of this release is \\"Alejandro\\", which is probably Gaga's best single.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Starts quick & never stops!  Keeps you guessing right through the last page!  Good character development  without bring tedious. Can wait for another
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I'm one of the few who thinks it's leagues above Teenage Dream, where she seemed to sell herself out a little bit. This album, although called \\"immature\\" by critics, is 100% Katy. She either wrote or co-wrote every track and even produced a bit on \\"Waking Up In Vegas\\". This album has no filler at all, I genuinely like every single song from \\"One of the Boys\\" to \\"Fingerprints\\". I wish this album would've gotten Teenage Dream's recognition, but I realize the pop-rock sound was a bit 2005ish and the songs weren't that suitable for radio. Overall, I'd recommend this album to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The starting levels are quite boring. As you proceed through the harder it can get addicting but I do not see much gratification.
B009KYXEY6|2.0|Lana Del Rey's debut album, Born To Die, was pretty good although most of the good material lied in the first half of the album and in the bonus tracks. In this re-release, she tries to recreate the magic she had in her first album, but it just falls flat. I do like \\"Cola\\", \\"American\\", and \\"Yayo\\", but the others are bland and passable, especially the first single \\"Ride\\", which is easily one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Here's to hoping she gives us another \\"Video Games\\" on her second album, which remains her best song.
0062255657|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Ocean at the End of the Lane.  It is at times horrific, magical and mundane.  It's very tightly plotted and moves along very fast. I think this will rank among his best works, it sounds like a memoir but it's not. Or is it....?
B00004X01U|4.0|This was one of the first Madonna albums I listened to and I think it's great. I really love \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"I Deserve It\\", and \\"Amazing\\". My only complaint is that it seems to be lacking in a central theme and sounds like a mixed bag. I wonder if her label forced her to record this album. I find the whole 'cowgirl' theme tacky especially since it doesn't really represent the album at all. Also, at only ten tracks, this would've been more appreciated as a side project instead of a full-blown era.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have been into these books for about 4 months and have finish them all in two weeks and can't stop read IT NOW
B000EGCITG|4.0|I've tried to like every P!nk album, but this is the only one I keep coming back to. It's very easy to listen to and the lyrics have enough depth to make you want to pay attention to them (obviously besides the lyrics in songs like \\"Cuz I Can\\", \\"Stupid Girls\\", and \\"U + Ur Hand\\"). The title track and \\"I Got Money Now\\" are my personal favorites. I highly doubt P!nk will ever top this if Funhouse and The Truth About Love are any indication. It gets four stars because of filler like \\"The One That Got Away\\" and \\"I Have Seen The Rain\\" (it's cute that she wanted to record a song with her dad, but it was unnecessary for the album).
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is great.  It is definately a challenge and there is strategy to each level.  I look forward to each new area I enter.
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|This album is much better than any release by Charli's contemporaries (Lana Del Rey, Azealia Banks, Marina & the Diamonds, etc.) Every track is fresh and interesting while still being pop. I think it's great that Charli doesn't categorize herself as 'indie' or 'alternative' but instead goes right to calling herself a pop artist and idolizing Britney Spears & Miley Cyrus. My favorites on this album are \\"Nuclear Seasons\\", \\"You (Ha Ha Ha)\\", \\"What I Like\\", \\"Cloud Aura\\", \\"How Can I\\", and \\"Lock You Up\\". I can't wait to see where she goes from here.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game offers levels of difficulties for beginners to the well advanced player.  Great variety and pleasant graphics are available too!
B000002NJS|3.0|I was excited to listen to this album because of all the hype and good things I'd heard about it. However, after listening to it, I felt underwhelmed, like a feeling of \\"that was it?\\" Most of the songs are unarguably boring, although I really do appreciate what she was trying to do, which is why I give it three stars. It's relaxing, which is a good thing, but a lot of the songs sound the same and it all just continuously drags on, making it hard to finish. The only songs I'd listen to again are \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Swim\\".
B002BI6SMI|4.0|what happened about a second movie but I didn't have to first find so I have to have the first one I heard that the first one was real good

B008K9SG9K|5.0|This was not my purchase but my 14 year old LOVES it.  She'd wanted it for quite some time and is thrilled with the music.
B00CDXOXB4|2.0|People who are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars, I beg of you, raise your standards!  First, let me say that Julianne Hough does a respectable job, especially for her lack of acting experience, and Duhamel is acceptable as well.  But, the move is incredibly slow until the last 30 minutes, the plot and details so unbelievable that I couldn't lose myself in the story, like a good movie should allow you to do.  The \\"twist\\" at the end just leaves you shaking your head, the perfect \\"last straw\\" for a movie that had too many implausible scenarios.  The implausibilities could have been so easily remedied but laziness appears to have been the order of the day when making this film.  This is NOT \\"The Notebook\\", by any stretch. The best thing about the movie is the little girl who plays Duhamel's daughter.  She's great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. It does make you think. The puzzles can be a bit hard but that's the fun of it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Havent watched it yet. Two toddlers do I can only watch when they are asleep. From the small bit I have seen it isn't snowflakes and bunny kisses. There is fighting and muscles and a big steaming bowl of violence. Good times
