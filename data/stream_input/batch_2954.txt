B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is my third novel by Hosseini. They are all great stories and seemed very authentic to the country of time frame. He makes me feel the passion in each character. I will read whatever he writes.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|great product great movie my best friend and her daughter thought it was wonderful. A feel good family movie yup
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|Jane Austin always manages to entertain with great insight and this novel is no exception to that rule.  Highly recommended reading.
B002ZM74Y6|1.0|Really disgusting sewer mouth script.  Joe Pesci is at his usual worst. Robert diNero should have passed this one.  As a &#34;true&#34; story, it could have been made with good clean language so the kids could see what a seamy life the mob lived, without having to cringe every third word. Even a 75 year old like me who has seen it all felt dirty after 15 minutes of continual bad words.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome becouse you can chat but it does not have every thing intel 8.0 update I just can not what for it
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie McGuire is one of my new favorite authors. After all of  my friends raved about reading  B.D I couldn't wait to read it for my self..and I am so glad I did..I'm extremely excited to start Book 2!
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Dune probably deserves 6 stars...I first read Dune in 1970 while in the Navy...the best 3 days ever, I've read it every year since. Having it on the Kindle makes it lighter...
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This will work well for us when we travel. I wish I had found it earlier. I wish it was a little louder though.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This is one of my favorite Iron Man movies.  The plot can get slow at times, but then it will pick up quickly with some good action.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book can't be defined in a few short sentences, so I will just tell the best of it. It had me hooked from the very first chapter. I could not stop reading it, I even stayed up very late just to read a little more of it. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is just amazing.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book! I picked the book up at a garage sale and finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. I have to say...these are some of the best books I have read. I will definitely read again! I'm curious how they are going to do a movie on this.... Seems too x-rated. Lol!
B0063S3DMK|1.0|I had to watch this movie for a world cinema class. The actors were okay but the movie was predictable and boring. I thought it would never end, and the themes/message of the movie were also nothing new. I can see how this kind of stuff would have appeal to a feminist but I found the movie to be terrible
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kid friendly...no concerns over material.  Temple run with more flavor.  Cost items are not cheap but oh well, I just won't buy them.  Peace and love to all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|That's Stephen King.....just an unstoppable force of psychic nature. I'm not sure why I need &#34;11 more words&#34; but tweets to you
B005TKD512|5.0|When I bought this book I thought that it would be only about organizational change. However to my surprise it deal with personnel change. The ideas presented by the authors can change your life.  Concepts such as rational mind vs feelings  dealing with failures, tweaking the environment,  breaking down the change, would help you on the part of change.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My daughter was required to read this for school but I looked at it and got interested and ending up reading it also.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I've been using this app for about 6 months an  I love it!  I always use it and it  never fails  to get me  best rates and allow for investigation  when to go.  Love it!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is great but it runs very slow at times and the constant asking to connect to facebook or twitter is irritating
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Swyping works great on my 2013 Nexus 7. However, the typing is ok.  It adds in extra letters out of nowhere and is hard to get the cursor where I want it to go from time to time.  At least it doesn't lock up like the normal Google keyboard does.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|READ THE BOOKS!!! DON'T WATCH THE CRAPPY MOVIE. THE MOVIE SUCKS. IT'S TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK. THEY WHOLE MOVIE YOU'RE LIKE WTF. THEY MADE THE CHARACTER LOOK DUMB.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This classic is sometimes remembered as the first science fiction novel, and its easy to see why.  Ender is both a child and a brilliant strategist, and this story is guaranteed to keep you guessing.  I learned a lot about war, and it is worrisome to think how little of this book is truly fiction.  A must-read for boys, and for sci-fi buffs of all genders and ages!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The app is good. I find it odd that the kindle doesn't come with a weather app (as an IOS device does).  But that has nothing to do with the quality of this app.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Yes, not as scary as The Shining but that's just fine with me.  Thank you, Mr. King, I will recharge my Kindle and start the story over right now. ---Constant Reader
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app WAS a life saver but now it's horrible! The old version may have been a little dull but is less confusing and easier to use which is way better than what it is now.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I wasn't crazy about how it ended, but I’m hoping there's another to follow! I would highly recommend  this book to anyone looking for a great book to read.

B004RL9T50|4.0|I normally don't watch children's movies, but I am glad that I watched this one. It was appropriate for children and yet still funny for adults. It's one of those rare movies that bridges the age gap. This movie shall have to join my DVD library.
0486211045|5.0|Excellent. Too good. Excellent. Marvelous.It is a good book. My son loves it. If I would need other one I ask for it as soon as possible
B00933JL0A|2.0|I love this game but apart of that comes with the feature of buying unlimited fast forward. I downloaded this on my kindle and the crown icon on the left side is no longer available which means you can't purchase add ons for the game. Very disappointed this feature is no longer available or at least not on the kindle.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is simple enough for a child to enjoy even without mastering it, while challenging for adults who want to collect points and complete levels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down....read within 2 days, bought book 2 as soon as I finished book 1...i'm ready for the next trilogy.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Frankie Muniz (TV's Malcolm of &#34;Malcolm in the Middle&#34; takes half the center stage along with an adorable dog who is Frankie's companion from puppyhood till his heartbreaking death while lying on the older Frankie's bed. This is a sweet and lovely &#34;boy and his dog&#34; story that's both funny and extremely touching, great for kids of all ages, including me and I'm 62! It's quite wonderful and not to be missed if you're looking for an excellent family film
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down....read within 2 days, bought book 3 as soon as I finished book 1...i'm ready for the next trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had missed the first season of Downton Abbey and I thoroughly loved watching the series over a matter of 3 days.  I could have watched it all the same day but family responsibilities got in the way.  Can't wait for next season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down....read within 2 days, I'm ready for the next trilogy. when will her new book come out...I'm ready
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I have only been able to see 3 or 4 of the shows of this first season, so I can't wait to sit down and see the entire season.  Having bought it, I can now share with friends and family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Easy to play for the kids, enjoyable for adults... a running, jumping, ducking game, and defeat evil ... reminds me of temple run... wish that costumes and items were less expensive, but game is fun without them.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|As with all Norah Jones songs... My husband and I love this cd. We would highly recommend buying this cd.
B00DW36G32|3.0|The movie itself was OK, but the HD quality, well, think we got ripped off!! The picture quality was THE worst EVER!! Hard to enjoy the movie because we couldn't see it!!!
B000N2HBSO|3.0|I thought it was very good history and insightful of the author's views of the time of Lincoln et al.<br /><br />On the flip side of that coin I didn't agree with a  point she made about Lincoln's personal life before marriage.  It took away some of her credibility as a historical author.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a well done second book in the series.  The ending is pretty weak and a little bit gimicky to get you to buy the third book, which makes me give it 4/5 instead of 5/5.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett ties history into the story that I can relate to as we struggle through our own current history of this planet.<br /><br />I would definitely  recommend this book to anyone were I asked about it.<br /><br />BC
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a pretty good book for all ages.  It's a refreshing look in the teen genre at how government can play a huge role in our lives.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I get these for my husband every Christmas.  He loved this.  We watch the dvds when there's nothing on tv and have been through the whole series several times.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton John. Many people associate the name with supposedly shallow radio pop, romance. That said \\"romance\\" sometimes is about topics such as suicide, loneliness, depression - who cares in radio land? But well: For the major time his music was generally tolerated and radio friendly .<br /><br />Connaisseurs of Elton John's work know that his most brilliant songs are to be found on his slightly unpoppier albums like \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\", \\"Madman Across The Water\\" or \\"Honky Chateau\\". This is the Elton John I love. Since his 2001 album \\"Songs From The West Coast\\" he's slowly returning to that style. And with \\"The Diving Board\\" he finally arrived. Elton's home again. Is this album comparable with the above? Yes and no. The youthful energy, back then combined with - for his tender age - quite mature song-writing, is gone and made room for... Wisdom of age wouldn't describe it adequately. The lyrics of his song-writing partner Bernie Taupin have become different, looking back, memory, reflection. Elton's compositions have changed as well, instead of rocky tunes we get rich black grooves as in \\"The Ballad Of Blind Tom\\" or \\"Take This Dirty Water\\". But one thing, I feel, is back: The tunes finally sound again as if Elton would've exploded if he couldn't have let them flow.<br /><br />There are few singers who have been through equally great changes vocally as Elton has. Thom Bell, drugs, a vocal cord surgery and age can be mentioned as major influences. Also his singing style has altered, and he has found the perfect phrasing for his now baritone voice. No more dramatic belting, a little dirt (malicious tongues say it's hoarse), and above all, real emotion. The musicians he and producer T-Bone Burnett have picked, go perfectly with it: retro-soul magician Raphael Saadiq on bass and Jay Bellerose as a brilliant drummer and percussionist. The trio of piano, bass and drums goes back to the early live-lineup of Elton John, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. This works perfectly andtickles some piano playing finesses out of Elton, who moved out of his comfort zone for this. Can he do it? Yes, he can!<br /><br />Personal favorites (actually I love everything, but I'll pick a few) :<br /><br />Take This Dirty Water - Gospel, coming in perfect shape. Groove and a mind-blowing choir, whose soulful quality gives me goosebumps.<br /><br />Dream # 3 - The last one of three short instrumental improvisations. A very jazzy, original showpiece, which could go on for another 20 minutes (and still be too short ).<br /><br />Voyeur - An incredibly intense ballad that really can stand comparison with songs like \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\". And lyrically I can not help but wondering if this \\"voyeur\\" actually is a fly watching everything from a \\"different point of view\\". That would meet the cheeky humor that's always been a part of the work of John and Taupin.<br /><br />My Quicksand - A melancholic ballad, with a hauntingly beautiful melody. This tune comes like a classical piano instrumental first and gets a wonderfully jazzy note in its run. This is just a personal feeling, but this song touched me in a similar way as George Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" as sung by Ella Fitzgerald. Magical.<br /><br />The Diving Board - New Orleans blues with an incredible horn section. A friend said that the tune brings up pictures of a black funeral band in the Mississippi Delta in her mind. Couldn't say it any better.<br /><br />The Ballad Of Blind Tom - Another soul groove, whose lyrics covering the autistic, enslaved composer \\"Blind\\" Tom Wiggins, who attracted listeners with unsusual compositions in the 19th century, sometimes military march, sometimes almost jazz. With his song-writing John bows to Wiggins, and still the melody is pure Elton. An irresistible symbiosis.<br /><br />I could go on forever, but for the ones in a hurry I can cut it short: This album may not be for everyone, but I'm honestly in love with it!
0593051580|5.0|What an eye-opener. A history major in college, I was so naive. I had no idea about this period in China. It is beautifully written.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoyed this book...well wasn't crazy about the ending...and I won't ruin your experience by telling you about the book...but overall I liked the writing style, character development, and the plot twists were GREAT! Very unexpected and exciting...seemed very original. If you like to read good mystery/thriller type novels you won't want to miss this one. Nothing gory...just mentally manipulative. Loved it!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and writing style so much I have already finished Gillian Flynn's first book &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; and I'm about to start &#34;Dark Places.&#34; Highly recommend this book and author!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Since I always have my smart phone with me, I now have my favorite books as well. They are easy to find and to read.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It seems that after the 1st JJ Abrams movie, he learned a lot, and this one was a lot better, it never had any dull spots. A lot of fun, and a new chapter in a familiar series.
B00464AVXW|5.0|Great cast, constant twists and shocking scenes - I watch it whenever it is on no matter what part it happens to be on when it comes on TV so decided to purchase it for a great price
0812982622|5.0|This is a chilling story set in an alien, highly controlled and very strange but fascinating environment;  the book is very well written and well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. The characters' personalities touch on the power in relationships that is relate able to most.
B002M9WW30|5.0|There is no way to write a negative review on this one. Blu-ray quality video and sound makes the VHS i had look like an old drive in movie. Great value for the whole series plus some bonus footage.
B009O07NMA|5.0|While staying in Pennsylvania for a month I listen to country music and fell in love with this group. I highly recommended this cd
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Since this movie took over 2 years to film, I kind of expected a better selection of \\"Extras\\". Where are all the deleted scenes? I recall reading an Entertainment Weekly interview with Brad Pitt and the director of the film and about all the scenes shot in Russia and Budapest. None of those scenes were show. In fact, there were NO deleted scenes. I saw the film twice in the theater and once on Blu-Ray and I couldn't tell the difference between the \\"Theatrical Version\\" and the \\"NEW UNRATED CUT with INTENSE FOOTAGE not shown in theaters.\\" I liked the movie, but I loved the book and the audio book much better. I feel like I got cheated with the DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital Copy set. Unless you MUST have the Blu-Ray and the Digital Copy, don't bother with this version. Save your money and buy a less expensive copy.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I been waiting for them to make a cd, boy it was worth the wait. I hope they tour in NY
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book is fascinating and very well written and easy to read. it is a interesting account of Steve Job's life and impact on the world.I would recommend this book to any one especially Apple and mac users.<br />Very insightful, thoughtful and informative.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much better than expected. I'd like to see many more puzzles, and a more challenging level. Different music wouldn't hurt.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|Really good. The characters pull you into a story where you genuinly feel for their problems and despair. Absolutely a good choice for a fantasy fan.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I had fun solving the mystery. I liked that the game combined hidden objects and puzzles. Overall I really like this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Haven't played a game this challenging in a long time. Sure beats temple run....... At least it makes you think
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I frequent James's blog often and I consistently receive value from it. This book does just the same. It is jammed pack with life lessons and amazing advice that will alter your perception on reality forever.<br /><br />Before learning about James I didn't realize creativity was a skill that can be improved upon. Through his daily practice I have seen supernatural-like results in my own self. I can think faster, see ideas in whole new perspectives, and am overall more happy. I also didn't understand the full potential of ones own ability in life. Even if you don't read this book. Learn about James Altucher's life so you know what is humanely possible.
1586638491|5.0|This is a great way for kids to learn Shakespeare without being an expert in the english language.  I have bought more than a few of these for high school readers.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is the 3rd book I've read by Gaiman and like the others, it offers yet another fantasy version of reality close enough and believable enough to hold me in thrall.  This one however, has a little boy and girl as it's hero and heroine.  Charming, scary, mind bending, unique, entertaining.  A little too short for me, but then, someone told me it was expanded from a short story.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Yeah, if you aren't a square ... this book will knock your socks off with its totally unique take on how to tell a story.<br /><br />Happy ending ?  Did it even end?  Outrageous visual pictures and plenty of action and love and mystery.<br /><br />How did she do it ?  I don't know, but I love it and want more from this author.
B000NY17J6|5.0|This CD contains every Ronstadt song you could possibly want - it's the best compilation of any artist anfd since Linda can no longer sing this is a must buy

B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Not worth your time and space. Not what  it looks to be, very disappointing. Need to re word their description
B003B02O14|4.0|This is a great read, it does give lawyers a bit of a bad name. The story line is  novel.

1476727651|5.0|I don't know about most of you, but vampires do NOT sparkle.  They're monsters.  This is something Stephen King knows well.<br /><br />So many other reviews have summarized the novel, so I won't bother.<br /><br />This isn't THE SHINING.  Yes, there are references and if you've never read the book you won't get them.  There are references to several other King works, including son-of-King, Joe Hill's NOS4A2.  (Read that one, by the way - it's really good.)<br /><br />DOCTOR SLEEP is genuinely creepy.  It will disturb your dreams and make you jump at unexpected noises or shadows.  Yes, the villians have strange names, but so do many real-world evils.  And there's something very disturbing about evil overlaid with banal.<br /><br />Which is something Stephen King is extremely good at.  Along with vivid word pictures.<br /><br />Just read the book.  Then try to go to sleep without a light on,,,,,,,,
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|I love this movie, I was not excited to see it until i heard that Baz Luhrmann was directing it, it changed my mind. I saw it, and ,Loved it. the movie is SO Baz. You will love it!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek for over 40 years. This was the best movie released yet. I can't wait to see the next one.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a really fun game and i play it with my son. He plays it all day and every dat
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I don't see any difference between this version and the free one. Anyway it's my favorite game. I am addicted to it.<br />I would like the on line game.... It's not true: I would spend too much time on it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game I think every one in the world should get the game it is for little kid and big kids
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I love this series!! It is hilarious!! It makes me laugh so hard I have cried!! I would definitely recommend this!
B00DU77QP2|1.0|I have read this book and in the beginning of the book i was enraptured with the storyline and the characters. The plot was very cliche but the characters were very real but i have to say I was disgusted by the twist of this book and came to hate it very quickly. I cannot finish reading the series and it is disappointing because i did enjoy the characters. I am not recommending this book to any fellow reader.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I never had a chance to watch this when it first came out . I didn't realize what I was missing. It's a great show.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Directed by actor Dustin Hoffman, \\"Quartet\\" tells the story of three friends - Reginald (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred (Billy Connolly) and Cecily (Pauline Collins, who previously appeared in TV's \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" and the 1989 film, \\"Shirley Valentine) - who live together in a home for retired musicians.  They are all quite surprised when the fourth person of their former quartet - Reggie's ex-wife Jean (Maggie Smith) - becomes a new resident.  The four lead actors are, of course, wonderful, and I found the film to be a charming comedy/drama worth seeing.  And it's Dame Maggie Smith, who is always a pleasure to watch.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|this show is intense and addictive. not what I usually watch but now I am hooked! I highly recommend watching
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a real page turner.  Make sure you keep a hanky with you when you are reading it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what is needed for small everyday use  it is great for all needs. Simple is the best way to go.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The book becomes tedious and not very interesting. Take what you get! I don't like your word requirement it's ridiculous.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The visuals were great but so much of the scenes were the same as the first movie reboot.  The story of a criminal fleeing from federation space and the choice to destroy instead of try him is an attempt at sparking conversation of terrorist kills.  While I think his attempt is noteworthy it remains unresolved in movie.  I would ask that next time instead of redoing all the action sequences new ones be filmed.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is my second case for my Kindle Fire. I returned the first one after two days.  The problem was that the first case didn't have a &#34;stand&#34; for widescreen viewing.  I quickly researched more cases and found this one.  What I like:  It has a &#34;stand&#34; for widescreen viewing, it's very slim and fits in my purse (I take it everywhere with me), the closure strap has been very sturdy.  What I don't like: It doesn't have a &#34;stand&#34; for standard/portrait viewing.  But hey, that's not a big deal for me. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone.  I have had mine for 18 months and still love it.
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|I picked up this app due to the subscription price that it displayed on the Amazon App Store to see how it worked out compared to other remote PC applications such as GOTOMYPC.com or Teamviewer. As I like the functionality of the the program, all of the admin features and such, there seems to be a major lag that occurs when using for multimedia programs.<br /><br />Standard web browsing and viewing documents seems to be alright. Being that I work with multimedia programs in my line of business, It is important to have a program that works well with any type of viewing needed. I would really recommend sticking with one of the other remote access programs over this one if you would be using for multimedia purposes like I do.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|I was reluctant to watch it but I admit it took me to my youth time and the music that was my Soundtrack.

I Have been using evernote for a while and the moleskine has been very helpfull to integrate my written notes into my digital life.<br />The size is not intrusive in my backpack and you get the best quality in notebooks there is.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is an awesome tool. I use it everyday to follow  the devotional plans. There are so many topics to choose from. First rate product. Highly recommended.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|I am a huge fan and was very fortunate to go to a Rammstein concert. I was very happy with this purchase
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good story, could use more gore. Why was brad Pitt better looking than his wife? I did enjoy every minute of the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because it is filled with action and you don't know what will happen next.  I want to read the next book in the series to see who Katniss has feelings for.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|I know that I have a minority opinion, but I think Abrams' story telling is poor.  He seems so bent on action sequences, while passing on a weak script.  For example, the action sequence of Mr. Evil's (sorry, uh, \\"Khan's\\") attack on the emergency meeting of Star Fleet elites is just dumb.  Why have a high-level strategic meeting in a plain ol highrise with nice big windows... the better for Mr. Evil to kill you all... with his ultra killing helicopter?<br /><br />Then there are a lot of wink-and-nod references to TOS, but no respect for the legacy.  Why completely change the Khan character, so well exploited in the 2nd movie?  With all the possible directions to go, why lazily pick out this character again and \\"re-imagine\\" it?  And recycling the Khhaaaaan! yell and the self-sacrifice thing, to me, just turns them into too much self-aware smirking.<br /><br />Look at the better movies (ST 2 and ST 6).  Characters (by Ricardo Montelban and Christopher Plummer) were well developed, given clear motivations, and great lines.  You liked them in some ways, a great way to magnify their menace.<br /><br />I'm likely showing my age, but expect more than action sequences and illogical plot points.  The novelty of computer graphics is gone, as should be the awe of hyperkinetic animation. I wish younger viewers would be more demanding of productions that cost $200 million dollars and bigger profits. And listening to Mr. Abram's self congratulatory comments about the his \\"Mystery Box\\"(TM) approach to filming is just too much.  It's easy to get big heads in our society.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing. Yes, I like most of the new ST characters quite a bit.  However, taking Kirk even further down the swaggering path is, to my taste, too much.  His apple-eating ways and smarty-pants behavior on the bridge just doesn't fit as a leader in a quasi-military outfit. He needs some basic training on decorum and leadership.  Too much \\"cool\\" (or sloppyness) for my likes.

All the mini-histories of the competitors involved coupled with the continual scientific conversation of the running people made for an extremely smooth read with an easy running education and plenty of levity and heart warming moments.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Ok So I like buying the 3D version for my 3D tv and this may change from TV to TV but the 3D quality translates well to the blu ray copy. I also like to collect my digital copies just so I can get back to my movie without finding the disc. I like this movie and this allows me my 3D version and also a digital copy which is all I will most likely use.

B001BANK32|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out and have the paperback somewhere.  The first read was a scary, Stephen King story and as in all his books the characters become real and you travel with their adventure.  I can't say what I would have rated it on the first read as my impression was so long ago<br />.<br />But I downloaded the ebook into my Kindle tor bring me up to speed in advance of his then pre-ordered Dr. Sleep, which is a follow up to the original.<br /><br />Refreshing my mind of the story was essential to reading Stephen Kings upcoming book.  Therefore I read with that mindset and reattached my self in maybe a more intense way to really grasp The Shining.  I am so glad I did.  I enjoyed the 2nd read I think more then the first as it is now memorable, the characters have become alive and I could not wait for the now released Dr.Sleep which I am presently reading.  I highly recommend if you haven't read it, if you have read before like I did, read AGAIN, you need the characters to be fresh before you start the next step which is the newly released Dr. Sleep.  Thank you Stephen King for your ability not only to create believable characters but paint them so colorfully that they become real.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I've been on a medieval kick recently and happened upon this whilst searching for something else on Amazon.  I watched the first episode, which got me right away with the combat scene in the Eastern Baltic.  This is more than blood and guts, though; the writers have mixed themes of family, friendship, loyalty, and adventure with the combat we expect so much from a show about Vikings.  I found myself genuinely interested in developments of plot and character alike.  I look forward to seeing another season.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I am not upset about the differences between them. It was kinda-cool to read it and get the surprises; except the basic themes and ending.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I got a little lost about 3/4 of the way through.  I think I recovered - not sure.  The characters were very real and the emotions attributed to the women caused me to stop and read sections again, they were so realistic - familiar - I've had many of these myself.  Mr. Hosseini can really write.  I'll be watching for the next one.  The lack of violence in this one wasn't missed, by me anyway.  The emotional experiences the people had was violence enough.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed A Dance with Dragons much more than A Feast for Crows. I was glad to see my favorite characters return to the story (Dany, Tyrion, Jon Snow) however I really think the scope of Martin's story has grown too broad. In the early books, it was easy to see how Dany's story related to the goings-on in King's Landing, even though they were completely separate. Even though there were several different locations where the action took place and some of the characters never interacted, I could imagine how (eventually) everyone might link up. After this book, however, I am truly not sure how Martin will manage to connect the different stories. There are too many secondary point-of-view characters at this point in the series. I still enjoy the story but I have concerns. I also have concerns about the release of the sixth book, since there were six years between the fourth and fifth books, when Martin stated in the epilogue of FfC there would be a year.

B00ET9T2WK|4.0|I really like turn based strategy games and this one is a great addition to my collection(this feels almost like a turn based version of &#34;Rise of Nations,&#34; one of my all time favorite games, minus the progress through time). Sadly the in-game battles seem to be a little intense on my Kindle FIre HD's Wi-Fi strength and causes frequent disconnects or the servers they are running on drop me mid fight. I can no longer do the PVP battles and this has started to happen more and more frequently, but if you have a good connection and the tablet for it, this is worth a try.

0553384775|3.0|I admit freely that I only became interested in this book because I saw the advance trailer for the Scorsese film, as yet unreleased, of the same name.<br /><br />Just as GOODFELLAS was an incredible film, I don't doubt that this will be as well. That being said, the truth about people like Henry Hill - and this case, Jordan Belfort<br />is that while their lives make for salacious and interesting pulp, deep down they are truly horrible people - a fact that Hollywood glosses over because they would<br />otherwise have trouble giving the audience a protagonist.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed Jordan's first-hand style, (although the reviews calling him a \\"great\\" writer are almost comedically overblown). The stories he tells - embellished or no -<br />are great reading, and totally believable. But Jordan mails in the final chapter in an attempt to sell a follow up book \\"CATCHING THE WOLF OF WALL STREET\\" which is more about his time<br />as an informant for the government.<br /><br />I gave three stars because in the end Jordan Belfort doesn't seem to have changed as a man. He blames much of what he did (conveniently) on drugs, but he was sober<br />when he made many of the decisions he made, stealing from and hurting many, many people - and maybe worst of all he even turned on his oldest and most loyal friends to simply<br />save himself. He justifies this as being \\"for his family\\" but he doesn't see how selfish and hollow that excuse is. What about the families of all the people he ruined? Not<br />a single word of remorse.<br /><br />Finally, I recently caught Belfort on an Aussie talk-show pumping the upcoming movie, and he could not have been more smug or self-centered -- as if all of it was just some<br />crazy fraternity prank.<br /><br />If, at the end of the upcoming movie, you feel sorry for Leo DiCaprio's character, credit Martin Scorsese - because if you reach the end of this book and you won't feel sorry for Jordan Belfort at all.

B00DJ80VLS|1.0|It's a shame that a band like DT have to constantly mar their beautiful, intricately crafted music with awful, brick-walled recordings.<br /><br />I like the music I'm hearing here, but listening to it is tiring and frustrating. The clipping and compression especially noted in MM's cymbals is just too big of a hurdle to get over. It doesn't matter if I'm listening on earbuds or in my car; listening to the record is a chore.<br /><br />Unfortunately, DT albums are usually substandard in terms of sound. Self-Titled is absolutely a new low.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a GREAT read.  Well written and the plot kept you guessing.  Even when some \\"secrets\\" were revealed there were twists and turns that you just couldn't predict.  I won't summarize the plot - others have done so.  I do recommend it as one of those wonderful \\"can't put down\\" books.
B00ALGW286|5.0|\\"Moscow Dreams\\" is a front row seat on a ride through huge political changes in 1991 Russia.

Fear of what the future holds, ties of friendship, and determination to succeed--no matter what the odds--drives this beautifully written story forward.<br /><br />**Five Stars**

Carolyn McCormic puts so much heart and emotion into the story as she narrates it.  Having read/listened to Harry Potter, Twilight, the Help and Divergent, I must say that the Hunger Games has the best narrator and I loved the entire series.<br /><br />~*~ Everyone should read this series. ~*~

B00F0N7JUG|2.0|The digital copy contained in this pack is for use with an application called Flixster ONLY!!  Yes, the movie can be downloaded to your computer, and moved to an tablet or phone, however, it has to have the Flixster app to watch your digital copy.  This means no watching via your AppleTV, Roku, or Android/Other TV streaming device, unless you can get the Flixster app installed.  This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Warner Brothers account, and a Flixster account.  If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes.  This was a very sad attempt at Warner Brothers for trying to make the consumer buy another copy of the movie.  Several other companies are doing it as well, such as Sony.
B00B1COIRC|5.0|Two very positive reviews to start and they are very welcome.<br />Because.....in my opinion...this charming and delightful film could be damaged by the ultra sophisticated.<br />Who, possibly, will damn it with faint praise and accusations that only the modern sophisticate can dream up.<br />Best to take heed of the majority views that exist here and in other reviews.<br />Then once it is seen I hope that people will share my enthusiasm and it will enjoy the success I believe<br />it deserves.<br />A French film with sub titles may not entice. But.....check it out people.<br />You may be very pleasantly surprised.

0307743659|5.0|So in anticipation of the release of Stephen King's novel DOCTOR SLEEP I thought it prudent to re-read THE SHINING, since the last time I read the saga of the Overlook Hotel was in 1982, so in a way I wasn't exactly re-reading but rediscovering. At the awkward age of 13 I read my first King novel, CUJO, and the horror was less disturbing than the sexual innuendo that was happening with the mother. IMO, King, like Woody Allen, has been firing on all cylinders for so long, with such a success to failure ratio, that he has moved beyond iconic stature. If you think back to those early days of King, from CARRIE through DELORES CLAIBORNE, that's almost twenty years unbroken (which includes THE STAND, which, IMO, belongs in the Canon of Western Literature) with classics like SALEM'S LOT, CHRISTINE, IT, NEEDFUL THINGS, the aforementioned CUJO etc. And he isn't finished. This summer's JOYLAND was a delight, and later, post-accident King has delivered THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, CELL, UNDER THE DOME and 11/22/63 in addition to some strong short story/novella collections. So re-visiting the Torrance family was a welcome return to my childhood, but, that being said, how did it hold up? THE SHINING, which is officially King's third published novel (excluding Bachman titles) was released upon the world in 1977 when (according to DOCTOR SLEEP) a peanut farmer was in the White House. You can easily search the internet for stories of King's displeasure with the iconic 1980 film version, and the fan flames about which is better, since the book and film have very different endings, but the claustrophobia is the overriding factor in both works. I think it would be an insult to rehash the plot of THE SHINING, but suffice it to say that the story of three damaged people trapped in a mammoth haunted house for eight months touches on both the ordinary and the supernatural. Like the film, Dick Halloran (aka Scatman Crothers) is an integral part of the book, as are the ghosts of the Overlook, with that creepy man-in-the-dog-costume scene expounded, making it even more creepy. King is still master or combining the personal with the horrific and that definitely shows in THE SHINING, with the amount of backstory equal or greater to the time in the hotel. At 650-pages the novel seems more laborious than I remembered, but the feeling of isolation that King paints is still vivid to me 30+ years later.ook, with that creepy man-in-the-dog-costume scene expounded, making it even more creepy.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|I had heard good things about this series and had never seen it.  Season 1 was the first thing I downloaded.  I was totally hooked and have seen all three seasons in a very short time.  The house and costumes are amazing. The layers of individual stories and plots are captivating.  It is a fabulous glimpse into the lives of a class society that  we don't see in  such an elegant way in todays world.
B00CUKTGW6|3.0|Well obviously this is a great box set from the box itself to the japanese style Mini-LP CDs, but no bonus tracks at all? I can understand that they don't wanna give you everything they're giving you in the big more expensive Sound System box, but at least they could've given us the B-sides off the singles that came off those albums. That's a large part of what makes the japanese Mini-LP CDs so great. Slightly disappointed about that, since i don't believe that anyone will fork out $177.00 just for those. So we're stuck with an un-remastered version of Super Black Market Clash.

I was not fat per say but climbing up there and wanted to nip it all in the bud.  Especially the belly! This way of eating did it, and still is working to further slim my waist.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|I have been a fan of melodic music for all of my life, but I have only gotten around to listen to Elton John music a bit more than a year ago (28 years old, so didn't grow up in his peak era). Up till that point, I have known very basic and general info on Elton, but not much about his music. Boy, wish I did earlier in my life, because listening to this man's compositions has made me rediscover why I fell in love with melodic music all over again. I am now familiar with all of his works, and a hardcore fan for who I consider my all-time favorite musician. I consider myself not completely biased to his 70s material like some of the long-time fans, as I don't hold any specific attachment to it, all of his music is new to me (though a lot of my favorite albums from him are from the 70s, but I also love his work since Songs from the West Coast in 2001, and portions of his 80s and 90s).<br /><br />I had the pleasure to anticipate an Elton album release for the first time of my life, and it was very exciting. The Diving Board deserved every bit of anticipation I had, and did not disappoint. It is definitely up there with his best work, and the surprising element in it that really got me off guard is that it is unique, and has an identity of its own unlike some of his similar sounding albums. For a man at this age, I have to be really impressed with the effort and craftsmanship that is displayed in the Diving Board, an album that may very well be among my top 10 Elton albums; not an easy feat considering the amount of great albums Elton has made over the decades.<br /><br />I would briefly talk about how I felt about each song:<br /><br />1. Oceans Away (8/10): Really soothing introduction to the album, and reminds me of Elton's talent in creating such moving ballads. It also works in dictating the general vibe of the album (moody and weighty)<br /><br />2. Oscar Wilde Gets Out (9/10): Up there with the best of Elton's up tempo songs. The beat and melody are very recognizable, and this one I fell immediately in love with unlike some of the other tracks that require repeated listens. This is the track I would use to get people interested in this album, as it is quite easy to listen to and appreciate<br /><br />3. A Town Called Jubilee (7/10): Probably my least favorite track on the album, yet it still gets a 7 as it's a pleasant listen, though not very memorable or unique. In some of Elton's weaker albums, this would be one of the best tracks, which indicates the overall quality of this album<br /><br />4. The Ballad of Blind Tom (8/10): This one is a grower, didn't impress me much on the first listen but now I really enjoy its haunting melody. I always loved Elton's more dramatic melodies, the cellos in the song definitely add to its eerie mood and flow into the lyrics very smoothly<br /><br />5. Dream 1 -> My Quicksand (9/10): I would treat each dream piece as a part or intro of the song that follows it, because I believe their placement makes more sense that way. I have seriously debated to give this song a 10, as it is an absolute standout for me, and could potentially be my favorite track over the long run. This is unlike any of Elton's work, has a killer piano solo part that is THE best part of the album. Piano has always been my favorite instrument, and this track drives home the point of Elton's mastership of this instrument. It could very well be a 10 after a few days; the only reason for a 9 is that I find the song hard to get into without some headphones. In the right mood, this is simply unforgettable.<br /><br />6. Can't Stay Alone Tonight (9/10): This is classic Elton material, probably the catchiest melody in the album. It's very memorable, has a very nice hook, and just plain fun to listen to and sing along with. This is the song for those who enjoy Elton's pop and radio hits.<br /><br />7. Voyeur (8/10): Started out as a very mediocre track in the beginning, this song has grown on me the most, every time I listen to it I find more to like and gets more interesting. It seems like a mix of Elton's classic tunes, along with some of his recent work, combined with Elton's deep voice that really gives it a character of its own<br /><br />8. Home Again (8/10): Lyrics are the main attraction to me in this one in particular (great job Bernie). The words are so honest, direct, and carry such strong emotions and make me remember my life and my past, and almost get me to tear up. Elton's delivery is top notch, with some really great piano work. The melody is great, but it lacks the unique aspect that I got from many of the other songs in this album<br /><br />9. Take This Dirty Water (7/10): Pleasant song and surprisingly memorable. Elton needs to do more in this style in general as it adds diversity to his catalogue and demonstrates his versatility as an artist. Makes me groove!<br /><br />10. Dream 2 -> The New Fever Waltz (9/10): What a song. Almost teared up from the very first listen, and almost wanted to rewind it before going to the next song. Such an emotional and beautiful song that reminds me a lot of tracks from his self-titled album (i.e. I Need you to Turn to, Greatest Discovery, First Episode to Hienton), but Elton's deep voice takes it to another level, and the lyrics are beautiful. This and My Quicksand are my contenders of favorite track in the album.<br /><br />11. Mexican Vacation (8/10): Another grower with more interesting facets appearing after each listen. It appears very simplistic at first, but that's what makes it so different, and Elton's spreads his signature style on it in small bits that makes it a unique mix of Elton and bar blues music.<br /><br />12. Dream 3 -> The Diving Board (9/10): A standout title and embodies the unique aspect of this album. Never knew Elton was capable of composing such a song as he only showed some hints of such compositions in Blue Moves, and here he achieves greater success as it feels much more complete with a stronger structure than his Blue Moves experiments. Dream 3 works so well as an introduction to it, and puts the spotlight on Elton's unparalleled skill on the piano, taking your mind adrift just like a true dream.<br /><br />Overall, this is by far one of the most consistent Elton albums; there isn't any song that I would skip. It merges and integrates a lot of what Elton has done in the past, with traces from Blue Moves, Songs from the West Coast, Tumbleweed Connection, and even Too Low For Zero. The icing on that delicious mixture is songs like the title track, Dream 3, and My Quicksand, which represent the live performer side, as well as an almost new side of Elton that I haven't seen. As a result, The Diving Board forges an identity of its own that is refreshing, intriguing, and yet remains at its core that melodic beautiful sound of Elton.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|so many moods can be created from this album. I have never heard of this band and I was inspired by the samples as well as the reviews. I know I will never get tired of the strong continuous riffs that blend and wave into one long continuous sound. there are other experiments within that work well building from cleaner strings to strong raw distortion that has distortion added to it.<br /><br />I immediately liked this album. almost makes me nervous to try another one as my expectation will be extremely high.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|I love this movie. The acting was great in this film. I like this one much better than the second movie. Action scenes were great.
0895260131|1.0|I bought this book at a bookstore for 7 dollars. I advise EVERYONE to not buy this book. it is boring. Robert spencer is by NO means a Islamic scholar. The chapters literally all sound the same even though the title is different.  He (spencer) drones on and on and on about same thing. he constantly refers to same thing he just quoted or said earlier. same small verses without giving the context which he quotes was written at, or passages after. and when he does write verse before and after , you can clearly see he just hung himself because it gives the common person the explanation that is far from what he (spencer) says it means.  Don't buy this book. save yourself the cash unless you want to waste it. then by all means do.
B0031RS894|4.0|It was a lot shorter than I expected, having read a few of Jacqueline's Doctor Who books before. However, the content did not disappoint. Never a dull moment. Always action and suspense!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Great Album...... So glad to hear that sexy voice tell his story in true Rod Style......... Great to hear NEW Rod music. For an old man Rod still has it !!!  ~
1476727651|5.0|It came earlier than expected, and I was refunded money as the price went down which was a nice surprise and I would have never noticed, so impressed with the honesty to honor best price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this book alot.  Told well, considering the subject matter it really makes you think about how you would handle yourself if placed in this situation.  Can't wait to read the next.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|It didnt play on my XBox but worked on my laptop for some reason. Good movie with good cast. ....I enjoyed.
B005Y9B5UG|4.0|For some reason I thought this was a CD but it turned out to be a DVD. This is OK, and I'm enjoying it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I guess I need to read the description more closely.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I would like to see more of this story. A really good movie with a good message as well as a good plot.
0307271080|3.0|At the beginning, at a Lagos secondary school, Ifemelu and Obinze fall in love. Ifemelu gets the chance to go to America to attend collage, it seemed like a good story, but honestly by the end, I did not like Ifemelu (the female main character) for some reason, during many parts of the story I felt like slapping her.<br /><br />It is a good story, well written, but parts of it just wore on me
B005F2BBLK|1.0|This movie was just too stupid too even be amusing. I heard it was supposed to be really funny, but my friend admitted she was wasted when they saw it.
B00DSTBMMU|2.0|It sounds like she's trying to be something she's not. I've been a serious fan since she came on the scene but I sadly have to admit this isn't her best work. What's up with the country twang inflection in her voice that is smeared all over these songs? Seriously. I had to research \\"Callin' Me When I'm Lonely\\" to see if that was Miranda Lambert singing it. Sounds like she's trying on other singer's styles and there are only fleeting moments when it sounds like her. Sometimes she's trying to sing like Loretta Lynn, sometimes Crystal Gayle. I don't think an artist should be stuck in a style, but this sounds less like experimentation and more like copying.
0744014956|5.0|I'm a massive fan like most people of the series so I spent the extra few dollars for the nicer guide.  If you're only looking for information and don't care about a bound cover and extra artwork the standard edition would suffice.  I haven't checked recently but I'm sure the internet will have free walkthroughs any day now, albeit mostly text instead of containing photos of locations, etc.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|This record is FB's coming out party. Although music from their last record \\"Tarot Sport\\" was featured during the 2012 Summer Olympics, Slow Focus is much more accessible, and a better all around album that will garner lots of worldwide attention for the UK duo. While the first two records were much more of an exploration of sound, noise, and experimentation in the genre, Slow Focus is much more defined, a beautifully chiseled slab of electronic bliss from start to finish. For me, the record is the perfect blend of intensity and intellectual reflection. It is an album that can be danced to, but also used as an aid for your mind to wander dangerously far from your physical being. The tracks run into one another like a waterfall into a river. It makes for a transcendental experience. One that may not be for everyone. In fact I know it's not for everyone. And that's the beauty of it.
0553384775|1.0|This book is terrible - poorly written and incredibly boring.  The story drags on and on and the author goes into way too much detail about the dullest things.  He brags constantly and shows no remorse for the crimes he committed.  It is sad to think that an idiot like this could make so much money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was amazing! Really kept you wanting to continue. I read it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read! Easy to get into and hard to put down :) definitely a romance novel but not too sexual to pass on to your mom.
1400049628|5.0|No?<br /><br />Then you need this!! Japan is really close to developing the zombie virus. Even though that is screwed up beyond belief, we must accept the Japanese hate reality and one day Zombie will be upon us.<br /><br />SO LEARN HOW TO SURVIVE!!! Because I don't want any dummies joining me in the life after-Zombies and ruining my Zombieland-esque adventure through my new land where I am king and Justin Beiber is DEAD and forgotten!!!
B008220BLG|5.0|Not really into the whole zombie thing, but this was a good movie.  My kids and I love it.  It packs a different twist as the zombies, through caring are able to become less of zombies and regain some of their humanity.  Love the storyline and the price was right.  The DVD itself looked brand new!!
B00001ZWTT|4.0|This movie is awesome. Also everyone must watch it because it is stereotypical way to explain Steampunk to stupid people. So... watch this movie!!!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|this was a great opportunity to test the universe directly for evidence that it's listening and responding to our thoughts.  the author was amusing and kept the content interesting by inserting humor.  I've shared it with friends!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I liked this movie, but it's weird. I hated it the first time. Apprechiated what it tried to do the second, then it grew on me with my love of steampunk/dieselpunk. In the end, it is a really good movie.<br /><br />Go Jude Law! He was awesome.
B009LDCZDC|1.0|As another reviewer noted, we received the second season of Homeland on Bluray as a gift (had been purchased through Amazon) and when we opened the package we found we had duplicates of disc 2 and no disc 3. What the hell are we supposed to do with this?
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is by far the best series that has ever aired.... sept for Firefly.... and IT Crowd.....<br /><br />But it's awesome. KNOW THIS! It is awesome....<br /><br />So buy this, watch it. It's funny, slightly nerdy, action packed, pop culture, suspensful, and has Nathan Fillion in it. It's fantastically shiny!!!<br /><br />So watch it. Now. DOIT!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book for any engaged couple. I think any struggling marriage needs this book. God bless Dr.Chapman for such great insight.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this app I can watch all my favourite videos on my kindle<br />It's a perfect app for video watchers lol
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This is a thinking person's movie. It is experiential as well as cerebral. I dont know if I'll ever understand all of it and thats ok. It might be intended to be that way.It is hard to imagine how the actors, writers and directors accomplished this.  All deserve high praise. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4 stars and watched it three times, which is exactly what I'm going to do. If not 4 or 5 times.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I normally do not review music cd's but I had to do one on this one because I was amazed at how good this one is. Whether you like Britney Spears or not you will like the catchy tunes on this one. If you love dance music, you may want to check this one out. I checked this simply because I liked Gimme More and Piece of Me but ended up falling in love with other tracks here. Toy Soldier is one dance track that I really liked. I also liked Hot as Ice. I actually liked these two tracks more than the aforementioned hits. Had I not picked this album up, I would have missed out on these tracks which did not get any, if at all, radio airplay. The only bad track on this whole album is Heaven on Earth. And it is not necessarily because of the song itself but in the recording. The sound of this track is horrible. It sounds over compressed or overdriven. Someone messed up on this track big time. And I tried it on a different stereo and noticed the same poor quality. And I do use high end equipment so it is not the stereo. I would rate this one of Britney Spears' best albums. If you are thinking that you already own one of her greatest hits albums so you don't need to include this in your collection, you are missing out on two of her great dance tracks.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Really fun recommend to everyone! Very entertaining especially when I need to pass some time it gets very hard especially because you have to drive the level without flipping your car over and ot running out of gas it is a tough yet fun game.
B000002MFE|5.0|This album covers a lot of Eric's best (in my opinion) songs. I never get tired of listening to it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|My wife and I will truly miss this great author and one bad ass character in Mitch Rapp. We have read every one of Mr. Flynn's books and were never disappointed. If you are new to this author and character I suggest you start with his first novel and work your way to the end, you will not be sorry.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I want to go write fan fiction myself, about these characters.  While I am off typing, give yourself ten hours of reading delight and buy/borrow this book.<br /><br />It is so great when a story gives you plenty of material on each character, and when you've had a chance to form an impression, then one character comes out and sums it up, just the right way.  This is a story about identical twins starting a new life at college.  How are they similar and how are they different?  It's a fascinating portrait of the sisters, their unusual family dynamic, the threads of each parent's quirks that spring up in each twin, the reluctant twin's first romance.  I love this author's wit and pop culture references.  The dialog is so snappy.  It's such fun when all the characters can keep up with the repartee.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was well written, very descriptive.  It  had good characters, a little magic, a really different plot. I could see it as a movie.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|An absolute classic and must read for all - not just runners. This book will inspire you to do wonderful things.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I cant get out of this mandatory review. What's the deal? Goodbye and adios. Ssve me from this. Please. Help.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I have loved all the NIN works to date...this is the first one that didn't feel \\"necessary\\" to the ears.  All of the past albums had an urgency and message that felt like Reznor really had something to get off his chest.  This time, it feels like Trent *decided* to make a NIN album and went ahead and made one.  But the lyrical urgency isn't there for me, and that makes a difference.  The worldview that was so consistent in the past now feels diluted and sometimes forced.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Lots of flare but bad acting!  If you did not see gi Joe as a child you wouldn't understand what was going on until they explained somewhat.
1465414444|3.0|The layout of the book is nice and does a nice job of going through the history of Warcraft.  The behind the scenes has nothing to do with the development of Warcraft and basically shows you pictures of Blizzcon and Blizzcon Panels along with some Warcraft merchandise.  No pictures of the developers working in house or even the support team behind Warcraft.  I take 2 stars away for this because the description read as &#34;even goes be yond the game, giving readers a peek at the behind-the-scenes development of Blizzard's vivid fantasy world.&#34; and is nothing that you won't see on any website that covers Blizzcon.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|It was hilarious...it had a good story behind it.  Reminded me of my grandpa.  Made me laugh a lot. Will watch again.
B003G4W49C|3.0|It was OK<br />Kept me engaged, but at times felt it was childish.<br />To be expected, as it is a child that the book is written about.<br /><br />Still an OK ~ Good book
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey has changed my view of taking a classical instrument and makin git work very nicely with electronic.  I love listening to her music while workng out and just driving.  I would recommend you purchase the album and just enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the trilogy in a few days.  Couldn't wait for the movie to come out.  Looking forward to Catching Fire!
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|If you're looking to purchase this movie, you've probably already seen it. If not, what the hell's the matter with you?! How can you look yourself in the mirror every morning and not feel like a lesser man than your peers? Quick dickin around and push &#34;add to cart&#34; before your wife leaves you for the mail man!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome keep updateing it please :):):):):) love it keep on being awesome by the way next update add bannans chest
B003K16P3M|1.0|...books like these only make me speculate as to authors age / maturity... this one seems to be a \\"tweener\\" and not too talented a writer yet... maybe this just done for practice? Don't bother with this...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game with great updates and upgrades. Only thing that would make it better would be to make more things available to buy with the bananas you earn each run.
0793906091|5.0|Good Seller.<br /><br />The product came fast and it plays great!!!<br /><br />This is the only way to watch the Trilogy. No updated Sound F/X and other cut in scenes that screw up the movies flow.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The book could've been a lot better. Felt like it was rushed towards the ending. The story was good, but there was so much more that could have been done to it.
0785152466|5.0|I love everything by Mark Miller and JR JR!!! Mark Miller is a fantastic story teller and his amazingly grand scope can only be captured by the FANTASTIC ART of John Romita JR.  This story is sick and twisted and really gets into the nitty gritty of what it would be like to be a REAL SUPER HERO in the REAL WORLD. Your just not going to win all the time. This sequel continues the stories told in Kick Ass and in Hit Girl and is fantastic!!<br /><br />Pick it up and read it today!!

0785165975|5.0|I love everything by Mark Miller and JR JR!!! Mark Miller is a fantastic story teller and his amazingly grand scope can only be captured by the FANTASTIC ART of John Romita JR.  This story is sick and twisted and really gets into the nitty gritty of what it would be like to train as a REAL SUPER HERO in the REAL WORLD. Things are not set to a 5 minute mantra of practice shots, and running up hill and trying to break boards to finally break through one. It's not a series of high-fiving and being long time chums. It's hard work, dedication, not winning all the time and dealing with defeat time and time again. This sequel continues the story told in Kick Ass and is fantastic!!<br /><br />Pick it up and read it today!!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|If you are looking for the pop master and top 40 hit machine, you MAY not like this album. If you are looking for real, quality music that is beautifully crafted, this is an EXCELLENT album. Elton's piano playing has never been better but what surprised me the most was the vocal diversity that he is still able to perform with. I am very pleased  with this effort.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is better than playing the real machines. I can't stop. I got everyone hooked. Great family fun. If you do it right you never have to buy coins.

B00BOXZAG6|4.0|I do tend to gravitate toward stylish movies. Terry Gilliam, Marc Caro/Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Guillermo del Toro will always be among my favorite directors. So, when I heard \\"Upside Down\\" was a real piece of work I figured....go for it. It's a mixed bag.<br /><br />Here's he scoop. You have two opposing worlds really close to one another. Each has its own gravity. The 'upper world' is the \\"haves.\\" The 'lower world' is the \\"have nots.\\" The upper world gets oil from the lower world which they turn into electricity to sell back to the lower world at exorbitant prices keeping them impoverished. Adam from the lower world falls for Eden of the upper world. Fate tears them apart only to have them meet up again years later. Can they overcome their class related predicament?<br /><br />This is not unlike Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" in that you have true love trying to be found in the midst of a repressive socio-political environment. It also can be seen as an indictment on the class widening in the U.S. as well as the west's siphoning of oil from the mid-east where all but the elite live in abject poverty. This is a great looking film to be sure. Great production design and color palette. This has style to the 9s. The cast is good as well. Kirsten Dunst, as Eden, is always likable and they paired her with Jim Sturgess (Adam) who might be a bit too cute and in need of a better hair stylist. But he, also, is likable. You want these two to make it. The problem here is the script. It's not at all a bad idea. It just needed punching up. Certain turns in the story needed more umph and it just wasn't there. And Dunst reveals something in a later scene which was out of the blue for me. Was something in the script that was left on the editing floor to lead up to this point or was it left out of the script entirely? Either way it was a screw up.<br /><br />This is a really decent watch. Were it that bit better I'd consider a space for it in my library. As it stands, one viewing is enough for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I chose this book as host for our September book club. Everyone loved the book and we had a lively discussion of the relationships and what we would have done if we were the characters. Loved the Epilogue.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds only better. I really love the different birds in this version! SOOOOO FUN!  I was so happy to get this ad free version too.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|KThis is a really good game. Good graphics, good storyline, and nicely creepy. Good for Halloween, but I would not recommend it for youngsters, however. Might be a little too scary.<br />.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Only been playing for a few days. It's very cute but beware of  the treasure chest. It said open for 925 sand dollars and I only got 125 sand dollars as a prize. Not much of a prize at all. Granted it's a free game and didn't cost be any thing but my time spent earning them. Over all its fun and colorful for Nemo fans.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book and I can't wait till the seconds movie comes out . November 22 needs to hurt up
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I've heard so much about this book that I broke down and bought a copy on Kindle.  Seriously, I really don't see the hype.  Some of the sex scenes were erotic and there were many witty and genuine phrases, but the rest of the story/plot was so redundant and ever so long. There wasn't much going on.  And what's up with the names: Grey, Greene, Steele? Do they represent the fifty shades as well?  I've read many books similar but much shorter.  They don't bore you out like this one.  It could have been written half the length. I can't imagine reading the second and third book.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|O my it works so well I think it does if you guys like it or hate it your choice but I love LOVE LOVE !!!
B00FCDPNES|5.0|Excellent edition of Oscar Wilde's classic novel about art, vanity, growing old, and love. Poor old wilde he had it all but victorian morals ruined him.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|When I heard about it a magazine I thought I should get it cause I had a project coming up and I thought I could use it. At first I didn't get how to use it and their blot didn't help me at all. I ended up going on answers.com and it taught me how to use it but it was really frustrating. Then I got skitch,  and had some trouble figuring it out same thing. but they dont totally work together because I try to add a skitch note into another part of evermore but it wont let me! but once you figure it out and learn the basics there is a lot you can do with it and its really helpful.

B008E374PO|5.0|I bought this album last spring because my older son was part of a dance number set to \\"Shooting Star\\" and we wanted him to be able to practice at home.  (Despite being the youngest in the group, he did a great job and it still brings a tear to my eye thinking about him dancing so joyously alongside the older and more experienced dancers.  But that's beside the point.)  In the weeks leading up to the show, of course, we listened to that song in particular as well as the rest of the album a *lot*.<br /><br />Since then, we still listen to it a lot because my five-year-old has fallen in love with the music.  He sings \\"Shooting Star,\\" \\"Good Time,\\" and \\"Speed of Love\\" almost constantly.  (Previously, he was fixated on Queen, singing \\"We Are The Champions,\\" \\"Killer Queen,\\", \\"Fat Bottomed Girls,\\" and, of course, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" all the time.)  In the car, when he's tired or bored and the older two are doing their own thing, putting this on will almost guarantee a peaceful (though not a quiet) ride, with him singing along and his sister joining in.  Almost every song elicits an \\"Again!\\" when it ends; we have a strict three-times-in-a-row limit in force.<br /><br />Of course, none of that speaks to the quality of the music.  After all, a lot of people like Justin Bieber and the like.  So is this any good?  Well, he's no Vivaldi or Knopfler, but for the genre, he's pretty good and, actually, listenable.  I have a hugely diverse taste in music; my collection (thousands of CDs) includes everything from mainstream music such as classic rock, country, and bluegrass to less common stuff like West African folk/blues, classic new age/space and South African a Capella.  These days, mostly, I listen primarily to classical, especially baroque.  So, on the one hand, that I like this is not all that surprising but, on the other, music needs to be pretty good (regardless of the genre) for me to listen to it.  This I don't mind listening to.<br /><br />So, to sum up, if you're into dance music (or if your kids are), this is pretty good.
0812550706|5.0|This great book is outstanding. I will add that when I was in the Marine Corps it was on the commandants reading list.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo Saga is a great, modern sci-fi trilogy. It's thought provoking and leaves you thinking about it long after you put it down. Unfortunately you must read all three books so if you're not into long sagas, this series may not be for you. If you don't mind getting sucked into a multi-part story, Wool and it's sequels is wonderful. Hugh Howey describes a new kind of place to live with such detail that you find yourself running up and down the 2,000 foot stairwell with the rest of the characters. You can feel and smell the place, and you begin to believe that it exists. It's very much like our acceptance of the existence of the Enterprise. It's there already, time just has to pass until we can actually see it.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I checked it out on Prime and got hooked. Don't have HBO so this was a great option to see the series. Now I'll probably have to buy episodes to see what happens with the little fellas...
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Quick and easy read. Entertaining. I watched the netflix show after reading and it is a lot different than the book!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Great actors - I love them both. Funny, dark humor, you forget they are not real brothers. Sam and Dean fight like they are real siblings. A great balance of fun, scary, dark and everyday. These Brothers are very entertaining!

B00BK5D95C|4.0|A little taste of something new & unique. Great groove & rhythm throughout. Look forward to more from Alt-J in the future.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book. I don't consider it pornographic but more erotic. You hate Christian Grey at the beginning but then you fall in love with him and want a man like him by the end of the book. Ana changes him from a man that only cares about his own needs to caring about someone else and wanting the best for them. I hate this woman that causes him to be this way. But, his love for Ana changes his life. Looks as though there might be room left for a sequel to show all about his childhood and his growing into a man and how this woman managed to ensnare him into the life that he was leading before he met Ana.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I may the decision not to pre listen to the record before it came out. Chers amazing new record is like 2 pieces of great pie. one is the dance side and one is the ballads. Cher soars on the ballads. I really love the amazing sirens and I hope u find it. also the deluxe version has the great ballad u haven't seen the last of me. if u haven't seen burlesque yet go ahead and do so. the part where cher sings this amazing song is worth the price of the movie. I can't wait to see this diva back out on tour. I have seen cher 3 times and they were great nights. Buy the deluxe version. the extra tracks make it worth it.
B0036EH40Q|3.0|The quality was great no issues there, but the Blu-ray is the original release and not the extended cut that was released on DVD which gave the movies and its characters more depth. recommend buying the extended DVD or wait for a &#34;remastered&#34; blu-ray in the future.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This was a very quiet kind of game with no scarey bits and no hurried feeling. I never felt excited about what might happen next. Game play was straightforward and simple. I played in casual mode. I was not pestered with pleas to rate the game. For the money I feel it was too short. There is no bonus content. The English as written was flawed, obviously not written by someone whose native language is English. The story was uncomplicated. They should reduce the price.
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|I think the book was just amazing it used just the right amount of detail with not to much and not to little. It was exciting I felt like I was in it, i felt like I was Jared it kept my hooked from the first chapter. The movie doesn't even come close. It was just outstanding, extraordinary, and amazing.
B007EECSFA|2.0|Pickings were slim at the airport newsstand when I finished the book I'd brought on a business trip, so I chose  Australian author Kate Morton's \\"The Secret Keeper.\\" I'd never heard of Morton but apparently she's developed quite a devoted following.<br /><br />In 1961, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson, hiding in a treehouse, watched her mother Dorothy set her infant son Gerry down on the front walk and stab to death a man who was approaching the family house in rural England.  Based partly on Laurel's statement to the police, Dorothy was found to have acted in self-defense in response to the man's attack. The family went on about its business, but Laurel did not really see the man attack Dorothy. She has held her tongue and wondered for decades. Now it's 2011. Dorothy is near death. Laurel decides to find out why her gentle, loving, inventive mother would have stepped so far out of character and killed that man. Her investigation leads her back to Dorothy's life in London during the 1941 Blitz. After the initial set-up, the story shifts back and forth between 1941 and 2011 as Laurel, with some help from Gerry, digs through family belongings and archival material to figure out why Dorothy did what she did.<br /><br />It's a reasonably intriguing mystery. Morton's evocation of World War II London is lively enough, and in several scenes of elder care, she shows the challenge and heartbreak that can be involved for the caregivers without undermining the dignity of the elderly. Unfortunately, other than Dorothy and her Blitz-era friend Vivien, the characters are pretty much stock types or barely there, with details such as Laurel's being a famous and award-winning actress not really helping us understand them as people. Laurel is little more than a stand-in for the curious reader. The plot depends almost entirely on implausible coincidence. The book feels padded with repetitive and unnecessary scenes. The writing was not noticeably bad, but neither was it noticeably good. I finished, but if I had misplaced it before reaching the end, I wouldn't have bothered to get another copy.<br /><br />Other than the cartons of cigarettes the characters smoke, this is quite a chaste book. If you like books with  World War II settings, lack graphic sex or violence, only mild swearing, and an ending geared to please an audience, you'd probably like this. I found it overly sweet and bland for my taste.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Got it up and running with no issues.  Works great with Netflix and Youtube.  Hopefully support for other services expands.
B000UEDTUE|5.0|I'm just a hobby-level artist trying to branch to different media. I prefer sketching and charcoal but have wanted to try out watercoloring and these pencils seemed to be a logical progression.<br /><br />I'm no expert by any means but will try to point out the best qualities of these pencils.<br /><br />First off is that the colors are incredibly vibrant and look amazing on paper. The pigment completely dissolves when a wet brush is applied and the pigment can be pulled from the pencils themselves using a brush and applied directly to the paper. Obviously you can use them dry and they react like soft core colored pencils. If you use a wet application after though you can't tell pencil was used as the colors are completely dissolved. The colors are permanent though once dried which is great because it allows for more layering.<br /><br />I sharpened them by hand to expose roughly twice as much of the cores then with a traditional sharpener so I can use them for burnishing easier and also to pull color from the core using a brush directly. The cores are holding up incredibly well, I have no fear of them breaking even with almost a full inch exposed.<br /><br />Another small note worth mentioning is the quality of wood used as well was apparent to me when sharpening. The wood actually cut away and was soft enough that it wasn't a huge hassle to sharpen all 36 of them by hand. A small point obviously but I felt worth mentioning.<br /><br />The case itself is nice, I chose this over the tin to shave a couple bucks off and I liked how the gift box looked. The flap that opens also has a magnet in it to shut the box together and can be used as a stand.<br /><br />The only downside is of course lack of colors. Not that the set is lacking per se but some colors are missing. Examples are lack of flesh tones, greys and browns. Jerry's Artrama supply (spelling) here on Amazon sells the individual pencils as well but you'll need to do a bit of searching to find them. I'm supplementing this set with about 20 pinks, browns, fleshes and greys.<br /><br />I'll be adding some pictures soon. Need to paint some examples and also waiting on a paper block to be delivered.<br /><br />If you want actual artist quality watercolor pencils then the Albrecht Durer line is what you want. They're fantastic.enting this set with about 20 pinks, browns, fleshes and greys.<br /><br />I'll be adding some pictures soon.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! The story entwines the lives of  three women, all in crisis. The unexpected twists and turns keep you wanting to read more and more. I was sorry when it ended.
0441018866|5.0|This is my favorite of Reynold's books.  The scope is immense and the time period is vast.  His characters are complex and human.  Even though his characters are not deeply flawed, they are realistic and believable and can be understood and empathized with.<br /><br />The various concepts that Reynolds comes up with are things that make me think about his books long after I am done reading them.  The novella Diamond Dogs is one of those, where I read it at least two years ago, but still think about it because it was plausible and dark and intriguing.  In this book, the machine intelligences were very thought-provoking.<br /><br />It is hard to write about the story because the story was so vast and had so many interesting points.  The Spirit of the Air was immensely intriguing.  So was Hesperus, of the Machine People.  And the suspicion and intrigue swirling around the ambush of the Line kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />Alastair Reynolds is simply the best science fiction writer working today.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Clothing was great, setting good.  Acting, excellent, but what else do you expect from Dicaprio!!!<br />I liked the twist the story took from the other movie from several years ago
1451648537|4.0|This book is well written and authentic. Biographies teach us what we should learn from others rather than experiencing it ourselves.<br />The best part of the reading was the thrill of seeing how the products are developed which are/were part of our daily life.  I was driven to read chapters timed in our history in order from IPOD, to IPHONE, and then to IPAD. Sorry I am little too young to witness the Mackintosh revolution.<br />  The competition with top vendors/products, classy marketing, laser focus on development from start to finish, user experience, knowing what end user wants, no manuals, driving engineers to deliver, surround yourself with `A' grade people, marriage of Art and Engineering, and deep collaboration between all groups are some of the lessons we could drive.<br />And best of all<br /><br />\\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\"
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's been a while since a book moved me the way this one did. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone that hasn't read the book, but it's incredible emotional and makes you put life and its twists and turns into perspective. I highly recommend this book!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was great. I haven't seen any good magic tricks in a long time and this movies had some blow your mind tricks. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. And the end is a shocker, I never would have guessed. I usually will watch a movie before I buy it and this one will be in my movie library to be watched over and over again.
B00F91H666|1.0|We decided to watch a movie last night for a change.  There was nothing in the brief description saying that it was a zombie movie.  Lame, pathetic waste of 5 dollars.  Stopped watching in the first 10 minutes.  Wish there was a way to get my $$ back!!

B00F8L2VO4|4.0|When i got the app i thought this was going to be some avarege app that would only teach you to say hello and goodbye in several languages, however, i have to say i was pleasently surprised.<br />If you expect to be fluent at whatever language it is you are trying to learn by the time you are finished with this app this probably isn't for you, but i asure you that you will at least be able to convey ideas pretty well and  i think that's an awesome thing to get from a free app.
B009IH0ICG|3.0|I bought a small 14\\" diameter charcoal grill at the beginning of the summer. I thought this would be of sufficient size for the small grill; it can contain just barely enough charcoal for the 14\\" size. Overall, it's a well made product. However, I would not recommend this unless you need a small starter for travel camping or tailgating. Instead, I recommend the larger size that Weber makes for typical backyard use.<br /><br />Update: I measured the number of coals I can put into the 7447 compact rapidfire chimney starter. approximately 35 briquets will fit in. You can pile them up a little higher, but those coals will smoke for a while. The larger (non-compact) 7416 Weber rapidfire chimney starter holds 90+ briquets.

1452126577|4.0|It looks like an excersise book in small format, in hard cover, and has a lot of grumpiness inside, including photos, drawings, tutorials on how to be grumpy... even a timeline of grumpiness.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|The author has created a very rich fantasy world filled with interesting characters and a complex story filled with unexpected twists and turns.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|One of my favorites since I was a kid. It even has some Beetlejuice cartoons from back when Saturday morning cartoons ruled my world. The case came a bit cracked, but the dvd is fine. Not going to knock stars for that. This movie is great. I shouldn't even have to write a review.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have read almost everything that I could have gotten my hands on regarding comparative religion . . . especially those arising out of the Mediterranean - While there wasn't much new here (for me) - the author does bring a unique voice and vision to how Paul of Tarus forged the religion we now refer to as Christianity.  A belief system that had little to do with the mission that Jesus of Narazus was attempting to accomplish in Roman occupied Judea.  Definitely a must read if you haven't considered looking at the time and lives of the Jews during the first century occupation.  However, be prepared to think long and hard about preconceived 'truths' that have been served up by centuries of reinterpretation and  rewritten history.  Ones that you may hold to be Creed.
B00ECKKCRK|3.0|I had the privilege of seeing BLS at the Masquerade in Atlanta two years ago. It was amazing, energy packed and worth every penny. Unlike this album.<br /><br /> There are sweet moments here. The opener \\"Losin' Your Mind\\" is strong. \\"The Blessed Hellride\\" isn't bad, though Zakk hits some rough notes singing it. \\"Sold My Soul\\" has a burner of a solo and \\"The Road Back Home\\" isn't bad. But, it goes south after that. The more prominent the piano becomes the less energy the guitar solos have and by the end, you're left wondering what happened?<br /><br /> The bonus material varies from horrid (Zakk does Bill Withers and Leon Russell...shudder) to meh. The album never truly becomes an unplugged adventure but definitely is too toned down for my metal lust.<br /><br />  I would save the $12 and wait for BLS to come to town, but only if Zakk has this wimpifying illness out of his system and is ready to give us the BLS we all learned to love.
B00CCEHW6W|4.0|I think this band can best be described as US black metal with a touch of shoe gaze.  This is Deafheaven's second full length and it doesn't disappoint.  While the tracks on the album are longer sans the few interludes, they certainly don't feel like it.  The best part about this band is they are as good on record as they are live.  Definitely a solid release that I would recommend to anyone who likes faster, thrashier, black metal influenced tunes.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|If you don't know the answer to this question, you need to read this book. As the first snow falls and the town's kids are afflicted with a cold, the town is faced with \\"troubles ahead.\\" It's Snow Alligators vs. Snowmen that the kids need to build. The fierce and tall Snowmen need to scare off and keep away the Snow Alligators, just like scarecrows keep away pests from a garden.<br /><br />But the kids are sick and cannot go outside. So, in the absence of Snowmen, Snow Alligators are taking over: the mailman steps on their tails, the town's inhabitants try  hard to escape and not end up in \\"Snow Alligator's stew.\\" Despite the cold weather, things are heating up in this delightful book. Forts are being build, defenders are on a vigil, and the whole town is on alert.<br /><br />So what caused all this chaos? It was the violation of one of the main rules of winter: Snowmen must be build with the first winter snow. Point well-taken. Time to finish the review and get busy. A really fun book!!
B00DVT54RQ|5.0|I was really excited when it was announced this album was being reissued on vinyl.  I believe the first 2,000 copies were done on gold and then the rest on black.  I unfortunately wasn't lucky enough to get the gold pressing but in the end it doesn't really matter.  This album is a shining moment of why Faith No More was and always will be the best at what they do/did.  This album has a little bit of soul, a little bit of metal, a little bit of funk; hell, it has a little bit of everything and that's what makes it 100% awesome.  If you don't have this in your rotation I suggest you buy it immediately or your ears will regret your brains poor decision.
1607066017|5.0|Well, a &#34;grown-up&#34; comic book, with characters I can identify with!  Great artwork, good story.  The couple depicted is the first &#34;balanced&#34; couple that I've ever read about in a comic book (i.e., NOT tortured Peter Parker or Clark Kent B.S.).  Enjoy!
B00CDUVDEC|2.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when this album came out but knowing that Phil wrote everything and picked a band to play the music I had reasonably high hopes.  Having liked every other project he's been in it seemed like it would be a total win.  Wrong!  There is nothing that stands out on this album and after listening to it a few times it's less than memorable.  It seems like an experimental metal album of sorts which could be awesome but this one isn't executed well at all.  I really don't have anything positive to say about this other than I wouldn't recommend it because there are a bunch of better albums that have been released in 2013 to spend money on.  Pass.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is the worst book I've read in a long time. The plot is infantile and completely unbelievable and the characters are so shallow and illogical it can scarcely be credited. After about 30 pages I started to feel ashamed on behalf of the adult writer who had created this garbage and even more on behalf of the editor who decided to publish it. Possibly my five year old son would appreciate the plot, but I can't believe anyone else would. I wouldn't allow him to read it though, because I prefer he be exposed to literature.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really great book, riveting storyline, fast paced, enthralling, scary, everything you'd expect from a sequel to The Shining. I hope this makes it into a movie.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|First off, let me say this is unlike ANY Superman movie you have ever seen, and definitely is NOT the Superman you thought you knew. It manages to keep all the classic elements, with a new twist. Lois (Adams) is much more intelligent and independent -- she's a REAL reporter, not a damsel in distress. Pa Kent (Costner) teaches Clark (Cavill) some hard lessons in life, and leads by example. The ending is the most controversial part of the movie, and fans either love it or hate it. I personally am willing to accept it as a catalyst for future films and story development. I hope they never do it again, but I also hope they don't just pretend it never happened.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Amazing! This is one book I will read over and over again, definitely one of my top favorites. I would certainly recommend it.

B008BM9L72|2.0|These books were so disappointing. I really don't know what everybody was raving about? There was no storyline the characters were 2 dimensional and underdeveloped and the sex was repetitive. I felt like it was the same scene described over and over again. I really have no idea what sets these apart from the Mills and Boons. I wish I had not bought these! :(
B00DI75SWM|3.0|It was pretty good for the main part but I couldn't figure out how to save it and my poster thing would just go away. It's fun and I like it I just don't like that I can't save the poster. I don't think it was worth the ninety nine cents I spent on it. Don't get it if you want to be able top save it.

0783231202|5.0|very interesting to watch and unbelievable to watch that history of the slaves and the masters, glad the ending was better for the slaves to be free
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I am enjoying this game. I had a problem getting through one of the levels, and was determined to make it through. It's a fun game with some challenges.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Sometimes it glitches;As all games do. You lose some stuff but if you set it up right you will recover the loss quickly. The dinosaurs are cool too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was very surprised what the secret was and how soon it was revealed.  I had to keep reading<br />to find out how they dealt with it.  The ending was  great.  Never even quessed it would be that way.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|The movie was not that good, but the quality was very bad.  This is the first time this has happened but it better not keep on happening or I'll stream from another service.<br /><br />  R.H Jeanes
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|KING is back and top of form. To say that I couldn't put \\"Doc\\" down is so cliche but....  From the very beginning, and I mean right from his dedication to the fantastic Warren Z., I was firmly planted and not to be disturbed until the ending. No one else keeps me up past 3 a.m. unable to put down what they've written. I am so grateful for the many hours of deliciously engrossing Stephan King books and hope my love of reading his work is only matched by his desire to continue writting!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very enjoyable movie with a great plot. I'm surprised it didn't do better at the box office. I would watch it again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|When I saw that Brad Pitt was to be the leading actor I figured the movie would be chock full of P.C. bull blaming probably former President Bush for yet some other catastrophe despite the fact the mans been out of office for half a decade.<br />What I found was a thrill ride of a movie featuring probably my favorite theme, \\"Zombies\\". There was no blatant political correctness and in fact if anything the military was shown in a positive light. Though Mr. Pitt may be the first and only U.N. employee to ever accomplish anything his heroics sure did a lot of bacon saving in this movie.<br />In short I'm glad to see Mr. Pitt in something non melodramatic for a change or cast in some idiotic love-comedy. Oh, and there was probably the worst movie I have ever seen that Mr. Pitt was a lead actor in that also featured Kate Blanchette.......cannot think of the name of the dreadful movie but what almost became an international incident came down to be caused by two Middle Eastern children stupidly playing with a gun and accidentally shooting the usually very talented Ms Blanchette....on a bus....going somewhere for some reason....I think it was a tourist related trip (though why anyone would choose to take a bus ride through the lunar terrain of that part of the world escapes me, perhaps it was just to get out in the world and eat left handed while your wife gets treated like a dog).<br />Back to this movie. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was too short. It was so much fun I could have gone another hour without even thinking about it running too long. Great fun, well done in every way and from what I have heard the entire movie was all accomplished by the efforts of Mr. Pitt. So, despite the fact that we probably agree on nothing politically my hat is off to you Mr. Pitt and thank you for the entertaining and VERY exciting movie!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought this stylus based on previous customer reviews.  I really love it and it makes using the keyboard and other functions on my Kindle Fire so much easier.  I wasn't able to just use my fingertips to type.  I kept getting the wrong letters or numbers.  This makes it a breeze.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|My boyfriend was an extra in this movie, we just watched it, and now he's ashamed of himself. Well done.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|wow searched high and low to rent this movie didn't last long in the the theatres. Forced to buy it but loyal Will smith fan and more importantly sci fi lover. Both actors were awesome in there roles direction was what was lacking in this movie not a whole lot of range of emotion allowed for the father character. They could have used less flashback to the daughter dying and more encounters with different species on the old earth. Jaden is a natural on camera. I hope the undeserved, unexplained, pariah status of this movie does not dampen his desire to be a force of reckoning in the movie industry. My thanks to Will for staying on the cutting edge and bringing something fresh  to the screen.
0061537934|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Everyone who loves dogs will understand Enzo (the dog) and enjoy this story as viewed from the eys and mind of the dog.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I played the free version for a long time.  Not sure what the difference is between the free and this version, but they are both equally fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Did not disappoint. Well done Mr.King. This book really captures the imagination and leaves you satisfied. Reading The Shining was an awesome experience as a child and reading this book as an adult is very gratifying.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|Modern Family is such a funny show.  I like how they have taken a family and given 3 different aspects on how family life is.  Don't want to give away to much of the story but I really enjoy all the actors and actresses.  If I am not mistaken I believe the show won an Emmy again this year for best Comedy but not 100% sure because I don't want the Emmys.
0316201561|5.0|My 2 kids, both my 6 year old and my 9 year old both loved this book so we also bought the 2nd book
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is my favorite comedy on television.  I own all 6 seasons and each time I watch an episode I pick up something I missed from the original airing.  Great cast, great writing equals a great TV show.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|In the movie Bambi, the little rabbit says &#34;If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all&#34;.  End of review
B009NH6JRE|5.0|In my opinion this is the best show on TV.  Sometimes the storyline seems to drag but there are so many characters that I think the writers did a very good job because of that.  I also love how many &#34;walkers&#34; get shot each episode and then add in the human versus human element and it makes for good viewing, at least for me.  I don't want to give away to much of the plot lines that is why I am not being more specific.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found this book a little boring and slow to read. Ana has already disarmed Christain and become the center of his universe. There is nothing more to the storyline. I expected hot and heavy and was quite disappointed. I  wanted to be drawn into more of Christian's dark world instead of getting dragged along while Ana brought him into the light of her innocence. The repetitive phrasing and narrow vocabulary used made the book very predictable and even in the sex scenes regardless if they took place in the bedroom, the tub, an airplane or anywhere else, I wasn't surprised or intrigued by what was happening. I expected so much more from this book!
B00FF56IR4|5.0|After watching episode 3: I should never doubt Mr. Whedon. The series is really starting to roll. The reason I didn't recognize the names in the first episodes is that he is creating his own superheros (and maybe villans!). Episode 3 had me laughing in guilty expectation of some really cool stuff. Watch this series and give it a chance, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />(After watching episode 2: Episode two gives the series another star in the rating. My hopes are high. This series has great pacing and obviously allot of money invested in it. The cool thing is that Joss Whedon has the habit of making characters that have allot of hidden abilities/talents which reveal themselves over time. Also, funded by Marvel, Joss may have been given a go ahead for the entire year, where he doesn't have to worry about some idiots cancelling his series (Firefly). This second episode got my hopes up even more and I just have a feeling its going to be one of his great ones<br /><br />My post-episode musings: I still think the name dropping was overdone, but I have very high hopes for this series. With Joss directing, I think its going to be great!)<br /><br />(After watching episode 1: With all the name dropping I imagine the Marvel - philes we're probably ejaculating with glee, however it was a bit flat for me. I don't know the personal names of all the marble superheroes so it slipped past me, I guess.<br />It seemed a very slow start, but with Joss Wheadon directing, I'm sure it will pick up. I will continue to watch the series and I'll bet it turns into something great. It just isn't there yet.)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|after update does not show up on carousel and causes other apps to go blank on  the caroousel have uninstalled several times and reinstalled and the same thing happens.
B008P9M614|5.0|I didn't need fancy, revamped packaging or loads of special features, which I saw some reviewers had complained about. Just give me every glorious episode, all in one place. Pretty cheap here on amazon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. Some harder levels look easy to accomplish, but you might get stuck for a minute. It's easy for me to lose time sometimes when I play this because it very addicting. My neighbor turned me on to it and I have surpassed him in levels now. Very fun
B001OFPKTG|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter. She loves to read and was very happy when she received this bood for Christmas.
0061950726|5.0|I do like to read books that  have some History connection.  And originally coming from Minnesota,  I can relate .
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It is very fun too play , it is a lot like a game I play on. Facebook.. I will tell my friends about it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Splendid acting with a somewhat decent screenplay, though not completely believable.  A creditable job from Hoffman as director. The musical backstory truly makes it worth a viewer's attention.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Great show.  The writers and director/s just grab your attention and with attention to details.  The actors bring it to life and hold your attention.
0425267695|5.0|I bought this on a whim.  At about page 2, I was hooked.  Like other reviewers, I found it almost impossible to put down.  Ryan has conceived, and portrayed, a complex, fascinating world.  The characters all have depth.  It is more than simply sword-fighting.  It is about love, and friendship, and loyalty...and betrayal.  The religous aspects are well thought out and real enough.  No Hobbits or Saurons here.  I would find myself breathless after reading some passages.  It works very well as a standalone, but clearly there are more avenues to be explored.  I can hardly wait for book 2 in this series.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Was not sure if I would be interested until I started to view the first 20 minutes if the first show,  I got hooked on this wonderful program.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Very good product. Shipping was very fast and I am happy with the product. Thank you very much for the fast shipping.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The imagination and magic into this show just keeps you on your seat wanting more and not to end.  Just magical!
B001NYTXLO|5.0|It is always worth the money to buy a best hits album and this one proves it. So many great songs!
B000MAH5O2|1.0|It's judt impossible to not laugh (or cry) when reading Mr. Obama state something he hates, than be a complete hypocrite in the nec paragraph. Apparently, it's not applicable to attacks on Republicans or whining constantly about President Bush.<br /><br />Pethaps your next autobiography should be formatted as a graphic novel, so you can be the hero you believe yourself to be. There's your shovel ready job!
0451204530|2.0|Perhaps it is because I figured out who spy #2 was half way through the book that I was disappointed with this Follett effort and I'm not that astute. Plus the ending was truly lame. Our super smart hero must have had a brain cramp. And why is it that heroes always prevents a huge disaster when there is only a second or two \\"left on the clock\\". Pleeeze, stop with the contrived manipulations of your readers. Furthermore, why is it that the authors of these types of stories always include the key women as being not just highly intelligent but also gorgeous with Playboy Playmate bodies. Follett's inclusion of the sexual escapades is nothing short of the apparent obligatory gratuitous sex. That his lead character who is under intense pressure with limited time and in danger of losing his life, still is able to have fantasies about having sex with his beautiful female companion. These inane digressions only detract from the flow. This book's plot had great potential. Too bad it failed to deliver.
0316153834|5.0|Another good job.  Book in excellent condition, and received early.  I would recommend this company.  This is also a good book.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Incredible well written series.  Enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.  Highly recommend for readers of all ages.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought it when I got my Kindle fire and haven't taken it off since. Works great, I'm constantly using my kindle to read recipes or watch Netflix while in the kitchen or while I'm doing random chores. The built-in stand really makes it. I think the first thing that will die on this is the elastic, but I've had the fire for over a year and the case is still going strong.

B00F91H15W|1.0|Stupid rich kids stealing from other stupid celebrity rich kids. Frustrating to watch. I saw this story unfold back when it happened and not very accurate on the timelines from what I could tell. And the characters COMPLETELY  miscast not even close to a resemblance.... Hard to watch. And any one that gets their house broken into 8 times and dosent know it deserves it. It's like watching dumb and dumber but not funny.
B00DYVU9K8|4.0|I don't really understand why a lot of people were disappointed and expected more from the characters. They are shallow people doing bad things. How do you expect them to be \\"deep\\" and develop throughout the movie? I knew right off the bat, that this movie is a social commentary/satire, not unlike the genius Spring Breakers, which many people just didn't understand either. It was made to be over the top and subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) criticize the life style of these characters. The clothes they wear, the things they say and how they say it, their priorities, their selfishness, etc. I mainly picked this up because I love Emma Watson. I mean, who doesn't? She was great in all the Harry Potter movies and she blew me away in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. In this movie, she played a heartless, vain b**** very well. I thought she was brilliant. Everyone else did a good job as well, but Emma Watson being, you know, Emma Watson, just radiates star power, so she stole the movie in every scene she acted in. This movie is very 'this is how it starts, and this is how it inevitably, OBVIOUSLY, ends'. Even if you don't know anything about the true story, you know right away that their ending is not a happy ending. I suppose, the only character you can care about is the male lead. He was probably the one character to express remorse or reluctance to what they were doing, but that doesn't mean he didn't enjoy some of his time in his thievery with his girlfriends. He did partake in it and he did deserve what he got. Although I did feel bad, even though it was totally expected, when s*** hit the fan, his almost-like-a-sister \\"best friend\\" back stabbed him. Like I said, this movie is about shallow people. You go in knowing that, then you won't be disappointed. Trust me, you're not going to be awed or moved by this movie. It's very simple and well done. It did its job. I praise all the actors for their wonderful acting and I highly praise the director for her wonderful directing. It was a very beautiful looking film, riddled with beautiful looking people, who clearly are not so beautiful underneath. This kind of movie makes me very happy I did not grow up with that lifestyle. I have a heart. I'm caring and very appreciative. These people... yeah... not so much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super duper awesome I really love It and it's lots of fun often andy friends play at the same time to see who the furthest run.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|So i bought this cd today, the special edition, and spun it a couple times on a long drive. Of course i had already heard the two songs already out, 'the enemy inside' and 'along for the ride' and liked them enough... Nothing surprising, it's what i expect from dream theater... Solid prog metal.<br /> I have even read a few reviews from fans commenting specifically on the keyboard solo on 'along for the ride' as being a goofy sounding keyboard patch. I think it is perfect, you have to be an old school prog guy to realize the sound is kind of an homage to the prog greats from the 70's...<br /> But again, on cd in my car i was happy. Not blown away, just happy. It was what i expected...<br /> But tonight i put the dvd in my home theater system...<br /> Good gravy was this a good purchase. This mix sounds so good! I am listening at relatively low volume, as my wife and three year old are sleeping, but i am grinning like an idiot. What an aural treat! I look forward to listening to this all weekend in my wife's kid friendly suv, with it's dvd player for the kids and selectable source for sound, in 5.1...<br /> I think the drum sound is very cool. It's tight and warm. Very punchy, and man can mr magnini play. This band is sounding rejuvenated since new guy mike came to play. And of course everyone else plays well as usual...<br /> Dream theater albums are hit and miss for me. Every second or third one i'll love, and this one falls squarely into that category... I'm sure i'll feel differently after this album is really 'in my brain', but i feel very confident that it will be in heavy rotation for awhile, especially on dvd-a. Thank you dream theater for this awesome treat...<br /> The recording is killer. The sounds are crunchy and lush. The bass tone is GREAT.<br /> BUY THE DVD-A VERSION! You'll be glad you did...<br /><br /> As a side note, there is no menu or visuals on the dvd, i find that odd. I own several dvd-a albums, mostly porcupine tree or steven wilson solo stuff... All of them have menus and simple photo albums for visuals, at least. It just struck me as odd to not even have the album cover or SOMETHING on my tv screen. But it's a minor complaint. It really sounds awesome... I am still smiling like an idiot...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It's fun, and it makes me think. Besides all the apps that pop up, it's great for putting your brain to work.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Once experienced in true life, the book will always open the heart to those feelings again! I love it, my wife is going through it now and it's too painful for her to read to our children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very awesome game it is so cool that I played it on the toilet<br />cool awesome
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I felt like I knew these people by the time I was finished. I recently visited the largest privately owned home in the US. It is the Biltmore House in Ashville NC. It seemed I had more insight into the kind of lifestyle they lived after seeing Downton Abbey.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Took a good day or two for it to kick in working on my Retina macbook Pro but it works flawlessly on my college ethernet network.  On www.speedtest.net I'm pulling 98 MBPS and uploading somewhere around 60. Great for a macbook air or retina
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Amazon should stop selling it. In Europe they did! Let's all send it back and ask for a refund .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good book, but the ending was a little abrupt. If you're looking for entertainment with just a little bit of thought provoking social commentary, this is it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would like to purchase the full game instead of the free version which is great to get a feel for the game. I think it's a good challenge for the brain as we age! I do enjoy the game even though I get mad and make mistakes, but who lives in a glass house???
B003KRJNBW|4.0|It is just one of those Bible stories that are believable or want to be believable.<br />Seems real like and is easy to join into the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very fun to play. The app works very well and new updates keep the game interesting and new.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It worked on my very powerful Dell Inspiron 9400 laptop, once.  I could cast all screens to my Sony HD.  I did not put it to full use until a month later.  Google changed their specs.  I can only get full HD on their &#34;approved &#34; providers, and only on my gaming desktop.  It will not work on Amazon Prime, or any device with the Android operating system. It is totally controlled by Chrome operating system and their software that Google may change at will.  I will not accept my content to be censored by Google for any reason.  There are much better ways to display streaming content on the HD TV of your choice.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Didn't realize the 'Z' meant zombies which I am not fond of.  These mindless, mostly violent gory movies seem to be popular and profitable.  I don't get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love It!!! This is a really good book. It took a minute for me to get into it but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.<br />Really Good Book!!!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Interesting, well written biography.  Worth the time spent reading it.  It was my first Kindle read on the iPad and it worked great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not usually a sci fi type reader but this story grabbed my attention from just the summary description so I downloaded it. I haven't been able to put my Kindle down since starting the book. I really enjoyed the characters and the ideas put forth about what it means to be alive...why we exist, be it in a silo or in reality. There's not only action and suspense but lots of existential questions the characters raise as they become less ignorant about their world.  I'll be getting the next book in the series as soon as I'm done with this review.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|Try getting the actual Youtube app. It'll be much better to have than just a downloading your favorite videos, y'know?
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good app, lots to discover, and its free, what more could you want. Just need to be a little patient if you run out of coins etc..
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I don't love this season quite yet, but it's still early. I really don't like that Sam never bothered looking for his brother, but I have yet to reach the halfway point to this season, so....perhaps more surprises are on their way.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Always been a Star Trek fan. So what’s next?  (&#34;11 more words required&#34; this is why I don't review like I used to)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Wanted to read this before the movie....sadly the movie didn't last long in theatres<br />but I still decided to read the book as rarely I'll go back and do so after I've seen<br />the movie.  Read this in a week on and off with my busy schedule...and it was a very good read.<br />Although have to admit, it was more fun imagining the 'cast' of the movie in the parts...got the audio too which wasn't too bad.  This is not Hunger Games...but...she is a much better writer than S. Meyers and thankfully has a much better editor than the terrible Twilight books.  Finally found the movie in a local theatre...it was one that you really needed to read the book first to fill in all the blanks.  I found the movie to be a bit disjointed at times...but all in all not as bad as I had expected from some reviews. Will definitely buy the movie when it comes out on Amazon Streaming..I would watch several times again... the cast was perfect. Even though I've heard talks that they man can doing City of Ashes etc. I hope they continue to do the next movie as the books are really<br />fun to read.
1416595236|2.0|I will keep the review short.  I have read \\"all\\" Vince Flynn's books.  Some are better than others but always good.  I was disappointed in this book due to 1 - Mitch Rapp is getting worn out and too God like.  2 - Story line is not the best and not very believable, 3 - The book ending after a lot of things going on ends in a few pages.  It like Vince got tired of writing and just decided its now over.
0786939532|5.0|This is the first RA Salvatore book I have read and I would totally recommend it if you are a fan of fantasy novels. The main character, Drizzt is a total Bada**
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I never wanted to put it down. It was chapter afyer chapter of non stop goodness.
B009LDD590|4.0|Cool show. Good character development. A little slow for some people but I thoroughly enjoyed all the dialogue. I did enjoy the first two seasons more however.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you're looking to improve your life, purchase this book. If you want to improve your relationships, purchase this book. If you want more money, purchase this book.<br /><br />You know what? Stop reading this review and just purchase the book! You'll thank me later!
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|On my 5th listen so far and loving this one more every spin. The 5.1 dvd audio mix in 96/24 is to die for! Musically, it is just mind blowing, lyrically-not so much. But, hey ,who cares? I love the instrumental tracks and Illumination Theory blows me away everytime. The surround mix is really good with some nice discrete channels and sweeping/panning drum and synths. It is well mixed and stunningly played. Almost as good as the last album, which was their best in years. This is a worthy successor that is more prog, but still has the metal flavors. A great disc!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|We have to be honest and state that this album does not reach the heights of Elton's best week.  Anybody who thinks that there is anything close to Rocket Man needs their head examined.  What he has achieved, however, is an album that is a real pleasure to listen to from beginning to end.  It's full of fantastic piano playing and strong melodies.  My only question is this.  We are told that this album was, as usual, written in three days. Why the rush?  Elton, please write a hundred songs over a period of a month or two and then pick the best ones.  Tiring for you and Bernie I know but I feel that the end result would be worth it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book kept my interest by wondering what would happen next.  Great characters keep the book lively.  Sookie' s character lea as you wanting more.<br />Enjoyed the (happy) ending.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a great game and I have a lot of fun playing. So far I have not had to spend any money playing, just patience. I gave it a 4 star because I don't like it when a game forces you to use specials when it teaches you to play.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Her knowledge of marriage and dating's dark side is uncanny. Especially on the side of the woman. Who doesn't want to be the woman that every man wants? The cool girl. But what happens when you're not pretending anymore?
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Husband loved this, it is his most favorite Stephen King movie of all times. Thank you so much for the speedy delivery and the quality movie
B001974DG0|5.0|It's always a mark of good writing when one can sympathize with the villain. There were still a few Koontz-esque eye-roll moments, but they are forgivable with such a rich story to wrap around them.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Pretty good. I'd watch it again. I thought it was well filmed and well acted. loved seeing &#34;Jaime Lannister&#34; in something else!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I use it all the time to find out how much time I have left on my Kindle or exactly how long I have  to let it charge.  Having an exact time is very helpful.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Like the game - hate all the hoops to jump through.  You have to keep going back to the same rooms to find items.  I'd enjoy  game play more if advancement was faster.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This was a good book I enjoyed it but I don't enjoy writing this review considering this is the first time I've opened it...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Wonderful read. Incredibly detailed description of characters, emotions, feelings. Everyday life made as real as your own. I'll certainly read more of her books. I hope they don't disappoint me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every bit as good as the first two seasons. It's a great way to get a history lesson and ends with a bang.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Discussing hip-hop albums is very difficult for me as my conception of it is extremely sketchy. I'm admittedly disconnected from the music,it's culture and what does come my way from it is probably mistranslated due that same strong distance from the source. When Drake first came to my attention via mainly an CD cover and one television performance involving his previous album [[ASIN:B005JLN9ZI Take Care]],it was apparent this was no shallow visual enticement. Reviewing that album bought out some unusual thoughts from me as,truth be told,it was entirely different musically and thematically than what little hip-hop I'd heard. There was a stubbornness about it,yet a clarity as well Somehow I was very much looking forward to this release which,again features extremely artful and even optimistic cover art. In the last couple of years Drake's success level has exploded. It would've been so easy for him to portray himself only in the shallowest possible terms. Instead he actually picks up where the previous album left off.<br /><br />  Musically realized by a number of multi-instrumentalists-one on each track this album starts out with a quintet of songs ranging from \\"Tuscan Leather\\",\\"Furthest Thing\\",\\"Started From The Bottom\\",\\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" and \\"Own It\\". These are instrumentally psychedelic Chill grooves-stripped down in fine hip-hop style with some wonderfully chorded and moody live piano and sped up backwards tape loops. As an MC Drake sets the stage exploring the possibilities of being a shallow rap superstar stereotype-defaming women carelessly until he realizes he is hurting the one he really loves. On \\"Worst Behavior\\",almost needless to say,this need to embrace hedonism comes to a head lyrically over a rather Egyptian/Arab style rhythm and vocal chant. On \\"From Time\\",a strong jazzy soul tone comes in with female vocalist Jhene Aiko arrives with her perspective as Drake himself reflects on the awkward elements of his family and upbringing. Featuring Majid Jordan \\"Hold On,We're Going Home\\" is a strong,more personally assured boogie funk-type number with a definite early 80's flavor and my personal favorite number on this album.<br /><br />  \\"Connect\\",\\"The Language\\" and \\"305 To My City\\" have a rather darker tone as Drake's perceived world of sex and fame begins to unravel fast. \\"Too Much\\" reaches a lyrical catharsis of it all with the weary vocals of instrumentalist Sampha expressing the title's point of view. \\"Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2\\" brings in Jay Z for what seems to be a reflection on Drake's detractors (or haters I suppose you'd call them) and for the bonus songs \\"Come Thru\\",with its grooving sensibility urges both parties in the relationship to be honest with themselves. Of course the closing number \\"All Me\\" with 2 Chains and Big Sean brings me to how I see Drake on this album. That inner struggle heard across his previous album is growing in complexity. Its a more modern day variation of the age old conflict of the classic soul/funk icon,that of the carnal and the sacred. We're in a time when hip-hop has started to take a long look at it's extreme and sometimes cliched outlook on masculinity. While Drake's story telling continues to grow even more insightful and perceptive,he seems desperate to make excessive use of stereotypical hip-hop language. Prime example is his extreme overuse of the self-pejorative \\"n*gga\\",which I don't feel belongs on this album personally-and certainly not the excesses with which its used. Aside from that (subjective) lyrical misstep,this album finds Drake continuing to establish is self questioning persona. Which I hope will serve to take the rest of hip-hop on a similar journey as he goes.Hold On,We're Going Home\\" is a strong,more personally assured boogie funk-type number with a definite early 80's flavor and my personal favorite number on this album.<br /><br />  \\"Connect\\",\\"The Language\\" and \\"305 To My City\\" have a rather darker tone as Drake's perceived world of sex and fame begins to unravel fast. \\"Too Much\\" reaches a lyrical catharsis of it all with the weary vocals of instrumentalist Sampha expressing the title's point of view. \\"Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2\\" brings in Jay Z for what seems to be a reflection on Drake's detractors (or haters I suppose you'd call them) and for the bonus songs \\"Come Thru\\",with its grooving sensibility urges both parties in the relationship to be honest with themselves.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|JUST STARTED PLAYING. IT IS A VERY FUN AND ADDICTIVE.  I THINK THIS ONE WILL TURN INTO ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Episode eight is a terrific finale.  The series showcases splendid performances by David Tennant and Olivia Colman.  Episode eight reminds one of how precious life is.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great!!!!! The game is a good way for beginning racers to  learn how to tear up asphalt!!<br />I'm learning new moves and loving it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is simple and brilliant. It's one of those perfect little \\"duh! Why didn't someone do that before?\\" ideas.<br /><br />I didn't realize I needed one until I realized that I've been chasing the idea for years. In fact, I put together a poor man's \\"AirPlay Raspberry Pi\\" Chromecast last year. By plugging my Raspberry Pi running RaspBMC into my Receiver and using it just for Airplay, I was effectively using it as a Chromecast.<br /><br />You can agree or disagree in the comments, but here's their idea - most of us don't need set-top boxes. The world's big technology companies clearly want to control the largest screen in the house. So far, that's the TV (if you own one.) If TVs go away, it'll be the largest monitor in the house. What's the best way to control this screen?<br /><br />You can get a PS3 or an Xbox. (I have both.)<br />You can get a TiVo. (check.)<br />You can get an Apple TV. (I did the XBMC Airplay thing instead.)<br />But each of these devices is a darn-near full computer with an OS, and storage, and a life and ecosystem of its own. What we really want is to use our TVs as wireless displays and use the power of our phones, tablets, and computers. Until one of the world's wireless display formats is finally declared the winner, they'll keep making set-top boxes portable computers to connect to our TVs.<br /><br />We could wait for $1000 receivers to include Wireless Display functionality, or build it into HDTVs. No! Let's make a $35 dongle that capitalizes on the fact that HDMI has finally won. It'll plug into any monitor and we suddenly that HDMI connection is available over wireless. It's open, in fact, to anyone who is on the network.<br /><br />You just plug the Chromecast into any free HDMI port and get power via micro-USB. Many TVs have a USB port that can provide this power. I used the always-on USB port from my TiVo as it was open.<br /><br />The Chromecast contains the Marvell 88DE3005 system on a chip. This integrated circuit includes hardware decoding of VP8 and H.264 codecs. Radio communication is handled by AzureWave NH-387 Wi-Fi which supports 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz). The device has 512 MB of Micron DDR3L RAM and 2 GB of flash storage. - Wikipedia<br />When you plug the Chromecast into your TV you'll connect to its initial ad-hoc wireless network and teach it about your wireless network. Then it'll reboot and jump sideways onto your network and most of your config work is done. The only way to change the Chromecast at this point is to hard reset it. The wireless setup process is very similar to other embedded wireless devices like the Nest Thermostat, FitBit Aria Scale, or Twine Wi-Fi device - connect to ad-hoc, setup locally, jump. It took all of 2 minutes.<br /><br />Ready to cast<br /><br />Here's my Chromecast plugged into my Onkyo TX-SR674 Receiver's front HDMI port.<br /><br />The Chromecast in my Receiever<br /><br />Make sure your phone's YouTube and Netflix apps are updated. They all got Chromecast support automatically last month.<br /><br />From inside the Google Chrome browser you add the Google Cast extension that lets you play content from within Chrome to the Chromecast. You can cast a browser tab to the screen and show a friend what you're browsing, which is actually very cool and useful...when it works. More on that in a second.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />When it works, it's fabulous. For example, at a recent party someone mentioned a funny YouTube video. Within 30 seconds I had it up on my iPhone, then threw it to the Chromecast. That's exactly how it should work, right?<br /><br />YouTube Casting Netflix Chromecasting<br /><br />I've thrown video to the Chromecast from all my iDevices in both the Netflix and YouTube apps. There is a hand-off and then, interestingly, the Chromecast takes over the stream. Rather than the phone or tablet pulling the content down then pushing it again laterally to the Chromecast, there's a little YouTube applet or NetFlix applet running on the Chromecast. The Chromecast inherits or hijacks the stream. All of this is transparent to the user, of course, but it's a clever implementation which allows you to close the app and do other things with your phone.<br /><br />Each app looks a little different. The YouTube iPhone app shows Views, avatars, and the date when pushed to the Chromecast.<br /><br />YouTube on a Chromecast<br /><br />Being able to use your Tablet as a remote is great. Myself, I get this functionality in three totally different ways across my devices, but the result is the same - tablets are good remotes. I have the Tivo App on my iPad, I have the Xbox Smartglass app on my iPad and Surface, and I have the YouTube and Netflix apps on my iPad talking to the Chromecast.<br /><br />HDMI-CEC is the ability for the Chromecast to automatically tell my receiver to switch to the right HDMI input when content starts playing. It would be amazing if my receiver supported it. If your system has HDMI-CEC the Chromecast will set your inputs for you and remove a step which has a high WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor or Non-Gender-Specific Spouse Acceptance Factor).<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />My computers just can't see the Chromecast anymore. They could last week. This is extremely odd considering we are all on the same wireless network and that the phones and tablets work reliably. You'll find the forums filled with people fighting with this issue. They're having to disable firewalls on MacBooks and turn off IGMP Proxies on FIOs Routers. I've done all that and while on the first day my first laptop was able to cast its Chrome Tabs to the TV, a few days later either Chrome or the Chromecast auto-updated itself and now it's just dead.<br /><br />No cast devices found<br /><br />No matter, for $35 it's a great device. It works as advertised on both iPhone, iPad and Android, although the settings for casting from iPhones are a little inconsistent and hard to find in Netflix and YouTube. The Chromecast troubleshooting should be more polished (today it's just a link to a FAQ, with no diagnostics) but since Chrome and the Chromecast both appear to be updating quite often, we should see improvements soon. If I had paid $80 or more, I would be more frustrated with my inability to use the device from my desktop and laptops, but the tablets and phones have been rock solid.<br /><br />I'd love to see the Chromecast become a more generic wireless receiver and be extended to support Apple's Airplay, as well as Miracast which is now built into Windows 8.1, and WiDi that Intel supports (although Wi-Di also supports Miracast as of WiDi 3.5). Unfortunately though, here we are again with FOUR companies each betting on a format to win while the consumer is left to pick a horse.<br /><br />Which wireless display format will become Bluray and which will become HD-DVD? It's anyone's guess. I'd like to see an open format win. However, for now, and for only $35, I'm happy with the Chromecast.<br /><br />The Chromecast is basically an impulse purchase that just happens to be the simplest, cheapest, and best solution for getting a browser window on your TV. Everything else, including the potential for app support, is secondary -- Google has a lot of work to do catching up to Apple and AirPlay on that front, and those deals aren't easy. It took Apple years to get HBO to add AirPlay support to HBO Go on the iPad, for example. History suggests that counting on Google to convince content companies to add Chromecast support to their apps is a foolish bet. And if all you want is Netflix, spend $50 on a Roku -- it's better all the way around.<br /><br />But if you're the type who routinely watches things on a laptop and just wants an easier, cleaner way to get those things on a TV, the Chromecast is a no-brainer. Think of it as a wireless display cable for your laptop and you'll get the potential immediately -- there's a reason all these companies have been trying to put a browser on TV forthe past 15 years. I have no idea if Google can build the Chromecast ecosystem into something rivals AirPlay, but for $35 I'll be too busy sending tabs from Chrome to really even care.t troubleshooting should be more polished (today it's just a link to a FAQ, with no diagnostics) but since Chrome and the Chromecast both appear to be updating quite often, we should see improvements soon.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|This book has the same format like the others from John Grisham. The main character is always outsmarted the FBI, the CIA and everyones involved to the level of unrealistic ending. I am so tired of these.<br />Duc Tran
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Was able to take videos in the swimming pool with my children. Even under water! Love it! Would def recommend especially at this price
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We really enjoy the Chromecast, it was easy to set-up and we are now constantly broadcasting web pages and YouTube videos to the TV in full HD quality.  We are looking forward to try it with full length movies next.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Watching this reminds me of growing up. Just a sit down family movie. One of those movies when flipping channels you stop and watch.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Jack dies in this movie and it's super sad, their, I just saved you 1:30 min of your time your welcome
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|Interesting application but it would not work on my device.  Couldn't find any help<br />Information information so deleted the application.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I would rate this film a &#34;B-&#34;. The special effects seemlessly created a post-apocalyptic Earth and a dystopian future that has the audience asking early on, &#34;what's going on here?&#34; While I had some suspicions about the plot line, the tale was not quite as predictable as I had thought.<br /><br />Overall, this is an engaging flick but nothing to nominate for the Oscars.
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|a great tale of betrayal and and revenge, with many unexpected twists<br />keeps you in suspense<br /><br />i loved it !
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We've used it countless times to find our way on trips.<br />Its definitely a lot easier and more helpful than Googling a place you'll be visiting and trying to figure out what results are helpful and which are not.
B009R659L8|5.0|Once again Mary Higgins Clark delivers a great mystery! I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Recommended for all who enjoy a great mystery.

B00E0SX118|5.0|Excellent family movie fun time to be had by all littlr bit of everything in this movie and alot of laughs
B008DYZKQE|5.0|The princess in this book is not concerned with the superficial aspects of being a princess.  She is a survivor who saves her prince and then dismisses him when he shows his true colors.  I got this for my grandchild so that she would have a good example to offset all the Disney princesses.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this show, they should have won an emmy award.  The sets are gorgeous and characters fasinating<br />Highly Recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first...but the book is way better.  Can't wait to read the next two books.  Really good read!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|In many ways, the hero of Doctor Sleep is not Danny Torrence, of [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]], nor is it Abra, the child he must aid but the AA program that helped both Danny and his author to function again.  For the links between the original novel and Doctor Sleep are more than returning characters or settings.  Doctor Sleep, along with the central plot, is a sermon on how the twelve-step program can revive the members willing to resist the pull of their disease.<br /><br />Both the hero and the villains of Doctor Sleep are altered by substance addiction.  Now in remission, Danny Torrence has managed to build a reasonable life but he still wrestles with his cravings and memories too shameful to be shared.  The villains, like most active users, spend most of their existence searching for their drug of choice(the life essence of children who \\"shine) and they've long become callused to the damage and heartbreak their addiction causes.  Danny must use the \\"experience, strength and hope\\" he gathered as a child of the Overlook and a recovering alcoholic to face old demons, fight these new ones and protect the new child who \\"shines\\", Abra Stone.  Like an AA sponsor with a new member, Danny uses his own memories and skills to help Abra negotiate the difficulties of a living as someone a bit different in a world full of \\"normal\\" people.  For Abra has demons as well.<br /><br />While the pacing is not as clear or as tight as [[ASIN:067102423X Bag of Bones]] or [[ASIN:1416552960 Duma Key: A Novel]] Doctor Sleep's sympathetic characters are multidimensional, sympathetic people and his bad guys have style if not souls.  The book stands well on its own as well as a sequel and King constantly annotates the text with references to ideas and characters he admires. (For example, the name of Frederika Bimmel, the first victim of Buffalo Bill in [[ASIN:0312924585 The Silence of the Lambs]] is mentioned, along with a fictional program created by Linwood Barclay).  These Easter Eggs are inside jokes from this writer who adores to read.<br /><br />So pick up the book if you like a good tale or crave comment on the human condition.  But avoid this if you're on the road.  In the Gospel of King, temporary hostels are dangerously suspect, be they resorts or modest RVs....s are inside jokes from this writer who adores to read.<br /><br />So pick up the book if you like a good tale or crave comment on the human condition.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|First time reading this author and I was very impressed.  Story drew me in quickly and I actually got a bit annoyed with my family because they kept interrupting my reading!  Great story, lots of twists and turns.  Very real portrayal of marriage and family dynamics.  Off to find her other titles!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I'm sure the ChromeCast works great when it installs correctly, but I wouldn't know because it wouldn't install. I tried several times, and followed the instructions, and annoyingly got a slightly different experience each time, but ultimately it wouldn't work. There were a couple of times it even said it had installed successfully, and would find the ChromeCast in one dialog, but then not in the next one, so I could never get it to actually stream anything. My environment is Windows 8 on a Surface Pro and an LG television. I'm used to stuff just working on the Surface Pro, so this was annoying. Was hoping to use it in hotel rooms on biz trips, but ended up returning it.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Good movie.  Anthony Hopkins brings another good character to life that will have you guessing right up until the ending.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Listened for Review (Simon & Schuster Audio)<br />Overall Rating: 4.50<br />Story Rating: 4.00<br />Character Rating: 5.00<br /><br />Audio Rating: 4.50 (Not part of the overall rating)<br /><br />First Thought when Finished: Doctor Sleep made me lose some sleep!  It was sufficiently creepy!<br /><br />Story Thoughts: Sorry to go vague again but I refuse to give spoilers for Doctor Sleep!  You really need to read this and watch it unfold to get really scared.  That is after all the point of reading Doctor Sleep.  If you are hoping to get out of this without losing sleep, I hate to tell you that it isn't probably going to happen.*  However, if you are looking for something that is totally going to \\"creep you the heck out\\" then you are in luck.  King delivered!**  I think this book probably hit all the notes it was aiming too and I really had nightmares all the way through.<br /><br />Character Thoughts:  I don't really think you are supposed to like King characters.  The heroes are always borderline narcissistic or too clean.  In this case though Stephen did manage to take them into the grey zone and still keep you on their side.  Dan is one of those characters that you want to hug, slug, and knock some sense into at times.  Abra was spunky sweet and a really good opposite for Dan. Plus, I think it was good for him to remember when he was that kid and he had help.  The True Knot was a fantastically nasty group that showed as a collective there is some real evil that could be done.  I would say overall the characters really held their own which is not always true in Stephen King's horror.<br /><br />Audio Thoughts:<br /><br />  Narrated by Will Patton / Length 18 hrs and 35 mins<br /><br />Will Patton was almost perfect for Doctor Sleep!  He had great pacing, awesome creepy voice, and could really deliver a line with precision.  I was only disappointed in his Abra voice but even then it was not distracting.  I would say listen to this book on audio, I don't think you would regret it.  As always though please listen to a sample first because not everyone has the same likes/dislikes for a narrator.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Give Doctor Sleep a whirl even if you haven't read The Shining!  I do not think you will be lost and you will be scared out of your wits.<br /><br />*You might not lose sleep if you are one of those people that deal with creepy and scary well.<br />** I am evidently in the minority on this book on thinking it was creepy.  I will say this, I have never read The Shining so I had zero per-conceived notions going into this book.  My favorite books by King are The Stand and Under the Dome.  I am a fan of his character studies and while I wasn't \\"in love\\" with any one character in Doctor Sleep, they all fit with the story.  Sometimes the smallest actions are the creepiest!would regret it.

B002NZK5RI|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised.  It was refreshing to see Sigourney Weaver in a different type of role.  She still plays a strong woman character but one that is vulnerable to her own insecurities.  I held my breath a couple of times.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a suspenseful thriller.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is loads of fun. There are always new themes to play and great prizes to win. My husband and I enjoy playing this Bingo Blitz!
B00F91H666|1.0|Terrible movie, and nothing to do with the book. Absolute waste of time and money to watch it. Rent 28 Days Later instead.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|It's light, slim and easy to attach/detach from metal clip.  Sound from this little gadget is quite clear but sometime do have echo feedback from receiver.<br /><br />Talk time is amazing.  Voice command is cool and works most of the time.  Easy pairing and auto reconnect is a plus.<br /><br />2-year warranty from manufacturer, nice.
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|Remember this movie from years back.  Enjoyed it then and really enjoyed it in the Blu-ray format.  Also, the soundtrack is exciting and very enjoyable.  Also, the story is good in addition.  Highly recommend this movie..
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've been using the app for about 3 months over Wi-Fi. Recently tried it over my lte connection and it works great. Easy to use and set up.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Less than an hour in, the movie froze twice on my Roku box, the second time causing the whole operating system to reboot. Unable to watch.

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Now you see me was a great movie that has a really great twist at the end.  I really didn't see it coming.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|24 is great and this is great ending to season 8, they need a new character if season 9...<br /><br />any other agent unless is a superhearo would be dead by now<br /><br />if you liked season 1, you will ike this ..
B00F91G5BS|5.0|WWZ was a great zombie movie.  It has a very different take on the zombie post-apocalyptic theme.  The only problem is that Brad Pitt's character is just way too lucky.
B006VREHRS|4.0|it was ok for gangster movie<br /><br />each episode is too similar though..<br /><br />almost each episde has nudity and sex, there is no need to have it,, so it is almost expected.<br /><br />the series would be better if they would just have it once in a while, instead of it being EVERY time.. no surprise or anything...<br /><br />it was ok but with some better actors, this could have been just as good as the sopranoes.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I realized a long time ago that I have terrible taste (in everything). It turns out that most of the things I like, most other people seem to like too. And...ask any \\"critic\\", if everyone likes something...in reality it must really be bad. I've only listened to this record a couple of times through, but it was immediately impressive. There are so many highlights in both songs and performance that a list of standout tracks would be exhaustive and meaningless. My initial impression: \\"Mechanical Bull\\" is KoL's most artistically competent and thematically cohesive project to date. Therefore: This album must be pure rubbish!<br />I have rated this product based solely on its individual merits...not how it relates or compares to other similar products.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I actually wasn't planning on reading this one. I'm really happy that I did. This is a fantastic book. It's so well written, the characters are really interesting, the plot is excellent, ... If you're a fan of fantasy books, you have to read this one. Even if you don't like fantasy, I think you should give this a try. It's one the best books I've ever read. Really worth the money.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Season 3 continues to be as compelling as Season 1 and 2.  Our biggest concern is getting through Season 3 on Amazon Prime and having too much time before Season 4 starts.
B009X00E18|2.0|Was hoping for a more solie cover for my 8.9.  The cover at the creases folds and bends easily.  I was attracted by the price and since I use my 7 inch most of the time, have just not bothered to replace it.  Wish that I had paid more attention to the construction. Paying a little more probably would have been worth it.

B004DM1ZQY|4.0|includes extra features like allowing real dice input and a great game to learn on since it shows you where you can move. Also allows you to turn that feature off. I recommend for the beginner or advanced player.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Loved this game for years. Recent changes make me want to quit. If it's not broke don't fix it. It's not fun when you don't win for days at a time.
B0072OFM28|5.0|What happened? This guy is not a Gladiator! He's too clean and I didn't even finish watching the first episode!<br />Okay okay. I finished it and it takes awhile for you to really get into the eisodes because of the main actor change. Very sorry to hear<br />the main character aquired cancer and passed away. My condolences to his family. Spartacus and the characters that follow throuhg in this<br />series do a great job.<br />If Gladiators and hand to hand combat is your thing with a tad of love stories this ones very good. It can get a bit racy in<br />some of the scenes though, so put the kids to bed and condition your thoght pattern a bit becauase it will test your morala a little.<br />If this is what it was like in that century then our era is pale in comparison.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The new direction JJ Abrahms has taken the Roddenberry crew is phenominal, no spoilers here but this is one star trek that I find the nemesis highly entertaining if not likeable. This is a must see if you're a trek'e and even if you're not its still a great movie! Have seen several times and keep catching some important info I missed! The movie that keeps giving!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After watching Dexter and Homeland, I needed a replacement pacifier so I ordered Breaking Bad. Man, was I really glad I did!<br />Aaron and Bryon ( two main acting characters) are off the chart GREAT! This show has got to be one of the best real to life shows on the air<br />right now. I know the Hollywood writers keep us entertained a lot but this has got to  be one of those shows that does a gear<br />shift in our thinking on what's going on in the world let alone tweak our morality a bit as to &#34;why&#34; we are watching, . .  Breaking Bad. Hahaha.<br />It's really a good series. Our backs are against the wall, we get diagnosed with a disease and we love our family. So what<br />does a good loving husband do to counter a situation that seemingly will leave his spouse and cripple son in a bad spot? He<br />steps into Haedes and ruins his life and reputation. Kind of poses a question to us all with all the fees, taxes, health reform and<br />monetary calamity we see in our society these days. Breaking Bad is a &#34;Very&#34; good show.

B00CWIMY3O|5.0|As all reviews are subjective, I ask for you to keep in mind that it is my personal opinion when I say that Hannibal is the best show on television right now.  Mads Mikkelson, Hugh Dancy, and Laurence Fishbourne are all fantastic as the primary leads, with a great supporting cast, as well as excellent writing and direction, making the show a very captivating watch.<br /><br />The audio and video quality for the blu-ray set, with the show itself already being quite good in both departments, is top-notch.  Admittedly, I was slightly disappointed that there were only two episodes with audio commentary attached, particularly since the commentary that is there is quite enjoyable, but that does not diminish the value of the set in my eyes, as it is a great price for the first season of an amazing show, and I strongly recommend it to anybody who enjoys good acting and storytelling.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the movie, and it left too many unanswered questions in my head. I have also read Catching Fire, and will read Mockingjay as well. What a great series. Very well written.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I'm going through and I'm seeing a lot of reviews, after having just watched this movie, that are not fully justified.  Certainly, there could have been improvements made to the movie such as...<br /><br />1.  Not focus on the relationship so much but rather on the alien invasion and what happened to Earth since man abandoned it.<br /><br />2.  Jaden Smith not acting like he's four years old but instead like a 14 year old.  The \\"being scared\\" routine got pretty stale by the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad movie but not a great movie.  I'm only giving it five stars simply to help balance out the negative reviews this movie received instead of the four that I wanted to give it.

B007MC0IAG|5.0|I recommend this product to ever mother who has children in school. I like the way the author writes about the reality (the light, the stars, the earthquakes) because it helps the children to understand what is beautiful in studying science.
1936719010|5.0|I enjoyed War of Art, but I find I get more from Do The Work.<br /><br />This book recaps the nuggets from War of Art, and then gets specific with examples that Pressfield personally uses.<br /><br />I have already applied his formula he uses for novel writing to another area of my life with success.<br />As Pressfield states, the ideas apply to any pursuit, not just writing.<br /><br />Do the Work is shorter, so I get the wisdom of WOA plus reminders on application, quickly.<br /><br />When I'm needing more encouragement I go<br />back to WOA.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|when I got the multi tool I did not know every use for it but over time I found that this tool is use full as can be and it is also handy to use in the shop.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After a riveting start, the momentum slowed in order for the reader to become accustomed to the setting of this story. If you find yourself a bit disenchanted with the pace, PUSH THROUGH! It IS worth it! The story only gets better from thereon in and the twists and turns will leave you thinking about this depicted world long after you put your kindle down.<br />Often during the reading of this novel, I had to look around and remind myself that this is not the world that I live in, and to stop feeling too depressed.<br />The climax was elegantly disguised, with a large number of occurances that one could easily assume to be the ending.<br />I recommend this book to all, and will now search for a new author whenever i am in need of a book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really like this Mahjong so far. At first, I didn't think it was challenging enough, but now I know that it builds each level and gets harder and harder. So far I'm having fun with it. This is the 3rd Mahjong game I have purchased.

B00CATONCA|2.0|When season 2 came out i got the limited edition with the zombie head and it was fantastic, so i decided to add to the collection and get the season 3 limited edition. When it came in the mail i was very excited, but after opening, i was not amused. it feels cheap and just doesn't have the awe factor that i got from the season 2 limited edition. hopefully they step up their game with season 4s limited edition when it comes out

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Christians, particularly those who like Paul in the New Testament, may not like this book.  Reza Aslan attempts to accurately describe the historical Jesus and the ancient world.  The resulting picture is different than the one painted in most of the New Testament.<br /><br />Reza tries to provide a historical understanding of Jesus of Nazareth by describing the context of the life and times of Israel and Jerusalem around the time that Jesus the Son of Man lived.  He describes the geography and political details of the region and period to provide the context of the man and the message.<br /><br />Reza brings in various historical records beyond the New Testament as well as the work of other historians.  He ignores some New Testament passages as not historically accurate while explaining why they were written and the context the author had in mind.  He does not denounce those passages as \\"wrong\\", but simply not written as historically accurate records. (He also provides detailed notes about the academic debate on the subject of said accuracy and interpretation.)<br /><br />The picture he paints of Jesus is one of zeal for his Jewish faith and the cry of poor.  He paints a man from the lower class of society standing up to the rich and powerful who are abusing or ignoring the less fortunate, knowing that his attack on those in power is a capital offense.<br /><br />Surprising to me is that Reza's historical analysis supports the miracles attributed to Jesus including his resurrection.  He does not provide historical evidence of the resurrection but places great stock in the followers of Jesus who gave witness and remained committed to a messiah who was crucified, rose, and who would return.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book he describes in some detail the conflict between teachings taught by his disciples who knew him personally, such as James and Peter, and the idea of Jesus taught by Paul.  Reza describes Paul as an upper class Greek speaking Roman citizen who is extremely devoted to his own personal idea of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Finally he points to the cultural and historical impact of the destruction of Jerusalem as the turning point in the story of the Jesus who lived into the Jesus most commonly known today.<br /><br />I thought the book provides a richer and fuller understanding of the Jesus I follow.  Ultimately, one's faith should be strengthened by facts and historical accuracy.  If you are such a person I encourage you to read this book.  I don't blindly accept everything said, but I'm glad I read it.  If you are the type of person who would pick apart the ideas and arguments in this book to defend your faith to your last breath, then you need not read it - you will not get anything out of it.is extremely devoted to his own personal idea of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Finally he points to the cultural and historical impact of the destruction of Jerusalem as the turning point in the story of the Jesus who lived into the Jesus most commonly known today.<br /><br />I thought the book provides a richer and fuller understanding of the Jesus I follow.

B00AYB0TOW|1.0|It differed to greatly from the first movie. Was boring and too slowly moved through the story line. Not enough action, too much lovey doviy parts.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love books about the old south so I may be biased but really couldn't put it down.  The characters were rich and believable.  Really opened my eyes as to how the slaves lived and how they became dependent on their plantation and owners.  I was truly taken away and felt like I was there.
B00068C7WA|3.0|Was a gift for my mom. She really liked it. The only thing that was a problem was that the CD case arrived all cracked up so had to put it into an old CD case before I gave it to her. That's why i'm giving it 3 stars.

B00D6DVSAE|1.0|There was a time when I bought every thing Sting released that I could get my hands on.  Albums, singles, videos,DVD's.  But that was a long time ago.  In fact it's been 14 years since Sting released what I consider to be his last decent album of original material with \\"Brand New Day\\" in 1999.  Hmmm... that was in the previous millenium!!!  Since then I have been continuously frustrated by his self indulgent releases and re-hashing of the classics.  The only decent thing he has done since BND is when he toured again with The Police, and that is now several years ago too.<br />I had actually given up on Sting, believing that his ego had outgrown his fame (and that's saying something).  That was because I could come up with no other logical reason for his lack of new original material that would somewhat please the legions of fans that have followed his career with pleasure.  I couldn't believe that an artist of his talent could no longer write songs that struck a chord with his fan base, so ego it had to be.<br />Then as somewhat of a surprise I read that a new album of original material was indeed on the horizon, and I got a bit excited, hoping from what I read that it might be a return to form, somewhat in keeping with \\"The Soul Cages\\" given the subject matter.  Talk about being smacked in the face with a dead fish!  This album is nothing like TSC, or any other Sting album for that matter, and has very little going for it to please fans of his glory days like me.<br />There are 2 songs on this album that are half decent.  Just 2!!! (August Winds & Language Of Birds), and remember I said that even these are only have decent, and by that I mean in terms of Sting standards.  They fail dismerably in comparison to songs from Dream Of The Blue Turtles, Nothing Like The Sun, the Soul Cages, Ten Summoner's Tales, Mercury Falling or Brand New Day, and that's without comparing to The Police classics.<br />He may well be attempting to tell a story, but he's done that before without sounding this bad.  Musically these songs are pretty boring, and the vocals are... well... URGH!!!  If you think that Sting singing in an accent sounds appealing then this may be for you, but it's not what I want to hear from Sting and I'm sure many people will agree.  There are some guest vocalists but they do nothing to salvage the shipwreck.  So why make an album like this?  The answer has to be pretentiousness and pure self indulgence, because he has yet again shown that he is prepared to continue down this path of ignoring his fan base and what they want to hear from him.<br />If I could rate this album zero I would.  One star is too good for it.  He has sunk to a new low with \\"The Last Ship\\", and maybe the captain has gone down with it.  But in any case, I have now definitely given up on Sting.ithout sounding this bad.  Musically these songs are pretty boring, and the vocals are... well... URGH!!!

B004UNX1LS|5.0|When Vevo first appeared as an app on my Roku, I started compiling histories, for playlists, of my favorite videos.  Then I discovered a Lebanese video by Myriam Fares, then another.  I emailed Vevo to tell them Hey, I'd pay a little for something like this, especially as you get more international music, and I don't mean only Spanish.  The site was redesigned.  Two Lebanese videos by Nancy Ajram appeared.  Then a few more genres.  Yes, yes, yes.  Really, though, I'd rather pay two dollars a month and ditch the commercials.  And now I can watch on my Kindle.  If you love music videos and want to watch them over and over, get this app.

1476727651|5.0|DOCTOR SLEEP is way more than a simple sequel. It is an elaborated and entire novel. It doesn't require to have read THE SHINING to be appreciated, nor seen any of the movies. It is a relentless novel, one that doesn't undo its grip (and that we do not want, either, to let go of).<br /><br />It is an excellent novel, one that I can only highly recommend, and one that will easily join other masterpieces such as CARRIE, THE STAND, or IT... for mentioning only a few of the most popular horror novels by Stephen King.<br />But contrary to those books, Doctor Sleep seems quieter, and shows signs of maturity regarding life.<br /><br />DOCTOR SLEEP will not be remembered for being a sequel for THE SHINING, but for being an exceptional horror novel.
B000GOZ0ZK|4.0|This movie is a blast! Sure, it's obvious and cliche but, if you're watching this kind of movie looking for cerebral stimulation, you probably need to up your meds. Dive into the unreal and just laugh a while. Whatever you do, if you ever get to eat over at LL's house, make sure he didn't let his bird help with the frosting.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I really hemmed & hawed whether or not to buy into this manufactured tie-in to my fav show. I bit the bullet & downloaded,expecting to be disappointed .Much to my delight,I really enjoyed it.I'm usually a cosy- mystery, Grafton, Muller & Cornwell aficionado .This book has a little of each.Not too heavy, not too light. No matter who is really writing them,I look forward to reading them all.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This novel is a strange sci-fi that teaches the reader of the importance of the normal things we take for granted, such as loving families, joy, color, and even sunlight.  A powerful book I enjoyed!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Michael does a great job at debunking existing myths and giving a solid framework for serious gains. The book is an easy read and he gives plenty of cited evidence for his claims. There isn't a magical secret that he reveals, but rather a provides a good argument on the way one can workout and diet to achieve their fitness goals. I had hit a plateau where I would only see small gains week to week. After a 2 months of following the weight lifting method he outlines, I've seen significant gains in strength (lifting much heavier) and body size.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|All the readers in my family read The Shining over the course of about a month. The book passed along the line.  I'll never forget my Mom reading it alone, at night at the kitchen table. The overhead light and her own reflection in our big window to the back yard.<br /><br />This was before the open layouts that were so popular. Our kitchen could be closed off from the table all the way over to the dining room at the opposite end. My brother and I who had both read the book, peaking around the door watching Mom. Engrossed.  Edge of the chair leaning into the book. She was asking for it.<br /><br />\\"BAaaaargh!\\" we screamed. Mom jumped like she'd been goosed with a car battery, screaming too and throwing the book in reflex. Totally worth it.<br /><br />In any event, the sequel has some meaning for me.  Can't say it scared me as much as the Shining did when I was twelve. I'm older or Mr. King is older --- one of those impacted the sequel. Still, Dan Torrance has that same heart and soul that made the first book so good. And the hope is there too. You'll like it.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Great beginner escape game. Nothing too difficult but really fun! Enjoyed this one a lot but it's way too short. Double the length and it would get 5 stars.

0385743564|4.0|David doesn't think of himself as smart, but he's an expert on weapons and Epics. Epics are the super-powered men and women who are now malevolent rulers, constantly fighting each other for more power. No Epics have ever stepped up to be heroes. Only the Reckoners fight back, regular humans who take out the Epics in secret. David's brilliant deductions leads him to the Reckoners in hopes of finally having a chance to take out Steelheart and avenging his father's murder.<br /><br />Sanderson proves once again that he is a master at creating fascinating characters and weaving complex plots. Fast-paced and action-packed, Steelheart is a solid first installment in a new, science fiction YA trilogy. Fans of X-Men will enjoy this super-powered twist with plenty of adventure, suspense, and mystery.<br /><br />Review previously posted at SciFiChick.
B008D30K7E|2.0|Unfortunately unlike everyone else I found this book boring. Actually gave up and did'nt finish it. Too easy predictable to write about events that have already happened.

B0063GORYU|5.0|THIS is a fun ap to play on my Kindle fire HD. It's challenging but still I am able to win the games. The graphics are good and there are nice features like a quick tap on the top card of the row you wish to move and it automatically moves to the open space. Time flies when you're having fun and I've found this game to be a great way to ride the stationary bike for longer periods of time.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Anything that could happen on a slave plantation happens in this predictable story. We read it in my Book Club and all agreed that the main character was not well developed so that she was believable. The uuse of the two narrators fell a bit short and often was just a re-telling of an event. One member of our Club said it was like reading &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34; all over again only with a female. I was disappointed in how wishy washy the main character was and wanted her to &#34;get a spine&#34; and do something positive!

Jesus, this is so awful and boring... gave this one away after I noticed that I skipped the songs always halfway through while having my iPod on shuffle-mode. the songs do unfortunately stick out, in a bad way when compared to other contemporary releases. not good, not good at all. NEXT!

B00ARF92HK|4.0|The only complaint really is the quality of the video as Amazon still does not allow HD quality to be played on a PC. Other than that, it's a fairly good adaption of the comic books.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|writing is childish and pedantic. It creates a cool world, but you don't care much about the characters. Harry potter, or even Charlie Bone, is better. Yuch. even for free, don't bother,, it is at least an hour of your life you will never get back.

B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a wonderful game.  You go through many levels to get to higher places.  Just a lot of fun.  Make sure you get a star.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|There are several very good songs here and even a couple of great ones (in fact Seize The Night is one of his best of all time!), however unfortunately there are several losers here too, especially In the Land of the Pig (horrible) and Cry Over Me.  Get rid of a few songs and this would have been a 5-star effort.  Recommended.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I had seen the movie then decided to read this and the others in the trilogy before watching the movie again. Far more exciting!
B005LAII4E|3.0|This was a bit predictable, but the graphics and action was good and it was much better than watching the Wayne brother screw things up! Probably better as a Redbox rental....
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Consider this a review from someone who hasn't read a single word of the books by Kami Garcia & Margaret Stohl, but whose interest has been sufficiently piqued by this film adaptation, particularly in regards to what happens next.<br /><br />The story had been described to me as \\"Twilight, only good\\" and on sitting down to watch it soon became apparent that this was an inverted [[ASIN:0316243981 Twilight]]. Though it's a mortal/supernatural romance and therefore a forbidden love story, in this case it's the girl who is one of the \\"beautiful creatures\\" of the title, whilst the boy is the fascinated outsider who just can't stop himself from trying to untangle this inexplicable human-shaped mystery.<br /><br />The gist of the story: Ethan Wate lives in Gatlin, South Carolina, a backwater town with \\"twelve churches and one library.\\" He can't wait to finish high school so he can leave for good, but his momentum slows a little when the new girl comes to town. Lena Duchannes is an instant target of gossip by his classmates, with rumours that her family are Satan-worshippers and that she's the reason for the bizarre weather patterns in the area. Naturally, all this simply piques his interest - particularly since he recognises Lena from a series of recurring dreams that he's been experiencing. He investigates further, offers her his hand in friendship, and in due course learns that she's a witch (or in preferable terms: a Caster).<br /><br />It is in this that the film is at its strongest: when it's concentrating on the budding attraction and mutual fascination between Ethan and Lena, helped along with some fairly snappy dialogue. Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert have great chemistry, enough to cover for the relative speed of the falling-in-love process, and they make Ethan and Lena's affection for each other easy to believe in. Neither one is remotely glamorous or conventionally good-looking, and the film isn't afraid to make them look uncool: he wears dorky reading glasses and she never goes without her dark eye-shadow.<br /><br />Together they capture that sweet, clumsy, sincere first love that exists between teenagers. Ethan's persistent pursuit of an initially prickly Lena could have turned sour if not portrayed carefully, but it's soon clear that it's his ability to take the weird and wonderful elements of her life in his stride that wins her over.<br /><br />The two of them are booklovers (Ethan reads Kurt Vonnegut, Lena recommends Charles Bukowski) and they're endearingly pretentious about it (as opposed to \\"Twilight\\", in which Edward and Bella's frequent comparisons of themselves to Romeo and Juliet was just plain pretentious). He's fascinated by something new and challenging, and she opens up to his simple kindness and - in her words - \\"drooling charm.\\"<br /><br />In fact, it almost comes as a disappointment to learn that they have a connection based on a love affair in a past life. I believed in them as teenagers, not as epic lovers, and the \\"flashbacks to a past life\\" element felt completely unnecessary, almost serving to undermine the sweetness of the bond they formed in the here-and-now.<br /><br />Of course, this is when the plot comes a-knocking, and where the film begins to lose its steam. It transpires that in Lena's family, all the Casters go through a ceremony on their sixteenth birthday that determines whether or not they'll be claimed by the forces of the light or the dark. According to them, this is when each individual's true nature reveals itself, and in Lena's case (given her parentage and latent powers) this is a huge deal. She is rightfully terrified by her impending birthday, and though I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt and assume that there's more exploration into the ethical implications of this plot-point, it's not handled particularly well in the film itself.<br /><br />It's certainly not perfect. The plot is meandering, and never quite decides whether it wants to be a simple love story or acoming-of-age drama with a side order of witches and magic spells. Several characters flit in and then immediately out of the storyline without any indication of where they are/what they're doing while they're off-screen, and there is a central conceit regarding free will and destiny which really did not sit well with me. But for the most part, it's a fun ride.<br /><br />I suppose we'll never know how they managed to get Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson (as siblings Macon and Seraphin) on board for this, but the two of them are clearly having a blast, and if it weren't for their limited screen-time, they would have certainly stolen the film right out from under our teen protagonists. Viola Davis as Amma is sadly wasted and Emmy Rossum packs a (small) punch as Ridley in which she very much plays against type.<br /><br />Finally, the whole thing reminded me a bit of [[ASIN:B000HF6XVS Practical Magic]] in tone, but with a distinct Southern atmosphere: lots of fun costumes and intricate set designs: wild exteriors contrasted with pristine interiors, and a real Gothic flavour. And wisteria - lots and lots of wisteria.coming-of-age drama with a side order of witches and magic spells.

B004H83IM8|5.0|Its just a collection of DVDs so not much to say about this product as a product itself except that I didnt really like how Movie 1 and Movie 3 are on the same disc and Movie 2 is on a separate disc, but it doesnt really matter anyway.

B0070DR5Y4|5.0|Really liked the story line and it was so funny I watched it three days in a row. Makes me smile just thinking about it.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Great movie for those who love a suspenseful drama.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon give stellar performances as three childhood friends (one of whom goes through a traumatic event) who have grown apart, but become reacquainted again as adults under unfortunate  circumstances. I don't want to give the movie away--I will just say that I don't think you'll be disappointed. The cast also includes: Marcia Gay Harden, Emmy Rossum, Laura Linney, and Laurence Fishburne.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Well I bought this for my Dad for Christmas because he has always wanted it. It came super quick and a decent price.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|The story is a little depressing, but the action scenes are amazing, and the girls are awesome. Recommend for those who like movies like Captain America.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The album overall is great, a true comeback since Train Of Thought for me. The last 3 albums weren't that good for me, yeah they had some moments but, the adjective here is...some.<br /><br />The album is heavy, fast and progressive. None are over 10 minutes long except the last song, something I disliked from their previous 3 albums was that they had a couple songs clocking around 10 to 14 minutes long and it took forever, they weren't good and got boring after the 8th minute.<br /><br />This album though, has many songs hovering between 5 and 9 minutes, which is much shorter and adds to some intensity and melody to other songs except to just 1. This album has some elements of some Prog bands like: Rush, Porcupine Tree, Pain Of Salvation.<br /><br />I was amazed at the album and look for more of this in the future but I have to say, another 10 to 20 years of Dream Theater is enough.
B004XQO90O|3.0|don't know if it is one I will re-watch or not but it was worth it for the a single view.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Have always enjoyed star trek! This is the best idea for a prequel series ever(alternate reality). The characters are played by some great actors to make both movies have a real star trek feel! Time went by so quickly during the movie that it proves the movie was great!

B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This is a very, very scary flick! Awesome acting! I'm not a big fan of Hawke, but he was terrific and the lady who played his wife is an amazing actress.  I also loved Detective so&so, he should have gotten some kind of award for this film! That being said, I was somewhat annoyed throughout that hawke would put his family at risk the way he did, kind of silly. No one would really do that! But it was creepy and scary and jumpy and suspenseful and hardly any gore, which is what I like! It had the feel of The Strangers, which also freaked me out!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I always have trouble sleeping and when I do its for 2-3hours tops.....it knocked me out and I had the longest sleep in a very long time it's great and the timer is a plus
B007DIQC90|5.0|My daughter, who I have miraculously remained friends with well into her teen years, and I recently went to a movie. Can't remember the name but the two minutes that the preview to The Secret Live of Walter Mitty appeared was worth the price of admission. I was just nailed to the seat by this song. Of course, being the old fuddy duddy that I am, I had no idea what group was singing it. Deferring to my musically brilliant daughter, I learned that it was Dirty Paws by Of Monsters and Men. I wanted to leave right then and buy this beautiful, majestic, awe inspiring song.  What a rare treasure this whole album is. Still, every time I hear Dirty Paws I ball like a little boy. Is it too hyperbolic to gush so torrentially(not a word but I don't care)? Probably, but I don't care.
B008476HBM|5.0|Being a somewhat of a romantic, it's not surprising that I enjoyed this book immensely. But at myself also being a masculine man, that I enjoyed it more than a manly action flick/book, should come as a surprise. Though it didn't to I who loved the movies so...

B001NEK2GE|4.0|Most games require the use of labeling your keyboard with little stickers, tape, or memorize them in order to use the product effectively. The drawback is when you want to use the keyboard for other uses and many of the keys are covered up. This keypad allows you to program 22 keys, a directional thumb switch for four directional control (like a small mouse) as well as two mouse like click keys. You have up to 3  banks of these keys that you can program and assign to different games or other applications. You can also record simple macros for multiple function control with one key press. The gamepad does not limit you to three key assignments, just three active assignments at a time. What it does allow is for you to create and save as many key assignments as you wish and save them for when you need them.<br /><br />Here are the reasons for 4 stars. (1) The top click switch almost requires you to remove your hand from the main keypad. (2) When the application is loaded and you add a function to a key, you often have to reboot the pc. This may be a Win 7 quirk, but it is a minor issue considering you will likely program all the keys to start with. (4) The LCD display is a nice addition with several functions. The one I like is the count up  & count down timers (on the same screen.) The count up timer lets me know how ling I have been at the pc, but, the count down timer is set for a fixed 5 minute count down and there is no audible alert when the 5 minutes runs down. There are keys below the display to adjust it, but they only set it to 5 minutes. (5) The picture shown on Amazon makes the gamepad look like it is elevated in the front. In reality, it is sloped slightly downward, in the front.<br /><br /> Having played with the device with some key intensive games, the downside issues are not that big of a problem.<br /><br /> One item that may not be worth mentioning, the device is a USB component. If all of your USB ports are used, I would purchase an inexpensive powered multiport USB outlet to add a few more USB's to your pc as well as providing power to them from a small external power supply. These devices plug into a standard USB itself, so you do not need to monkey around inside your computer.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great app especially for free. I feel a little guilty. I always wanted to learn spanish but those programs are so expensive. I would be happy even if I paid for this.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a refreshing change from books I read. This is the story of Henrietta Lacks but more importantly, it is the history of cell research. Awesome! Thanks you REbecca Skloot
B0063GORYU|5.0|I played this game slot on my computer and its so much fun you have to be careful because you really get into beating your last score that you loose track of time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A great read.....a powerful storyline for that time in our American history....really opened my eyes to that period of time for these disadvantaged children.

B000N588T2|5.0|Few people will ever be able to capture an audience's imagination in 15 or 20 minute stories.  Kurosawa could approach moral character from a side angle that doesn't often seem preachy (although the one about nuclear technology comes close.)  He fixes your eyes on things that matter for the future, caring about others, and being honorable.  It's worth watching just for the Dr. Seuss-like perceptions of Van Gogh.
B000008L5W|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and Stay with me is my favorite.  The CD came in quickly and the product is excellent. I give it a<br />five star review.  I will order more.
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|One wants to be kind where Sting is concerned--his history is too rich to impoverish with loose criticism.  This new cd gives us plenty of reasons to be kind--but not overly so.  The treat here is the voluminous wealth of storytelling in, what has to be, the most prodigious outpouring of language by any pop composer in 50 years.  You will find nothing in the iconography of popular music to compare with \\"The Last Ship.\\"  It deserves your respect and even your curiosity for its dedication to the deeper and broader tale, musically conveyed.  However, the trick is in the derivative nature of the music.  Only rarely, does it throttle the senses with an interesting passing chord or a complex harmony. Melodically, it is much too reliant on complicated form which is unhinged by only passable tune-smithing. For the most part, there is just inadequate melodic fuel here. When melodies do surge forcefully, as in the title track, or in the chorus of \\"And Yet,\\" they transport, just as we hope that they will.<br /><br />The production is absolutely top-notch and Sting's voice and vernacular interpretations are as fine as one would expect.<br /><br />This is truly an \\"album\\" and well worth owning and, to be candid, it would get 3 1/2 stars if it could be fractionally scored.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This reminds me of a Playlist Alarm clock as I am able to go to Settings and select Sound Type and select one of these: Ringtone, Music, Random Songs by artist, Random songs by Playlist. So I selected Random songs by Playlist. It is so wonderful to have this come on in the morning to awaken me and it begins the songs a lower level and then gradually allows the full sound level. How nice to be gently awakened. This has so many ways you can wake up from a ringtone to special music or playlist.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love love this series and I really loved the last book. It added depth to the two previous books! This was one of the best endings I've read in a long time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have had this book for about two days and I have finished it. It is so good!!!!!!!! I can't read a page without reading 10 chapters. I would tell myself ok just one more page and all of a sudden I have finished the book. I really like how brave and fierce Katniss is yet sometimes she cries. The only problem problem I have with this book is that it feels like I finished it too fast. I highly recommend this book. It's worth the money. I think I see book two in my future!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is simply fantastic. Gillian Flynn keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire novel. I loved the suspense of not knowing what would happen next throughout the whole book!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I love how the author writes and his character is very human. I have read all his Kurt Wallander books and wish there were more.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|This WiFi Analyzer is the best that I have found as that is has many ways I can view WiFi signals at home (in surrounding areas) and places that I go to as hotels, coffee shops, cafes, etc.<br /><br />You can view ALL the known WiFi signal areas close to you in 5 types: 1) Channel Graph - Compares all of the known WiFi signals in the area and shows you in graph form--strength number. 2) Time Graph - Compares how STABLE a WiFi is over a period of time. If it goes up in better signal or down. 3) Channel Rating - Gives it's review stars on best channels for WiFi router. 4) AP List (MY FAVORITE ONE) - This gives a bar graph to each WiFi area and the channel and also the IP Address, Gateway, Server IP and more. It even gives the name of the Router! 5) Signal Meter - BEST ONE I use this often! This is from -100 (No WiFi) to -40 Strongest WiFi. Note that when you are in the GREEN area from -60 to -40 you are at a VERY STRONG (5 bar) WiFi signal.<br /><br />Before I purchased this exceptional tool, I was having trouble with my WiFi signal in one end of my house. As it turned out by looking at the AP List type of graph picture (which shows all local WiFi strength and channels) my next door neighbor and I both has the same brand of router and each of our routers was set to channel one. So, I reset my router to 6 (which is stronger channel) and no more problems with WiFi even at the far end of my home.<br /><br />Another great thing about this WiFi app is the fact that I can test different devices to see which one has the strongest WiFi signal and keeps the strong signal. This is important to me as I want to travel with the device that has the strongest WiFi radio for best reception.<br />Also, I use this tool to see how well my own router is signaling the WiFi and on the go, use it to check other WiFi signals so I can choose the strongest one for my device.<br /><br />So I hope that you will try this one out, I believe that you will love this app!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love Sherlock!  It's fast moving and clever done the last part.  The new modern twist on the original classic stories is brilliant.  I'm hooked!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book overall, was actually really good.<br /><br />The plot twist was cliche and it definitely was predictable (I called it a few chapters in) but Gillian used it in a way that was refreshing.<br /><br />THE DREADED ENDING EVERYONE IS HATING ON.<br /><br />I agree, the ending was a bit unsatisfactory in a sense. But if you think about it, it's actually pretty neat. I can understand why Gillian wrote it the way she did. Think about the characters and their personalities and evaluate the ending using their state of mind.<br /><br />I won't let the ending affect my feelings on the novel. It was a well written page turner with amazing central characters and an interesting perspective on marriage. Those things alone deserve four stars. A star off because I can't help but wonder whether she could have written a better ending.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a great read for anyone who has struggled with the loss of a loved one due to a battle with cancer. This book has the perfect mixture of humor & tragedy. I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone ages 15 and up! :)
B008CB9JJ2|5.0|My first Auster book. I will now read all the others. He touched my soul. He touched my heart. Great
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|When I first got it I was disappointed because it was more pop-py and young sounding than I expected. I had to realize that she just turned 21 so the material is going to be relative to what she has experienced so far in her life. With that being said, after listening to it a few times over, I have grown to like this album. I love screaming at the top of my lungs in my car with Demi lol.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I so recommend this book is so awesome read it u will love it I 100 percent promise. Way better then the Movie
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best books I have read in a long time! If you have ever felt judged because you were &#34;different&#34; or judged someone else, read this book. It will touch your heart, make you smile, bring a tear to your eye, and possibly change you in some small way.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Varied from the book a bit... but so does practically every book from the movie but still enjoyable!<br />watch it
0307279189|5.0|Fascinating book. Not often that nonfiction reads like a blur and you can't put it down. Offers genuinely great perspective and advice to runners, though I believe it would be interesting to non-runners also.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|First the story has been told a thousand times, but better. This is a watered down version of previous movies that has a creepy house with a creepy person living in it with a tragic past. Very predictable and there are several holes in the story that drove me crazy! Anyway Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress and she acts well in this movie-even though her character does every predictable stupid thing a heroin in a horror movie can do. I would not waste my time on it! If you are a fan of Jennifer's go watch any other movie she is in but this one.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I absolutely love this show and don't think I could ever tire of watching it. It was such a great show.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This came with my Kindle Fire HD.  It works really well...so much so that I use it to charge my phone and my boyfriend's tablet.  I'm buying this because I'm tired of changing off all of our devices on the  one charger  that works well.<br /><br /> This is geared towards the Kindle,  but it works with Samsung Galaxy S3  phones and  Google Nexxus  tablets,  too.  For us,  it works better than the chargers that came with the other devices.
0763660531|5.0|Enchanting and Imaginative!!!  I shared this book with my kids and some of their friends all ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old and they were in awe.  It appeals to all ages.  As I turned each page they guessed what the little girl would draw next and where she would go.  It is captivating despite being wordless.  It has strong visual messages; it conveys the importance of friendship, the value of having an active imagination, the power of belief, it sparks creativity that can take us anywhere at any time.  It is a visual reminder that there are no limits to what we can imagine.  It is filled with stunning artwork--a vivid red crayon against a sepia background, and as the story unfolds more color begins seeping in giving it a glowing ethereal feel to it.  Inspiring wordless masterpiece!
B009AY04A8|3.0|Is a good game but has to much talking in between games...would rather it have more mini games...or have a shorter story...

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read.  Loved it.  Recommended this book to everyone I know.  Great book to take on vacation and read around the pool
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very good messages. Sone sporadic unnecessary profanity. Would have been better without it.  Heartwarming. Tears and laughs. Unique perspective narrated by family dog.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great read and breather from some of my previous books.  It was real life, different, and kept you guessing.  I would highly recommend this book.  If you don't follow multiple narrators, this will probably be a tough book for you, but I love that variety of different narrators within one story.  And a GREAT bonus is that it's a single novel, no series! :)
B00514HDNW|5.0|I had wanted to read \\"I Am Legend\\" since seeing the movie. However, this is one of those rare occasions where I preferred the movie, but obviously enjoyed the book, too, hence 5-stars. The book was different and vastly different from the film. Like \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" the book and film only share character names and a loose concept.<br /><br />A bizarre vampire virus has swept across the globe, infecting every human and animal on the planet. Robert Neville has lost everyone he has ever known and loved and must fight for survival amongst the undead, his former friends and neighbors. He appears to be the lone survivor of this plague that mutates victims into creatures of the night, until he catches a glimpse of a redhead woman in a tattered white dress shuffling down the street in broad daylight.<br /><br />The brilliance of this story is the exploration of the human psyche. How would a man endure being the lone survivor of a plague? How he would handle being hunted by monsters who were once friends and loved ones? Would he succumb to loneliness, hopelessness, and fear, or would he prevail? Matheson breathes life into Neville. The reader feels him and feels for him. I found myself creating alternative storylines in my head because I couldn't stand his predicament. I could completely relate to Neville, except in one instance: his lusting over the female zombie/vampires. That did get an eye roll. Every other emotion and struggle seemed plausible in an implausible situation.
B00004WNE4|5.0|this album is great, you should buy it and listen to it with your family or friends<br /><br />if you listen to it with your friends, you should all get baked (goods) together and enjoy the album.<br />if you listen to it with your family, you should get baked (goods) by yourself and enjoy the album.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Without question a movie that defined what a racing movie should be, while giving an idea of what it was like back then in the actual race.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Having watched the heart-rending movie of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I decided it was time to read the novel. The character and plot development are outstanding. One might think the poverty depicted is from another time. Sadly, the same story could be told by many children growing up today.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love the movie but I may be a little biased because I'm a bit of a Trekkie! Haha But seriously, a great film! Can't wait for a feature film with more Borg action!!!
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Oh YEAH!!! New Carcass = Greatness. Into the second track I could swear I smelled something akin to a rotting corpse coming from my headphones. It's not Necroticism - Descanting the Insalubrious. It doesn't matter. The songs are amazing, and the cover has everything you need to dissect and catalogue, including a toe tag.<br />Full on energetic thrash that descends into pure Carcass with such epic titles as \\"A Congealed Clot of Blood\\".<br /><br />And if you haven't seen them live - go do it. So much fun, you'll decapitate your friends. People will most certainly get trampled during The Master Butcher's Apron, Noncompliance, and every other song for that matter.<br /><br />CARCASS!!!

1250012570|3.0|This is a very sweet book about two teenage misfits who fall in love.  Park is half Korean - a rarity in 1980s Omaha - who loves comic books and punk music but doesn't fit in with the popular crowd.  Eleanor is new to the school, a large, freckled redhead with an eclectic dress sense and an unhappy home life.  They sit together on the bus to school everyday, and gradually get to know one another.  Eventually they will fall in love.<br /><br />Early in the book, their English class is discussing the enduring appeal of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and Park comments that \\"people want to remember what it's like to be young and in love\\".  Essentially, that's what this book is about.  The intensity of first love, despite the barriers that their families and schoolmates put up.<br /><br />I liked this book, but for me it didn't have the magic to transcend its YA genre.  Ultimately it unfolded too slowly and too predictably (although not entirely predictably).  It's a sweet, heartwarming story and both Eleanor and Park are likeable characters, but it never evolved into more than that for me.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|There is very little wrong with this movie. Though for people who aren't into racing, the 3hr run time might be a bit much. I can only hope &#34;Rush&#34; might be able to be as memorable of a movie.
B00CL151G4|1.0|Elementary is to Deductive reasoning what Twilight is to vampire movies. This show is like a teenagers version of the UK Sherlock show, where little thinking is required.<br /><br />Jonny Miller seems to be the wrong actor for the role of Sherlock. He doesn't pull it off, and in some scenes looks like someone with Down syndrome rather than a genius. In the UK show Sherlock, the Sherlock character would come off as arrogant but he earned that through his genius deductions. In this show, not so much.<br /><br />Overall, i was very unimpressed both with the main actor (although Lucy Liu did a great job) and the writing. If you have seen the UK show Sherlock, then i would recommend going and watching something else.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The simple stylistic writing lets the story manifest into a newly formed epic. The reader is captured by the perpetual motion of heart pounding action and suspense. The first book in a series hinting at what greatness may come. An excellent start to what will be an epic series. Get a copy today and hope that day will come soon where hero's need no longer be tragedies.

B00942Y4IY|4.0|I don't know why I love this movie so much.  I've seen it dozens of times, and suddenly it popped up on Amazon Instant in HD, so I had to do it... AGAIN!  Maybe it is because it is so cheesy, I dunno.  Casting is brilliant, certainly appropriate.  And, of course, this is the original that spawned an unimaginably lengthy franchise, with all the spin-offs, etc.  None of which can really hold a candle to James Spader and Kurt Russell!  IMHO, of course.

B006FTCH2E|5.0|No need to reiterate all the kudos for the film.  I loved it:  Great acting, writing, concept.<br /><br />My complaint goes beyond \\"Another Earth\\" to include many similarly fine films that make unforgivable mistakes and / or intentional embellishments.<br /><br />The scene to which I refer is where Rhoda describes cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's experiences during the first manned space shot.  Rhoda says Yuri was in space for \\"28 days.\\"  Rhoda goes on to describe a totally fictional account of Gagarin's experiences.<br /><br />Wikipedia states:  \\"The spaceflight consisted of a single orbit of the Earth (to this date the shortest orbital manned spaceflight). According to official records, the spaceflight took 108 minutes from launch to landing.\\"<br />Gagarin completed one orbit of the Earth.<br /><br />What I never understand is this:  Why take an exceptional film and tarnish it with wrong information on easily checked facts?  The scene with Rhoda describing the repetitive sound in the space capsule and the musical correlation was in no way central the the movie.  Surely something else equally provocative and interesting could have been done without such a dramatic distortion of facts that every schoolboy knows.<br /><br />There you go:  Great movie with one really, really stupid mistake.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|I stayed in bed all day (cancelling all my appointments) to read this book in one sitting. I read this in April of 2012, and 'The Fear Index' was one of the most polished, in terms of prose, and interesting, books that I had ever read. It made the world of finance, and the people involved in that world, quite mesmerizing.<br /><br />The characters felt like complex, entirely believable, living, breathing people. The author has the great knack of, in the words of Georges Simenon, creating or capturing an ambiance in his writing. Reading this book was like being in the setting, observing the characters in their intense lives and world. It would make a brilliant movie.<br /><br />I don't know why this book has such a meh 3-star rating on Amazon. It's a really interesting psychological thriller. Think #foreign #hightech #fascinating. Happy reading~*

The app is crammed full of pop-up ads which, after some time, can become maddening. It drains my device's battery, and is a waste of time. Although it does provide a radar image and a seven-day forecast, I suggest spending the extra ninety-nine cents that it costs for a better app.

B008G3N71W|4.0|This book starts of with a bang. Literally, but it continues at a quick pace as Greta is pulled through the experiences Richard holds for her. I've never considered myself particularly shy when it came to sexual topics, but there were a few times that I was really glad I was reading the book at home as my face flushed from the scenes. While incredibly erotic, the story is well built and even more so is the feelings that Greta goes through. I think a lot of women will be able to relate to Greta in one way or another despite not wanting to admit to such a thing. The idea of a drop gorgeous man teaching a woman how to self confident while being pleased sexually is one of those deep dark fantasies that a lot of women hold inside. I was really surprised as the character started morphing into a pony and felt that the last paragraph of the book was a bit weak, but over all, it was a great book to give self confidence to women about their sexualities while learning a new position or two!
B00BHMEALA|1.0|I'm sorry. I watched this movie TWICE! because I thought I had missed something. Whether it was factual or as close to the truth as it could get was not an issue for me.

Lucy Lui is fabulous and understated, yet she is always surprising us with her capabilities to keep up with Holmes., and their chemistry together is unmistakable.

B000001GQU|5.0|Recorded in mono sound in 1954, this Verdi Requiem conducted by Hungarian conductor Ferenc Fricsay was not what a modern listener would expect.  I for one did not expect such rich layers of different parts of the music to surface so vividly as they do here.<br />I have heard no less than a dozen recordings of this piece, mono or stereo or surround.<br />However, if you ask me for a clearest and most satisfying instrumental recording, this 1954 mono piece ranks high above all others!<br />Some people tend to think that it is a matter of technology - the mono sound having reached its full bloom by 1954.<br />I am far less convinced by this 'theory'.  The recording engineer no doubt did his good job, but if the orchestra (and by that of course we include the all-important conductor) is less lucid in tonal balance, I bet we would not have had this marvel of a historical recording.<br />Fricsay, in short, dug really deep into the score. The division of labour of the various groups of instruments are heard to great clarity and utterly mind-blowing tonal balance.<br />In the choral pieces, the chorus and the orchestra achieved total collaboration.  The totality of the efforts are so overwhelming that the listener simply has no room to 'discover' how each soloist did.<br />If you did, you would probably discover that Fricsay had very wisely lined up two superb singers in the low category - the bass and the alto.<br />The mezzo-soprano part really benefits from an alto's contribution in this Requiem, especially when there is no Verdian mezzo to fill this important role (compare the recent Barenboim line up of a light-weight lyrical mezzo that really could not deliver the work's demands sufficiently). On the other hand, both the tenor and soprano are just fine, and did nothing to impair the great total performance.  The ensemble work among the soloists and chorus is amazingly outstanding.<br />But at the end of the day, the greatest credit must go to Fricsay, who dug up all the drama and inner spirituality of the score.  The chorus sounded like a huge shed of laser light from heaven, while the orchestra pumps firy earthen tones to meet with the heavenly forces.  The soloists soared between the two big abysses with dramatic intensity and total emotional committment.<br />A great Verdi Requiem.he drama and inner spirituality of the score.

B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I was worried I wouldn't like this album because the band said they were inspired by classic metal bands like pantera and that's not my cup of tea. There are some classic metal elements and sounds but I think it all is still very A7X. There are some songs that remind me of their other albums and I really like those ones the best. All in all, I'm a die hard fan and definitely not disappointed. I look forward to hearing these songs live in a few weeks
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Let me put it this way, the show engaged me enough to continue watching free on Amazon, however, I soon forgot to keep watching as the new shows aired on BBC, and it's not compelling enough for me to now pay Amazon in order to catch up. I'll wait till it's free.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Let me start by saying that I'm ADDICTED to this game. Seriously, I play it nearly constantly. I got it as FAOTD, but I'm glad now that I didn't pay for it. There are small inconveniences, like when I'm playing in stationary camera mode and it won't let me select a block behind a block even though I can see it enough to know that it's the block I need to win the game. That's fine; I'll count it as a win anyway.<br /><br />However, I tried to play it on an airplane last week and was informed that it needs an internet connection to work. WHAT?!?! My kindle does not have service, so I use my hotspot - which is not always on. I've never gotten this message before. I get that Open Feint needs a connection, but does anyone actually care about it? This is a paid app that I was looking forward to entertaining myself with on my flights. Add an out, devs!

B00BT70IWS|5.0|We see that with his new record company Sony, star tenor Jonas Kaufmann's new `Verdi Album' gets a slightly more controversial reception than his earlier albums.<br /><br />The choice of programme from 11 different Verdi operas ranging from the earlier period to the late period demands quite a range of `Verdian' interpretation.  It can be fairly said that this range of compositions presents a real challenge - to any tenor, Verdian or not.  Verdi is a prolific and long living composer.  The stylistic changes over his compositions spans decades.<br /><br />Hitherto we have heard Kaufmann in a solo album dedicated to Italian verismo opera.  That album scored a resounding success.  Here, with a programme of long-spanning Verdi compositions, the vocal challenge is arguably considerably bigger than that verismo programme.<br /><br />To put it honestly, fast approaching his mid-forties this year when this programme was recorded (March 2013), Kaufmann has reached the pinnacle of his vocal capacity.  This is already evident in his last Wagner album, as I have pointed out in my review `there'.  The timbre has traded power for flexibility, though not quite yet to the extent of Mario del Monaco in the latter part of his career.  If one has gotten used to the Verdi style of Luciano Pavarotti, one may exclaim at Kaufmann's much darker and smoky sound; and if one is accustomed to the gleaming tone of a Carlo Bergonzi and an early Carreras, one would tend to find Kaufmann's tone on the hoarse side. Nor is Kaufmann's Verdi like that of Placido Domingo.  In short, Kaufmann is an unique tenor in this genre of opera works.<br /><br />Evidently, Kaufmann's voice sits far better in some tracks than others in this varied Verdi programme.  The first one to emerge as a winner is the `Celeste Aida', followed by `Ah! Si ben mio...Di quella pira'.  Considerably less successful are the opening `La Donna Mobile', a piece calling for bel canto lyricism as well as reckless abandon, both of which Kaufmann do not own in good quantities.  The `Un Ballo' excerpts prove that Kaufmann is no bel canto singer.  The lyrical musical lines are smudged and traded for power.  It is true that very few tenors, even Verdian tenors, can bring home this role in `Un Ballo'.  So there is no cause for dismay if Kaufmann does not outshine his predecessors here.<br /><br />An interesting take is the `Luisa Miller' scene, with an overtly powerful recitative followed by a more flowing aria.  It is exactly in such places that Kaufmann's limitations in this type of Verdian repertoire surface - a lack of flexibility to handle the `big swing' of expressivity.<br /><br />Of the lot, the title role in `Don Carlo' is probably what suits Kaufmann best.  The tragically doomed character offers sympathetic aura to the dark and smoky timbre of Kaufmann.  This may be particularly true if the First Act (Fontainbleau Act) is being cut out, as in most performances of this opera.<br /><br />The less performed Verdi opera `La Forza' is another work that would suit Kaufmann to a `T'.  The violence-packed plot, the dramatically violent clashes between the protagonists, the overtly tragic outcome, all provide a good showcase platform for Kaufmann's unique timbre. Again, among the earlier Verdi opera, `Il Masnaderi' may rank as one more suitable to Kaufmann's vocal temperament.<br /><br />Otello and Macbeth are works that one really looks forward to see and hear Kaufmann perform in the near future.  Kaufmann really could not do wrong with these two works.<br /><br />As a passing remark, Kaufmann is not unItalianate in the sense of Jussi Bjorling in this Verdi programme.  Rather, his baritonal timbre smacks of the Italian dramatic tenor Giuseppe Giacomini (born 1940).  The fact that despite his immense musical intelligence and vocal accomplishment, Giacomini has never been considered a top-notch Verdian tenor does tell quite some thing about what sort of timbre really suits Verdi best in an all-rounded sense.  Be that as it may, even a Pavarotti was not, in his lifetime, a first choice for roles like Otello.  In a composer of such vastly different outputs, one can really count on Kaufmann to up hold the Verdian banner in the composer's later and more dramatic works.nse.

B00DJZR46G|1.0|So who keeps convincing 70's pop/rock icons that \\"getting back to  their roots\\" means weak melodies and ultra-sparse arrangements that were never reflective of their early music???<br /><br />This doesn't sound anything like the Elton John we've all grown to love and admire over the past 40+ years.  Nothing on this album even remotely resembles Elton's career-best \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" or more recent triumphs like \\"Captain & The Kid,\\" or jaw-dropping beautiful \\"Original Sin.\\"<br /><br />Nope. What you get here are SHOCKINGLY weak melodies that lack the kind of arrangements that may have resuscitated some of these songs.  (Elton, we know you can play piano, but someone needs to tell you that, well, no one cares!  We just want infectious, fun, and emotive melodies and your wonderful voice.)<br /><br />And even when the album gets it right with \\"Home Again\\" (a truly nice song), the second half of the arrangement has some strange kind of cat purring or snoring sound in the background that puts a damper even on this.<br /><br />I was so excited for a new Elton John album, this was truly disappointing from such a talented songwriter/singer.

B008MM9630|1.0|I played and enjoyed this game for over 6 months.  The problem is that when I purchased a female dragon it never appeared in the game.  I had purchased many things before this and never had a problem before.  I emailed the game pdevelopers to no avail.  After 4 months, I have yet to hear from them about a refund or actually getting the dragon I paid for.  Eventually, after the last update about 2 months ago, my game would not open at all so I finally uninstalled it.  Very poor customer service.  I am out $19.99 for the dragon I never received and now have even lost the entire game.  After investing actual money in this game, I am disgusted that there is nothing to show for it.

B00F4PVFE6|5.0|I can't say too much how much I enjoyed this series. Unlike most murder dramas, this story isn't about autopsies and gunfights. It's about human nature. It's about the tragedy of the murder of a child. It's about the court of public opinion, the sinister nature of irresponsible journalism, the failures, frailties and flaws of our fellow human beings. This is 'Shakespeare writes a detective story'.<br /><br />Chris Chibnall has now gone to the top of my list as a writer. It was beautifully done. In no way has he broken the cardinal rule of show, don't tell. Nor has he made the horrible mistake of creating any perfect character. All of them, from youngest to oldest, are wonderfully imperfect human beings, and with no character is this more obvious than our protagonist, DI Alec Hardy, masterfully played by David Tennant as the world-weary detective with secrets of his own and a shadowy past. He is so wonderfully written by Chibnall and executed by Tennant that we find ourselves won over by a character that on the surface is quite unlikable. Tennant's performance has, IMO, overshadowed his role in Doctor Who with this work. He has proven before that he's far more than the Tenth Doctor. With his Hardy, he made me forget about all other roles.<br /><br />Olivia Colman, too, is wonderful. Her character enjoys a growth that's wonderful to behold. Colman is as good as any actress out there. I've seen her before, but with her Ellie Miller, she has captured me completely.<br /><br />In fact not a single actor or actress was badly chosen. From eldest to youngest and male and female, all of them turned in sterling performances. Even the dog! I was especially pleased with Arthur Darvill. Young Adam Wilson, who played Tom Miller, was quite impressive as well.<br /><br />This series is what TV should look like. This is what The Killing should have looked like. This is TV at it's finest. The story arc was magnificent, centered, not on procedurals and junk science-based CSI (actual CSI is nothing like what's shown on TV) but on the tragedy of it, and how that tragedy bled into the lives of the people of Broadchurch, itself, even the ones investigating it. The dialog was wonderful, especially the banter between Hardy and Miller, whose polar-opposite natures should have been cliche, yet were pulled off masterfully by Colman and Tennant. Hardy's subplot was simply divine. We find out why he is so world-weary, yet, in the end are still left with the mystery of him, and know he is Broadchurch's greatest mystery still. Little touches, like the 'love thy neighbor' signs add further richness and poignancy and lend the tale yet more humanity. Rich in character development, beautifully photographed, the series ended in a perfect denouement. And the best part is we are left wanting more, which is the mark of a truly great story.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Funny show and good depiction of high school and teenage life. Actors are talented and very good writing. Lots of laughs.
B00FFVML74|5.0|Yes, as many have pointed out, the first episode started out slow, but the series is well worth pushing through that. The characters have depth and lots of secrets to discover. The story has many twists. It's a great study in how tragedy can effect a community and uncover things that perhaps should stay in the past.

6305511055|5.0|\\"Three Days of the Condor\\" from 1975 is tops in the \\"conspiracy\\" thriller genre that formed around that time and gives Robert Redford one of his best films.  In CIA agent, \\"Joe Turner\\" (AKA: \\"Condor\\") Redford has one of his most likeable characters.  The film is effectively directed by Sydney Pollack who would work with Redford many times, including later on \\"Out of Africa\\" where Redford's character was over-shadowed by Meryl Streep's.  The script of \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" is based on a book by James Grady and written by Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (\\"Pretty Poison\\" and TV's \\"Batman\\") and David Rayfiel.  The film is somewhat dated, but quite relevant even now and makes riveting entertainment at any age.  Also excellent in the film are Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow.  The Paramount film is widescreen and in Technicolor.
B000007ODL|5.0|I have always liked JJ Cale from many years back.<br />He wrote some great songs with good lyrics.<br />He will be missed
B004W1GCNC|3.0|This was very intriguing, but the story line was a little off at times. I really enjoyed Downton Abbey and was looking for something to replace is while it is off air in the U.S. This was not nearly as good as Downton Abbey, but the story was interesting when it included the main characters.

B00BEJOMIW|4.0|There are numerous film versions of the book as we all know, but I must weigh in with my vote on the often questioned casting of Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 Jack Clayton version.  Together, the couple make this, perhaps difficult to film, book work.  Francis Ford Coppola, who wrote this version's screenplay, also wrote a screenplay for the film version of Carson McCullers' \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" that was shopped to the cast as the screenplay that was to be used, but the director, John Huston, had another author, less prolific, John Chapman Mortimer and his own associate, Gladys Hill do the final screenplay.  Coppola's script for \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" for which he deserves a lot of the credit for making the film a success, is excellent, showing Coppola to be the great cineaste that he has become.  Also very good in the 1974 production are the performances by Karen Black and even Scott Wilson, who seems to generally overact a lot, but in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" he is effective for his interaction.  Robert Redford is perfectly cast as \\"Gatsby\\" as is Mia Farrow as \\"Daisy.\\"  It is almost unbelievable, knowing of their careers in Hollywood, that they could make the Fitzgerald book work so well.  If \\"The Great Gatsby\\" could be realized on film, then the 1974 Paramount version comes very close to doing it best.  The Blu-ray version is great, turning another chapter for this production, which was greatly publicized in 1974, especially for fashion, if you remember.  The direction, script and casting glow.

B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this season. I was frustrated by certain developments, but it is more realistic rather than idealistic. Love the music, love the voices, love the actors.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan Scott is a truly likable character. She believes that she is unable to love due to past relationships but she wants a baby even if she has to go to a sperm bank. She has a plan. Conner Reed want a family without the emotional ties to a woman. After meeting for one night in Vegas and a Vegas drunk weeding, he has what he believes he wants. Can they live without love when the connections between them is undeniable? Read and find out!<br /><br />Loved this book and will be looking for the authors other books.
B001F4TUCY|5.0|Absolutely incredible! Natalie has one of the most amazing voices ever recorded. This album is up there with one of those albums that one must have in their collection. And listening to it on vinyl, pressed from the original master analog tapes absolutely stunning a must must have for any person collecting vinyl or wants to hear this music how it should be for the first time!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I somehow knew straight off that Me Before You was going to rip my heart out with a grapefruit spoon. I barely knew anything about it other than the rave reviews, and when it popped up on Netgalley, I snatched up the opportunity and crammed it into my busy reading schedule. And am I ever glad I did. This novel is an unforgettable roller coaster ride, one which I devoured in a few short days.<br /><br />I sobbed for a half an hour after finishing this book. I NEVER do this. I may leak a few tears, sometimes even have some streaming, but sobbing, streaming and blubbering for thirty minutes? Never. I can only say that at no time could I predict the outcome of this one, which was fantastic. No more will be said, but just that this book is probably not for the faint at heart or for people that do not like to feel things because this one make you feel everything.<br /><br />Me Before You tackles heavy subject matter, which I loved, yet there are humourous moments which keep it easy to read, and Moyes manages to keep an overall lighthearted feel, the effect of which is marvelous. This could have been a depressing, difficult read, but Moyes humanizes this controversial subject matter by making it relatable with two incredible characters. Regardless of which side of the issue you stand on, and what outcome you want in the end, Me Before You is eye opening and definitely makes you think.<br /><br />Lou and Will are two of the most fantastic characters I have had the honor to read about in ages. I grew attached to Lou instantly. A simple girl - you won't find any Louboutins in this book - her heart steals the show. How selfless she is accepting a job she didn't want to help save her family home and how compassionately she looks after Will is almost overwhelming. I wanted her to stick up a bit more for herself, but at the same time, I didn't want her to change that much because she was so kind, caring, and compassionate. I was desperate for her to ditch her icky boyfriend and find her path in life, particularly hoping it would wind around to Will. Ahhh, Will. Insert huge sigh here. I loved him, and I grew desperate for him to accept his new position in life and move on - and prayed it would be with the lovely Lou. I adored watching their relationship blossom. These are two characters I will never, ever forget.<br /><br />Oh, just go get this book now. You won't regret it. Promise.<br /><br />And please, someone make this one into a movie - because I'd like to have my heart shattered all over again.<br /><br />Thank you to Viking for our review copy. All opinions are our own.

140006922X|5.0|This is a beautifully written historical account of Jesus of Nazareth. The notes and research are very impressive. Information about Herod the Great and his son Antipas &#34;the Fox&#34; was interesting to me. Also the conflict between Paul of Tarsus and James the brother of Jesus was informative. A Wonderful book.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great selection of noise options, ranging from usual (rain storms) to downright strange (toads).  You can even mix your own noises to come up with your personal sounds.  I use timer option and the app shuts down after an 1 hr of use.  The digital clock and alarm feature is an added bonus.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|An old German Solingen steel diamond studded retractable spike sharpener lost some of its effectiveness after some 40-50 years.  No replacements were its equal until now.  The Smith's PP1 is the best ever!  As advertised online, swipe the knife blade 8 or less times (usually) on the carbide blades, then the same number on the ceramic set - and your knife is razor sharp; equal or better to using a sharpening block, wheel, or sharpening sticks.  And this fits neatly and snag free in one's pants pocket!  I have now purchased several for family and friends.
1608871452|5.0|Great book, lots of fun facts and goodies. Was a gift for my teen daughter who has read a total of 3 books in her life including this one so it's a winner.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Joe Abercrombie has definitely improved over the journey. Where the First Law books were great, they also lacked for variety in language and became a tad formulaic. This is a much more mature effort and one that introduces compelling new characters, both good and bad, and sees the continuing appearances of old favourites. Couldn't put it down
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness shows us once again why J.J. Abrahams was perfect to direct Star Trek.  If he brings the same level of quality to the new Star Wars films, then both Star Trek and Star Wars fans are in for a treat for the next several years.  Into Darkness was a great and thrilling film like the 2009 Star Trek film was.  I, personally, like the first film a little better for one reason, which I will get to.  However this is still an experience you must see in the theater.<br /><br />The characters are the same from the first movie with a couple new additions.  The crew of the enterprise is still very fun to watch and work off of each other brilliantly.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto still do great as Kirk and Spock.  I love the development and growth that this movie gave to both characters.  Kirk comes to realize that there are consequences of his rash actions.  Kirk seems much more like a captain in this film.  He is still a bit reckless and hot-headed, but he comes off as much more mature than the last film, which I think is nice.  Spock finds himself conflicted with following protocol and being human.<br /><br />I really like how both character arcs are presented and how they are resolved.<br />The rest of the actors give fantastic performances as well.  We are introduced to a new crew member, Carol Marcus, played by Alice Eve.  She does a good job.  I do not mind her.<br /><br />The villain, however, I have some issue with.  Benedict Cumberbatch as Kon did not do it for me.  He is not bad, and I know he had big shoes to fill.  However, compared to Ricardo Montalban as Kon, Benedict just falls short, in my opinion.  He is the reason why I do not like this film as much as the 2009 film.<br /><br />The effects look gorgeous.  They are every bit as eye-pleasing as the first film, if not more so.  I cannot comment on the 3D, since my theater does not show movies in 3D.  The action is awesome and intense.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must see for those who loved the 2009 film like I did.  I f possible, see this film in theaters.  It is worth the money.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey has managed something very few classical instrumentalist (especially as young as she is) have managed, she's successfully taken her training with her violin, obvious flawless classical chops, and somehow has added electronica, vocal choruses, syncopated rhythms to craft her own unique interpretative style. She's got original tunes as well as haunting, massively geek worthy covers of some famous video game themes.<br />If you like modern instrumental stuff, I think you may really enjoy Lindsey Stirling.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Well paced story, constructed on the back of strong characters, leading to an unexpected twist of the tale at the end. I'm ready to move on to &#34;The Redeemer&#34;.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|Iron Man 3 is the first installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2 (Post Avengers. Personally, I think they are off to a strong start. Iron Man 3 is a highly entertaining move and a major improvement to the previous Iron Man installment. The story is competent and engaging, the characters are well developed, the action will get your blood pumping, and the villains are also good, for the most part. There are problems, that bring the movie down for me slightly though. Most of the problems are nitpicks, but one might be a major turn-off for viewers. In my opinion, Iron Man 3 is vastly superior to Iron Man 2, but not quite as good as the first Iron Man.<br /><br />The story is quite interesting and executed much more competently then in Iron Man 2. The story deals with demons from Tony's past come back to bite him in the present. Tony is also plagued by panic attacks from the fight in New York in Avengers. Tony must find a way to defeat his demons before they hurt those he cares for. Unlike Iron man 2 I actually felt Tony's plight, and the big threat is actually legitimate. The story was quite good, though I personally prefer the story too the first Iron Man more. The main characters are the same as the first two films. Tony is back and has a new dilemma he has to face. Unlike the second film, I actually felt for Tony. Tony came off as too arrogant in the second film and made so many stupid decisions that I found myself kind of not liking him until the end. In this film, while still arrogant, I find Tony much more sympathetic and he is actually being smart in this film.<br /><br />Pepper's character, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is more in line with what she was in the first Iron Man, which is a good thing. In Iron Man 2 all she did was nag Tony. In this she is much less annoying, and actually serves the plot. She even helps Tony in the end like in the first film.<br /><br />Rhodey, played again by Don Cheadle is also better in this film. He has much more to doin this film then in the previous films, which is a plus. Though, I wish Rhodey had more time in the suit doing things. The rest of the cast did a fine job for the most part.<br /><br />The villains very good and quite refreshing! Unlike Iron Man 2 the villains, for the most part, can be taken seriously. Plus the villains feel like an actual threat, not a minor inconvenience like the villains in Iron Man 2. Plus it is refreshing that the big threat at the end is not another version of the Iron Man technology.<br /><br />The effects are great as always. The humor is a ton better this time around. The action is one of this movie's strongest points. One thing I did not like about the previous two films is that the action scenes. The action was too short and anticlimactic, especially the final battle. However, in this movie, the action is very ramp up. The final battle is actually satisfying. The film does have a couple problems that do bring it down a little for me. Firstly, the middle was a bit slow passed. The moments with the kid I did not care for that much. The big issue for me is a twist that comes half way through the film. This twist might piss lots of people off. When I learned of the big twist, even I was like: \\"What..really?\\" The twist did not ruin the film for me, but it might for some people, particularly fans of the Iron Man comic.<br /><br />Overall this is a great addition to the Iron Man franchise. It definitely makes up for Iron Man 2. I highly recommend this!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|OneRepublic does what they do best with this album, catchy tunes and riffs, its musically complex (there's a string section, not just guitar, base, keyboard and drums) has varied melodies and styles and thoughtful, even poetic lyrics.  Its all those things a great pop/folk rock song should be.  His voice is clear and perfect for the words and music.  These songs get lodged in my brain and I'm delighted to have them there.<br />If you like Matt Nathanson, Lighthouse,  or Parachute OneRepublic is definitely for you.<br />Enjoy!

B000026KGC|5.0|After having bought several turkeys I was pleased to find that EMI Europe had finally done this great album justice. All the other versions of this have sounded like they were mastered though a 60's transistor radio. This one reminds me of why I kept searching for a good copy, buy it !!!
0486409511|5.0|I took a copperplate class and it was frighteningly fast and messy (from a handwriting perspective). A friend suggested this book, and it was fantastic. The entire book was dedicated to teaching the art of writing copperplate. I found it extremely helpful. The step-by-step instruction was fantastic. I highly recommend this for those learning to write copperplate, but I do not recommend it for those who have mastered it. Great for refreshers or beginners.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I have some knowledge of working with energy and always believe that there is a direct link between our thoughts / desires/ energy and what happens to us in our life. The book is written in such a way as to break it down for those who are beginning to delve into this concept and work with it.  Over all it was a good book, but for me, I found myself skipping most of the writing and going straight for the exercises and workings at the end of the chapters.<br />I liked it and gave it 4 stars for the exercises but would have given it three stars or less if the exercises were absent.
B008JFUN50|2.0|Let me preface this with personal info: I AM a sci-fi fan, love action movies and was looking forward to seeing this movie.<br />But when you are watching the movie and checking your watch to see how much longer this thing is going to last...you know it is a dud.<br />Matt Damon was dull and had no spark. It felt link he was just going thru the paces to get the paycheck.<br />The initial \\"setup the story\\" part was about 15 minutes too long. He goes to work and goes home and goes to work and goes home --we got it already!<br />My friend who went to the movies with me, got up to get us hot dogs just to have something interesting to do.<br />Then she went to the bathroom. Then she figgetted.<br />And as for it having some deep social message - phfft. Some people have money and can get top of the line treatment and some people are poor and cannot. period. it always has been this was and always will. I suspect even cavemen had a pecking order.<br />So save your money and your popcorn for something more entertaining, cause this movie won't do it.
B00C9QQBA6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Personally, I like the way the author only gives enough details and information to paint the scenes and characters without going on and on. I don't like getting bogged down in details when it's not necessary. For me, the author does a perfect job of giving you just enough.<br />I also think she did an outstanding job of weaving fact with fiction. Keeping a fairly fast pace, the characters were very likeable, and I was caught up in their plight right away. I was already very familiar with the real incident that happened in Aurora, Texas, but she made it come completely alive with the characters and their interactions with the real life event.<br />I simply love the way she wove her characters around it. The book is short, and it ends on a nail biting cliffhanger. Ahhhhh!! Was my response, lol, I HAVE to get the next book! I can only imagine what Emily is going to have to go through to- well, I'm not telling you, lol, but I just know it's going to be good!<br />If you're a sci-fi fan, this series- in fact, all of the the author's books, will please you immensely. If you have never considered yourself a sci-fi reader, she'll change your mind! Her books changed mine!<br />I'm also reading the Dark Days series from this author. A series I also have to highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!!!!  however after update I found out that if I turned off my wifi on my kindle fire it works soooo much better! I don't have to wait for it to download or be stuck on the screen that still downloading. This is the only solution I have for people who have the kindle fire and want to continue to play this game. :)
B003L9CMNU|4.0|This is a great movie that has it all money, lies, sex, and a story. Plus it has the feel that only movies from the 80s can have.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I started this book, then began to wonder how it ever made it to the  best sellers list. I expected funny- but became more disappointed as time went on. No- I did not care for this book-at all.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Roger Ebert has said that he has never heard a serious film critic say a bad word about this film.  (Incidentally, this edition of &#34;Casablanca&#34; includes an excellent full-length commentary by Ebert.)  The acting, the dialogue, the setting and the pacing of this wartime drama combine to produce an outstanding cinematic experience.  A must-see movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is very addictive. That squirrel gets me every time. It is a very enjoyable game and fun to play.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I am a big fan of DT since Images and Words, but there was something missing in this album.  I really enjoyed several of the tracks (Enemy Inside, Behind the Veil, and Bigger Picture and the epic Illumination Theory is just cream), but there were a couple that sounded cheesy/ Falling into Infinity cheesy.  I listened to the album several times via the streaming set and finally opted to order the whole album (mostly because Illumination Theory was well worth it). You can hear bits of old album sounds throughout this record and definitely a distinct difference between Portney w DT days (arguably a better sound and song set). With the last couple with Portney, I would really enjoy one or two of the tracks and the rest were ok. On the other hand, this album and Dramatic Turn of Events have maybe one or two tracks that are ok with the rest being stocked with as some call it \\"chocolate cake\\".  There is much here to enjoy from heavy metal, real prog metal, musicianship, strong arrangements and more.
B001KT6JPA|2.0|Since this movie is a classic, I decided to finally watch it. I didn't really enjoy the movie at all since the movie didn't really make sense. I don't understand how no one can catch one old guy.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I bought the camera for my husband a few months back and he really enjoyed it but was complaining about the fact that he couldn't see the videos/pictures that he just took and since he rarely downloads the &#34;stuff&#34; onto the computer he would reach the point of running out of memory space and wishing he could go back and delete some material to free more space... so now he can finally do that, and the kids always love to see their performance once it is filmed and the touch screen is easier to opporate than the camera buttons, so it just made the camera so much better.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I use to own an art gallery so this game is right up my alley! I am so hooked on it. I already bought 2 museums and working on the 3rd.  It's like a weird HO game in that you have to find snippets of paintings in the ones you are trying to sell or buy in order to get the best price for it. You are always looking for special pieces that are requested therefore a sure profit.  There is a lot to this so it keeps you on your toes.  Great job on this one!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Yes, it was depressing in parts but it was still outstanding reading. I learned about the language of flowers that i never knew anything about. Also, the ending was uplifiting.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Got this for my wife and she really likes it.  Enjoys all the music on the CD.  If she's happy with it, I'm happy with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just adore this book! By far one of the best! It was filled with excitement, tragedy, and love. It was also very well written!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I would like to request that some info be clearer, i.e. how to get gift codes. Where do they come from?
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is my &#34;go-to&#34; game when waiting in line. It's well written with good graphics and animiation. I love it!
B00F91H666|2.0|Brad Pitt vs zombies, at least he can feed his family after this. Not exactly his finest work, but it looks cool.
B000006OS2|5.0|Got several John Wayne movies for my mom to watch now that she has a harder time getting around. She can crank up her TV volume and sit real close to enjoy the movies she once could watch form across the room. Only needs help getting DVD in player, and getting it started. Not bad for an eighty three year old hard of hearing and nearly blind old-ster!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent read that provides a truthful, non embellished, account of the Osama Bin Laden raid and an understanding of the mentality and sacrifices necessary to be a SEAL.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Got them in the time they indicated when I ordered them.  No problems.  So far is it a very good read.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson is thorough proof that Sanderson can write kick-butt dystopia and YA! Steelheart has all the awesome elements of YA dystopia and the wonderful plot twists that I've come to expect from Sanderson. While I expect plot twists, I never seem to be able to figure out all of them. I ended up staying up two hours later than I planned to while finished Steelheart because I just couldn't stop reading. The ending was edge-of-your-seat-amazing. I'm very excited for the rest of this trilogy and highly recommend Steelheart to Sanderson fans and YA dystopia fans (you will become Sanderson fans after this one!). Thank you so much to my friend Krys for lending me her ARC! Steelheart is scheduled to be published September 24, 2013!<br />Note: I read an advanced copy of Steelheart, so there may be changes in the final version.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />Super-powers without super-heroes??? Craziness! Steelheart's premise is a chilling reinterpretation of the comic book heroes we are more familiar with and begs the question of why. Why did these powers show up? Why is everyone who has powers cruel and unjust? Don't worry, Steelheart has hints of answers, and I trust Sanderson to reveal more of this awesome world in the rest of the trilogy.<br />One of Steelheart's powers is to turn every inanimate object to steel. For example all of Chicago.... This makes for an intriguing setting for Steelheart, because tunnels have been dug into the steel ground by a digging power. The grass of playgrounds becomes pretty dangerous when it is turned to steel, quite pokey!<br />The plot twists! I had suspicions about one of them, but then there were more and more that I didn't see coming, so epic! ;-)<br />David is an exceedingly sympathetic character. He is admittedly bad at metaphors, and so his first person narrative is sprinkled with attempts at metaphors that are hilariously bad. This adds the perfect touch of humor to an otherwise pretty depressing dystopian world.<br />There is also an adorkable crush ;-). David is such the typical teenage boy who thinks a girl is pretty but can't figure out what to do about it, haha.<br />The rest of the Reckoners team had other awesome personalities. This includes Cody, the \\"Scotsman\\" who is quite eager to tell you all about bagpipes (you have to hunt your own dragon and unicorn to make a set), leprechauns (his family had to steal one from Ireland), and all sorts of other \\"Scottish\\" traditions ;-).<br />If you haven't read any Sanderson before, trust me when I say that his writing is fantastic. If you have read Sanderson before, you know what I mean. There aren't boring descriptions, but you also will be clued into just the right amount of information to have a running movie in your brain. There is just something satisfying about reading writing like that.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />The prologue is sooooo sad. There was ugly crying on my part, so probably start Steelheart not in a public place >.>.<br />If you are looking for heavy romance, you will be disappointed. There may be a slow burn romance brewing over multiple books, and there is moving devotion between team members that could be something more, but there isn't the full blown romance that many YA novels have. (I was okay with this, I just figure some of you might not be as happy about it.)<br />Not enough answers D: I wanna know what Calamity is! I guess I'll just have to wait for the next book, haha.<br /><br />Summary:<br />I get all bouncy and excited whenever I talk about Steelheart to my friends now. I am just so excited at the new take on super-powers, the chilling dystopian world of which we are just scratching the surface, and all the answers yet to come! Steelheart was just so much fun to read in the way that dystopias are the best setting for truly epic battles between good and evil. It was especially cool that Steelheart's main character doesn't have some special power all his own, he's just a regular guy trying to make this screwed up world better (and get revenge, but he can do both at the same time!). While Steelheart left a lot of questions as to what is really happening in the world, it also laid the ground work for a truly epic trilogy. (It's so hard to avoid the word epic in this review, haha!)ke this screwed up world better (and get revenge, but he can do both at the same time!).

B00395ZYVS|5.0|Any adoptive parent or adoptee would appreciate the complexities and heart wrenching details written in the pages of this story.
8866137472|2.0|I liked the functionality of this product. I appreciate that there are dates on one side of the page for the week to make quick plans and a note section on the other page for more detailed information.  I think the Peanuts theme of the planner is really cute and I like the size of the planner itself, it'll fit in any size purse, it's very convenient that way.<br />My problem with this planner and for me it's a deal breaker, is that the paper is very thin, you can see through it.  That' means that every time you write something down on one side it gets jumbled up with what's on the other side of the page. It's difficult to read and you can't use a heavy pen or it'll bleed right through.  That's a pretty big flaw to me.
B005LAII4E|4.0|The movie was pretty good but I'm a big fan of the Rock and Channing Tatum so I'm pretty biased :-)
B004XISI4A|5.0|If you do nothing else for the rest of your days make sure you read all the books in the Game Of Thrones series.<br />They are the best books I have every read and the only books I have ever read twice.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I was entertained. I hadn't realized that I was watching a story based on history. Ended up doing more research and the show  kept the historical facts but delivered it in a sexy and entertaining format.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, the negatives.<br /><br />Okay, now to the positives.<br />What a refreshing change from the same ole detective stories, etc. This is a refreshing idea and I see that other authors are writing around this same theme.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Fun and exciting!  I also liked that it had a lot more Tony Stark outside of his Iron Man suit.  Can't wait for the next one!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I loved this book, because I had watched the TV series I started with this book and read all the following books. I THEN went back and read the first book and am now reading them all again. This is the only book I have ever read twice in my whole life.I just can't wait for the last 2 books in the series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When I first received my Chromecast, it would freeze while using my phone or my tablet. It has since been updated and works splendidly. I have all three of the popular streaming devices and it works the best. Netflix and Hulu which are our primary television services, are very clear and the remote function (using your phone as a remote) is very convenient.<br /><br />In comparison to the other devices, the Chromecast is more reliable. You don't have to worry about losing a remote. It plays youtube videos perfectly which is something that I never thought I'd use but I end up using frequently. I also like that you can broadcast your chrome from your computer to the television another thing I never thought I'd use but use all the time. I own one and plan on buying another to take with me for when we travel.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|What's not to love?  I wanted the song and bought it!  And since I could not find it on ITunes, this was great!
B000VOC90Y|2.0|I had a zipper break in half the first week I had it, I lost another one, and I just had to sew the bottom back together.  There was about a 3 inch gap after awhile.  Poor quality
067144901X|3.0|I know it's a strange thing to say about a 10 page board book but I was a bit disappointed with the story in this one.<br /><br />It starts great - a cow goes moo, a sheep says baa, 3 singing pigs say La! La! La!<br /><br />Wonderful!  A parody of the tiresome animal sounds books!  And a message about being yourself!  Or so I thought...<br /><br />But then it's back to 'wrong, wrong' and we hear how dogs go bow wow and cats meow.  I probably wouldn't mind if my hopes hadn't been raised for something a bit more clever and subversive.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I know this is not a special version, but the quality of the box can be really way better, it bends really easy, and the printing image is far from excellent, thankfully the movie has no issues, BD don't know yet, wont try scratching it just for a review :p
B00701L5XS|4.0|It makes things easier to explain and actually do. I got it because I am a Scout Leader and the boy's depend on me to teach them correctly!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am very satisfied with ebay. they are reliable, honest and always on time with product they send out.<br />Will continue to shop on ebay.<br />AAA+++
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Good story and characters but with a predictable ending. The story moves along nicely and you hope there is not  more people like this out there..
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|after watching the show and finding out that they had a soundtrack i was so excited and HAD to buy this.<br />excellent addition to the show, and great songs to sing to.<br />highly recommend
B00F91H666|5.0|We enjoyed this completely! It was a well done zombie movie. Rent it and see for yourself xxx xxx xxx
B00BU18U82|5.0|My son loves this game! He loves the combine and tracker and harvesting the crops! Create more games like this one!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Read non stop.  Great writer, amazing story. Will read every book this writer has written.  Total page turner. Loved it.
0316056898|5.0|I read this amazing book in the middle of the most hectic week of my life. I just want some quiet time with an amusing book and this &#34;Bossypants&#34; did a great job!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Cute, funny it was worth the time to watch it for sure! I often don't laugh out loud and this movie I did!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I love that this book is not all tech-speak.  It seems to really speak to me.  The conversational tone is appealing.  It is full of information without tons of scientific or caveman mumbo-jumbo.  When I was ready I found other sources for some more scientific information about specific topics.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|I listen to this album everyday an I enjoy listening to her because she is actually singing about something. Its just an amazing album.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the book and it kept me wanting to read it. Not a fan of how it ended but looking forward to the next book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great. doesn't freeze like other apps, and makes storage cleaning on my device very straightforward. A must have for original kindle fire devices.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This newer version is was at better, but equally addictive and frustrating.  I mean, why can I not just plat for 6 hrs straight?  I'm a big girl, I ate my veggies, and now I wanna destroy some bubbles...
1416589473|5.0|Very well written. Couldnt put it down and finished it in about 8 hours. great if you interested in the Foefire and the fall of Ascalon.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I love every track on this album! The story is mesmerizing, the music is flawless and in the flavor of the Soul Cages album, the lyrics tell  a story that often refers back to the stories of the Soul Cages, brilliant. Nice work, Sting, you are ever-evolving. Thank you.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I love this book... the chapter about Idea Generation is the best chapter for me.<br /><br />James cover a lot of topics, but I think the most important is learning how to use your brain and your inner equipment to get the life you want and choose for yourself.<br /><br />Becoming an idea generator and taking action on some of these ideas is basically the main principle I got from this book.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I collected all the Harry Potter movies.  It is Harry Potter - whats to say about it?  You are either a fan or not.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Great story, interesting characters, and fun to read. Casually but effectively brought Luxembourg and Paris to life while taking the reader through a tense, twisty turney plot.
B00795P4EG|5.0|Does what it says. Demo the trial version and see for yourself. Bought this for the full resolution edits. Awesome.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent story. Learned more about WW ll than I would reading history books. More fun for sure! Recommended this to all.
159463176X|3.0|I HAVE READ TWO OTHER BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR AND ENJOYED BOTH VERY MUCH SO I EXPECTED TO LOVE THIS ONE.  SOME CHAPTERS WERE VERY INTERESTING AND OTHERS SEEMED TO GO TOO DEEP AND TOO LONG.  IT DID COME TOGETHER AT THE END BUT I JUST WAS A LITTLE TIRED OF IT ALL BY THE TIME I GOT THERE.  THE BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN AND HAS AN INTERESTING THEME BUT I JUST COULDN'T STAY WITH IT.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|All in all the book was good. I had it figured out half way through though and that was a disappointment. But again it was a nice read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you guessing the whole time. Not sure about the ending, but overall loved the book. Defiantly recommend it before the movie comes out.
B00F5F0208|4.0|Cool album , different , but drake albums are always different. Still one of the top albums of 2013 #Mellow
B000FCK65W|5.0|Very good read!  I will miss Francie now!  Even though this took place a century ago, some issues are timeless!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Wonderful movie with lots of action. Just love the scenery in this movie kinda giving yo the idea what it would be like later
B00005UK1F|5.0|I have been an avid lover of progressive/concept rock for over 30 years, especially long tunes, but I do not know how I missed this epic song by Green Carnation for over 10 years since its first release. I came across it accidentally when I googled \\"long progressive rock songs\\". Usually, I am not lacking of words, but I cannot find the proper words to describe this phenomenal composition. You have in this one song a fusion of Pink Floyd, Genesis, ELP, Yes, Black Sabbath, and ambient New Age. Whatever your taste in progressive rock, you'll find it here somewhere.<br /><br />The song starts off gently with playful baby sounds in the background. Gradually the soft melody builds up to a crescendo of sustained eruptions of drums, guitar, and grunge vocals. We have this pattern repeated throughout the 60 minutes length of the song. Except that it's a different, highly appealing melody each time, each rhythm rising and falling in a beautiful weaving consistency. The transitions are also seamless.<br /><br />Then at about 34 minutes into the song, we are treated to a lovely solo, the haunting wailing of a woman in deep lamentation. Listen in silence and you journey with her in painful agony as her \\"ooooohs\\" and \\"aaaaahs\\" rise to the highest pitch, and fall to the deepest depth of her very soul, to the equally melancholic weave of a horn. This section lasts for about 5 minutes, but you don't feel the passage of time. Instead you emerge from it in harmony with her painful emotions.<br /><br />Towards the end at about 56 minutes, the song becomes more upbeat and you almost feel an emergence from darkness into light, like a triumphant return home from a long uncertain journey. The last minute is once again the sounds of a playful baby mingled with the soft rhythmic melody of baby toys.<br /><br />Ever since I discovered \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\" less than a week ago, I have listened to this 60 minute song entirely and repeatedly everywhere - in the car, at home, at work,and while running in the park. Each time, it ends too soon, like a 3 minute song.<br /><br />I have wondered what inspired Green Carnation to produce this masterpiece, especially considering they have not had any significant production before or after. However, I command you to go out and get this music now, if you have not already.<br /><br />I need not say more.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Terrible season, Showtime really did an injustice allowing such terrible writing to what could have been a great finale to a great show! Do yourself a favorite and stop watching at season 7!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My 5 year old son had never seen Star Wars (deprived, I know) and I couldn't let it go at the great price they were offering!  I definitely suggest watching it in creation order, not Episode order.  The original 3 just have to be watched first by a new Star Wars viewer!  For seasoned marathon watcher, in Episode order is preferred!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I was intrigued by the movie and how they were wanting to do the zombies compared to the usual fare, I was not overly disappointed.  I liked the cast and how their performance, Pitt does a great job in my opinion and I believe he is very fine actor and often unappreciated, often considered just a pretty face.  The movie has some interesting turns and twists but leaves some questions unanswered, like where did the virus come from? How are the undead able to sustain themselves since they don't eat their victims but simply turn them?  I would recommend renting and watching this movie but not necessarily to buy.
1250012570|5.0|I picked up this book and when I did I couldn't put it back down, it draws you in and carries you through to the very end.  It was a refreshing read.  I loved how beautifully it was written.  It had eloquence, humor, and above all simplicity.  In all honesty the story of Eleanor and Park has to be in my top 20 favorite reads.  Read it and you'll fall in love with these characters too and Rowell's effortless writing.
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|UPDATE 30Sep2013:<br />As a result of the below original review AnkerDirect contacted me and very diligently sent me a replacement hub.  Customer service is excellent so far.  Unfortunately, this new hub failed to work even out-of-the-box for any of the 3 devices I tried (USB 3.0 and 2.0 Flash and mechanical drives) where my ancient 2.0 hub works fine (except it is 3.0 speed).  So, it appears that this hub has a bus power DESIGN flaw.<br /><br />Original review:<br />This was a wonderful product while it was working.  I do not abuse equipment.  Generally it lasts longer than is useful.  But, this one just failed and now no devices I connect are detected on my MBA... Maybe it is an OSX issue since they are detected on my WInBlows system.  But, I did not buy this USB3.0 device to only use it on my USB 2 systems.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|The case is pretty cool and sleek looking, it doesn't thicken up your phone like some people mention, but the only downside about this case is because its leather when you bend the case to hold up the phone the leather bends and leaves a crease mark and its just unappealing to me. but over the case is good. a bit to pricey for it. should be like 15$ then it'd be better. I switched up to a best buy case 39.99 worth the money though and it has a kickstand.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing.  I don't use it all that much but when I do, it's sooooo convenient to have.  I had trouble connecting to my wifi the first time but it eventually caught on and connected.  I hear the more recent updates that Google has pushed out should correct those problems.
B008P9M614|5.0|The set was clean and brand spanking new! LOVE HOUSE so naturally I am just happy I have all the seasons and the DVDs all play :)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun and somewhat addicting.... there should be more ways to earn bingo coins while playing perhaps one of energy bonuses can be a coin. Otherwise it's good fun
B00APACSJG|5.0|I adore all the Miles Vorkosigan books, including his romance with Ekaterin. But I was delighted to read another book of his exploits written in more of a pre-Ekaterin style. Cryoburn definitely ranks up there with his most infamous adventures. Very highly recommended.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game is really fun it is the funnest gangster game I ever played it is better than gta yup.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|What more can I say about Rubinstein's playing? Superb! I bought this set when Amazon's price was about a dollar a disc. And it would have been a bargain at three times the price. Fortunately, my set had all of the discs and arrived in good shape (some others here have complained of missing discs). I've been listening to selections from the set over the past few days and the sound quality is superb. Generally, the jackets for the discs look good, though the minuscule liner notes on the back of each jacket are a bit \\"hazy\\" from improper scanning and digital image processing techniques and could have been printed more crisply. Also, the labeling of the discs themselves isn't the greatest: in a well-intnetioned but misguided attempt to recreate the original labels of the LPs, the producers of the set omitted any kind of disc numbers that would make it instantly clear which discs go with which jackets. Not a problem, I suppose, as long as you're careful and remove only one disc at a time and replace it promptly! Still, other recent \\"big box\\" sets managed to put a disc number on each CD that corresponds to the disc number in the booklet and on each jacket. The included book is handsome with some great photos and full discographical details for each disc. With individual Rubinstein discs retailing for around ten bucks a piece, if you intend to buy more than a few, you might as well buy this box and get them all!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book...quick read. Funny, sad,and romantic all rolled into one great little book. I think everyone would enjoy it !!

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo is so much fun!  I have previously taken Spanish, French, Japanese and Korean in college so I have a pretty good background in languages but have not spoken or translated anything in such a long time. Duolingo helped rebuild my vocabulary in French and Spanish. After I finish all the French lessons I will try German.
B00E00GCF8|5.0|This goes out to all the folks who have been wrongly saying that these guys lost their sound.  They are even better now with this line up than the Rust in Peace days.  Just completely unbelievable concert.  Made me feel like I was there!  The sound is great, Chris Broderick is a virtuoso, Mustaine's voice is as powerful as it ever was....  Wow... JUST WOW!  Buy this now.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Well written. Showed her struggles both physical and emotional.  Vivid pictures of characters that she met on the trail.  Also of the natural surroundings.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Completely disappointed in the season finale! Why oh why did it have to end that way? Couldn't Lady Mary just have some happiness for a while?<br />On another note, I love the story line with all of the servants! And where things are leading with Branson.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|A great finish to the Fae series. The twist and turns are endless and the suspense will keep you reading till the very end.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've watched the show on tv and loved it. Never really thought about reading the books, I'm not a big reader anyway. After season 3 and the big ending,I won't spoil anything,I knew I needed to read and get ahead of the show because I'm dying to know what happens. So if you like the show you'll love the books. Well worth the read, now I'm off to get the second book...

B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is a very visually appealing game, the characters and story are fun but the pacing is a bit strange. You can collect from your families almost constantly but the missions often bring the game to a dead halt as you wait for scrat to appear or your friends to send you gifts. Good game but not the best tapper  out there.

B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Maybe this is a good book, but it doesn't translate well to a movie. Maybe I'm missing something, but I didn't get it. I was waiting for a real 'Aha' moment throughout, but it never came. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you were a huge fan of the Wachowsky siblings, and even then you may be disappointed...
B008IJT0CE|3.0|You can clearly hear some of the color (white brown) noise tracks stop and restart instead of just playing continuously, other than that it offers a lot of variety, especially water sounds.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I was given this box set as a gift from a friend who already has it. I love these movies alot that I immediatly went out and bought the soundtrack. I am also reading the book right now. Peter Smith
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Another Disney money maker. Originally enjoyed building the reef until around level 14 with an update came an advertisement video that would play every time I started the app, before I could even get to the reef. Plus you are constantly solicited to make purchases to improve your reef. You can try and collect enough items without the purchase, but it becomes difficult to get very far without an eventual purchase. Very disappointing.
B0000A5BTL|1.0|Terrible! This is one of my family's all time favorites, but the disc is not formatted for play on American dvd players. Apparently, it is for European players which use a different frequency. Total waste of money... useless!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Started slow but was really good at the end.<br />This is a good read and worth it. I was told to read the rest of the series
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Iron Man 3 is a terrible film that lacks everything that made the first film so amazing. The villain's motivations are an exact duplicate of the Riddler's from the terrible Batman Forever film. In this film the main villain is heartbroken because Tony Stark stood him up for a date and didn't reciprocate his homosexual feelings. It makes very little sense why someone who barely knew Tony would be so hurt by him as to plot for nearly a decade to get his revenge. The failure here is the same as Mickey Rourke's villainous role in Iron Man 2; very little character development as to why they are so motivated to destroy Tony. i understand that Guy Pearce's character is upset because Tony is not homosexual but there has to be more as to why he would want to kill him. Another thing that was terrible was the little kid as a side kick, that was too cliche for me. the best part of the film is when they put tony's fat butler in a colma (his best contribution to the trilogy by far) and when i thought stupid Pepper Potts had died. I was so overwhelmed with joy i stood up out my seat full of happiness seeing stupid Pepper fall into the inferno...only to see her come back from the dead as phoenix from X-Men. Also the plot twist involving the Mandarin was stupid as they get. The whole time you think the guy is a super terrorist and he just turns out to be \\"the Dude\\" from the Big Lebowski film. Also the fact that the film makers had to change the Mandarin's character because of political correctness is just pathetic. Anyone that perceives the original comic book character as racist is just a sissified over sensitive dim witted wimp. It just comes across as utterly absurd...I mean really, a cowboy Texan sounding Asian Terrorist called the Mandarin?! Hollywood liberals and their lame and cowardly political correctness ruined the character. This film is complete and utter garbage.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I first saw this move in the theater and love it. Renting it from amazon was just as good as the theater.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the perfect calculator for me.  Size, functions, light, ease.  Couldn't ask for a better  calculator...does everything I need it to do.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It was great until other games came around.I hate how it requires Internet. But it is a fun game.I guess
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app works awesome for journaling late at night!!  I would highly recommend this for anyone needing a little or a lot of light.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I absolutely love how posable it is. The joints are all easily maneuverable and the interchangeable parts add to the variety. The only problem I have is that I got two of the same interchangeable faces. According to the instruction paper I am supposed to have one serious face with a tiara and one without, but instead I have two serious faces without tiaras. So aside from that mis-packaging, I love it.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This is well written and engaging. It is a real page-turner. My book club gave it the highest rating of all books read this year.
B00F8L2VO4|2.0|well...it's pretty...but the username I chose was taken so I was going to try another one but the create account button disappeared, and clicking the area it was in did nothing. so, I back out and tried again. now, the next button does nothing...doesn't even process. soooo I would love to use this app...but I can't.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|Not to be cliche this movie was a blast from the past loved it as a kid and was great to see again.  Thanks &#34;TED.&#34;
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I love this series and have ordered all 3 seasons from Amazon.  Alas!  The 3rd DVD from this season is scratched and won't play. I am frantically looking for the 3rd DVD so I am caught up before season 4 begins. To say I am upset is an understatement. I am glad I didn't pre-order 4.

B00F35BV64|1.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is an insult to Trekkies--the dialogue is insipid, the plot is predictable except when it is making no sense at all.  Drivel squared.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Super fun. It has bingo and slots combined. The bingo is great cause you play against live people and you can talk while you play. You get to earn collection pieces to earn more credits which makes it more fun. Best part is you can trade pieces with friends.
B001BANK32|5.0|Not much else I can add since there are so many reviews already here.<br /><br />I am a big King fan, but I've never read this book because I disliked the movie so much.  Jack Nicholson is so over-the-top cheesy and Shelly Duvall is like a beheaded chicken, it's unwatchable to me.<br /><br />Now that there's a sequel out I decided to give The Shining a try.<br /><br />It's exciting, scary, funny and really, really sad.  Watching a man completely unravel is heartbreaking.<br /><br />It's not in my top 5 King books (The Stand, It, Under the Dome, 11/22/63, Salem's Lot), but it definitely makes the top 10.
0205313426|5.0|Excellent resource book for all my classmates & those English majors to have. Easy to read & understand. Not one of those &#34;bulky&#34; heavy books but is jammed packed with information.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I loved this collection of short stories, they have a freshness and an honesty about them and are very modern tales with enough twists and turns to delight any reader of this genre. They are ideal for lovers of science fiction, technology and computers. There is an amalgamation of clear scientific knowledge and experience from the author and he produces a crisp, sharp, intriguing look at modern day and the near future. The stories are written with style, characterization is superb and the descriptive prose is effortless in its apparent simplicity; a notable talent and skill of the writer. If you enjoy the laws of physics being altered or where technology almost overtakes humanity and our semblance, regulated sense of the normality, I urge you to purchase this book. I am very impressed with not just the sincere style of the writing but also the sheer exuberance and energy of the stories, which literally jump off the page to enthral, amaze and ultimately entertain the readership.
0385743564|4.0|The plot was pretty good and kept the reader engaged in the story for the whole book.  There will be a sequel, and I'm looking forward to it (though it is a year away, sigh!)  If you have read Brandon Sanderson books before, you can recognize his style, but it's not just a rehash of the same storylines.  This is an original, fresh story and not like his other stories.<br /><br />The only downside really was the twists at the end, but one of them I had figured out in the prologue.  So it was kind of like just waiting for the characters to realize that particular plot twist for the whole book.  All the other twists were unexpected at the end, which was nice because there was one thing that happened toward the end that was a real downer, but was resolved in a way that didn't rely on magical plot twists meant to tie up loose ends that some authors use.
B00136JS12|5.0|my favorite band from that era! great quality download. love it! love it! love it! great sound. thank you much!
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|It's okay and I liked it but it's not the best so I guess I would give it a B ...and I think it's a B movie  I like the star though.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The writing style was decent but it got a little too far out there and ended up just being weird.  There were many grammar errors in this book.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|My wife and I were looking for the evenings entertainment and found this on Amazon...<br /><br />Great theme and terrific plot twists!<br /><br />Loved it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love playing it just before I go to work in the morning then when I get back its all ready to go again
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Maybe not loved it but it was interesting ans I liked it.  Tom Cruise delivered as usual and it was his type of movie.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|I don't know why I love this movie! It's great!<br /><br />Definitely a must see if you haven't seen it before.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As the levels get higher, it gets tougher to figure out what is going to work and what order to do them in!!
B008IGP8RI|4.0|Music straight from the video so if you like the movie you will like the CD.  Great mixture of bluegrass and mountain music.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|This is at times a terrifying book. It is an absorbing read, but it could do with editing in the second half. The author appears to know his subject very well indeed - most of what he writes rings frighteningly true, and yes, there are overtones of Orwell's writing in it. The first section is cleanly constructed and easily followed, but when the author challenges us more in the second section, changing his voice from protagonist to Greek chorus to 'other', it at times becomes difficult to follow. Perhaps this is intentional as the hero(?) finally loses any claim to individuality/family identity/truthfulness or honour. North Korea is supreme at all times, and The Great Leader demands total discipline from his followers and subjects.<br />A 'must read' for ideologues and political fanatics of all parties.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you have a TV without WiFi this a great product, easy to install even for a novice, ordering another one.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Such a good movie. This is a great family movie. I bought this for almost everyone I know. Love it!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really like being able to send from virtually any device but it seems to buffer a lot more than other wireless devices need to, I was thinking that maybe it is overheating but I am still not sure. Sometimes it just locks up and I have to pull it out and let it cool down for a bit. I leave it powered up and plugged in all of the time for the convenience and maybe that causes it to get hot, I'm not sure.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|The case seemed durable but after a couple of weeks of use the red cap broke off and the case would not stay closed.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I LOVE IT!!! WORKS WONDERS.  Easy for My 8yr old to function properly so her tablet isn't cluttered with open apps.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I used to get Pinterest on my kindle and the format was one picture at a time.. I would spend a great amount of time on this every day.<br />Now there are many small pictures on the kindle screen, and they take forever to come up, I am extremely unhappy with Pinterest..<br />I wish it was the way it used to be.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|These are the best pacifiers by far for new born/ infants... It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto for comfort...  We bought at least 10 of these on Amazon for our daughter and as gifts...  A+++++ product...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I rarely ever buy games. however, for this game I had to get it. if you like games that require a good amount of thought, then this is the game for you. quite realistic in many aspects, although some minor changes would be helpful and great; such as making animation on world map for deaths after countries have been infected. that is just my opinion though.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game for those that want a well spent dollar. there are in game purchases, but without those it makes the game that much more difficult.<br /><br />hope my review is helpful, don't think about it, just click that button and start downloading.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Got the sailor moon figure before its estimated time of release which is a major plus in my book, just as described in the description, beautifully crafted an looks just like the real character from the show! Very durable an easily movable, recommend this for the older generation, not for children under the age of 15 I would say. Worth the value of the price an can't wait for the rest an any new scouts to come out.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|The discs in my set all play music, but, where is the mini-documentary? It does not show up on the media playlist at all when inserted into the computer!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|WHEN I GOT THIS WATCH AND WEAR..<br /><br />IT IS TOTALLY COMFORTABLE AND LOOK FANCY<br /><br />IT COMPORTS WITH CASUAL AND SUIT EITHER.<br /><br />WE WILL LOVE IT!
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|I just wish it were longer, otherwise, this was an awesome book. If you have ever had a dog, you will totally identify with at least 90% of the content.
B0089AD8IO|3.0|I extremely enjoy the first 7 drs., but I don't care for the interior of the TARDIS in these new episodes so I haven't watched much to give a higher rating.  The morbid red of the interior does something to my problem with panic attacks.  I want a Bright TARDIS!
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a beautiful story!!  An amazing journey with beautiful characters.  I am so glad that this was the book I chose to read and wish there was more.
0439023491|1.0|There not cover for the book thats part of what i wanted so the set matches. Know what your getting isn't what you see
B00F6HOW4M|5.0|Amazing, amazing, AMAZING! Drake is the epitome of creativity and versatility... He never disappoints! Love him! He sets a new bar every time he goes in the studio.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an awesome book it is sci fi AWESOME MUST BUY<br />This book is the best book in the world (-:
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I just fell in love with the audio- everything from the sound effects to the music.  The video quality is definitely eye-catching, and looks great on every setting that i had adjusted my television to (I didn't try them all).  There is much about the story/plot that I would put up to debate; nonetheless it is definitely an artistic movie worth watching multiple times.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|Once again another app that only allows you to sign up with a Facebook account. Some people don't want to use Facebook! It seems that Facebook is slowly trying to insert itself in every thing we do app wise. I'm not sure why I can't just sign up the normal way. Well that was silly I do know the real reason of this &ldquo;free&quot; app.....to advertise to me and all of my Facebook friends, rarely do we get anything for free anymore without having to give something in return !!!! I uninstalled!
B006PTL1QM|4.0|As a big fan of all three actors and period pieces, I knew I'd like it right from the start. It's apparently historically accurate.
B006Y39LNY|4.0|This report is nothing short of fabulous!<br /><br />My main gripe is that it is not in widescreen format. I also find it pricey for just 13 minutes.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The best of the best of the angry birds games you will be so addicted to it that you will scream lol
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson doesn't write bad work. I wouldn't say this is my favorite book by him but it is still much more entertaining than most of the stuff I've read in the YA section. If you enjoy interesting characters, an engaging plot, and good storytelling then this is a great find.
B00632HWOG|5.0|love my yahoo easy access ,modern,up to date great graphics.give it a 5star rating.you can do anything give it a try
B004V9MU86|4.0|Good book to read though the ending can be readily predicted. the book could do with being about 20% shorter. Was worth reading though especially before going to see the movie that should be coming out later this year. unusually written from a 3rd person like perspective yet they seemed to have a persona.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a pretty cool game. I like how you can collect little tokens for the place you are and you get cool prizes every week if you collect all of them. The reason I gave this only four stars was because my subway surfers is very slow on getting the updates to the new places. It is not just my kindle fire, because my sister has a kindle fire, too, and she gets hers updated faster than mine. Oh well, at least I can still play it! So don't let that stop you I really recommend this game for all ages. GET THIS APP AND HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!<br />  : )  ; )!!!
B00915G6YE|3.0|I see that I am in the minority here.  But seriously.<br /><br />Dexter is my favorite TV show of all time.  They should have stopped after the 5th season.<br /><br />I understand they wanted him to evolve but it was just badly done.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I've been pretty obsessive over the books and the movies for about a decade which is basically half of the time I've been alive. I was excited about the show when I first heard about it and was amazed to find that it surpassed my expectations. The cinematography is beautiful and obviously all of the actors do a great job as well. I am so delighted with this show and I have never seen a cast so willing to spoil their fans with goodies. By that I mean the whole flower crown thing on twitter which I didn't care for at first but I really love how much Bryan Fuller wanted to please his fans.<br />This dvd/blu ray does have the gag reel, deleted scenes, etc. so you can expect to keep yourself busy until season 2 comes out. It's also a great price right now. So I would recommend buying it which would also help support this show go on. Hopefully they can finish until the end of the book series. You can expect to see me buying and reviewing the dvd/blu ray for each season if they keep it up!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is pretty fun. Not too bad of an app. A nice updated spin on the traditional UNO game that combines social media.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of the best free games you can get! This app is so fun and realistic, I love it! The graphics are very good to, for a free app.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I been waiting for this game and if it let us give it 1000 stars I would I totally love it the song is also very catchy
0307352153|1.0|Buyer Beware - This is a review about the poor quality of the book binding.  By chapter three, most of the first two chapters had come loose and fallen out of the book binding; floating like autumn leaves to rest under my chair.  Unfortunately, I had started reading the book after the 30 day return window.  So, note to self: next time I will flip through the book & test the binding as soon as I receive it or better yet, get it on Kindle.  One star to Broadway Paperbacks/Crown Publishing/Random House for cheap quality publishing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it!  Its great to know how much battery I have left so I don't have to quess how much time I have left.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have always loved this authors  books. She is an excellent story teller, and very comprehensive.  I look forward to reading others.
1400052181|4.0|I've only read a few chapters of this book, so maybe not the best one to judge, but to me it sounds excellent.  I don't feel that the synopsis of the book did it justice but then maybe they didn't want to give away of the total book.  I would recommend it for an interesting read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A fun read that I could not put down in my quest to be a better man in my day to day journey. We will connect.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|i cant wait for the whole collection... if you love the lord of the rings this is a must see
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Pretty standard Reacher saga, except that I was disappointed that he didn't get laid.  There were two obvious candidates, but I guess the author didn't think that we needed every Reacher novel to verify his male prowess
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Really. A great story . Now on to second part of the club .  Thanks Baldacci.  STONE cold next... b n
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Was a good challenge but not SO tough you can't figure it out. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles, can't wait for part two!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on the fifth floor, but I find it fun. I can see it becoming extremely challenging at the higher levels.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Awesome book.  It really captures the day to day struggles of the IT world.  It give a unique look into the misconceptions of IT and how businesses tend to neglect the importance of IT.  Win IT Wins, Everyone Wins.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is a great movie!! My boyfriend and I love it! it is a must see I laugh so hard everytime I watch it
B000OV85AW|5.0|This movie is well done its one of his best. It's one of the best. I'ts hard to believe the prison system is so harsh .
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I haven't been a huge Dream Theater fan since Images and Words (loved that album to pieces). I'm a 42 year old drummer and my favorite bands are Rush, Queensryche (through Empire), Iron Maiden, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Genesis, Yes, Ozzy, Metallica, etc. so you get idea of my tastes.<br /><br />I was looking forward to an album with Mangini's full involvement and this product does not disappoint. Many times an album doesn't grab you on the first listen but maybe grows on you (or doesn't). This one grabbed me on the first listen and I'm looking forward to listening over and over and maybe obsorbing some of the drumming for my own bag of tricks.<br /><br />All the musicianship, vocals, and song-writing are top notch and very consistent with the best of DT's style.<br /><br />If any of you were hoping for the return of Portnoy, don't hold your breath as I don't think that's going to happen (if there was any doubt before).
B009O2XY12|5.0|Great app .  Easy way to pass by time.  Had to get it to get the kik app from 4 shared .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a great time playing this game! Looking forward to added rooms in the future. This was a fun way to fill time between calls at work (I work in a call center).
B0002DB52M|5.0|Dogville requires one to use another part of the brain.  For some, closing your eyes, listening to the dialog like you listen to a narrator read a book to you, and imagine is a far better way to &#34;experience&#34; the movie.  A totally immersive piece that satisfies curiousity.  I selected this film because of the treatment of the prologue.  As an architect, I look for films that emphasize spatial<br />relationships and socio-cultural influences on design.  The prologue introduces the town and its characters as they relate to an architectural plan. It was intriguing and thought-provoking.  I was far from disappointed with the entire film in the same way.<br />kharis 7
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a good game to kill some time. It is fun for a short time but not very complex.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this book against my better judgement after being told repeatedly by a family member that it is a fantastic book.  I knew the book had received some negative reviews but thought I should find out for myself.  What I discovered was tedious and repetitious writing, unlikeable and ridiculous characters, and a subject matter (BDSM) which didn't even turn me on. I like books with a bit of slap and tickle, but not serious slapping until it really hurts.  Urgh!  Even if you're into BDSM there must be better written books out there than this rubbish.  Give it a miss.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It works great...Just wish the groove was a little deeper...It slips out to easy when you prop it up..Also would like two different settings of tilt degrees..
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I bought a book through the store but I am not able to download or access the book from the device - says not compatible.<br /><br />Shouldn't they have informed about it before buying it.<br /><br />And there has been no response my complaint yet !!!!!<br /><br />I did not expect this from Amazon !!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing the most wonderful book as easy of a read it was it will forever be considered one of my favorite books
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This film blew my socks off! It works for me on SO many levels: a Love story, Romeo and Juliet style, part Peter Pan, the Celebration of the individual, the cold, unfeeling adults and social system, and part &#34;Elvira Madigan&#34;, sans the Mozart. A Lovely, Inspiring film...
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Vey detailed. Very scary. Very unexpected. This movie felt so real and the zombies' looks so real. Also, Brad pitt did a great job especially the wife. She is a good actress
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Takes a lot is storage but still SUPER FUN!!!!!!!!! Very fun and good work God bless you ALL Have a good day or night and happy b day for a person out there again God bless you!!!!!!!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Like all of Connelly's books, it is well-written and compelling. I didn't enjoy Haller as a prosecutor as much as I like him as a defense attorney, but in did enjoy seeing him and Harry in the same book. These overlapping characters are a nice touch. I would recommend it for all Connelly fans.
B0000669JL|5.0|It's so nice to be able to revisit so many classic reggae tunes performed by the Master of the Genre. I can listen to this album over and over and over again and it is still always fresh...
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is great awesome sweet cool Would recommend to my grandmother. I love this game. I can't wait for the sequel sweet.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|EVERYONE should read this book ... Pam you present some important information in a casual but straight forward manor ... Thank you for BEING!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the first Zuzak novel I have read and it this is the standard indication of the man's ability to tell a story I will be reading everything he writes! I found the narrative fresh and beguiling -  the way the chapters and story were laid out were so intriguing. Most fiction leaves me wanting something more at the end of the book, or else has me picking at things as I'm reading - stilted dialogue or whatever - not this one. Truly, a most satisfying read. Loved it. From beginning to end.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|Well, Rod the Mod certainly dug deep into his earlier (and best) repertoire to fill this wonderful double CD. I especially like the alternate versions of old familiar tunes, as well as the outtakes included in this fine album. What a Winner!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I like happy ending stories as this one, at first I thought it's going to be a horrid story from some words like secret garden and one hundred rooms which nobody comes into.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I see why it sold as many copies as it did.  Compelling characters and a lively plot. Having read the book, I'm amazed at how much nuance, Brando was able to bring out, in playing the part in the movie.
0470913029|5.0|I am gluten intolerant, so this diet is perfect for me.  Also, I really need my healthy proteins and more fruit and veggies in my diet.  It just makes good sense!
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|I am a huge fan of the crow and it was a good cut of the film. The only problem was it did not include some scenes that was in the directors cut. Worth a watch and give it a shot.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Liked the way that Nesbo wove in aboringinal stories into the book. Made it a fun read. Did not see the end coming which is always fun too.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am seriously blown away by this free app. I love learning languages, this is free, and I've learned tons of Spanish so far. Once I get settled in, I plan on going back through the app to learn some German and Italian, as well. Booya, DuoLingo, booya.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|It was a good finish to a great series. I was disappointed for Jacob, didn't like his ending.  Wish it would have been a better ending for his story

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a totally different twist and keeps you reading to try to figure out where the  story is going.  Very difficult to put the book down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The game in my opinion is good for both experienced and those new to hidden object games the story also exceeded my expectations keep up the good work.
B00000JL86|1.0|This was a rip off, the CD skips like.... 30 times. I had to fast forward through the skips it was that bad.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What an amazingly wonderful story this is. I have tears in my eyes and a heart full of emotions as I type this.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I read this book after wanting to see the movie, but never getting around to it. I would recommend this to all moms of teenagers.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|IT,S good as it alows u to mark, read annoatate all at the same time and is pretty fast too
B00CFA222M|5.0|I loved this movie, I thought it was an excellent family movie. I would recommend it to all ages. Lots of funny and ooooy & goooooy parts.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game puts Angry Birds to a whole new level. It has so many new unused characteristics that I enjoy playing with. I recommend this app to either any Angry Birds fan or Star Wars fan.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I started playing this, was really enjoying it, then had to leave to run an errand. Now the game won't even load - it just shows a circle going around and around. I guess I wasted 99¢ and sure am glad it wasn't more expensive!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very impressive or successful. That's the way Merriam-Webster defines Brilliant.<br /><br />That is an understatement for this masterpiece. Sound City is one of those places that you've encountered for all, or at least a good chunk of your life and not even know it. Countless raising bands and artists got there start at this studio. I give props to Dave Grohl for bring this into the forefront of the musical annals.
B00F2362IE|5.0|My 4 year old plays this and he is better than I am.  A lot of fun and a good time burner.  5 stars
B00338QENI|5.0|As an African American this book should make all of us proud. It seem we as a race has contributed much more than we are given credit for. Hats off to the Lacks family for all they have contributed to the human race. This is the best book I have read on any subject.  I will recommend to any one interested in medical history and rights when it comes to medical research.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved it!  It made me laugh and cry.  So beautifully written in a twisty way!  I hated for it to end.
B008469DGY|4.0|What would bring this to 5 stars would be the addition of a putter to finish the hole. Since you've gunning against the clock anyway, this would give a sense of the possibility of completion to the game.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|This was the first Star Trek novel I have ever read.  Although I have seen all the movies and even the original and TNG tv episodes.<br /><br />Anyways... it is a good book and for 99c, a great deal!<br /><br />I struggled for the first half or so of the book where the author wrote in the first person.  I almost stopped reading a few times, but glad I kept going.<br /><br />The book had a great ending (and the story went into third person narrative).<br /><br />I bought the 2nd book (great) and am now reading the third one (again, great book).<br /><br />All these books seem to really focus on Data and his family of androids (and creator).
B003AVPV1O|4.0|Not much else to say other than that it works. It's tidy and surprisingly sturdy-feeling. The picture belies the 1ft cable length.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book so much. It was extremely enticing and full of twists and turns! I highly recommend this book.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|This book is an important work for our time.  Compelling, wrenching, unbelievable. Humbling. Thanks to Slavomir Rawicz for bearing witness, for his courage, perseverance and fortitude. Can't help but wonder what happened to the other survivors. I hope they found peace.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I downloaded this specifically to be able to play/display Flash.  Why Silk can't...?? arggg.<br /><br />Anyways.  It is better than Silk, but I was hoping for more.<br /><br />Still seems to have too much lag reformatting pages.  I find holding my Kindle Fire HD Vertically, the Dolphin Brower works better than when holding it horizontally.<br /><br />I can play flash videos now.  But with Silk playable videos would open up as a video-only.  With Dolphin you can zoom-in to see them full screen,but you are only zoomed in and ads may pop up or trying to move around the video slider usually moves the entire page.<br /><br />Better than Silk, but I'd still like a better browser for my Kindle Fire HD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book ever!! I really enjoyed all three books. Can't wait for the movie! Gone be awesome.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I played a few games and then it started acting goofy. I couldn't figure out what to do. It keep wanting me to buy and I wasn;t nterested
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Not my favorite album - I liked it better than Vapor Trails but not as much as Snakes and Arrows.  They are still doing the Rush &#34;thing&#34; and they do it well.  It's nothing earth shatteringly different, and it has grown on me the more I listen - especially now that I've seen them play it at a show.
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|The biggest disappointment is that the best song on the 16 track version \\"Angel\\" That I purchased is only an interlude WTF. My second complaint is that this is not the deluxe version.  This crap has got to stop, where the heck is the rest of my music?  If I pay for a full CD I want a full CD!<br />To be honest the rest of the songs on the CD are good but not as good as the old John Legend which is a compliment, the only worthy comparison is him in the past.  I know it is hard to be the old you and the new you at the same time still I wished that he would have pushed himself a little more lyrically to make the tracks a bit more uncomfortable.  There is nothing uncomfortable here.  The music is easy to digest both lyrically and musically.  I am not challenged therefore it is boring.  John remains one of the few artists out there I would still pay to go see however this contribution falls short on a lot of levels.<br /><br />+ Good music easy to listen to.<br />+ It is John Legend.<br />- Where is the rest of my music, I got to pay to get what should be on this CD?<br />- Where the heck is the rest of Angel, Only an interlude?<br />- Boring no challege, you can play this for mom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so exciting and hot!  I found myself refusing to put it down until all three books were completed!  I sure hope I can find another book as interesting to read as this one was!
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|One of those books where you have to read one more paragraph before you sleep. A wide range of interesting characters. In depth investigation.  A very clever writer is Mr Hayes
184767481X|5.0|Not as awesome as the YouTube videos, but it's a great way to support Simon's Cat, and I love having the drawings to look through whenever I want.
1451650728|5.0|My order arrived yesterday September 25,2013.  This book is in excellent condition.<br /><br />My new book will be added to my ever growing collection.<br /><br />Everyone who loves Star Trek The Next Generation novels should read this book.<br /><br />I plan to start on this novel very soon.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It has me on the Fringe of my seat, hahaha... I just simply Love it & Walter keeps me in stitches (joke)!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very violent but not like the movie. I can't wait for catching fire to come out in theater I hope it is worth the money.
B005ES0YEK|4.0|I am a huge fan of CROCS, I wore out my last pair and this one is the replacement.  I bought a women's 7 (Men's 5) and they still fit a little big - I wear a 8.5 normally in women's shoes.  I have always known that about CROCS, but I think maybe even a women's 6 would fit better.  Love the shoes, have not taken them off since I got them.  I would recommend these to anyone, even with the wierd sizing.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun and a really good fine motor skill . Fingers don't work great but this does. I have a pretty good time too
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Short and sweet. Very imaginative - I love the new magic system, as always. If only it could have been longer...
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I first downloaded this App when it came up as the free app of the day, and didn't think I'd use it too much. Then I discovered the variety of sounds available and liked it a little more. Then they added the mixer feature, and I've been hooked! I use it all the time. Great variety, and the mixing allows you to put together your own personal relaxation track. Also, the company is always adding new sounds that you can download and add. My favorite is a mix of \\"Car Rain\\", \\"Driving in Rain\\", and \\"Rainstorm\\". Sounds redundant, I know, but it makes me feel like I'm on a road trip and it's raining. For reasons even I don't understand, it relaxes me and helps me focus like nothing else can. I even turn it on at night when I can't seem to get to sleep any other way. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B002UD56I6|4.0|If you are a die hard fan then you have to buy it. If you aren't then this won't convert you.its a little sad to see how they had to put this together and it's definitely not one of his best, but interesting all the same.
B008M87GJK|5.0|It has all the information in all the categories of news.There is video in case you need extra news from correspondents.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|If you like a good thriller this is it. Action, suspense, and thrills are here, the only thing missing is an R-rating!!! This movie is basically a Zombie Movie on Ritalin!!! No gore no blood no sense of death or fear of dread. You just kind of wanted to see more violence but Mr. Pitt kept it politically correct. I would have given it more stars if it was a little more graphic. Don't get me wrong I liked it but this could have been 100x better with an adult rating. Why is Hollywood going soft!!!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I remember reading this book back in high school.  It's one of those experiences you never forget.  It touched my heart and certainly showed an incredible viewpoint.  I remember thinking how difficult the characters had it; not knowing how real it actually was for the times.  I recommended it to my brother Jim, and he reluctantly read it.  A week later he went on and on about how great it was( for some reason forgetting I had recommended he read it in the firstplace)<br />Hugh Jackman-playing a perfect Jean Valjean- was quite frankly stunning with extraordinary depth and fearlessness.  He tugs at the heart-strings with the horrible fear filled life he had to live.  His humanity shines thru brilliantly in every scene.<br />Russell Crowe was great behind the eyes-he sold it-but his voice was not as honest and booming as the other actors.  Even thou, his presence was strong and convincing.<br />Now Anne Hathaway( for how briefly she's in the movie) was absolutly incredible playing the factory worker turned prostitute Fantine.  The downward spiral of her character, was like a surge of fire from a gun barrel.  A passionate gut-wrenching portrayal of an  abysmal life.  One scene in particular where she sells her hair, then later her teeth, was a gripping depiction of how far we can fall. Anne deserved all the appropriate accolades she received.  Her singing voice was as beautiful and passionate as any you'll hear.  She got as bare and real as can be gotten; even dispersing her beauty for realism and art(something to see, even if only once)<br />The all familar ache of Jean Valjean doing the right thing; was just as agonizing as it was in the book, as well as in earlier movie versions.  The backdrop of the French revolution later in the film; has the inertia of a avalanche( even if you don't like musicals) racing towards the end.<br />I felt the setting and grimness were overpowering; the raw reality of a bygone and violent era were easily felt.  You'll find the supporting cast a bit off, but the direction makes up for it.  The score is as much a character in the movie as anyone-soaring over sorrow and loss-as it moves along the narrative.<br />It takes a bit to get used to the lack of very much dialog; especially if you saw the earlier movie,but the power of those melodies certainly makes up for it.  At 2 and a half hours the film made sense;however 3 hours certainly would have been pretentious and too ambitious.  It takes the grey pain of life: reasons it out in different landscapes, dishes out the fear of poverty convincingly and illuminates the reality of life's hard bargains with thyself.<br />I enjoyed this film immensely; and the summation of the performances were well worth it!  I recommend it highly!cast a bit off, but the direction makes up for it.

B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I loved the game but now the new update it keeps saying my Username and password don't match. I'm really getting pissed. fix please.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|The game is pretty good. It took me a while to find a good game and when this one showed up I downloaded it and assent board anymore.
B007IK44CK|4.0|In this high flying, action packed, secret agent movie, character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) preforms acrobatic stunts and one intense fight scene after another. This surprisingly well directed film is not only loaded with an insane amount of action, but is also deeply intricate and will require the audience to think. Brad Bird and the writers also did an astounding job by keeping this film interesting by adding many twists and turns. The only downfall is that the movie drags on a little and seems long at times.<br /><br />The main plot point, or \\"impossible mission\\", of the movie was that a disemboweled team of IMF agents had to clear their name by stopping Hendricks from launching a missile thus creating a nuclear war and \\"ending the world.\\" The mission pans out to be a long extensive one with twists and turns leading up to the big finale.<br /><br /> The surprising fact about the director, Brad Bird, is that this was his first real life action movie. Most of his early works that he was known for were all animated, such as; The Simpsons (1989), The Iron Giant (1999), The Incredibles (2004), and Ratatouille (2007). From the list of these works, you would not expect him to have been able to direct an action movie of this caliber.<br /><br />The movie's action kicks off with a bang in the second scene with Hunt escaping from a Russian prison, fighting all the inmates and guards to find his Russian intel man and get out. Hunt throws inmates from ledges and makes the guards look like fools with his acrobatic and superior fighting skills. From then on, it's one high-tech action scene after another. Like the \\"Gecko\\" gloves that allow agent Hunt to climb on the windows of the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world), which makes for a fantastic gut-wrenching scene.<br /><br />What makes this movie intricate and sometimes difficult to understand is all of the different characters and how they disguise themselves and pretend to be different people on and off again. Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), the crazy nuclear extremist, seems to be everywhere and is even disguised perfectly as his assistant during the biggest chase scene of the film.<br /><br />This is one thrilling, action packed movie that should appeal to a wide range of people. From the acting to the intricate storyline, this Mission: Impossible movie not only lives up to its predecessors, but may be the best one yet in this successful movie franchise. The series and this Mission: Impossible in particular are on a complete different level than any other action films to date and have almost created its own genre.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|The movie is wonderful!  Quirky, simplistic, feel-good.  Each character brings a unique perspective to Patrick's story and all assist in his success.
1481278738|3.0|I got this to make it easier to understand my go pro hero 3 .<br />I gives you some good information but could be more informative.
B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|I was very excited when I heard that KOL were going back toward their early sounds with Mechanical Bull.  And when I listened to the first three songs, I believed it!  Once the third track, Beautiful War came on, I started getting disappointed as the songs started getting slower.  My high hopes of the old school sound are completely gone.  With that said, I think it is their best since Because of the Times.  KOL at least sound like they are having fun again!<br />An improvement of the slower ballads on this record is that they keep it more interesting.  Beautiful War has a funky bass line and Wait For Me has interesting guitar sounds.  I feel like Coming Back Again is the only real throw away track.  It feels forced and sounds like a boring track off of OBTN or CAS.  The last song is nice and has a country vibe to it, but doesn't sound like it belongs with the other tracks.<br />Overall, it sounds like KOL are trying to please everyone with this record, but don't expand their sound or experiment at all.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so freaking awesome I can sit here for hours playing it till I die and then play again
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Finally, the creative days of \\"Madman Across The Water\\" are back! And that's all that needs to be said about this CD.  A long awaited welcomed addition to your Elton John collection.
