0316017922|5|This book had been recommended by a friend, and since I had read Gladwell's THE TIPPING POINT and liked it, I decided to give this a try.  It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come \\"out of the blue\\".  Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.    The most talked about part, in my circles of creative friends, is the 10,000 hours of preparation aspect.  Gladwell draws from several different success stories, of widely different professions, which show that it is not a fluke that 10,000 hours of practice and preparation go into making the masters of any field.  It is a challenge, laid out in very pragmatic terms, to anyone who wants to succeed at anything. In the back of my head, I kept hearing the old joke: \\"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?\\" \\"Practice, practice, practice.\\"  It's funny because it is seriously true.    Gladwell has a very comfortable style, making the book a pleasure to read.
B00B49L7Y4|4|Very watchable and moving. A story about a forgotten legend who was rediscovered. A unique true story about a humble man.
B007704HO6|5|Lovely heart warming true story of a man and his loyal cat.  Well written, story moves along nicely and easy to 'loose yourself in'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00HHE9H24|5|My first review of this short story was in 1964 or 1965 in high school. The teacher's comment about my review was merely a question. \\"Did you see the humor in the story?\\" To my total embarrassment, I had not. I was a  class clown, always telling jokes, but I did not get the humor. Why? Because I was living this every day. To me it was a story of my reality. All these years later, I can read it and enjoy it. It kind of has a Snoopy feel to it. Living in a fantasy world to allow you to do the things you cannot otherwise do.  A short read but a good one.
B00LDNE3FG|5|I love this game it not to easy and not to challenging and I'm glad it doesn't have any ads during the game because your constantly tapping unlike other games if you accidentally tap on an ad it would take you to the web then you got to start all over again
B000056NX5|5|I brought this d.v.d in October &amp; was so excited about it, because I have always loved the musical, &amp; liked the film Version with Ted Neely, so I guess I was expecting the same sort of thing. But *WoW* how wrong could I be, its so diffrent from the film version. From  the intro with the Guns &amp; &amp; the disciples all dressed leather. As you wacth  you think emmm very strange, but please dont be put off. because as soon as you hear the familar tune of &quot;heaven on their mind`s&quot;.  You forget about the guns etc. &amp; just get caught up with the whole thing, so much so i felt like I was one of the disciples singing along. Thats how it makes you fill like you go into the screen. All the parts were great Jerome Pradon was brillant as Judas with such a energectic performance I was quite overcome. But for me Glenn Carter was the icing on the cake, his whole performance was brillant, that when he sang Gethsemane it  made my hair stand up on the back of my neck, And he sang it so well as its quite a hard song to sing. To me Glenn was the Christ &amp; when you wacth it you go through all his emotion &amp; Anguish, &amp;  you felt the pain he was going through while being nailed to the cross. i love my d.v.d &amp; highly recommend it to anyone young &amp; old. The brillant Glenn Carter made this for me &amp; will go very far. We love ya Glenn.

B00DHKKN6Q|4|It's so much fun. I play when every I have the chance. It's so addicting and sometimes hard. So fun
B0036T1RMM|5|One of my favorite films.
1582701709|5|After seeing the book discussed on Oprah I was anxious to see what it was all about. The book is a quick read but it should not be read quickly. Take time to let each passage soak in. It is a life changing book.
B000MGBSI0|5|I had the series bootlegged from iffer.com but when I get my refund back at tax time I decided I wanted the whole series regular artwork DVDS, I gave the disk's away the fake one's loved the show, opening music, cast and characters!!!
B00E8B1P9M|1|I knew this would be the outcome, but I had to...I just had to! G.I. Joe was one of the first cartoons I watched in English back in the late 80s. Its funny, I think the cartoon had more depth, character, and better acting. This felt very much like the cartoon. The bad guys had really cool stuff, but they pretty much sucked everything. The story didn't flow, the acting was horrible (I think they paid old Brucie to be there), the &#34;badass action&#34; just got ever so uninteresting...<br /><br />If there was any redeeming quality, is the delightfully attractive Adrianne Palicki who's red dress appearance will stop many hearts for some time to come. But really...this movie is a terrible mistake. If you want to get your &#34;goo Joe!&#34; kicks, find a pair of destitute children, buy them two GI Joe-toys, and film them play. It will likely be more interesting, your film might actually have some emotional or intellectual depth, and you can enjoy some good karma fall-out.<br /><br />Garbage!
B006OCM0G0|5|this game is so so awesome. I love it. it teaches anyone to cook. my favorite recipe is the carrot cake.

0525953728|4|Thoroughly enjoyed learning about Mr. Owens' experiences. Being a staunch supporter of our military and unable to serve directly, the opportunity to see what our elite fighters do to maintain our freedom was very satisfying.
B00AF6MF9I|4|I highly rec this game. esp if you're a war buff like me. the graphics are fantastic and the game runs smooth
B0063IH60K|5|This is a great game! I enjoy playing it. Go ahead and download it, because it is totally worth it.
B0040JHXTI|5|What can we say but BRUUUUUCE!  This really lives up to it's promise and the remake of darkness was unbelievable!  I HIGHLY recommend it for any Boss collection!  RIP Clarence.
B001U9BRNE|5|Great concert, looking forward for the second one!<br />wasn't aware of how many artist worked with Mr Foster!<br />the list is incredible!!!
B008ETOSYI|5|I bought it not knowing much about it but im glad I did!  It was a great story. Will watch again.
B00884GR0W|1|Gangam Style on The Load Screen Is Tacky And Unprofessional. Instant One Star. Could Be AN Awesome Game, The Game Plays Well BuT Has Too Much Lag. FiX That And It Will Be Much Easier To Get A Good Review
B00RY95OFG|5|Very good Album
B001UV4XJ2|1|Beware the \\"digital copy\\" is not a downloadable copy of your own, but a link to a website IF you sign up and share email and personal information.  Based on the site reviews it looks like the \\"digital copy\\" can not be accessed without internet access.  I passed on signing up and will look for and AVOID the Ultraviolet scam on any future movie purchases.  Too bad I did not discover what the UltraViolet \\"digital copy\\" was until after I opened the package and thus can no longer return.    I got ripped off.  BEWARE  BEWARE  BEWARE
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Absolutely enjoyed the series, so good I purchased it!! I would highly recommend in fact I had my friend to watch it.
B007PTJOV0|5|this is a really great app.  sort of like having Mario brothers on the go and who does not love Mario brothers?
6303823351|4|Released only a year after the critically acclaimed \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" this film has a subtle edge to it, which in hindsight is quite poignant.<br />Yes, the boys are gorgeous, so young, so talented, so sexy--and in COLOR this time. The music, as it always was with the Beatles, was innovative for its time, often brilliant. The very silly plot, in which some bad guys want to steal a sacred ring from Ringo's finger, is fun and ridiculous and infectious. But it only takes a close listen to John Lennon's title song, \\"Help,\\" to know that he was already in distress.<br />The demands on the Fab Four were getting more and more troubling to each of them. Just on the horizon, if not already begun, was time with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, heavy use of LSD, the John and Yoko saga, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heartclub Band, and all that was to come until the inevitable acrimonious disintegration of the group.<br />Viewed in hindsight, therefore, \\"Help\\" makes this reviewer sad. It is so seemingly happy and innocent, so \\"60s,\\" and yet the viewer knows that it all fell apart. I think for those who did not experience the Beatles firsthand, however, this movie has to be a thoroughly enjoyable and wonderful experience. And for the rest of us, it's a trip down memory lane to a time when all things still seemed possible.
B0053F042G|5|I am so moved by this movie. People see it and ponder all that it offers. A real blessed offering to America.
B00PTB7B34|1|Requires WiFi. .. not just data connection but only WiFi. My WiFi at home is about as bad as it gets because I live in BFE. So I can't play because 4GLTE isn't good enough for Activision. Oh well. Looked fun. I can't even exit the game without killing the app through a task killer
B000ANVPPQ|5|Nice extra features on this collectors edition. I wish John Wayne and Chill Wills had done more movies together. Great movie and great DVD!
B00WCLEF06|1|Very thin story line. Little character development. Predictable plot.
B00EEPFLHE|5|If you have not purchased this CD as a Stryper fan, get on the ball now!!! if you have not purchased this CD as a non Stryper fan, become one and get on the ball now!!!! The absolute best Stryper comeback recording since they reformed in 2000, and is true to their sound in all aspects! It really sounds like the band again, and their previous reunion works were good too, but this.......this is the reigning champion of what we all fan have been waiting for, and they have not sounded this good, and true since \\"Soldiers\\". Michael hits a TON of high notes, and has lots of screaming, Roberts drums are real, live, and loud, and Tim's bass thumping can actually be heard more in the mix now, and the solo's are typical Stryper awesomeness!!! This is the direction they need to keep going in, and I dig the heavier, darker sound on this disc. i have no idea what my fave track is, but \\"Marching Into Battle\\" kicks my butt, and i seem to play that one more, and crank it up because of the beat, and Michaels high screaming - it really makes you want to march into battle!!!! \\"Saved By Love\\" is a fast heavy rocker that gets you pumped up, and wanna stage dive all over the place. \\"The One\\" sounds a lot like Michaels solo recording \\"Blue Bleeds Through\\" with the chrous, but that is not a bad thing, as that song was hauntingly beautiful, and \\"The One\\" is no different, and is the only slow track on the disc, although it is not a syrupy ballad. I love how live/raw the drums sound on this CD. I pray they never go back to the over-compressed, highly over-produced sound of IGWT, because as great as that CD was, it was way too sweet and sugary/polished sounding. The raw, darker, heavier sound on this recording is what they need to stay focused on, and give the fans what they crave, as well as edify their souls for making a killer record that will please the fans hand over fist.<br /><br />KUDOS Mike, Oz, Tim, Robert - this CD kicks *SS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />*UPDATE11/13/13* STILL loving this cd, and the songs are stuck in my head like tar on a white sheet! Again - if you are a Stryper fan, YOU MUST ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION!! If you are a metal fan who appreciates all formats of the genre, ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION! I swear i am going to burn out my battery of my MP3 player, and wear a groove in my cd from listening to this recording so much!!!! LOOOOOOVE IT!!
B009G7ZYPY|5|Susan Boyle can really sing and does a beautiful job on all of these well known songs on this cd. I have been playing it constantly since I got it and ordered four more as gifts for friends who love it as much as I do.
B001ANSS5K|5|Usually don't like books like this. The combination of a mystery and a love story completely got me hooked. Definitely would recommend it.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Great!
B00GFRA9AS|1|I was intrigued after reading the reviews and was very much looking forward to trying this out.  I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with PLENTY of memory available. To that end, the App downloaded very quickly and I was able to open it, create a profile and that was it. The next page that showed an i with a circle around it just stayed there. No matter what I clicked on, it stayed totally unresponsive. I tried getting out of it and back in and still the same. I would LOVE to actually play and review with 5 stars!!  Please, to the Developers, can you look into this?  Thank you!  P.S.  I have never had any problems with any other games on this Kindle or my 7&quot; one.
B00003CXRP|2|Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks. <br />This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning. <br />The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.<br />Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.
B00A757EFW|5|The major difference this Pac Man has compared to any other is the virtual versions is the virtual joy stick. It is by far the most accurate that I have ever played with. It makes this game very close to playing on A solid device.
B002LFPAUC|5|This is a favorite for my husband and daughter ... great to have it available on DVD to replace the old VHS set.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I thought that I knew where the plot was going but it took an unexpected turn!  I really enjoyed this read!
B00DPM7TIG|3|I just could not get into this book. Too much information to get to the end of the story which was disappointing. I'm not sure why this is considered such a compelling book. It isn't that the writing isn't excellent, the story just went on and on and on. I wasn't sure where it was leading even though I knew it had to be to connect the two main characters. They spent less than a day together, I think. Would not recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5|The setting of the game is very good and I really like the music of the game. Can't stop playing it every day.
B0063IH60K|3|I really like this app but I'm getting tired of winning every single game. Some people might like it but I would prefer a better challenge.
0486407217|5|very great and fast shipping A++++ Thank you so much!!
B004XUMMFE|5|One of the best Western/Science Fiction series ever done.  The genius behind it was never recognized until he started directing the Marvel movies.  I don't know what the network was thinking when they cancelled this tv series.  They could have had a runaway hit for several seasons if they had just given it a chance.  Oh well, their loss.  Just enjoy what was created and watch season 1. If you are a science fiction fan, you will be glad you did.
B003O86FMW|5|The best thing I've read in months. Great book, better than Hunger Games.<br /> Two thumbs up, read it if you haven't .
B0067Q42BY|5|very fun, excellent game I'm very impressed with the quality of this app.  finally amazons faotd is a good one!
B000002UYZ|4|I would definitely recommend this set (along with the follow up: \\"1967-1970\\" set) for the casual fan who wants a nice collection of Beatles hits, without having to buy all of the original studio albums.  I never used to like the Beatles.  But, having entered my 30s, I have grown quite fond of their music.  There is no denying the fact that they were musical geniuses and have had a tremendous impact on several generations.  My only complaint is that the record company \\"milked\\" the consumer by spreading 60 minutes of material over 2 CDs and charged over $30 for it.  However, when you take a look at the quality of material here and the impact the Beatles have had on pop music and culture, it almost seems like a fair price.
0739382365|3|This was a good story.  An unusual twist to what would happen if you lost your memory, and weren't too happy to get it back.
B0055SWM08|5|I loved this game and for once the ratings justify the true worth of an app/game. simple, elwgent and very addictive
B0060QM0AG|5|I just love James Herriot and can read these over and over.
B0073LWEXK|5|Fun game!  Nice graphics with many puzzles to solve.  I wish it could have been longer but overall a good game.
B005WUHAX8|4|Everything That I order was what I expected. Got it on time. Love the product. No problems with the order
B00Y6QF0PE|4|It was good. Just wish they had other parts like  Fifty Shades.
0380796090|5|I read this book for the first time about two years ago, when I was 19, and although the intended audience is about ten years older than that, I related to so much of this book.  My favorite part is a tie between two scenarios I will describe briefly so I don't ruin anything: <br />1.) When Claire, the main character, describes what happens when a young woman is forced to spend the night with a young man--not out of choice, but because she has no way of getting home.<br />[The scenario Claire descibes is so TRUE that when it happens in real life, my best friend and I call it a &quot;Watermelon night&quot; after the title] <br />2.) When Claire describes what happens when a couple in love breaks up and remains &quot;friends&quot;.<br />My only 2 complaints with this book are that the reader never gets a clear reason as to why James (Claire's husband)leaves her, and other things he does later in the story that I don't want to ruin, and that, as another reviewer put it, Adam's role in the story is a little too convenient and too good to be true.<br />Rachel's Holiday is also very good, although much, MUCH heavier, and I love how Claire is brought into the story (as Rachel's oldest sister), especially a very humorous moment when Rachel and her friend, Brigit, meet some fellow native-Irish boys in a New York bar.
B00B7FOQCK|4|Nice unit.  Good price. Fits my needs perfectly. Would otherwise recomend purchasing a powered hub... But that's more than I needed. Have an issue with family swapping out multiple cords with only one working USB slot.
B0094LV1D6|5|Funny action packed sci fi.
B00KK0PICK|5|great book. .. truly inspiring and lots of good tips.she has a different way of looking at clutter and the process of tidying up keep what you love she says. -
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I had not read a Grisham novel for a while and really enjoyed this one, I will have to read some more of his now.
B00863CMZE|5|I have always gone to their concerts in the US around the north Carolina area. This album gave me my &#34;fix&#34; until they find time to return.
B0065GC0BA|5|I had to wait several days after finishing this book, to be able to sit down and write my thoughts about it, and to think clearly to properly review this wonderful, wonderful story.  Such a powerful and extraordinarily beautiful story.  And next to the  epic love story of Alexander and Tatiana in The Bronze Horseman trilogy, it is the most profound and heart wrenching love story I have ever read.  JoJo Moyes is a brave lady to tackle a subject such as this, but she did it with such grace and compassion and joy.<br />At first, I didn't think I could write about this story,  It was excruciatingly painful to read the last chapter and last few pages and I was so angry with Will.  Yet the end was beautiful and full of love at the same time.  After a few days, I realized it had to end this way and JoJo Moyes did an extraordinary justice to the story.  Oh my.  It had to be hard for her, as well.  In the end, this story will make you think, will make you appreciate and love life even more, and will inspire you to be a better and more compassionate  person.  It's not all about you.<br />Read this..................you won't forget it.  And then read her first book, The Last Letter from your Lover.  It too, is a wonderful read.  She knows how to write a love story and she knows how it will touch you.
B0040I09RM|5|Watching SOA allows me to watch at my speed. Cuts out all the comercials and able to go back where I left off if I didn't fully complete watching a series.
B0002EXH5O|5|This is most musical megadeth album w/ even more solos and fast riffs. This is music in general is unbelievable. Mustaine and Friedmen steal the show w/ Nick Menza who is an unbelievable drummer. Its not as thrash as PSBWB or KIMB but its a different sound but possibly the best sound of megadeth Just pick it up  <br />you wont be dissapointed  <br />best songs= Holy wars hangar 18 take no prisoners and more <br />
B00HY7VU60|5|Great show.
B00ABKGG0C|4|Convoluted and sometimes difficult to follow, but all in all a really good read!
B0069G5Z9K|5|My 7yr old nephew and I love this game!  We like to see who can get the longest distance and collect coins for new jet packs.  I recommend this to boys 5+  and to anyone who likes going the distance for some coins :)
B00C04H2VO|3|I stick the bases on the instrument board in the car and put the toys on the bases. They will drop off as the car move around.

B00BEZTMFY|5|my son loves it!
B004DI7HZ6|1|A) If you've read Twilight, you've already read this book (with a few alterations I guess to stop people from claiming plagiarism). Although her name is Diana, I assure you--her real name is Bella. (And Matthew's real name is Edward).<br /><br />B) Lol @ Diana having every conceivable power a witch can have--even after we're told how 'rare' they all are. It's even more amazing how ridiculously they all come out. Overkill.<br /><br />C) Matthew must've run in some serious circles. No matter how a great a person, it makes no sense he would know every great person in every age. Overkill.<br /><br />D) I'm good w/a good witch or vampire story -- but then we had to add in greek (or roman) goddesses, time-travel and knights? Knights, Really? Overkill.<br /><br />E) There are so many rip-off scenes I can't believe it got published: From \\"(D) Please let me watch you hunt! (M) No, you mustn't, I am too dangerous then!\\".... to the \\"(D) I want us to be [ahem] together. (M) Not yet, we have plenty of time\\" to the (yawn) idea of a creature governing body (Volturi, anyone?) getting in the way of the mixed breeds love, and (duh!) the potential of the mixed-breeds offspring.<br /><br />F) Was there no editor here? Hundreds of pages of nothing... there were maybe 3 scenes that had action. The rest? Her sleeping in his arms, pining over their love, and them fiercely protecting each other (when? Why, during those THREE scenes of course!)<br /><br />G) And btw folks, after you've suffered through the boredom... guess what? There is no resolution! There are a million ways to leave a story ready for its sequel. Not resolving ANY story arcs should not be one of them.<br /><br />None. Nada. Zip.<br /><br />The sad thing is, I think she had a good start, and a overdone, but not-so-bad idea. Someone should've stopped the publishing until she a)cleaned it up and b)concluded the story.<br /><br />Waste of money. Waste of time.<br /><br />If I could rate it ZERO stars I would--just for the factthat everyone who paid money for this didn't even get an END.
0783225903|5|Timeless amazing film which gives new insights every time I see it. Great performances throughout, and a brilliant cameo by DeNiro.
0793518326|5|This book is so great!  It's everything that a Beatle's fan ( that happens to be a musician ) needs!  With this book, you can play anything by the fab-four as they played it...from Love me Do to Get Back!  It's more than  just a book...it's life!  If there is a God...it is within this book!  5  stars doesn't cut it...it deserves 100 stars!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Definitely a great game for anyone who is a fan of games like Temple Run. Guaranteed to get rid of boredom.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This book jumps through time, space, and perspective, but the reader is never lost or confused.  I thought it was captivating.
B00KNWYDU8|5|It is really creative
B0094M2OPY|5|This title gets 5 stars because its a great movie! Sound and picture quality are top notch! Would recommend to anyone
B004J4WNL2|5|This is the first time I have read so much about me from a person whom I've never met.  I have been found out.  Mysteries revealed through various test from different people is comforting to me.  Relieved am I as I read along.  Now I am interested in reading about extroverts.  God did create us all different for a reason.
B004XVMCMQ|5|This is my second favorite Jane Austen movie adaptation, next to Sense and Sensibility. When trying to figure out why (it's taken some critical hits because it isn't exactly like the book, and the director inserts some Jane Austen biography and [anti-slavery] politics into it), I've decided it's because of the superb casting. The actors bring the material to life in just the right way. Love, love, love.
B00FCQQ1IW|4|I loved this book, just as I had loved the previous 3. The only problem is that it finishes at a point that I really NEED to know what happens next, but book 5 will only come out next January...<br />I read these 4 books in the last month and a half, so I could finish one and immediately start the next. But now I'll have to wait months before I can get the next one...
B006H06IJO|5|COOL NICE ITEM
B001GUXJQA|3|I am trying to like Michael Connelly's books.  I have a friend who is nose deep into them and continues to rave about them so I am having a go at it.  They are readable and if you like detective type, macho man detectives with implausible twists, I think you will like this.  My friend who is crazy for them is male, middle-aged, very intelligent, energetic, and enthusiastic.  The Connelly books are like candy to him and he tears through them like a house a'fire.  Don't get me wrong; they are not bad.  They are just not my taste but they are well written.
B009ZW9DU2|5|A beautiful heart warming story about real life struggles concerning the plight of UK domestic cats and the human condition! James you should be proud of yourself. Bet your Mum is!<br />Come stay with us if you're ever in Auckland.<br />Dave n Yoshiko.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Melding together something very scientifically accurate with a well written story line isn't easy. This book does both amazingly well.....
B009FZFONO|3|I love the Walking Dead & the 3rd season has been fantastic after the second one dragged. But I'm dinging it two stars because Amazon's streaming has sometimes been patchy, & they still, after all this time, do not provide closed captions.
B008Y2FRFO|5|Very very fun game.  I have to admit it not as good as the paid coin games but for a free one its epic.
B007FIY3VW|1|I purchased this app hoping it would have more features than the free app I had downloaded. Unfortunately I should have just stuck with the free app. This app has less features and functionality.
B00005V3Z4|5|I'm not sure why some people are saying the Director's Cut is not worth getting, or watching. I've watched both and I believe the Director's cut is superior. How can it not be if it is what the director wanted? Not only is the insertion of the songs the way they were originally intended important (and one of the things I love about Donnie Darko is its attention to details), you also have the title pages (from The Philosophy of Time Travel) displayed in the Directors Cut. In addition there are key lines (such as Donnie's therapist's telling him he is an agnostic) and visuals(particulary toward the end in the montage) that can totally change the perception of the film.     I picked up a copy of Clockwork Orange recently and was suprised to learn that Burgess's original text released everywhere else (besides the United States) had 21 chapters. In a brilliant intro to the re-released Clockwork Orange, Burgess states that each work created has a duration and a reason for its particular order and that editing it alters the perception of it (he states this edited version in the U.S. also effected Stanley Kubrick's retelling in the film version). In short,the story should be available the way the author,filmaker, or artist intended it to be told or you alter the meaning. In relation to Donnie Darko, placement and pacing are crucial to the interpretation of this film, to alter it is to alter what the director/writer was attempting to convey. Get the Director's Cut.

1476751447|3|Lying, pure evil harpy.  PERIOD.  This woman belongs in prison at best. Everything she does is criminal. She even emptied out the WH when her and slick finally gave it up. Secret Service had to get it back, and of course they tried to \\"keep it quiet\\".  She claims they were broke when they left? Pullleez. This woman is a true criminal.  One of America's greatest enemies.  Please America Don't keep swallowing the lies. Do not contribute any money by buying this \\"book\\" of complete lies.  The woman has stolen enough from the American people.
B007J4T2G8|5|There is no stopping  point in this book! You just keep reading, wondering what's going to happen next! Must read!

B004SBX112|1|Never getting ad free games again. This was a total ripoff and just took all the non-angry birds ads out. Havnt  even seen the full page sds ive been doing this for such a short time. Barely works and doesnt do what i want it to do. Does anybody know how to get money back?
B000RZIGVS|3|The product itself is fine.  The discs work and they contain what they should. The packaging they come in however, couldn't be more cheap.  The discs are stored in a flimsy green plastic, open faced cases that hold two discs each.  The cases are are then stacked and taped together, the tape being the only thing that keeps the discs together as a set.  Plus the clips that hold the discs to the cases are difficult to get the discs out of and more often than not just break off leaving you with no way to keep the discs in the case.  My recommendation is do not pay retail price for this set and purchase your own cases to store the discs in.
B000JMKQX0|5|I really am enjoying this book and am anxious to see the movie based on it,despite the fact the movie differs considerably from the novel(or so I've heard!).The books style works for me-the separate interviews keep the story fresh and allow the author to tell the story from multiple perspectives.It is honestly the first book in years I've had trouble putting down...I have to add I am only half way through,but I have no reason to believe I will like it any less!
B00LXLM05I|5|Lot of fun much hours burned lol
0307271080|5|Other reviewers have commented on the story, the characters, and the focus on race in the novel, but for me the most compelling element in the book is Adichie's sensitive, ironic, sophisticated dissection of the immigration/migration experience. She writes with humor and a great depth of understanding of the clash between the dream of new beginnings and the joys and disillusionments of actual, voluntary emigration. She understands both the magnetic, irresistible force of the attraction to the Center that is engendered by growing up on the periphery of the old empires, and contrasts it unsentimentally with the multi-layered realities that have to be dealt with when the dreamers confront the often harsh realities of displacement and loss in the new world. Adichie's characters are products of a newly affluent Africa who are looking for personal enrichment and fulfillment, a far cry from the stereotype of the immigrant as an economic or political refugee, a person displaced by vast historical processes. A fresh treatment of old themes, this novel should be read by everyone interested in the current debates about immigration and multi-culturalism in America and the UK.
B00BMR5HOO|5|I don't have to wait for weather on tv,just have to touch my sunshine,there it is every time. So far it's been right in the money. Love it.
B000006V5H|5|Highly recommend this cd...<br />Great selection of songs from a very talented singer...For all fans of John Farnham I recommend this cd.
1582701709|5|I read the book after watching the DVD, and quite frankly, if I had to make a choice between the two, I'd choose the book.  (although I loved the DVD as well)  The book is a wonderful reference tool and great reminder as to how to live your life.  I've *known* the secret for a long time, but had never put a name to it.  I've experienced what happens in my life when I live it negatively, vs. positively, and there's a HUGE difference.  The trick with *The Secret* is, it's more than just *thinking* positive thoughts.  It's BELIEVING them!  I love how it explains about your *feelings* cuz if you're feeling crappy, than of course you're thinking crappy too, and then it snowballs.  So... Ya gotta learn how to control your *feelings*, and one of the things it suggests is to make up your mind each morning, before you get out of bed, that you're going to have a good day. If you BELIEVE that, you will.  I'm buying this book for my kids and all my friends.  THey may not be ready for it right now, but when they are, they'll have the resource they need to change their lives.
0345495004|1|I feel ripped off by this nonsense. I've studied FLW & his architecture. I looked forward to reading this.  They were both fascinating people but this was handled like a dime novel. What a disappointment. Total Drivel & a pathetic waste of time!
0738727326|5|This is definitely one of the most beautiful tarot decks I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend it. However, it may be a good idea to buy the set that comes with the paperback and (so I've heard) a more durable box. My only two complaints are that I've only had this for a week and only took it out of the box (and put it back in) maybe six times and the corners of the box are already dying on me. My other complaint is that the little booklet that comes with the cards doesn't fully explain most of them, probably so that you buy the book.<br /><br />The booklet does have instructions for the beginner on three spreads, which I enjoyed very much since I'd never seen any of them. Once again, there are faults with this item, but it's definitely worth the money. The cards are what really matter anyway, right?
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book... wow I couldn't put it down not even for a minute. after reading the second and then this one I couldn't believe all of what happened, it got to a point where I was like \\"I can't read this anymore\\" or I actually started crying in a couple places. This book was very emotional for me. But overall very good.
B004WR125O|4|has good range the only con about this product is sometimes it will hiccup and disconnect but most likely its the network great product.
B002SJKWZ4|4|Great Fun to use, once you master the moves and spells. It's a little complicated at times until you remember what each move represents.
B001RNO78U|5|These shoes were a great find.  Only thing I will wear in the winter - keep feet warm and very comfortable.  Much better than boots.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is awesome, fun & addictive. My daughter and I can hardley put it down. So far I don't have any cons to report.
B000H0MKGK|5|This is John Mayers best studio album, and its one of my all time favorite albums. The only song on here that I actually dislike is I'm gonna find another you which is at the end. My favorite song on the album is slow dancing in a burning room; this song has Mayers best hook. Some of my other favorites include dreaming with a broken heart, heart of life, belief, and stop this train. Waiting on the world to change is so overrated, but its a still a good song. Its just not better than some of the others song I've mentioned.
B00AIUUXHC|5|This game is so awesome. Its so addictive but in a good way. I think everyone should get this game. It is so fun to play and you get to upgrade ur shark. You start off with a shark with a baby shark and then u upgrade every time. Little spoiler alert the mystery shark after the Great White Shark can eat ANYTHING. Hes the biggest baddest shark. THIS MAY BE LONG BUT IM TELLING U THIS GAME IS AWESOME.
0062197258|4|Catherine is a party girl who enjoys the single lifestyle. When she meets Lee, she is immediately attracted to him and they strike up a relationship. Lee seems wonderful and her friends are all envious of their relationship. But gradually, Catherine starts to find the relationship claustrophobic. Lee starts questioning her about her movements, spying on her, trying to control her. We know from the book's prologue that things are going to go very wrong, but it's not clear exactly how it's going to happen.<br /><br />Meanwhile in a parallel storyline, we are also following a vastly different Catherine some four years down the track - one who is crippled by anxiety and OCD, finds it impossible to open up to anyone and who has clearly been through a horrific experience. A new man has come into her life, but can she trust him? And is she safe from Lee?<br /><br />What's great about this book is the rising tension throughout. There are some small twists and surprises along the way, but overall it's evident that we are building towards some kind of climax - it's just not sure what that will be. The suspense grew so strong that I literally couldn't put it down for the final 100 pages. Up until that point though, I did feel that it was a little too drawn out. Having said that, I liked the way the gradual shifts in Lee and Catherine's relationship - and her gradual recovery in the later story - were portrayed.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this, I strongly recommend [[ASIN:1408809133 The Bed I Made]], another (equally tense) book about a relationship gone sour.
3795753384|5|Great music one of my favorites of all time! good condition!<br />great choral music! fast delivery! one of the greatest choral pieces!
068484267X|5|Angelas Ashes is a fantastic book.  It shows us just how good we have it.  It is a great memoir both funny and forgiving.  Frank McCourt is stunning and will leave an impression on every readers mind.<br />It's about a boy living in poverty that has a drunken father and a begging mother.  He has  an abusive teacher and abusive relatives.  He lives in an ally where  everybody throws their wastes to the streets,and smells rank all the time.   To read this book you have to understand it from the beginning to the end.   I would recomend this book to ages 15and up, because it was hard for me to  read and understand and i am only 14.
B001BKAEHW|5|John Mayer is amazing!  His voice is so smooth!  A frequent to listen to!  Wonderful music!

0803723865|4|After taking Britain by storm and becoming one of the most popular picture books to hit it big in merry old England, America finally got a chance to read &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; in 1999. And, to be honest, it didn't make that big of a splash. It's a nice story, no question. There's a good basic plot and amusing illustrations by the talented Axel Scheffler. It's just a nice book, no more, no less. If you're looking for a picture book fable that adapts old variations of ancient folktales, methinks &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; might be exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br /> One day a carefree little mouse takes a jaunty stroll through the big woods. While doing so he comes across a sly fox that wishes to invite the mouse to lunch (wink wink). The mouse is no fool and makes his apologies, saying that he wishes he could but he's already meeting a gruffalo. The fox is unfamiliar with what a gruffalo exactly is, so the mousie comes up with an extravagant and horrific monster. This description is so effective that the fox speeds away. Next, the mouse meets a hungry owl and the same scene occurs only with slightly new gruffalo descriptors. After the owl makes his excuses and flees the mouse meets a snake and the whole process begins again. Once the snake slithers out of slight the mouse (who up to this point had no idea that gruffalos actually existed) comes across an honest-to-goodness gruffalo. The gruffalo is delighted to see the mouse (quote unquote, &quot;My favorite food!&quot;) and the small rodent must come up with a way to escape this new hitherto unthought of danger.<br /><br /> The story reminded me of the old fable about the boy and the giant. You've probably heard it at one point or another. In the story the boy convinces the giant (though delicate trickery) that he, not the giant, is the strongest creature on earth. This story is very similar to that idea, with the mouse convincing the gruffalo that he is the reason the fox, owl, and snake run away when the two of them approach. The text is definitely bouncy and fun and the whole book is written in rhyme. There's not a single line of text in this puppy that doesn't scan either, so the book's a fabulous read-aloud. It's great reading the smug mouse's, &quot;Silly old Fox! Does he know? There's no such thing as a gruffalo!&quot; Author Julia Donaldson (who also wrote the fabulous you-must-check-it-out &quot;Spiffiest Giant in Town&quot;) mentions in her author bio that originally she envisioned this story with a tiger. But it's hard to come up with many rhymes for tiger (Geiger?) so she changed her mind and invented the gruffalo instead. It's a far superior choice. Rounding out the story are Mr. Scheffler's great great illustrations. The small mouse protagonist never looks particularly scared by the dangerous situations he finds himself in. I also have a soft spot in my heart for any picture book character that regularly stands about with his arms crossed behind his back oh-so-casually. But that's just me.<br /><br /> A fine bit of storytelling with lovely illustrations and an enjoyable plot. I doubt very much you'll ever find anyone who dislikes &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely unlikely. If you'd like a fun story to read aloud to one, two, or twenty youngsters, this might be an excellent choice. Consider it definitely recommended.en the two of them approach. The text is definitely bouncy and fun and the whole book is written in rhyme.

B00BTYP6QE|5|Fun game. Challenging!  Thanks!
B002ZG99TA|4|Any story that revolves around the issue of a runaway train definitely makes for one of those ever-so-predictable cycles where you have the rapidly-rising tension in a race against time, the climax where the worst is over and finally the point at which the heroes are praised. I will agree that this movie is far from the best of its kind, but considering the incredibly low standards of a number of action/adventure films nowadays, I would have to say that this is definitely a standout gem for the times.<br /><br />We have a runaway train that is described as &#34;a missile the size of the Chrysler Building&#34; that is carrying tons of toxic chemicals that would prove catastrophic if the train goes over a curve adjacent to a bridge at too high of a speed, and it must be stopped. After a front-end intercept by a pair of locomotives leaves a veteran engineer dead, and a de-railing device proves to be a miserable failure, it is up to two men, a rookie and an experienced professional, to bring this speeding metal giant to a halt. After much of a struggle, the pair finally succeed in their mission, and the monstrous train is brought to its knees.<br /><br />In a general sense, despite what some critics might like to say to bash the &#34;predictability&#34; and &#34;unoriginality&#34; of the plot and outcome of this movie, I think that anyone who likes dramatic adventure films can really enjoy it for what it is. I definitely give it a solid recommendation for action/adventure movie lovers to add it to their collection.
B008Q0DAXK|5|One of my all-time favorite movies.
B00GT67UUM|5|Great game....really makes you think...good graphics<br />Getting it for free makes it even sweeter<br />I will be going back daily to Amazon to see what is next!
B00BWBHIUG|4|I haven't played the game yet but when I was looking at this I saw the number and I am very superstitious and I had to get it to a different number.
B003YL4KS0|5|My hair is so much healthier after reading this book, I love her products as well. I even found a stylist in my hair that do the devacut.
0446563048|5|I loved Tony's candid tales of his commercial activities from University through until selling Zappo's. What an amazing ride! I also made a visit to Zappo's in Vegas after finishing the book so could see happiness in action. In summary, I'd highly recommend reading the book before visiting as the craziness begins to make some sense.
B000005EJL|2|I don't remember ever getting this.
B00AAQRNQ8|4|I received the mouse earlier today and i am really enjoying it. It is a little bigger than i thought but that is not a big deal. The three buttons on the side are more comfortable for my thumb than i was excepting. Over all its a good mouse and the weights are really nice because without it the mouse is really light.<br /><br />The only thing i do not like about the mouse is it was kind of difficult getting the weights into the mouse but other than that can not be happier!
B0067R0APK|5|Used this app to plan daily activities while on vacation at various location around the USA.  The hourly listing was very useful .

B00NQ2ZL30|4|Everything came smoothly, not an album you'd expect from BVB but good songs nevertheless
B00005JNJ7|5|Finally something out of Hollywood that says what most Americans are thinking. Thank you Parker and Stone. Thank you so much. I can't wait to get the soundtrack.
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game. The only thing i have against it is that its got to many freezin spots in it and i hate that
0393061310|5|It was refreshing to see a theory that wasn't rife with racism or biased by religion. This really was an excellent book, definitely deserving of a read.
B00CM4VC7M|5|This was a gift for someone and they loved it. They liked the fact that you could change the arms and move the figurine into different poses.
B000GOZOP6|2|Apart from the fairly decent acting, this had to be one of the most pathetic movies I've ever tried to watch.  I wish I had read the reviews instead of just looking at the number of stars before I paid for it.<br /><br />I was expecting something like the Executioner's Song...thought provoking and serious.  This had just enough comedy in it to ruin the seriousness of the movie, and not enough to consider it a good comedy. I'd have to assume it was supposed to be a comedy since the plot made little or no sense, and it wasn't interesting enough to fully capture my attention.  Loud, blood and gore, silly attempts at LSD-like dreamscapes.  Sorry...it was a bad attempt at a Bonnie and Clyde copy in my opinion. I gave it a 2 just for the actors.
B00DAXXO98|5|You will watch all episodes practically in one sitting.  I can't wait for season 3.  Political drama that relates to the real Washington and how the machinery is greased to keep it going.
B007KX6U7W|4|I love TVD episodes with flash backs. This was a great one. I love the music and the camera angles and everything about TVD. No glitches or pauses while streaming.
0553573403|4|Martin has given us an ambitious novel with the first book of the Song of Fire and Ice series.  The plot is engaging, most of his characters are well developed, and the pacing of the novel is exquisite.  Readers of other epic fantasy series will be pleasantly surprised to find that Martin diverts from the typical &quot;farmer boy becomes hero&quot; fantasy epic. His story is smart, funny, and simply unlike the majority of fantasy on the market.  Readers who are looking for a sword and sorcery epic will be sorely disappointed; the novel is primarily concerend with the politics of Martin's fictional kingdom--magic takes a back seat to the intrigues of the court.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, my recommendation is not without some reservations.  While Martin has proved himself an able author, his writing still exhibits many of the qualities that plague authors of lesser talent.  He tends to over explain details rather than letting the readers imagination take flight and fill in the blanks.  A more talented and mature author would be able to direct the reader without unnecessarily explaining the leaps in logic or filling in between the lines.
0060763280|5|Most of the nonsense about money we got from our parents and those around us.  I hear someone say &#34;well, you can't have your cake and eat it too&#34;, the other day and I realized how frikin! dumb that was.  Of course you can have your cake!  Not only can you have your cake, you can get more cakes if you want them.  Eat them all!  And then go on vacation around the world.  Who told us that we could not reach our goals and have a great time doing it? Let's start a new saying &#34;Eat your cake and whatever you want cause every day is like your birthday!&#34;. Not that cake is good for you...but saying eat all the spinach you want misses the point, right?
B007L6VR6M|5|Great movie.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Another great Disney movie! My kids love it! I have watched the movie about 10 times already and both the adults and children in our household really enjoyed the movie.
B00FCQQ1IW|4|Very entertaining. It is a pity that the &#34;trilogy&#34; will continue for a fifth book
B007SGM084|4|...it would be. Very funny at times and unbelievable too in some respects, although I have no reference point when it comes to the Dom/Sub lifestyle. Ana's internal dialogue with her subconscious/goddess was very entertaining. Christian's journey to a whole person was interesting and I could discuss the psychological dynamics ad infinitum. I really enjoyed the last couple of chapters about Christian as a child with his new family and Christian's perspective upon meeting Ana. I truly enjoyed the series.
B0054JZC6E|3|some of the games are a little challenging and annoying, but its free. the only complaint I have is that it takes so long to be able to open new games. you have to play the same games over and over (even the boring ones)  in order to unlock new games.
B006MW3UZW|5|getting more interested in this program series... so I'm watching it too... in between surfing the net... not that bad...
B007SGLZP8|4|It was a good pass-time.  The story was well told, but I didn't get as caught up in it as I did with The Firm.
B008JGSM6G|4|Good game. Could use having more free moves, instead of being stuck for two days on the same level as it gets harder.
B00GB5ND9S|4|This is a fun game that stretches the bounds of practical physics but is just barely within the realm of believable.
B00DVKOYBM|2|For a free game, its ok.
B00GT1YES8|5|Very informative reading. I enjoy this book very much. It provides me with insight into myself.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Find the game interesting and enjoy the different levels. Not sure about how to progress to open new levels and use energy but tutorials are easy to follow and helpful
B008JFUN50|3|I thought this movie would be as good as the Bourne series but it lacked the intensity I expected.Okay but not great.
B00PTB7B34|3|ok
B000SW4DLM|5|This is one of the best \\"sci-fi\\" movies of all time.  I have watched it many times with my son and friends.  It looks great on my HDTV and sounds fantastic through my surround sound system.  This movie has a lot of hidden meanings and the more you watch it the better it gets.
B007PT3QOQ|1|I love the game play. but I cant play more then 30-45 seconds before the game crashes. then when I get back in I have to do everything again. then it crashes again.  not happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Perfect for a cheesy read :)
B000O599ZS|5|John Wayne was my favorite actor and this Western Classic was star packed. Director John Ford was tough and never truly wanted to give a compliment, but he knew a good actor when he saw one. He had directed Wayne in several other pictures to this point.<br />Now John Wayne had loyalty to his fellow actors whom he knew could bring the wood. The next time that you watch a John Wayne movie take note of the cast, you will see several regulars.These regular seen actors and actresses became<br />like Wayne's family.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in the \\" SEARCHERS.\\" Earlier I mentioned that this movie was filled with Stars, check out these four names: Jeffrey Hunter,<br />Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and Natalie Wood. You have to check this one out.
B005UDD1R6|4|Nice player wish it ran avi. Player functions are great.very easy to use and integrate with the kindle. If it played all formats would be my player of choice
B005GFPZYK|5|Awesome. Important story of our brave military men and women.
B00U39G62E|5|A raw, you-are-there mix which while not fantastic in sound quality makes the best of the available source and fully captures the fire and energy of my favorite band at their absolute peak.  If you're a Yes fan, you probably already have this, but if you don't, the only question you should have is: should I get the highlights or the full 7 show set?
0618871713|5|Brilliant graphic novel.
B0027MJU00|4|Flynn does plot twists and surprises very well, and Dark Places follows that pattern. Great book, and one that I tore through in a couple of days.

B00004RHZU|5|This sounds so cool!  I was skeptical about buying it at first, but I am for sure going to now!
0984725113|4|Short , concise and powerful small book . The authors have done their research and communicate a clear message . Their follow up book in 2014 will go in more depth.
B004X6PRO6|4|I really enjoyed reading this book. Not only very well written and researched but quite different and unique.  You can't help think about how we take our freedom for granted & how difficult it must be to live in a dictatorship.
B000005J56|5|Thanks for a top cd in my collection! You can see that the owner before me also think so....but no problems with the sound! I love it! Thanks for quickly sending too..
B00GINENG0|5|I love this game so much
B0054JZC6E|3|its great to pass time. The mini games are fun. It is not the same game over and over again, so it doesn't get boring.
B005HEFB6M|4|Loved the whole concept of the show, and this opening season had some quality episodes.  But the producers, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, kept creative control to themselves.  They wrote most of the episodes, which gave the season a very bland feel.  For instance, in &#34;Silent Enemy&#34;, that whole subplot of trying to figure out Malcolm's favorite food was just ridiculous.  And from the start, the entire temporal cold war arc was ill-conceived...  Fans wanted to see the building blocks of what would one day be The United Federation of Planets, not some of these silly stories about the crew fumbling about and making fools of themselves on Risa...  Still worth watching.  Star Trek is like sex, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good! ;-)
B00AF6B22E|4|A really entertaining movie.  If you've only seen the movie trailer, this movie is probably not going to be what you expect.  There's some really intense flying in the opening few minutes, but the rest of the movie is about a pilot dealing with substance addiction.
B0063M22QO|5|I really enjoy this game - there are lots of different towers - I also like the shading that indicates tile being available.  An &quot;undo&quot; button would be nice for players that are not too good at it, like me!

B00005JLEU|5|Animated or not, Spirited Away is one of THE best films ever made. It might have won an oscar, but it deserved 10. It's an action packed, emotional story with great characters and subplots that'll keep you amused for weeks, if not months. Watch it, even if you don't buy it. At least watch it!
0099579936|3|From what I'd heard, sounded like a fun fantasy book, so I put up with its cliché beginning (awkward, disheveled girl-next-door \\"stumbles\\" into super hot guy's office and he is immediately entranced...oh brother). At first I found the sexual tension and build-up to their relationship entertaining and hard to put down. After that, the terrible, lazy, monotonous writing just got in the way, making it a tedious read. Enough with the blushing and the lip-biting and the breath-hitching and the British diction for American characters. And Christian was straight out of Ellis's American Psycho; I found his transformation into \\"lovesick puppy\\" so inauthentic.

0393061310|5|Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning work dares to tackle one of the oldest, most difficult, and at times uncomfortable questions about development of human civilization. Why was it that the civilizations of the continent of Eurasia* achieve the most technological advancement, written language, productive farming techniques, and military power? Why were the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia technologically 'backward' by comparison?<br /><br />For centuries the answers to these questions was racial and cultural supremacy, such as that the west was simply better than the other 'lesser' peoples. We now quickly and correctly identify such thoughts as hateful, racist, and counter-productive, but questions still remain and often we do not know how to begin to ask them. In recent times the trend for historical revisionists is to try to focus on the strengths of the conquered cultures and explaining that their down fall was due to disease or dishonorable trickery. Nevertheless, more questions remain, if disease was such a factor why was it only one way, and why were the Europeans able to fool their opponents at times easily? Diamond dares to try to tackle these questions head on.<br /><br />\\"The time is now ripe for a fresh look at these questions, because of new information from scientific disciplines seemingly remote from human history. Those disciplines include, above all, genetics, molecular biology, and biogeography as applied to crops and their wild ancestors; the same disciplines plus behavioral ecology, as applied to domestic animals and their wild ancestors; molecular biology of human germs and related germs of animals; epidemiology of human diseases; human genetics; linguistics; archaeological studies on all continents and major islands; and studies of the histories of technology, writing and political organization.\\"p.26<br /><br />Diamond rejects all of the racist and revisionist arguments pointing out that no race or group of people is stronger, smarter, more capable, creative, or more cruel and ruthless. All humans are the same--that is not to say that all individuals are the same and equally as capable, but any large group of humans is just as good as any other. There is no 'master race,' no group of human beings proven superior to every other group of human beings. Diamond successful argues that since people adapt to their environment, often environmental factors determine how a civilization will develop. A good example would be a person from Florida who would find Maine winters intolerable and while someone from Maine would like wise find Floridian summers unbearable. Humans are creatures of their environment and the societies they build are products of the environment as well.<br /><br />Various environmental factors such as how fertile the land is, what types of crops grow, the abundance of large animals that can domesticated, and geographic features. Australia, with rare exception, has terrible land for farming which is why its native population was still in the Stone Age in the 1800s, the Americas have no great animals capable of domestication that put them in at a great military and physical disadvantage. Without great beasts to domesticate they would miss out on a good source of food and would have no Calvary. Animals were also the source of diseases that the Europeans were able to build immunities that peoples native to the Americas were not.<br /><br />Diamond's narrative is a bit difficult and technical even for an advanced reader. Although when he discusses his personnel adventures his narrative becomes more clear, the center chapters that focus and agriculture and farm animals are very tough to plow through. I highly recommend this book, but it is something to be tackled more at the graduate level.<br /><br />*One thing that I strongly agree with Diamond on, is that Europe and Asia are not two continents but one big continent.ive, or more cruel and ruthless.

B001C08RHA|5|Received Iron Man 2 very quickly and the dvd played perfectly. I recommend that everyone buy from this company if you want Super Fast Delivery and dvd's that you can guarantee will work, perfectly.
B007Z9RAX4|1|I gave this movie a full hour to develop and yet it kept dragging. The plot is the usual as other spy double cross movies and it just seemed like it was not going to deviate much from it. Maybe the ending will be good, but I could not take it any longer. First movie in a long time I had to stop watching.

0345803485|1|This is such a whiney piece of ### I don't know where to start.  Too much angst. I'm a mom.  I observe angst all day.  Why would I want to read about it?  You could cut out 2/3 of this book and not notice.  At least it wouldn't be as long. This is almost vanilla.  No heat but a lot of smoke. I'm sure this is because it was written while stoned. The sex is juvenile.  You wonder if this girl just came out of a convent except that nuns are more worldly about sex.  It's only good for unintentional laughs- and not too many of those. I couldn't care about the main characters. There is no plot.  It's just rambling about art, music, fancy clothes, why am I so stupid? he is so hot! he's so rich! MY Friends are rich? OMG did I just do that? She is the Urquel of romantic heroines.<br /><br />Women are not getting enough if this is popular.  It's like getting excited over a damp wash cloth.<br /><br />There are better stories like this out there. For instance \\"Dominated by a Billionaire\\"- series.[[ASIN:B007VA2HEY Anything He Wants (Dominated By The Billionaire)]]  It's a lot more plausible, steamier, and not nearly as whiney.  If you really like the BDSM stuff look into the 'Brie' series by Red Pheonix-.  It's a more explicit and deals with a series of partners a young woman has on in her training to be a sub.

But I'd rather do that the watch this pathetic, American remake. This movie is a true example of why some movies should not be remade. Enjoy the original and pitch this one in the garbage.

B00006G8G1|5|BUY IT!!!! This is a great DVD.  It is heavy on the stuff from Brave New World, but that's because they were on the BNW tour when they recorded this.  Overall great show, the crowd was really into it, although this is more evident on the cd's IMO.  I only have two minor objections: 1- MORE BASS!!! kinda quiet. 2- Editing, looks like a toddler on caffine edited it. <br /> <br />Overall Great!
145162445X|3|Besides Lawrence Krauss explaining what science understands about matter and energy coming out of our reality's \\"nothing\\" (this universe's fabric of space/time); this book surprisingly serves as a nice introduction to the universe's origin and attributes as they're currently understood.  \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" services the cosmological topic quite nicely, but at the expense of what motivated so many of us to purchase this book after watching Dr. Krauss' now famous speech.  That speech went viral on YouTube because it contained a short segment on the current nature of \\"nothing\\"; according to Dr. Krauss instability sufficient enough to create universes.  Sadly, the topic of `nothing' is given short shrift here for a book-length treatise.<br /><br />For those who've read the Brian Greene books on cosmology and theoretical physics and were able to keep up, you won't be well served here since Dr. Krauss doesn't cover the state of theoretical physics at near the breadth or detail that Dr. Greene presents.  Except that is, when it comes to Krauss' hypothesis about how our [seemingly flat] universe arose out of \\"nothing\\".<br /><br />However if you're like me and find it a challenge to completely comprehend all Dr. Greene's explanations, Krauss' book serves nicely to re-introduce this material in an easier to understand mode, though a shallower more personal perspective than Greene's who makes an ardent effort to provide a more representative perspective of physics.  Most disconcerting is that Dr. Krauss doesn't spend hardly any time on the nature of nothing outside our own space/time, like what is our universe expanding into and other elements of nothing outside our own universe.<br /><br />I did greatly appreciate Dr. Krauss' lucid explanation of \\"nothing\\" in our space/time and why a net zero energy universe is an elegant explanation in reconciling a godless Big Bang, which is also consistent with our observation that our universe if flat.  But that material could have been covered in a long magazine article or the type of e-book-only volumes Sam Harris is now writing.been covered in a long magazine article or the type of e-book-only volumes Sam Harris is now writing.

B00AAQRNQ8|5|I received the mouse quickly. I held off on writing a review until after I used the Mouse for some time. Its lasted my unrelenting hours of gaming. It fits my hand very well and is of decent quality, i just wish the material on the side wasn't glossy.The only thing i did not like was the way you have to get the software for the mouse. You also have to macro the buttons on the mouse to the keyboard to get any use from them. Overall i give it a 9/10 every issue is something i can live with for the price I paid.

B00B2G2RG6|3|First of all it was really hyped up.  I've had scarier dreams.  Anyway, it is obsurd to believe that one incarcerated serial killer has soooo many followers and can pick up more along the way.  Not gonna happen. Perhaps he might get alot of fan mail in jail but not alot of people who want to kill other people to please him even if he does give them artistic license and don't have to copy him exactly.  Ahhhh....the arts!  Kevin Bacon is okay but thank goodness there are a plethora of other actors and actresses to take your attention away from him. I got bored after episode 2 and have now quit watching all together after episode 3.  Maybe the serial killer can kill the series or find a way to eiminate all his &#34;followers&#34;.
B003BWERF8|4|This BT adapter works very well as advertised.  I bought it mainly so I could use my iPod Nano 6th Gen (w/touch screen) on a wrist band without having a headphone cord bouncing all over as I run.  It synced very quickly with my headphones.  Since it is powered by the Nano, it causes the Nano power to drain more quickly, but it would easily last 3-4 hours still.  My headphones die before then, so I'm not exactly sure how long.      Also, I tested it by syncing it with my car stereo, which worked also.  In both cases, I didn't even need to enter a PIN to make them sync, which is good, because the Nano doesn't have a way to enter a PIN.  So this product performed exactly as was advertised.    The only reason I didn't give a five star rating is because of the couple of minor Cons I found.  Because the BT adapter plugs into the charging port of the iPod, you can't be charging the iPod at the same time.  While running, no issue.  However, if I were wanting to listen to music on a long road-trip, then being able to use the BT and charge at the same time would be handy.  Also, the instruction manual says that the other devices must have common PINs, like 0000, 1111, 1234, etc.  So if the device you are trying to sync your iPod to has an unusual PIN, then it may not work.    I am very happy with this purchase.

B007FEFLTO|3|So maybe I read too fast, but the political intrigues and minutiae really bogged me down.  By the end, I found myself just skimming over the &#34;he said, she said, spy vs spy&#34; stuff, as I just couldn't keep straight who was in what political party, who the (real life) leaders were and what battle was happening with which division.  If I ever read this again, I'll truly need to keep a notebook with me and jot down who is who, all after spending time researching the differences in Communism, Labour, Nazis, Fascists, etc., and who hated who and who supported who.  The characters got lost in the real history & politics.

B007STXHTM|2|This is not a great housing. The large rectangular glass covering the lens also obstructs the view of the front screen. If you are filming underwater and then surface, you can count on water droplets messing up your shot with the increased surface area. Before I purchased this I was using a third party replacement flat lens that fit right in my original housing by removing the screws and bubble lens, and replacing it with a flat lens. It had worked great for the past year, but the housing buttons recently started sticking and the lens had minor scuffs. It seemed cheaper and more convenient to get the official Gopro dive housing, instead of a new original housing and flat lens, and I'm sorry I did. There are better alternatives.
B0052UZIFA|4|I've played this game on a variety of platforms including on Google Chrome, Firefox, Nintendo DS, and the Apple Maxipad.<br /><br />The game is consistently fun.  Nothing like encouraging the green in you to wack some zombies with pea shooters.  The kids love this game with its faux violence.  Perhaps it will encourage them to eat their vegetables too!<br /><br />The graphics are fine for what it is.  I feel its important to focus more on game play than it is on graphics.  Pop Cap has it right with this formula game and the price on Amazon is PERFECT!  ITs FREE.  How can you beat that?<br /><br />Even at $2.99, its still worth it.  Hopefully they'll come up with some additional sequels which keep the fun and the campy pixelated graphics.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this game.  Well worth it.<br /><br />The Nintendo DS version is also quite good and leverages the pen.  Played on HTC EVO and Barnes & Noble Color Nook.  Nook Color rocks!

B001RCD2DW|4|I was very excited to finally get these headphones, they look vey nice.I purchased these  to use in a studio, so being bulky is not an issue, but I cannot see me using them while jogging or working out.  I was somewhat disappointed that the arched part is made of plastic, also no case. the leather adjustment strap seems a little too stiff, after almost an hour of use, I started feeling  pressure on my head. I am hoping they'll get softer in time.  the part that goes over the ears is very comfortable, although I wish the pads were made of leathery material rather than velvet, it will be much easier to keep them clean and less itchy.  although they feel tight on my head, when I lower my head or raise it, I feel a slight shift. this is only the physical review, I expect them to be more comfortable in time.  Sound quality is as advertised, one of the best ones I'd ever used in my studio, they're only 62 ohm, which works great in my studio setup. Just like everything else, it will take sometime to get use to them, but I can see them being my go to headphones.

B0009I7NNA|4|I don't even know why I'm bothering to put the following information in this review, because it's more or less become common knowledge to A7X fans and haters alike, but for all those unknowing newcomers, I'll put it in: yes, Avenged Sevenfold's style has changed. While their older stuff as heard in \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\" was mainly metalcore, A7X took the \\"core\\" out of their music and decided to go with straightforward metal, influenced heavily by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. But what I'd like to know is: why are so many people convicting A7X of ditching their old metalcore style for a \\"boring, punk rock-like sound\\"? In reality, their new style is closer to that of classic metal than punk. Most of the people who say this usually know very little about what metal actually is; if they did, they might appreciate this album for how rare a find it is in today's modern metal scene and how much the band has progressed since their debut. The music has changed, there's no denying it, but in my opinion, it's definitely for the better. The same anthemic songs and chugging guitars are still there, but this time they are presented with seemingly less repetition. A7X was always above the rest of the metalcore crowd, and their new album places them even farther up on the list, denouncing their former metalcore roots for a more (dare I say it) accessible sound that even devout metalheads can appreciate.<br /><br />And anyway, the band has very justifiable reasons for their change in style. First and foremost, lead vocalist M. Shadows' vocal cords became damaged after countless shows filled with intense screaming and he had to get throat surgery if he ever wanted to sing again. Following the surgery, he began working with a vocal instructor, and now he does nothing but sing. This can be both a blessing and a curse; a blessing because now his everpresent growls (which actually sounded painful, seeing as they  didn't sound like he trained his voice, most likely leading to his vocal damage) are no longer present, and a curse because this hampers his ability to perform older songs in concert. But still, the screaming in their previous works was somewhat annoying, and the voice coaching he took have done him some good. Also, it seems that, vocal damage or not, A7X had change in mind; an interview with M. Shadows in Alternative Press revealed that he and the band were tired of being heaped up with the other hardcore bands of their caliber and wanted to be more than just another teenage obsession. And I must agree, because there are too many bands with screaming vocals and simple guitar riffs.<br /><br />Now that I've used up half a page on that, I'll get to reviewing the album itself. The guitar style has gone from the chugga-chugga rhythm of American metal to the more complex riffing of European metal (though not to the extremity that the actual European bands use), and solos are more common than ever, with each song displaying at least one by guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates. The drum parts provided by The Reverend (yes, I know they're slightly tacky names, but the music is good, so I'll let it slide) seem more thought out this time around, with some excellent footwork and drumming that keeps the beat rather than reminding you what the beat is. The bass can't be heard all that well because of the cleaner production, but in those few moments when it becomes obvious (like at the beginning of \\"The Wicked End\\"), it sounds beautiful and soothing. And, last but not least, M. Shadows' vocals are more melodic and clean this time around (but also heavily layered at some points), and the best part is that he actually trained his voice before setting out on this escapade, making his vocals sound like he's actually comfortable singing.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a definite improvement over the last two albums with its wider variety (\\"Sidewinder\\" actually breaks into a pseudo-flamenco part at the end)and larger talent in each individual part. So, before you go judging the band for alienating their fan base (I think the fans are at fault for reacting so negatively), give this CD a listen and try not to focus on the change of style, but instead on the pureness of the music itself. Though most of my early metal bands aren't near the top of my list anymore because I've discovered something of more value to me, Avenged Sevenfold \\"City of Evil\\" still remains in my top 15 favorite metal albums because of its dissimilarity to most other popular American metal bands of our time.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Beast and the Harlot\\", \\"Trashed and Scattered\\", and \\"Strength of the World\\"<br /><br />9/10ach individual part.

0743454537|5|This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I ever read.  I found that the flashbacks from Sara were helpful in showing where her loyalties were, on Kate or Anna.  While I find that a character like Jesse is stereotypical in this type of novel, he provides an interesting viewpoint and is a chance to escape the drama of the novel for a while.  One problem that I had with the book was in the way it was designed.  I did not like how different fonts were used for different characters.  I understand why Picoult would do this, but to me it seems unneccessary.  The book brings up some great issues on what promises to be more and more in the spotlight as science and biology progress.  A book that I definitely recommend.
0767903862|4|On a white hot sunny afternoon in July, which seemed to fit the excruciating description of Bill's trip with his friend Allan to Alice Springs. I particularly enjoyed the Perth and New South Wales bits for their greeness and freshness, and what a rousing introduction for me into the world of travel books after six years of what has mostly been high-brow literature! I relished every anecdote, but here is a warning: if you are a fan of the high-brow literature Bryson's prose is disappointingly without song. He is funny, and a tremendous source of information, but he abuses abstract adjectives like 'splendid,' 'comfortable,' and phrases like 'of course.' Perhaps these terms are the trademark of travel writing; since I am new to the field I can't say for sure. All in all, though, this book was 'splendid.' I am off to ship it to my father in Ohio. I am hoping he will find it 'splendid' as well.
B000V39KDO|5|The quality of this download was amazing. And it took only about 2 minutes to download the software, register my device and load the video. We'll be doing this more often!
B00794ML3Y|5|Very well written and authentic. I like that the therapist is a human being with flaws (we all have them). I enjoyed the characters.<br />I am going to borrow the rest from the library, as I think it is too expensive to purchase.
B00P77ZAN8|5|Worth playing,  ez to figure out. Lots of fun
B00IBQ5LMW|5|Very cool show.  Bruce is so cool (\\"it's kind of a freaky experience, the whole thing.\\").  And Jon Stewart as host is perfect (he idolizes Bruce). There is so much good here.<br /><br />My personal favorite performances are:<br /><br />ALABAMA SHAKES - \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\"<br />MAVIS STAPLES and ZAC BROWN - \\"My City of Ruins\\"<br />TOM MORELLO and JIM JAMES - \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" (Freakin' amazing!)<br />and all of the Bruce performances, of course.  The Big Man, Clarence Clemons' nephew plays sax, btw.  That's special.<br />Oh, and Bruce's speech was pretty damned entertaining too.<br /><br />Springsteen fans need this in their collections.
B00864YXMS|5|Excelente version de Lego. Capta perfectamente la escena del juego ayudando a revivir la pelicula jugando y aprendiendo a armar la estructura
1451620829|3|Makeup to Breakup is Peter Criss' attempt to cement his legacy in KISS while slinging some mud at his former band mates.  He does a great job with the latter, not so much with the former.  In the book, Criss does his own version of Behind the Music, detailing his rise through low level bands to his meeting up with Gene and Paul, slogging through gigs in front of few people and building their way up to arenas, only to see his own fortunes plummet as he sinks into drug abuse and is kicked out of a band he no longer enjoys playing for.<br /><br />While Peter Criss spares no detail in describing his and his bandmates disgusting exploits on the road, he gives us little if anything about the music, the albums, or the movies.  We get a great sense for why being in KISS sucked later in the band's years, but little sense of why it was a blast.  Worst of all,  he fails to create much sympathy for himself, as spends much of the book blaming others for his own stupidity and excess, which borders on inhumane and disgusting in parts.<br /><br />Still, some parts are affecting, like his discussion of his experiences in rehab, and his bout with breast cancer.<br /><br />Makeup to Breakup is the type of memoir that sells, dishing the dirt.  Unfortunately, the lack of humanity under the layer of filth has you feeling empty after you read it.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Downton Abbey is fabulous because it does not insult the intelligence of its viewers. The story evolves during provocative historical times thereby catching the viewers attention not only through the characters' trials and tribulations but also through the societal challenges that they face. It is an addicting presentation as you live to find out what happens next to these most intersting people. Enjoy!
B003H9MSPG|4|It came within 4 working days to our home in the UK! The darts go further without the barrel attached, but they are more accurate and the gun looks better with the gun attached! Simple design, and great looks make this one of my favourite nerf guns!
B00A77II0U|5|Has everything you'd want in a interactive mystery puzzle. Good story. Wonderful graphics. Great puzzles. Nice set up. Moreover,  the length of playing time equals your money's worth. Alawar really knows how to produce a good one for this genre.
B003MC5N28|5|Now I can hardly wait for the other 3.
B00DSJBDLU|5|great
B00L2AUOMG|4|This is an ok game.......I was amused and entertained.  It was like a Stephen king novel though. Felt like it was a frenzied finish.
B0080CL0HM|4|I'm glad I ordered this movie for 48-hour viewing rather than saw it in a theater, because the first time I watched it I was completely bewildered by the over-orchestration and disjointed scenes --- the movie seemed to me more like a collection of vignettes and unexpected flashbacks than a traditionally flowing movie, and I was reminded of the fact that this is the first film by a pair of directors who had previously worked only in the theater. However, even though I didn't watch the movie again all the way through, I re-viewed large sections of it, and found that the more I watched it the more I appreciated the acting and production values.<br /><br />This is definitely Rob Pattinson's movie - he's in every scene and nearly every frame of the film, and all the other characters are planets orbiting around him. If there are any emotions that he did not get to convey in this movie, I can't think of them, and I would imagine that making this film was a very intense experience for him. He \\"looks the part\\" in this period drama, but since his physical appearance is important to the character, there are elegant scenes where he could have used a shave and a shampoo; none of the other men in these scenes have greasy hair and a five-o'clock shadow, and it's an \\"eeew\\" factor that distracts from his otherwise amazing face.<br /><br />I loved the performances by Thurman, Ricci, and Thomas, because even though their characters behaved similarly to each other in the social scenes, they each broke down in a different way that really defined their characters. The other male characters were more ancillary, but also well-cast.<br /><br />The movie is visually beautiful, although as I mentioned earlier, the background music is way too much (and I'm a classical musician, so if anything, I should have enjoyed all the classically-oriented music). If you like period dramas, I would recommend this movie.
B0091W1RY6|5|Three nights in a row amazing.
B00C2VGAW2|2|How lazy are these artists becoming, Jay Z and William produced half baked half hearted music for a soundtrack to make a quick buck.  Pathetic, the only ray of hope on the whole album is Fergie's everything else is just garbage.  Dont waste your money.
B00LV4PZ3G|5|I like it
B00ETADXY2|3|I like
B005ZB91KY|4|the special effects in shrinking down the main character in the beginning of this movie are nothing short of an Oscar worthy editing process! I was just amazed at how and what they did to make this possible - and whatever it was - it was indeed 100% believable and fantastic!<br /><br />The story is actually right on par with Captain America's values and why he fights so hard.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this first movie and will one day just purchase the movie so that I can have it in my movie vault for that time when we want to have a rainy weekend of Avengers movies all done in chronological order!
B000001EL3|5|love this album. one of my favorite bands!
B000002KYK|4|Not as good as the original Vangelis soundtrack, but rather comfortable. A curious alternative rendition, nice and lazy.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Very fun to play
0783222955|5|I am an 8th grade girl, and I was assinged to read To Kill A Mockingbird  over the summer. At first, I thought it was quite boring, but then it got  interesting, and I couldn't put it down. I hate to read, and this is a book  I would read over and over again. The movie is just a great, and Gregory  Peck is just incredible. Scout and Jem were fantastic as well. I would  recommend the book and movie to anyone. I would also like to add that these  reviews aren't a joke, and this book/movie should be appreciated, as it is  the best book I have ever read, and the best movie I have ever seen.
B0099225QM|5|Life changing!
B00192KCQ0|5|Listen to the cd, enjoy the fact that they are still around and can write memorable music, and don't compare it to past albums or current bands that they've inspired. Just enjoy it, really a fun listen. No reason to read into it.
B00MJ114YE|5|love the two doctors
B003B02OOG|5|Great stories.  Imaginative and entertaining views of small town US.
B00DI75SWM|4|I agree that the boxes should be moveable, that's the only issue I have.<br /><br />It's great for making mini posters and signs for work and home. I print them using a Wi-Fi printer on my network all the time.<br /><br />I have made them as jokes for friends and put them in frames, I have made them as quiet reminders for myself and set them as wallpapers on my phone.<br /><br />I think the app is worth the whole whooping $0.99 I paid.
B009A9ETFE|5|i love the music and the new song is totally cool! well worth the money and more. so glad i ordered it
B009ZQC7MY|5|Downton abbey is amazing!
B000SGSU58|3|I have read many books by Michael Connelly and they are always entertaining. This was my first book I read on my Kindle and I had to get used to the shorter pages, but I still turned them at a pretty fast pace. Connelly surprises you with the twists and turns he developes. This was not the best I have read by him, but it certainly won't be the last.
B0083B3KOQ|5|This really very good
B001KVZ6HK|5|We really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.  We got a great price, right around $20.  Fun, exciting, and entertaining.  Would have liked more instructions on the digital download.
B000HC2LI0|5|I received this item in perfect condition and ready to wrap for a Christmas Gift.  Thank you so much.  I was very impressed.
B000IZC7WG|1|Cannot hear dialogue only noises in background. Could only get dialogue from closed caption. Gave up on film.
B009RI4FRU|5|It was a very original idea and a great story. Loved it, everyone young and old will enjoy this movie.
B000TKW3E2|5|Beautiful music.  I love how Dario writes so \\"Classically\\".  One of the best soundtracks I will ever own.  My favorite tracks: \\"Love Letters\\" and \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\".
B007ZGBZHE|4|Normally, I have a little trouble with so many different characters, but the author made. It fairly easy for me.  As usual, it was hard for me to put down.
1484721837|5|If Ii can get my 15 yr old to pick up a book and read it from beginning to end willingly then this is great.  And so he did. : )
B00992CF6W|4|not as robust as the PC version, but a good time killer if your waiting somewhere.<br /><br />Could have more items in creation mode however, I dont understand why that is so limited, the size of the items couldnt be that much, I wonder if Mojang will correct this.
B000069CWE|5|It is pointless to pick this amazing release from Linkin Park apart on a song by song basis, because the whole album holds together as a single, throbbing unit!!  While Hybrid Theory was an exciting effort from this band, Reanimation is an entirely new and much more powerful experience.  The songs flow together seamlessly and take the listener on an emotionally challenging journey.  Crank it up and take off!!
B00008GKEG|5|And I had to have it again on DVD...love this series. Watched it all in a week and will watch again in another couple of months.
0143121006|5|I had never heard of this case before I did a random search for books on cold cases and this popped up. I thought it sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The book came quickly and was in great condition. I started reading right away and could hardly put it down. The author has written this strange tale in a very engaging way and I was drawn into the story immediately. I particularly enjoyed the details in the place settings, which really helped me paint a mental picture of 1930's Peking and the types of people who moved in the city's social and political circles. At the end of it all, I found the author's conclusion of what probably happened very convincing and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I would urge anyone interested in true crime, cold cases or Chinese subjects to check out this book. A solid buy.
B009JZWO3I|5|The law portion is very unrealistic, but the characters are fascinating.  Glad to be done but I will miss everyone.
B00C8S9W0G|3|Like many series , it is becoming predictable and formulaic. Still an OK read. Maybe part of the ugh factor had to do with anticipation.
B000FBFN1U|5|I must be reading the wrong books, because by far this is still some of the best storytelling I've come across in a long time.  Read it, read it, and read it!
6305922756|4|this movie is laugh out loud funny done by rob riener or legendary meat head if it was on a scale of 1 to 10 i would have to give this movie 11 \\"does that make it better\\" \\"well yes its one better isnt it\\" smell the glove is a great album \\"you ask how much blacker could this be and the answer is none\\" just see it its funny...
B0084B5TK8|5|I absolutely loved this book.  I read it as an audio book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The narrators were excellent and had me entranced especially at the end when they were about to destroy Dracula.<br /><br />I would highly recommend you purchase the Audible and listen to the book rather than read it as is. It would be more enjoyable that way.
B004DLPXAO|1|I use kindle for IPad and Kindle fire and it seems that amazon has \\"forgotten\\" to add very importent features. It is so much better to surf using kindle fire or a ipad. if you have not tried it  you dont know what you are missing. I love my android and will not traded off so i am trading amazon Kindle to alternative service's that have better features across all platforms. After all that is why i chose Amazon to not get marraid to one platform. that sad thing is that they do have the app that works on android they just dont give it to non kindle fire users. Amazon i am one very disiponted customer!!!!!! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!!
B00QW8TYWO|5|The grandkids and I had a lot of fun with this over the weekend. Worth a thousand times the price ! [which is nothing by the way]
B0074D3CAQ|5|I loved this book! it was a heartfelt account of a man's journey to become something more than he was. This is an excellent discussion book. It is best to read it when you are unrushed and can stop and think.
B0012CJQY6|5|All I gotta say is wow. I'm a big fan of TV on DVD and have been searching for my next show to get into. I have all the 24 seasons, all the Lost seasons (my two favorites...until now), and was looking for something to watch since I'm all caught up on those two shows and prefer serial type shows.<br /><br />I decided to give Shield a shot remembering the glowing reviews (and controversy) it had when it first came out back in...well, whenever it came out (sorry, currently too lazy to dig for that particular fact).<br /><br />I can say that the first season of The Shield was probably some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a TV  show. It is on par with some of the best movie dramas ever made. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has not seen it before (those folks like me looking for TV on DVD they haven't seen before). I can only hope that further seasons live up to this first one.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Good story line. Gripping Drama. Tom Cruise at his best. Yes, I would recommend to someone else if they like action drama.
B00BAXFECK|2|I tried to like this book and struggled to finish it. It was very tedious reading. The writing style was  disjointed , vacillating and borrowing from other authors and books such as Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky , The Girl With The Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier and A million Little Pieces by James Frey.  A troubled youth suffering from posttraumatic syndrome following a museum bombing and subsequent theft of a major piece of art provided an interesting plot line. However, the book soon became tedious to the point of boring. The author is clearly a skilled literary writer, but this book missed the mark. Sorry, but this book reminded me of several other literary works that resulted in a story that was difficult to read and at times a mirror image of those other literary works.
1594630844|5|I thought this book was fantastic. I am 56 so I am getting ready to reach this phase of my life but the book was full of wonderful advice. I want my children ages 27 and 24 to read it.  It is full of good advice for a young person. I highly recommend it,
B008YKGQR4|5|I chose full Facebook free because I could see everything clearly. I like everything about it. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B007N85POS|4|Very good I suggest you get it
B000AJIF4E|4|These headphones are very much worth the price.  I have approximately 20-30 high-end headphones.  I have spent as much as $900.00 for the top of the high-end headphones.  Each set offers different things that are wonderful.<br /><br />The Sony 7506 is no frills.  No leather covered earpads or aluminum fittings.  They fit snugly, but not as constrictive as Sennheiser 600 or 650.  They do not float on your head like the audiophile Audio-Technica models which are excellent.  The earpads fit on the ear rather than surrounding the ear like Audio-Technica.  The phones are closed back and achieve a very good seal as to outside noise.<br /><br />As far as sound, I cannot say that they are flat sounding.  They have an immediate sound stage.  You feel you are on stage with the musicians.  There is no sense of separation from the sources of the music.  The sound is very joyful and dynamic. They are very easily driven by an Ipod.  I have not heard them with a headphone amplifier.  I suspect that a headphone amplifier might make them sound overripe if not on the low gain setting.<br /><br />Often times, I prefer an open-backed headphone because it seems to give you a sound that has more space in it.  I like the more subtle approach, but these headphones do not seem too close.<br /><br />On a technical note, the headphones appear to be made of plastic rather than lightweight metal.  The wires that go to each earcup of the headphones are exposed so that they could be pulled if you do not use them very carefully.  One thing you will note from the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 (which is approximately the same price) is that the wires to each of the earcups is hidden inside frame of the headphones.  Additionally, I believe (although I am not sure)that the headphone frames of the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 are metal with metal fittings.  I cannot comment on how long the Sony headphones will last because I have only owned the 7506 for a month or so.  At the same price, you might want to consider the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 or the Grado SR-80.<br /><br />In short, if you are not a fanatical collector of headphones and only want to purchase one pair, this is an excellent choice.  By the way, by having more than one set of headphones, you in effect have several different stereos--each sounding rather different than the other.  To achieve sound of this caliber from speakers, you would have to spend thousands of dollars to get the quality of sound a listener with good headphones can get from an Ipod featuring huge memory and portability.  Lastly, you will not burden everyone around you in your family with having to listen to the same music you are listening to your music.
B008JLEUD0|5|Love it! I have played in more than 3x the first day I got it.<br />It is in my office now....
B008OP32M6|5|This is the most expensive lego set I've ever purchased, but it was worth it!  Super solid body with no worries of little pieces falling off should the truck roll over or topple.  Suspension and clearance allows for driving over anything in reason, and the durable cog pieces (unlike some earlier technic models) prevent gear strippage.  It doesn't move very fast, and it's a bit top heavy with the battery box and body, but still a blast to drive around the yard or house.  Alternate model instructions available for download at lego.com, but I wouldn't bother- it's quite ugly, throws the weight balance off, and requires no sticker placement, so, if they're already applied, it's just going to look odd.  It took me 2 solid days of building to complete, so coming off surgery with time to kill, this was an ideal boredom stopper.  Alternate model build took a day with the disassembly of the primary, building secondary, testing the secondary, stripping the secondary and going back to the primary (alternate build requires only stripping down to the chassis).  All in all, very impressed with this latest entry into the technic line-up,  as it has come a long way in the last 15 years!  Highly recommend it, but order directly from lego.com, free shipping and you can rack up $10 in free discounts for future purchases if you sign up for an account.
0760316414|3|Ok, so I bought this book to be able to learn how to draw and sketch cars. It only covers about 3 sections on how to draw a car and that's about it. The rest of the book goes into detail about different car designers, how they think on when they are designing a car and towards the end it gets into actually how to draw the cars. The book is nice in material and has a very nice weight to it and the pictures are also printed nicely.<br /><br />This book is good if you want to learn about the thought of designing, but not a how to draw cars book.<br /><br />I was hoping for more details on parts of the body of the vehicles and the terminology when drawing the vehicles, more explanations on what parts do, and also on how to draw it in detail and not just in sketch mode.<br /><br />All in all, the book is designed well, looks good, has good information on the designing thought behind the designers of some of the cars we see on the road today and it has a directory on the back with several schools one can go to for learning to design vehicles and also all of the different car companies.<br /><br />Not a bad read, but not a how to learn to draw cars book.
B005F6NA56|4|I have been a fan of Feist since i heard mushaboom in a lacoste cologne commercial back in 2005 and she never fails to deliver. Her music has little nooks and crannies of listening treats layered in.
B004SIP8QQ|5|fun movie. got it for 2 dollars.
0143120530|5|This book details Joshua Foer as he becomes acquainted with memory contests.  As a bonus, it also describes how to actually use the memory techniques that the pros use.  It is unbelievable how well the 'memory palace' works, and how easy it is to pick up.  Your brain will never be the same (in a good way)!
B006C1DH92|5|Very strange that some Vibrant owners have reported problems, as I've had none.  I'm running Ice Cream Sandwich.  I wonder if that may have something to do with it.  Nice app.
B007JM4CWY|5|$5 seems a little steep at first, but keep 2 things in mind: 1) the implementation is awesome, 2) You'd easily pay the price for a puzzle magazine at the store. Since downloading, this app has been slowly taking the place of my sleep at night.
B00A7OIXW6|5|This movie is one of my Disney favorites! All the characters are wonderful, even the bad guys don't seem overly bad.  My boys, ages 4 and 5 love Ralph and Felix and want to watch this movie over and over.
B00005JLT5|5|THE PIANIST [Adrian Brody / Directed by Roman Polanski / 150 minutes / Rated R for violence and brief strong language]<br />\\"The Pianist\\", Roman Polanski's remarkable drama about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland in the early 1940s, is the best depiction of the subject since Steven Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\"; in fact, in some respects it is a better movie. While Spielberg and his family grew up in the safety of the United States, Polanski [born in 1933] and his clan were Polish victims of the Nazi atrocities. If there is a problem with \\"The Pianist\\", it is that some viewers will find it too painful to watch. This is a horror movie in the literal sense because it depicts man at his worst in real life. To this day, I have difficulty accepting emotionally that all this occurred just sixty years ago, though intellectually I know that it did. <br />Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladslaw Szpilman, who was on track to becoming one of Europe's foremost performers when the Nazis invaded Poland. Within months, he, his family and more than 500,000 other Warsaw Jews were crammed into a ghetto comprising a few city blocks. It wasn't long before more and more people disappeared, having been shipped off to concentration camps. The pianist uses every trick he can think of to survive in a living nightmare which goes on and on and only gets worse. <br />Mr. Brody won Best Actor and Mr. Polanski Best Director at this year's Oscars. At the time it seemed a surprise upset to many people. In retrospect, the awards were richly deserved. <br />Because of its subject matter, \\"The Pianist\\" isn't suited for everyone. [Children should have a grasp of history before seeing it, for example. But it is also very rewarding and a great example of the art of movies.
B00SH00N3Y|5|Totally awesome, weird, but awesome.
B000AL730O|5|Paul has truly created a dark, brooding, introspective classic. It's as if he is sitting in front of you spilling out his heart. I agree with many that it does get better with each listen, however I enjoyed it from the first play. Nothing cute or \\"silly\\" about this music. <br /> <br />There is no huge \\"radio friendly\\" hits, however I find all the songs to be solid without a clunker in the bunch (ok, English Tea is a slight incomplete throw away). <br /> <br />The sound is tight, melancholy and mature (kind of funny to say Paul is now \\"mature\\" at 63), from the thumping opening number \\"Fine Line\\" to the beautiful \\"Jenny Wren\\" (yes, much like \\"Blackbird\\"), to my favorite song on the CD, the closing sweeping \\"Anyway\\". <br /> <br />I encourage anyone who has \\"given up\\" on Paul to listen to this CD and give it a chance. I'd also recommend recent stand outs like \\"Flaming Pie\\" (Beatle \\"esc\\" mode) and \\"Run Devil Run\\" (Rocker mode). <br /> <br />Paul is making some of his best music since the early 1970's and  this started with his \\"Flaming Pie\\" CD. No doubt this will be a big hit with fans and critics (for once!) a like. I also see a ton of Grammy's in Paul's future. <br /> <br />Pure excellence! Thanks Paul.
B00BB8RKH6|4|But once the crash occurred, to me it was pretty predictable. The only question was which way would he go...would he hide his secret, lie, and get away without being punished, or own up to it and get the help he needed. The rest, in between, was predictable.
B00DPM7TIG|4|Hard to,get into but after a few chapters could not put it down
0375826726|5|Amazing narrative and details in this wonderful saga for Eragon. I love Christopher Paolini's trilogy. I am only sadden because I would love to read more.
B005LY4B0A|5|Many hours of enjoyment, well worth it. The puzzles are often surprisingly clever but still easy enough to solve within a little while (though you'll keep going back to get that third star, over and over again)--but there are also hints every twelve hours. Thank you for this clever game.
B00OKYQZDI|4|Very entertaining
B001GCUER0|1|I don't get it, the rave reviews, the awards, totally unreal.  I was so excited when this show was airing, watched several episodes just hoping it would get better it never did.  The characters are bland with no substance, the plot is always the same.  The 60's were better than this show represents by a long shot. It's unreal that this series can be in the second season going on 3.  Breaking Bad is great, Rome was superb, Big Love is fantastic, The Tudors, excellant, Damages, intriguing, Dexter is interesting (& those are all the series I have or will have on dvd) but Mad Men is depressing and disappointing to the nth degree.
B001UTW7QU|5|I fell in love with Fringe midway through it-and was excited to see I can watch the entire series here on Amazon! I'm totally addicted to seeing all the seasons I missed and know I'll be sad when I catch up to where I started and then when it ends all over again.
B00KMX5V8G|5|love it
B001VZY4M8|5|Another classic!
1595141715|4|I'll keep this short, since there are other reviews that do the sum-up thing very nicely.<br /><br />This is an extremely insightful, well-written, and heart-wrenching book, which I'd highly recommend.  I'd take away maybe half a star at most because the complete absolution of the viewpoint character -- the only boy who remains utterly blameless -- seems like a cop-out to me, as if he's on the list just to be the innocent one, so that the reader, looking through his eyes, can feel \\"innocent\\" as well, can feel some distance from the subject matter. It detracts from the lesson a little bit, for me.  (Just a little.)  But the emotions explored and the situations presented feel very true and real nonetheless.<br /><br />Yes, some of the situations might be \\"R-rated,\\" sometimes terrifyingly so, but really, 1) if they were not, do you think this girl would have felt the need to commit suicide? and 2) do we really think kids are not already going through this stuff every day?<br /><br />(I especially admire that the author makes his readers aware of the nature of predators, using the character who collects sexual \\"conquests\\" like trophies, who dehumanizes his victims.  Young ladies, if you find yourself with a  young man who makes you feel as if you are not there, as if you are somehow less of a person than he is, listen to your gut feelings and get the heck out.  Actually, young men, get the heck out too -- it's not only girls who get victimized.)<br /><br />An incredible read.
B00003CX5A|4|The video worked well, no skipping or problems.  It was at times gruesome as the headless horseman was riding about the countryside chopping off heads.  Bought this movie to see how Johnny Depp did in this.  The acting was good and it would be a great movie to show at a Halloween gathering; very spooky yet not overwhelming.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Mars wants to kill you. Not in some purposeful, evil way, but in an evenhanded, passive way. It can't help being a nearly airless, frozen world any more than it can change into the rugged, but inhabitable planet envisioned by some of our early science fiction writers. This book, once you accept the idea of manned Mars missions, is science fact.  The Martian: A Novel is the ultimate left-behind story. A crew of six lands on Mars. Through a series of mishaps, the mission's Mr. Fixit and botanist is thought dead as the rest of the crew leaves under emergency conditions, leaving behind their habitat module, a couple of rovers, and short-term supplies. I won't spoil the many technological hacks, good luck and bad, and life-or-death decisions. If you know the ending, it's still an excellent read, but please keep it to yourself! I didn't know how it would turn out and the book was all the more compelling.   The Martian is thoroughly realistic, and it's somewhat heavy on the tech when it's not scaring you half to death. Do you have to be a techie to enjoy it? I think not; you could certainly skip over the science and read it for the drama.  As you may have heard, it started out somewhat crowdsourced, as Mr. Weir published chapter by chapter, with early readers helping with plausibility, the math, and other issues. Weir's account of how it became a book and (soon) movie is a tale worthy of telling in itself.

B000UDJS2S|4|Didn't see it at the movies because of less than stellar reviews, but... One to watch with your g/b friend... action for the adventurer and cheese for the romantic...two thumbs up!
B002ZG97E2|5|Rest assured if you enjoy laughter and a heartwarming tale this is your film. It's not a deeply philosophical story and may be called simple by some, but what it attempts to do it does well through the use of cleverly written characters, stylized visuals, and a great soundtrack.    The story: May not be the most original premise in the world but is presented in a very fluid manner with original and funny jokes aimed at adults and kids alike. The ending may or may not make you cry happily but odds are to the former no matter whether you're single, married, with kids, or a kid yourself. It's a story that touches anyone with parents. The characters all seemed to posses traits which viewers can identify with someone in their lives, which is very difficult to do and shows good writing (Notable use of a great portrayal of a single dad family).     The Visuals: Stylized and beautiful. The characters all have pronounced physical character, none are the stereotypical \\"beautiful\\" person yet even with their pronounced cartoonish traits they all seem very real to the viewer as believable characters with real lives, almost like caricatures of real people left over from a carnival in any random state.  Items in the movie do seem to have well-rendered visual textures, and the style of them follows the style of the people. I never noticed any horrible mistakes, everything looked wonderful.     Sound: Pharrel contributes some wonderful songs to the soundtrack that serve to show that children's movies don't have to rely entirely on recycled tunes. They are both fun and very modern sounding. In addition, the movie doe utilize a Bee Gee's disco hit: You Should Be Dancing, and the classic Boogie Fever by the Sylvers. They add the needed back beat to a couple of dance scenes that you will either love or hate, depending on your tastes. :)    The negatives and conclusion: The complaints are few. Some say the story leans too much to the main character Gru's plot, and not enough to his laterinteractions with the girls. Some complained that use of obvious 3D tricks was so prevalent that it detracted from the plot. I personally didn't think that either of these was a major issue, this movie isn't supposed to be perfect, it's supposed to entertain and touch you emotionally and I felt that it accomplished this well. Just go in expecting a fun time and you'll most likely enjoy yourself. :)
B0027MJU00|4|A book that kept me turning the pages, always dreading what the next one would say, but not able to deny my curiosity.  As a child of that culture growing up within 100 miles of the &#34;scene&#34;, she has the culture and attitudes spot on.
B000002H97|3|This is not a bad Album, per say, but it's an album that put Metallica on the Radio, anf for true Metallica fans it wasn't what was expected after their previous 4 albums. There are some good songs on there, but I've heard much better music before. A must have for all Metallica hard core fans of their new era, but don't bother otherwise
B00AEBB9V4|5|Wonderful movie'
1609614798|5|Awesome book.  This is why I became a health coach!  I have much work to do.<br />If you want to get and stay healthy and help other to do the same, then buy this book for everyone you care about!<br />Read it.  Study it.  Share it!
0743486285|5|This book is NOT a 'pity party'. To me this book is not saying 'poor me', its to overcome inner pain, a disease, claw back into the world with the dream of helping others. This book is a kick in the pants of life. It is a truthful look into not only the life of a rock star, but also the life of someone with an heroin addiction. The book has every emotion written into one book. As one begins to read the book, you realize the book its self is now your addiction to finish reading it. I love the book, the message, and Nikki.
B0018QQQKS|5|Great in depth look into the mysteries surrounding money!  A must read if you are in the financial world.  If you are not it is still educational.
B005NF2UE6|5|Great album, but I love Nickleback!  I receive this CD as a gift for Christmas, and I have not stopped listening to it since then.  I loaded it on my Iphone so I can listen to it at work or where ever, and I have the CD in my car.  I would recommend it, but again I like Nickleback!
B0047WJ12K|5|Great movie. Loved it!!!
B00H58VGIA|5|I found this book very inspiring.  It really tugged at my heart.  Our country has come a long way, but still struggling with the racism issues.  We are all equal in God's eyes!
B00N1HONIO|4|The pc is defiantly better but that's to be expected. Overall  the port is great and if you are a big fan of the original release then this is a good app to own.
B000XR4OC0|3|\\"One-for-one,\\" I like that phrase but is the shoe really worth it?  A year ago I bought my first pair of Toms.  My first pair of Toms was the classic black slip-on and they cost $47.80.  After paying this amount for these shoes I don't agree that the price for these shoes is appropriate. They should be priced at $10.  I definitely didn't hesitate to buy these shoes because Toms donates a pair of shoes when you buy a pair of shoes, so who wouldn't buy these shoes, right?  That was my mistake. I better off donating money for food than these shoes.<br /> Bobs are better quality and they last longer, my sisters shoes have lasted longer than my newer Toms. Toms are too expensive for a shoe that falls apart on the first month. There is a hole where my big toe is, the back of the shoe is undone and ripped already, and the sole of the shoe is ridiculously poor quality. The sole of the shoe is the worst part of the shoe.  It is so thin and smooth that causes slips and falls all the time, well at least to me. They should never be worn on rainy days!  Apart from the sole, the quality itself sucks. The shoe fades within the first 5 months; I washed mine because the inside of the shoe started to smell and the shoes faded form black to dark gray.  The inside of the shoe starts to smell if regular socks aren't worn or even athleta flat socks. It's really bad.<br />  On the other, Toms are very comfortable and stylish. They pretty much go with everything casual. You can wear them with a plain t-shirt and pants or even to a formal event like a wedding.  That's kind of a trend now a day. I wore mine black glittery Toms to prom like many that night and my feet were very satisfied.  Plus, Toms go with any gender, age, and style.  After a workout, Toms are very cozy to wear.  After all they are very lightweight.<br /> If you just want a causal pair of shoes (not to be worn on wet surfaces or used for anything else other than walking) then they are fair shoes. If you are a mom looking for a sturdy and durable pair of shoes for your child that will last at least a school year, you are better off buying a pair of shoes at Payless.  However, I am not saying you shouldn't buy these shoes; I am simply going off by my own experience, my friends and family. Think twice before you buy and go to a store first to check them out, and then make your decision about getting them.<br /><br />K.

B00GK65HWE|5|we loved the first one & this one didn't disappoint  either. all the fantastic fantasy creatures & graphics are awesome/ cant wait for three
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|I really like this game, and the best part are the limit time challenges, those are great, I invest 3 dollar's to support the game Developers, they eat too.
B00DVKOYBM|1|I swear that there are hackers that cheat at this game. Way to many times I have balls dropped and the game says I ran out of time. I call bull-s***.
B00BEIYP8A|5|I saw the film and I love it. But I've got a question. In the languages say the film is in Spanish and English. The Spanish is from Mexico or from Europe's Spain?
B00VFTCGES|5|Awesome  wow.
1439102813|3|A good novel, but not compelling. I learned alot about Alzheimer's disease while reading this book. Luckily, I understood many of those medical terms only because of nursing school. I imagine someone that is not in the medical field would probably have a difficult time with it. I was wishing that the author would have focused more on \\"fiction\\" and the storyline rather than the scientific part of it, but I guess with her background science is her expertise. After reading this book I have a couple of unanswered questions like..Why did John and Alice ride through the cemetery on that snowy day? Was John wanting her to choose a plot to be buried? Why was John so determined to move to New York? In one part of the story John's grown children were begging him to stay and John said, \\"I haven't come to a final decision yet, and the two of you aren't going to bully me into one. You know don't everything.\\" Well, this left me curious and I kept waiting for John to reveal something important that the his children did not know, but he never did. One of the good parts of the story that I liked was the way Alice and Lydia(her daughter) became closer as the story went on. I began to like all of the characters but, John was my least favorite. He seemd a bit insensitive but maybe this is how some family members become when a loved one has Alzheimer's disease.
B0000DIXDR|5|Awesome!
B00992CF6W|4|sweet sweet sweet love it it it I plat it every day so cool I have so much fun so cool
B001E9641K|4|Good option for fewer players. This game is only for 2 or 3 players so it is a good alternative to the other versions.
B00LYXV66O|4|Enjoyed the five book series. Hope there will be another one

B002RRWWQ4|5|Another awesome Harry Potter movie!  This one sure has a completely unexpected plot twist.  Kept me on the edge of my seat every minute.  Hold on to your popcorn!
B008JFUPK8|3|There are some things to be liked in this new cinematic version of Superman. Despite its darker take on the comic legend, there are some nice heartfelt moments from his formative years in Smallville and some well-observed mythic overtones as Clark Kent realizes his true destiny. Amy Adams makes a great, savvy Lois Lane, and Henry Cavill certainly has the look of a Man of Steel.<br /><br />But as a movie and entertainment vehicle, this fell way short of the 1978 Christopher Reeve picture. That movie really delivered the goods, with its sweeping Lois Lane romance around the skies of Metropolis, laughably maniacal Lex Luther and bumbling Otis and Superman in top form, amazing city crowds and saving everyone in sight.<br /><br />What we have in the climax of the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is a mind-numbing, prolonged slug fest between Superman and General Zod that reduces Metropolis to rubble. And this is not an Earth-created conflict, but one that Superman's father created by sending his son to our doorstep. I thought Superman was supposed to help humanity -- not create more problems!<br /><br />When you leave a Superman movie wishing that Jor-El had picked a different planet for his son's nursery, you know something has gone wrong.
B001KVZ6HK|5|Donde vayas puedes verla, en tu pc, DVD y blu ray una gran aventura en defensa de la tierra. Y a los ni&ntilde;os les encanta!!!!
0385510438|3|When I picked up the book, I was expecting a legal thriller like so many of Grisham's previous books. This is not a legal thriller. Actually the main focus on this story isn't about the trial but about the main character's friendship with one of the jurors. It's not a bad book...but if you were looking for a legal thriller...this wasn't it. Wait for paperback if you really feel like buying the book.
B009ZFPQOQ|5|Amazing. Uses a lot of battery.
B008RTE09S|5|Yes, the movie is cheaply made and amateurish, but I really don't care, because spliced in between the poor \\"acting,\\" silly scenes, blurry photography etc is the pure magic of seeing the Beatles performing some of the greatest music ever written. When, the songs start, my heart still jumps, and I forget about the filler in between. In all fairness, this was an experiment for the Beatles; if the cinematic part of the experiment failed, what matters is that the music succeeded beyond all.
B00FAX6XQC|4|I really like this game you will like it too if you like hunting in real life (though it is better in real life) but this game is awesome and I like the graphics but the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is kinda confusing because I played the first one before this one but you will get the hang of it
B00CWV8X04|4|A A A +. It will keep you interested. The end is great, my wife and daughter enjoy it very much.
B0013TXA5Y|4|Good adventure with supernatural beings.  I found it hard to put down.  Am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This book by this author has prompted me to do something I said I probably would not do once I realized you were able to leave a review of what you read. Normally I would stay away from genres like this because of the content but I have to say it was so well written and put together that I  could not stop reading even after I realized what the storyline was about. I highly recommend this book if you want emotion,love, real life,and Hope. I am writing this review with the hope that you will read for yourself and feel what Colleen Hoover brings to life with  all the characters. NO CLIFFHANGERS. It definitely belongs on the bestsellers. Read it, you won't regret this purchase.
B00EEDJHXA|5|Challenging... cute... can't put it down. Love this game!!!!!!!!!! Great game play... makes you think... great for ALL ages.  A great time waster... or just to fill in a few boring minutes
B00NG6FMOE|5|Excellent music and DVD.
0307730697|5|Amazing! So touching. Glad the world has people like him in it!
B004MC8CA2|4|It's a very good application.  I highly recommend it.  I love the bible plans that are easily accessible.  As for the personal information that the application may ask of you, you do have the choice of either accepting or denying access to your personal information.
B00BDAP66E|3|it's dandy!  fricken fantastic!  weird &amp; wonerful! what else am I supposed to say?  you keep telling me I have this new message, and won't go away till I write a damnable review!  well, there!  now go away and let me use the damnable page please!
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Very good, makes you think a lot as do many of Jodi's books. I am now a huge fan. Waiting for the new one in October, 2014!
B0007OASII|5|First off, as a singer myself, I had to laugh at the user who commented that Khan has a bad voice; they must not sing. <br /> <br />Now onto the ratings.  In the past, I admit it, I'd listen to Kamelot for Roy Khan's awesome vocals.  I then got a hold of this album and realized for the metal idiom, it is a very very good album.  I very much enjoyed all the songs on this album and would recommend it to anybody who's not afraid to listen to some metal.
B001EBV0OY|5|Powerful
B009IEXKXI|5|Além de ser um dos melhores livros que li nos últimos anos, há passagens engraçadíssimas. Eu realmente gostaria de ler outros livros do Andy Weir. Recomendo.

1401201911|5|what this book did was incredible. set the landing of Kal-El in Mother Russia, and you have a great twist of a beloved American icon. any Superman fan that hasnt read this, should.
0525953728|4|This is the story of Mark Owen (not real name).  Not JUST the incident that happened concerning Osama Bin Laden, but excerpts from his military career.  Mark Owen does a good job of using &#34;laymen&#34; terms and keeping the story simple enough for enough non-military personnel to read.  Too often I have read military novels and realized that they were meant for only the military community to understand.  Mark Owen does a good job of making military equipment and action events easy for the average reader to understand.  I highly recommend this book for any looking for a good military action novel.
B00JB3MVCW|1|Oh there is so much to dislike, but won't waste the words.  It is not even worthy of them.
B003UESJHY|5|Wish I could give this a million stars.  One of Mark Wahlberg's absolute best movies.
B00BUI5GW8|5|I rate this album 5 stars because he has songs with with &#34;Old Wayne&#34; in it.. VS the Post Rikers Island Wayne... I like Days and Days, No Worries, Rich as F***, Gun Walk, Wowzers (love it), Love me, Trigger Finger, and Trippy (fun)
B007SGM084|5|Amazing!  I was disappointed with the 3rd book though.  There was  too much time jumping and not enough detail for me.
B0091REZMW|1|Didn't work for me.
B0074Y2YZ4|3|There were a couple of good songs. Per Gessle is one of my favorite artists but his latest stuff isn't as good as what he used to produce.
B009UAO1ZG|5|One of the most interesting and enlightening books I have ever read.  What comes around goes around.
B000PC0S5K|5|Fantastic read. It definitely is an addition to the power of now but with an emphasis on the singular consciousness vs global and how they are the same. Therefor for a global shift to occur (which it must) an internal shift of 'self'' must occur first
159315724X|3|It is a rather dull approach to a basic approach.  there were a couple of examples which were interesting and probably effective
B00PM3SKNY|3|It doesn't have all the colors you need  and I'm writing a book. There's just not enough text for a book.
B00GT67UUM|5|Great graphics and sound. The animation is fun to watch. Educational too , in regard to gears .and piping and possibly more.
B000Z27HLS|4|I love Jane Austen.  This version of Northlanger Abbey is pretty good. The villians are easy to dislike for sure.
B00632HWOG|4|works fine
B00005R2M3|4|I did not like this album after the first time I listened. However, the second and the third time - well, it kind of grows on you! <BR>Songs are not monotone or same as everything else out there. <BR>I believe this is a good buy and would recommend it. <BR>Also recommend &quot;ESCAPE&quot; if you're buying this album.
0743496736|5|As a school teacher, I was very interested in how bullying can really play out in a student's life. This was a great book! I never wanted to put it down!
B00EOARZ4G|5|Such a shame that he is gone.  His writing's were always so timely (consider this book and the current situation in the Ukraine!) and non-stop excitement.  I'm going to truly miss his books.  This one is a must read!
B00335EQ0E|4|Classic and a bit strange but my 3 year old loves the movie and the product was in perfect condition.
1451624468|5|A first class call to rethink your views on eternity; a must read.
B00P7PJ9P0|5|Thoroughly enjoyable take on the Sleeping Beauty story!  Superb acting and special effects; spot on family entertainment.  Looking forward to owning it to watch again and again.
B000002GFC|5|It's sing-along time again!
B009ZQJ1G4|5|Lots of twist and unpredictable.  My kinda movie. Had never seen or heard of this movie but was glad that I chose it
B00005JLKB|5|Smallville is the best superhero show ever put on television and is one of the best TV shows on right now.  The writing is superb and the acting is wondeful.  Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor is the real star of the show.  he's perfect.  He gives Lex so many layers it's absolutely amazing.    From the start of the Pilot to the end of Tempest you'll love this show.  It's definitely one of the best.  My favorite show on TV right now.    Some of the best from the season include: Pilot, Hourglass, X-Ray, Rogue, Zero, Stray, Nicodemus, and Tempest.    Highly recommended.
0553050613|4|Mark wrote about what the street smart manager should do instead of following the work taught in business school.<br />He teach you about making impression, sales technique and negotiation skill, which I think, the business school hardly ever  taught its students.<br />I learn alot from the book.
B00NWDP6P6|5|It's a nice app. I just think that its always saying clear history I don't like that.
B003VVFGWC|5|LOVE!
B00GMBQMIK|4|More solid music from SM & the Jicks.
0345803485|5|I'm a business graduate student who never gets wrapped up in fictional books. I mainly read informational text, articles, educational textbooks, ect. But my sorority went crazy over this book and insisted I read it. I ordered it since I'm not no longer working as I enjoy my first pregnanct, and I CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. It's against my style, but yet I'm in love with the book. I will soon be ordering the other two! And the condition of the book was PERFECT.
B00F87ZUYG|3|Season 1 still got me watching and still watching cos amazons is awesome, stop watching tv but paying to watch this show;)
0887431453|5|My grandson love it
1594744769|5|Loved this book! Loved the old eccentric photos as well as the story.  It could be the next equivalent to a \\"Harry Potter\\" sort of series if Riggs is able to keep it up,and if you read it, you will WANT him to keep it up!!!  It's a bit dark and yet has a redeeming sort of light contained within it and an interesting basic premise.  Suitable for teens to adults.  I feel as if I have only just met the characters (peculiar children) within and hope more of their back stories will be revealed in the future!  The photos were gleaned from yard sales and the like and fit well within the story.  The visuals add to the interesting tone of the book.  I am hanging onto my copy and hope that soon, there will be a sequel for me to love as much as I enjoyed this book!
B009MF56GC|4|Ok so I thought the first one was ok but it could have been much better... this one is much more likable more action better story and the humor worked much better in this one. Still haven't seen the 3rd buy the fact that it's PG 13... idk!!!
B00QXKB7X0|4|bought as a gift
1932073221|5|Easy read, inspiring and logical. It talks about the power of our thoughts but also our actions. Suggests getting totally organized with your finances (Which I am, thank God! Took me a moment though.) So, it is new age-y but highly practical.
B00IG2DOKM|5|I could spend days writing about how great this app/game is, but I could never do it justice. So, here's the condensed version: According to my Kindle log, I've spent more time playing this game than any other - which exceeds 80 hours. One might think that isn't a good use of time, but because I spend the majority of my time in a hospital, it's a great way to occupy my time. However, I spent significant time playing before I became  trapped in a hospital bed. This game has depth; requires planning, patience and creativity; has timely and appropriate updates; has great graphics; multiple moving parts, and all must be monitored for maximum fun and reward within the game. In-app purchasing is reasonable and you get value for your hard- earned money. For those of you who were around when SimCity was new and almost the only game out there for your PC, you'll understand this game. If you love the concept of a &amp;#34;Simulation&amp;#34;, this game is for you. Try it...you won't be sorry.
B005GFPZYK|4|A good read for the holidays, though it can be a bit hard to wade through from time to time. An honest telling of his story.
B00BU18U82|2|Trey Hackett
B00E5I2ME0|5|Awesome movie
B00192KCQ0|4|Mostly excellent tunes...Cyanide and My Apocalypse are instant classics.  While Suicide and Redemption is good it's way too long for an instrumental.  As a whole I listen to the album straight through skipping in the middle of maybe two songs.  If you're a Metallica fan you'll enjoy this.
B00005JLTN|5|i admit it's nothing compared to the original but it still is allot of fun special effects filled action. it is a great movie but it's not as good as the first.
B00FAPF5U0|5|So I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.....Passes the time when I'm sick......really enjoy the continuous challenges.....such a brain game. Keeps me thinking and engaged.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I found myself wanting to skip forward for the first time in my life because I wasn't sure if I could wait to find out what was in Jon-Paul's letter that he didn't expect to be found until after his death (though the letter was found by his wife while he was out of town).  There are many stories within this story, and it was interesting how interconnected the lives were, and how so many little things changed the course of their collective histories over time.  I thought Moriarity did a good job depicting how people can be misunderstood, as well as misunderstand others BECAUSE they don't know their backgrounds, or won't open their eyes to see.
0375703764|1|I have nothing to say about this book except that it's pretentious and half the pages are blank.  i feel like i bought brian griffin's \\"wish it, want it, do it\\"...

B000002J0B|5|At one point, Houses of the Holy was my favorite Zeppelin album.  Although Physical Graffiti has recently edged out that distinction, Houses of the Holy will always have a special place in my heart.  What it comes down to may be the fact that Houses of the Holy is one of their most accessible albums, yet is trailblazing at the same time.  While Led Zeppelin III and IV may have been somewhat murky-sounding at times, and challenging to listen to at first, Houses of the Holy is bright in both production and general attitude.  The darkest-sounding song here is \\"No Quarter\\", with its mix of psychedelic keyboards and low-key doomy vibe; yet even this song manages to avoid being oppressive.  The opening \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is relentlessly open-sounding and driving, and, in my opinion, may have had some influence on U2's open-plains, echoing hopefulness (it doesn't hurt that U2 themselves have admitted a tad of Zeppelin's influence for at least a couple of their songs), while its sister piece, \\"The Rain Song\\", channels orchestral prog-rock influences.  In addition to channeling funk (\\"The Crunge\\") and reggae (\\"D'Yer Maker\\"), the band electrifies South Asian influences (some of the micro-tonal South Asian influences in \\"Dancing Days\\") and creates straight-forward commercial hard rock with \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\".  To top it off, the album closes with one of the band's best songs, the relentless positive \\"The Ocean\\", which ends with a guitar rave-up backed by doo-wop vocals.  Physical Graffiti's sheer variety and scope may give that album the edge at the end of the day, but Houses of the Holy deserves recognition for providing a fantastic, energized introduction to the uninitiated as to why Led Zeppelin is so well-loved.

1400052173|4|Right now I am 3/4 of the way through this book and can't put it down but I keep thinking that it probably would not have been written if the doctor who had worked with these cells had given them a different name besides \\"HeLa\\", the first two letters of the original donor's first and last names.  Like, what if he gave the cells a number with letters from HIS first and last names, or just some other random combination of letters and numbers, e.g. something involving the month, year and some random letters. BE THIS A LESSON TO RESEARCHERS -- if you are working with human cells and have to give them a name, DO NOT give one that in the LEAST resembles the name of the original donor.    The cells that this entire book is about were from a particularly agressive cervical cancer taken from a black woman named Henrietta Lacks, a cervical cancer probably caused by HPV virus (genital wart virus) given to her by her philandering husband, a husband who was a cousin that she married after he got her pregnant.  She then had several more children with him, one of whom she carried while she had the beginning stages of this cancer.  She died when this last child was a baby.  Her five children were basically orphaned because their father gave them to some other relatives to raise, or, more accurately, to neglect and abuse.  The book focuses on the life stories of these unfortunate children, their offspring, and other Lacks' relatives, both white and black.  The author spent a lot of her time and energy pursuing and the interviewing Henrietta's daughter Deborah, a woman prone to histrionics, whose understanding of modern science is quite insignificant.  She actually believed that the HeLa cancer cells could be used to make clones of her mother.      As I said, I am 3/4 of the way through and have found the descriptions of the contributions of HeLa cells to modern cytology and epidemiology fascinating -- they have been used to develop polio and HPV vaccines, among others.  I am gettingvery tired of all the Lacks' family drama, their insistence that their mother's cells were \\"stolen\\" and that because money has been made from them, they should be entitled to some of it.  OK, like many poor Americans, their lives were difficult and unfortunate and filled with tragedy and suffering, but other people like them have had similar lives and have chosen to rise above them.  Henrietta had a horrible death at a very young age, but as cancer treatment was in its infancy in those days, there was not that much that could be done with a disease such as hers for both rich and poor.  Her cells are being used to helped develop cures for diseases.  This is a legacy that she did not consciously choose, nor did any of her descendants help to promote.  Occasionally they seem to glimpse the importance of this, but not often.
B000QRIGLC|4|A hard story to read. These guys do things we mortals can't start to understand and that's just the first week of training. The battle of Murphys Ridge is almost to painful to read but the rescue by the locals helped heal the pain. I hope all those local people who stuck to an ancient code of honor the likes of which is lost on most of us are safe and living their lives happily. They to are heroes.

B00127RAJY|5|I got this dvd as me and a group of friends are doing a 4 week weightloss challenge and as I'm a mom of 2 so the 20 minute intensive workout idea appealed to me as finding time to work out with 2 toddlers is nigh on impossible.  I am a total couch potato lol so this was quite a shock to the system. I am 5ft 8 and started this dvd at 184lb. I am on day 5....haven't weighed in yet so I don't know if I have lost weight but i can tell you that i feel much better about myself. I can feel my body toning up. I honestly see a difference in my body in only a few days.  This dvd will push you. My whole body ACHED for the first couple of days. I honestly don't think there is a part of your body Jillian doesn't work out. I would highly recommend. I think it's a fun challenge...it's only for 30 days...I think I an can do it and if i can do it I think most other beginners could too. Love it!

B00EEL0LGY|4|Great game play and graphics,  4 stars because it has been crashing lately but I'm sure the developer's will sort that out soon, 5 if they do sort it out, because its one of the best games of its kind on the market at the moment, its a fun and really enjoyable game, its also a game that you can't just breeze through on your first go, its a game with a real challenge factor to it, you have to build up your vehicle to make it more competitive, which i like. id highly recommend this game to all who enjoy a great well put together racing game.

B000005H7D|5|John Coltrane was a monster of the tenor sax as early as 1955, when he first joined Miles Davis' band.  An overachiever, Coltrane had a relentless and unvarying passion for practice, for improving his skills as an artist.  As he progressed through his quite legendary career, he never ceased to amaze.<br />BLUE TRAIN (1957) is a classic; an album often heralded as one of the greatest records of the 1950s by fans and jazz educators alike.  It gives the listener a very clear view of what made these musicians so great.  You will notice things like Coltrane's (and pianist Kenny Drew's) tasteful and masterful usage of the blues scale in the chant-like title cut.  Many musicians have the tendency to drive that scale into the ground when playing the blues.  Not so here: these guys were well beyond that sort of thing.  On Jerome Kern's &quot;I'm Old Fashioned,&quot; you will hear Coltrane's (or was it Kenny Drew's?) ascending-stepwise reharmonization.  The Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller solos on &quot;Locomotion&quot; are a delight, but that's true of the entire album.<br />It is well known that the Coltrane composition &quot;Giant Steps&quot; (released in 1959) is a bear to play, to improvise on the changes.  But, even here, Coltrane was writing tunes that could shake a few people up.  &quot;Moment's Notice&quot; is one such tune.  It has an ABAC structure (8 bars, 8 bars, 8 bars, 14 bars: a total of 38 bars for one time through)--hard enough to follow--along with a barrage of formidable chord changes.  Some say the song got its name when Curtis Fuller asked, &quot;You expect me to play these changes at a moment's notice?&quot;<br />BLUE TRAIN is certainly deserving of being hailed as a &quot;classic,&quot; a term grossly overused these days.  Imagination or creativity doesn't always come in the form of extreme busyness, and if you give this album your full attention, it will offer riches galore.  There is good reason why BLUE TRAIN is listed on many a jazz educator's essential recordings list:  It IS essential.  (Seeing that this reissue gives you all the bonus extras for just a few bucks more, I can't see going for the earlier one.)<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayal recordings list:  It IS essential.

0385344333|2|I was really looking forward to this book.  Like a great many other reviewers, I thought that this book didn't do the Reacher series justice.<br /><br />The story is not all that compelling, there's nothing new here, and I got tired of reading pages of boring landscape descriptions.<br /><br />It was also hard to get drawn into the story because the story nemesis was never really developed making it hard for me to really care about the outcome.<br /><br />If you haven't read all of the Reacher books this definitely is not the one to read.  The others are all really good.<br /><br />A Wanted Man isn't a really bad book - it just doesn't compare well with the past books in the series.

Mr. Lewis' portrayal of this down to earth, earnest, passionate and very intelligent and wily man who became the President was excellent.  The book this is based on gives you more about his entire cabinet, but this movie is ALL about Lincoln as President, as a man and as a husband and father.  Truly enlightening.

B0012K1ILW|5|The great philosopher Dr. Cornel West has written and lectured extensively on the Blue Note. The Blue Note is that \\"note of dissonance and defiance\\" \\"that people of African descent interjected into American history,\\" he told an audience at the University of Virginia. The Blue Note is the note of \\"questioning but also connecting with others, trying to situate oneself in a story bigger than oneself. Trying to locate oneself in a narrative grander than oneself. But deeply grounded in the best of a democratic tradition that says that every day people's lives have dignity, that lives are shot through with a sense of the problematic and majestic and the tragic, and that they ought to have a voice\\" Erykah Badu gives form to that voice with songs that embody the Blue Note on her fourth album, New Amerykah. The album contains songs at once vulnerable and urgent accompanied by imagery that is arresting. The result is an album that is as uncompromising as Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On and as candid as Curtis Mayfield's Superfly featuring songs that evoke the agitation of Marvin Gaye's \\"Inner City Blues,\\" the audacity of Parliament's \\"Chocolate City,\\" and the lucidity of Prince's \\"Sign O'the Times.\\" Yet Badu is assuredly original. Although she channels the spirits of the aforementioned artists, the songs on New Amerykah stand solidly on their own.<br /><br />Badu sets the tone for the album on \\"Amerykahn Promise,\\" a song that mocks America's obsession with vengeance, materialism, and physical perfection. If \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" sounds like the opening of a 70s Blaxploitation film it may be because it was produced by jazz-funk legend Roy Ayers who also produced the soundtrack to Pam Grier's Coffy. Then, on \\"The Healer\\", Badu declares that Hip Hop is an unstoppable, transcendental lifeforce that is bigger than religion and the government. On the introspective \\"Me,\\" Badu pushes back against the same forces mentioned in \\"The Healer\\" that wish Black people would disappear and promises that \\"they may try to erase my face but millions will spring up in my place.\\" On the same track she forthrightly acknowledges the public's fascination with her private life as she sings about her children's fathers (Andre Benjamin of Outkast and rapper The D.O.C.) and affirms her right to live as she pleases. She later hails the controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on the song, holding him up as an example of someone who like her is misunderstood. On \\"My People\\" Badu uses former Temptation Eddie Kendricks' 1972 desperate plea \\"My People Hold On\\" to encourage perseverance. This is followed by \\"Soldier,\\" a song both uplifting and despairing in its depiction of a young man striving to succeed even as he is surrounded by violence and criminality. Badu is relentless as she calls out warring people in Iraq, corrupt elected officials in Washington, DC, and corrupt cops everywhere. She boldly frames 9/11 as America's wake up call and pledges kinship with the victims of America's negligence who suffered during Hurricane Katrina. Once again, she protests against a power structure that is in denial \\"tryin' to hide the history but they know who we are.\\"<br /><br />Badu does not shy away from confronting those she is advocating for. \\"We're not well, she sings on \\"The Cell\\" conveying both anguish and anger at the endless cycle of pain, addiction, violence, and exploitation that grips families. On \\"Twinkle\\" she rails against the subjugation inherent in ghetto life where the only choices for escape are prison or addiction. She lays the blame for this existence on those in power who keep families \\"uneducated, sick, and depressed.\\" At the same time, she calls for an end to the complacency that allows people to just \\"take what their given.\\" Instead, she calls on people to \\"struggle and strive\\" (`Master Teacher\\") and elevate themselves above despair and addiction (\\"That Hump\\").<br /><br />New Amerykah's penultimate song is the despondent \\"Telephone,\\" a song forher friend and producer J. Dilla who died in 2006. On the song she asks Dilla to prepare a place for her - a plea that goes beyond a wish to be reunited in death with a loved one. Badu sees death as the ultimate escape from the world of pain and desolation she sees engulfing her community everyday. Yet she clearly does not feel death is the only way out. Badu is very fond of the Ankh which symbolizes water, air, the sun and the power to give life. With New Amerykah she boldly asserts that the power to give life resides within each individual regardless of their circumstances and challenges listeners to recognize and use this power to speak truth to power. New Amerykah shows Badu at perhaps the height of her own power as both poet and prophet - something quite refreshing in an age of \\"Idol\\" worship.(March 1, 2008)J. Dilla who died in 2006.

080012166X|5|Personally, I hated the novel and hoped to see the film was done a lot better. Coppolla really did add some good touches to the novel, as well cast some unforgettable actors.  Gary Oldman is the master as Dracula, who really makes you cry and fear him.  Ryder is pretty good, though I have disliked some other stuff she's done.  The other supporting cast in incredible, making the story seem real and alive.      Probably one of the best things about the film, despite the nudity, was the soundtrack by Wojeich Kilar.  Some songs are scary enough not to listen to at night, but grab you and make you visualize the images of the film.  It deserved the 3 Oscars it won, though Oldman should've gotten a reward for his stunning performance.  This is the vampire film all fans should own, or at least see once in their lifetime, because is this is what immortal love is all about.
B004SIP7TE|4|While a reality check would show this to be more Hollywood than not, the movie is a good movie and it's JUST a movie.<br /><br />The story is the story of the Five Points of New York and the numerous and various gangs who not only live but run the place.  Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job conveying the feeling of the people.  However, it's Daniel Day Defoe that makes this movie the stellar movie that it is.<br /><br />Defoe, playing Bill the Butcher, runs the \\"Natives\\" the group who believes immigrants are the bane of the country.  All \\"native-born\\" men are to be honored as the saviors of the Five Points.  Bill wants to make sure the Natives are stronger than any other group.<br /><br />This is a long and sometimes convoluted movie, but it certainly is worth watching, not just once, but several times.

B000OVLINI|5|This was one of the better written books that I've read in awhile - beautiful descriptions without feeling tedious, a fascinating story that gets more complex with each chapter, but brilliantly. I really enjoyed this book which seemed to offer a little bit of everything - it is really a mammoth of a story, where Zafon takes his time to tell seemingly every story and quaint thought he's ever had, but somehow managed to do it brilliantly, in my opinion. You get a little bit of everything here - gothic, dark descriptions, a massive cast of characters, each with their own secrets and stories - the book is peppered with life lessons and ruminations, ridiculous humor, heart breaking turns of events and moments of hope in the middle of despair. I found it gritty and depressing and yet breath taking and filled with a sense that \\"maybe things can still work out\\" even when it seems unlikely, or even impossible.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Great book - until the end, at which time you will CRY.  Each character's point of view is clear - Riordan writes to show each of his character's personalities, and you can tell they are different - he really brings their voices out.

0446585041|3|From the very first story, Cover Girl, I got the impression that I was reading ideas and thoughts that were clever and well-meaning, but not very funny.  Then I started imagining Ellen delivering those lines: a short pause at the right moment, an inflection of the voice when needed, and her low-key, deadpan delivery that is so unique.  All of a sudden, the book got a lot funnier.  Of course, it was tiring and impractical to keep that up throughout the book.<br /><br />I guess the listen here is that stand-up comedy must be heard not read.  Without the comic's delivery, we're left with anecdotes that are rather wise and somewhat entertaining, but not very funny.  Still, there is enough insight and amusement to recommend the book.  Just don't expect to be doubling over with laughter.
0792842103|2|I can't believe people calling this movie 70's-like; it's just as fast as any of the newer Bond movies. And that's precisely why I was disappointed  by it being so &quot;current&quot;, after all. After reading all these  great things about it - pre-MTV, slow pace, the setting, downbeat ending,  talky, etc. - I thought here might finally be a movie different from the  bulk of recent action flicks. But no. Sure, the colors are subdued and they  may talk a lot, but here's where the misunderstanding begins. Just 'cos  they talk more (which in retrospect, I'm not even sure they do all THAT  much), doesn't necessarily mean it's a slow movie. -There's one vital thing  which distinguish the 70's from the 90's: the editing. The makers of  &quot;Ronin&quot; just didn't dare to slow that down, I guess. -In fear  modern audiences might fall asleep, no doubt. How very boring.

B00TZE3W0C|4|Joey Alexander is phenomenal, in the real sense. He is a musical phenomenon, and has been recognized as such. As a self taught pianist, who as a child of 11 living in Indonesia,which is not exactly a hotbed of jazz, and whose repertoire is not from the Louis Armstrong of his parents, he is almost unbelievable, but hearing is believing. His technique is excellent, and his understanding of chords and improvisation astounding. It is reasonable to assume that all this is the result of not only listening but of hearing. This CD should be owned, not only because it is great to listen to,but because time will prove it to be an historic recording, one way or another. Then why only four stars? Because listening to it and not taking into account all that I have just said, and reviewing it as the work of an accomplished and mature jazz musician, it falls short. Throughout the disc his style is virtuosic and florid. He rarely if ever indulges in playing in a laid back swinging style. It is as if he is devoting the disc to a display of his incredible ability, like a calling card for his future. This rush of notes is understandable, coming from one so young, but I feel the adults in his production and management team, should have exerted some influence over the final product. But one thing is for sure. Joey Alexander will be making more CDs and it is to be hoped that by then he may have developed some of the restraint of the pianists he idolizes.

B00FVVR2ZO|4|It just feels like that when you are playing it seems unfair that you are almost  definitely not going to achieve what you would like to WITHOUT in game purchases...that sounds like you have NO chance to achieve your goal without in game purchases...NOT doing so leaves an unfairly unbiased game play if you don't pony up some $$... other than that it is a nicely made game that is very challenging at times and frustrated at others but still keeps you on your toes because of the way the strategy of the game... I think ALL the ghostly driven characters are just a little too much of a challenge... that is my opinion.
B00TYBD6VQ|2|A study of how to be an arrogant bully in the name of &#34;teaching&#34; drumming to absolute perfection to an already gifted music student.  The repetitiveness of the bullying rises to the level of absurdity.  Nobody benefits from any &#34;teacher&#34; who tries to intimidate a student like this one does.  Oscar winning performance?  Maybe, if the &#34;over the top&#34; dialogue and physical shenanigans of character actor, J.K. Simmons, are to be admired.  A supporting actor well overdue for the big time?  Maybe, but his role in humorous commercial TV spots may well be just as  memorable.
B00ESB75FA|4|Life Changing!
B002VECM6S|5|This has become one of my favorite family-friendly movies. It has a good and uplifiting story line. The DVD quality was perfect.
B00003ZKSP|5|Slipknot is, if not the best, one of the best bands I have ever seen or  heard.  There was a lot of hype about them at my school, so I bought the  album, I was skeptical at first... but Slipknot rocks! If your style of  music is rock, punk, rap, hardcore, WHATEVER, you'll love this band!!  JUST  BUY THE ALBUM!
B00CW6DAKC|2|Where is it? It won't let me play until I update, but there isn't an update in the Amazon app store. Please fix this so I can continue enjoying this game. (Star rating will change when update available)
B000FC1HBY|5|Love this series...Martin is a genius!
B004SF30HI|5|This soundtrack is full of music and artists that I enjoy, from Bossa Nova to Taio Cruz, to a lovely song by Jamie Foxx. Very upbeat and dance-able! And a steal at 5 bucks - I intended to get just one song, but got the whole album. Very satisfied with this purchase : )
B005HEPS6A|4|I enjoyed  3 season very much.  Well written, good characters and story line.  It is a pleasure to watch a show with a  language that is not an embarrssment.
B0013TXA5Y|5|This is my kind of book.  I am looking forward to the movie in August.  So far city of ash is just as good.
B00BTYP6QE|5|Great app!
B006MHWXMS|5|Excellent product! Feature rich with plenty of flexibility. It's the only app I use need for work, personal, etc. User interface is hands down the best!
B0058YPGVQ|5|got this movie for my daughters for Christmas to finish their collection. The each have part of the collection and share. Great shape and they love it
B00992CF6W|4|I love this game so much. If you want to see what minecraft is like before buying it on your PC, get this. I play this all the time and its addicting. Just wish the update for 0.7.2 would come out. PLEASE AMAZON UPDATE PLEASE!!!
B009UX2YAC|5|Wow this game is the best better than temple run this is a sucsess
0307712508|5|Eye opener
B00KNWYDU8|5|Just got started but love this game already !  I am looking forward to breeding more dragons.
B005LAIH2M|5|I dislike Jeremy Renner as an actor. I wish he was replaced and maybe I'd definitely, completely enjoy it. Even though he was given the crucial part int he movie, he made it just fine. The movie is really, really awesome. Nice special effects, amazing plot. The movie is nearly amazing! I will watch it again with big pleasure! I wish there were more movies like this one!
B00DJWV11I|3|This was an easy read. I enjoyed the mystery of the plot. I would recommended this book to my friends  and daughter.
6304698798|4|What a difference between FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY in Sergio Leone's career. It's the difference between the movie of an average director who has some good ideas to renew an old dying genre, the Western, and the movie of an authentic author-director able to present  a 3 hours long story without annoying his audience.<br />You will find in THE  GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY the germs of Leone's three last movies and,  already, some references to his precedents films like Ennio Morricone's  musical score during the final duel, about ten seconds of the clock music  heard in A FEW DOLLARS MORE.<br />The opening sequence of THE GOOD, THE BAD  AND THE UGLY is terrific : a man is waiting for what it seems to be his  duel adversaries and the music, the cinematography make us believe that we  will admire a pure Sergio Leone's duel when the director finally decides to  change his mind and to refuse us the duel we have waited for. That is pure  cinema, a pleasure no other art is able to give us.<br />One of the aspect  announcing ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is the use of Ennio Morricone's  music. More lyrical, the notes follow the director's long travellings and  give another dimension to certain scenes. When image and sound meet and  match perfectly, it's one of the sign of a great movie.<br />THE GOOD, THE BAD  AND THE UGLY is not perfect but it is always a pleasure to watch this movie  full of scenes of anthology.<br />A DVD not to be forgotten.
B005K2XRYE|5|Perfect case to put your Kindle Fire! I always travel with my kindle and I needed to make sure that I didn't scratch my Kindle!
0767903862|5|I can't tell you how excited I was that a friend chose this book for our monthly book club read.  After reading the first 2 pages, I was already laughing out loud--needless to say, I was hooked! He writes with such a friendly and casual tone that it feels like you're in the room beside him as he recounts his amazing adventures. He entertains the reader with countless hilarious (and true!) stories of Australia's founders, prime ministers, sports, wildlife, and locals, and makes you realize just how odd and fascinating the country is.  Always in the mood for a road trip, I loved that it felt like I was right beside him as he explored the coastal cities and the great outback.    Out of the five 30-somethings in our book club, 3 of us LOVED the book, while 2 gave it mediocre reviews because it did have a \\"wandering\\" feel to it and was a departure from the action-packed plot lines they are used to.  However, I can't praise this book enough, and I know infinitely more about Australia and its lovable quirks than I ever did before.
B003KUSUG8|4|Great deal on black friday! Super fast shipping.  Great album.  Couldnt be happier with this purchase!  I think about any album for 4.99 and shipped for free is a great deal!
B0027Z837S|5|A stylish, incredibly absurd, slapstick action comedy, Kung Fu Hustle is a hilarious spoof of the kung fu movie genre and, I think, one of the best of the wonderful comedies Hong Kong is known for. The cast is fantastic and Stephen Chow, as the hero and the director, has done a great job of combining the sensibilities of the kung fu/gangster movie with Chuck Jones.
B005MYEPXC|5|Love Owen Wilson. This is a keeper. We have watched this movie several times and have loaned it to friends as well.
B00AF6MF9I|4|I love the different terrains you can play on.It does take alittle time to get use to thegame playing.I think its real fun and keep on building and upgrading.
B004YW4L5K|5|great booK
B00JG5MS32|1|This is a horrible spin off of goat simulator it's best just buying the original. Not worth it!
B008OOYALE|5|I absolutely am in love with this game! It's so entertaining, and gives me something I love to do in my spare time. The dragons are so cute and the mechanics of completing tasks emphasizes the way you should care for your dragons. This game brings me euphoria and I'm sure you will love it as well.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love how this teaches people ho Tw to care for and train your horse almost like real life. This is a truley fascinating and educational game.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is very important and rewarding for me. I could play it all day but I run out of lives.
0756666937|5|this is a marvelous book .. it almost resembles an encyclopedia and provides a wealth of information on legos for my<br />grandson who is a legos aficianado... it was exactly what i wanted for his Christmas gift... excellent shipping service.
B00005AFVR|4|The amazing stuff here is that there´s not even one bad moment in this entire double CD! What you got here is exactly the same as the DVD (but with a few less songs). If you know the DVD&lt; you know that this CD is a must to have.<br />The energy in this show (actually, the best of two shows realized in Madison Squared Garden in 2000) is unbeliavable! THIS IS A ROCK AND ROLL BAND!
B000683VI4|2|the most pretentious, predictable movie. :/ i don't know why people refer to it as being one of the best romances... i normally like romance / drama movies but it's too predictable, no point watching when you know how it's going to turn out. i prefer titanic, the painted veil, romeo & juliet, benjamin button, atonement, etc to this. don't even get me started on superior foreign romances (moment to remember, frozen flower, my sassy girl). there are many more interesting romances than the notebook...maybe i just dislike nicholas sparks stories.
B004SIIBGU|5|Nice to be able to watch my account away from home.
B00ILHW6AG|5|The novel kept me waiting and waiting and as usual Stephen King didn't disappoint. Subtle hints along the way as to the ending but it is a must-read Stephen King novel.
B00FAX6XQC|4|Very fun game to play.
0525950079|5|Book is as good as new
B0055PGUYU|5|So interesting and so helpful. I love the way the author wove real life examples into what could have been a rather dry topic about neurology and habits. I'm recommending the book to everyone I talk to.
B001NLL93W|5|Amazing
B003UESJDS|1|Does not engage the viewer
B00821OX98|5|This is great for anyone who likes stories about alien invasions. The characters are well cast and it holds your interest can wait to find out what happens next.
B004MC8CA2|5|This is an awesome app that allows you to compare the Bible in many different versions, so you can get a better understanding of what you are reading. I would definitely recommend. Thank you.
B007HC3LHS|4|Didn't think I'd like it at first, but became engrossed quickly.  Liked the back and forth style til the stories caught up.
B00005A1PR|5|i first heard india arie when she came out on the bamboozled soundtrack with 'in my head' and 'can i walk with you,' and from those first listens i knew she had talent.  she's since gone on to blow up with 'video,' and from listening to the rest of this album, it looks like miss india arie has staying power.  she has a gorgeous...soulful sound mixed with funk and smooth r&b, holding her own against neo-soul artists such as amel larrieux, angie stone, macy gray, erykah badu, and the superb jill scott.  her positive messages of identity, strength, spirituality, & faith make her a definite treasure in today's radio hip-hop/r&b market of 'money, cash...dubs, sippin' crystal,' etc.  some highlights include:<br />'simple' - simply sublime & my favorite track on the album. exquisite lyricism layered over an edgy beat. <BR> 'video' - just about everyone's heard this already.  positivity at its best.  <BR>  'butterfly' - sultry & funky.  the epitome of neo-soul.
B003R4ZMNQ|5|HERE VERY QUICKLY, AND JUST AS EXPECTED
B006T76FEI|5|Freakin' Awesome book. Full of amazing info that's not only amusing and sometimes hilarious, but really helpful stuff that will (if you do what it says) make your life so much better. But it NOW!!!
B005VQRPME|5|who loves music, have to have this album on sacd, I listen this album everyday, this sacd sounds incredible !!
B0067EKY7M|5|Well liked!
B00AIUUXHC|5|i got the game and it was great i played it everyday and got addicted i highly recommend this game
B00CQHZ32U|5|I use these as decorations on cakes perfect size for that.
B006LSZECO|3|I feel cheated.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is very addictive and fun. It is not too hard but not too easy either. I like it a lot
B009ZZDNT6|5|This free alarm clock was perfect.
B006LSZECO|4|I had a really hard time putting this book down.  There were so many twists and turns, I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next.  Was it unrealistic, yes.  I wasn't looking for realistic.  I was looking for an escape--a great book to keep my attention!  The ending was a little odd, but at the same time it fit with the twisted nature of the whole book.  I haven't read anything by Flynn before, but have already put another of her books on hold a the library. I can't wait to see what else she has to offer!
B00C8S9W0G|5|This is by far my favorite series of books.  I waited for a long time to read book 8.  There were several cliff hangers that needed to be solved.  I love the research that Diana puts into her books.  I feel like I am living in the times that Diana has written about.
B000PDYVVG|4|This was such an inspiring book!!  I loved it as it enhanced my spiritual and prayer life.
B00BLRXDTQ|5|Gotta love Mad Max.
B000WGWQG8|5|How very lucky we were to have those men at that time!! In these days of superficial debates about flag pins and flip flops and other nonsense items and accusations about relatively meaningless things like who's more arrogant or whose preacher is more offensive or who panders more to whom, it is especially poignant to be reminded about the great stakes we had then and have today and an vivid example of a much more effective way to address our challenges and find ways to work together. These imperfect men gave us a tremendous gift - one we would be wise to treat with greater care than our current political diatribe demonstrates.
B008DL466C|5|It came on time, new and in perfect condition! Love all the songs!
B00957T6X6|5|Really good series. So many characters they can be hard to track, obviously some are more entertaining than others. Good history and scope for a fantasy, most fall short and the world feels too small. I don't think anyone has ever said that a song of ice and fire feels too small.
B005HSL626|5|This is quite a stress-reliever. Anytime I have a bad moment I'm able to pay this game a calm down. I'm always able to laugh and smile while playing this game. Best choice I could have made for entertainment and I would recommend everyone to purchase this app
B00005KARK|4|A great little movie about individuality and uniqueness.  A celebration of diversity and strength of character.  From Dumbo believing in himself as the world's only flying elephant, to Casey Jr, the circus train who \\"thought he could\\".  A playful and mischievous tale to captivate children and delight adults.  Witness it's ability to elicit a tear from the military, in Steven Spielberg's wartime comedy \\"1941\\".  It's full of beautiful and catchy songs, and clever characters, with the politically incorrect black crows, and some of the most inspired animation ever, with the non-PC \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\".  Enjoy it through the eyes of a child.<br />But \\"Dumbo 2\\"?  The big question is: WHEN WILL DISNEY STOP MAKING SEQUELS TO THEIR CLASSICS?! Please stop now!<br />We DON'T want to see \\"Snow White & the EIGHT Dwarfs\\", \\"Bride of Hunchback\\", \\"Pinocchio Hits ...\\", or a live action version of \\"Pocohontas\\" (wasn't it that anyway?).. and \\"288 Dalmations\\" is definitely two ...! (yes, bad pun intended)<br />Stop messing with our memories!  Stop making sequels!  Stop making remakes!  Stop making sequels to remakes.  Did the Disney company ever hear the phrase \\"happily ever after\\"?  That's when a child's own imagination is meant to take over.  Leave it at that!<br />Some things were meant to be keep in a state of suspended animation (maybe even Walt).  Yes, you're one of the biggest corporations in the world.. but how much more greedy can you get? How about concentrating on your new material?  Warners has caught up already and outclassed you with \\"The Iron Giant\\".  Develop fresh ideas and reward originality and creativity.. or you'll run out of back-catalogue to plunder!
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is awesome. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes games.  this has my highest recommendation huz&agrave;h. to the game makers
B00004XMV6|4|Mickey Was his wonderfull romantic self in 9 1/2 and it made as a good &quot;fall in love movie&quot;.
B00488WPRQ|5|Don't even thinking about blinking for a second because there is not a boring moment in the film. If you like suspense this wins the prize. Excellent acting and story line.<br /><br />At the end the movie you'll start thinking about what you real stand for in life.
B00338QENI|5|This was a book that i got from work as a presale book before it came out. It looked interesting so I thought why not. It did not disappoint. Rebecca Skloot gave so much information yet I continue to want to learn more about HeLa
B0034DGPEU|4|If a book can goose my imagination, allow me to effortlessly track characters, geography and plot, and compel me to see it all in expressive color, then I'm in. The Kitchen House held me -- I regretted after two days of active reading that it had to end! Even now, a few days later, I find myself thinking about the characters and the fates I imagine for them.<br /><br />Many reviewers have expressed concern over historical accuracy; I respect that, though I took the story on face value, as I was on this ride simply for the escape good fiction provides. I'd have given this book five stars were it not for some editing lapses, including in the spelling of Will \\"Stephens\\" (for most of the book, electronic version) and, later, Will \\"Stevens.\\" Sorry, but that's just sloppy. Otherwise, colorful, wonderful read!
B0085W6II8|2|I think this is my first negative review of an album.  I got this after Chris Squire recent passing.  I didn't know this recording existed, but thought Hackett/Squire?  Could be good. Not.<br /><br />Not much Chris Squire in this and Steve Hackett, while I have respect for the guy, a lot of his work seems to be pretty much the same, and over the years I've heard/owned a lot of his music.  Nothing new or exciting here.  I had higher hopes.  Rest in peace Chris.
0553801503|5|Alot of you people have written that there is too much useless info in the book. Hello! What are you, stupid? When do you get alot of information about something that hasn't been put to good use? When we learn about all these new people and places, it adds to the already richness of the story. This book, and probably the next(both being the same book but split in two), will be set-up books. To reach the climax, or the top of the hill, you need to tread on the steps first. These two books are the steps to the climax, or as I like to call it, the feast. So, if there are too many characters and too many places and too many concepts for you, loser, then try something of a smaller scope-Velveteen Rabbit.
0425170349|5|I loved the book.  I spent hours of reading it in the car and other places.  I recomend this book for any fan of Tom Clancy or someone that just loves action.  I really got a feel for what beeing in an anti  terrorist orginizatio.  The bottom line is READ THIS BOOK!!!
B003YL4LYI|5|I'm already looking for publishing dates of the next book... The most interesting thread is Tyrion so far, and dragons of course.
B004JZBGWI|5|I love this app. I have it on my cell phone and it comes in super handy if I need to jot something down and I don't have pen and paper.
B00B7ERH04|1|No way to view video after taking it with the app.  Seems like a pointless app.  Don't waste your time.
0345373243|4|I waited for 'Belgarath the Sorcerer' with great expectation; hoping to finally know more about Belgarath with his mysterious past; about what really made him the man he appears to be in the Belgariad and Mallorean series; to really know the history of the Eternal Man. In this aspect the book lived up to my expectation, yet I was disappointed in a way. There seems to be some humor missing in Eddings' approach to the whole story. The beginning was entertaining enough but then it started to get boring. This might be caused by the 'I' (that is Belgarath's) point of view of the whole story. I personally think the Belgariad series is the best work Edding has done, with the Mallorean series following close behind. I still take up a book from these two series and still feel the thrill of turning each page to reveal what happens in the next pages (despite the fact that I've probably read the whole thing a dozen of times). It's still worth the time reading it. This is not the same thing I can say about Eddings' prequel to the saga. I haven't picked up this book and read it again from cover to cover since the time I finished reading it for the first time. However, devout readers of Eddings should definitely not miss this book since it offers more insight to the Belgariad realm. It's nice to know more about Belgarath, but this book lacks the thrill and humor of Eddings previous books, which just proves the point that history is not meant to be entertaining
B001UTW7QU|5|Its an awesome show. Makes you use your mind. It streches your imagination to the fullest.  I believe its better than the X Files
B003VVFGWC|5|I love the entire series!  I wish it hadn't been canceled after only three seasons.  The series is creative, witty, interesting and original.
B00BU8RNCE|5|I love both actors but i came into this movie feeling like they just wouldn't be able to do it any justice as its based on a real life story but I was completely blown away by Naomi Watts and Tom Holland's performances...so much so that I forced everyone in my house hold to watch it along with &#34;it's a wonderful life&#34; during the holiday season that just passed...it was a success! =)<br /><br />Naomi should have won...sorry J.Law!
B0063IH60K|5|Love this app very fun to play highly recommended however need more pictured cards and more color chooses for background
B003YK42LQ|5|I loved this CD and just recently became a KOL fan.  Only by the night was amazing and I downloaded all their other albums and this is top 2 for me.
B00E8LUAKC|1|Please avoid this version. It is not a newly 2013 remaster and is not SHM. It is the old 1995 version and even states that on the OBI strip on the back. The sound quality on this version is very poor for a Japanese copy. Too bad as this is a fantastic album!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Love the game!!!!!!! So much fun!!! I am glad it is free! My friends have it to<br /> they love it!!!!
B000UBMSB8|4|Well it does say &#34;Collector's Edition&#34;.  Seriously though if you grew up in the 80's and grew up watching this every time it was on TV then this is for you.  In addition to the 4 versions, the set is packed with extras.  Some of the featurettes will include new bits of information and definitely new footage and interviews.  If your a fan of Blade Runner, Harrison Ford, Ridley Scott or dark dystopian futures then its definite buy.
081298160X|3|The book can be summarized by the following:<br />1) identify the routine<br />2) experiment with rewards<br />3)isolate the cue<br />4) have a plan<br />The rest, a good 70% are fillers of various successful examples and experiments, which are rather irrelevant with the explanation of the steps of how to get rid of a given habit.  Plus, at some point the author starts to talk about how some successful companies turned around to the better, because of some good strategy... nonsense :) I have to look for some other books.
B001UN1KVE|5|Laugh out loud funny in 1987 - just as good in 2012. Most people probably know the plot line by now, but if not this is a funny parody of the Star Wars movies. The upgrade to Blu-ray works surprisingly well for a film made in the 80's. If you are thinking you would like to re-visit this funny movie with better audio and video, the price point should convince you. Money well spent.
B00H43WOAK|5|I like it
B002MQYOFW|5|Easy to see why this became a best-seller. I've not seen the movie yet, but i DVR'd it last night.
B001DJLCRC|5|Has anyone buying this not watched the show already? This is show is one of the greatest dramas of all time. I rank it #2.
B003O86FMW|5|I actually liked this book better than the first one. The whole twelve hour clock with new horrors and scary jungles was soooo interesting. It was not too sad, but definitely glt you on the edge of your seat. The only thing is Katniss. She has always seemed to be one dimensional, only seeing, truth, fear, anger, and sadness.
B00LP9E79U|3|I thought the characters were great! Tilda, most especially. Her character was so vile I was so disgusted every time they show her.<br /><br />The concept of the movie is definitely original. It's post-apocalyptic and the only remaining humans live on a train. Really cool idea but it leaves so many questions. SPOILERS!!!!! Like, how can they still distinguish the bodies of the first 7 people who revolted. It's been snowing for more than 17 years, The bodies should be all covered by then. And at the end they revealed how the train works. Ok, sure, kids manually do the job but I'm sure they get tired from doing it. They can't work 24/7 doing just that.<br /><br />Having said that, I think the movie is still good. I would highly recommend it. Just don't find answers or meaning to everything you see and take it as it is. It's hard to make sense on things that doesn't have any.
B0087IT8FK|5|Shipped as advertised and was perfect addition to a classroom project we were working on.  I'm very pleased that the order arrived as advertised.

0670024783|4|THE INVENTION OF WINGS<br /><br />It took me two times to try and get into this book, but once I did, wow, I couldn't stop reading.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit -- but will!  -- that I didn't realize this was a true historical novel based on the life of abolitionist/women's rights advocate Sarah Grimke and her sister Nina Grimke.  Duh.  Once I figured this 'startling' fact out, I enjoyed the book even more.<br /><br />INVENTION OF WINGS is the story of Sarah and Nina Grimke told from their childhood till they are seniors.  Born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, Sarah and Nina are uncommonly close for sisters,  They are raised with other siblings in a well-to-do family enjoying the benefits of high society in the early 1800's.  Of course, as was the practice then, the Grimke family owns slaves.  In fact, when Sarah turns eleven, she is 'given' Hetty - also known as Handful - as a gift.  Sarah's  entire being, heart, and soul, hates having Hetty as a slave and 'owning' her -- but the two young girls form a deep and loving friendship that spans decades.<br /><br />Sue Monk Kidd did her homework and did it well.  As you read this book, Kidd blends fiction and fact very smoothly, so smooth in fact that you will wonder what actually took place in history and what did not.  The story is true and at times is brutal.  Both Sarah and Handful bear sorrow, disappointments, losses, happiness, always trying to stick together and be there for each other.<br /><br />The book is moving and shocking at times.  The story of the treatment of slaves opens your eyes and you will applaud Sarah and Nina Grimke for their outspoken and courageous fight against the horrors of slavery.  These two women helped shape and change American history and the lives of millions of people.<br /><br />Their journey was hard, their battles vicious, their sacrifices many.  Sarah and Nina didn't ever give up the fight.  Get this book and read their stories, along with Handful's.  I loved how Sarah and Handful each told the story in their alternating voices.  The plot is true and interesting, the characters fleshed-out, the history coldblooded and fascinating.<br /><br />If you are someone who enjoys historical fiction, people who made a difference in our world, and just a darn good read, this is a book you will truly delight in.<br /><br />Thank you.arah and Handful each told the story in their alternating voices.

B00QW8TYWO|5|SOOO funny! I can't stop playing! Reminds me of fogger!
B00BD99JMW|5|I am absolutely in love with this series. I read the first and second novel and the series and this is a great way to tie everything up. I must admit that I found the first book to be my favorite, but this one held up its own. I highly recommend this book to anyone who isn't already hooked on the series. My only complain is with the huge plot twist at the end, I found it to be a bit anti-climatic. Overall a great book, but an even more amazing series.
B00QFR8A6S|5|Jane Austen is a great writer .Even though her books were written over 100 yrs. ago ,she knew people and they haven't changed that much . Pride and prejudice is my favorite of her books . Her wit and humor is great. It is also a great way to find out about history and how people lived in the 1700s .
6304167660|5|For a movie that did not make a splash or even a ripple when it was released ( I stumbled across it on T.V. several months ago)this show has become my favorite all time.  Dillon and his group of friends make you remember those times of hanging out worrying about trivial things like where you were going to drink beer that night or if you could make it another month with your girlfriend.  Relating to this show is easy and it makes you miss those confusing times that you relate to.  One of the best parts of this show to me is when the &quot;gang&quot; is in their neighborhood tavern run by one of their friends, his cousin played by Uma Thurman comes in and catches their attention.  All of the guys react and do their best to impress the girl from the big city.  Friends being there for each other in different ways makes this a very uplifting show.

B00005OAA6|5|When I first bought this CD, I thought it wasn't very good. I listened to the first song, didn't like it and then put it away. Today, I decided to take it out and listen all the way through. I was extremely suprised. I wasn't a Spice Girl fan, but bought this CD because I just liked the cover art (Stupid, I know) and now I'm GLAD that I picked it up. Victoria has clearly improved her voice since her &quot;Spice&quot; days, and also honed her songwriting skills (Writing/Co-Writing many of the albums tracks) Its an excellent euro-pop album, and while its not like any of these songs trigger intense emotions or anything, they are fun. Its a good CD to drive to, or put on at a party. Definatley worth the extra $$ for import. Victoria's latest work (Let Your Head Go/This Groove) Is also worth checking out.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|I truly enjoy playing this game! I've never been into racing games, but Asphalt 8 truly is a delight to play. I love how you can switch cars for different races and that you can upgrade your existing cars. The upgrades really make a difference on your car immediately which helps you to win more races. Haven't tried the online portion yet, but will soon. For those of you who like racing games, check this one out. You'll like it too.

B00GSJ9X4Q|4|A clever solution for those with only one drive bay, this saved me the expense of buying a much larger SSD that would have been double the price of this drive.<br />Its not the best performing SSD on the market, other review sites place this ssd in the middle of the pack. With that said, the SSD is still fast and will give a very considerable performance improvement if you're upgrading from a conventional hard disk drive.<br />The driver installs easily into win7 64bit and is invisible once installed.<br />Transfer rate between the SSD and the 1tb drive is very fast as well, in the range I see with USB 3.0 transfers (35-40mb/s).<br />Power consumption is a bit high, I didn't quantifiy it but I doubt it will significantly improve battery capacity, might even hurt it a bit.<br />I updated the drive's firmware and drive got quite a bit quieter and spent less time spinning up to speed. It was abit of apin updating the firmware with a multiple reboots, but its worth the effort.

B000UR9TQO|5|Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is very poorly designed with flimsy card-board and undersized T-Shirt.

B0008ENIAC|5|Peerless Warners director Michael Curtiz creates a diabolical murder yarn. Crawford resuscitated her fading career with the driven Mildred, a part she was born to play. Blyth grates as Veda (hard for her not to), and Scott and Carson each ooze their particular brand of acid as the calculating men in Mildred's life. For a vicarious glimpse into seamy small town intrigue, you can't beat this one. Joan won Oscar.
B000002KXV|5|This is the finest Album Donald Fagan ever did.    What amazes me is that it sounds so good and sounds so fresh it just makes me shake my head to think this recording is now 25 years old.    Interestingly, when this album was recorded it was done Completely digital which was rare at the time.  The only Analog was the mastering to Vinyl.    So since it was digitally recorded it was no problem taking this to CD format.  It sounds like it was always a CD.    Recording and musical performances are all  \\"FAGAN FLAWLESS.\\"    check this one out it really is the Desert Island CD.   I listen to this in the car on the boat and at home.  Never get tired of this.  25 years old?  Impossible.  25 Years Young.

B001KVZ6F2|5|Great movie. No complaints...
B001FB4W0W|5|I pre-ordered this DVD after watching the first season on HBO, and I could barely wait for them to release it! I would agree with other reviewers that the cast is the best part of the series - every actor is top-notch, and every one of them is perfect for the role they are in. Anna Paquin as Sookie is a delight, but really everyone is well worth watching, and I find myself excited to see even the minor characters in each episode. If I had to pick a favorite, I would say that Nelson Ellis as Lafayette is it.     For those of you who have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels, there are definite changes from the books to the series. I am a fan of the books, but I still like what the writers have done in adapting the novels, since it would be boring to just follow Sookie everywhere, and because many other more minor characters are fleshed out, such as Jason, Tara, Hoyt Fortenberry, Andy Bellefleur, Terry Bellefleur, Arlene, etc. What results is clearly based on the books but expanded and developed to make for a delightful, passionate, and action-packed season. Watching the series after having read the books can be difficult, since you know what 'should' happen, but I found that I wasn't ever disappointed by any changes.     I've enjoyed watching the extras, but the commentary is not something I like, since it goes over the dialogue of the episodes.     A note for those who might not be familiar with the content of the series - it has many mature themes, with sex and violence, but I found that it is quite tasteful and meant to convey the key ideas of the series. Just a warning - not for children!

6305291446|4|It is rather amazing that the reputation of the original \\"Halloween\\" has not been tarnished by all the sequels that have come down the road in the last quarter century.  Whatever eloquence the first film had was replaced by as much explicit bloodletting as possible in \\"Halloween 2\\" and the fun has been continuing ever since.  \\"Halloween: H20\\" is an attempt, of sorts, to get the series back on track.  The idea is that the fourth, fifth and sixth films in the series never happened and we are now twenty years after the original bloodletting in the first two films.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back, all grown up with her own teenage son, only now she is running a private boarding school and calling herself Keri Tate.  This is not just because she is trying to escape the notoriety of being the sister of Michael Myers but also because she knows deep down inside that her brother is still out there somewhere trying to kill her.  Of course she is right; just do not ask what he has been doing for two decades, wandering around the country wearing that William Shatner mask painted white.<br />From a historical perspective \\"Halloween\\" was the first film where the slasher kept getting up every time he was put down.  Hard to believe that once upon a time this was a \\"new\\" idea, because certainly it has been done to death (pardon the phrase).  We are actually at the point where we are surprised in a film where the killer is killed and is actually dead.  The killer who cannot die has become such a commonplace it has gone well beyond the slasher genre.  What this means is that by the time we get to this film there is nothing new regarding his ability to survive knife slashes, blows from an ax, a rock being pounded on his skull, and other substantive physical assaults.  We have seen it all before and whether the slasher's name is Michael Myers, Jason, or whatever, it does not matter anymore.<br />That means the success of this film has a lot more to Laurie's end of the story than Michael's, and in that is the regard in which this film falls short.  It is made clear that Laurie has been thinking about this day (okay, this night; he always comes out at night) for two decades.  Given that she is running a private school (and recalling her answer regarding fate in her English class back in 1978) we also know that this is a smart person.  Surely in all that time she has come up with hundreds of plans on how she will stop her brother from driving a big knife into her body.  I mean, come on, remember what Nancy was able to put together in one night for Freddy Krueger.  Laurie Strode cannot do better?  Sigh.  Jamie Leigh Curtis deserved a better script than this for coming back and lending her considerable cache to the series that made her the original Scream Queen.  Just go back and watch the original to remember what made this stuff work in the first place.<br />Final comment: Did you ever thing that Janet Leigh's car in \\"Psycho\\" had blue tones?  That sure surprised me.than Michael's, and in that is the regard in which this film falls short.

B0000CDLA7|4|I wish that I had written my review earlier. There are so many things that I want to say about this album that have probably already been said (over 500 reviews already!). Ok, screw it. I'll just say what I want anyway. Haha!<br /> This is definitely a rocker of an album. Although DT is a prog-rock band, they have always been influenced by the heavier side of metal. Pantera, Napalm Death and early Metallica to name a few. On this one, it sure shows. They have found a way to combine power and loads of distortion with complex riffs, odd time signatures and melodic, catchy vocals. Here's a break down:<br /><br />#1 - As I am - Great opening track. Starts out slow and moody and then picks up the tempo to make for a heavy, crunching tune. The lyrics are a rebellious stand against conformity. A very well written song in all.<br /><br />#2 - This Dying Soul - This one isn't one of the heavier tracks, but it's a good one nonetheless. As is typical of DT, it starts out completely different from where it ends up. I thought the intro and verse were ok, but the chorus and ending did it for me. The bridge about midway reminded me of Metallica's Blackened. Then, at the very end, John Petrucci sounds like he went on speed, even for him. Check it out!<br /><br />#3 - Endless Sacrifice - Probably the most musically diverse track on the disc, this is a rather lengthy 10min+ epic. The intro and verse are slow and very melodic, up until the chorus. Then, the song picks up with a heavy riff and doesn't slow back down. I really like the transition at the end from instrumental back into vocals. Very cool stuff here.<br /><br />#4 - Honor thy Father - Starts with a very cool drum intro and then goes into a syncopated guitar riff. From then on, the song stays pretty constant, without much variation. One of the heavier and cooler tracks. I especially liked the chorus. The instrumental stuff at the end was subpar for DT, but still a very good track.<br /><br />#5 - Vacant - Honestly, I usually skip over this one. I'm not too much into ballads, especially when there's no change and it sounds like a droning effort to just put something different on the album. This is the Space Dye Vest of this disc.<br /><br />#6 - Stream of Consciousness - Normally, I'm into DT's instrumentals. In this case, I found myself bored and disinterested in this track. Maybe they set the bar too high with Erotomania and Dance of Eternity, but this one failed to keep it flowing.<br /><br />#7 - In the Name of God - Another long one. I really liked this track. It rocks and then it slows down for a moody, heartfelt chorus. It ranks up there with Endless Sacrifice as a diverse track. DT nicely rounds the disc out with a great show of musicianship.<br /><br />In a nutshell, there were 2 tracks I was disappointed with, but the rest really made up for it. A very solid album by the prog masters.<br /><br />Now that I've said what I needed to about the album, I want to take a little more time to address some of the critics. First, it doesn't matter how long they take in the writing process. Remember, Liquid Tension is all spontaneous. Maybe they didn't want to (or couldn't) take too much time before recording. Songs do sound a lot different in the studio than on your rig at home. Also, stop comparing this to their old albums. It's one thing to reference their old material to make a point, but it's another thing to use it as a base for how you're judging the new album. Musicians have to grow and go in different directions from time to time. They're still Dream Theater. Also, I disagree with the people that say this album is sloppy and not well done. They did stuff on this album that they've never done before. You have to try new things. I'm sure you don't want a clone of Images and Words being put out again and again. Don't worry, I don't think they're gonna pull another black album on us.<br /><br />Well, I've said my peace. DT is one of my favorite bands and this album is further testimony to that declaration. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of those 2 tracks. But, it's still a must listen for any DT or prog-metal or any metal fan.

The plot had some surprising twists but most importantly there were &#34;life lessons&#34; and thought provoking situations.  I don't remember any foul language but there was some violence...not the typical Hollywood added on for effect type.  IMHO most people will like this film.

B00CEZJT2E|4|Picked this up as a new accessory to my HTC One.  The one gets decent battery life, but not enough to get me through when traveling.  This battery is slim, portable, and good for 2.5 full phone charges.  Very convenient and high quality.  There were a few things missing that I would like to have seen, like a built-in USB cable so that no external cables would be required.  The micro-USB cable is nice for charging the phone, but a USB for plugging into a wall charger would be a nice touch and eliminate the need for all external cables. (My wife has another brand battery pack and hers has this feature.)  Additionally, hers came with a small felt carry pouch, which would be convenient as well.  Overall, this is a great product and my complaints are minor.

I advise buying two copies - one to put in safekeeping storage forever, and the other to listen to until you've literally burned a hole in the disc or corrupted the files on your computer to the point of unplayability.  Is it really that good, you ask?  Yes, yes it is.

B00005RYLE|2|My special edition (the last DVD release) may not be letterbox (which sucks) but it does have a clear, crisp picture. I rented this before buying, man am I glad it saved me the money. The transfer is THX mastered, which means it's been filtered through a computer. Well it didn't work. The film is dark, often blurry and hard on the eyes. Sure there's a couple of nifty documentries on this disk, but the cheesy cover? Really, a collectable? It's lame, seriously. If you want a 16:9 copy, look for the new version without the $20.00 cover.<br />But really, they need to do a restoration on this film and finally, finally give us a last (this is the 13th DVD version)version of this classic.<br />Don't but the lame cover, or the crappy transfer.

B0080K3G4O|5|Oliver Burkeman may be surprised to discover that he has an ally in Dr. Martin Seligman, the founding father of positive psychology.  Dr. Seligman has been quoted as saying that he is disturbed at how his ideas about optimism and happiness have been become caricatures that are far removed from what he intended.  He is now saying that it is important for people to acknowledge and experience the full range of emotions -- from the most positive to the most negative.  And that there is a great deal of meaning to be discovered and uncovered in negative emotions.<br /><br />I do wish that we would all stop labeling emotions as 'positive' and 'negative.'  Those terms impose an unfair value judgement. We need to rescue non-positive emotions from the garbage heap and restore them to their rightful place in the lexicon of emotions.

B009MF56GC|5|As I have expected and even more, the movie is full of actions but more action greats. I enjoyed watching the old-timers back in action. And with more macho-style sarcastic humors infuse in the dialogue, I can't ask for more except more action stars in the next sequence?
B002VPE1AW|5|This movie is probably the best one ever filmed.  The characters are amazing and the film absorbs you so much that you do not realize the length of it.  The theme of this film is an old one, but a goody. This is a must for everyone.

B001GQACGO|2|At first, I thought that Beyonce was kind of corny for referring to her alter ego as Sasha, but I must say that Beyonce has created a monster!   I totally agree with some of the other reviews regarding Beyonce's (and her team) horrible idea to stretch out the album onto 2 discs.  The total recording time for both discs is only a little over sixty-two (62) minutes - 62:26 to be exact.  All of these songs plus a few more could have fit on one disc!      I didn't enjoy listening to Disc 1.  With the constant radio play, I'm already tired of \\"If I were a Boy\\" and the other songs are somewhat depressing.  They aren't romantic or sexy at all.  In fact, Beyonce's voice is monotone throughout the entire disc, she doesn't show any versatility at all.  It's like one long cry.    Now, Disc 2 is a different story.  Thank God for producers Bangladesh and Darkchild.  The beats on this disc are sick - Back to back total club bangers.  And Beyonce is just riding the track ever so lovely.  Ignore the repetitive and nonsensical lyrics and just dance the night away!!  Actually, I would probably enjoy the instrumentals of Disc 2 even better.    Finally, Beyonce is a great entertainer but I think she should reveal less of herself  (I AM) and stick to her regular booty shaking tracks that people have loved time and time again.      Originally, I gave this CD two and a half bright and shining stars solely for Ms. Fierce, but I took away half a star for Beyonce's choice to gyp her fans by having a \\"standard\\" cd and a \\"deluxe\\"  edition.   As I mentioned earlier, that was totally unnecessary as all of the songs could fit on one disc.

B000NVIXFK|3|Yes, buy the album! Though the album is not set for release until May 1st, I have received a copy through a local radio station contest \\"Win it before you can buy it\\" promo. This album is a mix of Vapor Trails, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures. The best track by far on this album, \\"Spin Drift\\" is a spacey psychedelic feast for the ears and is a bit reminiscent of Witch Hunt and is really unlike anything RUSH has done before.  What is different about this album, is that there are THREE instrumentals consisting of - \\"The Main Monkey business\\", the acoustic power ballad \\"Hope\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\", all of which are superb and leave you wanting more! Probably the most odd of the tracks is \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" Which starts out as a heavy blues riff, and sounds like B.B. King high on a compound mixture of Viagra, Adderral and Ecstasy, but then shortly shifts into a heavy groove hitting classic rush tune. The song is a bit confusing, musically, (shifting from blues to rock and then to blues again) but it works and is definatly an original that only Rush can pull off!! Geddy's bass work is absolutely phenominal, with a lower \\"Tool\\" bass sound, and Alex never ceasing to amaze me with his complex, yet groove hitting guitar riffs! Neil compliments the album, though not as much as a presence as heard on previous Rush albums (is Neil mellowing out?). Definately a 3 star album!
B00GCV9S3Q|5|I love these guys' voices. I have the CD in my car and keep thinking I should switch it out but just don't want to! The voices are amazing,  the music is interesting, all the songs are very different from the other songs on the album. Witty and fun lyrics. Keeps me smiling.

B00VRYCGLO|5|I love this game. It is easy enough to be fun and hard enough to be a challenge. Need more like this.
B0009X7664|5|This movie came in excellent condition, it was never opened and came with extra's, copies of the billboard's from different countries. Just wonderful. I was impressed with every detail.
B008GVD6D8|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's very sexy and enjoyable! I definately recommend it to every woman! I was enthralled with it totall. And I can not wait for the 3rd book! :D
1451666179|5|This book is a lot bigger with a lot more content than I realized it would be! As usual Allie Brosh is on point with her hilarity and is real as hell. Couldn't say anything bad about this book.
B008602KQI|4|I enjoyed watching this movie.  The story is about courage and cunning and is clearly designed for a sequel.  It was time well spent.
B0055SWM08|5|great entertainment that can be enjoyed in two minute or hour increments.  will definitely recommend to any puzzle player or time waster.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is the best ever! You can do lots of things like training dogs, making houses, exploring and much more!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Keeps you guessing and attached to the characters the whole time. Not able to put it down!  It's a good read.
B00JQP111W|5|I love the Blu-Ray transfer of the film. The only extra that was misrepresented was that there was another ending. What you find out is it was never filmed. What you get is pictures that suggest more of a romance between Mitch and Melanie. Also included is a disussion between Alfred Hitchock and Fracois Truffait. After the two movies made about Mr. Hitchcock's life it is clear that Tippi Hedren was right to walk away from Mr. Hitchcock. He was a womanizer and spoke in a very condescending way about Ms.Hedren. Could she have been more, working with different people, yes. It was hinted by another actress, possibly, the late Suzanne Pleshette, he bothered her. But Ms.Pleshette still had a wonderful career. I like what Ms.Pleshette did with the role of Annie Hayward. Jessica Tandy was also interesting as Mrs.Brenner. Nowhere, illustrated as the scene when she leaves the Fawcett farm in horror and later frets to Melanie about Cathy's safety. Hitchcock's films hold up.
0316228532|5|I'm confused by people who complain about kindle prices not being lower. For starters they do not understand the difficult economics of book publishing [printing costs are only a small part of cost--thus only a small difference in cost]. Buying a kindle or ebook reader for cost savings isn't a wise idea--unless you plan to just read public domain books. Used or secondary market physical copies usually cost less or if they aren't it will generally be for a popular book you can buy and easily resell. So while I understand there are good reasons to own a Kindle or Nook, just getting it for saving money seems to be missing the point.<br /><br />Now we await a real review of this book...drumroll please...
B00FATEJYE|5|This is a great game,just one suggestion, easier power credits and energy.I am existed for Casandra Kane Batgirl :). Nightwing New 52 should cost from a range of 120-150 :) over all this game is my favorite game on my kindle :-)
031606792X|5|Well, I'm a huge fan of the twilight saga.  After reading Breaking Dawn i was shocked so many people didn't like it, because Meyer gives us every thing we've been waiting for.  She certainly stretches our imaginitions further, but I felt good about the direction this book went and i really enjoyed reading it.  Actually, i'd have to say that it's my favorite of all 4.  Unlike the other books it was a page turner from beginning to end.
B0007DFJ0G|4|The movie features Edward Norton as a crazy insomniac who had the perfect life but that all changed when he met Tyler, Brad Pitt, who introduced him to a new world of fighting and anti culture.  Norton realizes late the Tyler is going to do and has to stop him.<br /><br />Great work with this movie, It is edited perfectly, The cinematography is great especially the fight scenes.  The cast nails it - Norton, Pitt, Helan Bottham Carter and a cameo from Meatloaf!<br /><br />Great guys flick and the women seem to love Brad Pitt shirtless, this might have something for everyone.
B0064X7FVE|1|I downloaded this app thinking it would be pretty cool  but within 1 min. of downloading the app I lost 3% of my battery life!! I deleted the app right afterwards. I hated the app! dont download it if u do u will delete it just like I did. if I could rate it zero stars I would.  Signed, Julia Miller
B00000FCBC|3|It looks like a really good CD.  Im not too much on recuts but alot of the songs sound good in that typical Metallica style.  I have to admit though that I was not overly impressed with the video to &quot;Turn The  Page&quot;.   I will hold my reasons to myself so as to try not to seem  like a drag on the album.  Overall I am impressed with what I see so far.
B0095ZMMCK|5|Another fast paced book in the Campus series. The events seem plausible. The plot is extreme but believable. I enjoyed it.
0143123173|1|I really enjoyed the Longmire TV series so I bought the first book. I was shocked at the language and I will not buy anymore. It isn't necessary to use that trash to tell a good story and they are good stories, i.e. the TV series. I feel as though I've been cheated from reading some good stories by an excellent writer.
B000002GWN|5|I bought this on vinyl about 18 months ago.. have since purchased the CD.    As a Jazz/Rock/Fusion guitarist, I must say I'm totally obsessed with Robben Ford's work on this album. Especially the rhythm guitar on tracks like 'The Last Time I Saw Richard', 'Carey' and 'You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio'     Tom Scott & The LA Express. Brilliant band!.. Am trying to track down a cheap copy of their first album, but seems to be quite collectable and therefore unobtainable.    I find it hard to believe some people are not happy with this band's take on Joni's wonderful and deeply affecting songs. This version of 'Big Yellow Taxi' for instance isn't so different from versions of Joni performing it solo at the time, similar tempo and upbeat rock. They just added rhythm section and a sax solo! If you want to hear a great and empathetic rhythm section, this is it.     This album confirms Joni Mitchell's genius, artistic decisions and sensibility.. and even amusing.
0316236535|5|This is every 2 to 5 year olds favorite. exceptional.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like how this game isn't so easy that its no fun, but not too difficult to play
B006RUJST6|5|I passed over this book several times, and I wish I wouldn't have! I decided to read it last night, and I was shocked at how fast I was drawn in. This book made me laugh, cry, and swoon. It was the perfect combination for a spectacular read. I tried to tell my friends why this book was so awesome and it was immposible to put it into words. It is just that good!!! When I finished reading at 2am, I decided I had to know what happened next... so I stayed up till 5:30am reading the sequel. It was 'Butterflying' amazing &lt;3
B009G7ZYPY|5|Great collection of songs and very well done. Songs done with real heart and emotion. Music to listen to over and over!
B005COO1X6|1|Ridiculous plot.  Appeals to the mind of a twelve year old boy fascinated by aliens. I love a good mystery, but come on, man eating cars?!
B0026O475M|5|So much emphasis in today's world is placed on having the right gear, having the best technology and having the best skills available.<br /><br />All of those are useless unless the right mentalities are present.  In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non-stop emotion-driven actions taken by Tom Hanks character in order to survive and deal with loss, isolation, frustration and depression, not to mention the physical stresses and injuries which are inflicted throughout the ordeal.<br /><br />From a survival point of view this movie is awesome!  Showing the importance of never giving up, having tenacity, audacity and clinging on to life values which drive us to keep going.  A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented.  A great survival movie!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved this book! Best writing since Gone Girl. I'll read anything Paula Hawkins writes.
B00VFTA70I|5|Very good movie
B00005OAIE|5|This is the best CD I have come in contact with for a very long time.  The absolutely amazing acoustics mixed with John Mayer's sensual voice this easy listening music is sure to relax anyone.  His original lyrics leave room for interpretation ensuring pleasure for all types of people.  With song topics appropraite for all ages it is surprising how few people have discovered this musical genius.  I highly recommend this CD to music lovers everywhere.
055338466X|4|A general overview of the current state of cosmologists' understanding, detailing theories of existence and how and why reality works. It is more brief and compact than other such books, which helps lay readers as it elides the wonkier calculations and instead explains complex concepts with simple metaphors and thought experiments. They authors' tone is dry and analytical, though laced with subtle humor that makes it fresh and highly readable. I followed it well enough until the second to last page, where the authors attempt to answer the book's fundamental question, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" This was answered in a glib and perfunctory way, requiring reference to a concept of \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" energy that hadn't been mentioned earlier and that I couldn't follow -- the discussion of it seemed, to me, logically inconsistent. (For example, gravity is \\"negative\\" energy but a black hole's energy is \\"positive\\" -- huh?) This is no fatal flaw if, like me, you didn't read the book expecting an actual answer. However, it is somewhat out of place in a book otherwise so lucid and methodical, and leaves a bit of an aftertaste.
B001UV4XI8|5|This movie it's a moust have.<br /><br />I have seen it so many times and this blu-ray version is awesome<br /><br />Thanks a lot.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This game is awesome in love I don't care if it gives me nightmares this game is the best can't wait Intel fnaf 3 is coming
B004FRX0MY|3|Fast and easy, but missing some very important and/or new artists.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I simply couldnt put this series down.  I enjoyed every moment and would gladly read more of these books.  The characters kept you rooting for each one in different ways.  Not at all like I thought it would be!
B000NDI3SK|5|This videos are one of the best works made by a scientist trying to educate the general public.  Mr. Bronowski really put all his brains and explains in a very understandable way the origins of Man and his potential future.
193700788X|3|Given the second to last book, I had a horrible feeling what was coming. Which is why I chose to wait to read the book until was I was ready--several weeks after actually buying it.  As are most fans, I am disappointed with her HEA choice. In the end Sam is more of a brother than anything else so the 'love' scene was just 'ick'. Might as well have been Claude.  I think it would have been more realistic to have her end up w/no HEA--open to the future and who it might hold.  I too have no idea what happened to Eric of most of the series--the final book castrates him. In the end though, it was just a bizarre way to deal with the HEA portion of the storyline--I am honestly confused by the last 20 pages of the book.<br />If you want a great series w/a great ending-not necessarily a HEA ending but an awesome ending, stick to the Fae Fever series by Moning. THERE is a way to end a series with a heorine who has evolved into a strong woman.
1423146735|5|Excellent read!!
B00GH4R95C|5|Man of Steel is a fun, action packed movie that my wife and I really enjoyed. I will admit I am not a Superman aficionado and as such I really have no idea how close this movie followed the Superman canon. That said, it had a great story line and was very fun to watch. The destruction in the movie was epic, if not over the top at times. I couldn't help but think about how many normal lives were lost during some of Superman's battles with General Zod and his cronies, but it was a war of sorts and collateral damage is inevitable. My wife, who always reads the reviews, commentary and trivia online while we watch films at home, said that other people had complained about the same issue saying that Superman would have gone to extreme lengths to prevent such deaths by drawing the battle out into sparsely populated areas. That may be so, but the city provided a convenient and target rich environment for wholesale destruction on an epic scale. It was, in a word, awesome.
0307949435|5|I found this book readable, logical and well presented which isn't always the case with science writing. I agree with the authors conclusions. However, I don't think it is likely to create a diet revolution. The dietary limits suggested are so restrictive that I wonder how many people can follow them for any period of time. Everyone I know who lost weight on the Atkins Diet soon gained it back and more<br />because they found it impossible to maintain the required diet restrictions. It may have worked for our ancestors, who didn't have a choice, but I don't think it is going to impact our obesity epidemic when we are surrounded by abundance and choices. I don't think we have found the answer yet.<br /><br />I have been on a low carb diet since I read this book. I am at my ideal weight, my last blood test results were excellent and best of all I feel great and have energy to spare. I am never hungry and have had no problem adhering to the low carb lifestyle. So I changed my rating to 5 stars and I would highly recommend low carb living and Gary Taubs book. I followed the Adkins plan.
0071762345|5|It's a great book you never will be disappointed<br /><br />Buy it if you wanna learn sth about the social media!

B000002IQ9|5|...Uh, excuse me, I have to get this album on CD!
B00005OM4N|5|Britney's Junior album \\"Britney\\" may seem like a more adult album, and it is.Britney is now aiming toward a more adult audience with her music, & so far her transformation is going great.Some great songs on her album include \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Lonely\\" (my personal fave), \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", \\"Bombastic Love\\" & Britney's remix of \\"I Love Rock N' Roll\\". Now I love every song on this CD, but those are my faves out of them all! Trust me, ths album is 5-Star material! Buy it today!  :)
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great series, cannot wait for season 2. Betrayal, loyalty, and deception all in the first two episodes. Vikings are barbaric but extremely religious to their gods.
B00FJTYDKK|5|This is the Funniest kid movie out there.  It was so amusing I couldn't stop laughing! We saw it at the theatre and had to rent it at home! Great job!
B0002EXH5O|5|Love it!
B000021XS0|3|I know many of you think this is the greatest album in the world, but don't stop reading yet. I have been waiting a long time so that I could put my feelings appropriately into words, so here goes.   When I bought this album I just expected a bunch of songs that expanded on Dream Theater's masterpiece, &quot;Metropolis.&quot; What I stupidly did not realize is that this is almost a rock opera, with a storyline and songs that are all connected. There are maybe one or two songs that would sound okay by themselves. So I am grading this based solely of the reason that I bought this for. Many of the songs are toned down and are less progressive metal than lighter rock and Petrucci's long solos are pretty much nonexistant. After I got over the disappointment that this was going to be nothing like &quot;Awake&quot; I listened to it again and was able to appreciate for what it was. And if I had graded this for what it really was instead of what I stupidly thought it was going to be this would get five stars. It has a great storyline and is interesting enough so that the music is there but is not a crucial part of the album. The only thing I can't get is in the final song it sounds like someone (possibly Nicholas) is driving home, pours himself a drink, listens to the news where something bad has just happened in Washington, turns it off, and then all of the sudden, the psychiatrist says, &quot;Wake Up Nicholas!&quot; and then for thirty-forty seconds of distortion. Am I blind or did anyone else not understand it? Anyway, if you are looking for something similar to &quot;Awake&quot; or &quot;Train of Thought&quot; stay away and buy &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.&quot; If you enjoyed The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; or are a diehard Dream Theater fan this is the perfect album for you.
B0083GQKQG|1|This certainly ranks right near the top of both the most boring and depressing movie I've ever seen. It was painful to watch, and I don't know how I made it to the end. How this had a four-star rating is beyond me. Save yourself.
B004HO6HWK|5|Great movie.<br />Anything that stars Jason Statham is always a winner. Quick shipping too. Love my Amazon prime.
B00OICLVBI|5|Excellent! Great way to recognize your mate's and your own needs!
B0090X4GLW|3|I love Pitch Perfect, so for that reason, this product is great.  The down side is that the CD has some songs that sound way different than they do in the movie....if I am buying the soundtrack from a movie, I want it to sound just like it did when I watched it.  The audition song, &#34;Since You Been Gone&#34; is only two of the singers instead of the whole group, and the song from the riff off when Anna Kendrick sings &#34;No Diggity&#34; sounds AWFUL compared to how it is done in the movie.  I also wish they would have included a few more of the songs from the movie, such as the remixes Anna Kendrick's character makes, or when she sings 'Bulletproof' mixed with their performance song.  Overall, while I LOVE this movie, the CD for it really disappoints.
B005S9EK5Y|2|After seeing  a dvd of the film ,I was very disappointed. What went wrong? The acting was  superb as expected.The music  memorable, but I failed to get involved  with the  show which was over-long and bordering on the tedious in places.Almost the entire  film looked like the camera's lens was covered with a dark filter.Why? The rapid editing  really annoyed me. It seems to be the trend today but  in this film they went overboard. There seemed ,for the most part,a new camera angle every 3 seconds or less.I got  dizzy from the rapid  editing. You need to at least  look at a scene without  changing to another  in  a couple of seconds.It ruined the film for me. The opening  scene was  spectacular  but I thought it was totally over the top.There was no need to go back in time for the finale  as  many of the characters seen  were already dead.Filmed versions of musicals used to be superior to the stage shows but in this case the stage show  had a greater impact on me and was unforgettable.If you can get a copy of the  stage show then watch it and compare the difference.The film version was indeed Les Miserables.
B0031RAOVY|5|I've seen this film about 6 times.  It shows the loyalty between a man and his dog.  The movie is based on a true story, which took place in Japan.  His master dies.  He had always met him at the train station every day.  Even until the day he died, he sat there waiting for him every day.<br /><br />Richard Gere was wonderful as the dog's master.
0385523394|3|Show on netflix is better than book
B009B4ZEKM|5|Bought as a gift and they loved it!
B000000XB9|4|For anyone who loves CCR, this is the definitive CD for them... PERIOD! 20  tunes of Rock-N-Roll, and for the price is well well worth it! John Fogerty  has had a tremendous career on his own,but his performances with CCR are  unforgettable. J C Fogerty composed some of the most popular songs in  history, namely: Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising, Fortunate Son (which by the  way, is currently being featured in a popular TV commercial),Up Around The  Bend, and Who'll Stop The Rain. The band had over 14 top 10 hits and sold  millions of records world wide. The song &quot;Proud Mary&quot; is more  associated with Tina Turner, who also made a hit with it. One thing is for  sure, the Amazon.com price for this CD is a steal!
B00ERIUO02|1|This CD is not the best. Listen to royal tailor hold me together.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Loved this story esp the character! Very believable, has u rooting for him through the last page. Great job! Fun entertaining and great surprises.
B001C08RHA|5|I passed by this movie over & over again at the movie store. The box reminded me of some senseless kid audience type of movie. I read good things about the new one coming out this year and read the praises of the first Iron Man. I'm so glad I rented this! I love Robert Downey Jr. and he did a great job, as did Gweneth Paltrow (surprise; I'm not a fan) and Jeff Bridges. It's been a VERY long time since I've enjoyed a movie this much!  Anyway, this movie was a winner from the get go. It was entertaining and enjoyable right to the end. I loved it!!!  Buy it; rent it, but just see it; you won't be sorry!!!
B009UNGYHG|3|It is a good product, but<br />Different view about the scratch<br />I just feel like a typical electronic devices<br />Have not gone to high quality
B0042TV4IW|5|I just love the period programs, especially from BBC!  This one has so many favorites from Downton Abbey and Cranford to mention a couple...  I am only a few episodes in and already it's a favorite! Thank you BBC!
B0001DI0FI|5|To anyone reading this, I promise that you will not regret seeing this wonderful, amazing movie.  <BR>It is the closest thing there is to travelling back in time to be aboard a British warship in 1805. The HMS Surprise pursues a French privateer ship, the Acheron, after surviving a devastating surprise attack at the opening of the movie. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, soundtrack, and attention to historical detail are so well done that it's hard to imagine a more well-made film.  <br />This story is more about the characters than about the political conflicts of its time. It depicts naval life in as much historical detail as possible, and the ways in which the men cope with the isolation and constant danger in their lives. (There are some endearing deleted scenes showing more of this.)<br />The two main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) are old friends who engage in frequent debate about matters of duty, honour, scientific discovery and so on.  Although much of the plot revolves around their friendship, there is such excellent characterization everywhere else in the film that you become truly interested in what happens to everyone we have come to know in this story.  It is a touching story of friendship, courage, resilience, and loss.  It is well worth anyone's while.  It's nice to know that there are so many books in the series- I really look forward to reading them now.
B0000VCZKM|5|Great movie! Fast shipping!

6302470021|1|If you are searching for a dvd copy of the Barry Nelson/Climax Theater 1954 tv presentation DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION. I'm VERY UPSET that Amazon used a review of the 2002 dvd release as a review for the 2008 Collectors/40th Anniversary Edition because I purchased this POS movie solely for that special feature. I guess I should read the reviews a bit more closely!!
B00000DFMN|5|I have searched for this particular CD for years.  I first heard this CD 7 years ago.  I was in awe of &quot;Moments in Love&quot;.  This song had  moved me to feel, imagine, and dream like no other.  This lengthy, melodic,  relaxing classic is a magnificent piece of music.  I am very thankful for  Amazon.com!  I still can't believe I found it!  This song first hit the  airwaves in clubs and quickly became the fave slow jam of every evening.   When it became available to us clubkids on tape, it was sensual and  hallocingenic.  I was saddened when I lost the tape!  I am so overjoyed to  have found it!  Thank You!

B006P4FBUE|4|Works and sounds like as advertised. Lots of fun. Can teach you too.
0679879269|5|This book is truly a wonder. All of its 517 pages will have you eager to see the next one, and the end will leave you aching for another book. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and three days after finishing it I am still in a sort of blissful peace, still savoring every emotion and every word conveyed so masterfully by Phillip Pullman. Beginning with Will's discovery about Lyra's disappearance by way of two angelic messengers from Lord Asriel's realm, he sets off determined to rescue her from her kidnapper. At the same time, the Church of Lyra's world is determined to kill her after discovering her true purpose. While this is going on, Lord Asriel seeks to protect his daughter and prepares to face the Authority. All this action is slowed down by Dr. Mary Malone's journey to the beautiful and peaceful world of the mulefa, and her remarkable and disturbing discoveries there. With each new page, old mysteries are resolved and new ones are raised. But Pullman manages to tie each string down to its final place by the end of the book, a progession so exciting, so tender, and so heart-wrenching it will leave you in tears and in awe. In all my 16 years I have never read a book equal to this in beauty, and I don't believe I shall ever encounter one that matches it. I highly reccommend this book to any person above the age of 12.

1478953470|5|The twists and turns in this book kept me entertained. It was classic Michael Connelly. I enjoyed the book and look forward to the next book in this series.
B000003TA4|1|It's this garbage that was passed off as music. Kurt nobrain is proof that abortions arent a bad thing. This crap also proves that payola does exist. Theres no way that this junk would get played if it wasnt for the dj's being payed off. My only regret is that I wasnt able to kill nobrain myself!! Burn in hell,LOSER!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5|I love this game!!!!! I was unhappy when the kindle did not have this game but since they finally have it I play on it where ever whenever. I want. I give this game two thumbs up!! get this game.
B0051ANPZQ|4|A very special book with many lessons on many levels. All of the relationships were real life among kids and extraordinary within the family.Very easy read since the author wants young people to read this. Don't let that turn you away - it is worth the time.
B00TU9UFTS|4|Great ideas and visuals.  A quality piece.  Yep, big plot holes...  but ultimately the joy of watching something sci-fi that at least presents an original theme overrides all the negatives, especially given a reality based on Marvel sequels.
B00SI7GCJK|4|Different and very interesting film. Not my usual cup of tea, but very unique story with a very unique plot and ending.
B00A9V2JSG|5|I loved this book! Some people say that it was too slow and nothing much was happening, but I LOVED it! It was perfect. And even though nothing HUGE was happening for the first half of the book, you still want to keep reading. I recommend this book to anyone 10-any age! I got this at the library because I wasn't sure I was going to like it, so now I have to buy the book, its that good! If you liked Hunger Games or Divergent, your going to LOVE this!!
B00CY1JUW2|5|Alright in my opinion I think this is the best QOTSA album yet!  If you haven't heard this CD and like any of their past stuff you should check this out!
B0059XTV4Y|2|The story of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is a fascinating one. Even as they passed through The King's Speech in a supporting storyline(played then by Guy Pearce and Eve Best), the idea of a monarch giving up his throne to be with his multi-divorced, American socialite lover is the stuff storybook romances are made of. Madonna, who co-wrote the script and makes her first feature directorial effort since 2008's Filth and Wisdom(which nobody saw and for good reason), clearly sees something of herself in Wallis, a woman who to the very lenient was an innocent bystander as the American paparazzi skewered her on a regular basis. More critical eyes will note Wallis' guile and opportunistic nature in all things, but most obviously in how she used her charms to woo her way into the upper echelons of society, even if it meant thrusting England into a constitutional crisis at a time when it could least afford it. The various interpretations of Simpson and Edward's scandalous affair is part of what makes them so intriguing, but Madonna has no interest in exploring any of that, content only with the thinnest representation as possible.<br /><br />Yet, Madonna's decision to present such an idealized view of Wallis(Andrea Riseborough) and Edward(James D'arcy), the future King of England, would have been tolerable if not for the questionable way in which she chooses to tell it. Divided into two separate but connecting stories, one set in 1998 and following poor Wally Winthrop(Abbie Cornish), the beleaguered wife of an arrogant but highly successful doctor. Essentially a trophy wife, Wally endures his emotional and physical abuse, even as she struggles to get pregnant through a series of fertility injections. Finding an emotional void in her life, Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward, which she sees as the perfect fairy tale romance. Unable to resist hovering around a collection of their personal belongings up for auction, she looks for answers to her own problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).<br /><br />Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past. The best way to explain it is that she had an overabundance of artistic energy and no idea how to harness it, as some of her flourishes make no sense. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's shooting a biopic or a bad commercial for blue jeans or perfume. The confusion is amplified by an oddly selected soundtrack, especially when a drug fueled party thrown by Wallis and Edward roars to life accompanied by the Sex Pistols.<br /><br />Even if some of the creative choices are bizarre, at least the historical segments have some flair to them. The present day scenes are a crashing bore and shot in as flat a tone as possible. Abbie Cornish, usually such a firecracker on screen, is helpless against the bland cinematography and silly, melodramatic script. There has scarcely been a love more dull than that of Wally and her all too perfect Russian guard who comes off a little stalkerish as he watches her anxiously through the security cameras.<br /><br />Wallis was treated pretty shabbily in The King's Speech, but Andrea Riseborough tries to give her a touch more depth despite not having much to work with on the writing front. We see Wallis' intensity and devotion to the man she loves, even as she knows she'll be forever hated for taking the King away from his people. D'arcy is forgettable as Edward, especially when compared to Guy Pearce's previous charismatic turn. It's really unfortunate that this film had to come out in the wake of the 2010 Best Picture winner, because it's impossible not to compare, and when done so W.E. is found to be severely lacking.wn problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).<br /><br />Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past.

B002Y0TGOU|4|As a casual star trek fan, I loved this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is great cool the more u play the more money you win for more games you cant best that.
B00006AW2E|5|This was the Rolling Stones' third UK album.  A different version of the album was released as the group's fourth [[ASIN:B00006AW2S US album]].  This UK version features eight covers of R&B and R&R songs, plus four Stones originals.  This is really great stuff.  It should be noted that while the CD is labeled \\"Stereo\\", it is actually in mono.
B00DRPVE3M|4|Great game.  Love the tournament's.  Frequently lose tokens and boosts when the game is looking for players.  That can be very frustrating since it can take a while to build those up.
B000VDDDVO|5|Everyone likes this movie.  I am guessing my wife likes the idea that we will watch it on DVD since she ordered it.
1936891026|2|I can relate to this book a little, in that I come across resistance on my path to getting stuff done...but there's nothing here of any substance other than acknowledging resistance and discussing that it's there. And that you have to break through it. The type is large, there are a lot of partial pages. This is more like a booklet than a helpful book. I feel like I've delayed getting to work even more having taken the time to read this. The title is about what the inside contains...just in more words on the soft paper. It's not necessarily HOW to break through the blocks, just talking about them being there.
B001JIFYSA|5|Actually LOVED this movie! Friends have been saying I had to watch it. So glad I did. It's terrific! It's a keeper for sure!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love to play this game and so does my grandchilderen. I am glad it is on my kindle. wish pet saga was.
B005QYKE2Y|5|Great Movie, Great Price, Blu-Ray
B009HELT3C|5|5 star
B000HSKUBE|5|fantastic.  watch the u.s. version first.  but then the british version is equally fascinating.
B00AQA94M4|2|Has a bad editing actions for the cd lectures of any music device, the title or the name of the album it can´t be readed completely.
B00003CY5H|3|From the previews, THE SCORE, starring Robert De Niro and Edward Norton as the main characters, looks like a fast-paced action film filled with the intrigue and suspense that accompanies movies dealing with robberies and heists. The plot itself was strong and had the potential to be outstanding, but soon into the film it became clear that not even the likes of De Niro or Norton could save it from its own predictability. Being a dedicated fan of both of these talented actors, I did enjoy this film. On the other hand, I noticed that I was able to predict nearly every upcoming event. Brando had no true use in the film, (likewise for Bassett). It seemed as though both roles were irrelevent to the storyline. Out of a possible five stars, I give THE SCORE a 3.0. I also recommend this film for fans of both Norton and De Niro, but I must say that this movie is not among the best works for either of them.
0345410025|5|In medical school right now and the concepts in this book work (peg, link, substitute word), and get better the more you use them!  Thank you so much Mr. Lorayne and Mr. Lucas!
B004Y1WCDE|5|Wonderfull i love this model
B00005QB9A|5|I saw this movie just last night on cable and I was thoroughly blown away. Tim Roth's portrayal of the tragic pianist 1900 is breath taking. A man with an limitless innate gift for playing piano who can't bear to leave the ship he calls home. The duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton was for me the highpoint of the piece. Just beautiful.
B0063IH60K|4|I have to playing a few hands every night. Helps me relax. I like that I can change the background.
B004LOMB2Q|5|This application hits the sweet spot of. being flexible and very useful. For me it's  indispensable. It's now integrated into my personal and professional workflow.
B0091REZMW|5|Wonderful gave I love it.  It has so many different quests to keep you interested and continually gives you new things.  After playing game for 1&amp; half yrs I truelly enjoy it. What I don't is all the problems I have had with the game loading and freezing and the help you don't receive from GI. To add to that gi has recently helped me restore my game, even tho it was their issues that caused it to be deleted.
B006OCM0G0|1|I had fun until I went and visited neighbor. Then I couldn't get back to my store. I will try reinstalling it but only once.
B00I2TV3NO|4|Love  the series
B00E9E4EC8|3|I don't normally like bluegrass and this album is strictly that.
B000QCS8TW|5|I honestly can't decide if I like the book or the show better, they are both so remarkably well put together
1579129129|5|Awsome book - gives me lots of ideas for sculptural forms.
B005SE9W9I|5|One of the best seasons, of one of the best shows on tv of all time. This is a must-see!
B00HTJMHI8|5|love it
B009UX2YAC|3|Well it gets addicting but after a while you get bored and you kinda forget about it but it was fun to play it while it lasted
B001JNNDAQ|2|The French Connection was and remains an immensely entertaining cops and drug smugglers film.  The movie is probably best remembered for Gene Hackman's manic car chase, during which Hackman appears to be oblivious to both his own safety and that of the citizens of the densely populated city he is sworn to protect. However spectacular that scene may have been, it was far down the list of the film's best moments. These come, ironically, in the slower scenes, such as the unauthorized stakeout during which Popeye and his partner doggedly pursue evidence against a suspected small time drug dealer.  All in all, the film is an excellent portrayal of the gritty, dirty world of drug law enforcement.    That's the good news.  The bad news is that the print quality of the blu-ray disk is virtually indistinguishable in most scenes from a standard definition DVD.  Worse, in some places (Particularly the night and low light scenes)the added definition of blu-ray actually seems to emphasize the graininess and soft focus of the film.  In short it's a great movie but an inferior blu-ray product.
1416583408|2|I expected to love this book. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired.    First, there is surprisingly little information in it. The author touches on each subject so briefly that only the most superficial observations can be made. Dog body language gets maybe two pages and includes such revelations as the meaning of a tucked tailed (discomfort and/or submission). Is there a dog owner in the world who doesn't already know that? Note: if that's new to you and you own a dog, stop reading this review and find a dog trainer immediately. In the 250 pages I managed to read, I found two things of interest: the description of canine vision, and speculation on a potential flaw in experiments on dog intelligence (to wit: dogs know that humans are great providers of food, so if a dog that gives up on the puzzle in front of him and runs over to the researcher for help, maybe he's being smart, not dumb).     Second, the author spends way too much time bemoaning human chauvinism. Apparently, all research into animal behavior is done to shore up our belief that humans are the rightful masters of the earth.     Third, the tone of this book is insistently, forcibly whimsical. Sometimes it hits the right note, and I did find myself laughing out lot a few times, particularly at an anecdote about a doberman put to work guarding a collection of valuable teddy bears. Unfortunately, it's more often grating, and I found myself rolling my eyes at the little vignettes about the author's dog that start every chapter. It truly pains me to write that, as love between a dog and an owner is such a wonderful thing.     Fourth, the text has some odd contradictions, one which is noted by the reviewer below me. The author also starts one chapter raving about dogs' almost preternatural ability to understand our intentions -- and supports this assertion by noting how easy it is to fool a dog into thinking you've thrown a tennis ball.    Finally, I came to the point where I had to put the book down. The author begins to describe dogs' sense of personal space, which she gets almost entirely wrong. She makes a common mistake in saying that dogs have a much smaller radius of personal space than we do. This may be true of ultra-friendly, well-socialized dogs like many retrievers, but it is *not* the norm. Dogs are in fact extremely concerned with personal space, and much of what we know about their communication involves conveying the boundaries of their \\"bubbles\\".    The final straw was here: \\"Repeating itself on sidewalks across the country is a scene that demonstrates the clash of our sense of personal space: the sight of two dog owners as they stand six feet apart, straining to keep their leashed dogs from touching, while the dogs strain mightily to touch each other. Let them touch!\\" This is horribly bad advice. There are a thousand reasons why two strange dogs should not be allowed to greet each other unrestrainedly, first and foremost that lunging towards another dog is actually very aggressive behavior. Dogs have a plethora of signals indicating that their interest is respectful, including look aways, medium-to-low tail carriage, and a sideways approach. A dog that jumps straight up into another dog's business is socially inept at best, and intending harm at worst.    Instead of this book, I would recommend almost anything by Temple Grandin (who isn't always right either, but has a fascinating perspective), Turid Rugaas, Karen Pryor, or Brenda Aloff.
B002I9Z8I0|5|Received Earlier Then Expected. Now for the Movies, If your a Star Trek Fan, this is the perfect box set, of Startrek, Original Motion Pictures #1 through #6. I also enjoyed the Bonus Disc. Whoopi Goldberg Sitting down with The Original Startrek Stars & Next Generation Star's. Thumbs Up or Beam Up !
B00AMBLXP8|2|Seriously not worth the time. I kept hoping it would improve, but it just decended further and further into \\"potty talk\\" for grown-ups. Who needs it? I finally turned it off and found something more intelligent to do with my time.
B004G7UTXG|5|Timeless piece about sin and redemption with stunning visuals.  De Niro as a warrior monk is both believable and powerful, a must see.
B00A0NOF7G|5|Killer Cupcakes is a fun, light cozy mystery that should delight any reader looking for a casual read.  The characters are fun, the mystery is interesting - all the right elements for a pleasant reading experience.
B009KS4XRO|4|really like game but hate the trash talk in chat rooms. some times i have a little trouble with game .
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great way to stream movies, youtube or your favorite site online from your computer to your TV - I would recommend this product to anyone
B00VRYCGLO|5|Enjoyable game
B00BAXFECK|5|The Goldfinch is not the normal genre that I tend to read... I generally go for suspense, crime fiction.... Lisa Gardner, Karin Slaughter, Tami Hoag, etc.  After reading the NY Times review as well as of the of The goldfinch, I had to pick it up.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it! I would read pages any chance that I had. Tartt's detail and beautifully wrought descriptions of everythi9ng n the book was a joy to read!
B0000DJZ7W|5|I have all Celine's albums since 1990 but this is one of my favourites! Its her best since 1997 ''lets talk about love''multi-million seller.If you know french or not it doesn't matter here, the songs are so good and her voice sounds so nice that you will love it ! great songs are ''le vol d'un ange'',''tu nages'' , ''je lui dirai'',''mon homme'',''contre nature'' ,'' des milliers de baisers'' and the most AMAZING french song she has ever done ''RIEN N&quot;EST VRAIMENT FINI''- its musicality you can feel it! It comes from the heart! I could go on about how good the album is but buy it and see you will love it! Unfortunatelly the album did not sell well in the Uk (due to a lack of promotion also) - just to show how bad the music industry is at the moment - this is a masterpiece!Forget about her last 2 albums ---- Believe me this is Celine's best french album so far!
B00FATEJYE|5|Yes<br />It is.
B00008H2LB|5|Hybrid Theory alone went platinum 14 times, quite a lot had to happen in order for LP to follow up.  It seems that they succeeded in that.  The cd is a LOT harder than Hybrid Theory.  The only problem with the cd is that it sounds a lot like their first cd.  Which in reality, isn't a problem at all.  If you thought their first cd was too soft, definatly try this one out for size, because all of the songs on the cd are much harder than any on Hybrid.  Just a note: Numb sounds very close to &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; only different lyrics and music, listen to both of them very closely (Especially Chester) and you'll see what I mean.
B00AZMFK3K|4|enjoyable
B004GJDQT8|5|Love amazon. Have never had an issue.
B007SOQBCM|5|No complaints
B00M856DSS|5|Hozier is a poet! Can't stop listening to this CD!
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I freaked when the new update came OMG OMG I knew because someone told me on pixelgun :) I recommend it for all ages
B003Y5H5F6|5|Underworld: Awakening is my favorite of the four movies in the series thus far. The CGI looks great and there is more action than the all the other films combined. If you want blood filled action, you'll pretty much get it from start to finish. The story is okay, with a couple of twists that caught me by surprise, and the acting is good for this type of film. The beyond gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stills rocks the role of Selene. I really hope she comes back for a fifth installment.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D was not really worth the upgrade, but I had no choice at my theater. The sound was great, even making the seats shake, but at least the 3-D wasn't a blurry mess that took away from the movie.<br /><br />Now my 5 star rating is in context with the Underworld series, not comparable say to my 5 star review of The Dark Knight. If you like the series I don't see any reason you wouldn't love this one.
B0060MYM3S|5|..even great as a tv series!! I recommend the series to anyone interested in kingdom-time type fiction. From my memory, the series does a good job following and summarizing the books.
0143124544|4|Have enjoyed all of her books that I have read-Three
B00081U6EG|5|I tried to be at Wembley for the show but I didn't make it. I waited for this DVD and I am NOT dissapointed! It was worth the wait! If you have any interest in pop/rock music then there is something in this for you. Some of the greats of the last 50years are featured. The sound is excellent although the audiences sound level could have been increased to give it more of a live feel. I would highly recommend this DVD
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Enjoy playing it's lots of fun the family loves playing
B003WUYRGI|1|We're going to b e together  forever. So when he's not going to be there with her. So until she waiting for her husband.

B0050BPIB0|5|I bought this CD from Amazon because in my country I couldn't find it....Pablo is just an excelent artist his voice has made me fall in love with him in each song...you should buy a copy of this CD  because I'm pretty sure his career will last lots of time!
B0086700CM|5|this game is awesome. would like to make it to the cave someday.love the different people you earn with coins.would like more speed.when you jump in the air would like more of the speed guys and coin collections.this is a fun game.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Excellent series.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|this app is intersetins and has a n amazing perspective yet it has its flaws and I honestly think you should get it.
B00009W0U4|5|&quot;Irreversible&quot; is one of the most violent and cruel films I have ever seen.  The rape scene is brutally honest, shot in one long eight minute take without interruption, and the beating at the beginning is so graphic you feel as if the camera is participating in the violence, rising and falling with the blunt instrument.<BR>    And yet, because of the films honesty, it becomes a film that does not at all condone violence.  Instead, it seems to demonstrate it's unnecessary existence in society as it completely destroys two lives, seemingly bound to this destiny by fate as the movie is told in reverse.<BR>    Brilliant, althought unwatchable to most.
B00LXLM05I|5|the game is deep enough even with free play to keep you engaged for hours.  it is fun and the gradual difficulty increase in the free version should appeal to almost all casual players.  I find it sometimes difficult to see arounf environmental object but that is a fairly minor point thus far.  note this review is 5 stars because is a solid gamw but I did get gems for in game use for the review in the interest olof full disclosure.  but I would have rated ir 4 or 5 without that incentive.
B00AREIAI8|5|I like this game especially when you have to groom your horse this would be a good game for anyone who wants to be a horse owner
B0000064TT|5|i admit I don't know much about this band or its members, but I've heard a few of their albums...and this is my favorite!  i'm glad I finally got this on cd.  I love instrumental rock and jazz fusion.  and this band does a wonderful job of dancing between both styles with a fine mastery of progressive rock and the added spice of southern rock and country (which is the prerogative of a band from Dixie).  southern rock/country is not a common element in jazz fusion, so the influence used by this band is welcome and refreshing.  the musicians are all gifted, inspired and creative.  I've seen reviews claiming guitarist steve morse has won all sorts of awards and polls for being the greatest guitarist in the world.  although I've heard nothing from this group that would support that claim, morse is a man of impressive and admirable talent in both writing and playing.  violinist allen sloan is well versed in classical, rock, jazz and prog-rock...and as a big jean-luc ponty fan, I can admit i'm very impressed.  the compositions and performances of all band members throughout this entire album are unique and remarkable.  i'm very glad to give this wonderful album a deserved five-star rating.  and any fan of instrumental rock, jazz fusion and prog-rock should add this disc to their collection.
B00ESNDQWY|3|Both my wife and I enjoyed thoroughly Seasons 1 through 4, however Season 5 was a major letdown to us. The rhythm of the story line has become hectic, leaving little time for the character development and story telling that was so well controlled before. Then teh story line has gone downhill. Separation of the 4th year associates from the main law firm was messy - very poorly handled, unethical, morally questionable, and mostly ridiculous - as the 4th year associates have no more wisdom than a squirrel.... This set up a very low expectation for the new law firm of Florrick-Agos, putting Alicia's character on shaky ground. To top this, the producers killed off the most likeable character in the series, Will Gardner - which effectively pulled the carpet from under the entire series. What we're left with is a very narrow focus on personal vendettas and minor squabbles played over the heads of their clients. Very little of the magic from the first seasons is left standing.... no more interesting (and intelligent) trial strategies, character development is frozen (poor Cary Agos's character was never developed, he continues to be portrayed as a fresh graduate, with minor roles), and the moral bearings of Alicia & team is consistently questionable. Not to mention, has anyone noticed that every time instead of going home to spend some time with her kids, she prefers a casual late evening drink at an upscale bar... It looks like the show script was hijacked by some insecure, frustrated late developer... What a shame.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love the game but you need to buy gems with real money and you need to buy them a lot.
B000002518|5|Odd how many of the collection-fillers purchased recently have been from the mid-1970's.  One thing about really good music is that it is not tied tightly to a particular time.  My vinyl record (remember those?) is one big scratch at this point, so it was time for a CD.<br />Peckinpah's film is infamous in its own way for showing up at different theaters in different versions - quite literally edited with different scenes in different places.  Now this has settled to a director's cut (103 minutes with everything in the order Sam Peckinpah wanted), a chopped and sanitzed version for broadcast, and the random versions still floating around of alternative cuttings.  So it was left to Bob Dylan, along with Byron Berline and Sundance, to provide a consistent and thematic assurance to the audiences of varying versions.  In Berline's &quot;Turkey Run&quot;, the music tells you the gang is racing around on horses, chasing wild turkeys.  In the hit &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot; one knows there is a noble death impending; on the screen this understated scene is amplified mightily in emotional impact by Dylan's song.  Even the recurrent simple guitar riffs are pleasant.  <br />This is also one of the great rush-hour albums.  Pop it on during that horrendous hour-long commute on the 405, and spend the time on a dusty ranch in the Old West; the gritty and realistic old West as portrayed in the film.  Good schtuff!
0451167716|5|Amazing.  It gave a lot more back story than the movie, and brought a lot of the movie into a deeper perspective.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great read!  What an amazing story.
B0067R0APK|3|The old version was easier to use.  Since the update I find the use of ease is not as friendly.  Too much swiping and scrolling.  I'll be using my other weather app now.
B008Y2FRFO|5|Nice fun program my daughter and son both enjoy playing the game. I would recommend this game to any one with young kids
B00BAXFECK|5|LOVED this book. A long read, but engaging throughout.
B00KQR1G3M|5|I don't really know what to say on music reviews. Of course I am a fan that is why I bought the cd.  So in a review I could go on and on about how I love the band but that tells no one anything about the product. The sleeve is cardboard, has a nice picture in the middle when you open it up, the lyrics are printed on a booklet inside.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are amazing to me and I am not disappointed one tiny bit in any of the songs on the cd. My personal favorite is Fault lines which Mike Campbell helped write. All other is written by Tom . I have listened to this repeatedly since I got it and I tend to do that with all my music but I do buy very little, I am only going to spend my money on purchasing what I truly think moves me and I am connected with. To me, this particular cd of theirs shows such wisdom, they have changed through the ages but to me that is great. I experience absolute brilliance when I turn on TPATH's.  I do indeed LOVE this band.  Please give this cd a listen, request the songs, go enjoy a concert :) You won't be disappointed. This is a great band and a great album. ** I just noticed I wrote the CD review on the mp3 purchases. I did get both. I had three or four songs on mp3 downloaded before the album came out. So to note the mp3 part--- All downloaded well, good quality, no problems and good price. All in all, both the mp3 files I purchased and the CD itself are worth getting :)
B00003CXSP|3|I would go straight to the point : in the Book, Crawford appears ; in the Book Thomas Harris explains why Lecter became cannibal and it is related to Lecter's childhood and his little sister Misha; what about the Palace of the mind?; in the Book there is Mason Verger's sister who teams with Barney; AND OVERALL IN THE BOOK THE ENDING IS 180 DEGREES OPPOSITE TO BOTH ENDINGS OF THE DVD AND THE THEATRICAL RELEASE : I cannot describe the ending, read the book, it is suprisingly incredible. Why change it totally in the movie, MY GOD !!!.
B00AAQRNQ8|4|Good mouse for photo/video editing. I got this for my Brother-in-law who is a photoshop guru but he always buys low-end crappy electronics and he had to admit that a gaming mouse makes his workflow MUCH faster and more efficient. Glad i got it for him. probably deserves 5 stars but we'll see how long it lasts.
B00F8L2VO4|1|Did not find it useful
B002ZG97E2|5|Saw this in the Theater with a friend who is more of a \\"see it on DVD\\" kinda gal... We both agreed we'd go back and see it again and again.  Difficult to feel sad or bored during this movie. I am not one to get sucked in to a movie about poor little kids, but was cheering for them at the end and LOVED it all. Steve Carell and Russell Brand were brilliant and Julie Andrews as \\"Gru's\\" Mom was a Dysfunctional FUN role as well. Jason Segal continues to amaze me with his versatility and timing.  Great job. Wished I had seen it in 3D but friend could not do that. Good sequence during the Credits at the end of the film.  Good for kids and adults both.  Pixar did it again. Can't wait to \\"gift\\" this to a few friends.  Enjoy!!!
B00687Q0VC|5|Thoroughly enjoyed the series.  The actors were remarkable and the history very well delivered!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I love this book, very nice & interesting to read. It won't bore you, the more you read the more it gets interesting & wouldn't want to stop reading it. One of the best books i've read so far.
B0083Z614S|5|I first read this book when I was about 9 or 10 and instantly fell in love with the characters and the setting. An uplifting story of overcoming heartbreak with valuable life lessons sprinkled in like so many fragrant flowers in the sumptuous Secret Garden.
B000WMFZMY|5|The Cid was just a cog in the wheel of wealth and power.  He did not let that power and wealth corrupt him.  He did not answer to the politically popular beliefs of his time.  The Cid had principles and his allies and enemies grew to respect him even when they did not agree with him.  He fought and died for what he believed in and in so doing became a legend:  &#34;The Cid&#34;.  At the time a title of &#34;El Cid&#34; was an honor conferred on someone who both enemy and friend respected and who did not bow to the political whims of his day. Unlike today's politicians, he was a man of his word.
B00DR0PDNE|5|We could not get this on our home wireless for some reasons, so mu husband took it to school where he teachers science.  The following is his review:<br /><br />  &#34;I plugged this into the HDMI port on my projector. Connected it to the faculty network and was able to screen cast from a chrome book, a mac laptop, a kindle fire, and my android phone.  (Anything that can run chrome browser with the chromecast plugin).  As a science teacher this was an excellent tool.  I can cast to the screen from anywhere in the room, or actually anywhere in the school (as long as i am on the same network).<br />At one point during a lab, I used my kindle and the camera. When one lab group has a great &#34;find&#34; or reaction, I can project an image or video live to the screen for the whole class to see.<br />  In short, this was a very effective way to teach and project power point, and other lesson info from anywhere in the class.<br />Hardly any lag, videos worked great with sound as well.  (Occasional lag casting youtube)  You can select to cast entire screen, or single tab.&#34;

B00IYAG7DM|5|I love this game. It is incredibly fun and addicting with real depth to the gameplay and card evolution. I've been playing non stop for the past few weeks and even though the game does have microtransactions, you can definitely play without spending any real money. I highly recommend this.
B00821OX98|5|I was very impressed with how well this series took such an off-the-wall idea and did it very well.
B00ILHW6AG|4|For an author that has written well over 50 novels, Stephen King is in the midst of a remarkable career renaissance in which his most recent works compare favorably to the best works in his distinguished library. I rated this novel four stars. Though for certain any other author would possibly haveRevival as their best effort. Revival features Charlie Jacobs as its antagonist, an erstwhile preacher, who has an obsession with electricity. Charlie's role and motivations change throughout the book.  He remains an entirely sympathetic character.  Charlie crosses paths with the protagonist Jamie, who is a young boy at the time. Over the years, and through various family tragedies, and addictions - substance abuse and dark electricity - Charlie and Jamie's lives will continue to intersect over the course of the following decades.<br /><br />Stephen King continues to paint vivid portraits of the characters in his books. Some characters serve as main players throughout his novel, while others make brief yet memorable appearances. Covering  a 50 - year time frame, this novel is not a continual horror fest rather the suspense and horror slowly build over the course of the book. Revival has numerous themes to include religion, addiction and recovery, second chances, and questions at what cost do wishes come true.<br /><br />There is really no proper way to categorize a Stephen King novel other than it is a Stephen King novel. This is totally different than Stephen King's most recent novel Mr. Mercedes - which was a murder mystery. This just reaffirms Stephen King's place among the greatest of American authors. It is safe to say, that after a brief period of - in my opinion - a few forgettable novels that came out before to Duma Key, Stephen King has not only hit his stride but has regained his momentum. Let us hope that his writing career continues its Revival.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I needed to find some up beat music, I know e has good music heard one of his songs on the radio and ran out and got the cd.the lyrics are brutal but beats are great!  I listen to when working-out and keeps my mind focus on the reason about some things.    I give it a thumbs up...

I was late for work this morning because I just couldn't lay down my Kindle until I finished this wonderful story.
B004LWZW4C|5|Sometimes comic book movies don't take the hint.  Superman should have stopped after two.  The original Batman movies should have stopped after one.  The Fantastic Four should have stopped the minute Jessica Alba was cast.  But leave it to X-Men to finally get it right after 5 tries.<br /><br />Not that the first four movies were bad.  X-Men 1 and 2 are actually decent.  Wolverine is campy, but still fun.  X-Men 3 barely survives Kelsey Grammer in a fuzzy blue gorilla suit.  But X-Men First Class is in a, uh, category of its own.<br /><br />There are a few reasons why it works so well.  Good action, fun characters, jokes, a couple awesome cameos.  But I think the biggest reason is that it is set in the 60s.  No Austin Powers here (though January Jones as Emma Frost does a pretty great impression of a Fem-bot).  This is Cold War all the way.  This can lead to some anachronistic moments.  After leaving their cutting edge genetics lab on a futuristic hover jet, the X-Men are forced to watch JFK give updates on a static black-and-white television.<br /><br />Still, it's awesome to have a real president overseeing these things for once.  Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, the filmmakers recast a chess match between superpowers as a chess match between super powers.  The U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. may have their differences, but pretty much everyone agrees that Kevin Bacon is pure evil.<br /><br />Bacon plays the mutant villain Sebastian Shaw, whose main super power is that he can link himself to any movie actor in six movies or less.  He can also absorb energy.  This makes him pretty much unstoppable, except for one weak point, and it has nothing to do with his bushy sideburns (Kevin Bacon can rock smarmy facial hair like nobody's business).  It's up to Magneto and Professor X to find his Achilles Heel and exploit it.<br /><br />Yes, Magneto and Professor X are a team in this movie, and while it doesn't exactly culminate with a lightsaber battle on Mustafar, you know it can't end well.  This is a far more violent movie then we're used to from X-Men.  Comic book movies tend to involve lots of action, but rarely do you grasp the damage to human life.  X-Men First Class isn't gory, but it does have some brutal murders.  Most of them involve Magneto, whose ability to rip fillings from other people's teeth and thrust knives into their chests from across the room makes him a little unsettling.  Another mutant can grab hold of average people and teleport them a mile into the sky.  Then he drops them.  This is a far cry from the horrors of Superman II, where the biggest danger was in having your bus tip over.<br /><br />There's a dark side even to the good guys, and many of the mutants are not above using their sexuality as a manipulation tactic.  Angel makes a living as an exotic dancer.  Emma Frost has no problem telepathically simulating a make-out session.  Even the non-mutant CIA officer strips down to her underwear to sneak into a nightclub.  Give Mystique some credit.  Whereas everyone just assumed that Rebecca Romijn would give her performance sans clothes, Jennifer Lawrence (as the younger version) at least feels uncomfortable walking around in full blue nakedness.  Let's face it, when even Professor X is dropping the same genetic-theme pick-up line on every hottie at the bar, you've definitely crossed into new X-Men territory.<br /><br />If the movie falters anywhere, it's in bringing back that ridiculous blue gorilla suit.  Nicholas Hoult's character undergoes a transformation from a guy with big feet to The Beast, later (earlier) played by Kelsey Grammer.  While some comic book costumes look good on screen, this one is never gonna work.  He looks like a werewolf smurf, and might better off chasing Gargamel's cat through a magical candy forest.  A better solution would have been to show the beginnings of Beast's transformation, then to have him flee the movie out of shame, which would have been entirely within character.<br /><br />All told, X-Men First Class has catapulted itself to the upper echelon of comic book movies, into the heady space occupied by Dark Knight and Iron Man.  It does make one wonder if they will quit while they're ahead.  I'd hate to see this turn into X-Men Saved by the Bell.to the upper echelon of comic book movies, into the heady space occupied by Dark Knight and Iron Man.

B000IYU9HW|2|It is a nice story but, it should be rated R for language and sex scenes.<br />It is not a family movie.

B006XBSAP2|5|I'm a generation older than Ms. Perry but greatly admire her work and love her voice.<br />I grew up listening to classic rock, R & B, funk and disco but also loved the pop that<br />came out of the 80s so was drawn to her addictive hooks and great melodies.<br />The lyrics are not for the faint of heart....the language is very adult and quite fun....but<br />not for young children. I've had the CD in my car for days now and can't stop singing.<br />For me the last three songs on the CD are dispensable....the rest of the record utterly<br />listenable and a damn good time!
068987474X|2|Ladies,<br /><br />Even though the book does make some decent points here and there, I really hope you will not make it into any kind of \\"live by\\" code.  According to the authors, any time a guy takes a little too long to make a move, or take it to the next level, or does not call you all the time, or you're not having enough sex, its all because he's not that into you. Well you just took 80% of the guys off your list.  And the only ones left are the ones that know the game in and out, have no problem picking up women and probably have no intentions for a long term relationship anyway.  In short exactly the types you are trying to avoid.<br /><br />The author Greg gives an example that he calls his wife 4 times a day because he can't live without her, and if your guy doesn't call you all the time to tell you he loves you then he's just not that into you.  Are you kidding me??????  First of all, not all guys are the mushy sensitive types and a lot of us just do not enjoy talking on the phone about nothing.  That does NOT mean they are not into you.  Second, it's ok to call your wife 4 times a day, but if you will call a girl that you are just interested in, or just started going out with 4 times a day, you give out a vibe of a clingy, jealous, controlling mess waiting to happen to say the least.<br /><br />Another thing I want the women to keep in mind is 50% of guys don't really know what the hell they are doing. While you are there with your girlfriends analyzing his every move, there is not really much to analyze.  You are asking yourself why he didn't call yet, while we're being told by books for guys and by our friends not to call the next day because she will think you are too needy (see the problem here?).  So no, its not that I am not into you, its just I am trying to navigate this mine field called dating world without taking a wrong step and blowing it with a girl I really like.<br /><br />The book does not really offer any advice to women that send questions and stories (I am not sure if those stories are real).  Paraphrased story: \\"I went out with a man, slept with him but he never called me back even though he said he would.  Is something wrong with me?\\"  Answer by Greg: \\"No, he's just not that into you.  Keep looking because there is that perfect man out there somewhere who will love you and appreciate you for the hot stuff that you are\\"  Mmm, how about telling the truth so she knows exactly what's going on. I'm sure a reply like this would give her a better insight into where she's going wrong \\"Yes sweetie, it is you.  How about next time you wait until the third or fourth date to sleep with a guy and see if that helps.\\"<br /><br />I think that women might get a distorted picture about men from this book.  Yes, some obvious common sense signs should be always looked for to realize when the guy is not into you, but in most cases give a guy a break and a benefit of a doubt.<br /><br />Yes may be he is actually busy and not just saying that because he doesn't want to see you.  Yes may be he did just got out a bad relationship and wants to take it slow. And no, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman asking a guy out; its your life, would you just rather just wait around until a guy you like asks you out or just come up to him and ask him if he would like to get a cup of coffee sometime and see what happens.<br /><br />I really don't think that a comedian (Greg) and a 45+ years old woman who has never been married in her life (Liz) are qualified experts on relationships.  When Liz was asked in an online interview why she's still single she said \\"I guess because I haven't met the right person yet.\\"  I'm sure writing off every guy that does not perform to the standards of your \\"code\\" might have something to do with it.those stories are real).

6305169187|1|The only possible disaster worse than this movie is the one it depicts.  Glittery big-budget nonsense with just enough character development to fill a thimble.  Do yourself a favor.  Watch Nova instead.
0393317552|5|I would like to praise Guns Germs and Steel on several aspects.<br />First, as everybody quite agrees on, GGS lays a logical framework for the history of the human species. (second) Diamond wrests this enormous task with seeming ease, although it is obvious that he thoroughly criticised his ideas before writing them down. But we don't read the mind bendings and difficult times he had while doing this self-criticism: we just read the end product, the points he makes, what he accepts, what he refuses. It is as if he wrote a volume that was several times larger than GGS and then he took only the notconfusing crystallized ideas and put into GGS.<br />His writing style is excellent. He is not self indulgent in using excessive grammar and handsome vocabulary. Even at the most colorful instances in human history he narrates, he doesn't get carried away in the language he uses.<br />At all chapters, I felt the presence of an author who really thought on the issues he tells, never conceals the facts, never tries to find ways around.<br />The main idea of the book is awesome, and this is much glorofied anyway (for good reason). I am more struck by the fact that a content this complex and this overwhelming is given in such a good structure. What I observe in myself is while reading a science book, even if I admire the book, when it's finished all I have is an impression of the book and a few examples that I remember. On the contrary, after I finished GGS I found myself talking about the main idea of the book to people for hours. GGS achieves this by the amazing simplicity of its language, its unpretentious style and its repetitions. Yes, repetitions, which is normally regarded as drawbacks becomes a way to make the reader really understand the idea. Certainly, repetitions are not mere repetitions but the main ideas repeated in different contexts. In this aspect, the seemingly high volume of the book also doesn't become an issue because of the ease of reading it.
0345803485|2|I gave it a chance, I murmured. I really did, I muttered to myself. I pursed my lips: Holy crap! I thought...why am I wasting time on this book? It's so freaking bad!
B0054R6BFM|2|I was very disappointed in this book. Such potential but the 13 reasons why she committed suicide were really... Well.. Not well thought out.
1423165691|5|Beautiful book, awesome texture, worths every penny
B0084AXZK0|5|There's not much to be said in reviewing such a classic book. I love Wilde's work very much and I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this. it's amazing how modern and current it feels given when it was written.
0307341577|4|This author has a fresh prospective from what I've read in the past.  Gone Girl was the first book I read which led me to get this one.  I didn't like it quite as well, but it is a very good read.
B00BAXFECK|4|I enjoyed this book. I do feel that it did drag just a bit, the substance abuse got just a little old after so much of the book devoted to it. I'm not sure I liked the ending. Overall the book was fine.
B008220AVW|5|I am a rocker. I love THE BYRDS, HOLLY BETH VINCENT, JEFFERSON AIRPLANE, THE SEX PISTOLS, TELEVISION, TOM VERLAINE, FAIRPORT CONVENTION, RICHARD THOMPSON, LUNA, MOBY GRAPE, BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD...those may not be metal ( I like HALESTORM though), they ARE some serious rock heavies. Why would I buy a Katy Perry movie and her cds. I wish I could say it was her fabulous body, which although sexist, would be simple. The fact that she's gorgeous does not hurt, although I have no intention of seeing her live. The thing is is that her music bounces, it's fun and often makes you feel good. She sings like a rocker and not a white girl rnb imitation...damn I hate when Britney Spears does that. If Katy was doing hard rock, her voice would actually have a kind of Grace Slick quality, but she doesn't do that. She doesn't get too serious and doesn't take herself too seriously. She isn't a poet and isn't flying Eight Miles High on LSD, although those stage sets....:-)  Her voice really isn't \\"pretty\\" and has a \\"balls, or in this case t&ts to the walls\\" quality. If she wanted to go hard rock, she could, easily. That's not where she's at. \\"Wide Awake\\" shows some psychedelic moments though.<br /><br />Anyway, the film is a good biography. Don't buy it for a concert film: it isn't. You can get those a dime a dozen on bootlegs. Buy this if you want to see what kind of person she is. I doubt that she's perfect, but she doesn't come off loke some spoiled diva in here, but rather a pretty normal person. I like it and it's on my shelf flanked by THE SEX PISTOLS: THE FILTH AND THE FURY and FLY JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. What the heck...
B00BUCW54Q|4|Jack Reacher was a great movie with a lot of twist and turns. It little to much action and shooting, but comeon who doesnt love that stuff. I would recommend this to my buddies but it totally not a family movie.
B0076DELIG|5|I have read EVERY book Michael Connelly has written, and the Black Box is one of the best.  I love Harry Bosch.  As usual, I felt emotionally involved with Harry and his trials.  My only disappointment was that the LT was not held more accountable for his treatment of Harry.  Great book .. I highly recommend it.

B000XA5K4I|5|Incredible mindless action. Fun to watch from start to finish. Guns, violence and Monica Belucci, what more can you ask for?  Popcorn entertainment at its best.
0385504209|4|Let me start with a disclaimer, I'm fascinated by stories that involve the Vatican and the power of the Catholic church.  As a Catholic in the United States, I'm intrigued by the vast monetary and property holdings that the church possesses worldwide, as well as the loyalty that the church has inspired.  As an institution, you know that the Catholic church has the power to survive many scandals and crises.<br />So, if the premise of the Da Vinci code is the search for information so powerful that it has the power to reduce the mighty Vatican strucutre to rubble, I'm hooked.  Mr. Brown does a nice job of framing a thriller with monks and bishops serving as the &quot;bad guys,&quot; even though they're trying to preserve a religion.<br />My only problem with this book is the &quot;gotcha&quot; factor.  I won't give away any of the secrets, but I was annoyed by the fact that every puzzle and mystery in the book was solved by the prime characters within a few pages in some form of dazzling revelation.  If the mysteries remained buried for almost two millenium, you'd think it would take more than 36 hours for the main characters to get to the bottom of them.  Mr. Brown gets an &quot;A&quot; for his idea and a &quot;B-&quot; for the execution.

B0007P3582|1|50 Cent is simply a joke.  \\"The Massacre\\" is only his second album, and he's already got nothing to rap about.  But he's obviously still hungry for money, so what did he do?  He went pop.  This album contains some songs about guns, some garbage dance songs and the rest are all \\"I-need-you-in-my-life-baby\\" kind of songs.  It's funny how he's making exactly the type of music he dissed Ja Rule for making.  Oh, it also has that diss song \\"Piggy Bank\\" which, frankly, is weak as hell.  I can't believe 50 Cent thinks he's so good, he has the nerve to start feuds with rappers whom actually have alot to talk about, and whom have been around much longer than him.  He disses Jadakiss, Nas, Shyne, Fat Joe, Kelis, and drops even more names on that one song \\"Piggy Bank.\\"  All of these artists have responded back to him, and they can actually record entire diss songs towards him, not drop one line like he does. <br /> <br />He also kicked The Game out of G-Unit just because Game is friends with Jadakiss and Nas.  50 Cent acts like he's in elementary school.  If he knows what's good for him, he'll quit while he's behind with all these beefs.  Don't waste your money on this CD.
B006YC74E8|3|Works well good deal
B0039TD7RC|3|Note: This review is of the remastered album plus the bonus disk released in May of 2010. Amazon has cloned the reviews of earlier releases and put them in this section where they don't really apply.    Finally a remastering of one of great rock & roll albums. The original sound, like some other great albums (Physical Graffitti, Europe 72 and more) was muddy and jukeboxy, maybe intentionally so. The sound of the original album has been improved somewhat. It is still not the quality one might expect with a current release, but has been cleaned up and the individual instruments are more distinct.    Having done that, why did the Stones bother to put out a bonus disk of outakes and discarded versions? They may be of interest to scholars, but most are so awkward, half-mixed and woozy that I'd be mortified to claim them as my own. Listening to the bonus disk made me grind my teeth in agony. Better that they had put an expanded booklet in rather than this instant coaster.
B007IXWKUK|5|I am completely enthralled by this story!  Can't wait for the conclusion!  I am having a great time in the story!
0553381687|5|Fantasy is not typically a genre I enjoy reading but George RR Martin has done something special with this. The description of the people places is so vivid and I can picture the people and places as the book progresses. The history he provides for the families makes them seem so familiar and really causes you to feel for some and loathe the others. Awesome story - can't wait to keep reading the series!

0956010903|4|This kind of purchase, for me, was strictly for \\"collectable\\" reasons.  I am keeping this edition in the condition it came, plastic wrapper and all and purchasing the paperback to actually read.  This collectable edition is really quite exciting.  The book itself is small, about the size of a paperback book, it has faux purple jewels on the cover and is decorated with metal-like material in the middle and on the corners.  It comes in a beautiful velvet bag with a drawstring.  The book in the bag is then nestled in the larger hide-away book.  This hide-away book houses the collector's edition jeweled book and a folder which contains drawings by J.K. Rowling herself.  The prints are interesting.  Only one of the bunch is my taste to actually frame and hang.  I recommend this collectable edition as a \\"collectable\\".  The hide-away book is big.  The width and length are similar to a large laptop.  I am not dissapointed in what I received at my front door.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan and this collector's edition seemed to me to be a good investment.

B00M7UTFW0|1|The movie was bad
B001PE26QQ|4|The recent film \\"Fearless\\" (2006) starring Jet Li paved the way for this superior biopic about (Y)Ip Man, master of Wing Chun, who was the first to openly teach the art to the public.  He is also known to modern kung fu fans as the teacher of the one and only Bruce Lee.  The movie concentrates on the early adult life of Master Ip, when he lives in relative peace with his wife and young son in the city of Foshan.  This film has the benefits of an outstanding performance by Donnie Yen, the period detail and storytelling ability of director Wilson Yip, and the fantastic action choreography of Sammo Hung.  Hung here is exploring some old territory, as he previously directed, choreographed, and co-starred in two Wing Chun movies which documented the lineage that led to Yip Man:  \\"Warriors Two\\" (1978) and \\"The Prodigal Son\\" (1982).  Both have accurate and exciting depictions of the close-quarters fighting style, but \\"Ip Man\\" blazes new trails.<br /><br />Ip Man is a nice, respectful fellow, who occasionally spars in friendly, closed-door matches with the local masters (of which there are many) in Foshan.  Though often asked to take students, Master Ip politely declines.  The happy and content life in Foshan ends with World War II when the Japanese take over the town.  With all prosperity gone, Master Ip is forced to take a job (I feel your pain, bro.) digging coal.  Soon the Japanese come by looking for fighters to spar with their soldiers.  When a friend goes to fight and never comes back, Ip decides to find out what happened.  His superior fighting abilities are witnessed by a Japanese General (Shibuya Tenma) who wants Master Ip to train his troops.<br /><br />Donnie Yen is as quick and graceful as ever.  He and a few of his cohorts seem to be the only ones in Hong Kong interested in actually improving fight choreography in film.  \\"SPL\\" and \\"Flashpoint\\" (both directed by Yip) each broke new ground in screen fighting techniques.  Hell, I'll even admit that \\"Dragon Tiger Gate\\" (again, directed by Yip) is one of the better wire-fu flicks that I've ever sat through.  What puts this on the same level with those is that Wing Chun is not really the kind of martial art that looks good on film.  Not only do Yen and Sammo Hung pull it off, they also do so without sacrificing the integrity of the art.  It's not entirely flawless, with some wire use, bad slo-mo, and a little bit of goofy editing, but it's still fantastic.  Also worth mentioning is the performance of Fan Siu Wong (\\"Story of Ricky\\") as a Northern master who defeats all the major players in Foshan.  We need to see more of him too!<br /><br />Now on to the DVD:  Distributed by Sun Jian Media, it has no chapter selection (though there are chapters you can dig through sequentially), no special features, and no subtitles when paragraph after paragraph of Chinese newsprint tries to tell us what's going on.  If you know anything about history, it's not too hard to figure out, but how flippin' difficult is it to translate that stuff when you're already covering the dialogue?  And a biopic needs special features!  I can't stress that enough.  Also, the subtitles that are there disappear too quickly.  Subtitles are never a deterrent for me, but I'm not a speed-reader.  Minor complaint, I suppose.  When a better DVD comes along, I'll gladly buy it again, as this is a bona fide classic.  In widescreen with beautiful picture quality.  Mandarin  language with English subtitles.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  4.5 of 5<br /><br />2008. aka:  Yip Manrected by Yip) is one of the better wire-fu flicks that I've ever sat through.

B00004Z459|3|Who ever thought that when Linkin Park pounced onto the scene they would become the huge success they are today?  I surely never imagined they would become a household name.  I remember when I first heard of them.  A friend and I were at a local venue that housed small bands trying to make a name for themselves and Linkin Park just happened to be there.  I thought they were great. They had amazing energy on stage and their music was right up my ally.  A few months later I got my hands on a sampler CD sporting their first single `One Step Closer' as well as `With You'.  The studio was kind to them.  They sounded great cleaned up.  Then their debut album `Hybrid Theory' (which ironically was the original name of the band) dropped and suddenly the world belonged to Linkin Park.  Like Limp Bizkit before them, Linkin Park took the teen scene by storm and became the band everyone who was `cool' had to be listening to.  Unlike Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park's frontmen are not as insanely annoying as Fred Durst and thus their success has yet to fade.<br /><br />That said; this is the start of it all.  `Hybrid Theory' is the album that marked the beginning of something really big, and while it's not their finest album it serves as a great introduction to what these guys are capable of doing.<br /><br />`One Step Closer' was a great choice for a single.  The chords are simple yet exciting and the lyrics are angry and aggressive.  Chester and Mike feed off one another very well, but what you'd never guess from this single is the fact that Mike Shinoda is actually an extremely good lyricist.  Just listen to the opening track `Papercut'.  Shinoda spits fire over a hip-hop influenced rock beat while Chester bellows out the chorus lines.  Another great example of this duo working well together is `A Place for My Head', which is quite possibly the best song this band has ever done.  The beat is sic and the song just feels complete.  The `reanimated' version is even better.  Their most famous single is probably `In the End', a subdued rap track where Mike lets his rhymes slowly drip from his lips over pounding bass line.  `With You', `By Myself' and `Forgotten' follow more of a rock structure musically but continue to feature Mike's rapping as the dominating vocals.  They don't work as well as the others and somewhat seem to mesh together.<br /><br />Then Linkin Park decides to let Chester have some spotlight recognition.  Like on `One Step Closer', Chester takes the reigns on songs like `Points of Authority' and `Runaway'.  `Points of Authority' was never a real standout for me.  Chester sounds great, but the song as a whole is not that impressive.  The `reanimated' version is far superior.  `Runaway' is a decent track, nothing phenomenal, but well constructed.  Then we have `Crawling', one of the tracks that made Linkin Park as widely acclaimed as they've become.  The song is utter perfection.  It's delicate in parts, distressed in others, yet it all comes together beautifully.  The last track on the album, `Pushing Me Away', also serves as a highlight of the album for me.  It's the softest track here but it works extremely well for the band.<br /><br />Then you have `Cure for the Itch', which serves as a decent yet unimpressive intermission.<br /><br />The album is far from brilliant, but it is entertaining and it marks the start of a band that continues to grow.  I don't know what possessed them to release the mess that was `Minutes to Midnight' but I have faith that they will redeem themselves.  `Reanimation' and `Meteora' are both fantastic albums that show the growth this band has undergone since releasing this debut album.  `Minutes to Midnight' is truly a bump in the road for them, but hopefully their next studio album will bring forth redemption.robably `In the End', a subdued rap track where Mike lets his rhymes slowly drip from his lips over pounding bass line.  `With You', `By Myself' and `Forgotten' follow more of a rock structure musically but continue to feature Mike's rapping as the dominating vocals.

B008JFUS0U|4|The film opens with the defeat of Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with darkness called &#34;the ether&#34; apparently a hater of the cinema. He is defeated and the ether is hidden somewhere deep where it can't be found. Then the movie title hits the screen: &#34;Thor: The Dark World.&#34; Not too hard to figure this one out and since Natalie Portman doesn't work for bus fare, you can bet she will be prominent in the film.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth provides us with some early beefcake moments for what is a borderline chick flick. I found Darcy (Kat Dennings) to be the most entertaining character in the film, too bad she was underutilized. The film excelled in special effects, but had a plot we could figure out before the title flashed on the screen, minus some details. Thor was played rather stiffly and made Loki (Tom Hiddleston) likeable. The writers need to lighten him up.<br /><br />Worth a view on the big screen. We will all add this to our growing Avengers' collection, although I might wait for a price drop on this one.

0061002747|5|I will not discuss the book which is, in my opinion, one of Agatha's best. I would like to mention a clue that seems to be overlooked by Poirot. This message does not reveal who the murderer is, but you should not read it unless you already read Orient Express, because it might spoil you the fun.<br />The clue is about compartments in the railroad car. As you know, the murderer(s) wanted to book up all the compartments in the Istanbul - Calais car, but the compartment number 1 has been booked months before, by the company's director, Mr. Buck (Poirot ended in that compartment later). Now that implicates that the compartments were allocated sequentially. Mr. Rechet got the compartment number 2, his valet Mr. Masterman got the bed number 4 (the first available bed in the second class) while his secretary Mr. McQueen got the bed number 6 in the next second class compartment. All that implicates some kind of the plot, since the car was obviously empty (except for Mr. Buck) before Rechet and his escort booked their tickets, and then all the sudden the whole bunch came. <br />Let us proceed. In his statement Mr. McQueen states that the valet always traveled second class, but he (McQueen) usually traveled first class, so that his employer, Mr. Rechet could use McQueen's compartment to store his own luggage. But on this occasion all the first class compartments were booked, so McQueen had to travel second class. Now that is a highly suspicious statement - Rechet got number 2, and McQueen and Masterman got the first two class 2 compartments. It seems like first class compartments 3 (etc.) and the complete second class was empty when Mr. Rechet's ticket was bought and that McQueen did not want to be in the compartment number 3, next to Rechet's, for some reasons of his own. He also did not want to share the compartment with Masterman, since they could probably have booked beds number 4 and 5. All that strongly points to some kind of the conspiracy engineered by McQueen who, as a secretary, was in charge of booking tickets.
B000NA28I4|2|There's two ways to look at a movie based on a book. One is to hope it really does justice to the fine writing in the book, and brings that vision to life. The other is to completely ignore the book and hope that the movie simply is a great movie, loosely based on a book text.<br /><br />To review Eragon fairly, my boyfriend and I took two different points of view. I read the book first, so I would judge the movie against the book. He did NOT read the book first, so he could watch the movie without any bias.<br /><br />We both thought the movie did a VERY poor job.<br /><br />Let's look at why. Interestingly, the things he laughed at, I laughed at as well. Probably the most key issue was the development of Saphira, the dragon. In the book, Ergaon builds a meaningful relationship with her over time. He learns about her, she learns about him, they grow to care for each other. There are subtle interplays with Saphira's jealousy and love for him. Out of all of the book's substance, this is probably the best done, and the key for the story.<br /><br />To me, the \\"five second explosion\\" where Saphira morphs from a gremlin-like baby dragon into a full grown dragon was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. It killed much of the meaning of the story. Interestingly, Bob (my boyfriend) found this morph equally ridiculous. Even without having read the book, he could clearly see that this was wrong.<br /><br />So many of the movie's scenes and dialogue are stolen from other movies that it was hard to count them all. The one in particular that had us both rolling on the ground with laughter was when Luke Skywalker (oh sorry, I mean Eragon) was wistfully looking off into the sunset as the music swelled. We kept looking for that second sun of Tattoine. Could you have been more obvious there?<br /><br />There were sections of dialogue where I literally could recite the words along with the characters, even though they weren't in the book. The things they said were THAT predictable.<br /><br />With really well written books, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the set designers would keep copies of the book on set, referring to them page by page to ensure they had the details exactly right. JK Rowlings was called in frequently when the first Harry Potter book was made into a movie, to ensure that the costumes and environments were perfect.<br /><br />In comparison, you have to wonder if the movie makers here even read the book. The things they \\"got wrong\\" are staggering. Yes, you could say that the book was very flawed to begin with and that they were trying to \\"fix\\" it. But if that were the case, they would have improved on the book. Instead, even the important parts of the book are lost completely - and the thievery involved in the movie is almost even more blatant than what the book held.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the book was without flaws. For example, one serious issue for me was that the only real female character - the elf, Arya - was comatose for 99% of the book. In the movie, Arya is much more talkative. You could say they \\"changed the book here\\" - but to me it was like enhancing Arwen and Eowyn's part in the Lord of the Rings movies. The book had a flaw, and they fixed it. To me that's a healthy change. Of course, they somehow turned Arya from an elf into a human, but that was minor compared to other issues.<br /><br />In general, the damage the movie plot wrought was far more severe. They destroyed Eragon's relationship with Saphira. They destroyed much of the meaning of Brom's mentorship, and of Murtagh's friendship. The variety of villager issues between Eragon and various people was simplified to \\"everyone is scared of the Evil Empire\\".<br /><br />In the end, my boyfriend, who watched the movie \\"without prejudice\\" (i.e. no book knowledge) felt VERY disappointed by what it offered as a story. I, who HAD read the book first, felt equally disappointed with how it interpreted the book. Most movies at least either please the book readers orplease movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.please movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.
B0001ENY6M|5|Anyone who's a true Christian and has seen the movie NEEDS to get this. My favorite time to listen to it is when I spend time with the Lord in private, every bit of the epic score is captured on the disc. You can almost see the scenes from the film pass through your mind as you listen. Five stars without any doubt!
B00003CXSP|3|First off, I absolutely hate Ridley Scott.  His fetish for the acid trip-like dream sequences is annoying and usually they don't fit into the rest of his cinematography.  That wasn't what really ruined this film.  What did it in was the fact that it followed the novel beautifully until the last 3 or so chapters, when someone had the horrible idea of changing the ending!  In the novel, Hannibal and Clarice just happen to run off together.  She never tries to escape, he never cuts off his hand.  It's supposed to end as if there will not be another sequal.  But no, someone, be it Scott or whoever did the screenplay, didn't have the sack to use that ending.  It would be too offensive for the public to handle, so it was changed so Hannibal still looks evil and Clarice still looks like the good \\"guy\\".  In Hollywood, good and evil can not merge, it's just against all rules of filmmaking, right?  Someone shouldn't have been as concerned with their paycheck, and more concerned with making a true adaptation of a novel.

Paul does an amazing job in producing this record, and the guitars are loud and proud! Each time I listen to the array of songs, it just keeps on getting better and better! The song writing is classic kiss with catchy hooks and melodic solos....proving that they are just as good as they ever were in the 70's, 80's, 90's and so on.

I bought the book for my kids, who I am very sure will be moved for the strong desire of the boy to study, his enormous curiosity for science, and the terrible economic and political situation of Malawi. This is not fiction. This is a story of real life, of a hard, of the tragic conditions in Africa when you are poor but you have a vision. It should be mandatory to read in high schools.

B009NQKPUW|4|I have not seen the director's cut yet. It feels like the theatrical release may have left some of the plot on the cutting room floor. Perhaps I was expecting too much of a film that is primarily action and effects, but I thought it was marketed as more of a science fiction piece.  The effects did not get in the way of the story, but the story could have used some help, if felt a bit too minimalistic for my tastes.

Not her best friend who thinks she could do way better than a rock wanna be. But those things don't matter to Lola. No one is going to stand in between her and her guy.  That is until Cricket Bell shows up next door. Cricket Bell the same boy who, two years earlier, made her heart flutter and break in one short summer. The boy she swore would never mean anything to her again.  But something's changed. Cricket isn't only taller, he's startlingly better looking, and seemingly interested in her. With mixed up feelings, and new emotions bubbling up inside her Lola's definitely in love - but with who?  Lola and the Boy Next Door written by author Stephanie Perkins is a straight up romance novel full of whimsical fun, laughs, and of course love. Far from fluffy, Perkins second novel conquers facing the ups and downs of first love.  Perkins writing is flawless. Full of the wit and humor, her words not only make for a memorable story, but breathes life into her characters. Lola, especially, is unforgettable. From her many over the top wigs to funky I don't give a damn style, Lola is the kind of person every girl wants to be friends with, and every guy wants to date.  Lola and the Boy Next Door is a read for everyone, from fashionista to punk rock princesses. And best of all (at least to me) is that it features Marie Antoinette, or at least a Marie Antoinette costume!

Unlike many stories involving the science fiction of time travel, in this one the traveler has no control: a journey through the back of Al's Diner always ends at the same point:  September 9, 1958.  Templeton reasons that there is a short list of events that have had major impact on world history - the Kennedy assassination one of them.  So investing the five plus years in the past between 1958 to that fateful day in Dallas in 1963 to determine if Oswald really was working alone, and if so, to stop him, would be well worth the sacrifice.  But Templeton finds that the past is obdurate - it resists being changed.  So before completing his quest, he is stricken with terminal cancer, and it becomes very clear to him that Al will die before being able to complete the mission of his accidental journey.  Enter Jake Epping, English teacher at the local high school and casual friend of Al's.  Armed with Al's crazy story and his detailed notes, he steps - literally - through the pantry and back into 1958, just as Al described, and assumes the role of history-changer.  What follows is a rich and unexpected mix of nostalgia, history, love, and mystery, all wrapped in King's unparalleled knack for detail, subtle foreshadow, and suspense.  The imagery is superb: \\"Cocked on the back of his head was a filthy fedora that looked straight out of a 1950's film noir, the kind where all the women have big bazonkas and all the men talk fast around the cigarettes stuck in the corners of their mouths.\\" And as in much of King's work, inanimate objects take on sinister qualities: in this case, it is the past which proves to be a worthy, daunting, and malevolent adversary.<br /><br />I've observed that readers of fiction fall into two general categories - those who love Stephen King and those who can't tolerate him.  As I see it, \\"11/22/63\\" bridges these two groups; a fascinating blend of rich history and clever fiction that, while lacking the horror and terror expected from King, provides twists and turns and enough mystique to make this unmistakably Stephen King.  And strangely, this is also a love story; a tale complicated by the paradox of time; a sensitive treatment that avoids being maudlin while delivering a knockout blow as powerful and poignant as you'll ever read from accomplished authors known more for romance than terror.<br /><br />In short, \\"11/22/63\\" may be Stephen King's most important work; the culmination of over four decades of writing - an ambitious but superbly executed epic that dares to cross genres and succeeds on all fronts.  Whether you are a fan of historical fiction, science fiction, drama, suspense - or Stephen King - this is simply a novel you can't afford to miss.stuck in the corners of their mouths.\\" And as in much of King's work, inanimate objects take on sinister qualities: in this case, it is the past which proves to be a worthy, daunting, and malevolent adversary.<br /><br />I've observed that readers of fiction fall into two general categories - those who love Stephen King and those who can't tolerate him.

B004FGMDOQ|3|Not what I expected but an interesting coming of age and time traveling story.  The photographs woven into the story was enchanting and,I think a brilliant vehicle to spin a yarn.
B00005RIXP|4|With the possible exception of the Carvaradossi, this is an exceptional cast and an exceptional Tosca overall.  John Shaw's Scarpia is lasciviously rich-voiced, his mobile expressive face tiptoe-ing near campy at times but staying on the right side of the line.  Terrific.  Ms. Marton uses her splendid emotion-telegraphing vocal resources to wonderful effect.  Mario (Lamberto Furlan) is vocally not in these leagues with a smallish voice, sometimes sharpish edge and effortful singing, but he does not spoil the proceedings.  The production is a good standard Tosca, no surprises, but who needs them for this masterpiece?<br /><br />Lots of fun here (I say fun, because this melodrama is so juicy and done with such Puccinian genius it makes me smile continuously when it is done well as this is.)<br /><br />I bought this for Eva Marton, but happily there is much much more here that is memorable.  My all-time favorite Scarpia is Ruggerio Raimondi in the \\"live\\" Tosca with Domingo and Malfitano, but John Shaw made me watch his Scarpia with equal enjoyment.  Different, less deeply oily and satanic, but terrific.

0679452729|5|Ken Follett wrote this book in Robin Cook style and did a good job of it. It's a well written book with a not entirely unbelievable plot.
B009CRNM7K|1|My issue with this book, and the phenomenon it has created, is---the authors are not psychologists, researchers, or doctors. They are not family therapists, or relationship experts. These authors are script writers.<br />Quite literally a comedian and a script writer.<br /><br />Taking relationship and human interaction advice from these folks is like, getting a cancer assessment from your landscaper. Why are you all listening to this drivel?<br /><br />The premise for these books are based off a \\"Sex and the City\\" episode, and from that script a relationship philosophy was spawned that was meant to shame people into believing they are being consistently used and manipulated for the temporary amusement of someone else.<br /><br />Folks--people just aren't that exploitive of others. And if someone IS that exploitive---then you are dealing with an abnormal pathology. Because the authors actually lack insight and education into human psychology and behavior they discount attachment styles, personality disorders, trauma, human behavior, and human development---all of which weave together to create the personality of a human being and results in how that individual is capable of interacting with others.<br /><br />There are millions of normal people, who are kind and want very badly to love others, but are hindered in that behavior by other factors. Which doesn't mean, at all, that your significant other is not \\"Into You.\\" They are usually just doing the very best they are capable. But that viewpoint isn't quite as much of a \\"put down\\" and there for, not as sensational.<br /><br />Also Greg asserts that men who are really in love will do ANYTHING to get the woman they want, and provides examples (his own relationship being one) as solid proof. Unfortunately men who actually do behave that intensely are people without appropriate boundaries, self-restraint, or emotional control---and are frequently so horribly insecure they are chasing you with that level of intensity because they want to seal the deal before you have the chance to catch on to who they really are.<br /><br />These books are not insightful--it's written from an emotionally stunted point of view by people who don't have the credentials to be making these kinds of broad assessments.<br /><br />If you would like to actually understand relationships better I would recommend this book: Attached, the Science of Adult Attachment.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369004071&sr=8-1&keywords=attached+the+new+science+of+adult+attachment
B008QE9VJI|1|It's kind of become a joke when Tim Burton puts out a movie.  You can predict the actors without blinking.  He needs to diversify!  As a fan of the classic series and all it's campy, over-dramatic, long drawn-out plot lines, this was the poorest excuse for a tribute!!!  I grew up watching this on reruns in the late 80's.  I now own the entire original series.  I almost walked out in the first ten minutes.  My spouse said I had this look of pure disgust through-out the whole thing... except when I managed a giggle at Alice Coopers expense.  The fact that all Tim Burton did for the original cast was to give them a walk-on, was so disrespectful and half-assed!  I often wonder if the screening of this film killed the good and great Jonathan Frid!?  It was an insult!!!  The only thing that Burton got right was hiring Danny.  Danny Elfman is the only person that managed to capture the essence of the original!  Avoid this train-wreck and give the original series your money and time!

006202406X|2|I think Veronica Roth either didn't like being a popular author or was trying to shock the heck out of readers so her version of a dystopian future would be remembered. Unfortunately, if the latter is the case, I think she just ended her YA writing career--and a movie franchise with it. How did her editor and publisher allow this?<br /><br />I just met Roth at a signing and told her how upset I was with this book. Her flippant reply?  &#34;Maybe you should go get some ice cream or something so you can feel better.&#34;  I completely agree that these are her characters to do with as she wishes, but as a school librarian, I won't be recommending this series to my students any longer. The thing about YA dystopian fiction is that it always leaves the readers with a sense of hope. I didn't get that here at all. Even a complete memory wipe for Tris and Tobias would have been preferable to this.<br /><br />And I haven't even touched on the humongous holes this story has, which were very ably pointed out in many other reviews here.<br /><br />All in all, I'm devastated and very, very baffled by Roth's choices. Was having Tris as a Christ figure more important than telling a good, satisfying story?
B0007PLLQ0|1|The main reason I bought the movie was because of the original music that was in it. They have re-edited the whole movie with another soundtrack making it a totally different movie. It is just not as good a movie as my VHS tape of the original theatrical release. What happened to it?

B000001FS6|4|U2's 1988 release \\"Rattle and Hum\\" captures the music from the film of the same name. If \\"Joshua Tree\\" was their \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" then \\"Rattle and Hum\\" is their White Album. It's ambitious and features some great performances, but is also self-indulgent and bombastic.<br /><br />It's not really a \\"live\\" release in the traditional sense of gathered concert material, or in most cases, concert versions of the hits. This is a hodge-podge of songs. There are live covers, such as \\"Helter Skelter\\" (\\"this is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles...we're stealing it back\\") and Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\" There are live versions of hits like the excellent \\"Pride\\" and the gospel choir \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\\" Bono hits his most strident preachiness on \\"Silver and Gold\\" with the South Africa diatribe and the response to the audience indifferent with \\"Am I buggin' you?<br /><br />Don't mean to bug ya.\\" and his dead-on portrayal of America in \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" with the \\"ABC News, Hill Street Blues and preacher from the old time gospel hour\\" and the best line ever of \\"well the God I believe in isn't short of cash, mister!\\"<br /><br />The biggest hit from the disk is \\"Desire\\" with it's edgy three-chord groove and powerful beat. I also enjoy the R&B-style tribute to Billie Holiday \\"Angel of Harlem.\\" There's a guest appearance by B.B. King on \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" and a number of non-live tracks recorded on the road or in sound checks like \\"Van Dieman's Land\\" with vocals by The Edge and \\"Hawkmoon 269.\\"<br /><br />The theme that unites this song cycle is U2 exploring American roots music during their Joshua Tree tour, and exposing both the light and shadows of things they discovered on their journey.

B00KTDD69A|2|If you are foolish enough to pay $4.99 to unlock the full game, as I did, you will be disappointed. Biggest flaw is that it doesn't save scores consistently so that you  can't revisit where you left off. Also, much too much advertising -- shouldn't be there at all when you pay this much.

B00000ING2|4|Ok, ok, the title of the movie stinks and probably contributed to the movie hitting the basement, as soon as it was released. Still, it is a pretty clever and unusual movie. The premise is simple. The CEO and founder of a very successful, major corporation commits suicide. Consequently, his shares of the corporation must be sold publicly. To the dismay of the board of directors, this means that more than half the company will be owned by outsiders.<br /> Corporate executive, Sidney Mussberger, wonderfully played by the ever handsome Paul Newman, devises a fiendish scheme to devalue the shares of the corporation. He will simply hire a numbskull and esconce him as the new CEO in order to drive the company temporarily into the ground, causing the value of the shares to plummet. The board of directors can then afford to buy the outstanding shares floating out there at rock bottom prices, retaining control of the corporation.<br /> Sidney subsequently selects Norville Barnes, a dopey, but nice guy, played with cow eyed innocence by Tim Robbins, who works in the company mailroom, a place reminiscent of the movie Metropolis. Barnes happens to have an idea that he has been working on for years. When he shows a picture of a circle as representative of his idea, the viewer wonders just what the heck is so special about it.  So does Sidney, who allows Barnes to execute his idea, believing him to be a total moron whose idea is just the thing to make the companies stock tank.  This is where the Coen Brother's cleverness begins to kick in. When the viewer realizes what that circle actually is, the movie will be kicking into full gear. It is, at times, hilarious. See the film to find out just what Barnes has been working on for years. Sidney learns that the best laid plans often go awry.<br /> Barnes becomes enamored of Amy Archer, a female reporter, who smells that something is not quite right at corporate headquarters. The role is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh in an over the top, highly stylized, uneven parody of Katherine Hepburn. Still, she makes this affectation work in the context of this film. In fact, the rat-a-tat-tat tempo of her delivery contributes to giving the film its feel of a bygone time. The action in the film purportedly takes place in the nineteen fifties, but the sets are nineteen thirties art nouveau in feel and style, as is the rapid fire delivery of some of the dialogue. This creates an odd, somewhat disconcerting, dissonanace, contributing to the film's overall quirkiness.<br /> This is an underrated film that deserves a look by movie lovers everywhere. It has the makings of a cult classic.p, highly stylized, uneven parody of Katherine Hepburn. Still, she makes this affectation work in the context of this film.

0684847817|4|The first thing that strikes you about this book is the pure beauty!  The unique cover and way the book is bound, The Good Faeries is on one side, turn it over and The Bad Faries are there.  Reading the book from just one cover, you'll have to turn it upside down when you reach the other section. This book is, from start to finish seemingly written, designed, and imagined by the fae themselves. Brian Froud is definitely communicating with these magical beings.  The names and art work bring their personalities to life so vividly.  You'll find there is a fairy who causes any sort of mischief from that one sock that always disappears from the dryer, to your toast hitting the floor butter side up.  Touching, lovely, hilarious, and at times a little scary, this is one of the best books I have ever seen on the fae.  Brian Froud is truly gifted not only with artistic genius, but with the ability to see beyond our world and take us there with him.
055380684X|3|This book is okay. It is not very well written and its explanation of the &#34;Talent Cose&#34; is a bit elemental. Wouldn't recommend buying it.

B00005JKG9|4|The other day I was discussing salespeople with a friend and we determined that nobody likes being sold anything. Coincidental, then, that I saw Glengarry Glen Ross that night, as the film seems to support our hypothesis, but it adds another dimension to it: the salespeople themselves may not necessarily even like selling anything. In fact, the men in this movie are selling for survival; if they don't sell, they don't eat. <br /> <br />Near the beginning of the film, a man from the downtown office (Alec Baldwin) offers encouragement to three salesmen who aren't meeting their quotas by way of verbal abuse. First prize is a brand new Cadillac, second prize is a set of steak knives, and third prize is the door: you're fired. The men are selling real estate, using the weak leads handed down to them from above. There is Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), nicknamed The Machine for his past sales record, who has hit a wall in his career and can't seem to close any more sales. He desperately needs to keep his job to pay medical bills for his wife. Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is fed up with all of the bureaucracy, and doesn't feel people should be treated this way--and they shouldn't. George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) isn't the sharpest tool in the drawer, and tends to be swayed by his colleagues. <br /> <br />All three of these men are jealous of the only guy making any sales lately, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino). Dave is convinced that the rest of them would be doing just as well if they were getting the good leads that he is, but according to their by-the-book company-pleasing manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), only closers are worthy of the good leads--the Glengarry leads. Dave comes up with a plan to break into the office, steal the leads, and sell them to the competitor across the street, and tries to convince George to do the dirty work, and as a reward, he can take a cut of the pay and have a job with the competitor. We don't see the actual robbery, though--only the aftermath--and it'snot clear who exactly did what. Everyone's got their motives, but who had the guts to do it? <br /> <br />Glengarry Glen Ross was written by David Mamet based on his stage play of the same name, and it must have been an actor's paradise. There are no special effects, hardly any sets at all, and some fantastic dialogue, which flows with the cadence that only Mamet can produce. Nobody else can write profanity with such poetry. Director James Foley doesn't intrude on his actors, which is the perfect way to deal with this talk-heavy picture. The acting is excellent all around, especially by screen legend Jack Lemmon, though nobody is overshadowed by anybody else. <br /> <br />The only fault I found with the film was the abrupt ending, but to go into any more detail would be a crime against anybody who hasn't seen the film. The subject matter is fascinating, as most of us have only seen salesmen when they're being phonies. Here they are given personalities, and are struggling with not only their jobs, but with their lives, and they live in such a sheltered world that they can't even see the opportunities that might be available outside of this bubble. It's a really foolish idea to steal from the place you have to go to every day, but if you don't know any better, it makes perfect sense.
B00BAXFECK|2|I kept waiting for a climax but never got one.  Depressing without drama.  Well written but boring.  No characters to sympathize with.

B0000DD7LB|4|I'll admit, I am a hardcore Britney fan. But when she decided to take her hiatus, which really for her, wasn't a break... I was kind of skeptical on how she might be able to return back into the music scene. Sure, Britney gets a lot of publicity - but not for her music. Even though I own all her previous albums, I think they're not really that good. 'Britney' was the best, and that's not saying much. So literally, I counted down the days until 'In The Zone' came out, and I got it the day after. I was totally blown away by this more mature Britney! Her lyrics are better, the music is better, and even though her vocals are computerized on most of the songs, they're not as computerized as much as you think. 'In The Zone' exceeded my expectations, and for the first time in a long time, I am not ashamed to say I'm a hardcore Britney fan!<br />1.Me Against the Music - if you judged how you thought Brit's album would sound by this song as the first single, you really should take more time to hear her album. The other songs are way better than this. Good effort from Brit and Madge tho.<BR>2.(I Got That) Boom Boom - Great song, definitely catchy. It's great that Britney worked with the Ying Yang Twins. Cool 'crunk' (southern-hip-hop) beat!<BR>3.Showdown - I'm still debating on whether I really really like the song, or if it's just ok. The lyrics are really cool though.<BR>4.Breathe On Me - GREAT song. Very sensual. Britney pulls it off well.<BR>5.Early Mornin' - Britney's track with Moby. The song's cool, and Britney convinces you that she's had bad experiences with hangovers, lol.<BR>6.Toxic - I LOVE this song! It's 'intoxicating'. lol. Definitely a good track.<BR>7.Outrageous - Ah, here's the song R. Kelly wrote. Got kind of an Arabic sound/feel to it. The lyrics are a little repetitive, but other than that, it's cool.<BR>8.Touch Of My Hand - This is definitely Britney's most mature track on the album. She talks about 'indulging in herself', and the music just sets everything right. GREAT GREAT song.<BR>9.The Hook Up - I don't really like this song. I tolerate it, and I'll listen to it, but you know. The lyrics aren't that great either. Britney can do way better, and her songwriting on other tracks prove that.<BR>10.Shadow - I didn't like this song at first... I love it now. Britney's lyrical talent really shines on this track.<BR>11.Brave New Girl - Bits and pieces of this song remind me of Madonna's 'Ray Of Light'. I like this song, it's a feel good and fun song.<BR>12.Everytime - One word: Haunting. This is definitely one of the best tracks Britney has ever written, ever sung, and one of the the best slow songs she's ever had on an album. Everyone says it's a response to Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me a River', but I have JT's album, and on his track, 'Never Again', he says &quot;and all you had to do was apologize...&quot; On Britney's track, it says, &quot;and this song is my sorry...&quot; So read into however you like. I love this song.<BR>13.Me Against the Music (Remix) - I like this better than the original 'Me Against the Music.' Not much is different except the music, but I like it!<br />'In The Zone' is Britney's best album yet. She shines on this album, and is more mature and in control of her musical direction than ever. I think she could pick up a new wave of fans, older fans, if they'd just take the time out to listen to her music and what she has to say. As for me, I'm gonna be with her until the end. And with this album, Britney proves that she's not going anywhere anytime soon.<BR> Go out and buy 'In The Zone.' It'll definitely be worth it!

B000002IJO|4|Basically Ratt have a downward trajectory that's almost a straight line.  Their first album \\"Out of the Cellar\\" was their hands-down best - and their later records just get progressively a little worse over time.  This record was made when Ratt was still on the favorable end of that curve.    If you like \\"Out of the Cellar\\" and \\"Invasion of your Privacy\\", this record has the same sound, Beau Hill production, and hedonistic anthemic feel that made Ratt such a great band in the 80's.  So if you know that sound, and you like it, you will enjoy this record.  If you're new to Ratt,  I would recommend picking up their self-titled debut before this one.  Avoid their later output, because most anything they've done without Beau Hill is mediocre at best.  In fact, Ratt in my book basically has 4 albums worth owning: \\"Out of the Cellar\\", \\"Invasion of your Privacy\\", \\"Dancing Undercover\\", and \\"Reach for the Sky\\" - but I digress.    Truthfully,  this album gets an unfair amount of criticism, as there's a lot to like here.  For one thing, the album plays better than any other Ratt record from beginning to end.  Individually, the songs themselves, with a couple exceptions, are just ok, but the songs are sequenced in the first half in a way that draws you in from the anthemic but sort of forgettable \\"Dance\\" - which immediately seques into \\"One Good Lover\\" - the best song on the record in my opinion, and good enough to buy the album for, to the energetic \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" which showcases the rhythm section a little bit.  Although the guitars and Pearcy's voice really define the sound of the group, these guys are all capable musicians in the studio - at least they were when this was made before drugs and sex addictions started to rip them apart.    We slip back into average with the mid-tempo \\"Slip of the Lip\\" and pick up again for \\"Body Talk\\", which leads into \\"Looking for Love\\", which is another good 150 BPM metal anthem.    Unfortunately, this is where things drop off.  The album continues on with respectable Ratt anthems that stand well together but not as well on their own.  \\"Enough is Enough\\" is the only minor standout, which of course, they put at the very end of the record.    Overall, I've got an admitted soft spot for this group and continue to hope that they'll put something out today that would even approach this record or any of their earlier output in terms of quality (rumor has it that there is, in fact, a new album in the works for 2009) - for change has not been good to them.

141694737X|3|Granted our 10 month old likes this book but we were a little disappointed when it arrived and the exploring flaps are just paper, not a sturdier cardboard.  Also the flaps are hard for her to open on her own so we have to start the flap and she then opens it the rest of the way.  She can get a bit rough with the flaps and we have to be on guard so they don't rip.  So far so good.

0393317552|5|This book is well worth reading. Its author, Jared Diamond, is what in my day was called a `cultural geographer', that is he is student of how the geo-physical environment effects the development of human society and its culture. In this book he attempts the heroic task of explaining the phenomenon of European world dominance from the 16th Century through most of the 20th Century in terms of geography and climate.<br /><br />Does he succeed? Well yes and no. In point of fact, as he himself admits, the geo-physical environment cannot completely explain the evolution of human societies which is much too complex to be explained so simply. What Diamond does do very well is explain the effect of geography and climate on food production, animal husbandry and cultural diffusion (i.e. the spread of agricultural techniques and technology in general). In the course of doing so he discusses such interesting phenomena as the role of population densities on technical development and disease resistance. His basic thesis is that Europe (and by extension North America, Australia and New Zealand) became dominant because of a geo-physical environment highly suitable to food production and that Europe's population density and cultural diversity created a breeding ground for both diseases (and disease resistance) and technological innovation. More controversially, he maintains that China's backwardness until the late 20th Century is entirely attributable to its monolithic culture and, expect for short intervals, its unified political system.<br /><br />I have one caveat for readers of this book. It does not provide a fact filled, irrefutable proof that human history can be explained entirely in terms of geography and climate. Diamond, I am certain, would be dismayed if anyone thought so. It does provide the engaged reader with a fascinating and plausible theory of how geography played one of the key roles in the evolution of human society
B000LPQ6DE|3|This version was rather good, but if you wish to get an actual feel for the original novel--You're completely out of luck. Both Jane and Mr.Rochester's parts were acted well, and the chemistry between the two actors really made the movie, but it just wasn't the real Jane Eyre. This version diverged from the book on almost every point, even the simplest of details was reworked and rewritten. They more or less modernized it...just without changing the time period. Language was simplified (a heinous crime in my estimation for Charlotte Bronte's ease and fluidity of writing is of the utmost importance in the original--her writing was what really made the story spectacular as well as timeless), and both Jane and Mr.Rochester acted a bit more free-spirited...but in a way that just didn't suit their original characters. So all in all, great movie if you've read the book, but not to be taken as a direct interpretation.
