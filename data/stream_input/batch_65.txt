B005WTPDOM|5|LIVE IN THE NORTH WEST AND LOTS OF RAIN.ONLY WIPER I WILL EVER USE..AWESOME SERVICE.
B00029WVIS|5|Good quality mirror compared to other types i bought recently, I used old suction cup mobile holder to hold this mirror and I put the mobile holder on right side small window just after the front door(don't know what you call it). And its giving a good view which I can adjust as desired its covering the full 90 degrees of right side view which also includes the blind spot area.
B0059KHB6C|5|Perfect fit and function
B000F0X566|5|Fit my car perfectly
B00CB0461Q|5|Excellent high quality downpipes! Awesome thing about these is they are not much louder than the factory cats. I'm totally impressed and happy with the solo downpipe. Install took about 2-3 hours. Fast shipping and they included a t shirt, key chain and a few other nice items.
B001JT98S6|5|Very heavy duty, High quality. Would buy again.
B00LNIPBH0|4|Nice products, great seller but I didn't like the color.
B00EVY2SKG|5|Nice clothes, does very well
B00EAOIHR0|3|I bought this because it contained charcoal. I thought this would help with local farm smells. I noticed no difference from the stock Ford filter with  no charcoal.
B00GHT7ZYM|5|I work at a dealership And this part was half the price of the dealer part even at my cost. Looks identical to what I took off and functions perfectly. Ford  probably buys this part from Dorman and resells under their name for twice the price
B00YI5W3NU|5|Go on very easy and no one can tell that they are an aftermarket ABS add on. Make sure you use the adhesive primer before attaching. Very pleased with the quality and color match is almost spot on. Looks good with the black grille I installed, was not a fan of the all chrome grille.
B00L84944K|5|Superb!!! Excellent fit!! Great nee look to the front of my 09 GMC SIERRA
B00GHS6VMA|4|good to 80%; accessories given along did not fit perfectly; the DIY manual served its purpose;
B00TD31R4S|5|Awesome! Save $200 and buy this instead of from Jeep! I installed it in 15 minutes on my wife's 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk. It looks exactly like the stock vinyl, but $200 less!
B00UHD4HJA|3|Many of the stickers I received were just ehh. I was overall disappointed.
B00KGPY4CE|5|This item fit the door for the 2010 Sonata and was very easy to install. Shipping was late,but it is coming from overseas so I sort of expected that.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Have a triple black Mustang GT: black exterior, black interior, black leather seats and this microfiber duster keeps it all clean! When it arrived it was actually bigger than I expected which is great because it covers more surface area at once. The microfiber does not scratch; I know that is always a concern with black vehicles. The handle is super sturdy; this is not a flimsy product and I know it will last me many many years.
B004BYX8W8|5|Worked great!  Shipped fast!
B00HX0AY9M|5|Good stuff
B0075KXOF6|5|Love this cover, very clean looking and easy to use. Let's me use the entire bed to haul stuff when I need to.
B000C7ZA5G|5|I used this to replace a Motorcraft CX741 and it fit perfectly in my 1990 Ford Bronco 2.<br /><br />My only negative would be that it did not include the plastic caps on the top, but neither did the Motorcraft part. Fortunately, I was able to salvage the caps from the old canister.
B00I5WXAS4|5|Good product for a money. After installation alignment checked good. In some cases may need caster or camber ajusting  bolts if you want  alignment to be perfect. One thing I don't know how long this parts will last driving on city roads.
B0002NILQ0|5|Love it...
B009RETI58|5|This cute little key chain is holding up very well...I love it!
B00OWS4IQI|4|A very nice item made even better with a $50 rebate.  Very easy to install and the materials appear to be well made and hopefully will be durable.  The price is attractive and I see this as an entry level item that should do the job well.  Unfortunately, the tonneau cover could not be stretched enough to fit into the rear rail and after contacting Bestop and Amazon, I realized it was going to be easier to shorten the side rails 3/4&#34; vs. going through a Return Process with no guarantee that the replacement would be any better.  Ten minutes of trimming and adjusting the rails resulted in a perfectly fitting cover.  Shortening the side rails did not adversely affect the fit on the bed or tailgate and I actually think the tailgate closes more easily now.  The problem has been reported to Bestop and hopefully, the next Colorado owner who buys this cover will have better luck!
B007NZWZ1C|5|Fit perfect
B00D8FR34K|5|Quality lights at a low price.I am putting them on my boat tailor. They work great and are bright. Even during the day time.
B001SG7U2G|5|Actually got a 4 pack. 2 that fit and 2 of another style but the ones that were for my 98 s10 fit perfect.
B003750D7U|1|Didn't use it for alignment because it suggests an adapter piece is needed which I didn't find when I searched amazon as related item or even google or the manufactures website. The adapter piece was not noted that its needed before I bought it. I aligned my wheels as best I could with the string method and returned the tool. Amazon was great with the return!
B0013WJT2E|5|Was in dire need of a air filter and hadn't even realized it.  You simply cannot go wrong with AC Delco products, I'll buy these over fram every day of the week.
B00L2PH5H8|5|Fits perfectly in 2010 KIA SOUL hub.<br /><br />Do not get the non-OEM Dorman 610-410.1 .  The dorman bevel is not tapered and the spline pitch does not match the original hub.  I had to order these Kia 51752-07000 lug studs after I found that the dorman's would not fit.
B00C5RBRA8|5|The sewer hose was a little stiff and took 2 of us to collapse it (could have been operator error). It's nice it can be joined easily with another length of hose.
B003VAYK3Y|5|This installed very well - Our only problem was getting the old jack off :). It works fine and seems as though it will last a long time.
B00DZUB2ZO|4|Look great exactly what I knew I was getting great quality looking forward to putting them actually on the car in the coming months
B00480BWCI|1|Not for class A motorhome this was the second set I've ordered my first set was crushed after 3 uses. I thought it was my fault because conditions were wet and slick. However just the first use on this new set and they are starting to compress as well and conditions are dry and cool.
B0013FMW84|5|Great for getting carbon from rings
B00KJ4W3AC|4|They look nice but were a little of a problem getting on.They were just a touch too big..took me about 45 minutes to put all 4 on...bvut would recommend,they look great.
B004PZT6H4|5|Surprisingly this item looked like it was going to be cheaply made.  To my surprise the item was not cheap at all.  It is actually really well made!
B001ARNN0G|5|The product works great. Seller delivered on time  thanks.
B00B9ETBGU|5|Worked great and a great price. Not sure how true the follwing is but this is what I was told by a locksmith, &#34;you need a special computer to get it programmed.&#34;
B004Y4QZKC|5|fits perfectly
B003NHH6LI|5|Works great on my 2004 Ram 1500 Hemi !!
B004A30F6M|4|Good price and fit
B000GVFCBU|3|Easy to install on my 01 TJ. Just remember to also buy the adapter harness. It didn't do anything to improve performance, that I can tell. But, it's working at least as well as the OEM coil.
B004GCR2VI|5|Exact fit for a 2000 vw beetle.
B0009JKI6I|5|Perfect fit and easy installation!  Installation was a breeze!
B00PJPHEBO|5|Great value. Communicates perfectly with Torque Pro.
B000M8SY0I|3|good for emergencies
B007NR4KI6|5|Got the job done.  Perfect match
B00609DEEO|4|It was too long but I was able to shorten it and make work.
B009FU5WR2|5|awesome
B00KZ3201O|5|I've used the TurboCord for about 1 month now and it works great.  Much better than the trickle charging cord that came with my Nissan Leaf!
B003YLMPPA|1|card only worked for a few days, then died completely  at least the factory one died over a 6 month period.  Now I only have max blower speed left.
B00BSAYMX2|5|Very nice quality. Very pleased.
B001H3PBV2|5|good
B00068XCQU|5|I wish I had gotten this tender sooner, it would have saved me towing fees and a new battery
B001O0GJ2I|4|These look good but not a solid lug time will tell dont over tighten
B00OU5LOT2|5|man these are awesome. they act like something that is $200. my mom couldn't believe i got them so cheap! did the very easy install of just plugging in the cig lighter. will recommend!
B009S954J6|5|Great
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Absolute best rags I ever used.  The more stuff I buy from Chemical Guys the more I want!  Awesome products!
B003B47APU|2|I have other Motive products and I really like them.  I purchased this adapter in order to help my neighbor with his Honda Ridgeline.  This adapter was a pain in the butt from the start.  The hooks and chains were a pain to connect to one another.  Getting the pressure even across the reservoir was an exercise in futility.  I ended up returning it because it was such poor design.
B00WAZZ3X2|5|Fast shipping. Exactly what I needed. Easy to install.
B006969RQM|5|Very good quality. I would and have recommended these to family and friends. And the wrench does tighten the caps securely.
B00030DLEE|3|it is ok this item not perfect item handle and close clip is veey bad and all ready broke two portable stove,black. make better dezine than this. thk you.
B0057GU3NQ|4|Good product
B0028JE430|2|Rusted after 1 year
B00290VEJA|4|much nicer than the other cheaper ones.
B0080E59CM|5|Good quality filter, has even more filtering surface (but still fits) that already good quality filter I had before. Skirt is made from rubber-like material, so it provides better air sealing.<br /><br />German company, made in South Korea.<br /><br />Got it on another site, with &#34;rock&#34; in its name.
B004SJQG84|2|Not nearly as &#34;brawny&#34; as described.  There was no fleece lining as stated, no piped seam (as shown in the picture), no &#34;raised letter&#34; logo, just thin silkscreening.  Fit was acceptable, but other than that, not a good value.  We were replacing a factory color-matched hard cover on our '06 SE destroyed in a rear-end collision and not available for replacement at any price, so this added insult to injury.
B00BFU8KV0|5|great replacement for original broken cover
B00I87GGPK|4|perfect OEM item but over priced compared to aftermarket.
B003YK96YO|5|Item was recieved on time and as advertised
B00BVT8RKY|5|Excellent
B00VJQ79KI|1|Only half the lights turned on. And the ones that did turn on weren't bright at all. Don't know if i just had bad luck, but had to return mine
B00460L6B2|5|Great repair for my motorhome.
B00ZC20NUS|4|This has just about everything you’d ever want for an emergency in a car, all conveniently put together into one tool. I won’t list all of the tools this has, since the description has it all, but rather this review will focus on how well they work. This tool does some things well, but others not so well.<br /><br />I’ll start with the good stuff. The main tool is the pressure gauge and it works flawlessly. You use it just like how you’d use a normal pressure gauge, but instead of a meter popping out, a number will display on the screen instead. You can change the units of measurement by pressing the mode button, and I personally prefer this over the standard meter, as it feels more accurate. Next, this tool also comes with a flashlight as well as a red blinking LED light for emergencies. Both of those are operated through a switch, and I can definitely see those being useful. Finally, there’s a window breaker which pops up in the back. I haven’t broken any windows with it, but it feels and looks like any other window breaker, so I’d assume it works.<br /><br />Now for the not-so-great stuff, which is pretty much every other tool (scissors, saw, etc.). All of these things are clumped together and stuffed into the middle, kinda like a massive swiss army knife. It’s nice that there are all these tools available, but because they’re so clumped together, it makes it super hard to get the right one out (unless they’re on the edge). It also makes it difficult to know which tool is the one you’re looking for.<br /><br />One last side note: the entire thing is powered by button batteries (included). I’m not sure how long the battery life is, but that is one thing to keep in mind, as these aren’t as common as AA or AAA batteries.<br /><br />Overall, this isn’t a bad tool–the pressure gauge, the lights, and the window breaker are all extremely useful in emergencies, and they all work well. It’s just all the other tools are kind of a mess.<br /><br />Please note that I was sent this product for review. Feel free to leave questions & comments below!<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />==The Good==<br />+ Pressure gauge works well<br />+ Huge variety of tools in a compact device<br />+ Useful for emergencies<br /><br />==The Bad==<br />- A lot of the tools are mushed together, making it hard to differentiate<br />- Powered by non-standard batteries, making replacement slightly more difficult.<br />Please note that I was sent this product for review.

B000BPSW7C|5|The only car wax I use...!
B007LICQ9M|1|will not fit in with a license plate frame
B0014FGVVW|5|Tool totally fixed my problem. What an awesome idea. Threads fixed in twenty minutes.
B000OI2DXU|4|Love the way they look, but one short strip of the 3M tape was missing. Not worth sending back, cheaper to buy the tape myself. Good looking vents though, and not the seller's fault
B00411QIJG|1|The mirrors were not convex, like motorcycle mirrors, So its like looking into the bathroom mirror
B00NPKDGEE|5|it is awesome and strong, does not break! just like they advertised.
B005T7PR8E|5|Very clear vision day or night!
B001KQD81Q|5|Great product! Perfect fit!!
B00P5RSX5M|5|LUV it!
B007I6RDW2|5|good product, fit my 2012 Honda Civic
B000N8GDT6|4|Expected the aluminum to be layered so it would compress. It's not layered at all. It's solid and flat and won't seal unless your collector plates are perfect
B008UR7J6I|1|It did not work for me, so it is not good.
B000BYD78W|1|THE AIR GAP MESSES WITH THE ECM..ENGINE WILL SKIP ON COLD MORNINGS..DO NOT USE DODGE 4.7 ENGINES
B00E7MPFHU|5|These are awesome...protect my eyes when riding...had trouble with watering eyes no matter what sunglasses or safety glasses I wore...Not any longer! And I look like a badass to boot!
B00X65LH9O|5|Fits very well and is very light.
B00K6L79K2|5|It fit perfectly in my 1984 Fleetwood Pace Arrow.  The opening had a width of approximately 4 1/2 inches and product description said 6.  I tried it based on another buyers picture so I'm including my pic of it.
B001MOVK9S|5|Saved $57 on a $20 item. Works perfectly and an exact match.
B000C81HF2|5|A+
B004HYSITA|5|fit and looks great!
B00EAOIKWC|5|Fit 2011 Chevy Cruze and Only took 5 minutes to switch out.
B00LU0UBH6|5|great addition to my cleaning tools
B00AZXBDY4|5|complete and easy tune up kit. I like the funnel lid, that was a good idea.
B0045LDEEY|5|So far, this battery has proven to be much better than the ones I previously have bought from local auto parts stores and it's significantly cheaper.
B00U6QFQAM|4|works as advertised, makes getting the hard top off a little easier.
B001DRNNGW|5|Will buy these every time I need them.
B00XBGQ91Y|5|In our home, between the bathroom door and the storage room door, we do not have a light and no power point for connection of a light as well. So that section is always dark even in daytime. I always wanted to have some sort of battery operated light there. I knew that since the light would be battery operated and kept on all the time, I would need to replace the batteries frequently.<br /><br />These Civilight battery operated wireless LED was a perfect solution I was looking for my problem. On the bonus side, it is motion activated which means there is no need to keep the light on entire day and it lights itself up as soon as we come near to it. This is useful as it ensures I won’t have to change batteries frequently. This civilight wireless LED Motion activated sensor light uses 3 AAA Batteries and I suggest either buying rechargeable ones or the better quality duracell types for longer battery life. Since the actual light is a LED as against the conventional bulb, you can expect far superior battery life and still good amount of brightness.<br /><br />The light this unit throws is a warm color yellowish, not fully daylight white light. The Mount of this and the rest of the light unit can be separated and there is a small square magnet (check picture) keeping both together. I will explain how to works. Since the light is 360 degrees rotatable, it won’t rotate like in a circular fashion but say it will go only North and South and pointing little bit on sides. Above is the case when the light switch is facing on the top.<br />Now if you want to have East west movement, you need to remove the entire light unit from the wall mount (just pull it) and the mount will stay on wall and unit will be in your hand. Now just put the light back in the mount but this time the switch should be on any one side. With this you can get the east west movement. This way 360 degrees rotation is achieved. I hope I was able to explain it properly. Just checked the pictures and I guess you do not need to do the above for 360 degree movement. My mistake.<br /><br />The switch on this light has 3 modes, ON - OFF - S. The first 2 are self explanatory and the<br />‘S’ basically means it is in “sensor” mode which you should keep this light on entire time. This way the light will glow only when it senses motion. Remember that in the ‘S’ mode when it glows, it will be full light while in the ON Mode, it is slightly dim.<br /><br />You can use these lights in pathways / stairs or in closets. Although the manufacturer has provided 2 mounting screws, I have used double sided 3M Tape to attach the light to my wall. The 3 AAA Batteries are not included. I don’t understand the color temperature and lumens stuff but this light provides 3000K color temperature warm light.<br />*I received this wireless LED motion activated light as a part of promotion in exchange of my honest and unbiased feedback and all opinions mentioned above are my own based on my usage of the light.
B008289558|4|Arrived on time and as expected fit correctly in my Scorpion 1100 helmet
B001KN6EKQ|4|Instructions were terrible, but things like this are easy for me to figure out, so it wasn't an issue...once installed, works great
B000BVRZ74|5|Use after Rain-X 5080217 X-treme Clean Glass Cleaner. Water beads up and runs off. AAAAA+++++
B00J7RB72M|4|besides breaking it in (which is the hard part on any of these) I love it. easy in and out grab and its still small enough to fit in between my front seats.
B003TTTIZ2|5|Good jugs
B00LEBLI82|5|Great bulb replacements, great price!
B00J08MA42|5|Nice fit
B003VEZSAO|5|My husband saw this and showed it from another car and asked me to find it; of course I would find it:)
B00BQP97NE|5|Fit perfect and easy installation
B000SL4A84|5|Everything you need in one small neat package
B001EGSTY8|5|Does what's supposed to!
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Great product. Works great so far and it appears to be easy to clean. Thanks guys!!!
B00W9OQW7U|1|Did not shine well. Looks like the beam is vertical if you shine on a wall. My streamlight flashlight produces same amount of light
B00LTU1QYO|5|Prior tenants got a cap stuck in the sink drain and for the life of me I haven't been able to get it out for the last 4 years. Bought these and they did exactly what I needed them for.
B003KW7J54|5|This is the finest aluminum polish I have ever used. Better than Nuvite or any other IMHO.
B00NRVDS4E|5|Fit good works great. Great customer service, they go above and beyond to make sure you're happy.
B00BFDFYT8|5|Very nice product for a good price.
B00HDERBLC|3|Plug receptacle was loose fitting, which is to bad as I really liked the aluminum lightweight design. Unfortunately, I will be returning it fit that reason.
B0057VWU1E|5|Works equally great to wash my motorcycle and my car without a drop of water. Perfect!
B007KLT8SM|5|The yellow looks awesome with my yellow yamaha V1 waverunner.  Very nice quality too!
B000K046G4|5|As described
B00KDO3O0Q|5|Love them!
B00T9YQVGA|5|excelente
B001DVPDPC|4|husband was pleased
B0019BXM18|5|beautiful when i pulled it out of the box no scratches got to me alot faster than i thought it would looks great on my truck and was easy to install just wish they would have sent the back up nuts for mounting
B00IB1XGRO|5|they lookk great, as long as nothings causes them to fall off.
B001NZZAG0|5|Words can 't be enough to tell if you are satisfied or not. All I know is I order the Fuel Pump and it was all good! It was the same as the original equipment. The price was the best around . I'm driving the truck with the new fuel pump.I feel lucky that I order the fuel pump for the price that I paid.
B00CAYECNU|4|Work smooth and quiet.
B00BQYCJNU|4|worked verywell
B00CS8HBH2|1|cheap and too much work for the product
B000CB6FNI|2|too expensive for what it is.
B003G0KCCM|5|Great Fit.  Holds all the dirt I can throw at them.
B000IBDIX2|3|So far so good no problems with it yet
B004VT8CTM|5|I am not the end user (purchased them for my boyfriend's birthday), but he said these are the best LED lights he's ever seen and they're a killer price! I have to say they look great too!<br />By the way, the truck that I was purchasing them for was right at the &#34;will they fit?&#34; point, a 2006 GMC Sierra Crew Cab, and they fit perfectly!
B00S1KHJQO|1|The cv shafts were damaged upon receival. One of the cotter pin holes was not machines properly and could only fit half of the cotter pin thru the hole once mounted.
B0091OE6K6|1|didn't work that good
B00FBPOXZ2|5|nice quality and I like the storage bag.
B0016H0O6G|5|I used this on my tailgate extender on my truck for my kayak. Now the people tailgating me can see my brake lights. Lights are bright, plenty of wiring, everything you need for a simple trailer wiring kit.
B0002D6K86|3|Gets warm, but VERY FLIMSY!
B009M9XK20|5|Works great :()
B000CFO0GI|5|Perfect, just what we needed, we did not install, but rather had one of their authorized dealers install it.
B009J6AAGU|5|Ozium is the only air sanitizer that I have tried that eliminates smoke odor, not just cover it up.
B005JU5VH8|5|For use on drivers side. Perfect fit. AAAAA+++++
B00CF2810W|5|I just ordered these for the head lights for my truck off of amazon they said they fit, when I received them they did not,  I contacted opt-7 and they narrowed it down that indeed they were for my truck but for the fog lights, I was wanting them for my headlights but you know what they are so bright ill just use them on my fog lights. Now my lights will match the same color as my head lights which will look better, the company is outstanding in helping me out. I look forward to putting more opt-7 lights on my truck.
B000HPLTEY|1|Instructions were not clear on how it was supposed to be installed. The item was said to fit my Ford Contour. The item didn't fit my car. I returned it and amazon was awesome for refunding my money and returned shipping!
B0027ZZRF4|4|stops great not sure about the low dust spec
B00E6AB50Y|2|the heartagram was off centered.
B00K6D9KCA|5|Quick shipping. Exactly as advertised.
B00YIA2VH8|5|Bought it for my wifes car, she love it and it makes a huge difference with the internal temperature of the car; not nearly as hot after sitting in the hot sun.
B00FLFQ4MM|4|Bought to replace stock unit that I thought was having issues.  It works well and the fit was pretty good.  Bought for 2002 F150 Supercrew.
B00ATTQUO2|3|It needed another half a quart.
B007QBWVM6|5|good product
B00BRXPEF0|5|yes good
B00EC2CG9U|3|I purchased these to prevent our bike tires from spinning on our truck-mounted rack. Only giving it 3 stars because it only helped with 1 of the bikes. We have 2 Giant ATX 27.5 mountain bikes, one a small frame and one a large frame. I wanted to loop the cord through the front tire then around the diagonal bar to prevent the front tire from spinning on the highway. The cord was long enough to secure the tire on the small frame, but not the large. I am 5'2&#34; with the small frame and my husband is 6' with the large frame.
B000CH8P62|5|Just what I needed for my 2007 Tahoe.  After researching the internet, the compressor started to cycle on and off all the time.  My research suggested that it was this low pressure switch.  Replaced it in less than 5 minutes and that included collecting tools.
B001JT34NQ|4|It came without the set screw to hold the antenna in place. It is not a big deal to replace the screw but whoever has the parts quality control job needs to pay attention. Other reviews had the same issue. It is able to be tuned but not without a trip to the hardware store for a set screw.
B00BNIOH84|5|Works perfectly!! Keeps your EZPass out of site and sticks great to the windshield.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great fit!!!!
B000BQU24C|4|Exactly what I was looking for, can't always find nets with metal hooks. Most have plastic hooks that aren't as durable.
B0039752R2|5|Many reviews about the generic packaging, but mine was very well packaged, albeit without the 3M box shown. 2 rolls were on a stiff spindle like shipping a film, box was more than amply sized. 3M shows different product numbers for the individually boxed rolls vs. cases.  The photo shows the individual packaging, but this number is for a case, which the seller broke up for individual sale. Fine by me, price was very good. Not worried about the product, but not looking forward to taking my car apart to use it (replacing both side windows).
B005EV24BI|5|look great really dresses up the car
B00B9Z8DM2|3|These are stick on letters. They work but they aren't factory ones where you use emblem glue. They work and look fine tho. Just depends what you want.
B000E8XFCS|3|After 75,000 miles on my 2001 Tahoe I decided that this was something I could replace myself and save a few bucks.  The filters that my mechanic had previously installed were from Napa.  Honestly I like the Napa filters better than the Purolator filters I just installed.  I like Purolator products in general, they make top shelf oil filters for instance, but in this instance I felt the Napa part was the better choice.    I know Purolator boasts of having electrostatically charged, multiple layered filter fiber in their filter - and that's great - and you may need that if you're the boy in the bubble.  I'm not.  I usually drive with the windows down and am breathing the same air that goes through this filter.  The reason I think that there are better filters available is that after installing the Purolator I noticed that there were gaps around the edges of the filter element that would let unfiltered air move on through my HVAC system.  The Napa filters that I removed are banded with open cell foam about 1/8\\" thick that is easily compressible to serve to fill such gaps.  Micron filtration isn't worth s*** if it lets bugs through!    I'll be using either Napa or Delco parts next time.
B000BRQ0TW|5|Everything was wonderful!
B005C2BZLY|4|Great value. They are a blue white as others have noted. Worked great
B000WJF3GU|4|Youll need to buy oil. You can use this filter by it self. Make sure to buy filter oil also. The filter and service was 5 stars
B00RV46YBC|5|These bulbs are great, and give a nice unique touch to your car/truck. Bought 2 for my dads 2007 f250 to go with an hid kit and it looks really good. On bulb did fail, but I contacted jdm astar and the sent a replacement. No flickering or anything weird and they are extremely bright. The white gets cancelled when you use your indicators so it's not yellow-white-yellow. It's yellow-  yellow-  And so on.
B0110CO95S|5|the stickers I got were awesome, ripped a little easy but I sticker bombed my binder and it looks awesome, Audrey Hepburn, ray ban, Nike, vans, supreme stickers great quality aside from two I ripped taking the bank off impatiently
B007OX6E3S|5|works well
B004X5QM4G|1|I purchased this for a 1999 dodge ram 1500. The fittings don't match and had to take it back out.  Am going to have to order one from somewhere else
B00G3L42OU|5|Yes it did, was easy to install and worked just fine after starting up my motorcycle.
B0017KOPPS|4|Had to wrap around twice
B001UC9GHU|5|Moog is the best, I never install anything but moog chassis parts on my vehicles!
B004TMP18G|5|I was having trouble with hard shifting with my '99 Chev Lumina.  I use this vehicle for a rural mail route -90 miles a day/5days a week.  I tried this after hearing a radio commercial touting the results I could receive.  My car had about 130k miles on it then and I've been driving it since the addition of Xado and it's been amazing.  No knocks, no hard jerky shifts, and my gas mileage has improved.  Gallons at the pump decreased by over a gallon a day.  I tried this with my 99' Chev Tahoe and had even better results with gas mileage and I have to buy gas every day.  I'd say an average of $3 a day depending on cost of gas that day....love it.  I'm getting another supply as I've put on 60k on my truck.  My Lumina, however, runs like a champ but the body is nasty.  It's being retired tomorrow, :(
B009F59HR8|4|works great,good price
B003U2OUI8|5|Got this for my dads jeep. He really liked it. Looks good
B000NOZEHC|5|Great product
B00FP74O5K|5|I had this on my last truck and liked it so much I put it on my new truck.  That right there is a testimony to how good it is.  My one complaint is that the metal latch would line up better.  Sometimes I have to shift the closing end of the over the right a little to get the latch to grab.  I quick dremel will fix that right up,. though.
B004VXJ73I|3|my girlfriend used this on her jeep. im not sure if she got the right color, but i don't think it matched to well.
B005DN5L4O|3|I recently sold the Chevy Duramax that I installed this on.  The only reason it gets 3 stars is because these things don't last long.  It was almost an annual task to change these out with a new one.  Maybe they have gotten the issue fixed with this probe, but I think it's the same one.
B000C122RG|5|Easy to install, but just a bit noisier than the original. Fast delivery too
B0024NSLMA|3|quality and fit could have been better
B00PQ2AXMC|5|Bought for my son and he loves it.
B000W0PMRE|4|This is a very thick cable. Would have given it 5 stars but 1 of the 3 keys broke the second day I had it.  The key with the light on it is very fragile. I use this with my Thule rack and wrap it around the bike twice so it would be very hard to cut this twice and also break the Thule lock.  I would buy again but the key and locking mechanism could be higher quality.  A great design if they fix these two things.  Also this is a covered cable makin it harder to cut. Regular bolt cutters would have a tough time on this but a cutting wheel would defeat. The lock is recessed which would make it hard to pick.
B006JG5BG2|5|Efficient, powerful, not as noisy as the stock pump on Chevy Cruze Eco. Smaller than I thought. I keep it under the front passenger seat, and my wife never noticed it.
B000C976CE|5|great product
B00074Q2A6|4|Seems to really cut down on movement in front of our fifth wheel and makes it feel more secure.  Sets up quickly and easily. Glad we made this purchase.
B00CMOUIT0|4|I installed this product a month ago on my F250 crew cab 4X4 powerstroke with no issues so far. I was not sure with the price being so good I wasn't expecting a lot, but so far it's all good.
B000COB8FA|5|Good product
B00K850T3U|5|Great
B001HBL1EA|5|AWESOME
B0000AXPDU|1|Keys are cheap. Hard to pull out of the lock and a broken key is the last thing you want if you need the spare. Don't think it will last even if the keys worked well.
B00EEDOWU8|4|Be aware that that your OBD port can only output so much power at a time. This worked fine while I needed it, but noticed some faint flicker on my Cobb AccessPort V3 screen when using this splitter.
B007MI5SDW|5|Works great on the back of the 4 wheeler. It was a little smaller than expected but made well.
B00IUCK8P2|5|They look really nice haven't put them on yet though I will soon
B000C5WD08|4|It was easy to install and did what it said.
B0016HZZ0Q|5|Sounds great! Just like new again.
B00BITKRXW|5|A perfect fit and easy to install.  Great price!!
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Working well, programming was very easy..
B006WQS4MC|5|Well, glad to say I did not pass any radar cars testing this,smooth and quite.
B002M9LBIC|4|We like this product.  We have found it works better when the wheel/rim is washed with Dawn or degreaser and a wheel brush with warm or hot water to remove most of the road film,and brake dust.  When this product is used as a final cleaner and protectant it works very well and puts that finishing touch, showroom type finish, you desire.
B00FSC8Z0C|5|plug and play, nothing else to do.  Would suggest new &#34;retainer sleeves&#34; also(most just crumble when removed).<br />I however was able to hold it in place with a couple rubber O-rings
B00P3TLOH6|5|Works good nice and strong I think it will last me a long time
B002SSGAZG|4|It definitely did the job.
B00JZQXJ3K|4|I will start with the bad and follow by listing the obvious good:<br />Bad:<br />Tyger supplied quality hardware with the product, however the loose nuts cause assembly to be about 5 times more difficult than it has to be.  It is a pain to get the washers and locknuts threaded onto the bolts as there is less than 1inch of clearance between the inside of the bumper and the hitch.  Many other suppliers have the nuts welded to the hitch to avoid this pain.  Another problem with loose nuts is that the installer must hold the nuts while tightening the bolts with a large torque wrench (to get to the recommended ~110 ft.-lbs.).  The only thing that fits on the nut side is an open ended wrench.  So you are forced to react 110 ft.-lbs. from the 1.5ft long torque wrench with a 8in wrench.<br /><br />Good:<br />Harness of high quality and is completely plug and play<br />Hitch of good material<br />Coatings appear to be well done and of high quality<br />PRICE ($300 less than factory, $20 less than any competition)<br /><br />That being said, I highly recommend this product!
B007OW6MD6|5|Genuine OEM parts, what more could you ask for
B00TKIWVL4|4|Purchased in the first stage just after my bike arrived. Fits perfectly at back sides. Easy enough to install yourself. Afrer install this you will want the rear rack! This set made by Givi as will!
B00OKSY2FW|5|Very easy to install. FIt perfect.
B00K6DNGSY|5|Great quality, didnt fit my 2014 Rubicon the way I would have liked. Upon installing, you could see the entire undercarriage. Just not my preference, but maybe domeone elses
B0038R8CYI|5|Not<br />Bad for money
B00390BS7C|5|Very useful. Almost required to replace some of these o2 sensors.
B00B8B6F68|5|Just right Thank you
B00AMPJ554|5|Nice! Best bang for your buck.
B00E2UMX40|4|Was good fit well All nice new ford parts Did how ever take a few day to ship so make sure u plan accordingly
B00HB2M7HO|4|Seems to seal well. Waiting for cold weather to see how well it performs. That is why I purchased it.
B001CEG90I|3|I think the charcoal restricts the air flow a little going to order without next time
B00JSJMV38|4|Nice quality
B00VNFW7KW|5|I orderedthis product and recieved it in a very respectable time. I found the seat belt extender to be made of a sturdy material and when I hooke it up in my Ford 2012 F-250 it was not noticable unless you took a real good look. I really didn't need the extendsion, but it made it easier to hook in my belt because I didn't have to go digging for the original one. A quick sidenote; If you want to shut down that annoying beeping from not having your seatbelt connected, this will do it. I highly recommend this product and will be buying one for my 2015 Kia Optima. Hope this was helpfulto you all.
B000C9IXUI|5|awesome
B003UIO4J2|2|Good ship time. After about an hour of trying to install headlight, a 5 minute job. Thinking body panel were mis-alligned after a deer hit. Looked at new light to see that bolt holes were formed about a half inch from where they should have been. Just missed reinforced section of plastic. Drilled in right spot and it fit right in. SMH.
B0070Y36N2|1|Too thin, does not hold plate down
B0018PXX2I|1|Followed instructions.  Ended up using whole can inadvertently on one surface.  Did absolutely nothing except dissolve paint on the can and turn my hands blue.  Customer service was rude and unwilling to refund or give credit.  I will rethink my continued use of Permatex products.
B00RJM6PK6|5|Amazing Deep Muscle car sound !!! and Super Aggressive and Very Loud under freeway underpasses !!! Lol
B008K5ME9C|4|My 2015 Ruck sounds great thanks to this exhaust. If your looking into a Yoshimura exhaust I would definitely check this one out. It's a little cheaper and honestly I think It sounds better. The mounting bracket did not line up with the mounting hole in the exhaust which is why I give it four stars but other than that it's great! Only took 15 minutes to install.
B00U83AZOA|4|It was a wonderful experience,  definitely will shop again soon.  Thanks
B001B7A2L8|5|Very affordable and a very, very easy install got the air conditioning in my 1994 Endeavor working again! Very cool product.
B004GCNNHA|5|Good product, very economical
B00IT9MBV0|1|I received this sticker as a birthday gift on Tuesday. I put it on my car yesterday, and as of this morning, it is 100% discolored. What an absolute waste of time and money. Terrible quality. Very disappointing
B000C5I3ZW|2|not installed
B0009IBJAS|2|regular
B004QHLG4W|4|Easy to install.  I applied a thin layer of anti-seize where the hub fits into the knuckle. Only time and miles will tell if these hubs are any good.
B004I1220S|5|It's what I needed and expected.
B000GZKYVO|5|Fits perfectly
B001B5E0N6|5|Great parts,price,service
B00TI9OFFU|5|This s a GREAT cover.  It fits my car like a glove and it has yet to lift, or get blown off the car because of wind.  The previous cover I had was made by a different company altogether, but the thing made me furious because it wouldn't stay on the car even with a light breeze.  However this, with its elastic band which stretches comfortably to the ends of my vehicle, is perfect.  I almost wish I had the need for a second one!
B005N6X7L0|5|I love these shirts!,, I want more choices!!!!
B001C6LG3Q|5|Great quality pump, works great.  Great deal.
B001AGNCKS|5|I bought some bad gas in another state coming home from vacation and tried replacing the fuel filter, using gas line water remover, fuel system cleaner, etc. to fix the poor performance but nothing seemed to work.  The local GM mechanic said the problem was the catalytic converter and would cost over $1,300.00 to replace.  I was skeptical, since these usually last for the life of the car.  When I bought this and replaced it, however, the difference was amazing and immediate!  My car runs like new again!  The quality was incredible, and it was a perfect fit!  As other reviewers have mentioned, though, you need to save the bolts from the old one since new ones are not included and also need to buy the gasket for about 4 bucks but this is still a great value.  Definitely 5 stars!
B004FI325I|5|Love it! Exactly what I thought it was going to be. Great length as well.
B00WYNSR6K|1|Incredible difference. I spend a lot of time waiting in the heat and sun at practices for kids. This made a huge difference
B00PO4AN5Y|5|This is not a matt finish. It seems more reflecting than without it but significantly less fingerprint. I satisfied with my purchase.
B004AHQ558|5|Easy to install! Makes my used car I just purchased smell brand new again!
B00YGUZ20I|1|While the double sided tape stuck to the car well, it did not stick to the rubber guard. As soon as the car was in the sun the rubber piece fell off leaving the double sided tape which was very difficult to remove from the car.
B010C7MUOE|4|fit my camper bumper perfectly with some room to spare
B00E9BEB7O|5|Super good service and great looking product!
B0066QU7PU|1|This switch fails at least once a year. I should have just purchased the OEM switch as the cost of changing this five times has surpassed the OEM cost.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Look at it, Need I say more?<br />It's inexpensive, and it's Awesome!
B00CJUW3HW|5|Easy to peel and stick, durable, and well priced
B00PJOIA8Q|5|I bought this to wrap the exhaust on my 2006 CBR1000RR. I need this because my race plastic runs too close to the exhaust and was melting the paint off. I previously had it wrapped with DEI standard wrap. I had to remove it to do some work to the bike and it all just fell apart. It also was letting too much heat through and still bubbling the paint.<br /><br />I decided I wanted to upgrade to a higher end wrap. I looked at the DEI Titanium wrap and this stuff. I decided to give this stuff a try, based on price, to see how it worked. So far it seems to be working fine. I have not had to remove it yet so I don't know if it will also fall apart like the standard DEI did. The paint is no longer bubbling either.<br /><br />So far I am happy with it. If that changes for any reason I will update this review.
B006QH54WU|5|Fast ship, good price. Time will tell performance.
B001ONXJQ4|3|There ok they didn't fit like the original
B002S07F76|5|They met my expectations .
B00ES5Q7KA|5|Very easy to install and fits perfectly.  Got it for the rear window of a 2005 Honda Odyssey.  I couldn't find one in stores but it was easy to find and order via Amazon.  Price is great for a Bosch.
B00ZVQDUSC|5|I am very happy with it
B00VSHS2J0|5|excellent
B00EZQ6UC2|4|Braappp best gloves
B000CMJS6I|4|Just what I wanted to replace the original connector which I had ground off when it fell on the ground while I was towing it.
B001JT5R4U|4|worked as advertised.
B006GJKZL8|4|After turning a new set of stock springs in to a big &#34;S&#34; and breaking my rear Dana 35 Axle, I installed these in the rear only... At the same time I Installed a Ford 8.8 and a MORE TB500 Traction Bar. These do sit about 1.5&#34; taller. If you are doing a SOA, get some sort of traction or anti-wrap bar to save yourself from blowing these springs.<br /><br />Going wheeling soon, I will update on if they survived. I tend to break things.
B000AS3D42|5|perfect OEM part
B002OWCLNQ|4|As expected.  Only complaint is that it is harder to remove for cleaning than more recent updated models.
B00C5SIEQ2|4|Did the job.  Strainer is flimsy.
B00L6NTI58|3|Had to cut the back part of my headlight covers and replace the plugs provided on the initial wiring which lead to me breaking some of the parts included.  Took a minor level of knowledge to install correctly overall though and they have been working reliable since.
B000C4087Y|5|vg
B00HLAEJJK|5|Cheaper than every where else and works.
B00LNJI1KI|5|Haven't had time to mount it but hooked it up and its bright
B00JIEX722|5|The bulbs arrive quickly and they were perfect for what we needed in our travel trailer.  I would recommend buying your LED bulbs from JDM ASTAR.  I know we will again.  Thank you for your fair prices too!!
B000KITSMI|4|Will only work for the low pressure side of a C5 Vette.  I had to repair the drift pin which fell out in my hand with a small brass brad.  Not worth returning over.  Otherwise a nice built piece for &#34;hot tapping&#34; valve replacement.  The high pressure Schrader on GM is huge so even tho' the quick release fitting provided would work the internal slot is way too small to fit on that valve.  So if you have to replace the High side you will have to depressurize the system first at least on my car.
B00O6WPVXY|5|JUST FINE
B00BCRMBGQ|1|It said it would fit my car model but it didn't at all.
B0073WDPEQ|4|Looks great.
B009WEV5AO|5|Super comfortable and they look great
B00VFPOF1E|4|excellent quality tool, just limited in its applications because of the large size of the pins and not interchangeable.
B005O023CO|5|Great experience will definitely use again. Thanks
B003FO2O1G|5|Excellent, tripled the number of TV channels we were able to get.
B00Q348590|5|Just like picture.
B001CF1A7O|5|Very solid.  I installed on the front of my tractor using a welded on 2 inch receiver hitch.
B00PRVVZ5G|5|Bloody bright..fitted on my Landcruiser 100 series (2001).. No issues..except for on coming traffic at night :P good product..solid..quality 👌
B009VOQ05U|5|Compared to other HIGH PRICED units, this does the same thing at a great price. Looks good too.
B001KO5JEW|4|5 stars for the vendor with a great price and incredibly fast delivery. 4 stars for the product which works well but took too much modification to fit. It was advertised as being made for my specific bike. Close but not perfect.
B00HTOB0NG|5|As advertised, I can always trust kensun products to do what they say they will do. Great products and prices.
B00D3298A0|4|Has a bad rubber smell to it
B00X6DMWMM|5|Will keep my Toyota Sienna clean from mud rain and spills
B008Y3P2HG|5|yes good
B0071EAR4W|5|Just installed this grill overlay on my 2013 chevy suburban . Looks great! Only took seconds to mount. Fits perfectly over your existing grill. I'm not handy at all, but anyone can install this item. The plastic pieces that snap in to secure it, were covered in stirofoam squares to protect them from breaking . Great product for the price. Better than I expected.
B00DTV5VR4|5|Very nice
B00QK123QC|5|love it
B00WQHMMVK|4|Very nice keeps drinks n all other goodies cold colder if used with ice pack
B0037J7TQ4|5|Perfect fit worth the investment
B002ZTM82W|5|They work perfectly on my 2007 XLR sportster.
B00FAE6D20|5|great tools
B001GJ3FIS|5|Like it
B00W5XTTNO|1|too little
B00E9BEBB0|1|Has holes for led lights that aren't in photo
B000C2SIQE|2|This did not fit my 1999 stock Suburban with 7.4 engine, as the Amazon search engine suggested.<br /><br />But Gates is what my mechanic suggested and, when it fits, I'm sure it's a great belt.
B003RYOWH8|4|Not bad for the price. It is still too soon to talk about the quality and durability though. It was a little tricky but I made it work to cover my Honda Odyssey middle seats. For that price it is hard to ask for more.
B006X8C826|5|great
B00PP79NAQ|5|I used this on a 2005 Jeep Wrangler hard top.  Replaced the old bolts, many were already missing.  They work great, I don't miss pulling out the star wrenches one bit
B00842A7F4|5|Great product and good price
B0050IS69O|5|Husband loves it.
B0082365AQ|5|Whoelch!! The other reviewers had mentioned the stench, but I was no where close to being prepared for it. This thing smells like a cat took a whiz on a box of moth balls then lit it on fire. It's like the devil farted on burning plastic and hair from the '80s. The box says it's from China; it doesn't mention that it's from the Center of Hell. Probably from a factory that makes artificial armpit odor and arsenic-laced patchouli. My godness, I feel so sorry for those poor people who live in that Chinese village! Their nostril hairs are probably fried completely off not to mention their eyeballs. I threw away the box it came in and the garbage man who picked it up passed out when he opened the can. The guy had to take sick leave after fighting with that thing. The cart's been sitting outside in the rain for the last couple days but it still smells like C3-PO vomited out some burning earwax and car parts—like someone sprayed it with jet fuel and liquefied cow dung. This could be a job for vinegar or a strong solvent, but I don't want to accidentally blow up my town in a chemical reaction.<br /><br />Works pretty good for my kayak though.
B00UCTY9F6|5|GREAT PRICE. ORDER THESE ALL THE TIME FOR THE CAR LOT I WORK FOR.
B000E495E4|1|Didn't fit . Sucked . All wrong
B000C41I4Q|5|Very happy with the power steering pump.
B000C9FJGE|5|The motor arrived one day ahead of schedule and in working condition. Removal and installation of the motor was easy, approximately 30-40 to complete. There are 3 screws that hold the unit the one nearest the firewall can be difficult to get too. This is my third time ordering from Amazon, no compliants so far. Happy Customer!
B00KWVYJDG|1|sucked
B000CB6D1W|5|Perfect fit
B00PMN23H8|4|Really long
B004EK94P4|5|Great Deal!
B004RFKBEO|5|Very good bike hauler. Not sure why people had a tough time putting it together in the previous comments? My 12 year old son had it put together before I had a chance to help him. Lol. Good bang for the buck.
B00A7MT49O|1|monroe site said this would fit 2001 galant.  This too did not fit the mount.
B000COCRHS|4|My door closes now.  Easy to install.
B004GE9QEW|1|Would not buy again! It was supposed to be a direct replacement part. It was not! We had to cut it to make it work. Cheaper than buying it at the dealer but not worth the hassle!
B00JPAHIVU|1|Incorrect connector and failed after 5000 miles. Bought a second one, exactly the same as the first. Both damage the battery, the second broke the ECU and the battery got so hot it broke the seal and sprayed steam (acid?) into the battery compartment.
B002DU3S9A|4|as described. Thanks!
B007HRN650|5|work great
B000BQYH6Q|5|as described. Thanks!
B003WOZOUM|2|It is great, if it doesn't rain.
B008A5XWGQ|2|Not as advertised in photo. The remote i received does not have a trunk release.
B00UJGBQUI|4|Did as I expected.  It would have been much better with some documentation, or a link to same.  In my case, I had read about the circuit in several different articles, and knew what to do and what to expect; but 2 or 3 pages would make it much more popular, and probably increase sales.
B0027VT0I8|5|Great! I use it to power refrig in my TT when traveling. Works Great. Thanks KC
B00XZ9OGTO|5|easy to program
B00XL71FHG|5|Very satified!
B00ULPXJRU|3|Everything seems fine however it only came with 4 head rest covers when the picture shows 5 (the one i am missing is the middle head rest)
B005JV891M|5|Great helmet! fits well and pretty well priced.
B0085G9V7E|5|I love the way this looks on my truck.  Put it on a 2002 F150 Supercrew to replace my stock unit.  I am not sure if the light is as bright as the stock or not, but I love the colors it puts out and it looks awesome!  Installation was a breeze for me - partially remove the headliner at the back of the cab, unhook the old, hook up the new, replace headliner.  I have a sliding rear window in my truck, so I literally opened it and stuck my head through the window to do the job.  All said an done, took about 10 minutes (I cleaned the area as well, because I'm weird!).
B000F0QSJ2|5|It fit really well.  Way cheaper then changing my cracked dashpad
B001IF2BDU|4|Ram build four cab styles. The Regular cab. The Extended cab. The Crew cab. and the Mega cab. There is a difference in the extended and crew cab models. I assume that is why people are giving bad reviews. The rear ones fit perfectly. The front ones, on the other hand, were less than perfect.<br /><br />I always put these on my trucks. They are great products. I have always been pleased with them. To put the front ones on, I had to remove the cover for the mirror mounts, and loosen the bolts, It was just easier. But after the shades were put all the way to the front, they missed the back of the window opening by about an inch. It's not a huge deal, but I definitely can see it, and it bugs the crap out of me. The rear ones fit like a Trojan.
B00S09T8M4|5|i don't like it, i love it love it love it, oh ow...
B0091I1OBQ|3|As this is made up of amorphous silicon cell, the ratio of size to power output is bigger. works only in complete sun light. If you wanna buy, buy mono crystralline silicon cell depends upon the usage check it should be water proof
B00SK49JNM|1|The light bar itself is great the wiring harness is junk or at least the one I received was. And also the clicker switch it comes with should have been a regular toggle switch. The wiring harness it came with when I had it all hooked up everything I connected my negative battery post back up and the whole inside of my brand new 2013 ram 1500 was filled with smoke. After I got it to quit smoking I took the harness out to inspect it and inside the wire loom going to the swith are 3 of the smallest gauge wires I've ever seen. I believe the wire was to small for the load the led light bar put on it and that's what caused it to get to hot and smoke. It nearly caught my new truck on fire and I'm not to happy about that. I would not recommend it because of the fact it comes with such a cheaply made harness. And FYI I did have everything hooked up properly.
B00GURQF5Q|2|I received refund one bearing was bad would lock up when turned by hand !
B00XMBZY8C|1|I could leave less than one star I would. I purchased multiple lights none of them lasted more than a couple of weeks they all have condensation in them the customer service is a joke
B00C7Y7MLC|3|Had to learn how to align the inside of the door handle mechanism but it went in okay functions decently but not as well as the stock one
B000NHWP3K|5|nice i used it all the time
B007V2D07U|5|Perfect fit! They keep my jeep much cooler than without using it!
B00027H0LS|5|perfect
B00YJL8SXW|5|It's was perfect product for my job make my job easier
B00GZ748LO|3|Somewhat satisfied with purchase. Excellent customer service, maybe somewhat better than the actual product itself. Or maybe it's buying HID's is a crapshoot... some work and some don't. I would give Kensun/SDX 10 stars for customer service, as they are always there for you and want to make things right, but the initial product doesn't always seem to want to work. They will work with you as far as making sure you install it properly and troubleshoot all problems, and will determine what part may need to be replaced.
B00SQV81J2|5|Fits right in place of the original, However, moves the adjuster up above the heat shield, exhaust, and drive shaft.  This is on a 1996 audi a4 quattro
B003BZD03K|1|It worked fine on the back of my washer for about a month but then started leaking.  Very disappointed
B00S756SVK|5|I also installed the Innovited Premium AC Canbus HID on my 2013 Chevy Volt successfully, and had the same good experience as the previous two Volt reviews.  One thing to add if you are a Volt owner:  Watch the YouTube video first before installation: &#34;HID Installation Chevy Volt&#34;, as the dust caps should be modified.
B000CB6D0S|4|Exactly what I ordered. Now my car smells better.
B001ABPKUS|5|Easily installed. No vibration on a long trip.
B00INARF0C|3|does not fit good at all. way to loose. also very easy to bend.needed to be made out of real stainless steel
B001D9DP0E|1|I am being charged return fees for an item that was supposed to fit my vehicle but does NOT!<br /> It was stated that this item fit my 2001 F150 Ford truck, but will not and I feel it's unfair to charge me for your mistake.
B00UIO4J7I|5|as advertised
B000E28MCM|5|I needed a &#34;tee ftg&#34; that would accept 5/16 fuel line and this was the only one I could find. I needed 1 but had to buy 12 just to get one (only received 11) Good quality, as I tried to break one of the extra ones just to see how durable they are and couldn't break one with my hands. If I live long enough for 10 more vintage motocross projects I will have all my &#34;tee ftg&#34; problems covered.
B001FIKNJY|5|worked great
B009TI5B3U|4|I like it...especially the suction cup power. It could of also came with a dash mount adhesive disc.
B0042OX8WC|5|Works as it should. Affordable.
B00CPQ1LHI|5|Thank you!
B00MZUT71G|5|Great piece
B003AL23TC|5|This has saved my campers electrical system.  The campground we visit often has issues with it's power.  I had no power, my neighbor had 78 volts in his camper. Another camper had it's inverter/converter burn up due to the poor voltage.  No regrets with this purchase.  Highly recommend.
B002LEK7QU|5|Was nicely package with no scratches on it. I love the lettering. Recommend this to any Aggies out there :-)
B00GXS3726|4|Very satisfied even though the light on 1 switch doesn't work....very well made and put together.
B000HBM5TQ|5|I like it
B00P1N8QU2|5|Very happy with product. Bought to use around the kitchen and bathroom. They are great!
B00DZBONZO|5|Thanks
B005FFT9IE|5|I love these products,except I haven't ever been able to put the back seat floor mat in the car because of the console, it won't fit.
B000CITK8S|5|Great charger. Got this for my motorcycle. Works fine.
B00O6WPVXY|5|This is as good as any of the replacement filters, very reasonable price ($31 at Amazon as of this writing) vs. auto parts stores $50+.  If you have changed one of these yourself then you know dealing with the filters large o-ring is a major pain.  That o-ring just will not sit in position until you get it placed at the filter housing to attach it - no matter if you use oil, deisel or grease to help hold it.  For me the best way to do it is to also stretcchhh the o-ring a couple times like a rubber band - not TOO much or you will damage or even break it !!!!  It will then sit in place for a minute, maybe two, before rubber &#34;memory&#34; causes it to pull in and buckle out of position.  Stretching will only give you a short time to get it in place so don't lollygag around.  Also you have to push the filter up into the fuel filter housing agressively to get the threads of the two parts to meet so you can spin it on.  One more note - don't forget the fuel bleeder screw o-ring.  Those plastic bleeder screws are a joke (get a metal replacement) but the o-ring ages and needs replacement too.  Mine is a 2003 Duramax and that o-ring developed an air leak causing hard-acceleration hesitation, reduced power, hard start and no start issues.
B0045MYF32|4|Works as advertised. Seem to be good quality.
B00UHDTORA|5|works grate
B00192KZQ2|5|Helpful in making sure tank is clean. Easy installation and satisfied with purchase. Wish I knew about it sooner.
B00V6XPTV0|1|I've purchased item twice and it's still not enough trim to complete my doors.
B0043AV4NK|5|Nice looking exhaust tip. Makes my car look great.
B007QBKBM8|5|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. I was doing a complete brake replacement (pads, calipers & hoses). What I liked about these over stock, they are painted so it will keep the rust at bay (for how long who knows). Like my other posts, if nervous about doing this yourself, youtube has great videos for the do it youselfer. Replacing these are incredibly easy, the hardest part may be removing the old ones. The best part, Amazon price can’t be beat!
B00EP3PW4M|5|Easy to install, nice for the price.
B00X9E0HRK|4|Mgotu has this 12v auxiliary twin power plug end that is quite useful in the garage. I can plug in anything that I would plug into the car. This allows me to charge my phone e or a flashlight with the 12v usb base and a cord. This little gadget is useful hooked to a battery. I'd recommend this to anyone prepping a bug out bag or just homesteading around the farm. This is a dice doohickey. I would recommend it to friends, especially off grid friends. They might need to charge the iPods, this is how. I received a discount in exchange for a honest unbiased review.
B0051SUM9U|2|2015 RAM 1500 CREW CAB OUTDOORSMAN... PAIN IN THE TAIL PIPE TO INSTALL.  BUT, just like everyone else has said, they look great!!  I have yet to see someone else with these steps.  Very unique.  Had some install issues, so I emailed the seller.  John actually was a big help, at first I was convinced they would not fit, but after a few emails he was a great help.  If you are thinking about getting them, just do it.  They look great
B00PKQGTLI|3|One of the cheaper vinyls I have used but it worked for what I needed a little harder to work with
B00FQ8AQKK|2|A little brighter on my osram stock bulb. Not that happy
B001UE64JG|5|High quality brake pads.
B00UTYYYJK|5|That fits on my car thanks
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Just what my Jeep Grand Cherokee needed!
B0039OO56Y|5|Great product, proper oil for use in Honda products requiring shaft drive lube, Honda P/N 08208-0080. I own a small engine atv/utv service center and I always use this lube in Honda vehicles/equipment requiring it. It seems no matter what vehicle I'm servicing (atv/motorcycle), 1 bottle is never enough, I'm always 1-2 ounces short and have to open 2 bottles. Not a complaint just check your service manuals for amount required so you get enough.
B001HBMYDW|5|Best plugs out there. Run them in my marine engine too.
B003IS3HV0|5|I purchased this leather conditioner at a disounted price to use and review with my honest opinion and received it just in time to use on a pair of boots that my husband had just purchased.  It is very easy to use and thick enough not to make a mess like some of the other conditioners that I have tried. It took about two hours to completely dry and made the boots feel less stiff. Did not alter the color of them at all.
B00QX94WQK|5|These were perfect for making ramps to get in and out of my building.
B00I619DOO|4|LOVE this
B001P20Y1W|3|If you are using these on factory Warn fairleads, you will have to trim the upper and lower horizontal rollers to get them to fit.  I did this with a angel grinder.  Some bumper setups like the ARB bumper uses threaded bolts to fasten the left and right rollers and fairlead to the bumper.  If you have this type, you have to be careful to not over tighten as it will pinch the rollers so they don't roll.  A better design would be to press in a hollow metal tube down the center so that you can't over tighten and they would spin freely.  The rollers don't spin as freely as metal rollers do.
B00NLNH5BA|5|Let's be clear here. We're talking about a decal. But the quality from JS Artworks was very high, the size was good (watch for this when buying car decal ovals), and the application process was really good. The sticker actually comes on an application sheet, which allows you to line it up (with the included instructions) very easily. I purchased the CR and the F decals at the same time, and both were of equal quality.
B002G39FIC|5|Does just what it claims and looks great in my '62 Lotus
B004J4GW1O|4|Good idea, really useful in what I do. Do not have to run an extension cord for one or two wire crimps on top of a large aircraft. Had to fix a small broken wire inside of the gun, no other problems so far.
B0089MBBKO|4|cover is of good quality, however, there is no antenna hole.  The style and year of mini this is advertised for has an antenna on the roof, and to use the cover, you have to allow the antenna to bend down.  Not sure of the long term effects of doing this, it may permanently damage the antenna
B0013V8GEC|5|Looks nice, easy to put on, not cheap and flimsy like other review say.
B004KKG0ZK|5|Wish it had bottom holes - other than this, looks great on the car and daughter loves it
B00F5QOFD2|1|Orded them wrong color bulb. This is the second set my wife orded me a set h11 worked for a day now the light comes on an goes off after a minute.  Read its do to the ballestecs. Next time I will just get led lights instead have had much better luck with them in the past just thought I would try these. Waste of my money.
B000C57KII|4|Good price
B007LIA8JM|5|This is a really nice steering wheel cover. Normally it bothers me not having groves to sit my fingers in when I'm driving or some covers make the steering wheel feel so fat. With it being made with memory foam it eliminates both of those problems.
B000GTTOUW|5|Perfect fit. Looks great
B00L4TF32G|5|I used 303 on a vinyl top, vinyl seats and dash that are exposed to the weather in my fj40. The results are better than expected. I'm now using it on leather seats and 303 cleaned and protected them as well.
B009LOECYG|5|as described and works well.
B007FSD3KO|3|eh.  cheaply made.
B00GDXMJU2|5|Great quality, easy application.
B0066QTI32|5|Good
B002LEEY0A|5|Very nice and a great price!
B00Y1HUMS8|5|I want to say a little about the vendor &#34;Keyless2Go&#34;....... They will go out of their way to make things right....... Highly recommended.  Thanks Neil
B0041G4KJQ|5|Works Great, good value.
B00IVA50K6|1|I received this sticker as a birthday gift on Tuesday. I put it on my car yesterday, and as of this morning, it is 100% discolored. What an absolute waste of time and money. Terrible quality. Very disappointing
B009ZNZ7VU|5|Product is good. Met expectations.  Fast shipping.
B00VKRK5QG|5|Awesome customer service. We called for help installing and we got immediate answers. My truck looks great and can clear 34&#34; tires with no rubbing now. Awesome price and extremely fast shipping! it was days early but the box was damaged which was no big deal because everything else was awesome
B00D64I8ZQ|5|So far much better than the last one I ordered.  Seems more heavy duty
B00COYZAF0|5|Aftermarket dealer told me it wouldn't make a difference in usable space between these and the factory, they lost the sale. Ordered and installed myself and my wife is able to use these as a 'step' to get in my Tacoma. Couldn't use the factory at all.
B00GNHQHG0|5|LOVE IT
B008S9CHZG|4|Bought an XL and it fits perfect, very comfortable  even with my glasses on I haven't tested it while riding yet to see how the wind affects it but if I don't do a second post it's good to go
B002CWMYQW|5|Great stuff!!
B002LHLA9K|5|Holding up in Wyoming wind
B00GBVHPV4|5|Nice
B00GSAUHB8|3|It is tedious to put it every time but when you finally do it it stays.
B00O3QB7HM|4|I ordered this mirror knowing I was going on a long road trip from Chicago to Las Vegas. Installation was a breeze. As others stated, it does take some getting used to. Definitely loke that I can see much more. It does shake/vibrate at higher speeds but overall a great product.
B000ALJ4MY|5|Not bad! I used this on a crack on my windshield from a rogue stone on the highway. The inner ring of the sticky part was just enough to surround the size of crack I had. Mine was a little deep, but I did my best to push the resin in and tap out the bubbles. There's a great youtube instruction video I followed, too; however it took longer for me to tap out the bubbles and set. After the repair, I still have a very minor streak/crack but I think it was just too deep. Everything on the surface was visually much improved. Now this won't bother me every time I drive
B00QVMZNZS|5|Worked as described.
B0088BX0IM|3|good
B0047M70TQ|1|The product was defective
B000VM27P8|3|The end on one side is too short to use near a handle bar, and the mechanism is clunky compared to other straps I own.
B00EZOUPCA|3|Not really warm white... more like bright white.
B003SYOI76|5|It was ok
B000MS5T42|4|Permits greasing difficult to reach fittings.
B004HE554Q|5|Great brakes
B00HCOIYR8|5|The lower arm control I bought for my Mercedes Benz,  both left  and right were great. They made the run  so smoothly like new . Initially, l had some doubt whether car parts purchased on line will fit well but they did!
B002ITBPI2|5|very well made
B00E1SMEMO|5|Works great no problem
B00FS9O1BC|5|looks good.  fit perfect.
B000COMX3Q|5|Piece of mind when you have a Jeep and the spare is easily accessed.
B00GYTZAEW|5|fit perfect.  works great.
B002XLL8FK|5|Perfect
B00RY9S1QK|1|No directions
B001KO4VFU|5|Second of these I've bought and will probably get another.  Great fit, great service.
B00MEYYLZA|5|Worked great
B005VKLGUW|2|Not exactly what i was looking for. I only needed the top housing. Not a blank key
B00I548SZW|5|Looks perfect, easy to install (came with all the necessary parts) and a great price.  What's not to love?
B005C5DX9I|2|During the last 8 yrs. I have had to purchase 4 of these covers and they typically last about 1 1/2 yrs. before the material starts disintegrating in the sun and starts ripping around the 4 black plastic inserts that help hold the cover on the boat.  Since they are about 1/2 of the cost of a good Sunbrella material custom cover,  I just keep buying these and throwing them away every 2 yrs.  If I kept the boat in a garage during the summer then I would expect the covers would last longer,  however with the boat being outside,  the sun takes a toll on the thin material.
B000H0KNQY|5|Uh, it's a light bulb.....
B001A3EPHU|5|Awesome! I love it.
B009LQ7YQM|5|They were exactly what I needed, for the right price.  The directions were good and they installed extremely quickly.  Saved a lot of money over the dealer and other sources.
B001W6LGGS|5|Excellent system.  I only wish the monitor was larger.
B0085YOIPG|5|So far, it's an amazing Jacket, true to size, enough ventilation for summer riding, very well made. I highly recommend it.
B0091B56TO|5|It's a wix. Better if not the exact same as OEM mopar. Don't waste your money buy this
B001O4CIHY|5|Excellent wheel chock
B000ZMWYHA|1|Fuel pump is as pictured but doesn't come with gaskets as pictured
B005UO6EWE|5|Yes it met my expectations
B0002UEN1U|5|A must for the off road kit.  This stuff can get you out of the woods or off the trail in a pinch.
B001PBPXG4|2|The only issue I have is this product didn't come with the bleeder and two hoses most all master cylinders come with. Turning out to be a pain trying to find one that will work. Wouldn't buy this product again. Because of this problem.
B005SB6S3Y|5|Works great!
B002SRZQV6|5|To me 3M products are some of the best on the market so you can't go wrong. Would recommend .
B00LO26QT2|5|great replacement item that was received early
B00199HTV4|1|So I have received 2 of these products, 1 original and 1 replacement. Upon receiving the original, I opened up the box because 1 I was excited to get my new box on my truck and 2 to inspect it due to a few tips in the box. I opened up the box and pulled the tool box out of the shipping box and looked at the front. The front lip of the top was bent in, one part was missing paint where it looked like the tool box was dropped on an edge, the top was bent in and looked like there was something heavy placed on top of the box. Contacted Amazon and ordered a replacement. Received the replacement today on 8/20/15 and opened the box to inspect the tool box, looked around the front and it was great, the back and the one end, not so much. It looked like the edge caught on something and bent it out. So I thought one flaw, that's not too bad I can bump that back in and be ok, then I seen the end.... The edge corner of the end on the lid was bent in to almost touching the tool box then upon further inspection with measuring the tool box it measures 14.5&#34; tall and 19.25&#34; wide. The measurements are suppose to be 63&#34;Lx19.25&#34;Wx19.25&#34;H. If you want to take a risk of receiving a bent up tool box, this is the product you should buy. 2 out of 2 was damaged upon receiving. Couldn't give anything less then a full star because it wouldn't let me give a quarter star.
B00IO12YZQ|1|when i recieved the bulbs and tried them out on my truck the one did not work.
B008X035N8|2|Since I've installed the struts I've had nothing but popping noises in my front end. Paid to have them readjusted and realigned. Still popping. They tell me I need new struts. THEY ARE BRAND NEW, FFS.
B000BQYK6I|5|Works. A lot cheaper than the RV store.
B0001EVUA4|5|easy installation, looks good,
B00XNN6IDE|5|Fast shipping and fits great
B000C2WF9A|1|I do not recommend this product!!!  I purchased this locking gas cap for my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500, 5.7L Hemi Crew Cab, installed it and by the next day I was getting check engine light in my truck. I put my original gas cap back on and by the next day the check engine light was gone. I went to the local auto parts store and bought me a locking gas cap, put it on and I haven't had any problems with it.
B0023W5PQW|4|Fit great and easy to install.
B0012WHBSO|5|Buy this compressor.... stop wasting $ on those $10-$20 ones.  This fills my wifes Hummer tire in 10 minutes from completely flat.  The cheep ones could take a half hour to do the same thing. Will be getting a second one for MY car.
B000QV2ENO|2|worked for 8 months then the engine light kept coming on, went and bought the Stant keyed gas cap in order to pass smog.
B00A82A3QG|5|Alternative to a remco battery, this works great and is 30 bucks cheaper.Used for a fish finder for my kayak.
B00D45DO8I|4|Fits well and not too hard to install.
B0069WB2IC|5|Awesome.
B0002FTBMG|5|Really high quality Screwdriver.  Best manufacturer - Wiha
B00KTJ3L62|2|Sub-par product.  Fits module with a little finagling, but the buttons are recessed.  Unable to effectively use transmitter with this case.
B000NWA6T0|5|FITS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL HOWEVER YOU MUST BE A CONTORSIONIST TO INSTALL IT ON A COLORADO.
B000IJBMEG|5|Beautiful
B00BITJERC|5|No Instructions or extra screws included. Guess they wanted me to use the bolts I already had. Still happy with my purchase.
B004WO9P1A|4|Very good I gave a four star because the rubber boots are junk they'll fall apart on you soon if you try to install them with the shocks you'll drive around and then you'll start hearing a clunking noise
B0014FKI1Q|5|It's a oil can, didn't leak or dissolve away so least I could do is give it 5 stars haha
B002TO86NS|5|Excellent quality
B002UC6VGS|5|Great Product and Vendor
B00AC89IYO|5|Great mirrors easy to mount and swing when hit branches 😀
B000C0UMO2|5|WORKS JUST FINE EASY TO INSTALL.
B0082GKQQW|3|A little too small for 2015 Sr5 double cab tundra
B00VO6NEZC|5|Anyone who doesn't use these to balance tires probably still communicates with grunts and clicks. Two of these went into motorcycle tires that just couldn't be balanced with wheel weights. The other 2 into tires on a trailer that will be pulled behind the motorcycle. In the end, vibration does not have a hold on these wheels.
B001GG0B5Q|5|I purchased the stickers to put on the back of my boat  to enhance the name. The instructions were very easy to follow and the installation wasn't too hard as well. I purchased them a couple months back and take my boat out at least once a week. I have it washed every time I take it out and the stickers have held up nicely.  I would recommend this product  especially to those of us who love our furry friends
B000EDUUG2|5|Compact enough to keep anywhere. I like that the broom is adjustable. The only drawback is having to press the button to adjust the broomhead.
B003OB0QEM|5|Super happy with this mod. It took about an hour to install on my 2003 WRX Wagon. I love being able to hear the turbo spooking up, the whistle is awesome and it enhanced the boost considerably. Anybody with a WRX needs this upgrade for sure!
B00JA80PEO|5|Did not tested yet , easy to install and good price
B008CH4NPQ|5|Best $ upgrade you can buy,worth it and get most led lights
B00M5CYW6O|1|after installing the fuel pump, it would not pump fuel like it is suppose to, only pumped a small stream not even enough to fill the fuel filter
B00ENOOWB2|5|Flat black hood notch, looks funky, but it works.
B00PADDLSA|3|holds less coolant than stock single row radiator
B003RACJMM|3|Ok
B007387GYK|5|It fits very well and really makes a difference in the temperature inside our little black TT.  Love it!
B00737CZNI|3|They need the ability to lock.  I added a locking mechanism which will keep the opportunity thief out.  Also rain covers would be nice.  Otherwise, they look good on the bike and function as advertised.
B00PJZZ8IU|5|Good on the delivery  time and installed the mirrors looks great! !
B004C24HJ2|5|when used with intake and swept pipes. awesome performance and sound
B00BYNJAVW|5|Definitely has made a difference.
B009DJVZEY|5|Arrived fast not damaged. great buy
B00ML7IELC|5|Very bright. Easy plug and play.
B00480J4M8|4|Great product!
B007JSGR9Y|5|It is a cheap and very useful reader.
B000F7VKD4|5|Works very well
B00068AJPM|5|Supershine!!!!
B00O2BZC92|5|I actually have several window clings on my car. This one is one of those super cool ones where only other nerds will know what it means.  When I put it on my car I did NOT include the portion which says &#34;choose wisely&#34;. It looks great even after several car washes and heavy rains.
B00062YUUS|5|Fast service.<br />Great price.
B0080CDDO0|5|Excellent product
B00ITJSMKE|5|This bandage is awesome !
B00HVON6A4|5|It's a genuine Honda part. It should meet my expectations.
B0065UNPS8|5|very good
B00186DUNY|2|Ripped a little during installation. Paid for what I got
B003904GHG|5|great product !
B006YVTL04|5|Just exactly what I wanted, OEM product.
B00555PBJA|5|awesome
B00Q1F6LC4|5|everything is fine-fits perfect,looks like original.thanks to seller.
B000H2DLK2|5|Put these in my new to me 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. These were so much brighter than the ones that come with it, that may have been dim with age, that it increased the effective range by quite a bit
B010MRDDC2|5|These brackets work fantastic, they grip the bar tightly, I have been off-road a lot after I installed a 32&#34; light bar- NO Slippage! Check photo for mounting  angle-
B00M5F8C26|5|works as advertised
B000E7YP7I|5|Excellent.<br />Great !<br />Would buy it again and I think I will.
B001HBWMI4|1|poorly made not worth it.
B0053O9EUA|5|Holy cow I was impressed. Really quieted the &#34;clunk&#34; of the tranny on my 2013 Road King. Neutral is easy to find and shifting along with a properly adjusted clutch works wonders. I would suggest this product to anyone!
B00BFXJGAQ|5|Worked perfect on my 04 Yamaha FZ6. It took me literally 5 minutes to install. I took off the inside upper fairing and located the stock relay, unplugged and plugged the new relay in. Pretty straight forward!
B004AQZA3W|1|Junk.Riser bad casting,
B003S5XCDQ|5|works great
B00MWNZ1E8|1|Does not fit a 2002 Bmw 325ci.  Return policy Is 2 days after date of purchase.  Buyer beware!!!!!
B00YMSUOIE|5|Easy install, Noticeably changed the Engine sound and increased acceleration. There's a deep throaty noise under heavy acceleration, and at about 2k RPM you get that nice whistle suction sound that you'd expect from a CAI. Love It.
B00CK9ADOM|5|So glad I didn't go with another plate when this one stayed out of stock foreverrrrr.  It looks so cute on the back of my truck and is me to a tee.  If this is out of stock, add it to your wish list and check back at random times.  I waited for months; this was literally my white unicorn.  I got so desperate that I would check in the morning -out of stock- but one night I couldn't sleep at 2 am and there were 14 in stock.  By sunrise, they were gone!  Good luck!!
B009T4J4Y6|5|Awesome grips! Keeps hands warm on cold rides at night!
B00IZAL9AW|5|As always, great quality from Joe Rocket.
B007JSGR9Y|5|This is an amazing little device. Worked like a champ on my Subaru Outback 2005. Just plug it right in while your key is in the start position and it'll read your codes right then and there. I bought this in lieu of my mechanic trying to charge me $120 for a simple diagnostic which took me less than a few minutes to do myself. There is no reason any average joe shouldn't have one of these OBD-II code readers in their garage.<br /><br />MaxiScan MS309 does not run on batteries and is very simple to use with a quick skim through the directions booklet. I'm very satisfied with the reader and would highly recommend it for anyone having lights come on in their dashboard.
B000VX99TE|4|Been raining all week and no water in the jeep.  Needed some bungys to hold it down and didn't come with the bag.
B005K97RRA|5|works what else can I say !
B002R1094M|4|Right on target
B003B1W71U|3|This is not compatible with my 02 Tacoma Pre-runner 4 door.  After getting ready to put them on I called Monroe about the bearing plate and they told me not to install them that they are not rated for the weight of the crew cab Tacoma.<br /><br />Go to their website and plug your vehicle info in prior to buying and make sure they are listed as an option for your specific year, make, model, and body style.
B000FQ0BRQ|5|Kind of a pain to install but works great great fit and no more noise!!!
B0002KKIXC|5|Good stuff. It removed many dog &#34;pee&#34; stains on our beige carpet. Strong smell!!!
B009DJKJSW|3|Good deal
B0027EUPFC|5|Works quieter and better than the actual pump that came with the pool. Arrived before expected, which was welcome, since ours was not working at all.
B00DZUEOG8|5|They fit nice on my 97 Explorer. Really cleans up the stance. I've checked the torque settings on them multiple times and they were always good.
B001P0WRO6|5|Easy to install and set-up
B005L13SJ8|4|The muffler fit well and sounds great. I gave it only four stars due to a lack of good instructions.. Would buy again. I did not have to re-jet, just a air fuel adjustment
B0042A059K|5|Work great, Just what I needed
B000B7RCJE|5|just as described
B000GU3KEC|5|My husband loves it. Uses it every day
B000C9WJ3A|5|Great product! Fits perfect in my 2007 Civic coupe!
B008VQ0RSU|5|Works great
B00A726AEQ|5|👍🏻
B00CP6J6YI|5|So far so good
B00O06V3QK|5|Nice tight fit.  I ordered two after my ball mount got stuck after just one day in place.  The receiver is open on both ends and has taken a beating after two Vermont winters.  These fit on both ends.  I will definitely need something to pop them off when needed but I'd rather have that then a loose fit and end up having it fall off after a couple of days!
B005FNKSMW|5|My kids love the new battery.
B004HO71WU|5|Excelent
B007I5B6PS|5|Coupled with a new drive shaft and no more vibration.
B000CCFFL0|5|It is good
B000GZEK00|5|Amazing price aND it fit perfectly
B00NK29SNU|5|Works great.  Would buy again.
B004LWWNLC|5|These make it very easy to hook up the trickle charger and not have the hassle of screwing and unscrewing caps or trying to get to a hard to reach battery.
B0044FPNIG|5|Very Nice
B0067P6VO6|5|Extremely happy with this slip on.  Eazy to follow instructions for installation. Sounds and looks great.  Highly recommend.
B00BZSE5CK|5|Save yourself some money on all the flashy stuff, support your love for the Jeep brand by buying this basic Hitch Cover.
B001C99TPK|5|I bought this for my 2004 XC 90 with the T6. Everything fit well. The idler and tensioner bearings are both INA which is what the OEM part were. Only time will tell if they will hold up an last as they should. If they fail prematurely for any reason I will update this review.  For now though there is no reason at all to believe that they will not last and work just as the OEM Volvo parts did but at a much better price.
B0028JPECA|5|Very Nice
B00P2D4C36|4|Longer lasting than the store bought ones I used to get, and priced better, so will continue to buy these as my Prius V goes though 1-2 bulbs nearly every month. I use them almost 99% of the time on the road with my long work commute.
B00L3KDUD0|5|I seriously hate cleaning the wheels on my car, but these things made the process much quicker and more effective.<br /><br />The long fat one is excellent for getting inside the barrel of the wheel, too.
B00HXHTAUO|4|Great product!!
B0117EETEK|5|perfect for home auto repair!
B004G44RKK|5|Semper Fi - I put the same one on my father's casket.  He'll have no problem reporting to St. Peter.
B00SCDPB2O|5|I just installed this on a buddies 13 F150. I have a lift in my garage and this kit took me about 11hours to install. I had no rusted parts as truck only had 7500 miles on it so it will take longer if you are working on a rusty truck. The instructions were very good. Some of the bolt and wrench sizes were wrong and they never say when to plug the power steering assist back in so I did it at the end and they never say when to tighten to lower control arm bolts so I did it on the lift which proved to be a mistake. It bound up the suspension so it didn't settle when I put it on the ground leading me to believe they sent me.the wrong steering nuckles. I contacted Rough Country via Facebook on a Saturday at 9pm and got an instant response and answers that solved my issues. Very impressive! The ride afterwards was great. There was no missing hardware or parts which was unexpected for a kit of this size. Nice job Rough Country!
B009XFDYNS|4|So far so  good
B00199N5LW|5|works great. good price
B008971VOK|5|These plates are really nice and compliment my TC. Anyone that owns a TC should get these!
B0027AGS52|5|Product was delivered quickly, and looks to be a much better product than the original ACDelco rotos that came on the car.
B00D39M5LM|5|DEFINATELY ADDS CHARACTER TO OUR XTERRA. THANKS
B004MBS7CQ|2|Rusted really quickly.
B007IZX3IG|5|Worked perfect
B00QMI3CZ4|3|The forged ends are not curved so they tend to slip this is NOT a good thing they will work but the screw part gets in the way in my case.
B007U6733Y|5|Better than original quality.  Easy install with a T-9 torx driver.
B00B1ENJ7K|3|I say 7 out of ten work. the leads seem to be to soft when pulling bulb out  the leads put back and bend
B0061SKB2W|5|Very simple item that does double duty. It acts as a grabber and when purchased with the side pockets it is a divider that keeps things from sliding all around.
B00EANSS52|5|I was looking all over for a dual master cylinder that would fit in my '62 Lotus and this worked great!
B00G4S0PQ6|5|Perfect Match....
B00WV5NA6I|1|It looked good for a year.  The install was tedious and after a year the glue gave out and it looked cheap and was falling apart...there are better products out there than this.
B000JFHNTM|5|Saved me hours of work by clearly outlining the area and source of the oil leak in my older Harley Davidson
B00QRHDIPY|4|Not sure if its doing anything but I keep it on travel trailer during non use time so I hope that keeps up the charge.
B0075KB3W2|5|I put this on the inside of my window to preserve it better and it looks really nice! It's a great price for how big it is and the quality. The vinyl is as nice as the product description says!
B00D3298A0|5|Fits great in my 2007 pontiac torrent
B000WBQ4U2|5|Awesome tool. Crimps beautifully.
B002UCACJK|5|I broke ours within one week of owning a gently used 5th wheel.  Easy to install by my husband and it works great.
B00EW1ALXO|5|perfect although we haven't given it to her yet
B000EBKG9A|5|Sticks well.  But if you put in on a door, I would suggest you have someone helping you because it sticks to itself a lot.
B004SFKJIQ|2|IT DOESN'T HAVE MOUNTING HARDWARE, NOR IS THERE ANYTHING AVAILABLE.  KIND OF USELESS FOR A BOAT OR RV.  NO IDEA WHERE ELSE YOU WOULD WANT ONE.....
B00GWFOPTO|5|Works good
B0030GAUEW|5|High quality. Perfect fit.
B000XBJ5UM|5|Fit just like the OEM, better quality, better price
B009I6C0B4|1|Immediately started rusting!
B004LF5C5S|5|Installed easily. Instructions and pictures could have been a little better.

B0045WBVUM|5|Best dam thing I bought for my motorcycle!!
B00JHEG7UC|3|I bought two kits for my integra and Corolla, the kit was easy to install and the lights are bright. However my kit has a problem where the passenger headlight doesn't always turn on, but it turns on after turning the headlights on and off several times. Overall, I'm satisfied.
B0082365AQ|4|Works great and price is right! I use this to transport my sit on top kayak when im alone. I gave 4 stars because of heavy rubber smell. Although, the smell does seem to be getting less and hope that it will eventually all be gone.
B003V1BHX4|5|Awesome service will definitely order again
B001A3H7UC|5|Love these gloves
B00PDCZLZ4|5|If you are looking for a basic scan tool to read diagnostic codes and reset the &#34;Check Engine&#34; light, this is a great choice.  Mechanics would likely want a more sophisticated unit with more features, but this scan tool works well for getting an idea of what might be going on with your vehicle before taking it to a mechanic.
B000AA8G5G|3|Does what it's supposed to do, but it's very difficult to see the bubble in din light.
B005N53CG6|5|Comfy soft.
B001AHI1U8|5|Worked fine, I hope the suction cups last.
B000BV01CK|5|Works great to warm up the trailer to take baths.<br />Will run you out of a 7x16 trailer on high when 30 deg outside<br />Uses very little propane<br />Make sure you calculate the size you need there is no thermostat just low, med, High<br />  When temp is above 50 outside I have to open the vent a lot to regulate the heat.<br />  Also keep in mind this is Infrared so it take 10-15 minute before it starts feel warm.
B000O5K7MC|5|worked great
B00496ILZC|4|Product as described
B00540GOMY|5|Just bought my 2012 Prius 2 and had to get a cargo net for college groceries. This cargo net is sturdy and took less than a minute to install. Awesome :)!
B0013LS8X6|5|Great bug guard, simple install, nice quality.
B00ISLQWVY|5|Good replacement for old style halogen cans
B001JT1CEE|5|Exactly as expected
B00IZGY43U|5|very good battery worked like a charm
B007KPERVG|2|Side corner light did not fit the opening (too large). the rest of the system worked as it should.
9539751047|5|Nice high quality sticker.  Shows no signs of fading yet!
B0012TZ1RU|5|I bought this to fix a steering wheel squeak in my BMW E36.  It's a common problem that surfaces with these models and the squeak (or sometimes crunch) comes from a joint that is just outside the firewall in the engine compartment.  I sprayed the chain wax through two connected flexible straws and Voila, the squeak and crunch went away.  I read that using chain wax will keep the joint lubricated longer and so far so good.  My garage did smell like wax for about a day but the smell did go away.
B000UZPPKA|5|Worked great
B00FOWSPPG|4|Nice material, keeps your head cool.
B000IYFXQY|5|Easy to install and factory fit - I recommend it - used to replace worn lift supports on the Hood of my 04 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B00407WNE0|5|Installed in just a few minutes with minimal effort.  It just snaps into place, the screw heads are decorative only.  The door itself is pretty solid and feels well made.
B0002GXOPK|5|Nice lights, really light up the road and more importantly since i live in eastern NC with a huge deer population 15'-20' of roadside.
B002UD0GIG|3|Doesn't work for sunglasses! I had a small scratch on a pair of expensive Oakley sunglasses. This product had no effect on the scratch and only proved to remove some sort of coating from the lens. So, I went from a small scratch to a totally ruined lens.<br /><br />I'm only giving three stars (not lower) because the product may work great for other stuff. I only purchased it for use with sunglasses.
B00N2D206E|5|this has been great why teaching my kids to drive.  People give them the space they need
B00638AAVM|5|Good emblems. Put them on my Pontiac G8. Seem to be good quality too.
B00V4049K2|5|I took a chance and purchased 2 of these solely based on the many positive reviews of this product. I owned an EV Spark and a Lexus SUV. The EV Spark always has an odd odor, which is probably coming from the fake leather on the chairs. This product did help reduce the odor, and each time i enter the car, the smell isn't so intense that it makes me nauseated anymore. However, it works wonders on my Lexus SUV. There's literally no odor of any kind in that car. To be fair, I keep the Lexus immaculately clean-- so this product just simply pushed its cleanliness over the edge. I would probably purchase it again if it actually lasts 365 days as promised.<br /><br />Note: when I tried to extend the ties to expand it to the point where I can put it over the head rest, one of the knot came loose. Took me a bit to copy the original knot. So just be careful when putting it on, or you may waste some time tying the knot back together like me.

B00PJGVW8E|5|Great looking jacket. Fits as expected. Sleeves are nice and long and love the layering ability.
B0051C5ZFM|1|What I received is not as big like how the one in the picture is - I would say it's about half in depth. The picture shows a basketball in the net to show how big it is - the product I received would not look the same if I put a basketball inside because it's not that deep!<br />Something this size is pointless; especially for me.
B00QOJ027C|5|Very nice!! Exactly what I was expecting. Delivered fast too.
B00AKX813U|5|Good, cheap, fast - sometimes you can get all three!  I used these to replace melted-out bulb sockets about 6 or 8 weeks ago, and they are still working perfectly.
B0002H335A|5|VERY WELL MADE AND HEAVY DUTY. A TWO PACK IS THE BEST WAY TO GO.
B000E4N1YY|2|It fits but it is plastic not metal like factory and rubber seal did not stay around the part!

B00SZK1420|3|They're brighter than the OEM bulbs in the fog lights on a 2013 Tahoe Z71 but don't show up any better on the road.  The rectangular fog lights on this vehicle aren't really good for much anyhow so I don't believe it's the bulbs fault.
B005K01GSA|5|Fits perfectly
B005NXMFW0|5|Keeps the cent arm rest cooler with the top off. No more scalded arm!
B00H58CX2S|5|I just installed this grille on my 04 impala literally after I got off work about 10-15 minutes if I had all the tools I needed but gotta say it looks a lot better than the original no problems with drilling the holes and I don't know where or how it's getting a low review no problems here, I'd recommend this grille to anybody

B00D9BFR8M|3|Its ok
B008OYAOSW|5|Much better than the round footpegs.  They are a little loose in the original fittings, but I never fold them up,so it really does not matter.
B0058P52GO|5|Love it wish it would open MTAC
B000BO9J52|5|Works great
B00JIEX722|5|I installed these bulbs today in my 2007 Mazda Speed 6. I checked them out at night and light rain where the stock bulbs would be inadequate, with these installed I was able to back up safely.  Each cars back up light design can effect how much light is cast backwards because of the reflector design. These lamps are short, only one inch long tip to tip. The stock lamp is 1 3/8 inch tip to tip.  The light is an excellent color--no blue hue. They do the job at a modest price and so are recommended.  Tip: If one or both do not light up, do not give up. I had one that did not light at first try. Make sure the wire contacts on the bulb are straight and try again, even reversing by 180 and try again. Happened with one of mine. I had to insert about 4 times before it lit.  I don't think you can go wrong with the JMD ASTAR 5730 SMD LED bulbs.
B00MY414AA|5|Great pads
B000G369T2|4|One problem was both bottom corners were bent during shipping and paint had to be touched up.  However still functions fine.
B00MOKN5Z6|5|Great deal and pruduct👍🏼
B00BTLEIIY|5|Really made the interior look new again.
B00XB3X4UG|5|So easy to install, super bright and add some great character! Awesome product for great price!
B0016KFW06|4|My biggest complaint is that it hangs pretty low underneath the bumper. It takes away a good five inches of ground clearance away from the back of the car. You never know when you're going to drive up or down something too steep and scrape it against road. My only hope is that if that were to happen it would not bend and ruin the hitch or the frame itself. Also, the installation took a lot longer than they suggested and you need two people but only briefly to hold the hitch up.
B000KSTFJO|5|Very happy with these guns. work perfectly nice consistent smooth pattern, can fine tune your paint/air ratio like a gun three times this price. the only thing about these I would change is the cup lids, a screw on lid would make these a A+ set of guns for sure. the snap on lids are very tight and you need to hold the cup with one hand and push down hard on the lids. if u hold the gun and try to push the lid on you run the risk of damaging the cup to gun fitting. and a leak will form.
B001P2HP46|5|just right size for 2004 mercury grand marquis, with nice deep cup holders and room to organize a lot inside
B0016KA8AK|4|Too low to the ground. I would have gotten the class 1 hitch had I known.  I had to get a 7&#34; drop and turn it upside down to keep my trailer from scraping.  Good quality hitch, looks good, not too bad to install, but not good on a Toyota Sienna. One thing they tell you in the instructions is to cut out a huge hunk of the plastic cover under the cargo are and throw it away. Toyota engineers put that there for a reason. I could see a lot of ice, snow and road salt getting packed in there and rotting my car and hitch. I managed to find a way to only cut out the slot for the mounting bracket and leave the plastic panel pretty much in tact. That, however, made installation quite a bit more difficult. I also did not have to drop the exhaust with some creative maneuvering. Again more difficult. The hitch was about 3 hours to install. 2011 Toyota Sienna Limited AWD
B00KWGAHS2|5|Great buy!
B008Y3RUNK|4|Appears to be identical. Am saving for a spare. Standard delivery came early too.
B00C5WQ4H4|1|This is the worst relay harness I ever bought.  I don't recommend it to anyone.  Most of the time when I try to turn on my lights, they flash and then turn off right away.  Then I need to try to turn my lights off and back on again many times before maybe one of the lights finally turns on.  I tried different ballasts and bulbs but do not make a difference so I know the issue is the relay harness.  My stock headlight plugs work better than these.  Even the cheap $10 relay harness that I purchased before work better than this one.  I made the decision to buy this harness because I thought it would be better than the cheap ones since it was $30 and previous reviews said that it was good.  But after receiving it, it is totally not worth it for several reasons:  It is short, I had to stretch it with an extension to be able to barely reach the opposite side of the engine bay of the battery in my mini van which the distance isn't really that long.  It only has a single power cable and single 25 amp fuse that powers the whole harness.  What is the purpose of having 2 relays if there is only one power cable and fuse going to both of them?  So this is not an independent system for each headlight (which I thought it would be from an answer to a question that I asked) and if the fuse blows, both of your headlights will go out.  There is only one cable that plugs into your existing headlight socket that acts as a switch to activate the harness when you turn on your headlights, so just one of your headlight sockets tells both relays when to turn on and your other headlight socket is just left hanging open for moisture or anything else to get into.
B004E6EYD0|5|LOVE this in the back of my jeep!!!
B00G4L23PY|1|I am expecting a brighter output but it failed me.
B0055B0AV8|5|Work great.
B0024GIWDK|5|Nice helmet for the price.  Use it every day
B002P8T3ZS|5|So much cheaper buying this on Amazon.  Took mechanic just a few minutes to put it on.  The mirror works  perfectly.  Not having it painted.  Just put in the make, model, and year of your car and you'll get the correct mirror-one that fits your car.
B00B4HU7WO|1|Put the frame on bike went for a ride and when stopped the BEER part of the frame was gone cheaply made....save your money
B003S1RQ2S|5|Good for several trips running a GPS  on the kayak
B00KVO4RZY|5|Came fast. Looks just like the picture. Easy to put my bike on. Now there are no marks on my painted floor. And, I toss it in my bike bag when I ride so I always have a flat spot for my stand. Love it and it is easy to use. What more can you ask for.
B0009PSA4O|5|Love this mirror. Clams on well and does not move. Great replacement mirror for our 1985 Mastercraft stars and stripes.
B00G620ZVU|5|These little guys are awesome! I installed them on my 01 TJ. They mount perfectly to the stock front bumper; there are already holes in the bumper toward each end that I used. They look good mounted, too. Definitely improved the look of my Jeep.<br /><br />And, these things are bright as heck. They throw a good shine a fairly long ways. I'm pretty sure that they aren't legal for on road 'driving/fog light' use, but if there aren't any other cars ahead of you, they beat the high beams. They are also great for off roading; they've already more than paid for themselves by illuminating a few trail hazards that I may not have been able to see without them.
B003ZOGY1C|5|This fit our 2008 Jayco Seneca 35 HD like a glove. It has a 430 Chevy cab. We first ordered the 2509 but it had cut outs for the mirror post which we have but the wrap stayed above them so we did not need the cutouts. Easy return and got the 10 which worked very well. It could use more magnets but will add if a problem occurs where we really have to as with wind since the end a of our garage is open. The cover is a good grade of vinyl material and thick enough to last. We had to get since the leather seats were fading although in the shade. Highly recommend.
B00D3QUIUA|3|Unlike Mann filters, this is firm and fairly rigid which should make it easier to install.
B00FW1JY0Y|3|WATCH VIDEOS ONLINE BEFORE INSTALLING or it might cost you $40. Seriously.  I'm not that big of an idiot. I watched a video about how to change the map and dome lights on YouTube to make sure I was doing everything properly. Peachy. I swapped out the map and dome lights, then moved onto the door lights. By that time, I figured I was a pro, and didn't look up how to swap out the door lights. Yet it was no problem; the light covers came off and the new lights went in just fine.  Then came the trunk. It's a different situation. You have to put your finger in a cutout and push in a plastic snap latch on the right and pull the whole thing out (cable still attached), and then BE SURE you detach the grey plug from the clear plastic lightbulb housing, and THEN pull the bulb out. Otherwise you may short the microswitch in the trunk latch, like I did. I pulled the light bulb out without detaching it from the plug, and heard a little pop and the bulb flickered and came back on. So I pressed on and put the LED bulb in. Everything seemed fine, but the trunk ajar indicator on the dashboard wouldn't turn off after. I put my phone while recording video in the trunk and closed the lid and, sure enough, the trunk light never turned off. Somehow I managed to short circuit it. I did some reading online and it's a fairly easy thing to do if you do not follow the correct instructions. Apparently it's a $40 part to replace. Not the end of the world, but this could have been solved if the seller included a little slip of paper that warns you about the trunk bulb.  (I have a 2015 2 door accord, so YMMV with these instructions)  Otherwise, the product is mostly okay. The bulbs are a lot larger than the factory bulbs, and the LED on the tip of the bulb is very close to the plastic of the dome light, so there's a noticeable bright dot rather than being evenly illuminated, so that's -1 star.  The fact that it doesn't come with instructions is disappointing, but whatever. Sure, you can blame Honda for how easy it is to short out the trunk light, but at the end of the day, I really wish the seller could have opened Microsoft Word and added one extra little warning on the label they print on the bag and save us some headache. For that alone, and because I'm still a little salty, I'm taking off a few stars.  UPDATE: The dealership replaced the part under warranty, so all is well. I'll bump it up a star now that I'm not fueled by frustration, but I cannot give it more than 3 stars considering that the backup lights aren't as bright as the original.
B000C01SL8|5|Combined these with a set of full set akebono pads and a rear pair of centric rotors (120.40057) and they're awesome. No noise, no dust, and my braking is way smoother than before. They replaced rotors with only 10,000 or so miles and the difference is night and day. The painted hub is also great to keep the rotor rust free and looking great<br /><br />My car is a 2008 Honda Civic Si 4dr if anyone has questions on the fit.
B00MB0D9G4|4|Perfect match for my interior. Decent product for the price
B00T6GJ5IW|5|He loves them
B00ED81S0Q|5|Got the decal in the right amount of time and item looked just like what I got! Wash my car and it looks great. Easy applications and easy instructions.
B0049O4SYC|5|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. A definite difference in stopping power from the semi metallic pads. I read they tear up the rotors quicker, so only time will tell.
B008YIFER4|4|The item was as described and arrived in a timely fashion,
B0032DBR0O|5|Great product and exactly as described.
B00GQO5C9S|4|These are pretty good chocks.  Back in Sept 2014 I paid $9.90 for two.  I clicked on buy it again and the price came up $8.80...but this time I only got one and was surprised.  My fault I didn't read or notice the change.  Unfortunately, my 7,000 pound trailer can destroy them.  I destroyed one when I pulled away not knowing they weren't removed.  I felt some resistance but the Cummins in my 3500 dually didn't hesitate much.  Luckily the other one squirted out to the side as I pulled away at a strong angle on blacktop.  Good news is I only needed one.  Still nearly 100% increase in price for these.  Hmmm...definitely no inflation here.
B0007M1ZGE|5|This is mounted on our travel trailer and we are very pleased. Looks good, not obtrusive and easy to install.
B009XIV2AM|5|Looks great! Super easy to install. Just had to unscrew the boring see-through stock windshield and screw this bad boy in and was done. I recommend the dark smoke as it added a really mean look to the front of my bike. My 2013 Ninja has the matte black around the headlights so this windshield definitely completes the look.
B00UNPAR50|5|Used it once so far and the gage performed very well.  Caution, you must have knowledge of ac systems to use this. Not for someone just starting (or that cannot call someone for help).
B00Q3CPPW2|1|I submitted the make answer model of my car and the seat covers still didn't fit. The product was torn when I opened the package, I was so disappointed I just threw it away
B000IETT5K|5|perfect fit, looks good, and protects the hood.
B00CSWEJZU|2|It left spots on vehicle when trying to dry it.
B00MG687JW|5|This jump starter-phonecharger-light is awsome!!! It's a must have if you drive a lot or are a boater. Doesn't take up much room and very easy to use. I have already used it and it works perfect! Also, Amazon is awsome too!
B0118S90IU|5|Had Thanks it looks good on me and also came right on time
B002S9UVKU|5|warm ehen it hits 45 or so
B0009IQXFO|5|This product works great on our cars and Rv. Have tried the just like products and they are not the same.
B00N18LXJ0|2|It does deflect glare and it does stay in place very well.  The problem I have is that the view through the lens is a bit distorted and causes eye fatigue if used for extended periods.
B00JXI9Q78|5|They look good. I've had them installed for a month. No issues.
B000C55MQK|5|Best shocks ever purchased.This is my 3rd set installed on my van and would recommend.
B007X6OEYW|5|Makes washing my 4x4 much easier
B000A8MYNI|5|What can I say, replaced my Onan 5kw genset spark plug. Better quality than original, fit like an OEM part, highly recommend. Cheaper too
B00KTJ8K54|5|So easy to program instead of going to the dealer.thanks,amazon
B00KQZY794|5|The product arrived on time ans seems to be working well. I have a tire shop and fix flats on a daily basis
B00OIQ3ZYU|1|The wires on the magneto were pinched and it did not work.
B00B51XMGW|4|It fit and looked great but I was expecting stock mounting studs not screws and screw holes
B0035YGLZG|5|I bought this in May last year. So far so good. It is constantly in use, permanently attached to my cyclone cart. I plug any portable or stationary tool to it and it does what it supposed to do which is start the vac when you start the tool. You can also turn on the vac by itself with the 'on' switch, (auto, off, on) so you don't have to reach down to the vacuum switch. The third socket is always on. Serves as a extension cord socket for a random tool you might use in the project. I bought a second iVac for another cyclone cart I just built.
B003YJJHI0|5|Purchased for camping to avoid high pressure from campground water.  It is easy to install and has worked very well.
B0020MHLTY|1|Radiator was put together wrong. The side pieces were on the wrong sides.
B00PXTUN5A|5|It's great
B00BHH1QT4|5|Works as expected
B00AQ48SAY|5|Worked perfectly on my Dodge ram  1500 stopped the squeaky Noise I had coming from my driver side
B0018Y44Z4|5|works great covering my 08JK when I have my trektopNX off for the summer and stored in the garage. If your have aftermarket sliders you may have issues with the bottom straps. I was able to extend them all the way open, and then wrap them under, but keep that in mind.
B000C9E09Q|5|Perfect fit
B000EDOT82|4|Fit perfectly on my little stove in my Rv. I will be buying more.
B00BTT2LEY|5|It certainly met my expectations!
B005G5EAGE|5|Good
B00GUBZJC2|5|OEM GM part....fit perfect!
B001449MH8|5|Good quality and got what I needed
B004I132DO|1|Do u have these lights whit the housing black?? The one I bought came with the housing red so it doesn't match the one on my car
B002EC570A|5|This belt stopped squeaks on my Toyota Yaris that other belts did not.
B00E1JNTP4|5|Perfect fit and function
B000CDADFM|1|despite the product info, the wiper was the wrong size for the rear window.
B00GH0A65G|5|soft
B000I66JEM|5|Nice product. Bought this for my new truck in Costa Rica. Metric size is larger. Won't fit must return
B00904WS8E|4|not bad for the price, good for summer temps
B003G6AORE|5|They're ok. Not as bright as I expected.
B00G0P0I60|5|I used this for a replacement on my 2010 Toyota Tundra, the original had dried out and crumbled apart from the sun.
B000C9DCHW|5|Worked as indicated
B003XGYDE2|3|Very noisy, working all right...
B007A8OOK2|3|While a master link clip was included... this chain itself appears to have been made for use only for rivet as the link will not compress enough for the master clip to work without removing the o-rings. Chain itself is very high quality feeling.
B00A0DL3NU|5|Great quality filters at a fair price
B006PI0KK6|5|Love them!! I read reviews before settling on these. They fit perfectly in my 2012 Jeep Liberty Latitude Edition that I just purchased. I was concerned about parts of the floor not being covered when I saw the shape of them, but I am happy to report that they fit like a glove in all the cut outs of the floor. The clip holes matched up perfectly for the best fit as well. They look sharp with the tread details and compliment the vehicle interior which is dark slate gray. Have already recommended them to a friend who just purchased a 2011 Liberty. Thanks Mopar....great quality!
B005F9IJWM|5|Looks great
B005VLD08W|5|nice .. works fine.
B009OBVS2K|5|This stuff is GRATE I Love it, I ordered 2-More after I used it. I used it on my car then the 18 ft Garage Door.very good cleaner. It took the water makes off with very little rubbing.
B000C1MWA8|4|as advertised good part
B000C9GYTA|5|As described
B001RLQIIE|1|Got a four pack of spark plugs pulled my last one out to use and it wasn't the right one it was a ngk 5686
B00VXGAO06|4|Great mirror for the price
B005GSFX3A|1|they do not fit in a pontoon boat table and only in some of the cup holders make sure it fits before you buy it
B00TUNSOMO|4|I use this on a 2002 Ford Ranger, after cleaning it thoroughly. This truck spends a lot of time near the ocean and usually has plenty of salt and sand debris.  Its pretty easy to use, just spray on and use some elbow grease.<br />My only complaint is the spray bottle, I would prefer a continuous spray that was easier to aim and hit specific parts, but that's just my personal preference.
B000MT7OSK|2|these are VERY small.  I'm a woman with a pretty ordinarily sized face (I think) and I had to return these because they were tiny.
B00I3KLZTE|3|Only good on small pits.
B0012UCJTM|4|Stopped the leak, what could be better:)
B004STBY0E|1|don't wast your time...
B00S6GZPLY|5|I bought two key rings but I lost screws on each key chain. How do I get 2 more screws? It is mind boggling that CAN AM designed a great bike but did not leave a hole on the key. Paying $35 each after you spend $25,000+ for a key chain is not my idea of keeping the customer happy.
B00TP0I210|5|Fit perfect A++
B005C1Y9D6|5|Exactly as advertised. Suggest inclusion of an installation sheet describing how diodes must be polarized when installing.<br />Prompt response to my inquiry. Remarkable change in interior lighting scheme.
B0012PQX3U|5|Works just fine, I am happy to get my A/C fixed.
B004UQR1UM|3|Deosn't hold up well.  Outer bristles spread very easily and so don't go in lug hole well.  But it works.
B00DEJUYBE|5|great product and looks good.
B009A6W3UU|5|Great quality sweatshirt with nice attention to detail.  Runs slightly large based on comparison with Carhartt sweatshirts.
B005ADVVVY|4|It's really nice to be able to open the driver side door with the key fob again!
B008KZKFNY|5|EXACT FOR SONATA 2013, NOT NEED TO ADD ANY HOLDER. PRICE IS 50% OF DEALERS/
B00KTITKN6|5|Part worked great
B000766RZ4|4|Good screen, Really wanted a bug screen inside the hood covering the radiator
B00UB71N0I|4|Item light weight
B000CPCRFO|5|So happy i found this for such a great price.  Love this product!
B00GSHBAX0|5|Great for holding things in place
B009DJRUNY|4|Perfect fit
B00FH3YB5K|5|no words to describe how much this has helped keep my purse in a place for organization.  my purse is next to me its not on the floor being kicked around or stepped on.  I'm not worried about losing the contents with it on the floor.
B00V9SEEYK|5|Loved it, big fan of this game even if it lost its shine, use ot to put my keys and all my friends loe it kinda jingley if you ride in the car with them but awesome nontheless
B007YJUNW0|1|The part shorted out and over heated my battery as soon as i installed it so the part was no good and now my batterys fried as well.
B004PKSUGC|5|The part got here in 2 days and everything is great!! Put it right on my beautiful 04 mustang and happily driving again!!! If you need an alternator this is the one!
B009OBVS2K|1|Didn't clear the water spots at all, old fashioned bar of soap and water worked better.
B006JRDRI0|5|Product fit perfectly , looks good , zero hesitation recommending these.
B0031GN52U|5|Perfect Fit.  Installed on 2007 Hummer H3. Had to fight for 4 hours to remove the OEM one.
B00LADO6H4|5|Works awesome will be buying more stuff fast shipping
B009TM60SQ|5|Have not installed as it is a travel spare.
B00ARJRDGI|5|Seems to do what it's supposed to. Decent price, but ultimately will swap back to oem for piece of mind.
B00TUNSV2W|5|One of my family's boats had accumulated a bunch of dirt and mold from sitting outside for a long time. This cleaner cut RIGHT through the dirty, it was amazing to see how quickly and easily it cut through the grime. It literally looked like it was brand new. My father-in-law who has owned several boats and used different cleaners said he would buy this spray on his own. It cleaned the inside well as well, consoles and all surfaces looked amazing. Hands did not smell like we were cleaning with chemicals, and it didn't feel the same as some harsh chemicals, even without gloves. We did not even spend an hour cleaning the boat-this stuff is awesome!
B004PHDLQY|5|Hard to get emotional or weepy eyed over contact cleaner.  As a hobbiest who occasionally fixes old tube-era radio equipment, this is the perfect stuff for volume controls, wafer switches and such.
B00RUZPRMY|5|My gf has an 03 Dodge Neon SE that was starting to drag a** when we had people in the back. After looking around this was the best deal I could find. After having them installed I can honestly say that I am impressed. These struts are every bit a good as Monros (don't think that's spelled right) at about half the price!
B00KRB1X1W|5|Nice ventilation. Everything works well. Its really comfortable. The helmet is fine but there is two plastic covers; one in the chin and the other one goes in the nose area; in my case they came loose but you can put it back on. The helmet is a little big but I think is because you can install a Bluetooth device. Other than that I really like the helmet
B001N2O3PM|5|both of the units are on my Corvette as I write this review.
B00068XCQU|5|Great value, great battery tender!
B001AXGT7O|3|hard to adjust to the correct length.  After some machining I got it to work.
B00JX8HA9Y|5|good quality. can't beat the price
B000ALIT5C|1|No fit with my car
B0006JLSN8|5|Works great
B00IAVX7LU|4|received the item seem to work fine.
B004M02RL4|5|Very Nice, heavy duty for sure! Plan on getting a leveling kit and a front end alignment afterwards due to the increased weight. Grill bottom to back of the guard clearance is about 1/4&#34; when opened -Perfect!
B001FE0RN0|5|just what I needed.
B0083KQNBO|4|Surprisingly more heavy duty then expected.
B0067UBTPM|5|arrived early in a very secure package just like I order a fragile electronic gadget, perfect and it fits!
B002BHWZFI|5|Neat product and it works
B00SZZKU02|5|This kit made my 50cc scooter haul &#62;&#62;&#62;!  Excellent value and bang for the buck!
B00FS2TL8W|2|Thin tarp material and The Large size from EPIC will fit up to 108' and for my 2009 Ski doo GTX  I needed over 140 inches so this was way off as you can see by the photo. This cover would be fine if you do not have a 2up seat but if you have a 2up OR high windshield proceed with caution. I actually cracked my mirror trying to just get over the high windshield just to the rear seat ;(  Had to return it, the cover was well packaged however
B00JBZ99PC|5|works perfect
B006FUT0CS|5|I swear by this stuff.  I've had my BMW for almost two years and it's been washed with water only 4 times.  This stuff keeps it shiny and beautiful.
B000CIZZR8|5|Thanks
B00L9VWAUC|4|great price
B0006SU3QW|5|This stuff covers everything.  Make sure you shake the can well before use.  You'll find yourself looking for stuff to plasti dip after you're done with your intended use.
B00GNCTRKS|5|Great product. Easy to install.
B00JEUHWYO|5|Great heavy duty matts fit my jeep cherokee perfect! This has been the best thing I have bought for my jeep so far! I was a little nervous ordering on line that they would seem cheaply made but they are great! They fit perfectly they are heavy duty and easy to clean.
B001QVMXL6|5|The helmet its cool
B00CVLLJ4W|5|Nice I like
B00B19SENO|4|Looks good but the driver's door back end that runs vertically will not stay down.  I clean the surface extremely good and wiped the entire area with alcohol and is not sticking.  I've put these on 5 trucks I've owned pior and have had no problems, not a rookie at installing these.  Would have given 5 stars but not sticking issue only rates a 4.
B00GUA9BYK|5|Wonderful lights.  Quick shipping.  Bought two sets for our RV
B009S9S6JQ|5|Outstanding I love it..
B00X5FL02Y|2|Very cheap/brittle plastic. Rubber gasket inside unit is too thick. Once you put the chip set inside it won't go in properly. I used the rubber gasket from the original key fob and I was able to get it in and closed.
B00EQ461GS|5|Great product.
B008YFTB4E|5|These hid are awesome!! Very bright and easy to install.
B00VX7CK4S|5|There are so many reasons to love this Trash-Zilla Hanging Car Trash Can. The first is the obvious - it's a handy plastic-lined bag to put trash in. It is also a great travel-bag as well as a hiding place for things while you are away from the car. There is a front pocket, two elasticized mesh side pockets (for water bottles, soda cans, etc.), the roomy main bag for trash or storage with a velcro closure, and the adjustable strap for hanging that has a plastic clasp for fastening around something - the back of the headrest, the glove box, etc.). Whoever designed this bag was definitely inspired and it's obvious that a lot of thought went into it. The main bag is big enough for a small laptop or iPad, and I'm thinking it's perfect for stashing my portable GPS or camera when I'm away from the car instead of sticking them in my purse. I love that it says &#34;Trash zilla&#34; on the front with bright blue ink because I would think it would make a lot of people think it's a trash container and wouldn't hold something good in it! I also like the black color. If I put it on the floor of the car, it almost disappears, making another argument for stashing things there while away from the car. The bag seems to be very well made and I think it's kind of cute as well. I will be using this in the car for a long time to come!
B00V5B3PTG|1|Vehicle: 2006 BMW M5 (e60)<br /><br />It is nice looking but does not fit my car! I tried placing it over my OEM emblem and it was a shy to tight. I then decided to &#34;pop&#34; the OEM emblem out only to realize it is hard to get it out without bending the emblem and not being able to use it again. So, now I have a big blue circle that doesn't fit and have to order a new OEM emblem from BMW. It does now work on e60 M5!<br /><br />Needs to come with instructions on how to remove the OEM emblem without breaking it. (Unless the ring is not supposed to be that small. I figured it would just fit over it but, nope)
B0051MYL8E|4|Bought all 3 Viking's microfiber drying towel, wax removal cloth and wax applicator. Drying towel is of decent size and works well. Use wax removal cloths for polishing exterior and interior of car. Size is small yet did the job. The small blue wax applicator sponge absorbed liquid such as tire shine but later use to apply the same for exterior plastics fittings. For all 3, it served the purpose with a good price. Viking's wash bucket is on the way.
B00CHSMISU|2|I had bought a set of these 6 or 7 years ago. The driver's side eventually got worn out, and I decided to get another set. I bought my second set, not from here, but from Quadratec. The set they make now is not the same as the older original. I'm afraid to say that the rubber is different in feel; it's also not as heavy. I'm sending them back and going for something else.
B00BD5GU82|1|They didn't fit what they said they would!
B00HD50BEK|4|4 the price its cool. It's a black light which is a plus.
B0012INT98|5|made our vacation a lot better, hold a lot of luggage.
B00CG0IXCE|2|The piece that was suppose to stick the item to the car did not stick very well at all.
B00C0SQRCU|5|easy to install. works great.
B00061SGZO|5|Very versatile tool. I am glad I got the larger tool with more &#34;attachments&#34;. I have used this tool not only to separate and install ball joints, but I have also used it to press out and install control arm bushings. Well made tool.
B000COAZEK|5|These are truely awesome! Great stopping power!
B00H54K0W2|5|I am a Jersey girl and I love having this on my car. I love the design and have gotten compliments on it. It was easy to put on and the color is very vibrant.
B007KLBDN0|5|Had it on my bike for a year now. Works great,  and great value
B0012BL8LG|5|Perfect
B000EQF8SE|5|Super easy install, nice fit
B002I9OKOS|5|Made from metal. It is GLOSS Black. It looks good.<br />Comes with all parts to install.<br /><br />Edit: I have added a photo.
B00W4IDIGE|5|Looks great on my car and delivered on time
B00E3895EW|5|Was the right part to fix my problem and I received it in a timely manner.
B00JFX6SZO|1|Not sure if this unit is a genuine Motorcraft or a reproduction in a Motorcraft box. Regardless, I was forced to purchase a unit locally as this one came DOA. Good versions of these TFI's are becoming hard to locate.
B0014B9JBK|5|awesome
B00IE3Z4DS|5|This product fit well in the jet ski trailer. Great product.
B00MG687JW|5|work good thanks
B004LF8VRO|5|Worked just like I had hoped.  Fantastic
B005BNP7UO|5|My husband has been wanting one of these forever. We see them everywhere but he always said that they were just to expensive for what they do. He found them here at the General Store for a very suspiously low price but so low I had to take a chance and get one. The test Me Now button for in store display did not work and I suspect that is why they were priced so low but who cares: by time I can use the Test Me Now button its already been bought and shipped to me and in my hands already. I bought another for my son who lives out of state. Thank you for the fantastic deal and product that was processed and shipped to us so quickly. He had the packaged opened and on his truck in less than 5 minutes and then we had to go outside and take a video of the flashers and his new Ford flashing to send to my son. He too thought it was really cool and a great deal. $30 made two grown men act like little girls getting a new Barbie doll dress.
B0018KS5KI|5|Love them
B001FAO8I4|2|Very poor quality - used it three times and it broke ...
B000EZU7OK|3|had to grind a fair amount of material off the back of this alt to make it work on my 66 lemans - was not the same as the original.
B00YOXBXXM|1|Different from pictures and doesn't fit right
B00E7WEFQ2|5|I love these. Easy to install and holds up well in speeds up to 120km/h. No complaints and brings a smile to everyone's face when they see it.
B00KB9LH8E|5|I love this stuff.  This is the first time I've ordered the Vanilla and it's just great.
B00684TAYY|3|I bought two keys. One worked, the other does not. Instructions were not provided with the keys.
B0027EQ59M|5|This filter has literally changed our lives - finally the wife can understand me!<br /><br />.. oh, and it's great for the Volvo too
B002FDQ1AS|3|good
B008OYMYEO|5|Works fine, price was right, and shipping was fast.
B00JRPFKEA|5|Great Stuff!!
B007L58MTS|5|It was the right part..after putting it on the 4 Wheeler starts like it suppose to. Thanks..
B00ECGWRHC|5|WORKS PERFECT
B0016I8E1M|5|I looked at all the different solutions for carrying more gear in my Lexus LX 470. The Rola cargo carrier has lived up to all the 5* reviews I have read. It is a little heavier than some of the other solutions. If you are even in decent shape you should be able to manage getting it on your car or truck. It is SOLID and STURDY. I have a couple of buddies who have used the lower end cargo carriers for years and they always seem to be bending them due to a heavy load or when they hit something with the carrier. That is not that he case with the ROLA. You might as well consider the ROLA to be an extention of your frame. It is that solid. It is supper easy to put together as well. I could not believe how easy it was to assemble. I did have all the right tools but even with basic tools it should not be a problem. I spent more time attaching the light kit than I did assembling the carrier. I highly recommend getting the higher end light kit as well. You do not want anyone running into your carrier as it will tear up their car and not the carrier. The light kit should help prevent that from happening. Solid solution for anyone looking to get a cargo carrier. I will be sharing this solution with my friends as they are always tearing up their cargo carriers.
B0078SZRQO|3|Came broken when I received, will try and buy another one eventually. But wasn't that impressed to what I already have in my car
B000AL8VD2|5|very good
B00QT9TP7A|1|The vehicle-picture is NOT the same as the item-picture component.  The vehicle shows an above-bumper, but the item shows an in-front-of-bumper-push-bar configuration with the tubing bends exactly as a different wholesaler advertised on the well-known on-line auction site.  Additionally the \\"[...]\\" phone number belongs to a marketing scam phone bank, therefore it is impossible to determine what is actually being marketed, and what any warranty might be worth from a company which cannot be reached.
B00LA9B4R8|4|good - I like it
B002G29MAO|3|Ok
B00Y9SDHGS|5|It works great good experience
B00IBH79F8|5|Great product!!
B0006IX7WY|5|Love being able to organize and keep things neat and this helped perfectly with our frig while traveling. No falling objects now when we open the door after traveling!
B0009IBJCQ|5|Schumacher is a great charger I own more than one of them
B00RM327NG|5|Works great! The magnet fits really easily between the case and phone so it's totally invisible.  It took me a few tries to get the right position and placement of the vent attachment so that it didn't slip off or cause the vent direction to slide down but once I got it, it's great.  It even helps my phone stay cool when using it for GPS. It used to get warm with the screen lit for so long but with the AC on, it cools it down. Not sure how that will go in the winter but I'm not worried.  For me, I put it on the bottom slat of the vent and that prevented unwanted movement. I'd definitely buy it again.  Way smaller and more discreet than my previous phone mount.
B000FJS4PO|5|Got this to test by ATV that only has an idiot light that is one and sending unit is $150
B00KS5JJ4A|5|Works wonderful
B0062A7M2G|5|Awesome vinyl 3m makes good products.
B001NJ3H0C|5|Works great , had no problems
B000C1KJ76|5|Great nothing else to say
B005CLMPPK|3|plastic working parts didn't last long.
B008RATKIS|3|Not very easy to install due to inferior design of plastic clips for the screws.  They are very small and hard to pinch into the groove which is necessary to avoid them spinning.  There aren't any extras provided.  They should throw in at least a couple.  I lost one as they are very hard to hold onto while pinching and getting the screw started.  What should be a 10 minute project took me almost an hour.  Also, once installed the hood no longer closes by gently pushing down.  It must be dropped which is contradictory to the instructions.<br /><br />All that said, the protector does look very good, and seems like it will be durable and do it's job well.
B00GXRJIG6|5|Looks beautiful in my truck,,,,
B007HRN4N4|5|Great item, net our needs......
B00LBIUDGQ|1|They do not work at all
B0030GDLTI|5|Fit perfect. I'm very pleased.
B001Y8NEX2|5|used on a canvas screenhouse.  It is in the sun all day long and it stayed in place without the corners curling up!  I highly recommend this product!
B0083CIKKE|5|Great antenna. Goes on easy and is car wash proof. Item arrived in two days
B0002Q81Y4|4|So far so good. Only used for 1 600 mile trip.
B001AJKMTY|5|bought with utility mats for the back....
B001Q7X05I|5|Best chrome cleaner/polish/sealant hands down in my book. Used several others and this is worth the cost!
B0039T059U|5|Did exactly what it was supposed to do!easy to install.
B0046ID5EK|5|Easy to set up and worked great. Make sure if you have 2 of these that you program both at the same time. If you dont program both at the same time the one you don't program will not work.
B000A0CANA|5|Does not looks exactly as the original but it semms it does a very good job.
B00KVPNVJ6|5|Works great. We have very hard water here and this unit really softens it.
B00Q348590|5|Smells a lot like rubber at first, but it will wear off. Other than that, it's a great product!
B00HUYQ8BY|3|Color was a little off of our Summit White 2015 Acadia.  Had a small paint chip that it did cover, but color was just a bit off.  Still looked better than chopped paint.
B00P1KBUGW|5|Exactly as I hoped for!
B00890N6A4|5|Used this for my 75 dodge D-100
B003Y38LII|1|the fragrance doesn't last for a month
B000630254|5|Nice.
B004BCSSMK|5|Love these pedals! Exactly my color. My 510s stick nicely and I never worry about slipping. They're not too thick so I rarely worry about catching a log or rock as I'm rolling over them.
B00NERV3M0|4|Works fine did not match holes .
B00H1IBKIK|5|Exactly as described. Would buy again.
B0023080RU|1|Every single one came off. The adhesive is insufficient once you reach speed on freeway. Yes, these were correctly adhered on clean rims. You are better off getting a different brand.
B004J2GTI2|4|worked well and is cheaper than just stuts if you have to pay someone to move springs
B00VO035ZW|5|This is a nice mirror.  It gives a nice wide view and stays where you put it. Very happy with iy
B000FOKC9K|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B002KOBTFO|5|Worked Great!!!!
B003276LDI|5|GOOD
B0058J4X1K|5|Excellent
B000CIPE9M|5|This is the best way to protect the bed of your truck and looks great. The 3/4&#34; of foam on the floor is a great also
B00GBP89RO|5|Access tonneau covers are the best you can get for a very reasonable price! We've had 2 now, one for our first truck and we liked that one so much we got another for our brand new 2015. This tonneau cover looks better than any of the ones you could buy from the dealers!
B004AIIVUO|5|Awesome fit perfectly with excellent online video
B00NXEB4UA|2|Product not as fully described, process is extremely difficult. Make sure to have sown one professionally install.
B002P8QGW6|4|Took the old off put this new one on with no problems. Motor works. Very happy costumer.
B000EQS1XS|5|Paired with the Low Note, works well and loud enough.
B00651C4EI|5|Very easy to install.  It took all of 10 seconds to figure out which of the adapters was needed to screw this in.  I wrenched out the stock metal whip and screwed this one in by hand in just a minute.  Since I'm all about loctite, I did use a dab of red loctite on the threads (i know i know).<br /><br />The reception has been working fine. We have decently strong signals in North Austin so I wouldn't have detected any real problems anyway.  While driving even moderate speeds the antenna does lean back from the wind.  At high speed it doesn't bend back much more if at all.  Once you're at a standstill, the antenna flexes back upright but not completely.  It springs back however you bend it but not completely.<br /><br />The antenna had zero issues in the automatic carwash.  Sure it moves around some but no danger of it ripping off.  I was in the car during the wash.
B007PJA2HA|3|Now that i have it i wonder about whether i shouldn't have just bought the taller permanent one.  Since i most likely will never lower this thing by taking off the top section.
B00FY813OU|5|Although Amazon says it would not fit (and Dorman too for that matter), after reading some reviews and questions I decided to try.  It fit my 2009 LT Silverado Crew Cab front passenger door, WITH power locks, perfectly. I can only assume it will fit driver side also. I had just replaced a rear driver side lock actuator that came with a cable, and it looked to be same length as that also
B00GHRUQGS|5|if you order this item be careful that when you open it look at it because out of 5 i order 2 were crack and broken the good news is that amazon made it real easy for an exchange. the item fit my hummer h3 2006. great quality and it looks good. and it was like the picture
B00Z6HFEEO|5|This my second buy, Works great and looks cool.
B00R0424JO|1|There were instructions?  Wow!  These other reviews refer to instructions...where?  Two strings came in an otherwise empty card board box.
B0050EILKC|5|Perfect for that step down from our RV. Very sturdy and folds perfectly to fit in an outside cargo hold.
B000GU20K2|5|Great replacement for OEM part.  Looks great and was easy to install.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Easy and straight forward. Plug it in and it charges my phone or portable battery.<br /><br />Great for long motorcycle trips. Keep it plugged into your portable battery in a pannier bag. If you just keep your phone plugged in it will stop charging once its full. If you charge your large portable battery, then you have 2 or 3 times the charge.<br /><br />Then when you stop for the night you can plug in all your goodies such as a helmet communicator.
B0001CMUV4|5|This product does exactly what it says it does; mainly, removes the slack between the receiver and hitch.  The use of this product virtually eliminates the noise caused by the movement of the hitch and almost makes you forget you are pulling a trailer.  I leave my hitch permanently mounted and this product stays on as well.  You would have to loosen and/or remove this product if you were to take the hitch out of the receiver.  I use this with a boat trailer, jetski trailer and a cargo trailer with no issues.  I have not used this with a bike rack or other apparatus but assume it would work great based on its operation with the trailers.  Well worth the money and wish I had found it years ago.
B007GREK88|5|One of the best upgrades to my bike.
B00GJ1EZSC|5|Perfect solution for the do it yoursefer
B00HE6CI58|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. They are pretty bright so don't be surprised, but my guess is that's what you're looking for and these are an awesome replacement for the yellow halogen bulbs in your dome or map lights. I use LEDs for most of my bulbs and I bought the pair only planning to use one for the dome light, but after seeing it I popped the second one into the map light to see how it looked - well now I'm ordering a second set. It's only day 1 so I'll see how they hold up, but my first impression as is that this is a quality product.<br /><br />I'm including a comparison picture of the LED and stock halogen bulbs in the map lights in my 2011 Accord Coupe.
B00CFM9QLA|5|Purchased this for my convertible Mustang and keep all my beach towels, re-usable grocery bags, car cleaners, small took kit, and microfiber car duster completely organized in the trunk. It's really fantastic, holds a lot, can collapse for easy storage, and keeps the interior of my car free from clutter.
B00EUZJ6P6|1|Product great but check the size!
B00HB5JK5I|1|Worst purchase EVER. Rotors warped within 2k miles. 2 piece rotors shouldn't warp this easy. RB wont even return my calls or emails for help. Wasted over $800 buying these for my Golf R. DON'T BUY from this place EVER!!!!!
B009I24MOG|5|We just bought a 2007 Escalade ESV, and it was missing the back carpet.  After looking around, and seeing the crazy prices on other brand cargo mats, I read the reviews on the FH Group Trimmable Cargo Mat and decided to give it a try.  I was amazed at how perfect the color is, and after a little bit of trimming, the mat fits perfectly!  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.  We did not have any problems with rolling up, and it laid flat immediately after opening it.
B00HJJCYY0|5|Excellent.
B00UPOB1VS|5|thank you
B00CZQ9UZI|3|Overall looks good, fit perfectly and easy to install. However, after a couple of weeks of light use (it is not our daily driver) the driver's side cover on the side bolster area is fraying.  There is an area on the cover where the hip meets the seat that is now all fuzzy looking. Might just be the nature of the material, but I was hoping it would hold up better and look as nice as it did when first installed.
B00UA4RL0I|5|Works very well.  Keep surface being cleaned well lubricated.
B00LFPBZ12|5|Thank you guys.this is a great unit I really recommend it I install this unit on the tundra sounds awesome what I did was I bought and replace a pressure switch to 175 psi and 200 psi release it works even better with 3/8 OD airline. Everybody loved his unit it is really loud for those who don't know what to get this is the one and is good for the price The money it's worth it I really recommend it guys.hope this helps good luck guys
B0009IQZPW|5|Works as expected, no issues with use
B00NIZZZ5Y|4|Just as good as the OEM part.
B009PNEIHY|4|It fits perfect very happy
B00HB0WUB4|2|I tried it on a cross country trip  wasn't  as good as I hoped ...... it surprised me  with a name like RidX  first of their product I didn't  like
B002P3LLPS|3|Like the glasses but disappointed because I thought they were photo lens wanted a pair that was clear at night and turned dark in the sunlight was mislead on what I was getting.
B000VKYGVS|5|Great bite, no noise, reduced fade, and just a tad more dust than stockers.  I've been using this compound on my daily drivers for years and have had nothing but positive experiences.
B009PV8V60|5|works well
B00Y8Q96K2|1|Too small, measurements are the circumference, not lengh or width......rip off!
B000COMUR0|5|Fit perfect!
B001A0F88I|4|Very handy and so glad I bought these.  Mounting was tenuous and not easy, but the end result is excellent.  Hauling two motorcycles side-by-side is really tough when the only tie-down is low in the bed.  These are a life-saver.
B000BGK22E|5|as described. Thanks!
B00F9EE6BQ|5|Strong products
B00P2PJI7Y|1|did not fit
B003FBV8ZW|4|We bought these for when we ride our Harley. These glasses were very helpful and I loved the colors they came in.
B00SQNJS7Y|5|Good looking and seem to holding up well great deal
B0085ILH42|5|Easy install looks great
B00NUEG1DS|4|It work for me no problem on AM or FM stations at this length.
B008RU3FRA|1|for some reason it explosed on being connected
B008CE0TI4|5|Got these with my Scamp trailer three years ago and would have been lost without them. So when I did lose them, I ordered myself another set. I can't back my 16 foot , single axle trailer without them. And I've been known to do a one try back up with these balls.
B00KTM2BJM|5|Fit perfectly in a 2006 honda crv
B00CHDHJUC|5|Great Fit!!!!
B008KZQWRM|4|Looks and fits good, hoping last longer than a year like the last one.
B008OXIYM6|5|These are fantastic.  I use these to replace tires/swap, do anything that requires taking the tire off.  They work great, no more struggle.  Very light too and take up almost no room compared to what they enable an individual do.
B000C2YXSG|5|I've been using Fram for 23 years, and never a problem, even when I miss the recommended interval by a few thousand miles. The rubberized end makes it easy to twist off without a wrench.
B007I8X7VQ|5|Fast delivery.  Product as described
B00K3YFHM4|5|fit well
B00NXRXGLC|2|Most of the reviews were from individuals who received them for demo from Amazon.<br />Purchased based on reviews. The right wiper leaves a gap on the upstroke. It does not sit flat to the glass.<br />They're also a bit noisy.<br />Sorry, but I don't recommend these.
B00F8LEB9W|5|arrived on time and did what it was expected to do ~ Thanks!
B004W6FSO6|5|I was backed into in a parking lot. The lady went out of her way to find me inside the store. Since this was such a minor incident, I agreed to taking her personal information. I went on line and found the light I eventually purchased. I went to NAPA and some other retail stores and found that the price was sooooo much higher. Since the online store was EXACTLY the same!!!!!. It was easy to install. I dropped the tail gate, removed two screws, pulled the light out, unplugged the cord, popped the new one in and re-attached the screws. If you can put together LEGOs, you can do this. The light worked great, the lady who hit me was over joyed that it wasn't more expensive.(around 40 bucks). She sent me a check and hope that both of our Carmas were increased. Thanks for the great price.
B002R0BD4I|5|Fits perfect! Looks great. I've ordered other products from these guys and have been very happy!
B00GRHSU5C|5|Awesome product. Very happy with quality and price.
B001B59BX0|2|This is an initial installation review: The kit comes with everything you see in the picture. The clutch and the pressure plate fit well in the ZX3 trim of the Ford Focus. The pressure plate needed some persuasion, ie: rubber mallet, to fit on the OEM flywheel, Perhaps it needs the EXEDY flywheel?<br />The throw-out bearing was another issue. It does not match at all the OEM part in shape or fit. I ended up not using it (not recommended) and installing the other parts. I will test the clutch feeling and durability later. 8/20/2015
B003VAYK3Y|5|Works great and easy to assemble
B0085D1AVM|2|You really have to be a fan to appreciate this cheap plastic frame.  I hope she likes it.....
B000CB0KQ6|5|This item was just what I needed, and was an exact fit thanks.
B00XKLIKKI|5|Excellent tool. I highly recommend using this tool that has very positive grip on both the base of the cartridge filter housng as well as the ribs. My sienna van had previously only been serviced by Toyota and the housing was extremely tight. I had tried using an oil filter wrench but it wasn't a perfect fit and was at risk of stripping the housing. This tool has two places it grips, preventing damage.
B007NKPG36|5|Bad ass works great small footprint and will run lots of leds at the same time
B000BUU5YA|5|life saver. you literally should not be allowed to RV camp without one of these
B000CHMME8|5|The best tensioner on the market.  If you need a new tensioner this is the one to get.  Well built and will outlast Dayco, Litens, Mubea, and Ina.
B00EECM5FI|5|Pain to install.... but best clean light for the road!
B000JWJLEA|1|I returned this product, it never works for me
B00NF18CVK|5|Do I love it? Probably not.<br /><br />However, it replaces the stock part perfectly. It fit without issue and looks just like the original part. What else is there to say about it? If I had the capacity to love a plastic seat part then I would.
B00IKPVT7K|4|It works
B000C5ESQU|5|works just as well as original on a BMW z4
B00BFDGZV4|5|It fit my 2004 honda odyssey perfectly.
B008SEM724|5|I guess I should put 5 stars for this. It replaced the original, broken fog lights on my 2004 Suburban perfectly and it looks and performs awesome. I just don't like the stock mounting method. It doesn't seem like it secures the light as much as I would like. That's not the fault of this product though. For the price it's hard to beat it.
B00574TAXC|5|Has plenty of length to it, worked perfect with my aftermarket stereo in my 2005 honda accord. Installed with no problems in under 5 minutes. Had it for about 5 months now and haven't had a single problem, it's a great product on my point of view
B005OZNAS0|1|No chip inside of these keys making it useless.
B00OGUKSYI|5|Very fast shipping from Arsenal Offroad - I had the lights at my house less than 48 hours after placing my order. Excellent packaging, very professional looking. A very nice quality 20A switch was included, as well as two different types of mounting clips. After mounting them though, I can say that I'm less than impressed with the curved aluminum mounts - they are low quality aluminum and are a little too thin. One of them got really torn up/bent by the locking nut when I tried to lock the lights into position.  I ended up switching to the steel mounts, and while they don't have the same adjustability as the aluminum ones, they are much more solid. If the stronger mounts hadn't been included, I probably would have docked them a star. The lights themselves are BRIGHT. I'm very impressed - for the money, these little guys are tough to beat for auxiliary lighting. They pack quite a punch, and are nearly bright enough to drive with at night with nothing else turned on. I say &#34;nearly&#34; because the beam doesn't have quite enough throw for me to feel comfortable at higher speeds. Still though, for two little lights this size, that's really impressive. I have them center mounted on a Go-Rhino push bumper right now, but they will get moved up near the windshield/hood once I get a 32&#34; light bar to take their place. Once they are set up for off-axis lighting and used in conjunction with a bigger light bar, I think they will really shine (no pun intended). Buy these lights - you won't be disappointed.
B00NXA8X8A|4|Very good product. Easy to install.
B007M5QH4Y|5|Easy installation
B00UW1T31Y|5|Perfect fit for a '98 Camry (4 cyl).
B000GZPH2U|5|I got this item for my husband and he loves it.
B00KJGPMZI|5|Bought so my wife and I could communicate while on long road trips. Work absolutely flawless. I do wish there were a wider range of Bluetooth GPS capable of connecting to the headsets but a phone works just fine.
B00O4DPE4G|3|super cute but peeled off my car within weeks
B000AMBOI0|5|Works as advertised. Good price
B00274JM7E|5|If you ever find yourself looking for tissues while driving, STOP NOW! This is so handy and amazing! I can't believe I didn't know about this sooner. Its so easy to just look up and grab a tissue when you need to.
B00KTIYXLU|5|I ordered this product on a Saturday. I paid no extra shipping and I got it on Monday!! The total length of time from me opening the package and until both fobs were programmed and working for my car was less than 1 minute!  I couldn't believe it. HIGHLY recommend. Glad I looked here. other places are charging way more. What a pleasant surprise from start to finish!
B00IS93BCE|5|Very sharp looking bumper good fit easy install
B00GDR5O28|5|flywheel came out easily with this puller. used for 1997 Honda CR80R
B00F8RGYJG|2|Pros: when I received the wrong product (mis-spelled) they sent me a new one as soon as they can.<br />Cons: After a year or so, the product has rusted (and we keep our car in the garage when we are home). It says in the description that it won't rust, and yet it has. Just overall, I wouldn't buy this product again if I had a chance to do it over.
B000C9H1A6|5|Perfect fitting oem quality wires. They fit my 95 YJ four cylinder even though Amazon says they do not fit my vehicle. I had to order the set for a 99 tj get a four cylinder set.
B00027GZDC|1|Didn't get everything in the picture that's supposed to be included in a water pump kit. Its missing the housing and I wasted my money. I didn't even ask fot a refund because I didn't wanna deal with the hassle.
B00A71IJTG|1|should've listened to some of the other reviews..<br />The precision of the thread is so bad that if I would actually completely screw them on, they would certainly not come off anymore.<br />Also, since it's not fulfilled by Amazon, there's no returns :(
B00VVEWQ2Y|5|Works well Thank you
B003NICPWC|5|Very strong lift supports, would not trade them for any other brand. I will get strong arm's for my hood.
B00QW3VZIA|5|Great.
B000Q3OTQC|5|I have always been a fan of K&N and i am very happy with this filter. I told my neighbor and he bought ine too. Recommend it
B000BYENJO|5|Worked great
B00UCNCSJ6|3|not to good
B00FH43U0G|4|This helmet is very good quality. The face shield seals well and minimizes noise. There is still a good amount of air flow into the helmet with the vents closed but that is part of riding a motorcycle. With the vents open I was cool enough on a humid 92 degree day while moving. Needed to open the face shield when stopped. When taking the helmet off the back pad is fairly hard and digs into the back of your head if you full the front of the helmet up and over your head but if you pull the helmet straight up this is not a problem. I would recommend getting a different visor or wearing sun glasses while riding on a sunny day as the helmet does have a large visual field and can be awful bright. Overall the helmet is a very good design, snell and DOT approved. Luckily have not had to test the durability of the helmet in a wreck yet and hope it stays that way but I am confident that it will hold up. Ride smart!
B00KJ8JCKW|5|Very bright HID's. Ballasts are nice and slim, & will fit in tight places. Shipping was quick.
B00ESCWBX0|5|sick graphics
B000N9VF6Q|3|Not sure this helped much.<br />If I were to do it over again I would get the smallest house expansion tank and fit it in.
B00QFT09WE|5|I'll admit my expectations where low when ordering these but for the price it was worth the risk vs spending over $100 on custom billet ones. I was actually AMAZED at how flexible the vinyl was contouring to all the corners, multiple angles, and edges on my bowties. The package comes with an instruction sheet that says use a NEW razor blade. I thought I knew better and used an old razor and ended up snagging on it in a spot or two so I have a spot that isn't perfect. That's my fault, not the product, I should have used a sharper razor.
B00B5WL4HK|3|After reading the reviews on Amazon about this product, I requested it as a Father's Day gift and anxiously waited to use it. I own a 2014 Hyundai Sonata Limited, black in color. I should point out that I have purchased over 30 new cars in my lifetime and have kept almost all of them in like-new condition while owning them. Having purchased approximately 20 different types and brands of car wax, I believe I can speak with some authority. This wax really disappointed me, especially for the price my daughter must have paid for it. When I was not satisfied with the first coat of Pinnacle I applied and buffed, I did a second coat. The second coat did not result in a significant improvement in depth and shine. It certainly doesn't exceed other waxes I've used that cost less than half the price of Pinnacle, and in some cases it didn't meet the shine of other waxes.<br /><br />I could mention the name of these other products, but that isn't the point of my review. Is this a good wax? Yes. Is it a superior wax? Not in my opinion, and certainly not worth twice the price of other great waxes.
B00ILUW28E|5|It's easy to swap out and test system
B00JA396BC|3|These wipers are supposed to replace the Super Sporza Silicone blades.  I could immediately tell that these are not nearly as good.  Bummed!
B00NSA37UO|5|Very Nice
B00VO8EVIY|4|Product as described
B00BTGSID0|5|These clothes work well for many different uses. I use them to clean my bike, car, truck, TV's, Glasses, Interiors and anything else you can think of
