0375842209|3.0|I was told that this was a book for young adults.  I don't agree with that.  It is a somewhat horrifying book and one that I think many young adults are not ready for.  Death is such a complex character to be used as the narrator.  I've read other books dealing with the the traumas of World War II.  This one was one of the more devastating.  I do think the story should stand as a testament to the strength of man's ability to inflict cruelty to his own kind and a reminder that we should think of ourselves as charged with defeating this type of cruelty.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good finale to the Hunger Games.  This book shows that in politics, both sides have their agenda and Katniss and Peta are in the middle.  The ending was fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great read! no one should be disappointed, its a lot different from the movie but better! I'll be continuing the series!
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I would give this 5 stars but on my kindle 7&amp;#34; hdx it frequently closes anytime I try to change backgrounds or move to the next level.
B000WGZGNS|4.0|I've actually seen this show on tv but they didn't show half the stuff on DVD . In my opinion it was one the best shows out of all of her tours
1609611543|4.0|Text fully explained rationale behind the diet.  We are following the 'wheat-free' plan for three weeks and I have lost about 3-4 pounds - but I didn't have much to lose in the first place (pants fit better, too!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great  wish it told more about the boosters when they come up on screen how to use them more like when they get that little number by them.
B0000009S3|5.0|a beautiful blend of stravinski, creative upcoming zappaesque classical, with zaapa's own brand humor-- including  the soon to be famous jon luc ponty, and the undeniably unique madman musical tour de force -- captain beefhart on the illustrative 'willie the pimp.'  if you're looking to dance and hum,  look elsewhere -:- if you're looking for your mind to dance and hummm-- then play on
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Since the last update I have to try multiple times to access gifts and friends boards. It's becoming a pain. Please fix this glitch!
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|I can watch this DVD every week.  It's a great funky romance story with a totally different twist.  The music is awesome as well.  A feel good, no screwy special effects, non violent, family movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is fun and kid friendly if you like to play the games where you have to go through certain levels and collect things and if you like the minions you will LOVE this app
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|There's some crazy column that takes up a half inch of the right part of the screen as you play.<br /><br />Update: I rebooted my kindle and the issue resolved itself. It hasn't returned since, restoring this game back in its full glory!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|lots of fun... addictive and exciting ... a little more realism would make app that much better... i.e. animals reacting to you being near them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All of my friends had begun to play candy crush. I kept saying I wouldn't play because it's so addictive. While out of town, my boyfriend`s phone went dead so he downloaded on to my phone. I can't quit playing it!!!!
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|I felt like it was a slight step up from their third album &#34;ABIII&#34;, but still nowhere near the quality of their first two albums.<br /><br />I think part of the problem is that while Myles Kennedy has a nice voice, it is quite a bit higher pitched than your average rock singer, so whereas in the first two albums he would use that to his benefit by some of the calming &#34;oooohs&#34; and &#34;aaaaahs&#34; and a few slower songs, on this album (and ABIII) those kinds of songs or portions of songs are absent and it's replaced with Kennedy's full on version of power vocals which starts to almost sound kind of nasally and whiny and doesn't complement Tremonti's guitar work all that well.<br /><br />The music itself isn't bad, but sometimes less is more, and there's just so much going on at once that it all blends together into noise instead of beauty.  Some contrast would have helped.  It's also still lacking those monstrously awesome guitar solos from Tremonti that we saw in the first two albums.  There are some good ones here, but again, not on the level of Blackbird.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love the love stories that Nicholas Sparks writes. They are tender, sweet, and bittersweet.  He describes the scenes so well that one almost feels as if they are there.  The emotions of his characters are right on with real life.  This book is no different.  One can see the cottage and the garage clearly, and feel the passion between Amanda and the two men in her life.  The emotions Amanda feels about her history with one, as well as her history with her children is made vivid in Nicholas' writing.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|It took me a long time to read this book.  Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors, but this book just never grabbed me.  Every time I got into a character... They would just disappear for a long time. Also, there never was any serious conflict with the characters to keep me interested.  Also, I felt like I would read one line about a character, and then a large paragraph about world history.  (Repeat again and again, until the book ends.) -- Not what I was looking for in a book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a perfect mystery game and for me the replay value is very high, even when you solve the mystery it is very fun
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome read. I enjoyed it. It started out slow but it quickly pieced together everything I wanted to know. I was thinking something different at the beginning not at all how it ended.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|There is no picture save function. The app can only post pictures to social media. I would like to be able to save and then edit.
0425252868|5.0|I have been an avid reader of Vietnam, Falklands, Gulf wars, Middle East and special forces, but not so much WW2.<br /><br />After reading this book, that will all change.  This is an incredible story from both sides of the coin.<br /><br />This book should be a compulsory read for all high school students to understand a little bit on war and humanity.<br /><br />The author (Adam Makos and team), you did a fantastic job, well done sir!<br /><br />(I am now looking forward to reading more of your work, it should be delivered any day now).
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I was never a Stewart fan until I found The Great American Songbook - and I love all the volumes I've heard. While I think you have to appreciate and enjoy the music itself, you also have to have an open mind and allow yourself to &#34;get&#34; Rod Stewart. I'm happy to say that, with his performances for The Great Amercan Songbook series, I do, indeed, &#34;get&#34; him.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Since I was first introduced to this novel as a teenager, I have taken time at least once a year to reread it. The characters in this book have become old friends. Even though there are some great video depictions of the story, the book is even better.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great. I use this all the time.if you need to add, subtract multiply or divide, this is the application for you.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved every word!! I could not put it down. Grisham at his best. Don't miss this one for any reason!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game! If you're a kid like me, you will find this game challenging and fun. It is awesome!
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  Laughed all the way through!  Hubby liked it too which is very rare for us to both like the same movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When you start playing, this is engaging and fun. At first, the restriction of playing time was a good thing, especially for children. Now I just get frustrated, because the challenge is addictive!!!
B0093Q9Y7W|4.0|Great movie.  Older movie. Special effects not as effective as newer movies can portray. Story is sad but true. Music is fantastic.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I like the colorful bubbles. Game is easy to play at first. Gets harder the higher you go up in levels
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I read a lot of books about food and health. This is hands down the best one I've read. It's a well-researched, up-to-date account of how our brain works and how to eat for optimal health. I'm recommending it to everyone I know!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions! this is a really fun game. okay animation.  still fun though. A little lag sometimes but not a whole lot.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|Free for prime member before Thor II, now I need to pay for it when Thor II is on? It is really disgusting. Okay, I quit, Amazon.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|One of the funniest adult movies I have seen in a long time. A great cast. Some really hysterical scenes had me laughing!
B000006NX5|5.0|Absolutely fantastic album.  This was my first exposure to Barry White music.  Brings back so many memories and feelings.  Even though Barry is more famous for his &#34;songs&#34;, if it wasn't for his instrumentation and orchestral accompaniments, he wouldn't be as famous and original as he's been.  I big salute to Gene Page too, for without him, Barry might not have that SPECIAL sound.
B008JFURII|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. It had a few funny scenes. Bruce Willis is one of my favorites. It had some great actors
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I was truly enraptured with this book.  The characters were so interesting and believable.  Quite a fascinating story with surprising<br />and changing directions.  The one thing I was a little difficult is the detail of the many botanical species.  Sometimes hard to follow.  But, aside of this the book was a very worthwhile read!!
B00AAAKH80|5.0|Great album at a good price!  It has a number of the popular songs that you hear on the radio.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun, just wish you didn't have to wait so long for new life. would definitely recommend to others.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I have fallen in love with Emeli Sande. This is the first time I had ever heard of her, but was very pleased with the whole album. Everything on this album sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see her live in concert. This is one of the best finds that I have found this year!
B004N6369Y|3.0|A very heartwarming story. The plot was excellent. Not a lot of action, but very interesting. A good read, in general
0547884591|4.0|Still digging through this many moons later, but I swear, my scrambled eggs have never tasted so good! Thank you!
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Workes every good with my kindle fire HDX . Glad I tried it. You should also give it a try. Allows multiple locations so if you are going some where you can check be four you leave. Great help in packing for the weather.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is a must read. I really like the idea of making gratitude a mandatory teaching in schools. Can you imagine how the world would be if \\"The Magic\\" was part of the curriculum in all schools. To teach our children how to be grateful for what they have and towards each other would end a lot of the issues that we face daily.  It's a shame that unblemished children are taught to hate someone because of their religion, color of their skin or sexual preferences or for whatever other reason. The Magic has made a difference in my life as well as a few family members and friends. It would really be nice if gratitude was taught in ALL our schools.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun game. The graphics and sound effects are great. I enjoy the different levels and special incentives as the game progresses. I'm glad I chose this one.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|What a horrible reinterpretation of Superman.  Dark and brooding is Batman.  We already have that character.  Why not just make a proper Superman film instead of giving him the Dark Knight treatment?  I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is familiar with the character.
072325804X|5.0|My five year-old daughter has come to love the world of Beatrix Potter through this beautiful book.  It is nice and big, well-constructed, and I see it lasting for many years.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn always does a good job of developing the protagonist and antagonist characters as well as providing crises, action, and plausible outcomes.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Beautiful graphics, cute story, I like there's a map and unlimited hints if you choose to use them. Discover the items to solve several puzzles game, no hard logic puzzles. No hidden object scences where you search for random unnecessary stuff. Just a smooth adventure game with no bugs found that I really enjoyed and imo is worth the $.99
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I love superman movies and this was definitely a feast for the eyes but they changed superman fundamentally when they did the final fight. Superman does not do what superman did in this movie and superman was very wooden with hardly any humor what so ever I would rate it lower but the fight scenes were fantastic and all in all it was an enjoyable movie just not what I expected.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|Not what I thought it was, not scientific, doesnt produce a running answer.  Have to press equal after every entry
0385537131|4.0|One of his better boiler plate books. I do enjoy them and this one has more complexity that is typical of his style. Perfect reading for a airplane trip across country.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and addicting game for the whole family!  My family plays together and tries to beat each other's score!  Easy for any age to play!
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|the figures awesome its solid but it has trouble standing up has to be positioned just right, the packaging is too weak to keep it as a collectors item because its too heavy the joints don't move shoulda been classified as a statue not an action figure finally dont buy it from american toy co i preordered it and the release date was postponed i didnt know so after about a month i contacted them saying i never got my item i got a nasty email back from their customer service pretty much saying when we get it you'll get it  i held my tongue and waited figuring when i got around to writing a review it would include them because i wrote them a simple email and pretty friendly email and the response was way off base i dont believe the customers always right i know it to be far from true but don't expect for people to give you their money and then treat them with no respect its unacceptible
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This movie is very touching! I love Denzel Washington and he played his character very well on this movie. The movie is not just about plane crash but it has a deep sense to it.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A very believable novel without a Hollywood ending. A must read. The supposed protagonist is a girl you hope will see the light. You assume she will.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Jim Carrey plays his role extremely well and is an AWESOME Grinch...  An excellent family holiday movie for all ages.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is an awesome game except the infrared runs out very quickly on some guns .I suggest you get this game . It is a great game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really did not know what to expect when I first downloaded this game. As I started playing it I realized how fun it was. The only thing that really caught me up was the wait time between game level/worlds. Because I will not pay for immediate gratification I have to wait 3 whole days.  24 hrs for each mini game to level up and beat. What a waste for player time. Huge turnoff.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Never gives you gems.You can't tap the ball enough,so it falls,then you cannot get enough stars.SSSSSOOOOOOOOOOO glad it didn't cost $!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:(:(:(:(
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Listen to this recording and then listen to the first brilliant Boston record back to back and it will become obvious what a lifeless dishrag this is. Mediocre writing, terribly programmed mushy sounding drum machines, combined with terrible mix and mastering production make for a painfully lifeless and distracting listening experience.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this. Put on the first record enjoy the magic.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a great game for dc fans of all ages young to old you will enjoy this game like how I did
B008JFUS0U|2.0|I like Thor still, but thought this movie was all over the place.  I appreciate movies that attempt to bring multiple genres together, but this never felt like it pieced itself together very well.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Twice I got up to the 45 level range and application deleted itself to the cloud. Redownload and starts me back at level 1. Not fooling me again. DONE!!!
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|At first, I thought this show was stupid--still do, but the comedy that's integrated into it makes up for it.
0062502182|4.0|Not Coelho's best, but consistent with the essential ideas of his better works. The text is readable even if not distinguished.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is the best game in the world the one thing I don't like is waiting for more life's but its awesome
B001706I5I|2.0|Didn't play on my vizio tv app that was disappointing. possibly could have asked for support but don't need the hassle.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|Ok. Not as good as the trailer would have you primed for. Saw a very political ploy with this film. Ex vets, right wingers... Ya I get the picture. Probably why it didn't do great in theaters.
B008ROG6E0|4.0|This movie has always been a childhood favorite.  I especially like all Sci-Fi films.  This is a great old B movie but still fun to watch.
160459201X|5.0|The best book ever if you want to understand how to retrain your brain to get results you want. Even my kids read it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the third time I've read this book...it keeps drawing me back and in. Such a fine trilogy. Just glad that I'm reading this after book three has been released so I don't have to wait.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|The more they make these movies the Better they get and thats what I love about them. Just preorderd mine tonight and hopefully the shipping is fast and I get it asap next week!!<br />R.I.P Paul Walker You will be missed.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Great production values, but mediocre story.  Turn off your disbelief and enjoy the action,  Don't worry about the loose ends.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Great game! If you like racing games, this is a fun twist. I've played more old-school PC games before like Motorcross Madness, Monster Truck Madness, and Midtown Madness, just to name a few, and I enjoy this variation on your typical racing game where this is played not on a dirt race track or a closed circuit road but on water. Want to race computer opponents and try to win medals--on a hydro jet? Want to try to beat your time while doing mid-air stunts at top speeds racing through narrow canals and going over jumps? Don't get distracted by the beautiful scenery or elegant graphics; you won't want to take your eyes off the road, as it were. Fortunately the only time you can crash in this game is if you fail to complete a stunt before landing on the water again. Then just tap the screen once to resume where you left off. No restarting the level or anything. It's very user-friendly and easy to pick up. I love the feel and fluidity of the game (pun intended). I also like how when I leave the game and get back into it, the app will keep me on the screen that I left off from. It doesn't take you to a main menu or make you wait to load new features. It doesn't appear to beg for comments or ratings either like so many other games do, but I was so taken with this FAOTD that I made myself stop playing briefly to write this review; I wanted to let everyone know I love this game! I would definitely recommend it as a stellar app, particularly as today's freebie. If you can get it today I think you will have hours ahead of enjoyable play in front of you. If not today, I would say it's worth the money to buy.
B00G9IMJ3S|3.0|Morrissey's sentences are paragraphs, his paragraphs are chapters, and his chapter (which there is only one) is a whole book.<br /><br />Reading the book reminds me of a lyric from his song &#34;Get Off the Stage&#34;:  &#34;A verse drags on like a month drags on; it's very short, but it seems very long.&#34;
B0055S348W|5.0|Works well for the Kindle Fire and my SAMSUNG WIFI printer.  Easy to make selections and works with most software.
0345530578|4.0|Very good!  I nice break from the monotony of the southern racial tension theme.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters and felt behind the main character in his thrust to move forward.  I really enjoyed the journey to the end and I look forward to more books like this from Grisham.<br /><br />Really good, even if you are burnt out on his recurring theme of racial injustice in the south.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great access to all the social interchange you can stand. quick loading, great updates, manage your profile and your contacts with ease
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. It's almost like playing chess...it makes you think. I can see why everyone was talking about Candy Crush.
B000FA675C|3.0|Dan Brown is an excellent writer and this was a best seller. Yet it was just too far fetched for me.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Favorite movie ever.  Makes me laugh time after time.  Love to watch it around the holidays especially when I am having a hard time getting into the holiday spirit.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Pros:<br />- Youtube streaming works pretty well with my iPad mini.  I can send Youtube videos from my device to TV very easily.  The picture quality is not great, but it's not bad either.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Don't count on being able to stream your computer's screen to your TV from Chrome.  The Chrome extension can be very buggy.  It barely functions on one of my computers and on the other one, it's totally unusable.  I looked online and lots of other buyers are having problems too.  Even when it works, there's a lot of lag even though my internet connection is fairly fast.<br />- An Apple TV would've been a much better since I use Apple devices.  I thought this would be almost as good, but it's really not.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I stopped reading it halfway through because I was bored with the repeated story line.. It is the same thing... Lavish life, sex, lavish life, sex, sex, sex, sex.  There's no excitement, nothing that makes me want to keep reading.
B000P0J06U|5.0|I put together awesome christmas themed movies as a white elephant gift, the best part was it's now a gift for me too. I bought it in a hurry cause it was a great price I didn't realize it also digitally downloaded on my amazon prime library. So I have a hard copy to give away and a digital copy for me.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a lot of the same thing over and over.  I did read the entire thing hoping it would get better each chapter.. and then I started on the next one in the trilogy, but I don't feel it was ever that good and I stopped reading halfway through the second one.  If you like reading just to kill time then go ahead.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|This was the perfect addition to my Christmas movie collection I started for a white elephant gift. Who needs another copy of A Christmas Story when you can get a mogwai story?
0394800184|5.0|This was my kids (now 40) favorite book.  I now buy it for a shower &#34;card&#34;.  Everyone loves it and most know it.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is a baby mini streamer in it's infancy that really has no apps yet but can stream chrome content but how can you go wrong for $30 bucks unless you already have a way to get the phone to communicate with the tv which I do and a &#34;smart&#34; tv which I do as well.  I'm keeping it because I know they're going to come out with updates.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Love CHER!  Love the songs on this CD.  After the holidays I am going to play this each and everyday.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|I love this movie and especially the GTO that the star drives in it! This movie has some great actor's and is very enjoyable!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Mind-boggling,intensive, and thought provoking.  Kept my interest throughout the entire story.  Good science-fiction rather than an entirely action or fantasy movie.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Great movie!! Love Steve Carell, funny and quirky movie that I would recommend to everyone wanting a funny quirky type of movie experience!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake is one of my favorite country artists.  He has a soulful quality to his voice that can't be duplicated. I have all his releases and this one is just as great. If you are a fan or know one, they will love getting this album!
6305428220|5.0|I like this movie, it's a bit creepy and Josh Hartnett drives a cool 70' Pontiac GTO, although it gets wrecked which I don't like so much! I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a creepy alien takes over the school type of flick!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have the Kindle edition and the navigation and lay out is just fine; easy to find the book I want and there are so many (Maybe Complete?)  I watched the BBC &#34;Sherlock&#34; and so I bought this book collection and it's really something to see how much the writers of &#34;Sherlock&#34; included the original in the series.  Nice light, fun readying between bouts of Dostoyesky and Extistentual Psychology.  Thanks Amazon!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. It was amazing to read and I could feel everything that happened. I loved how Katniss was so brave and I would recommend this book to anyone who asked for a recommendation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very spell binding story.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Never would have guessed how it ended.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was a very good movie. I have a habit of falling asleep when I watch movies. Not with this movie. It was fast pace, it makes you feel like your part of the movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the story and the movie.  Had both on my Kindle Fire and couldn't quit on either until I had gotten to the end.  I had started reading the book before leaving on a weekend trip by car.  I found myself stopping at truck stops and restaurants along the way just to read a few more chapters.  Great!!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Enjoy all games where I have to match groups of objects;  especially when it involves matching colors or shapes or combinations of numbers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was not my type of book.  I was told to get past the first parts of filth and it would be a great story.  Just couldn't do it.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS SHOW!?<br />I'm too obsessed. It gets better and better with every season.<br />Nathan and Stana are perfection. (:
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't think this is appropriate reading for &#34;children&#34; as it seems to be touted. Teens, absolutely -I would say a mature 13year old at the very youngest. Personally I think it's best suited for 14yrs and up because of the dark overtones woven intothe book (and I'm not referring to the WW2 aspect). For parents on the fence about its age appropriateness for younger readers  I suggest reading it first-you know your child. You will LOVE it. It's stunning on every level. I would give it 100 stars if I could!! A very (very!) dark comedy on some levels, it is above all a story about overcoming horrendous odds and the strength of the human spirit. It's not really a feel good book, though it has its moments. It's hard to really classify so I'll just say that I loved it and I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed and certainly DONT be put off,  if you're an adult, by the classification of this as a book for young<br />readers. It's a book that you won't want to put down!!!
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love comedy! Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds are two of my favorite actors. The storyline was fantastic! Their acting was outstanding! Would recommend to family and friends. =)
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Beautifully complex writing style. How easily life's events can take you to the unknown... Both good and evil<br />Thrilling adventure
B000OBYLVO|5.0|This movie was not only funny, but entertaining. The cast was fantastic in each of their assigned roles. I would recommend to friends & family alike. =)
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The graphics on this game are as good as I have seen on games much more expensive. Great gaming experience.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Yes there is no casting. I would actually rate it 4.5/5. But then, sometimes I know I'm in stalemate (or 99% sure) and it says h<br />The game is still on.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story is very interesting and imaginative! My only critique is that the writing style was often-- I'll say juvenile, for lack of a better word. Overly explanatory, young in mentality. Much in the way Twilight was interesting storywise but I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say worth the read. It would be a great movie or mini-series!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app but some times it won't let me whach my farvet videos and I have to post a lot of funny videos on edmodo my class page so people will have a lafech
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|What an amazing app.<br />An awesome mixer, use it to have fun, entertains millions, prob one of the best music apps out there. It helps if you have some songs of yours for you to mix<br />Some minor glitches, the flanger thing totally disrupts the music, and the scratching can sound out of place.also the store won't open.
0307352153|5.0|The author did not merely argue for the sensibleness of introversion, but back up her arguments with support from scientific experiments.
B00000IBVC|5.0|The best opera played at the original site it was meant to have taken place. The performances are fantastic. I loved every moment of it and especially the &#34;Bamboo songs&#34; are just exemplary.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Played this way back when it was very limited on both vehicles and course choices, had buckets of money and nothing to do with it, got bored... SO happy they they have decided to continue updating. I've seen several updates in less than a year now and I'm happily playing again. Better than expected and more fun than any of the other &quot;lower tech&quot; freebie games. Hours of mindless fun!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Really fun really addictive. Since I got the game haven't put it down. Would recommend for all ages. Thank you guys.
0345803507|5.0|Great series of books. All I needed was the last book and I found it here for a great price.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. The mechanics are quick to learn, and there are different special plays to use on difficult levels. Definitely worth a play.
B00G3P6VA4|5.0|This is a great movie. It is best enjoyed when not focusing on it flaws, but focusing on the little story that is told. I'll admit that during the movie i did have some bad thoughts, but it is best to just shut up and enjoy the movie! Probably one of my favorite movies to come out in 2013.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|This was a good movie however, I don't feel it was epic. I enjoyed it and if you like Quentin Tarantino then I suggest it.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|This movie provides a fair opportunity to look at one of the possible scenarios of our future. As the current socioeconomic trends indicate the devide between super rich and poor will eventually establish a feudal type segregated relationship so brilliantly captured by director. The movie clearly defines how a class warfare would look like if super rich gain an absolute control. Just like I enjoyed a new version of Total Recall, I enjoy this exellent production. Cant wait to add it to my library.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|It was a really good movie however, I don't think it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, so it gets four stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Having a blast with the minions :-)<br />Definitely worth checking out and it's free to boot! Also good clean fun for kids...not just adults
B001P36OY2|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible, really disappointed in Vin Diesel for this movie. His performance in this movie was also mediocre at best.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|the book is somewhat a slow reader and I had to push through a lot of the time but I am glad I did.
6305428050|4.0|This is a classic and I love watching it. Vincent D'onofrio was great as the mechanic/Thor in this film, brings back childhood memories.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great film - thoughtfully and skillfuly put together and thoroughly enjoyable.  After seeing this documentary I immediately searched for copies to give as gifts.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends was classic sitcom, and after the series finally sitcoms died out to crappy reality television, or I as I call it trash t.v. I love to watch this over with my wife because it is her favorite show of all time.
B001UFQNF0|5.0|It it very detailed and has good sound effects and lights, but it may be too big to play with. Still, it is a good to display, and I reccommend for any Back to the Future fans.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|I got this for me and my father. this one is great one to get if you like rush albums from 1989-2007.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app is awesome. I got it on my kindle Fire HD, so my brother played Monsters University, &amp; he paused it at funny parts<br />. When we were done my brother would use this app &amp; change the effects on the picture to make it look funny.
B0085BHHOS|5.0|i enjoy her hits and b sides. this one is a great one to get if you like both .
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A few hunts in and I am already getting hook. Good gameplay and good graphics.<br />Looking forward to what the next hunt brings!
B009AJDET6|5.0|I enjoy there albums and my mom and dad had these one on LP and i am glad to get them on CD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This puzzle game is simply fun and relaxing. The first few sets are really easy and once your up to 8x8 it starts getting increasingly more challenging. Well thought out and easy to play, this game is great if you only have 5 spare minutes or an hour to enjoy at you leisure. I'm a huge puzzle solving fan and this game hit Mark!
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|I enjoy there past tours on DVD and this one is a great one to get if you like there power windows album stuff and there new album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Very addictive!  Wonderful that you can play it anywhere on many different devices. Number 1 on my playlist.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I enjoyed her stuff and she is still great to get. this is for any fan of her music and albums.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Enterprise really presents humanity as a flawed creature.  TNG, Voyager, and DS9 all show humanity and an entity called &#34;The Federation&#34; as the perfect, ideal society, and they have the only real values in the universe.  Enterprise brings a humanity I can relate to into the picture, and I find I can connect with the characters on a more personal level.  If you are tired of the typical &#34;high and mighty&#34; Federation and the starship captains and crews being &#34;the best society has to offer&#34;, (because I will tell you... they can can be very hard to connect with, as I am the first to say that I do not fit Star Trek's description as &#34;Earth's finest&#34;) then watch Enterprise.  You will be refreshed.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|I got this one for my father and i wanted to get for me. this is a great one to get if you like there music.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|First of all I love this band,and honestly I've got to say this is a very powerful CD,they really did it.It was in good condition and arrived on time.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I got this after i saw it with my Father and it was a great movie and a great one to get.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I'm completely addicted but I wish the extras didn't cost so much and its hard to earn gold to buy them in the first place...why can't more &quot;free&quot; apps just be that? FREE!
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|I enjoyed her single from her new album and it was great. this is for any fan of her stuff.
1401235417|5.0|Great story by a great writer. There is a reason why this has been so popular. Looking forward to reading the next instalment.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I enjoyed there songs and my mom love them to. this is a great one to get if you like there hits.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|What's the big deal, other than the fact that the app allows me to shoot video in 1080p HD? The Kindle Fire HD already has a camera for taking pictures. The app doesn't have a flash like the regular camera. Video resolution is great, but in low-light situations the video is very grainy and dark. Panaroma mode is good, kinda hard to frame a shot, but neat. Not impressed.
B000A88F22|5.0|I enjoyed the home made videos of there lives and this is a great one to get if you like a inside look in there wedding prep.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't get enough of this game. Don't have Facebook but have gmail. Would love to have more friends. Scrpn282@gmail.com ... RJ
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I'm digging it and it gives you tons of free shot for the console games . If you play injustice gods among us this is the way to go
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Alright I usually don't like game like this but this one I really like I mean it's so much fun! It's just fun to build a faction and build your military base battle other players I just love it
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Terraria is extremely fun but I wish they would update if faster and sooner. Would have been five starts if not for the update problem.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|Tangled is such a great movie! It is so fun to watch, and keeps you laughing from beginning to end!!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Said no one ever. It is an exciting game featuring favourite superhero the Green Lantern. Also contains such hits as Barman, Logo, and Sinestro. Buy this game.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|You are the best for me and I been wanting you to come to my birthday but you did not show up and it was on Thursday  and I lead for you to come to it
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was very well-written with plenty of surprises.  It has some depressing moments but they are necessary for the character development of this story.  There is a delicate mix of good and not-so-good...Stephen King recommended this book...who can argue with that endorsement?!
B00946ZOT8|5.0|My daughter will be so surprised at Christmas when she opens it up she is such a Twilight Saga fan there will be one wall with all the Twilight on it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Years ago I enjoyed the &amp;#34;King 's Quest&amp;#34; series.  This game is of the,same genre with improved graphics and animation.  Keep them coming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good update but I found a small cavern,they added caves ! I love minecraft,the creeper the zombies and the Skelton! GREAT GAME AND GREAT JOB MOJANG
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most wonderful game for kids and is super fun I need a couple more Christmas tree to win the super prize
B00ENXBUR2|4.0|It looks pretty awesome displayed next to my other Superman stuff, only thing I don't like is that this was made in China and not America (no wonder we're still in debt with them). Anyways, its a pretty cool product, looks awesome, feels pretty smooth, love how it shines in my room. The features on this Blu-Ray are beyond amazing. Besides that, this movie is a must have. The retelling of Superman at one of its greatest. Can't wait to see what kind of Collector's Edition Superman/Batman will have a few years from now!<br />Amazon is the best!
B003O86FMW|4.0|My kind of story.  Creative and imaginative combined with action and adventure.  I am so glad I read it before seeing the movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|my son loves this game I always beat him on multiplayer mode, this game is like the free version but better, I think it's worth 99 cents
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|I've always been a fan of Alan Jackson and have most of his albums. For the past  twelve years I've become more of a bluegrass fan, going so far as to playing bluegrass guitar.  I've listened to all the  greats, and though this isn't the &#34;High Lonesome &#34; style<br />of much of the bluegrass,  it is really Alan Jackson style bluegrass, as smooth as Larry Sparks. The album has a nice flow and it was easy for me to identify the songs Alan wrote, eight of the fourteen.  After listening to the album several times and especially the first track, Long Hard Road, I hope Alan is sending a message to his fans... that being that he is returning to our roots as a nation, mountain music.  Todays country music for the most part has changed drastically and not for the better. If Alan chooses to continue<br />down this long hard road he will no doubt have continued success,  especially when choosing to surround himself with those who<br />provided the outstanding accompaniment on this, his first offering. This album was worth the fifteen years he and  I've waited for.
0142501123|5.0|This is a really fun book to read to your child. The rhymes are fun and inventive, and the story is good, too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The best thing about The Racketeer was being kept in the dark about what was really going until the end. Unfortunately the story dragged in parts because of the same reason. Otherwise a good read and unusual plot.
B0026Q8F6C|5.0|Absolutely love this film.  Funny when it released in the 90's and still funny today.  I can't stand musicals, but I know every song from this film by heart.  If you like South Park then there is no reason to not watch this film.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series has never been what one could call dull, but not since Storm of Swords have I been so enthralled by an entry into this epic series. Though I was worried that the trip back in time would rob certain characters of plot resolutions to the threads began in A Feast for Crows, not only does Martin provide these resolutions, but he somehow managed to raise the stakes forall other characters as well. Although sometimes predictable, the story he lays down here will keep you invested, wondering, and screaming both in delight and in horror. Dance of Dragons  is easily my favorite entry into the series to date!
1451666179|5.0|She is the funniest writer AND illustrator of all time as far as I'm concerned. The story about cake is the best.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I was at he premiere for this film when the filmmakers had received threats from monsanto execs for screening the film. If you make corrupt companies angry, you are doing something right
B00BD99JMW|4.0|this book was,as all the others, amazing ad well written. but as i said this is a spoiler alert so stop reading if you havent read it yet.  tris dies. i was shocked when my friend told me and i need to see proof for myself.  also i liked the different perspectives thing. i did always wonder what<br />Tobias' pov would be like.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|I actually stopped watching this movie about 3/4 of the way through it. I was just too bored with it. There is no story told here, no humanity to explore. It is just a battle between gods which could have been about as well played out on the moon as upon earth. The humans were incidental. Gone are the rich character interactions one expects from the Superman legend. The beauty of &#34;Superman&#34; is in how the people of Earth interact with him, how our daily existence plays off the rich tapestry provided by his existence among us. We got mere glimpses of that at best, moments (seconds here and there really) of it amidst what was basically a Krypton war fought on an Earth battleground. Yes, great special effects (yawn). These days those are much easier to produce than a good story.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Provocative and challenging. I like the concept of things that benefit from volatility (including to some degree our children). Preachy at times and longer than it needed to be
159184617X|5.0|Although I have not yet finished the book, everything so far has been amazing! The book is written beautifully. I have loved every word so far.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It reads like a dark fairytale. The pacing is simple and quick, but the depth of the story seems deeper than Lettie Hempstock's ocean.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this twice when it came out in the theaters. It played for months at the independent cinema in Albany, NY. I've watched it everyday since I got it. It's based on a true story of a mission to smuggle six Americans out of Iran during the embassy hostage crisis. It deserved best picture last year. This is a very, very good movie.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This CD plays non-stop in my car.  I can't imagine that Feliz Navidad could sound better than the original, but Il Volo gave it their Midas touch and it's just beautiful.  Love these boys....can't get enough of Piero's voice.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This a grown-up feel good movie. It is a story of profound friendship across race and class. It's based on a true story of a wealthy French invalid and the man he hires to be his caretaker. They develop a deep and lasting friendship that transcends their differences. I saw this when it came out, and it still makes me happy when I watch it. A truly great film.
0062225790|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"I became a secret reader.  In the holidays from boarding school, I would sneak up to my bedroom with a book: a guilty truant from the fresh air and the virtuous outdoors.  And when I started learning biology properly at school, it was still bookish pursuits that held me.  I was drawn to questions that grown-ups would have called philosophical.  What is the meaning of life?  Why are we here?  How did it all start?\\"<br /><br />The above comes from this tell-all memoir from the author of such best-sellers as \\"The Selfish Gene\\" (1976), \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" (1986), \\"The God Delusion\\" (2006), and \\"The Magic of Reality\\" (2011), RICHARD DAWKINS.  He is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature.  Dawkins has received numerous honours and awards especially in science.  He retired from his position as Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University in 2008.<br /><br />In 2012, a new genus name called \\"Dawkinsia\\" was created in recognition of his contribution to the public understanding of evolutionary science.  In 2013, Dawkins was voted the world's top thinker in \\"Prospect\\" magazine's poll (of 10,000 readers from over 100 countries).<br /><br />This book is actually the first book in his two-part memoir.  (The second book will be released sometime in 2015).  As Dawkins tells us:<br /><br />\\"Publication of 'The Selfish Gene' [in 1976] marks the end of the first half of my life.\\"<br /><br />In this first book, Dawkins tells us everything from his birth in Africa in 1941, his parents, and he even delves a bit into his family tree.  Then he moved to England when he was eight.  We learn of his early school and family experiences.  After this he went to Oxford University in 1959 where many positive influences on his life occurred.  This first book, as already mentioned, culminates with the publication of \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" thought by many to be one of the most important books of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Along the way, Dawkins tells us his views on such things as religion, critical thinking, how he was entranced with computers, his regrets, etc.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the last two chapters of this book.  The penultimate chapter deals with the phenomenal \\"The Selfish Gene\\" while the final chapter, amongst other things, is a tribute to Charles Darwin, Dawkins' \\"greatest scientific hero.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there are three sets of glossy photographs in this book (some in colour, some in black and white).  I found that these enhanced the main narrative.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the first in a two-set autobiography by one of the greatest minds of our time: Clinton Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />(first published 2013;  15 chapters;  main narrative 295 pages;  acknowledgements;  text and picture acknowledgements;  index;  about the author)<br /><br />XXXXX/>Along the way, Dawkins tells us his views on such things as religion, critical thinking, how he was entranced with computers, his regrets, etc.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the last two chapters of this book.

B007PVHANM|5.0|I never paid much attention to Bob Marley while he was alive. I went to see this movie and sat through the whole thing thinking &#34;I really missed the boat on this guy.&#34;  You don't have to be a Marley fan to appreciate this movie. He was described in the film as a &#34;beautiful spirit.&#34; It's difficult to overstate how important he was in his native Jamaica, and the impact of his message and music on the development of a sense of national identity.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I owned one already and loved it because of the hard case ,the strap to keep it closed ,and the stand up functions ,so I ordered one for my friend and they love it also.
B00BATG18K|4.0|Amy Tam makes you feel that you are right there in the story.  I have enjoyed all of her books.  I enjoy reading about the culture of China.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Don't like the control they have instead of me. It took me too long to figure out how to sign back off.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I really like them!  For me being 66 years old!  Western,<br />but with modern rock and roll.  The lead singers both<br />have excellent voices and sound good alone too.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This movie was hilareous I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time.  Would recommend to everyone.  There are a few questable scenes so it's not for small one.
0515142247|5.0|I'm hooked on Jack Reacher.  I've read practically all of<br />his series.  Lee Child never disappoints you.  The suspence<br />and the outcome always surprises you; but Jack if the<br />same ole down to earth guy with a human heart.
0307454541|5.0|I started this with some trepidation - it is not my normal reading. After a chapter or two, when I got things sorted, I couldn't put it down. I bought the two sequels as a result and enjoyed all of the series. I felt that the ending of the third  was a little rushed - but hey, the chap was dying. Well constructed main characters and plot - devious and intricate.
0064431789|5.0|A simple as this book is, there is more to explore in every reading. The art is fantastic and the story is enjoyable. My little ones at home enjoy it almost as much as my first grade class does.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was like spending time with old friends. Very enjoyable read. Would recommend this book highly. keep them coming Mr. Gresham.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|it was a good movie addtion to our collection and was a great movie too boot.we all loved it alot
B009EELBIS|5.0|A true classic. One of my all-time favorites. Julia Andrews is such a large part of my childhood. My mom shared this movie with me when I was a little girl and I still get a smile on my face each and every time I watch it. I can't wait to share this movie with my own children.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I have never wanted a book to keep going and last forever so badly. Thank you, dear sugar, thank you.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I enjoyed the book. But not enough to give it any more than 3 stars. I felt like the book was rather predictable and I was very disappointed by the ending. It's a quick read and interesting enough, but again, the ending ruined the entire book for me.
630179513X|3.0|Bought it used to save money. The I and II were fine, but III was skippy in places. Quite disappointing. Will never buy used DVD's again!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Good game but do not like the fact that you have to pay or invite friends to get more levels
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was one of the more enjoyable series I've read.  I found the society concept to be fascinating, and the characters believable and well developed.  It was a series I would have loved to continue reading.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Action filled especially breathtaking in Blue Ray. Much better than regular DVD especially if you have a great LED Screen.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not my favorite series. After seeing the movies had to see how it  ends. It was Predictable. Was.noted to finish the series because of all the publicity
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss paints his world in simple, elegant prose. There is not a moment of boredom throughout the story. An excellent read!
B001L83PLQ|4.0|I like how the characters are flushed  out.  It's a story I have not heard in on such detail on a day to day basis, how their moods change and reflect in their behaviors.  I feel as though I am right there listening to the conversations with my ear to the door as Ugbu does.  I can smell the rice cooking and feel the tension between the motherinlaw and the rest of the household.  The characters are filled with flaws, human flaws as we all are.  I would recommend this book.
B000YDE46Y|4.0|People complained about the boot not fitting as expected....boots are supposed to be a bit big to provide room for your feet to expand into as they swell up or for the thick socks you're supposed to wear with them.  For hiking boots I usually get a size or two larger. Timberland probably anticipated this and adjusted for peoples actual shoe size and made them a tad bigger. Props to them.<br /><br />Price was fair compared to other boots of similar quality.<br />The color is great for versatile use (burnished brown).  The only issue I have is that the boots are already scuffing the  &#34;worn-in&#34; look which isn't a big deal, but a minor annoyance.<br /><br />The amount of stitched components give it a busy sort of look.<br /><br />This can be worn loosely (the most comfortable) or lace-up (ankle support).<br /><br />The treads on there boots were one of the reasons I chose it in my final decision.  They don't seem to be too worn for about 2 weeks of use but we'll see.<br /><br />Still too soon to talk about the actual durability of it but so far they're fantastic for any day.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Interesting but sad movie that is a little to close to home. Shows how human we all are in the best and worst of times.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I bought this because the cover intrigued me, it had lots of great reviews and happened to be on sale. Great find and great read! No wonder Cheryl has so many fans.<br /><br />She has a rich writing style and is totally unafraid to bare her soul and show you what it's made of, warts and all. Sometimes self-deprecating, occasionally hilarious, often no-holds-barred raw and painful, this book details Cheryl's process of self-discovery and healing as she prepares and hikes 1100+ miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. Alone! She goes in-depth into her greatest fears, personal trials and lowest points before the healing begins. I felt every blister and blackened toenail, and groaned with her (from the comfort of my sofa) as well as celebrated her milestones. Awesome and inspiring! (I'd love to see a picture of Monster (her backpack and constant companion) and hear about how much that thing actually weighed!)
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read as always.....slow getting started, but picked up the action...I couldn't put it down until I knew how it ended.
B0083Z614S|3.0|I loved this story and for  most of the book I thought I would heartily  recommend it but then the author began her anti GOD and humanist philosophies and THAT absolutely spoiled a thus far wonderful story.  Instead of giving God praise for HIS healing power and mercy and loving care it talked of \\"magic\\" and children wbo occultishly seem to trust in a. child's memories of what?  Witchcraft?  Instead of prayers of faith they chanted and believed in some thing called magic.  The book got very weird.  It teaches a newness and transformation without God.  An awaking with out God. And of  Colin's child faith he would \\"live FOREVER\\" which I am sure meant only a \\"normal\\"  life.  The book taught it is fine to call God's healing grace and wondrous working magic and Almighty God the \\"joy maker\\" or whatever name you choose.  This author must. be a Buddhist and believe in universal \\"forces\\" .  It is i. No way a wholesome  Christian book.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A beautiful movie, not to mention the message it brings!  Although it's fantasy, a lot of the message is true about how we treat Mother Earth!
B004BSFC46|3.0|I read the reviews and was nervous at first because I was not sure if they would fit my nephews' wrists and I did not know if they would rattle loud enough. When I received them, I was impressed that they not only easily fit both of my nephews' wrists (who are 2 and 3 months old), but they even fit my own! Of course, they just barely fit. There was some Velcro left over, which was slightly scratchy, so if for some reason a little was showing for the baby, I would have to keep that into consideration.<br /><br />The rattling, on the other hand, was not what I expected. One of them rattled, but it was considerably quiet. The other did not even rattle! It was the type of toy you squish and it makes crunching noises, which was actually probably more entertaining than the rattle. The babies did not seem to notice them yet, but they may be too young for that still.<br /><br />One other note, I remember reading a review that said their older child seemed more entertained by it than their baby. Boy was that the case in this scenario! My two year old nephew wanted to have them for himself! We had to bargain with him to let the baby have them. Even then, he'd soon be trying to grab them off the baby again! So, keep that in mind if there will be an older sibling in the house!
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|Great book to read, food to the mind. I am so grateful to learn so much from this book. I am bless. Thank you Mr. Murphy!
B003F48E4W|5.0|A classic of the generation. Keifer Sutherland and the Coreys, plus the haunted hip girl predestined for despair-- you can't go wrong!
B00A757EFW|2.0|I wanted the full game version, not the lite, however I have ordered and received the correct version of the game and play it often.
B00DW0TFP6|5.0|First off, the album is great. A7X came through again and produced a spectacular compilation of music. Also, the vinyl itself is spectacular. Who ever was in charge of mastering the album did a spectacular job as it is one of the clearest and pure sounding records I have ever played.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great game.it was free and we liked the game.we upgraded to the deluxe version and are equally satisfied.if you like puzzles,you will like this game.
B00631HASU|5.0|I lost a lot of time playing Zuma!  Now this!  I just love my Kindle Fire and Amazon.  I can't get over all the great apps.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|great fun.if you like puzzles,you will love this game.there are many games to choose from.if you like pyzzles,you will love this game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as much as the first one about Jake the lawyer.  it's an easy read but one that captured me from start to end.  if you like history of the old south, you will enjoy this one.
0062200909|5.0|First off, I did not purchase this book on Amazon.<br />Secondly, this is an amazing book with the cover itself. The detail in the cover, allows it to be a great coffee table book or conversation starter. Thirdly, the content of the book is amazing because it gives an in depth look at the making of the art and design of the film &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34;. I purchased the book after I had seen the film and it allows your mind to go back through the film of what you've already seen and see how the created the world in which this film takes place, Middle Earth.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Great book it has great new characters and good plot twists. Jack Jr gets developed nicely and becomes well rounded
B0043M4OTE|4.0|If you enjoy the Nightrunner series, then you will likely enjoy this collection that sheds some light on these familiar characters before some of them arrived at their current station in life.<br /><br />With luck, at some point a revised edition will come out, replacing the Casket of Souls excerpt with another short story or three.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|GRRM is an extremely gifted writer.  I love reading his GOT books.  Read all five and I'm waiting very patiently for books 6 and 7.  I catch myself in awe of his use of analogies.  Extremely witty.  He'll make you think and ponder, laugh and grief.
B00C4Y4434|2.0|My 7 years old daughter is crazy about MH dolls.  So when most of them went on sale here. ..I was excited and grabbed a couple for her this Christmas. Despite the low prices,  all said the condition are new.  I gave it a two stars because of the condition it came in. There were so many scratches and imperfections  on her. Her hair looked like it would look like after a few days my daughter would play with it.  I had purchased this doll and about 12-13 other monster high dolls from amazon for my daughter for Christmas. . . I would say about half of them came with imperfections...!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So hard to really get into. But then it grips you, mind and heart, so you can't put it down. The pounding heart and warm tears receive the end of this story. Very unusual and so thought provoking. Please read.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great series.  Good sci-fi, good cast, great story line.  We loved the original and this spin-off takes it to a new level.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is one that I have intended to read for some time, but just never got around to it. I must say, it was worth the wait.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fffggtffffgbdns hand jelly the same way that you have any idea of a. Hdhxjxnxjxjx to the first place of swords to a report from this point I am looking to get to know about you and the lost ark to get a
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this was a very quick and easy read. can't wait to read the next two books. I definitely recommend this book
0694003611|5.0|My husband and I love this book. I bought this one for a friend's shower. Every child should have this read to them often as they drift off to sleep.
B0007TKNII|4.0|It's always hard to take something people are used to seeing on stage and put it on the screen. But this is a great version of The Phantom of the Opera. They stayed very true to the stage production yet in a few instances were better able to explain what was going on since they weren't limited by the stage.
055380684X|4.0|Although I haven't finished it, I am really interested in sharing what I am learning from it with my friends and colleagues. I am a teacher and am hoping that it gives me some fresh ideas on reaching kids in the classroom that might otherwise be content to be mediocre.
B001JIES4Q|5.0|This movie has become part of my holiday traditions.  I love it.  It's definitely worth watching.  If you saw &#34;About Time&#34; in theaters, then you'll like this one as well.
B00C061HZY|5.0|awesome vinyl. great sounds, not too many fillers and great cover! Would recommend for any vinyl purchaser! get it while on sale!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Here's a breakdown of the game: they put several animals right in front of you and you have to shoot one. Once your gun isn't tough enough to kill them, you're supposed to buy coins to make your guns better. There really isn't any sort of challenge.<br /><br />It has good graphics for a tablet game but with a poor game setup...it has potential, but they didn't quite succeed. I honestly think the only reason why it has so many good reviews is because they want you to rate it so early on.
0740748475|5.0|this is the perfect gift! My friend enjoyed this very much and was very nostalgic. The whole box set is very well done and ascetically pleasing. I very much recommend this!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like always Grisham never disappoints. Amazing story from beginning to end and cleverly developed throughout the book. Awaiting the next book already
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.<br />Would love to see where the future takes them in another book.<br />Funny and hot.<br />Good read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Full of the utmost extremes of comedy, and sadness, coinciding with a deep powerful meaning everyone who reads this stupendous work of literature wishes to explore. I could not recommend anything else more.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Okay, who doesn't like classic Marvin Gaye!  This album, with its haunting rhythms, poignant social messages, coupled with Marvin Gaye's souful vocals, you can't go wrong.  If you don't have this Marvin Gaye cd in your music collection, get it!  You won't regret it.  Love Marvin Gaye!
B002UEW31I|1.0|A cartoon.  Do I believe that a group of Americans can run around occupied France and Germany making all that noise and not get caught?  No.  But ok, this is a revenge flick rather than any real desire to explore evil or antisemitism.  Made by a coward.  (Sigh.)<br /><br />But more than that it is a love decapitation to violence and malice.  So if you love serial killers, malice, revenge, pain, blood - pathology, well, let me be as far away from you as possible.  More and more, we resemble the Romans in the colesium.<br /><br />It sickens me.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|This is great music, for those who love accapella music. beatiful music, great christmas favorites. I would suggest it to any one.
0767812387|5.0|If you liked Dirty Dancing and other dance movies you'll love this one.  All the dancers were great!<br />I love  Kris Kristofferson... woohoo!!
0525953728|5.0|Great book. Read it. I have bought several and given them to friends. You should too. Not just another SEAL book,
B001N4OX82|5.0|A good reflection of a movie viewed when it first came out. A lot of historically important aspects that wasn't grasped the first time. I recommend browsing through the film to pick up missed cues.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I thought this was a great start to the series and readers should be quite impressed with Rice's unique fantasy world.
B001V7SME2|5.0|Just like the cover says, &#34;The best vampire movie Ever!&#34; As a horror/suspense writer myself, I found it refreshingly different from the &#34;Twilight&#34; Series. This movie was also much closer to the original book since the screenplay was written by that author, John Ajvide Lindqvist. The American/British movie production, &#34;Let Me In&#34; was also a Great version. By necessity however, it had to be &#34;Toned Down&#34; for American audiences who might see some parts of LTROI as bordering on child porn. In both movies, the young stars really made the storyline reach out and touch the audience on a deeply emotional level. Especially with Bullying being so much in the news these days.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|This book is an amazing classic.  Siddhartha' journey taught me so much.  This is one if my favorite books, and I highly recommend it
0761169253|5.0|Nice gift book for yourself (if you're in need of creative encouragement at times) or for someone you know who could benefit from same.  I keep it on my desk and randomly open it and read when I hear the nagging voice of doubt and it helps.  The format is easy to approach with advice delivered with a sense of humor.  Ten simple things are addressed to help you take a deep breath and forge ahead with whatever you'd like to accomplish.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This has been my favorite book since I was a child.  I feel it is one of the best books ever written.
B0010HA68I|3.0|Good way to add binoculars to the Optech strap, but the upper attachments are flimsy, not good for a heavy DSLR
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Nice App! Only complaint is the directions popping so big in the middle of the screen, other than that AWESOME!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Having a good time with this game! Way better then the original version. I play it all the time. Lots of fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only downside is having to depend on other people to advance in the game. Also it needs to be compatible with my Nokia Lumina920
B00DYEBM2Y|2.0|Although the music for this album is great the record is not.<br /><br />First lets get to the music. It sounds like Mazzy Star never left and just wrote these songs and began singing again. The songs are good with some memorable ones. In The Kingdom, I've Gotta Stop and Lay Myself Down are my favorites. The rest of the album plays out pretty well too with maybe one track that may not be the greatest. Overall a 4 out of 5 for the music.<br /><br />However, and this is for the vinyl record collectors. The manufacturer of the vinyl record seriously dropped the bomb when making this record. The quality is so poor it is unlistenable, Record number 1 is completely trashed and sounds like listening to a garbage dispenser. If the record was any cheaper I would throw it out. Record number 2 is slightly better. Tons of hisses and pops but at least its better than record #1.<br /><br />All in all, great music, garbage quality vinyl record. Thank goodness it came with a download or I would have been out of a decent amount of money.
1611137527|5.0|I have the book on CD, which I have loaded into my iPod for my morning walks.  Malcom Gladwell keeps it interesting and gives me lots of think about.  I enjoy his writings....
0062107313|3.0|I love Amy Tan...but I did not like this book, “The Valley of Amazement”.  I felt it simply was not up to par with her previous work.  I have read all of the books published by Amy Tan, and have always found her work captivating and intriguing.  Although, I was very disappointed in this book, I look forward to new books released by Amy Tan that will surpass her stimulating novels that I have previously enjoyed!
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Would have preferred more Pendergast and less Corrie.  Thoroughly enjoy Special Agent Pendergast and all his exploits but tired of Corrie's stupidity.  Can only hope that she will mature if she is a regular character in future Pendergast stories.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Amazing story.  Read it for a book club and loved it.  It's a touching story about a horrible time in our history.  The love of the characters in this novel will draw you in.  It makes you realize how lucky we are to be born in this day and age rather than 100 years ago-especially as a woman.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|During the 1990s and earl 2000s, my startup &#34;partnered with&#34; Amazon. Meaning that, like all partners, I also competed with them. On three occasions, they attempted to buy my business. I interacted withe the company regularly, helped them launch several important innovations, and interacted over a decade plus with many of the characters mentioned in the book, including Bezos.<br /><br />I admire Amazon enormously. And I recommend against competing with them. Brad Stone captures the complexity of Amazon, (although I take Andy Jassy's  one star comments seriously, alongside those of other Amazon employees).<br /><br />Every great company and every great entrepreneur is a complicated story. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison are both mercenary and missionary. Indeed they cannot imagine one without the other. (As Stone points out, all three are also adopted -- a topic for another book).<br /><br />There is a lot to admire in successful companies, and Stone gives Amazon a lot of credit for being persistent, visionary, and relentless There is also plenty to fear -- and Stone does not shy away from pointing this out. He may have some of the details wrong, but I think that the picture he paints and the skill he shows in telling it make this a really compelling read.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Please see my review for &#34;Before Sunset&#34;
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have played Jumbline 1 &amp; 2 for a long time. I recently tried this game. None of them have locked up, the graphics are nice and the games are smooth and nice looking. I highly recommend any games by Brainium. :-)
B0002YLC24|5.0|I like all of this series.  Most people I know don't.  Try one before you buy all four.  If you like Woody Allen you probably will like these.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Probably could have been less long-winded in the story, but the puzzles and hidden objects were entertaining. Gives closure to part 1. I was expecting the last chapter to be longer and not so simple.
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|If you liked &#34;My Dinner with Andre&#34; or &#34;The Late Quartet&#34; you might like this series.  It's all dialog, what you hear is what you get.  Each movie is a masterpiece.  Together they are amazing.
B00464AVXW|5.0|I had been wanting to see this movie for years, having heard how disturbing it was, etc. I had always been cautioned by my wife that I MUST NOT see this terrible movie. How horrific it was, how terrible. Not a terrible movie, mind you, just a terrible circumstance. Well, one should never say those kinds of things to me. Finally, I saw it all by myself in my little study and what do you know, loved it. One hell of a good detective story. One hell of a good horror movie. One hell of a story.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Me and my kids really enjoy this game. My kids love to take care of him, feed him, and play the games on this app. Lots of fun!!!
B006FTCH2E|5.0|Great indie movie. Not as polished as a big Hollywood budgeted SF flick, of course, the movie tells a human story and poses a What If...? Scenario that is unique enough to hold the interest. The twist at the end makes it all worth it. I enjoyed this more than many Hollywood formulaic movies that are mainly trying to get your money first and tell a story second. This one is the other way around.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app works great, no fuss.  It's great to use when I want to set an alarm, but don't want to use my phone.  If I use my phone, then calls and texts would wake me, so this is the perfect solution.
B000FC1GJW|3.0|Unfortunately as you read this series, you will be less and less enchanted. The first book pretty much tops the charts. I mean, Golden Compass has such a unique life of its own that it just grabs you and takes hold. Which means you HAVE to do Subtle Knife and at first you go along for the ride, but notice something is missing. You won't be able to put your finger on it, but it's just not the same vibe. But, you will keep going because Golden Compass was soooo good. So, then once done with Subtle Knife, you have to find out how it ends and so...Amber Spyglass.<br /><br />I would say, too many disjointed and half thought out ideas in this book. There is enough to tug you along, but homosexual angels are probably not among them. Though honestly, I wouldn't have minded if the one angel hadn't been so...defeated and weak from the start.<br /><br />It's a hodge podge of religiosity and other elements that don't work all too well together. For instance, sentient ungulates with wheels on their feet. It just sort of gets corny at some points and I don't think it's supposed to.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Wonderful movie! It's a true Tarantino, blood and gore in just the right amount! It's clever, well written, and incredibly well acted.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|God, I love this movie. This is a remake of Death Takes a Holiday. The mood and tone struck and held between Hopkins and Pitt is stunning. The love story that unfolds is beautiful and the bond between Pitt and Hopkins becomes truly eternal. It's a slow burner, so don't watch when you're sleepy and don't watch it if you want action and guns. If the romantic in you is yearning for a touch of Gothic and a philosophic foray into the human heart, then sit back for an enchanting journey.
B00G21XNKU|4.0|Loved the 50th Anniversary Special! It really changed the series dramatically. It is going to kick off a great series of events in the coming seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun to play. It is addicting. I wish I could get more help sometime, but it usually works out.
B00BAXFACO|3.0|I found this book hard to get into, kept setting it aside and picking it up later to try again as I have always liked Michael Connelly's work. By the half-way mark I was hooked and enjoyed it to the end. Throughout I did find some of the storyline seemed awkward and disjointed, making it hard to care much about the main characters. I didn't feel this book measured up to previous writing.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded it, and every time I try to open it, it doesn't even load, it kicks me off! Don't download!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|LOVE PLAYING THE ANGRY BIRDS, SO SIMPLE, YET ADDICTIVE. PLAY IN THE EVENINGS WHEN I GO TO BED INSTEAD OF TV
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft soooo much! When it became available for Kindle Fire I started running around in circles and screaming! My Kindle does occasionally freeze while I'm playing Minecraft but I blame it on my device, not the app. The only thing I would change on it would be how you do multiplayer, because in the older version it was easier and now you have to do all this  complicated stuff, but other than that I would totally recommend this app!
B00GP0G0IK|1.0|It will not finish downloading no matter how long I let sit while it is downloading.  The indicater line barely moves. I have tried time and again and am only 1/8 of the download.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I just can't believe I hadn't read it until now. But a warning for those who are prone to FEEL a well-written story as if you are actually there experiencing it: it will take some recovery time when you finish it. In my opinion-- that's the sign of a true masterpiece.
B00499LTLM|5.0|One of the best shows of all time.  I only wish that the blu-ray would work on my blu-ray player.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Absolutely love the movie. Ever since I was a kid, I've been a huge Tolkien fan. While there were some differences in the movie from the book (like it is with many other book to movie adaptions), it was still an exciting movie to watch. It had action, it had drama, it had moments that made me tear up and laugh immediately right after. The extended scenes were fun to watch, and they added a little extra fun to the film.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I loved the characters and I loved their stories. It's too bad the author tried to hide them behind 500 pages of self indulgent philosophizing.
B00BATG18K|3.0|Very similar in content to Memoirs of a Geisha.  It also seemed inordinately long.  It could have easily either been condensed or made into 2 separate books.  While I am a fan of Amy Tan, this is not her best work.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Difficulty can be set, about what you would expect if you have played magic and a great way to learn if you haven't.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Well it has to many of the new littlest pet shop I like the old ones but I really love this game.buy it
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Wow, this game is exactly what I was searching for . . . something that is truly fun to play, that has some emotional depth, and a clear, universally spiritual experience. As a recent retiree I took up PS3 for some fun but was quickly disappointed with all the gore, guns and gangsters in most games. This one is truly one-of-a-king and refreshing. Simply to play and understand; a clear and coherent theme and relatively simple puzzles to solve. I love the way the helper appears when you need it. Very powerful with many links to the quest for meaning in life and our earthly trials; the game is replete with challenges, rewards, powerful guardians and even the the tunnel at the end so common in near-death experiences. Full of symbols. Fun to play. Everything I've been looking for.
B0055SWM08|5.0|If I could give this game six stars, I would.  It is just a great, great game,  a standard by which other gane developers can and will be judged.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excitement all the way through..keeps your attention throughout!  No lagging!  Would recommend this book and the seriies to all.  Hope to see more like this!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am surprised by how poorly written this book is given its popularity. I found nothing redeeming about the story or the characters. The main character is more vacuous than the heroine in traditional romance novels, and her dynamic with her lover is so superficial that the love scenes aren't even erotic. The back story seems to be provided for the sole purpose of moving the novel from one intimate encounter to another, yet these encounters lack the sexual tension required to make me want to read about more than one. The prose makes me wonder...has the author ever even had physical intimacy? If you're looking for a titillating semi-erotic piece, you would be better off reading any one of Anne Rice's vampire series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire:<br />Best one of the three!  Loved the trilogy though! Hoping Suzanne Collins will come up with more books like this!
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is a really great series intended to modernize and make relevant, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterful works. The scripts run from very good to great and Benedict Cumberbatch does a good job portraying the great detective. I do hope, however, that the writers will allow a little more emotion and understanding to come thru Cumberbatch's character, if for no other reason, his constant exposure to his friend and colleague, John Watson. There are some other aspects of the series I would &#34;fine tune&#34;, but, it's a British series, and they have their own way of doing things. The result is a very watchable and entertaining program; highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good and love the title, but the second book was probably the best in my opinion! Recommend it for reading
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Some small hiccups with pages you did not open, just popping up on your screen open. Overall ok and I would continue to use it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that they finally have this game for my kindle fire :) mmmm the only game to make me hate chocolate. lol lots and lots of fun during daily chores
B00FGJNS72|4.0|Good. There are some user friendly issues, especially when trying to use word and export stuff to the word document
B00C6B7GTE|5.0|It's the Dude and lots of ways to watch him. The movie is obviously great, and this is a good way to get your hands on the blu-ray if the price isn't much higher than other copies. I wouldn't recommend paying much extra for this copy over any other blu-ray though.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Very helpful and user friendly program. Also produced with safety in mind as it does not allow the driver to manipulate the program whilst driving, however a passenger could, thereby increasing road safety. One minor flaw though, it takes a bit longer to refresh, perhaps due to GPS issues.
B008602KQI|4.0|I had heard from friends that this was a good movie. Twenty-four kids set out to kill each other didn't seem like a good movie but the unexpected friendships that develop make the movie worthwhile.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I spent the time to read the instruction booklet, change a playlist of my songs on iTunes to a different format, load the songs on the Neptune, and try to properly fit it on my head.  The fit is OK, not great, but OK.  A swim cap would probably help them stay in place a little better.  However, the biggest problem was that after 3 songs water started to leak into the device and it started going crazy on me.  Finally it just died and you can see water behind the screen.  Now I have to go through the return process, and most likely spend my own money and time trying to return this POS.  I sure hope this is just a fluke, because the device has potential.
B008JFUORW|3.0|This movie was very dark. Was not like the other ones that had quit a bit of comedy in it. Was not surprised at the ending. Very disappointed
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I WENT FROM BEING SURE I WOULD NOT FINISH READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO BLEAK and  hopeless, but then I had to know if and how they made it.  It was a very intense but interesting read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|like watching funny flicks. help to take the stress away from some miserable days. Always good to have a laugh.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|One of the funniest things that I've read in years.  Not only that, beautifully written with a light but incisive touch.  And free to the reader on Kindle!
B008JFURII|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Lot of drama, but with a twist of comedy. would recommend it to any one. dose give a lot of action
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great game. Works awesome for me. You can pay to get farther but with my work schedule it times out great . My upgrades are ready when I get off work graphics are awesome and its free
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This will teach you Spanish ,  You must stay on point with this.  It is very much on point  it goes through spelling, speech, and reading in Spanish....
0823015017|4.0|Execelent for those who want take color theory, serously.  A littlle high brow for those who want just little help.  It is well organized, beautifully illustrated and has some nice projects.  Get it if you are into color and are clueless.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|We bought a handful of Bruder toys for our 3-year-old son's birthday. I was more than impressed with their detail and quality. They're fantastic toys that our son LOVES and plays with everyday. They're not as sturdy as the all-metal options from Tonka, but they may up for it in realism. I would suggest that if you kid tends toward rougher play, they might not be the best purchase. On arrival, I did think that they might be better for kids a little older than my son, but so far they've held up.<br /><br />(Admission: I love playing with these as much as my son does).
1455502758|5.0|This book was honest!  Sadly Christopher Hitchins chronicled the  last days of his life and offered a way to die with dignity .  Not a lot can be said about his demise except that he faced it with dignity and resolve.  Too bad he didn't live longer so that he could have continued to write and open people's minds.
B001NY4X4G|5.0|First time I saw Edward Norton who has now become one of my favorite current actors. Clever twist at the end...I have watched this movie several times and never get tired of it. The special features explain how Norton became the actor of choice which was an interesting story in itself!
0345803485|5.0|Where do I begin?  I've NEVER read a book like this, let alone a 3 book series.  Phenomenal!  Absolutely thrilling!!!
B000007ODY|5.0|Brahms is one of the &#34; Three Bs&#34; I was not familiar with, so what better way to start listening than via a Von Karajan-led collection?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the graphics in this game! This has quickly become my favorite game for the kindle. I love that there is no energy in this game. I do wish however that it didn't take long to make money
B004RZGUBM|2.0|The content of the collection is the same as any other, but there is no indexing when used on a Kindle, so it's hard to find a specific book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game. A good time waster and the harder difficulty takes some thought. Would be better of u could pinch to zoom out.
B007LGPMX6|3.0|It is not Amazon's fault, but the series look pretty blurry, due to age! But overall it is the complete series I used to love when I was younger.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am waiting patiently for the series to get started, I'm beaming with anticipation to see Christian on film. loved the spend of the story.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Rough stressful but I love it! The characters are amazing, good acting good story line. I have been really enjoying this series.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Denzel was the only saving grace. Not a story of a pilot but of a coverup. Would not recommend nor watch again.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is a great game with high replay value. It would be better with the story mode. Very good if you like DC universe
B000FA57US|5.0|Great movie and quality.  These movies are good for a scare without witnessing the blood and gore.  Gave the entire collection as gift.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like that it is challenging and that there are different tasks to do.  It is nice to play a free game but I get frustrated with waiting until I can play again.  The paid version looks like it could get expensive.  Some of the items are hard to find on a small screen I am playing on a Kindle Fire.
B004JVXTL8|5.0|This movie was great and very scary without the gore.  I love these types of movies and now I understand why they made so many of them.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Was a different concept and a pleasure to watch. Liked the idea of how they explained the magic being used.  Enjoyable for the whole family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book really enjoyed reading it.  Nice to see a wrong righted.  Page turner great start excellent ending!!  Would totally endorsed for a good read
B00GNL96H8|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this film.  We are not big fans of subtitles, but we thought it was very interesting and entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is fun but wish it would give you three lives instead of one.  Sometes your runs end up really short if you don't move fast enough.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good stuff. Didn't know if I was going to like it but it's good. I will definitely recommend it  to others.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is awesome the graphics are great you earn money fast and is super easy to use great to make the time go by when I'm bored
B00BTHV05M|2.0|Wife bought it. I'm not a fan of this king of music. More for teenage girls. I ran out or word for this
B00AALHW6Y|1.0|Very disappointed. The cd case is cracked and the plastic wrap was half way off the product. Even more disappointed that I have done this same review already and no one has responded about the product to make it right.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome, but I would love to go to the nether in P.E.WITHER<br /><br />ALSO TO GET THIS P.E LIKE P.C!!!
B009KY5OGC|5.0|This is a detailed work that every single person should read - and weep for our callous indifference to the proud traditions of all indigenous peoples, the world over.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That was flippen awesome. I loved this book. 10 out of 10!!! I recommend this book to like, literally everybody!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Hard work and I haven't managed to finish it. the detail is exhausting and the story moves ever so slowly along...
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was a quick read with several subplots.  It was a little predictable but other than that it's good reading candy.
0374531943|5.0|Really good if you want to know what it was like objectively as opposed to emotionally or spiritually.  Good information on how piloting and rendezvousing was accomplished during the nascent manned space program.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very thought prevoking subject that I never thought about before.  It made me a better  and more open- minded  person.  I'll never look at a wheelchair -bounded person the same way that I did before, nor will I judge a sucide as always wrong. ..
B00881VLCE|4.0|So far not hard to solve. Offers a choice of number of pieces to put together. Their is a nice offset of puzzles to choose from.  Will recommend to others.
0007248016|5.0|Listened to all 3 discs in one day. Mine came with a bonus Q and A disc. Not sure if they all do, in America, but this was an enjoyable listen. It doesn't even feel like he's reading, but telling you his life story.
0316055433|3.0|Highly hyped book, but I found it a bit long and wordy.  Managed to get through it by skimming a lot.  I did like the premise of the book and the characters, but just found the story about 1/3 too long.
1423136802|5.0|Best series ever.!!! Knowing that 5 amazing books for the price of one hardcover book it is awesome!! Recommended to anyone that loves mythology
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Favorite game of the century u have to get it now it is awesome and amazing.<br />U will go crazy over this game I know I am.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this  game but how o you update it I press update nothing happens I have tried a million times
B00GIYEHZ6|5.0|The color, quality and playback were excellent.  Very important with a splendidly visual movie such as this one.  And of course the content is in my opinion the best musicals ever made.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's a cool game! I love that you can connect to the console version and earn things for the console by playing on here and vice versa. It's addicting and you can play it all day long. I highly recommend this app to everybody.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app now loads on theKindleFire HDX and works great.  I've used on the Kindle Fire for some time and I think it is the best weather app out there.  This is a the only weather app l know of that has both active weather radar and earthquake information.<br /><br />Thanks for the upgrade.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is funny realistic and cool<br />My favorite part as to be him dressed as cupid
B006GWO5NE|5.0|All works well! The connection made the kindle come back to life.It seems the former connection which I had been using was deficient.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This  is a fun game. The difficulty is perfect for me and I recommend this to anyone. Quick hint: as soon as you have enough money, get the bike, it helps and I don't know maybe it's just me but the monster truck is terrible! :) ty
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie sucked. Hate to sound so harsh but I felt like I was watching a series on &#34;Nova&#34;, but it was less interesting. Beautiful cinematography, but 1.5 hrs of pretty pictures and no dialogue was painful. Glad I only paid the $2.99 rental fee and didn't fork out the big bucks to see it at a movie theatre.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome game best game on my tablet use it every day and don't know when I'll stop playing love it
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Horrible southern accents. Bad acting. Some characters not even in the movie that are main characters in the books! Worst movie ever! Even if they have another movie for the second book I wouldn't go see it if it were free.
B00GIZO674|4.0|It's a fun game to play. Nice timepass.<br />You can download it. Gives u a sense how McDonald's works. Good insights.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|If you are bored of play minecraft this is the next big thing its so fun its better than the xbox version plus its cheaper on the kindle than the computer and xbox. You might be thinking its freaking 5 $  well its worth it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an artfully written series that captures a time of great change illustrating the unintended consequences of war and technology on a well-established way of life.  Each character is left to adjust - or not adjust - to the changes and there are complex examples of kindness, greed, self-preservation and selflessness.  Maggie Smith's character alone makes it a 'must see'!<br /><br />A friend recommended this series and it tipped the balance for me to join Amazon Prime to watch it.  It is a bonus to be able to watch episode after episode without interruption.
B001676320|5.0|Toe tapping, hip swinging, feet shuffling great fun! What an extraordinary combination of EWF and Chicago talent! Younger audiences will remember the tunes their parents listened too when they were young and hum along while the parents will break out into spontaneous song and dance to the well remembered songs.
1250037751|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore<br /><br />  By Robin Sloan<br /><br />This is a tale that will yank you away and swirl you up into a fast-track frenzy of mystery, IT high-tech Google-stuff and a touch of romance. This is the PERFECT holiday book in that it not only gives you something to ponder as you're doling out Tom & Jerry's, but digs into the imagination of what we choose to believe and there's secret codes too! I found this gem while in Toronto not too long ago and yes, I was drawn in by the cover-art, but it is what's inside that hooked me and good.<br /><br />Meet Clay Jannon, a thirty-something recently unemployed IT dude in search of a job--any job. Living in downtown San Francisco and with an open mind and an empty check book Clay sets out to apply for just about anything he could find. Jobs in his field were gone, (marketing designer for a bagel company) offices were shuttered and work sent overseas. With rent looming and his choices dwindling, he took a chance and answered an ad;<br /><br />\\"HELP WANTED. Late shift. Specific Requirements. Good Benefits.\\"<br /><br />Written in first person and filled with witty dialogue and paced like lightening, you never know what is going to walk into the story next. Clay becomes the night clerk at Penumbra's and is told that the collection of rare books in the `waybacklist' is for special clients and they are to be carefully observed during each store visit. In fact, Clay is told to make very specific journal entries as to what they were wearing, their particular mood and what old tome they `check-out'. The weirdness begins as most transactions in this shop don't involve money.<br /><br />One of the many aspects of this novel I found really refreshing was how author Sloan mixed old-fashioned paper books with high-tech wizardry all the way from the dusty shelves of the bookstore to Google's main brain-house and back again and again.<br /><br />\\"Ah books...You know, old books are a big problem for us (at Google). Old knowledge in general. We call it OK. Old knowledge. Did you know that ninety-five percent of the internet was only created in the last five years? But we know that when it comes to all human knowledge, the ratio is just the opposite.\\"<br /><br />My one negative comment of Sloan's tale is the way he drops heavy thoughts into the story and then simply moves on. Like the above quote, filled with a message that is far from light and airy. Yet it's never explored and only seems to serve the purpose of confusion for the reader wondering where the heck that fits in?<br /><br />I won't reveal what the secret codes lead to or mean or offer, it's all wrapped up and solved by the last page and is truly worth the read as well as the final surprise reveal. One thing this book does with such a wonderful flair is leaves you with the reminder that old-fashioned books will always hold a prominent place of importance in our world.<br /><br />Yes!knowledge in general.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|INJUSTICE IS A GREAT GAME! I only wish that the inapp purchases cost less. Also you should make that if you do something such as beat a star mission or like the game you get a character.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Long-Overdue Writing Success by The Author Again, Back on Track Again. Going back in time to his winning ways and writing roots, John Grisham has finally returned to his writing roots in Mississippi history, writing a wonderful story of righting wrongs. Congratulations, John, and welcome back to my reading list after being absent too long.
B00EKR61FM|1.0|There is no way to watch them without the commentary! I tried everything and i could just watch the movies
0547391005|5.0|I bought this book for my niece.  This book has a collection of Curious George stories.  My sister-in-law was running out of books to read to her daughter and I bought this book for them.  I look through this book and recall many of these Curious George stories.  This is a great book to read to a young child and plenty of pictures to keep them entertained.  If you are looking for a bargain and great stories look no further.
B00FCAJZTK|4.0|For people who love Keith Jarrett this is a welcome addition to his wonderful creativity.  To people who want to explore more of Jarrett's other work, this might be a hard one to digest.  I love Keith Jarrett's work and this to me was a great look into what he does when he is not at the piano.  I am only curious to see if he has other stuff in his vault of treasures to give us.  The music here is quite interesting.  There is no band, it's just him playing every instrument there is.  His home studio has all the traditional Rock and Roll instrumentation and he makes his own one man Rock and Roll band.  He advises us to crank it up because it is meant to be played loud.  If your looking for something to listen to that is not your normal ECM release then this a great pick up.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|First let me say that I am a Science Fiction fan.  I have an extensive library of the great science fiction works and I will open up by admitting that I don't like it when folks call an action movie dressed up as science fiction, a science fiction movie. Now that being said, I can still appreciate a really good action adventure movie and I do like special effects.  However, I can't give this movie a good review.  Because......<br /><br />I fell asleep.  That's right.  I fell asleep.  I tried to finish it the next day.  I fell asleep again.  Nuff said, really.  It is slick looking, but it is mostly action.  What little dialog there is, is predictable and stilted and not well acted.  The sound engineers did a great job creating lots of exciting loud noises to go with all that action (and I have a massive sound system so it was very LOUD) and still, I fell asleep.  Why?  Well gee, could it have been that I didn't really care what happened to the characters?  Could it have been that I already knew what was going to happen?  There is no way I can give a good review to a movie that could not keep my attention.<br /><br />This movie is great for anyone under 25 who hasn't already seen a gazillion movies JUST LIKE THIS, with better plots and acting.  By just like this I mean little to no dialog (screen writers today have a pretty easy job) and lots of loud noises.  Let's just say this is not Indian Jones where we have a great quirky character that we actually care about or the Tobey Maguire Spiderman nor does it have the engaging mood of a lovingly choreographed martial arts film (all of which would have received 5 stars from me).  I would have been much more entertained had I cued up an original Godzilla film; \\"Destroy All Monsters\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />I promise you that at some point, and that age is different for men and women, everyone eventually grows very tired of this sort of thing.  Yes, action junky, this means you.  Eventually you will not be entertained bythis stuff.  So, for your own future, don't encourage the movie industry to continue to make movies like this.<br /><br />Well at least I got a really good nap out of it.
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|Some people will argue that Fifa is the best soccer game, but I disagree. In this great game, you play in matches, tournaments and survival competitions to become the best player out there. All the while, you are earning points to spend on player upgrades such as kick, speed, jump, ect. There are tons of players to unlock, but it is slow going to get them. There are also some fun little costumes to unlock, if you'd like to accessorize your player. It is a 2D style game with fairly good graphics, and the field is short. The ball can bounce everywhere, and there is no out of bounds. The main flaw is that the game play may get repetitive, but that hardly takes away points in my book. Overall, I suggest you get this game, whether you like soccer or not. After all, it's free!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic. Bought two immediately. Being able to quickly cast up to the tv is great. Kids love it. Would like better casting of desktop but that is still in beta, no doubt it will be better.  YouTube and Netflix was the real reason I got these and they run perfect.
B00BAXFACO|3.0|Connelly books are always well-plotted and move swiftly, and The Gods of Guilt is an involving, entertaining read. But this is far from the author's best. The characters aren't that interesting and hero Mickey Haller's motivations get thinner with each book.<br /><br />There is also an odd secondary plotline that keeps being brought up but never explained, (unless there was an intervening book in the series I somehow missed.) The previous Mickey Haller novel, the Fifth Witness, ends with Haller deciding to run for DA. As The Gods of Guilt opens, we find he lost the election due to a scandal--a client he had freed killed two people close to his daughter. Huh? Where'd that come from? The story just dangles there and functions only to explain why Haller and his daughter are estranged and why his ex has left LA.<br /><br />The matching daughter plotlines in both the Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller novels are weak. In both cases, the author seems compelled to provide his perennial bachelor heroes with some sort of personal life. But the daughters seem like Barbie dolls, just taken out of the box when dad needs a little humanizing. Interesting that Connelly didn't choose to give either of his characters a son.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|Tried every trick I could think of, but this game will not load on the kindle fire hd 8.9.  It installed with no problems.  But the game freezes the tablet and forces a manual reboot......
B00AZ7V0W0|1.0|because it arrived with a broken case and no extras. awesome set but arriv ed in a broken case very dissapointing.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Lyricism, Beats, Longevity, Crafty and well.... Eminem. Not his best album, just all around good music to slap in the whip.
1455525839|2.0|Of all the books they have written, this was by far the least enjoyable.  Most appropriate for a book due under contract and not nearly worthy of the normally intricate Pendergast tales.  I really hope this isn't a sign of things to come.  Preston and Child have been my favorite authors for years but this was disappointing to the extreme.
B00DCP006E|4.0|THis is a smoking hot release by the canadian thrashers.  I do miss the old days of them with Randy Rampage, but the lineup now is solid and rocks hard.  You can't go wrong with Jeff Waters smokin guitar licks.  The ballad is really out of place and thats the only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First off let me state without reservation that Suzanne Collins is an amazing author. Mockingjay is a well-written, fast paced thriller. It’s the plot that I actually disliked. I can’t give much detail because if I did, I would have to issue a spoiler alert. I think Collins is a victim of her own talents. In books one and two, I became so attached to the characters, I was really looking for a more positive path for some of the characters I grew to love. I can’t see how they will be able to make this one into a movie without some major changes. There must be a dozen different outcomes that would have been better than the disappointing path the author chose.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Now this is a movie.  The story line, the fact it is a true story is just great.  Steven Spielberg at this best.  Liam Neeson's greatest role IMHO.  After watching this movie when it originally came out, my wife loves Liam Nesson.  The entire cast from Ben Kingsley to Ralph Fiennes was just great.<br /><br />One of the best movies every made and will go down in history.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|Beautifully produced and very deliberately executed.  Doing away with harsh vocals really suits their style, and it's good to see them willing to deviate a bit more from what's expected of the genre they're in.<br /><br />A really fantastic album that absolutely grows on you as you puzzle through the progressive styles and polyrhythms.
B00868AF9O|5.0|I love this book. The book cover is what got my attention it's cute. Then when I started reading the book I couldn't stop reading it. This is a fun book to read. It's funny and will take your mind off anything that is bothering you. The book is also a little sad but is definitely one of the best books I've read. I know I will read it again and treasure it always.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|This album has too many producers, too many fingers in the pie, too many chefs in the kitchen (ok ok we all get the idea) ...<br />Some of the songs, \\"Queenie eye\\" for example sound so harsh that as great a song it basically is the overproduction ruins it.  I have very good/quality audio equipment so my source is not the problem.  As another person pointed out in his review McCartney is better off going back to the simplicity of his previous recent albums production wise anyways.  I'm a big Paul McCartney fan having seen him in concert & owning most of his post Beatles albums so it pains me to write anything negative about this album because what most people criticize about his other albums I usually like.  I really truly wanted to like this album; I do to a certain degree due mainly to the quality of his compositions but (ie.) it's like owning an expensive headphone with a high level of treble/sibilance; after a while I get listening fatigue & the experience stops being enjoyable.
0385537131|5.0|A really enjoyable read for John Grisham. This has been Grisham's best book since The Confession. The Racketeer was plain awful. Anyways, the book had a very good plot and a lot of emotion. A very good read and would recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game. Levels are challenging. My latest addiction. Doesn't have the ads that interrupt gameplay like so many free apps. Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a great game just like the temple run series and subway suffers games. it deserves four stars just great.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is entertaining tho it does lag a bit. But if you are a mlp fan you should play it.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|ok first off it took 2 hours for it to download and another 20 mind for it to install at one point while it was downloading it backtracked from 62% to 14%. then once the game downloaded and I started playing it I realized how annoying it is the music made me want to stab my ears and if u pause it you cant control the sound then as soon as ur done with one game it jumps u to the next one so u don't even get a chance to turn the sound off on the main menu if u even can cuz every time I opened it it jumped me right into a game... sucks... annoying... DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!!!!
B005EWDA9M|2.0|Seems to me that Murakami has used a second-rate ghost writer who exaggerate on violence and sex, where the original would be less explicit. - it is just too much of everything! ( I have read almost everything M. has written).
B0096PAA6E|1.0|This years pretender. This garbage is for the blues, what the likes of the current crop of crap country stars does for real country music, or what Kenny G did to jazz. Poppy pablum marketed as a legitimate form of one of Americas truly original art forms. As phony and phoned in as the doo rag getups. Do yourself a favor seek out some real blues, no not the Clapton regurgitations either. Dig up some old Muddy, Wolf, Gatemouth, or Freddie King. This is more like Keb Mo with a distortion pedal and an effects rack, at least Keb could write a good tune occasionally.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Hands down, best Disney movie ever.  A great story with a princess who actually reads books and cares about her family.  Disney made a winner.
B00FX8CLSI|5.0|Outstanding guide for anyone interested in paracord ties. Very clear and concise instuctions and graphics. Highly recommended addition to anyone's library.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|This movie is a funny and clean Halloween classic.  Who doesn't love the weird family next door with the cooky antics?
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Easy quick read.  Certainly not his best work, but entertaining.  Good book for travel and can be put down and picked up easily after awhile away!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved the story, loved the characters and the actors. Top notch job all around. A slice of life one would never know about. Daneilla Denby-Ashe is magnificent as are Richard Armitage and the women who plays his mother…can't spell her name. Also the union guy who I've seen in so many NPR productions. The final scene is just perfect but I'm a hopeless romantic so I am totally prejudiced! Love the costumes and the scenery, the editing is excellent. Wish there were more episodes…I still want to know what happens to these characters! When the writer, director and actors can do this, make the viewer want to see more, then you know they've done their job well. Kudos.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie opens your eyes to the reality that has become our life. If this movie does not leave you upset and terrified at what will become our future, you have no heart. This was a must see movie about the foods we consume and how oblivious society has become.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|I saw Patton as a 17 year-old at it's original showing in the theater. I've watched it many times since.  The film never ceases to amaze me in every way. The sets, the action, the storyline, and most of all- George C. Scott as the man himself. Scott became Patton. There are many great moments in the film. Most of all, the movie speaks to a time that has passed and probably never will be again. Patton would have never survived our ultra-politically correct world. He barely survived the political correctness that existed in his day. Yet, the movie suggests that we all need heroes-and Patton was a hero. We don't have heroes like him today. That's our loss...
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|I loved this series.  The downside is that Disney cancelled it.  At least fans like myself can now complete our Clone Wars collection.
B00BAXFACO|3.0|A disappointing denouement to The Lincoln Lawyer.  As fast paced and with the same interesting plot twists as Connelly's other Lincoln Lawyer books, this came to a crisp crescendo but then fell flat.  It was as if the author found the smoking gun but then didn't know what to do with it, having written himself into a corner.<br />Further, some of the details about the law were so technically inaccurate it literally made my skin crawl. While most readers won't know the difference, still, if an author puts it out there, it should be accurate but this was anything but.  Without question, the book would have benefited from editing by someone versed in criminal law.<br />Overall, I give this three stars, and say sit this one out . . .
B005JE7XW0|5.0|This movie was a huge surprise! It is a light-hearted hiliarious comedy/horror that I found extremely entertaining. If you liked Tremors, you'll enjoy the silliness of this flick
B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you like F Paul Wilson you will love this!  I am not a real fan of science fiction but I really enjoy this style of it. The story is fast paced and has lots of twists and turns that make it hard to put down. The sci fi is not an &#34;in your face&#34; complete fantasy and is mixed with a bit of horror. The plot keeps you thinking that you understand reality right up until you come to the realization that you don't. This was a new author for me. I will be reading more of his works. Like F. Paul Wilson this author keeps you mentally and physically moving between the familiarity of the reality you know and the horror of finding a monster under your bed! Well worth the price.
B000TEPIYA|5.0|I remember as a child when I First Heard Their Smash Single No Rain an Becasue I was Hooked I Decided To Go Cop a copy an was a dedicated fan after listening to it I was a satisfied fan of their sound & style however no fan was ready for the tragedy that befell the group after the tragic demise of Hoon They May Have reformed to continue their unique style they just havent been able to top the charts like they did on their debut plus because my cd I've owned through Hell & back was no longer sounding as crisp as it did when I first purchased it but because of Amazon's great mp3 I made the purchase an Been Grateful since
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|I really liked it, actually... and then suddenly it stopped working and wouldn't start. The little puzzles were fun and the animations were cute. Wish I could have played it more.
B00GTZJLAK|2.0|Weak plot line, recycled material from the first two Cars movies, and flat characters. Rent if you want to see it, but don't bother dropping the bucks to buy it.
B00GX598FO|3.0|Not as good as the first, but still enjoyable to watch. The plot felt a little forced and contrived at times, but still good escapist entertainment.
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Cute twist on a racing movie. They include enough humor for adults to enjoy it, and my 5-year-old enjoyed watching it as well.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Love it this is so much fun.  This is great for the mind.  Keeps you on your toes looking for the items.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Love it so fun and exiting played this game all night. Great game can't wait to play it again. Joy
B008M721MS|5.0|i would, NO! ,could not, have not been away from my 6 year old, for a period of time, with just speaking with her. Being able to see her eyes, to know if things were ok with her is invaluable!, Peace of your mind, when thousands of miles away!
B00005V9IL|5.0|Love the movie, nothing cut!  Great picture quality too. James Cameron  gives us the picture that we are not alone in this world. That we should open our minds to the possibilities of more advanced lifeforms around us! Looks at humanity as we are living in this day and age.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing book series...even better than the movies. Could not put it down once I started reading. Looking forward to the last two movies.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|more about her and not the John Lennon of the Beatles disappointed in the music would not recommend look further for Johns music
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it and even dreamed about it. There were parts that I despaired over, the time in Las Vegas I found a very sad commentary on our society. But overall I was so enchanted and caught up in the story that I re-read the last two chapters the next day. I loved the beautiful descriptions and the deep insight into the human condition. I looked up the Goldfinch painting and cried for that little bird.  I will at some point buy a small art print to frame and hang in a special spot. I looked up several other paintings and artists referenced in book.  This is a book I will read again and again.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|From Up on Poppy Hill is not the kind of film anyone familiar with the names Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki might come to expect from the Oscar-winning and blockbuster studio and director.<br /><br />But while this film written by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa and directed by Hayao’s son Goro Miyazaki may be the opposite of the more fantastical films they are known for, it isn’t any less beautifully animated nor less emotionally affecting.<br /><br />From Up on Poppy Hill tells the story of Umi Matsuzaki, a 16-year old high school student in 1963 Yokohama. While taking care of her family’s boarding house and its residents in the mornings and evenings, she takes an interest in helping fellow student Shun Kazama work to save her school’s dilapidated clubhouse from demolition.<br /><br />Working together soon draws them closer to each other until a surprising past is revealed that momentarily puts a stop to the feelings they have developed for each other.<br /><br />And while that little tidbit sounds very soapy, especially for an animated film from Studio Ghibli, it is only one small part of the greater narrative.<br /><br />And that narrative is one that evokes a dream-like nostalgia very much present in the previous works of Miyazaki, the senior. The signature hand-drawn animation beautifully brings to life a more idyllic, yet at the same time tensely transitional period in Japan’s history.<br /><br />Serving as a window to the country and its people after World War II and the Korean War and before the successful 1964 Tokyo Olympics, From Up on Poppy Hill is a nostalgic and warm slice of life drama. It paints the picture of a bustling, but hometown feeling port city during a much simpler time, making it relatable to people of any culture or ethnicity. Specifically, it touches on the quickly developing country, eager to recover from the painful decades before.<br /><br />Thinking of Studio Ghibli and the master that is Hayao Miyazaki, one immediately thinks of such fantastical films as Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro or fiercely thought provoking films like Princess Mononoke and pre-Ghibli Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And while it shares many of the same qualities, From Up on Poppy Hill is a much simpler story.<br /><br />But it is in its simplicity that From Up on Poppy Hill draws its best, unique qualities. It is at times a heartwarming story of friendship and young love and at others, a fun look at childhood and youth. The film subtly, but effectively conveys that poignant nostalgia that can make even a 26-year old youngin like me can get teary eyed at the thought of a much simpler time.<br /><br />The film takes care to point out how important the past is in our present and future. For the characters, it is their holding on to their pasts that help get them through to their futures. That’s a philosophy I personally subscribe to as well, making it that much more meaningful to me.<br /><br />So yes, the film does have plenty of MaGMCMs, including right at the end when everything just sinks in. And that may just be a trademark of a Hayao Miyazki written screenplay.<br /><br />While the younger Miyazaki, Goro, drew a tepid response to his directorial debut, the uneven Tales from Earthsea, he recovers very well here and shows that he does have a promising future following in his father’s very big footsteps.<br /><br />From Up on Poppy Hill may not have the grand, fantastical adventure of other Studio Ghibli films, but it is just as engaging and contains just as much magic thanks to its beautifully breathtaking visuals, likeable characters and sincerely nostalgic story.such fantastical films as Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro or fiercely thought provoking films like Princess Mononoke and pre-Ghibli Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry.  Ok I am a mindless idiot when I play games and I like matching games.  The game is responsive to touch on a Toshiba Thrive and a lot of fun.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Music has a nice beat to it.  Creative colorful tunes. Lady Gaga has a beautiful voice as well as being very inventive with her lyrics.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love Candy Crush is very addictive to the point I lose sleep!! My favorite game.At times it can get frustrating but you keep on trying to get to the next level.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I wanted to see this movie originally in the movie theater thinking with the big screen and nice sound system, it would be a great film for that. But as usual (mostly anyway), I let the first week go by and after that, there are other things to do and this movie got put on the 'backburner' to watch when it came out to rent. But with Amazon Prime, I didn't have to even do that. I was able to stream it 'free' at home which was nice. Another thing I seem to do lately with Prime movies, is to not watch all of the movie in one evening. This one took three different days and not all concurrently. I would say that it took a good week until the third night to finish this. But I am glad I did. It is a very powerful movie in it's message of life and death and of Alcoholism and freedom, and friends and family.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to give away any of the story, other reviews might do that? I just want to say that there is a lot going on in this movie on a few different levels. It has nudity in the beginning, a bumpy plane ride, smoking, drinking, snorting, language, drunkenness (first time I ever spelled that word), so for the younger kids, I don't recommend it. But for adults, by the time you finish this movie, you will have cried some and laughed some and felt something emotional when it's all said and done!<br /><br />I recommend this movie for sure for adults that can handle all of the above which does occur in the movie to portray this story around the pilot played by Denzel Washington, who does a believable role for this movie. All of the supporting cast does a fine job also to make the movie what it is.<br /><br />I recommend it, I just wish for the good old days when I was able to watch a movie in it's entirety!! in one seating.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He is my favorite author, I have not read on book that did not keep flipping though the pages.  Great and easy way though amazon putting in on my kindle.  I have to remember to pick it up again after the holiday, of coarse I am hoping for gift cards at Christmas to download more books, fast, easy and they don't  take up much room.<br />Patti
B00A4OALL0|4.0|Lacks the overall feel of Shorter's other recent live albums being more like what it is, a collection of live tracks than a performance (ias was Footprints Live but it somehow felt more like one show) but still a great treat from the master.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Just like several other reviewers, Some of the discs worked, others didn't. Plus, the box was mangled, and the jacket was torn.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Once again Baldacci has written a book that you can't put down once you get started. Great storyteller. Really love the King and Maxwell characters. Have read all his books and like this one, none will every disappoint you. All great reads.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Loved this series.  Hated how long it took for the last book to come out.  Really intriguing and interesting story line.
B009CGQOI0|3.0|Classic Al Pacino movie, but it's far too long. Yes I appreciate the art that is the film as the director's work, but if you're looking for an easy watch then look elsewhere.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If you want to really grow and get rid of the mental and emotional stuff in your life.  You should read this one.  Just four simple guidelines to follow.  Be sure to have a pen and paper nearby.  Or read with a friend because you will want to discuss this book, but importantly you will want to live it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's Addicting and challenging. This is a very good game. The only thing its missing is more choices for guns.
B004GYY714|5.0|Can't get any better in radio.  It doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to you can find it on Tunein radio.  I like listening on my Kindle when I am reading.  Think you will like it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great deal on the series which my wife loves. Easy decision as it has all the episodes in one bundle.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game to play..fast pace...run out of money fast..still just figuring it out but keeps you interested.. Would recommend. It's free..so nice to try.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Exciting and compelling read that every adult who loves hiking and adventure would enjoy.  WILD is rich, full of raw and honest truth about Cheryl's transformation from weakness, pain, and confusion to strenth, freedom, and confidence as she pounded away the grueling and beautiful miles of the PCT with a &#34;monster&#34; on her back.  Her writing is full of courage and strikes a cord, especially in women, who will likely find a piece of themselves in her quest.  More than a good book.  WILD is a great story!
B00BAXFACO|5.0|After wading through the latest Robicheaux novel and branching out to other crime authors, I found The Gods of Guilt to be a refreshing re-introduction to Connelly.  Mickey Haller is a great character and I found this novel to be the best of the Haller series.  It was fast-paced, highly readable.<br /><br />I realize some might miss the intracacy and complexity of other Connelly novels, but I thought it brought enough of these attributes together to make the entire reading experience pleasurable.<br /><br />Good job!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|But the ending that was needed. I thought this was a great end to the trilogy. I was mad, excited, anxious and in tears.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and hope they eventually make a movie out of it. The ending was unique....poetic justice
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We regularly watch netflix through this.  Easy to control with our phones or ipads and once the content is streaming we can use our phones // tablets for other browsing or apps.  We also have occasionally cast web pages.  We like no longer needing to have our ps3 on.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This album shows Muse's range - part rock, part pop, part experimental, all entertaining. They can do it all and do it well. The drama and showmanship are apparent.
0385537131|5.0|There has never been a John Grisham book yet that I didn't love. I will read this again...soon. Great read
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|As much as I love American Horror Story, I feel like this season was a good example of over thinking the sophomore attempt. There is so much going on: alien abduction, possession, human reanimation experiments, nazis...And it doesn't all sum up well. It's still enjoyable but I definitely preferred the first season.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great product if you understand what its' purpose is. I mainly use it to stream Youtube videos from my phone or iPad. I also occasionally use it to play music. I must say, the streaming quality on it is fantastic. I have had no issues with it. It is incredibly detailed and smooth.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Kitchen Confidential was a fun read, playing into my inner foodie...for the first half of the book. After that, it felt repetitive and dull. Different kitchen, same drill. The last half is targeted at people who want to work in restaurants, and I am not one of those people.
159420411X|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I recommend it to anyone (not just those interested in statistics). It really changed the way that I look at the world and the stats that are constantly thrown in my face.
006202406X|1.0|I'll be quick. This book was horrible. Everyone has pretty much pointed out all of the problems and I must say reading the reviews of others I have decided that any number of you could have written a better book. I cried, I don't want to read it again, I want another ending, and just a whole new book. Don't read it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It contains so much history that is not generally known, and it is wonderfully written.  There are many new insights into the man, his achievements, and his family.  I especially enjoyed learning about his contemporaries - allies and enemies.  They are now more than names in a history book.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a superb historian and is able to communicate her knowledge and research in a compelling and accessible style.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT GEORGE HARRISON...EVER.  THE CD'S ARE IN PERFECT CONDITION AND SOUND SO GOOD.  WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO ADD THIS TO OUR SMALL COLLECTION.  THE PRICE WAS SO REASONABLE.  AND IT CAME QUICKLY WHICH WAS A NICE SURPRISE.
0061124958|5.0|Came in perfect condition. I love the illustrations. This book is excellent for those who like pictures and although a bit big for a child, the type is somewhat big itself.
B000P0J024|5.0|GREAT CD'S - EVERY SINGLE ONE.  THE DVD WAS SO COOL TO WATCH.  TO SEE OUR FAVORITE OLD ROCKERS - GEORGE HARRISON, ROY ORBISON, TOM PETTY, AND THE REST JUST HANGING OUT WITH THEIR GUITARS...WRITING MUSIC TOGETHER...VERY COOL.
B00274EYKY|5.0|What can I say, I am a BIG Mickey Rourke fan! Love him so much. Great cast and great script!
0316067598|5.0|Vivid account of Mr. Luttrell's experience in becoming a SEAL and he lets us feel his emotions in battle and fighting to survive.  Really appreciated his comments about how the liberal press has been allowed to negatively affect our soldier's mindset in war.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|By far not one of my favs from them. Was expecting a lot better! Nothing I could bang my head to!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game, addictive, and fun. I will just cut the time in between slaps once you rain out of lives,  you have to wait to much to play again.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Love the author and the way she tells a great story.Follows 3 generations that overcome hardship.<br />Americans in China had it rough.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is a boatload of fun If you don't own the console game. You definitely have to download this.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|After using the built in flash for years I don't want to taker this thing off! I have an older Nikon (D60) and it pairs perfectly. I ordered a soft box as well and it feels like an entirely different camera.<br /><br />There are so many settings! Most of it is automatic and changes based on the camera.<br /><br />Master and remote flash controls are nice but I don't have need of it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good game, kinda like farmvill. It's fun but I only don't like that a lot of the additions to your town are cash only that are paid for out of your pocket. And I can't justify paying money for that. I'll just play without or not play it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The game works great and is tons of fun. Plus, the price is cannot be beat. Highly recommend for  fans of the arcade game.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It lags sometimes and also takes FOREVER to load the first time. Over all a great game though. Get it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It does not get along with my router and this seams to happen allot seeing they directed me to a list of routers it does not get along with and technical manuals on this that make no sense.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Can't say much more than that.  Saw it when it was in the theatre, and bought it recently.  Found it as good the second time around as the first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is a great read,I did not want to put it down!!!!!!! Read before going to see it at the movies.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|This video most of the time keep freezing , I have the fastest internet but I stool waiting for the. Ideology to load very disappointing. Amazon should remove the video..supposed zero star....
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game starts out a little tedious BUT once you get past the initial set up it's super fun and addictive!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game on the Kindle, It's so much fun plus you don't have to connect it to the internet to play. I highly recommend this game for any minecraft  users on the go.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|This was the first movie in a long time that my grandchildren actually sat (relatively) still and watched all the way through! Amazing accomplishment!! Grandpa and I enjoyed it greatly as well! Good for all ages!
B00GQ7OZR0|4.0|I am a huge Dexter fan and while I can see why some people felt that this season was a little weak, it was still fun to watch and I'm not disappointed I watched it.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Used it on two Droid phones and Kindle Fire HDX. Got comfortable with it.<br />Helped me debug many Wi-Fi installations. Very clear very consize.<br />I wish one could connect to a WiFi spot one found from inside the app.<br />I wish the app was faster locking to a WiFi source: I had some difficulties trying to diagnoze router that was failing intermittently because of latency of the display even at fastest setting.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Fresh batteries for 1/5 the local price and a reasonable delivery time too. A little planning to save a lot. What's not to like?
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I have just found another author & series that I can't wait to read! The characters, setting and plot were excellent and kept me wanting more!
B0060D123K|3.0|The quality of the video is fine. I am gravely disappointed that three minutes of the movie is missing. I have the VHS tape, which is 89 minutes; the streaming version is 86 minutes. The full song, &#34;The Love is Gone,&#34; sung by Belle was cut out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is on of the bes games I have ever played in my life! I love competing with my friends for the highest score. The only bad thing is that it is so addicting that I just sit there playing gor hours on end and forhet to eat or do anything important. I am obsessed!
B005IQZB14|4.0|The difficulty of her journey made you feel for her. Many times I wondered if she would be able to continue.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|#awesome<br />This is the best book I've read it's very well written but a bit sad. It's  also very addictive to read i love Lemony Snicket:)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved every minute of it. Did not want to put it down. Although it is a long one, the history makes it worthy of your investment of time.
1851522409|5.0|Of course it's fabulous. It has his masterpieces, the Smiley books. This is the only volume I've found with all 3 and it wasn't expensive.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|Beautiful boxed set but made very cheaply. the accordion style for holding the CDs is horrible falls apart all CDs come out. but show is great DVD's are great. I had the opportunity to meet Larry Hagman Barbara Eden and Bill Daly and have them sign this I use it as a collectible piece I don't actually watch it because it's so flimsy. overall poor design but very pretty to look at.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are partners in their PI firm.  They are also one time lovers (literally, one time), who now maintain a business like arrangement even though the sexual energy between them is crackling.  By happenstance, they become involved in helping a young boy find out what happened to his father, who has disappeared in Afghanistan on a mission.  Things get strange in a hurry, as government agencies step in, rogue operators attack, and Sean and Michelle try to work out the puzzle.  This is a fun, fast read with a lot of moving parts to keep things interesting.
B000XXI8G2|4.0|Great pair of boots. Only complaint is that they run larger in size than expected. If you order them, go with a half size smaller than you normally wear.
B00631HASU|5.0|I've been playing Zuma for years.  This is the best Android version I've played.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />Turn off wifi and play.  Don't worry about permissions.<br />Nice low key music and sound. Adjust to desired level.  Or turn it down and play your own.<br />Responsive controls. No lag.<br />Extras that original Zuma didn't have. Amulets to use for power-ups to help finish levels.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />It's not the newest version.  Yeah, I'm whining.  That's all I could come up with.  I think this is a good app and recommend it.<br /><br />Glad it was the FATOD. Deal at twice the price.  :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This amazing story was so hard to put down that I read it in a day! There was so many twists in this heartbreaking story that I ached for Holder, Sky, Les and Karen.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|There are a few great films that make all other movies, no matter how wonderful, seem frivolous by comparison. Steve McQueen's \\"12 Years a Slave\\" is one of those. The true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man in upstate New York in 1841 who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, the film shows the total horror and degradation of living as a slave, as well as the total corruption of slave traders and masters.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly, burningly powerful as Northup, a man torn from his happy family life to face years of torture and brutalization. You could call his experience a Hitchcockian nightmare, except that the phrase trivializes the absolute horror of his situation. Yet as hideous as Northup's situation is, it is relatively comfortable compared with the fate of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a woman enslaved by plantation owners Edwin and Martha Epps (Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson). The epitome of crazed corruption, Edwin likes to pretend that Patsy is his mistress by choice, and Martha likes to pretend that Patsey is her rival. Both are too twisted to recognize the truth: that Patsey is a helpless pawn driven to the brink of suicide by the unspeakable sadism of her master and mistress.<br /><br />The very title gives away that Northup's servitude comes to an end. Yet even when it does, there is no feeling of closure; he lost 12 years of his life for no reason, and Patsey and the other slaves live on in agony. \\"12 Years a Slave\\" is a movie that lingers powerfully in the memory, and stands as a rebuke to films that made the plantation system look benign (\\"Gone with the Wind\\") or turned it into an action-revenge-movie joke (\\"Django Unchained\\"). It is the best film of the year, and one of the best of the decade.
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Won't let you go back and finish what you have pieces for once you enter the door where they want you to pay to continue. Also abit high for just a click and go game.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Great music - the entire album is just awesome and all songs are just catchy and addicting to listen to
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King's take on time travel, the Kennedy assassination,  and the butterfly effect.  This book does not disappoint. I especially liked his depiction of the late fifties and early sixties:  fond, but never sentimental.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Have never heard anything sung by her that I didn't like.  This album is certainly no exception. Would recommend it to everyone.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This is one good CD.<br /><br />1. Bad Romance: first single off the album is an epic dance track and is a great way to start off this &#34;Monster&#34;. 10/10<br /><br />2. Alejandro: great dance track which is a little underwhelming starting off with gaga's Spanish accent which is okay but could use work. 9/10<br /><br />3. Monster: great dance track though the repeated line in this song get a tad annoying, at least to me. 9/10<br /><br />4. Speechless: great piano ballad. 'nuff said. 10/10<br /><br />5. Dance In The Dark: good dance track. pulsating beats are epic. 10/10<br /><br />6. Telephone: awesome dance track and Beyonce adds to it greatly. 10/10<br /><br />7. So Happy I Could Die: great dance track. 'nuff said. 10/10<br /><br />8. Teeth: easily the weakest track on the album. 4/10<br /><br />OVERALL: Fun album from &#34;The Mother Monster&#34; herself. Highly Recommended! 9/10
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Interesting and challenging. Lots of fun to play. You can play it quickly and not worry about being in the middle of a level if you have to stop. Great while waiting for appointments.<br /><br />,
B006CHML4I|4.0|Love this watch: I appreciate the clean look, and logical layout - I wear it almost everyday.<br /><br />My only complaints are:<br />1) It loses a few minutes time after several days<br />2) After 8 months of daily use, the bottom band is becoming ratty
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I keep a few hard cover books close by that I return to now and again because of the way the words  have made me feel. Now I have another!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great levels fun game awesome graphics enjoy playing this game so much connected to facebook easy to download and fast leveling
B001VEVIPK|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  That's the good news.<br /><br />It was depressing and full of despair.  That's the bad news.  I don't tolerate animal cruelty very well as an adult and can't imagine how I would have reacted as a kid.  The rats and cats don't have a lot of respect or liking for the human race and by the end neither did I.<br /><br />\Still, I couldn't put it down and am glad I read it .... as an already-jaundiced adult.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Do not buy this app! It does not work! It would not even download for me! Do not waste your time.
B00E8JZILA|3.0|I got the item in a timely manner but the game was just too short, but it was a different game play.
B003VANOFY|2.0|This is not a case of &#34;get what you pay for&#34; because the price was steep and the features weren't that spectacular. This lasted for 2 years before I finally replaced it. You may think that paying almost $300 for a headset would mean it would last longer, but in actually it started having issues 6 months after I bought it. It would periodically disconnect from the base station and all audio would cut out (sending/receiving) while on a call or listening to music/games. It got worse and worse and I finally had enough of it and motivated enough to replace it after it cutting out 10 times during a 1.5 hour call. The cut outs would last 5 seconds. REALLY annoying and embarrassing on a call. Oh, did I mention that this was the 2nd one I bought? I was a fool.<br /><br />If this review gives you anything to take away, I bought 2 of these and BOTH had the same disconnection and audio disruption issue after 6 months. DO NOT BUY LOGITECH.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Excellent story line, it just needs a little more build up. I'm looking forward to what the next storyline is going to be.<br />Looking forward to movie number two.

B00G7QPTR0|1.0|The movie was ok But I was very upset with the live in Atlantic City dvd. It was not the whole concert in fact they edited out half of the show and water down a lot of the songs . What is the point of showing a concert if you are not going to show the whole thing
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|My two year old went wild for this book.  Sweet and silly fun for the whole family.  Our grey cat even got in on the action, sitting on my lap listening to me read.  Probably thought the book was about her!
B00632HWOG|1.0|since the upgrade I haven't been able ti access my accounts. :p. freezes and never opens on my kindle fire.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Just happy that I found it. I read that it was being discontinued. Grandson will be very happy this Christmas.
0143118706|3.0|After reading Eat, Pray, Love, was a little disappointed with this book. Couldn't put the first book down but I haven't finished reading Committed as yet.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great conclusion to this series!  I saw a lot of comments before I read it complaining that it didn't end they way many would have liked... that made me aware the ending may be unexpected... and boy was it!  This series has never claimed to be a &#34;feel good&#34; series.  The whole series is a very creative, interesting and high-energy story.  It didn't end the way I wished, but it did end in a way that honored the story and the characters.
B00C9G22R2|5.0|Great movie. IP man I & II were good as well. Great pictures captured via camera. Subtitles make it hard to keep up with the story. It is not a pure action movie with fights all the time. He used a good balance of telling the story and fitting the fight scenes in. Showing a few different type of eastern style fight scenes. Brutal, powerful, elegant and extreme awesome slow motion shooting.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Very smooth working card game. Works in landscape or portrait on KF. Has a hint button. You can change appearance. Controls are simple. I would recommend.
B001E25MBK|5.0|Wonderful set, beautifully remastered in Blu-ray. Worth every penny. Great gift idea for the movie fan in your home. Truly is a classic to be cherished.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|funny, engrossing; just reads itself<br /> this was suggested by a friend as a bit of a pick me up read, and it definitely leaves you feeling bouyant
B00AO686MY|5.0|Love this movie. Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and the many voice talents make this movie enjoyable. I cannot believe it's 25 years old. Brings back many fond memories that I can share with my children. Great buy in Blu-ray.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can get any radio station in the world or any genre of music at ANY time!  The best music app I have found!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Typical Cruise action flick.  Enjoyable!  The action is to save the world from a nuclear rouge who intends to destroy the world.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Incredibly moving and heart warming. The author really wrote how at least I felt at that age. So emotional and crazy. I didn't want it to end, but it ended just perfectly.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Entertaining movie with some action and suspense.  Good movie with a subtle message. This is one of Michael's best movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think  this game is AWSOME never get boring whenever  I'm bored this is what I play I love it
159184617X|5.0|This is a great book. Kahney gives you so much detail about Jony's design, from the Bondi Blue of the iMac to the design patterns of Apple through the ages. I'm really able to connect with the book and is a must read for designers and Apple fans alike.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Super fun but sometimes it freezes and you lose credits.<br />Would certainly recommend to all. Very addictive and love it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes the things that happen in this highly addictive game surprise me, but always pleasantly!!! Friends kept telling me to give it a try...glad I did
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I played this on an other device but it is still awesome<br />I just love this game so much<br />If you have`t<br />Played this play now it's flipping awesome
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it's an addicting game I play on my phone that now I can play in a larger version.  Just as addicting.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I've been enjoying AccuRadio for several years now.  Listening on the Kindle Fire is no exception. Please keep it going!
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|I can't believe intelligent people who should have command of the language have to use the &#34;f&#34; word in every sentence.<br />I am trashing mine
6302797535|5.0|A very funny movie, but only if you're a detective story fan and can 'get' all the in jokes about the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play Candy Crush on my computer and it is the same on my Kindle. That is not always the case.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Definitely enough twists and turns to have you guessing up to the very end about who is good and who is emil, what is true and what is fantasy.  With all that, still a fairly easy story to follow, and that can't be easy to do.  good production!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great collection of Kelly Clarkson's best hits and I highly recommend it to her fans.  This came in very timely and I would definitely recommend this seller.
B004132HZS|5.0|You may like Sherlock, and you may hate him, but I can guarantee you wont be bored by these stories or the characters, even if you know all the Conan Doyle novels already.
B00006RAKP|5.0|For anyone who loves anything Elton John, this is the best buy and a great value for all the wonderful hits you get with this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I think Grisham is an excellent writer and this book really was no exception. There were a few slow parts, and it was a little predictable, but still a very good read. If you like Grisham, or his type of books, I would recommend this one.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love anything by Pink and this CD doesn't disappoint because it has all her top hits on one CD.  I received this very timely and would recommend this seller.
B0015346OM|5.0|One of the best books of its kind. Period. This is a book you read and then you read again
B00AGE20ZI|3.0|Because it's a Christmas Classic! Loretta Young was very elegant, Cary Grant was debonair. Nice story too. Right up there with Miracle on 34th St.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|Would recommend you rent the movie before you buy this. Unlike the fairy tale, this movie is not for children.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Keeps me questioning the whole time, and now I am so excited to read the final book in the series
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really love this  game because it's fun yet challenging and I like to try to get all three stars so it sums up to be a verry fun and great game that everyone who is thinking about getting it , should :)
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Got tired of it after awhile but it is a good quick game when killing time. Pretty much a long poop game.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I absolutely LOVE Minecraft. Not going to lie about dat. But I've been doing some looking around for 0.8.0 update, but NO POSTS HAVE REALEASE DATE FOR A KINDLE FIRE! IT'S ALL IOS AND ANDROID. DRIVING ME UP THE WALL.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|just couldnt follow the story line.  Will try again later. no doubt Moriarty is an accomplished writer- the problem was my mindset at the time of reading.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I purchased several of these to give as gifts.  I viewed this at a neighbor's home, and it was such an eye-opener I knew I had to order one for myself and more for those I love!
B000002LIM|5.0|music is crisp and clear and is the exact same heard from the movie :)<br />buy this soundtrack, you wont regret it.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This neat adapter allows you to fit in two cheaper MicroSD cards (ideally using the same make) to Sony's devices that use the more expensive Pro Duo cards. Both MicroSD cards work in a RAID 0-like configuration, so both essentially combine their available storage for use, meaning two 16GB MicroSD cards in the adapter will result in a 32GB Pro Duo.<br /><br />Anybody who is looking into or already has a PSP should look into getting one of these, especially those who have installed custom firmware on theirs in order to get the most out of this. Just be aware that the PSP can't really utilize any more than 32 GB of storage, so settle for two 16GB cards if you intend to buy one of these. After inserting this into the system, format the card through the system before using it, and you're all good to go.<br /><br />One particular problem I have is that the build quality does not look all that good; it looks fairly cheap and I've heard the odd reports of this becoming a problem, with one having to use tape to hold the MicroSD cards in place and another having their data corrupted every now and then. Perhaps a more reliable alternative would be to instead get a single slot adapter and opt for a 32 GB card if you are skeptical, but for the most part this adapter works as intended.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Don't believe the hype, if you liked the first two books you will like this one.<br />Nothing lives up to the excitement of the first book, but same writing style and characters make this another fast and engaging read.  At first I wasn't a fan of seeing things from a perspective other than Tris's, but it definitely works.
1932100660|4.0|Well written, although partly too long and speculative. The results  are unexpected and sometimes unbelievable. Longevity does not need always low protein diet, there are  many other environmental factors.
B0014QABX0|5.0|Love this band need to see them live. I want to own all of their albums. This is one of their better albums.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love this book and the ending disappointed me a little but only the slightest bit cause it surprised me. I can't wait for the movie to come out. The whole series deserves over 5 stars it is truly an amazing book.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|Got these last year for the boys for Christmas, they were ages 4 and 7. They have been played with EVERY day since. And we have added to the set with more blocks. I love to build with them, too. Best blocks I ever bought. Great for them to use imagination and combine with other toys to play for hours. My kids build towers and tracks and houses and stairs, you name it. Then they add lego guys and other figures to play in them.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is awesome on the kindle fire. Hours of game play and awesome graphics. Lots of fun. A must have
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire together in this movie.  They are both such timeless men.  I would love to live in the farm house in that movie!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I think this game is fun and entertaining along with its other similar games such as wedding dash deluxe and I am happy to have it for free
B001BR7CZW|4.0|I liked this movie basically because of the action scenes. The high speed chase in the end is unreal! The girlfriend trying to kill Jake is so funny, all this works so well and makes for a very good movie. Man, how many cars were destroyed in this movie? Who cares though the movie must have had a nice budget. I enjoyed watching this movie and seen it several times.
B00C5R71U8|5.0|Simply a great read.  Now I understand Jony Ive and his design philosophy a bit better.  If you buy Apple products you will enjoy reading this book.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Intriguing and compelling concept but shallow and superficial characters that you do not really care about.  The &#34;circle&#34; and it's (un) intended consequences are really the star here.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who loves Bryson and the facinating historical minutia that he digs up. He gives texture, humor and context to what would only be sterile facts in a history book.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|very interesting movie.  Kept me watching to keep up with it. In fact, would like to watch it again. definitly recommend it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I liked this game on the computer, and when it was free, I had to get it! Turns out, it's better on the Kindle Fire than on the computer. Get this game!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Haven't listed to this one yet, but have bought all of Susan Boyles CDs.  Never any problem with them and her voice is incredible.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it, looking forward to seeing the movie now, a really wow roller coaster and a very powerful ending that sets up the next book beautifully
B005KP7EO0|4.0|I found it to be entertaining and well acted. The story line was interesting and plausible. I liked it a lot.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book was eye opening and makes life just make more sense. I had a family death while reading this book, and what I learned in this book really helped me to cope. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, believers as well as non-believers.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Need more apps, it only plays a few. I was expecting more, disappointed. I was expecting more especially when it's a google product
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|its an awesome game but it freezes a lot, and at random points when I get into it, it closes so it has to reaload. pls fix gameloft.(still really cool game) .
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This is a spectacular sci-fi thriller that gets you hooked and dosent let go! Dennis quaid is great in this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome the first couple of days I had it I couldn't put it down! I did get stuck on a level once but I no I can beat it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book to read about a true American hero. Just wish more people would support these guys for what they go through just to do what they do
0307352153|5.0|This is the first book I have found that explains and demonstrates the qualities of being introverted rather than disdain it. Now I don't feel so &#34;alone&#34; in this world where it seems many people are shouting to pretend they are &#34;right&#34;. Quiet should be in every school's library and required reading for teachers and parents alike. Bravo Susan Cain !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is extravagant and makes a good ending to the trilogy ! Also I wish it could continue !!!!!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|ive always had kik on my cell but have always wanted it on my tablet kindle fire. i love it soo much! thank you for finaly making it!!!
B001NLKS16|5.0|I love that the book talked about the monsters, ghosts, and demons from the show. I also thought that it was cool that an angel from last season, and thus the basis for what is happening this season on the show (Metatron) was mentioned.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I feel like I missed something here. This is so opposite of the movie that I'm not sure where to begin, well it's got wonderful pace, in spite of or because of the narrative, interview style. I am captivated and literally traveling with him to each of these people in each of their most different places. Great read, great, book, good movie.<br />Bravo
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book so detailed I cried at the end. I can't wait to get Catching Fire and watch the movie.
B00GQ8LUEA|2.0|After starring in a series with one of the best ending episodes ever (6 Feet Under), Michael Hall can now also claim that he has starred in Dexter, which has one of the worst series ending episodes ever.  I don't want to denigrate the entire season based on the final episode, but it was so poorly done that I cannot give the season more than 2 stars.  Without spoiling the ending for others, if that's possible with this dismal finale, I have to say that the conclusion of this series was illogical, improbable and inconsistent based upon the history of his character.  I understand that they wanted to finish this series with a dramatic, perhaps unexpected ending.  In attempting that, however,  the writers expect the viewer to accept that Dexter's new found sensitivity has caused a metamorphosis into an idiot who repeatedly makes the same mistake.  In addition, we are expected to accept he is suddenly capable of abandonment in the one of the few areas he has expressed feelings throughout the series.  This is a quantum leap that very few viewers are going to be able to make in the course of a single episode.  It's too bad that a poorly conceived finale will diminish what was an intriguing and very entertaining show.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very addictive game! I highly recommend it, doesn't take much skill to learn , but takes time to master. Go get it!
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|This game is just like a Pc game called Luxor an Egyptian based game of Zuma. Very fun and awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is fun my brothers and sister luv it it's something that I can do when I'm bored or getting my hair done works on all device good free game it's a mixture of temple run and subway u should get it and don't regret it
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|This entire book should be included on the DVD as an &#34;Extra&#34; that you should watch before you settle in with your popcorn. I don't know how many times I have watched the iconic movie but I guarantee I will watch it many more times because of what I learned in Scarface: The Ultimate Guide.  Damian Stevenson has written a fantistic account of the movie and teaches you some really intriguing points about the movie's message.  Claiming to be the &#34;Ultimate Guide&#34; is an understatement.  This book delivers beyond ultimate.  I wish there were books this good for all of my favorite movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|From start to finish Sycamore Row kept my interest with its many twists and turns in plot. Will the black servant of a rich man get most of his fortune or will his children who rarely saw him get his money,violating the wishes of a hand written will. The book concludes with a solution that seems to please all parties..
B003K16PFU|3.0|The first half of the book was pretty good concerning his wartime experiences, but the detailed political aspects of the civil war lost me in acronyms.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome I'm just doing this review for the gems. So hit me up if you wanna be neighbors or whatever
B00486070K|5.0|Works without a hitch. I tried third party ones that are cheaper but I keep coming back to the Apple, because it simply works.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the story line and the continuing saga.  I'm not sure but I think it is based on real event<br />I have watched since it started season only.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Convenient, but I wish it had other Google programs like Google docs, and more.  Hopefully they will work together and make it better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thrilling. Scary because it could be our future. A real page Turner, I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to read the second book.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I am using it just to copy slides and so far it is working very well.  I have not yet printed out any of the photos.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Written in the Nineties, but as relevant today.  Stephen King's practical, humorous and nicely self-revelatory writing guide/memoir went down easy, yet satisfied.  King doesn't need me to vouch for him as a writer, but I'll happily add him to the list of writer's writers.  Enjoy.  Then go write.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I liked this game but I think I liked rooms better. It makes you think logically and sequence your steps to solve and open the door.
1603427244|5.0|Perfect size to carry in knitting bag. Love the way it opens flat and stays there! She may have missed a couple of cast-ons and bind-offs but all the ones she included are well done.
0399157573|1.0|Kay Scarpetta has been everywhere ,done everything, and knows everything.  She thinks she knows what Marino, Benton, Lucy and everyone else around her is thinking.  It is getting old....<br />The book could have been written in 250 pages, without all of the unneccesary descripption and detail that really does nothing for the book, but tell you how full of herself Patricia Cornwell is.  I will never read another Patricia Cornwell book.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Another awesome book in the Michael Connelly tradition. He just continues to write a story so well and wraps everything up near the end. Great job Michael.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This is a great movie!  I caught myself laughing out loud a few times.  I have four kids and was trying to watch this on cable.  I had to hit pause so many times (for &#34;Mommy come here!&#34;)  that I lost about 15 minutes of the movie.  I went online and bought the prime account through amazon.  Well worth the couple of bucks I spent to see the 15 minutes of the movie I lost on cable. Nothing too deep, just a good, funny love story :)
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Love Lord of the Rings, you will love this movie too but I doubt I had to tell you that.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I picked this movie from the Prime Instant Movies andjust thought I would take a chance on it.  I could not believe how compelling this movie was.<br /><br />I sat and watched the whole movie without doing anything else.  I usually am playing on my computer when I watch movies but not with this one.<br /><br />It is not an action pack movie but it does have a very surprise ending at least for me.  I do not give any spoilers in my reviews of books and movies so I will not do it here.  So my advise is to see the movie and judge for yourself.<br /><br />I have watched the movie several time since I found it in Prime Instant Movie and will probably watch it more because it is that good.
0300197187|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone. Very clear and written in easy to understand jargon. We purchased it to add into our homeschool curriculum for our 10 year old. The book is a college level book apparently, which I wasn't aware of when purchasing. But when read aloud, our 10 year old understands the points we are trying to convey and is able to ask questions. Opens up lots of dialogue and critical thinking avenues. Love it.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|After listening to this, &#34;The Fifth Witness&#34;, on CD am I ever grateful for Harry Bosch.<br /><br />(This review is no reflection on the narrator who did his best with what he was given.)<br /><br />As I listened to this predictable and tedious book I kept telling myself ...just another few minutes and my interest will perk up. That never happened. Instead I stayed the course and will now end my trying to believe that just because the same author wrote both Harry Bosch novels...the Mickey Haller novels must be just as enthralling. NOT SO!<br /><br />I could have written the ending myself and that's not saying very much for this book or the author.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this book/CD. It's just doesn't have IT!<br /><br />I'll stay the course with Harry Bosch. He's worth it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|What did I think about Sentinel? I thought it was a really fitting end to a complex paranormal series about demi-gods, pures and half-bloods.<br /><br />Originally, I seriously didn't think the premise of this series was all that exciting when I saw it on JLA's website. I was trolling her website after finishing 3 of the Lux books back to back, jonesing for something else to read by her. Initially, I passed it up and read a couple of her new adult novels under her pen name, J. Lynn, instead. After finishing those equally fantastic reads, I had to give the Covenant series a try. I like how you can draw moral parallels from it with slavery and caste systems that we've seen in our very real human history. Having just seen the movie 12 Years A Slave (based on true events) on Thanksgiving Day, this final book really resonated with me.<br /><br />I started with book one instead of the prequel on the first read-through, and I immediately got drawn into Alex's world. Then starting in August, I even participated in a Covenant re-read hosted by Vi Nguyen from the Deity Island fansite that lead up to Sentinel's November 16th release party. Although I didn't get to attend the Philly release party, doing this re-read forced me to finally read the prequel and ramped up my excitement to read the final book.<br /><br />Everything comes to a head in this final book. Alex (2nd Apollyon) and Aiden (a sentinel Pure) and their band of fighters which includes the god Apollo have to figure out how to stop Seth (First Apollyon), Lucian (a power hungry Pure) and Ares (god of war) from bringing on the end of the world. Alex & Aiden enlist the help of Hades to reawaken a Titan who can help train the fighters to defeat Ares, the god of war, and therefore Lucian and his crazy plan to take over the world.<br /><br />In the past when there were 2 Apollyons at the same time, one had to transfer her/his power to the other and s/he becomes the Godkiller, a failsafe to keep balance in the world. The power transfer has always ended in the draining and therefore death of one of the two Apollyons. We already know that Seth awakened first and is addicted to the aether he can pull from Alex. This makes him a total ass to deal with in the preceding 2 books, but in Sentinel he realizes that he needs to be on Team Alex and has to transfer his power over to Ale, allowing her to become the Godkiller. He knows that Alex has more control. She proved that by breaking her bond with him in the previous novel. It’s the only way to defeat the powerful god of war, Ares and his army of half-bloods and mortal humans under compulsion.<br /><br />The good guys battle it out with Ares and his army of fighters. But in order to win, a surprising end is in store for Alex. I liked her end because it took me by surprise. It was realistic and bold on the author's part. Best of all, the deal Seth makes to ensure that Aiden gets to be with Alex after everything that happens, leaves a perfect opening for his own spin-off series.power transfer has always ended in the draining and therefore death of one of the two Apollyons.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|So far, I've loved all of her books......she's a very good writer & I can't stop reading once I start, but I force myself to....one night I read until 8:30 in the morning but I didn't realize I had been reading for that long....
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's the Avengers..  Fantastic movie.  Worth watching multiple times and buying is a great choice.  Digital Copy and DVD were nice additions.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is really good for me because I like music and this app allows me to choose any song I like and play it. You should get this app!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It has been a very long time time since I enjoyed a Grisham book.  This book had me involved from the beginning until the end.  Good story told well.  I will look forward to his next effort
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Although, Cornwell has taken our beloved Scarpetta and made her an unemotional zombie whose vocabulary requires a thesaurus.  Too bad, as Kay could be dependable for her unyielding devotion to the people who mattered most and that warmth transcended throughout the years consistently.  When I figured out what the murder weapon was before the bathroom scene and Kay, who the murderer was and what his familial ties were, I felt as though I was watching an old friend who had become so predictable.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|random title as usual anyways i was playing slenderman the arrival i beet it i play this and then i think i should review it and i nearly s*** myself because i turn around go to a room and everything is just...wow somehow i found NYAN CAT & JEFF THE KILLER IN THE SAME ROOM WTF????!!!! so im saying that if u think it u create it LITERALY NO JOKE  pease out ~~~~~~~> =3
B000002A46|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas cd's. Mariah's voice is so beautiful and she has all the classics on here, along with the fun stuff like &#34;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#34;, et ceterea.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works well with Kindle Fire, charges quickly and holds the charge way longer than I ever expect it to. Recommend to all.
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|Fantastic movie. The special effects were natural and believable The story is solid and the writers vision of the future seems sadistically realistic. I am happy to have a copy of it, I will be watching this again.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|I'm not really sure where to start with this review. I have been hesitant to start this book even after I absolutely fell in love with Before I Fall as I just wasn't buying the basic plot line and even after reading it I still don't buy it. There just isn't anything really presented in this story that makes me believe that a future where people are excitedly jumping in line to receive a lobotomy that will 'cure' them of emotion could ever exist. That in it's self is a huge problem because for a dystopian novel to work there needs to be a focus on world building. The reader needs to be convinced that at some point people thought this would be a good idea only to have it go horribly wrong and unfortunately that is something that this book is severely lacking.<br /><br />Oliver's writing in itself is very well done and part of my disappointment is that I know she is capable of writing a much better story. This entire book is lacking in any sort of suspense or even the littlest bit of excitement for what is going to happen next. Instead we're left with a long winded narrative of an absolutely normal plain girl, this point being shoved in our faces repeatedly, as she spends her last summer counting down the days until her procedure. Something we are to believe she wants even if everything she thinks or does says otherwise.<br /><br />She of course meets a guy who is later reveled to be uncured and the two fall in love and what follows is as cliched as the next YA romance. I think what bothered me the most is that they sneak out of the city into the wilds only to go BACK for Lena to decide she should just leave for good so they could be together...What?? Not to mention I hated the ending. It wasn't exciting it was just dumb and didn't really make much sense.<br /><br />Overall I would only recommend this for people that enjoy straight up teen romances as there isn't really much else happening in this book. I'll probably read the following books as I do like the author. I only hope something actually happens in the second.only hope something actually happens in the second.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I like the game a lot. The action and the graphics are very good. I like to sit with the game and play it all day that's how much fun it is.
B009RH9HDS|1.0|Kindle will not stay in the case. Don't bother buying this because you will want a refund. Too bad I can't give it 0 stars.
0805047905|5.0|My kids love this book. It rhymes so well. It is amazing how simple but enjoyable this is. My two year old girl cannot put it down and carries it with her everywhere she goes.
1250038820|5.0|Love Brandon, love the book, and I was thrilled to have gotten my book signed at his Barnes and Noble event.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Good guy, isn't really &#34;good.&#34; He was under the influence during the crash.  Quit agter something 'bad' happened. Hard to make a hero from thus kind of character.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Fun game for those who believe that they have what it takes to be the commander of the greatest army in history
B008JFURKG|5.0|This was a good compliment to the original movie.  It expanded the 4 main characters backgrounds and allowed them to show some more quirks to their already unique personalities.  If you liked the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker, you will see the expansion of the two of them as a couple and it is very funny.  John Malcovich is as usual excellent and Helen Mirren is so witty and classy as the MI6 sharpshooter assassin.  The new 4 &#34;bad guy?&#34; characters added just the right touch to a movie that is just about fun and super action sequences.  I hope they release a directors cut and hope there is more interaction with the Anthony Hopkins character.  He was so perfect in his role.  Then again when isn't he?
B009NF54ZE|3.0|It's a good game to if your bored and nothing else to do. Not every challenging though. For beginners of hidden puzzle this would be where I start.
0374531269|5.0|The honesty of the story made it difficult to put the book down. Despite the terrible and traumatizing events that were taking place, I was amazed to still see globalization at work. Although Ishmael Beah lived in an economically and culturally different place, his life, along with others, was impacted by things like rap and a fascination with new crapes. Globalization is also a catalyst for the spread of awareness about issues such as child soldiering. Coming from a feminist lens, it was not surprising to read that males, especially  the mentally and physically stronger ones, were preferred to fight in the war. Whether females were associated with rebels, the government army, or just civilians, they were always expected to be in the kitchen or tending to household duties. This story has opened my eyes to a conflict that I never thought too much about before. I have also began to question if rehabilitation centers really heal a child's emotional scars, or do they just hide them? Also, is there ways that a child soldier is more dangerous than an adult one? Reading this book affected my emotions and left me wanting to know more about child soldiering. I would definitely recommend it for globalization classes because, not only is it a compelling story, but it challenges you to think outside of the &#34;west vs. rest&#34; ideology.
B0000VD04M|5.0|There must have been something very appealing to Tim Burton about the career of film-maker Ed Wood.  Making a film about the supposedly worst film director certainly would allow considerable artistic license, for which Burton excels. However, when a film-maker makes a film about a film-maker, it would seem that the product would also be an essay on the creative process for this particular medium. In this regard , as well as the entertainment value, the film is a great success.<br /><br />The idea that Ed Wood was the worst film maker in Hollywood is probably unfair, and in fact in this film, he is shown as highly productive stretching every resource and producing vast amounts of work in a short period of time.  A fair judgment of Wood’s work would have to assess what was produced for what costs. In this regard he may be better evaluated than most.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film is the exploration of the ego of the artist. Was Wood and egotist?  Of course he was as was every artist who strives and produces. Without a clear vision the artist is adrift. Wood had to make considerable compromises due to lack of funds and living in a network of social influence and human frailty, but it is still possible to retain the artistic vision within these confines, in fact that is one criteria for the judgment of the artist; how true were they to developing and implementing a unique vision given the constraints of the time and resource in which they worked.  If this review sounds a bit academic and relates to art criticism, so what? It is as fair to judge this film based upon what it says about the artistic process as it is to judge the film based upon its entertainment value. In my opinion, both are very high in this film.<br /><br />Switching to a review of the entertainment value, it must be said that the performances of the main characters were superb, the art direction and attention to detail, and the soundtrack by Howard Shore were all excellent. Johnny Depp has theability to show on his face the ambiguities going on in his mind as he as to compromise, repeatedly, his artistic vision and the constraints placed upon him. Were Wood’s ideas of mixing transgenders, aliens, cowboys, and monsters really so farfetched?  I think not, after all when Picasso painted African masks on French prostitutes cubism was born. However, the most amazing dramatic performance in the film, as is universally acknowledged, is that of Marin Landau playing legendary Dracula actor Bela Lugosi.<br /><br />Overall this is an underestimated film that is both entertaining and acts as a sly commentary on the artistic process.
B004GXL8GC|5.0|Perfect! Loved that my kids got into smurfs just like I used to be and when i told my daughter I had a collection of figures like these some too. They are great and just what I wanted.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Had a lot of fun playing this with my 7yo grandson.  He loves this game!  We played on an HTC Flyer 7&#34; tablet, the graphics & animations were lots of fun.  It's not a scary game, just delightfully 'creepy.'
0765365278|5.0|This book has meant so much to me, and I recommend it almost constantly. It's got solid writing, a tight plot, amazing characterization, and a fun and involving world. Beyond that it has fantastic representation with an almost entirely non-white cast, well written women, not to mention good representation of mental illness.<br />This book helped me through some really rough times, and has been a fun read in good times. If diversity, strong character arcs, or giant magic crab beasts appeal, look no further.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is one of the most riveting and intense stories I have ever read.  God bless America and God bless the Navy SEALs.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a touching novel about a ten year old boy. August is his name. His face is disfigured. it's touching. I am sure you will cry happy  tears. Read a heartfelt bestselling book like wonder.you may be surprised. This is really quite a wonder. Try being in his shoes, or the other kids. They have POVS too. Enjoy! :)
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I received a cable that was clearly shorter than my 4' tall daughter - which when I wanted the 5' cable I ordered is just not right.  Sent an email with no response.  Still using it, but it wasn't what I wanted or needed.
B00G922EA2|4.0|it was a good.game lots of different things to do. the hint part was pretty good too. wasnt always the easyest to figure out tho. but over all it was a nice thinker of a game

B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is cool injustice is mind blowing just being so many characters like flash,catwomen,and more exciting characters, in the game
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Sweet tots and bacon knots this games more fun then a barrel of rum. If I could only play one game the rest of my<br /> days I'd play twisted, but if a second game was an option I'd play this.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Extremely we'll written and easy to understand in spite a lot technical information.  I immediately started putting his recommendations into practice and found immediate results.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a heart warming book. It shows how a family was able to survive the atrocities of war and never give up on the human race. The author draws you in and you become a part of the family. Very seldom do I comment on a book but this one was so touching that I had to comment.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|Disc arrived in good condition and i have enjoyed listening to the music. Would rather have a plastic jewel case but the paper sleeve works.
B001LM1456|2.0|I wasn't invested in Banner, I didn't care about Hulk. Liv Tyler simply stops any progress the film's made, and it never recovers.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great POV narration for a heart wrenching tale. The author weaves a tale that can surely be any child's formative years that grew up in Nazi Germany during WWII. Heart breaking moments, which reminded me a lot of Les Miserables (orphaned girl, growing up poor in politically dangerous times)<br />Highly recommended, with the warning; You will cry, and feel for Liesel as she survives day to day with her family and friends on Himmel street.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I bought this for my son, he is 10. He read the first six and loved them, I recommended it. It is a good item. Thank you.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|Sinister Gate's solos are awesome. I think he is one of the best guitarists out there. My only gripe is that the album doesn't flow as well as Nightmare did.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft! its soooooooo addicting! I can never stop playing it. I mean its not like its rotting to the brain. your building thing's!

B006NXIO0Q|4.0|I really liked this movie, a lot of action, kept me at the end of my seat and Zoe was believeable. 2 thumbs up, good story line also!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was a very good read.  I like that it started off where the last book left off.  It was easy to get into the book after the first chapter.
B008QLXSG8|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Sub themes sometimes very subtle and a little to philosophical for me but did not distract from the story. An attitude towards life which may have been appropriate to the time of the story but difficult to deal with!
B00A285OOW|5.0|This author has a way with words.  You can't wait to finish the book then it is over and you wish there was more to read.
B003Y7I0ZI|5.0|I've read some of it... its gonna be a great story bout a man I have much respect for. I've met Dave a couple times and he is such a cool dude. cant wait to see him again so he can autograph it for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am only twenty or so levels in but the game has already proved to be a challenge. They keep the levels fresh and seem to integrate nsw elements fairly often. Much fun. Wow.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't' put it down. Every chapter left me wanting more. Full of action and intrigue. Definitely a must read.
0375851569|5.0|Choosing this collection for my first grandchild an easy decision...Can't go wrong with Dr. Suess!  Every one should read them.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|Great little device for blue-toothing with a Nano Ipod. The company is great to work with in solving any hiccups in pairing as well !
0321200683|5.0|This is unbelievable but the book has been written ten years ago. Eight years are like a light year in IT and a lot of technologies are coming and going down during this period of time. I would recommend all software architects to read the book. The Title of the book maybe something else because integration topic cannot be solved just with massaging technology. There are other approaches like REST which is an important tool in integration projects.<br />This book describes more the two dozens patterns which are a great aid for all day problems in software architecture based on messing technology. The value of book can be seen when Apache foundation stated to adapt the notation and terminology of the book in Apache Camel. if authors describe some patterns implementations in more detail, then the book would be better in every aspect. 
B006JD48NM|5.0|Perfect gift for the Formula One fan out there. If your a big Senna Fan, this is a must to have. You'll be returning to watch this a lot !
0321127420|4.0|There is no doubt that Martin Fowler has a significant writing style. On the other hand we must remember that the book has been written in the year 2002 or earlier. The book is easy to  easy read and in every dimension.  At that time was not EJB specification not on the same level like today and<br />we had minimal experience with enterprise java application like today. Not to forget Spring framework has been in the concept phase other OR-mapping tool  were not on the same status like today. For sure some on the patterns in the book are obsolete but the as whole is  still useful to read.
B00BNUBK46|5.0|The light gives you the option of either a focused or wide beam.  As with all fenix products this item provides a quality and affordable option to more expensive headlamps that provide no better quality or performance.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was very interesting but there were parts that were slow.  This was different than a lot of Grisham's books.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle game. Easy to do and lots of puzzles to choose from. Love this game. Good for kids too.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Quick, easy read.  Feel good. Up lifting. Didn't want it to end. Be kinder than necessary. Wish there was a sequel.
0740797719|5.0|&#34;Color and Light&#34; is full of great images, but the author gives in-depth info on how to get the great effects and atmosphere in your own work. I find myself coming back to this book over and over. It is kind of an art course with so much useful teaching! Fun to look at, too!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My 5 year old absolutely loves this game...really good gameplay with great controls...one of the best free games available for download...do yourself a favor and download this game you will not be disappointed..
034580404X|5.0|Sent the books to my girlfriend and she loved them.  Sent me some hot pics too.  This is a must for any guy who wants his girl to be happy and have fun.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|I have waited 6 months to see this movie and I must say this is an incredibly amazing story I've seen in a while.  Both actors were magnificent especially Omar Sy.  Funny, funny, funy.  As fo Francois Cluzet, he also was magnifcent.  They should have been at nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globes, etc.  I know Omar Sy wn an award but they both should have won.  These two should do another movie together.  I sawthis movie through Netflix and before I returned the DVD I had already ordered my cpy from Amazon.  Thank you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Amazing game great graphics and and I love how the screen slows down when you kill something. It's great for dramatic affect!
B00GGEVKYO|5.0|I love Peter Jackson's Versions far better than the Studio Versions any day, it's like getting the Story he really meant and wanted to tell!  :-)
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent  movie.  Glad to have it as part of my collection.  I would recommend it highly to hose interested in WWII
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Awesome Action with Great Humor!  Very Interesting and funny!  Great Cast!  I was not an original Avengers Fan, but this one really got my attention and interest!  What is interesting is they have no super powers or abilities, yet they achieve much.  I like a more human side to the Avengers story.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works on my Kindle fire and HD. Easy to use, can setup more than one alarm, can set the alarm to ring on a particular day of the week. You can also choose the music from you music library to wake up to and not be limited to just the built in tones.
B0054PSY2W|4.0|This is a classic.  I had watched it a long time ago but wanted to have it for my library.  If you never watched it, you should.  At least once.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I loved it and you will to!
B00BNWWUDY|1.0|This was so bad, I turned it off half way through.  I mean, it was awful:  the acting, horrible story, nothing about it worth a nickel.  Don't waste your money.
0205313426|4.0|This is a on authoritative and timeless little grammar book which is very useful to those of us ego still care about writing correctly.
B00D3LA71K|2.0|This isn't a very good movie.  I was very disappointed consdering that Matthew McConaughey is the star.  The story line is poor.  If you want to watch it, go  to the dollar movie.  It sure isn't worth any more.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|I love the first movie because it was down to my almost 3 year old level. So I was excited about this one. Don't get me wrong its a good movie but this one is not for her level. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|not that good.  barely believable.  do not waste your money.  readable as always, just not emotionally engaging.  enough said.<br /> en
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i like it but it would be better if it was not so expensive to buy another horse to train
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Non-stop action and emotional drama. Thank you for a beautiful story.  Thank you Markus Zusak for The  . Book Thief. Dolores
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|Not his best or his worst effort. Lilkely to be made into a sequel move for 'A Time to Kill'
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Same thing as subway surfer guide it would not start on the kindle fire.  My son like to play this game but for some reason it will not work on the kindle fire!
0374531269|5.0|A long way gone: Memoirs of a boy soldier is the true story of a boy named Ishmale Beah's life in Sierra Leone. His childhood wasn't smooth like other kids out there; he lost his parents and other family members at the age of 12. He would do anything just to keep away from the war and being caught by the RUF. At the early age instead of enjoying his childhood without any worries he got forced to handle guns to kill other people. With the globalized and feminist lens shape my reading of this book I would say that this story is heartbreaking and hardly conceivable. This book includes of torturing, raping, and has many incredibly sad feeling of Beah's family lost. The question that comes to mind is how could an innocent little boy can withstand the damage of the flesh and spirit? This is the second incredible book based on a true story that I've ever read. I highly recommend this book for future classes on globalization because this book will bring many details of the war in Sierra Leone has back then that you haven't known yet.  Nevertheless, it also shows the dangers of globalization in a personal context. Which making the story of a personal life looks more real than distancing from the real offset of globalization.
B008MILL9G|4.0|The ocean's trilogy for cheap..<br /><br />11 is pretty good (better than the original with the rat pack).  The 12 and 13 are just sequel with all you expected from money making sequel movies...
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love it!  All of the songs are AMAZING!  Not one song I did not like!  I would highly recommend this!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I thought this would be more versatile than what it is.  You can watch movies through your computer wirelessly but you have to do it through chrome.
B00594XOZU|5.0|ive been waiting for this appp since freakin the firt of september because of school and people only have kiks now days no more phones just ipod touches and kik lol;b
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|We have the free version and I'm not sure what is missing but it is very cute and easy to play. My favorite part is when the animals have their produce and are leaving - my sweet grand baby waves bye-bye to them. She can do almost everything herself and she is not quite two. The first few times we helped and we continue to sit with her (mainly to protect our kindle!)
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Approximately 1out of every 3-5 games is a real winner. Twin Moons is one of G5's. Makes you think; plenty of puzzles; lots of extras (such as finding the 21 rings).  Big Fish and G5 are the only game co.'s that provide really excellent Android games and I am thankful for them, even if it is only 1 out of 3-5.
B00GTZN0X4|2.0|Ordered HD, but it was not. The picture was blurry and the movie froze about 30 minutes into it. This is the same system that we use to watch NetFlix and we never have this problem with it.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|The Beatles BBC 2 is classic raw music recorded live at the BBC studios with an inside look of their humor and wit.
030758836X|2.0|I had read the reviews here and ordered the book from Amazon with great excitement. Nonetheless, the excitement was short-lived. The plot is banal and was too obvious after a few pages and particularly I was not quite impressed with the author's writing style. I suppose this informal kind of writing style was done deliberately. I didn't find it appealing and I may be the only one who is complaining.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Always have loved them, best concert I've ever been to, the energy was awesome, everyone was dancing! This has their best.
B00870ZH3U|2.0|This Opera did not make it. It was such a flop in my opinion. The music was okay but a bit second rate and the acting wasn't impressive. I did not care for any of the actors playing any of the parts. I feel sorry for Webber going out on this really poor job but truth is truth, but it's only my opinion. He won't ever be able to out-do the first POTO. The scenery was creepy and the mirrored circus made me laugh. Sorry LVD fans, could't help sayin' it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I just started and it's really fun, if you like superheroes then it's the game for you, I've been waiting for it to come out on the Kindle
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It is very easy at first.  However it gets harder as you progress.  I am stuck at level 70, and I don,t seem to be able to skip it.  I would gladly pay just to skip it.
B003B02O0A|2.0|A good storyline and consequent movie script. However, It is disorganized, repetitive and rambling, could have cut a third of the content. This was a first book that could not find a publisher until the success of subsequent work and that work has been very good.<br /><br />I will never understand why great fictional authors take their time and ours to develop and integrate important characters and then ignore them through the conclusion. Cheers!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A very good read, enganging story and great language use. It's fairly easy to read, but still thrilling and engaging, very hard to put down! As a Teacher Of English as a Foreign Language, I've suggested this book for a number of my pupils (ages 14 and up), it's my impression they enjoyed it as much as I did.

B000SEFCD8|4.0|Excellent resource and reference for better understanding of all of our dogs. We learned quite a bit of new information on sharing our lives with our four legged furry friends.... our dogs. Would have loved more in-depth knowledge about under-dogs who fight against the pack leader. Overall an enjoyable read containing wonderful information
1451629192|5.0|This is an exellent book that looks into the life of the abused and the pain caused by the abuser..<br />It brings light to an abusers dark world, and exposure is the best remedy for people to be aware of this problem. .<br />This book is insightful in helping others that may be going through some type of abusive situtation where manulipution,fear and guilt are the main tools used to gain control.. ...<br />.In todays world this book is more timely than some would like to admit and I recommend it for its telling story. .  .

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the movie actors and action. Jennifer Lawrence was magnificent and the realistic action was very good. Try it, I guarantee you will like it.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I think this game is a fun mind bending physics based game. (hint turn your kindle and gravity will change ;)  ) This game defiantly has helped me pass time also.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|Cute graphics and fun gameplay. Great if you like village building games and fantasy rpgs. Only just started but there seems to be a lot to do.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I am not into Science fiction but this movie was excellent in that they included the actual sailors from the Battleship's of the past. I get teary eyed and choked up every time I see that part of the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is good and I think it is a great game. I really enjoy it a lot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun but it's hard after awhile. Plz play wand try to enjoy it like me.even my little girl likes to play this game........
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Great game...... but when u install it on 2. Different devices it won't let u in one of them.. So when u want to use it tablet/kindle for the ham  instead of phone it doesn't load on the table/kindle... I even reinstalled it several times still didn't fix problem..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very frustratingly addictive. I am having fun but the minion doesn't always respond. I will prevail. You must really like the color yellow with all the bananas.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Formulaic, predictable, and perhaps a little crude stylistically, but it works.  Unabashedly written for MMO geeks and gamers, I think it works very well and should hold up well for anyone with those interests.  I'm assuming there will be a sequel, and I'll be waiting to read it.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The game was fun. Had problems with note book freezing and had to shut down several times to get working, other then that it was good. When is the second one coming out ? Wanted to try the Sneak preview but it would not open.thanks
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Powerful, disturbing and one of Grisham`s best. I went to work sleep deprived as I could not  stop reading until I finished, then I was sorry it was over. I feel vested in the characters lives and want more.
B00GDAOYTE|5.0|I love this app and its so easy to use that even I can do it thank you I'm having a blast with this one!
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This was a hilarious fun to watch movie. We really enjoyed watching the events as they unfold in the lives of a made up family.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Can't play the game without buying lives or waiting forever.  Candy Crash (Pop Star), which is no longer available I guess, is 10 times more fun and isn't just trying to take your money. I'd gladly pay for a game I can play instead of getting one free that I can't!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I just don't get it. These films do not follow the established history of Star Trek at all. All glitter and no substance at all. Just not worth it.
B00555X8OA|5.0|If you've ever wondered why you did something that made no sense afterwards...<br /><br />If you've ever presented what you thought was a logical and rational argument, only to get no reaction...<br /><br />If you are still looking for the user manual for the human mind...<br /><br />If you puzzle over why you are so good at buying high and selling low...<br /><br />Thinking, Fast and Slow may just be the book for you. This book gets 10 stars out of 5.<br /><br />As in quantum mechanics, what we learn about the hidden nature of things is often counter-intuitive - but that's a major point of the book.<br /><br />We humans plainly don't think nearly as logically as we imagine we do, even if we believe we are more rational than most, and smarter than the average bear. We are plagued with cognitive illusions, most or all of which we are unaware. We are susceptible to being seriously influenced in our thinking merely by the order or wording of things that are presented to us. Sure, you may say, everyone knows that. But we might not know it as well as we thought we did, and this book is likely to change significantly the way we look at life.<br /><br />Buy this book. I'm 90% certain you won't regret it. My System 1 says so!
2061011306|5.0|This map hangs in the hallway. It is large but SO NICE to have a handy reference to check weather events (snow storms, earthquakes), football game locations, Interstate highways are well marked, mountain ranges, etc etc. It's nice to 'finger' a site, rather than 'google' it, giving you a clearer frame of reference.
1465414444|4.0|DK puts out some fantastic books.  The books are always ruggedly constructed and have wonderful illustrations.<br /><br />This book is no exception.  For fans of World of Warcraft (WoW), you will recognize most if not all of the artwork.<br /><br />It is a bit of a survey book.  That is almost unavoidable though, because there is a lot of material.  You could probably do a five volume set of books this size and still not cover all of the existing WoW lore.<br /><br />The book covers the current WoW canon (that has changed a great deal over the past ten years), but gives a nod to areas where the WoW lore changed significantly over the years.<br /><br />There were a few things that I wondered about, but I have faith that DK got the lore right.<br /><br />One of the coolest things about this book is that you can tell that this was done by folks who were fans of WoW.<br /><br />The world and its denizens are treated with great respect.<br /><br />You could not play WoW just by reading this book, but you could learn enough that you would want to learn more.<br /><br />It appears that Blizzard is pulling away a bit from WoW.  There are several follow-on games in the works, currently in Beta.  So, this might be the perfect time to have a retrospective look at phenomenon that has become part of popular culture.<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Definately reccommend this game. Great visuals and easy gameplay.  Pretty fun game.  Easy to play and no extra money required!!!!!
0375842209|5.0|Starts a little slow, but sticking with it is well worth it…touching ending!  Once Liesel begins reading in the bomb shelters, the book really takes off and is a page turner.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I like this game a lot.<br />This game is easy to play but watch out for the lasers. You can buy new jet packs and clothes for the guy. You can kill the small guys with some of the jet packs.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|classic with great story, interesting characters and amazing view into history. The special effects with historical footage is amazing.<br />If you've not seen it in awhile, time to watch it again.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|As always, AFI has put out another incredible album!<br />Davey Havok's voice is incredible!<br />Can't wait for them to tour in my city again!!
0345529057|5.0|Love it but book 4 is a drag and a half. could skip 4 all together. yup skip four really
B002SEW5WW|5.0|One Republic is a great band that I've recently discovered. I love all of their albums! I hope to see them live some day.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|This thing is okay at best.  The video quality isn't all that great.  It eats the battery.  It sometimes errors out and has to be removed and put back on.  The touch screen can also be finicky.<br /><br />Worst of all, GoPro upgraded their App a couple months after I bought this, adding the functionality this could do that the App previously couldn't.  Now I can use my iPhone for the same uses as the LCD (other than in dirty/wet situations, which I never really use the BacPac anyway.<br /><br />It went from an essential item to a nice to have.
0307739961|5.0|This whole series was fantastic. It's such a shame that this wonderful author is no longer with us to write more great stories.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The ONLY reason this gets 2 stars is because of the price.  If it were more expensive, this would be a 1 star item.<br /><br />There is a lot to complain about:<br /><br />- Tab casting is nice (though a bit flaky at times).  Too bad I can't tab cast off of my tablet or phone, which is what I really want to do with this.<br /><br />-  Can't power itself off the HDMI (yes, I hooked to a 1.4a device, still had to use USB).  Luckily there is always something around with an open USB port so I didn't have to plug it into the wall.<br /><br />-  Google killed local streaming.  No tab casting on mobile browsers + no local streaming anymore killed 80% of its use.<br /><br />-  No Amazon Prime streaming app, only can be done through tab casting.  Crap.<br /><br />-  The Chromecast App is a freaking joke; just a setup App.<br /><br />Such a limited device - I'd rather spend a little more on a much more capable device (which I have). I have an Apple TV 3, PS3 and Roku 2 XS...devices that are all far more powerful/useful than the Chromecast.  I downgraded the Chromecast to our TV in the loft that rarely gets turned on, just so I'd have something I could stream to there.<br /><br />My hope is that Google will get their software together and make this a better device because right now it just sucks<br /><br />Edit:<br />Months later and I'm downgrading to 1 star.  What a piece of junk.  We started using Netflix streaming and boy what a POS it is on the Chromecast.  Takes forever to load and random buffering.<br /><br />Before I get blamed on my ISP / Wireless network, I have no issues streaming Netflix on my iOS Devices, Apple TV 3, PS3 and Roku 2 XS.  ONLY on the POS Chromecast.  It shows full wireless signal bars on it.  I tried with and without the extension dongle.  My wireless network is very robust (using a Linksys E4200 V2 router, not some cheap POS).  No overlapping wireless signals in the area as our homes are spread apart pretty far and inSSIDer found nothing in the area.  Unplugged all 2.4 devices that could interfere - and again, NONE of my other wireless devices have problems, only the stupid Chromecast.<br /><br />Don't buy this junk.  It may be cheap but if it barely works why bother?
B002TVQ4HG|1.0|My rating is a bit unfair, perhaps, because I don't like horror movies and was induced to watch this one solely because it is a time travel movie (which I analyzed at [...] for time travel fans).  It ultimately was a disaster of a time travel story, using a temporal loop to create the horror of an inescapable situation, and doing so badly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of Stephen King’s best and well known books was undoubtably 1977’s The Shining.  A lot of the longevity of its popularity is due to the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film, which stands out as one of the best horror films of all time (although some diehards, including King himself, didn’t like the movie because it was “different”.  Whatever).  So it really isn’t a surprise that King decided to pen a sequel, or rather a follow-up, 36 years later.<br /><br />I remember watching the movie all those years ago with my mother.  I distinctly remember Mom stating at the end of the film, after Wendy and Danny escaped the hotel, “Well.  THOSE two are going to be scarred for life….”  That’s probably true for any character in a Stephen King book at the end of the story, but in this case, it’s a treat to get to see little Danny Torrence grow up. That’s not to say the experience is pleasant. There are too many demons (literally) in this boy’s past.  So normalcy is not going to come easy.<br /><br />This book actually has about three acts.  Act one follows Danny and his mom Wendy shortly after they make their escape and are trying to live as best they can down in Florida.  The chef from the (now burned down) Overlook Hotel, Dick Halloran is called in to help Danny deal with some horrible things that only these two can really understand.  Act two jumps to when Danny (now Dan) is in his early twenties, and is already a hopeless alcoholic just like his father.  It seems alcohol is the only thing that can stop the Shine.  So Dan basically drinks his young life away - losing job after job, getting battered and bruised in bar fights, and spending many nights with women that you wouldn’t exactly want to take home to meet the family.<br /><br />Act three is where our story really starts.  We’re now in the present day, and Dan has his turbulent past mostly under control.  With the help of AA, he stays sober and finds a job working as an orderly at a Hospice.  Dan can now finally use his Shine for good.  He’s able to know when patients are about to die, and spends the last few minutes of their life with them, giving comfort as they move on to the next level of existence.  Here is where the monicker “Doctor Sleep” comes into place.  Ironically, though, this really doesn’t play too heavy of a role in the overall story.<br /><br />We then meet a young girl named Abra, who lives a few hundred miles away.  Like Dan, she has the Shine as well.  Also, like Dan, the Shine is “strong in her”.  So strong that there are some that want her.  No…they need her.  I’m speaking of the evil entities that are in place in this story.  Their name is the True Knot.  They’re a band of ghosts/vampire like beings.  They’ve actually lived for hundreds (and thousands) of years.  They masquerade themselves by driving around the country in large winnebago caravans, and manage to “fit in” as  tourists from all over the country.  Like vampires that need blood to survive, the True Knot needs “steam” from small children who have the Shine.  They must find these children and kill (torture, really) them and feed off their “steam”.  Since all of these characters have some sort of psychic abilities, everyone kind of “knows” what’s going on.  Abra knows she’s in trouble, and the True Knot KNOWS she knows in trouble, etc. etc.  So Abra “reaches out” to Dan - a man she knows because of the Shine, but has never met.  Dan steps in, and the hunt is on.  He must save Abra from the True Knot that need Abra for her “steam”.<br /><br />In many ways, you can see the roles of everyone mirroring some of the key characters from The Shining.  Abra is obviously the new Danny, and grown up Danny, in many ways, resembles the Dick Halloran character as he helps young Abra.  The True Knot resembles the ghosts and ghouls from the Overlook Hotel.  Sadly, this is one area where this book falls a bit short of its predecessor.  A bunch of middle-aged tourist looking people simply can’t hold a candle to the empty, scary hallways of the creepy Overlook.  You have to remember, however, that the True Knot needs to blend in with their surroundings, so they can’t exactly run around the country looking like a bunch of Nosferatus.<br /><br />In fact, this book really isn’t that scary at all.  Contrary to what most people think, though, Stephen King hasn’t written that many scary books.  Strange?  Yes.  Bizarre? Definitely.  So I wasn’t disappointed that this story, unlike The Shining, didn’t force me to sleep with a night light.  In fact, I loved it.  I thought it was very suspenseful, and couldn’t wait to find out what happened next.  The climax of the fates of the main characters was a bit weak, but I kept on turning pages, and anytime I can complete a 530 page book in 3 days, it usually means it has to be good.<br /><br />It was nice to “visit” the Overlook again.ddle-aged tourist looking people simply can’t hold a candle to the empty, scary hallways of the creepy Overlook.

1577314808|5.0|Love this book, have probably boughten at least 4 of them for myself, family and friends.  Read The New Earth first, and went back for this one,  Life changing for me.  Wish I could say the same for those I bought one for...  But there is always tomorrow.  Very fast shipping.
B00CM9JIZ0|5.0|Queensrÿche is reborn. This is new yet honors the QR sound that we loved in the first place. Todd has a phenomenal vocal range. This will definitely be a top 10 album of the year.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought it would be a downer, but it isn't.  The author has a real talent for chapter development.  And I learned a lot, too!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a window to the lives of those impacted by Hitler. Unbelievable how people survived such inhumanity. Of course, many did not, as this book reflects.  When will we learn?
B0053IOZBE|5.0|Great price but also a good movie. I hope that they continue to put this series into movie format. It has been a great series.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|This game is like clash of clans but a differant version i think that if you like strategy games then you will like this game and the campaign is fun it makes you think of a differant strategy each time but its not a game were you can control your units when your done placing them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great series thus far and I am looking forward to enjoying reading the rest of the series and the author did a wonderful job putting this book together.
B001EBWIPE|4.0|Great story line and love seeing all the great props.  Great set with lots of memories of those of us that lived in the 40's.  I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a trip back in time.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Wanna have a whole bunch of fun time silly magic? No? Well then don't you go playing candy crush saga! Cause a silly fun and sweet treat time you would have if you did. Ummm did I just crush with my choppers a tasty kidney bean?<br />Hmmmm...kidneys!
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie reminds me of life in North Korea, where all the privileged live in the big city, Pyongyang and bring in the slaves from the countryside for sport.  I especially like the lighting and methods used to colorize various different parts of the movie.
0307719219|5.0|This is an excellent book and Daron Acemoglu builds his thesis from the first page. I have to say this book has changed my view on what is important for each country to develop in order to create a truly great society.
B00GRPD0J0|1.0|Crashes upon opening. Couldn't use. Hopefully it will get better.  The app on my ipad works but not this one for my fire.
0345803485|5.0|Absolutely excellent book - a nail-biting read which gets your gears moving!  I loved the entire series and cannot wait for the movie.  Great quality of book materials.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Takes forever for the pictures to load if they ever do. The one for ipad works better.  Very slow to refresh also.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|It takes a small bit of getting used to,but it isn't difficult (of course, I am only on the first level........).  It's fun!
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|You got to release more of these games!!!  At least a couple a month.  I like to have another loaded and ready while I'm playing one.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It has way better graphics but the only thing that I completely hate about this game is super stupid I'm just giving you a warning is dont upgrade your shotgun write after you get it is because I haven't even gotten to the 4 level.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Wonderful app. Very easy to use. Does everything it says it will in a very<br />user friendly way. Would recommend to anyone!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Fascinating read!  Love the \\"Russian doll\\" concept.  Mr. Mitchell's interpretation of repeatedly reborn souls is so intriguing, I feel this could be a factual record, rather than fictional.  Incidentally, I saw the movie first, which is unusual for me.  Had to watch it twice to grasp the accents and futuristic language style, which wouldn't have been necessary reading the book. I know it changed my initial perceptions of the characters and settings, but the stories are so strong, it didn't matter to me.  I highly recommend this book's unique experience.
B004AM5BTY|1.0|Kindle version has no table of contents and no annotations which are available on free versions. Regardless of what people say about the hardcover version this version is useless. Amazon should segregate the reviews of the formats if the e-version is completely different like this. Very dissatisfied.
0596004966|5.0|Great product.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great programming.  Season 3 is great.  I have really enjoyed watching all seasons in Amazon instant Video and looking forward to Season 4.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I like it. It really makes a good light when you need one. I think it pulls a lot from the battery, but it not like you are going to have it on for long periods.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Unlike many of the reviewers, I will speak of what's I know.  Jerry.  Case closed. This is an awesome album, jerry is on fire,  as to the comment about the singers. They are wonderful,  I saw probably about twenty five or so solo shows spread out over roughly twenty five years. All were good, some nice, a few transcendent.  This is a nice sample of late period jerry,  we all get older. Deal with it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Terrific story and great drama. Grisham once again weaves a wonderful story that is just impossible to put down. Only a matter of time before Hollywood produces the movie.
B00H57OXSG|5.0|Allen is evolving and ageing superbly, portraying intense characters and vivid but realistic situations. He confirms in Blue Jasmine his great vein for narration, and the unique skill of being able to merge comedy and drama like no other, and perhaps better than ever before. In fact this movie is a continuous push and pull of emotions, where every moment is masterly planned and balanced.<br />Blue Jasmine is an elegant modern day tale about a Park Avenue woman who is unable to cope with reality. Whether in the pretentious and comfortable life of New York's high society alongside her rich husband and friends, whether in a simple life in San Francisco trying to start over, Jasmine seems to be addicted to denial and evades every bit of truth about her life, absolutely unable to take up any responsibility.<br />The cast is high profile and just perfect. They all deliver a superior performance, and Cate Blanchett is simply phenomenal.<br />The script is very well written and the movie majestically directed. The usual great soundtrack rounds this to a definite 5* in my book.
B00CO4GO7I|2.0|This &#34;memorial&#34; edition seems almost cartoonish and rushed into print while the notoriety<br />of sniper Chris Kyle and friend Chad Littlefield bizarre handgun deaths at the hand of<br />another veteran suffering from PTSD is still prominent in the public's mind. Too much of<br />the last part of the book is devoted to friends and acquaintances memorializing Chris, so<br />we do not get a balanced picture of his short life.
B000059TEQ|5.0|Great love story.  The fashion and style of the time is also amazon.  70's preppy, which is a classic.  Most of the things Ali wears, I would wear today in a heart beat.  A tear jerker.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Another good Grisham lawyer read. However Jake Brigance (the attorney) and his wife Carla fade into the Confederate jasmine wallpaper a bit in this novel. Minor characters, like the improbably named Memphis trash attorney Booker Sistrunk, step forward to enliven the plot (reminding us of Johnny Cochran). The plot evolves around a suicide where the deceased hung himself from one of the sweet smelling trees known as the sycamore (many were originally planted in a row) but not before writing a new will that disinherits his blood family and leaves the majority of a $20 million dollar estate to his cleaning maid, who assisted him especially when he was badly stricken with terminal cancer. Since the plot takes place in Mississippi, it is easy for the reader to color each character black or white, which sets the racial stage for another improbable verdict.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it, however, its more of a &#34;look what I can do&#34; rather than, &#34;must have&#34; Using this with my Nexus7 (2012) and HTC One S. The HTC One S responds better to sharing than the Nexus does. Go figure. When using netflix, I must wait a long time before the sharing icon is displayed. The HTC One S shows up right away.<br /><br />The wifi is less than stellar on the Chromecast; if you are using it in an area where wifi is low (weak signal), I would probably say good luck as it is hit or miss. Other than than the set up per use time, it is pretty cool.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Farming and fighting, at a pace that keeps you interested. Someone said it was relaxing, and that is very true.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As good as his first book, A TRime To Kill. In between books not as good.<br /><br />Race is very important  in this book.

1881273873|5.0|quick and easy to read.  This book helped me to really think about<br />my relationships with people.  You can really see people respond<br />when you communicate with them in their love language.  Nicely<br />written.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|With good graphics and lots of opportunity for extras, Candy Crush keeps me entertained and wanting to keep going to complete each level. He variety of challenges is also great for honking and problem solving.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Yep, plays Freecell in a clean orderly manner.  No extras or frills to get in the way.  A good recommendation.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It made the whole series pointless! What a retarded way to end a series.  I will NEVER read another book written by Veronica Roth again.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was an amazing ending to a trilogy I loved, I felt truly connected to the characters and the ending shocked me the most!
0345803485|1.0|stupid boring over hyped book, never got past chapter three, gave it to my wife, she felt the same way, probably the only reason it sells, is all the hype about it, and most people fell for the hype
B001IF277K|5.0|Great replacement battery. Very affordable.  Didn't want to go with sony battery as we had washed the phone and didn't know if replacing battery would work
B0084TWN9K|2.0|Bought it because she won the Nobel Prize. Definitely not my favorite.  I did not like her female characters at all.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|(Spoiler Alert) One of the best of all times. I used to watch this movie a lot and I loved it so much that I named my daughter Beatrix after Beatrix Kiddo. Fights are awesome, exagerated blood every where, limbs juping out of bodies, so nice picture.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all three books out of curiousness of all the hype. The writing isn't great, but I had heard that before I started & didn't have high expectations. Still, I couldn't put the books down & read through the series in 2 weeks. The first book is actually the worst of the 3. The story gets a little more active & intense in the 2nd & 3rd books, though, so If you start, I'd recommend that you at least finish.
0679720200|3.0|The Stranger is about a man named Meursanlt, and life in Algiers. The book starts off with him going to his moms old persons home. His mother had just passed away and they are planning a funeral for her. Then he meets a co-worker at the beach they start talking and become really good friends. It seems like he is starting to fall in love with her, but he is unclear about it. One day they are hanging out with some friends when he notices a few Arabs follow them. The Arabs attack them and he shoots one of them 4 times. He is charged with murder and set to jail. He explains all of the mental sadness when you are in jail and how it has to be fought off.<br /><br />Someone who would like this book is a person who likes books that become very suspenseful and outcome that is not expected happened. For example he goes to confront the people who are fallowing him and you think there may be a fight but he ends up killing him in cold blood. This action sets up the whole book. There is this them that deep love is always stronger than a few mistakes. The main character has this girlfriend before he goes into jail then after he goes in he thinks that there relationship is over, but she visits him and said when he gets out they should get married.<br /><br />This book goes into very deep detail as if Albert Camus is actually the stranger it almost seems like it would be a non fiction piece yet it is a fictional book. He also rights in first person witch makes it seem even more that he would be the stranger. Albert Camus has a strange stile witch makes some parts make you want to fall asleep but at others you can not put it down because so many things are going on. It makes it seem more powerful when he does this because you are not expecting anything to happen then something always does. Some parts of the middle are very uneventful and it makes it seem like book will not pick up. This mostly happens when he is talking about his daily life.<br /><br />Over all I would recommend thisbook to one of my friends. I enjoyed it. I would give it about a 6.5 out of a 10-point scale. I would give it a 7 or 8 if the slow parts were shorter or had a little bit more going on in them.

B009W6OXB0|2.0|Musically, this is a wonderful album by Bruno Mars. Great songs, interesting production, and an overall feeling of positivism. So I'm rating the music 4 stars. I gave my purchase two stars because the album came in warped. I have to put a nickel on the needle to prevent it from skipping!
B004PR71JC|5.0|Great music to move and sing to. If you keep still while this is playing I would be surprised! The lyrics in most of the songs are terrific and the kids really enjoy it too!
1451613520|5.0|Excellent history of US that is easy to read, chock full of details and information told from a perspective we do not otherwise learn in school. Rather than history written from the perspective of &#34;victor&#34; (the &#34;special interest groups&#34; that came out on top, often by controlling the state), it is written from a perspective of the &#34;loser&#34; (U.S. interests that failed to emerge victorious from inter-group rivalries) and from the rest of the world. Delionizes U.S. leaders and their policies.
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|Despite what others say... this is not a bad album.  The trouble is, we are always comparing each Boston LP to their best and to the one etched in our early memories.  It's hard for any musician to beat their best. Will McCartney ever write another &#34;Hey Jude?&#34; Will Styx ever produce another &#34;Grand Illusion?&#34; Even Beethoven would have a hard time satisfying modern crowds after he did his 5th symphony.<br />I listened to the whole CD today while I jogged. You're right... it's not the Boston most of us expected after 10 years. We know Sholtz has some rock and roll in him, but apparently this is where he is right now.<br />The music is good. It's not &#34;More Than a Feeling.&#34; If this were some other band, it might be one of their better efforts... but we expect so much from Boston. They reached that mythical status from our youth. It'd be hard to find anyone to live up to those standards.<br />Let's hope Sholtz and  a new Boston band can bring another album to us soon.. much sooner than 10 years. He still has it in him. You can hear it in this album.... waiting.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|Cute popcorn entertainment. I wouldn't call this a great movie or even a must-see, but it's entertaining enough to make me want to see it a second time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I shall forever miss the hours that I lost to this book. Horribly written. HORRIBLE role model for young women. If you are looking for erotica, there are much better books out there. I bought it because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I still haven't figured that out.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|A groundbreaking and iconic book that still powerful today.  Brown's approach humanizes the Native American story in a way few others have.  Simple, personal, and tragic.
B005LAII80|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Please do not confuse it with the cheesy Judge Dredd movie made in the heyday of cheesy action films.  Karl Urban brings the Dredd role to life and lends it the gravity you would expect from canon.
B000006TSC|5.0|Because they simply can't!<br />This is one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard - it actually makes a nice pairing with Raindances, they could be two parts of a double album.<br />I first heard these back in 1979. When things get tough, I listen to these, and I realize things ain't so bad.<br />Other people who don't get it - well, my sympathy, your loss.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting theory. Don't have any sense of validity or reliability. Have found not eating gluten to be helpful in terms of craving carbs. That alone is worth a good deal to me. Will be interest in others' reviews.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all three books out of curiousness of all the hype. The writing isn't great, but I had heard that before I started & didn't have high expectations. Still, I couldn't put the books down & read through the series in 2 weeks. The first book is actually the worst of the 3. The story gets a little more active & intense in the 2nd & 3rd books, though, so If you start, I'd recommend that you at least finish.
1416955070|1.0|Half-way through. Still waiting for it to get good. If you are looking for the draw of the Hunger Games or the Maze Runner, this is NOT it.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Fans of Pendergast will indeed love this latest drama involving Corrie Swanson. Lots of intrigue and drama ensue!! Pendergast, the rogue FBI agent has indeed outdone himself again!!
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Wow! I just love the whole three series. They are a great exposé of the life in roman times. The explicit violence, the explicit sex are simply superb! Just watch all three seasons in a row and enjoy them!
B00DVPN30A|5.0|I have all the previous Amos Lee CD's and this is by far my favorite yet.  I recently saw him in concert.....great show!
B004TACMZ8|4.0|I gave the Bosch scanner 4 stars because it does work decent for the most part depending on where I am in my home. But I think I would have given it 2 or 3 if I was reviewing it on only finding studs - especially in my garage where I know almost exactly where many of them are already and it is off enough to make you possibly miss the stud if you were going off its reading.<br /><br />I think I have more stud finders than just about anyone and they all have their pro's and cons and &#34;sorta&#34; work depending on the application. I guess I am just determined to find one that works for all applications and it seems some come close (like this one) and others are plain crap.<br /><br />Honestly the last one I bought before this (can't remember the name but it's sold on Amazon) was basically a set of 4 yellow plastic covered magnets and they work perfectly at finding the studs - how funny (but obvious) is that? That set was something like $5 - $10 I think and it blows away most all electronic models I have when doing the basic task of locating studs.<br /><br />I have watched several reviews of this scanner and it seems to work well with the various types of scanning it can do although I cannot comment on those as I have yet to try them in an actual situation other than scanning areas I know have power going to them for example and it does recognize there is power behind the wall in that area.
B000FC11A6|5.0|See Full review on my blog: Terrebrate<br /><br />The author, Neal Stephenson, describes a story that is set around the intersection between the discovery of world-changing math insights and the incipient designs of our computer science founding fathers. Stephenson delights in explaining how all of these things go together. His collection of fictional and nonfictional characters orbits each other across a thousand pages and propels the reader through dual timelines of World War II and the dot-com startup decade of the 1990s. The result is a multigenerational treasure hunt worthy of an Indiana Jones adventure, but unlike Indiana Jones, this is not a light read. It is dense with ideas. You do not skim through this looking for the good parts, but if you take the time to savor the journey, you will not be disappointed. You will be fed cyber security history, rollicking adventure, heartbreaking tragedy, the pleasures and perils of a multigenerational family, and the awkwardness of several geek love stories all told from the hacker perspective. There is something for everyone here, and you owe yourself the pleasure of finding your favorite part. In other words, it is part of the canon. You should have read this by now.
B00EDY5KTA|4.0|I'd give it a five star rating, but color me unimpressed with Demi Lovato's version of 'Let it Go' - it's Idina's song, it'd be like slapping a new version of 'Gravity' on a reissue of the Wicked album but with Miley Cyrus singing it.  The song within the framework of the album is simply gorgeous and such a standout - the end credit's version doesn't hold a candle to it.  The other songs and the music score are great too.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|WOW - great movie and enjoyed this very much - love Nicholas Cage. Thanks for making it easy to find here.
B00EP7A446|4.0|Cliff's voice sounds old in places here, but others don't hear it.  I also think the accompaniment is overdone--too busy. I enjoyed listening to the album, though, but I don't think I'll be playing it much.  I hope Cliff records an album of original material before he hangs up his pink jacket.  Incidentally, if ordered through amazon.co.uk, this album costs half the price.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|She's great. High expectations met. Truly one of the best songwriters of the last 20 years. A credit to Yeovil.
B008ROH07W|5.0|Awesome recording.  The two pieces with Alison Balsom's horn and Iestyn Davies's voice is worth the purchase price of the entire album; a rare and splendid musical experience.  Recommend watching the [...] \\"Sound the Trumpet\\" video to gain the entire sound and visual experience.  No words can describe the resulting interaction created by two performers working together to produce a wonderful sound.  I'd call it musical perfection.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Not her worst or her best. Was not a complete waste of time like some of her other later books.
B000002G89|3.0|OK, but not my favorite Clapton CD.  Somewhat disappointed.  Probably need to listen to it more and maybe it will grow on me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is just a great book.  It is , of course, a story but is also a realistic telling of how people had to live during that time.  The German people were as much to be pitied as to be blamed.  There were thugs and bullies but there were also people  who were just trying to stay safe and survive.  War is not nice for anyone.  In spite of enormous danger, this family risked all to save one fellow human who just happened to be a Jew.  And Death was everywhere.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This was a action packed movie with a lot of twist and turns.  This movie will leave you guessing at the end.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I felt the story was very captivating. I wish the author would expand her vocabulary a bit. I really enjoyed it though.
0316322407|5.0|I watched this lovely girl on CBS with Diane Sawyer interviewing her.  It was an hour long special.  I thought this would be a good Christmas gift for my young grand daughter for her to admire this girl's courage and also to see how women and girls are treated in Middle Eastern countries and how we here in the USA cannot take our freedoms for granted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is finally avaliable for kindle! its a little slow when first starting up but other than that its perfect!
B008JFUR10|4.0|MINI-REVIEW: this monster-robot movie is going to be most enjoyable for people who enjoy watching lizard monsters from the sea go at it against giant robots at the expense of humanity's existence. It's more style than substance but then most people are going for the fight and eye candy special effects, I suspect. According to Wiki the budget was $190M and so far it has made $407M at the Box Office. Expect a sequel.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just cant stop playing!!!!!! and I don't play video games...don't know how they did it...and I have to finish all the levels cant stop now
B000UZNSWM|5.0|Well written, especially with enough distance in time to do proper research and let the history settle.  MacArthur and staff are exposed as to what happens when a general officer is too long in grade; ( over 30 years for MacArthur) reaping the adulation of the public.  Generals are servants of the administration; that is as it should be.  They can become myopic.  Power corrupts and MacArthur, Willoughby and Nuland are prime examples.  It is a great read and although you may not always agree with the author, you will be much better informed as to the history of that period.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'm a home studio musician/recording engineer, and this movie thoroughly inspired me to get and spend some more time playing music, but more intentionally, and with other people to inspire those spontaneous, inspirational moments that don't happen when sitting behind a computer monitor trying to lay down a song by yourself! Thanks Dave!!
B00GIXY4M8|2.0|I found this movie to be long and boring.  I am glad I did not spend money to view this disappointment in the movie theater.

B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Great! And amzingly upbeat and hopeful for Atwood sci fi. I couldnt put them down. I read Oryx and Crake when it came out, and then the Year of the Flood and Maddadam in a few days right after Maddadam came out. I wish there were more books in the series.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|later rounds very difficult to complete for me. Nice Graphics and concept. In quick shot mode that is score dependent to advance to the next course. In Tournament mode, best score out of 9 shots to advance.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Quite a few fun puzzles. Keeps you busy for a while if you need to be entertained. The dialog<br />gets kind of wordy, but it is a good story. Totally recommend this app.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I loved this app until dec 5, 2013. It automatically updated on my kindle fire. When i open my mail, it flashes 2-3 times before completely liading. I also now have a permanent 'sponsored ad' email at the top of my inbox. It is always there, however it changes the product that it is advertising everytime i open my inbox. It is also impossible to delete or to unsuscribe to.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 5 year grand-daughter, Emmy.  She was very excited to receive this present to her.
B0073COMUW|3.0|Good solid light.  Comes on quickly, generates very low heat. However, its a very white light, which tends to make things look harsh.  The color of the light was very problematic.  I ended up replacing with a Cree light bulb with equivalent stats.  It just made the bedroom feel warmer and was easier to read by.
B00F031WB8|4.0|This dvd (or blu ray) has two main sections: Section one offers a documentary of Jimi's life while the focus of section two („Extras“) is on three concert performances.<br /><br />The documentary part (almost 2 hours) about Jimi's (too short) life is quite similar to the previously released &#34;West Coast Seattle Boy&#34; documentary. Added are excerpts of concert footage published on previous Hendrix dvds. However, the entire part one is presented in widescreen format, which means that all the original concert clips have also been cut (reduced in height) compared to the originals which were filmed in 4:3 format. In my opinion that‘s clearly a wrong and disappointing decision! These concert clips could have been presented in their original format with added black areas left and right to fill the widescreen format, thereby avoiding the mutilation of the original material!<br /><br />There are also some new interviews, among them some with former girlfriends of Jimi‘s (Fayne Pridgeon, Linda Keith and Colette Mimram (now with a new last name). Other important girlfriends of Jimi‘s, like Kathy Etchingham, Jeanette Jacobs and Carmen Borrero are not interviewed (Kathy probably might have declined to work with Janie Hendrix‘s company), but (blonde) Carmen is at least briefly seen with Jimi, in a clip on the road from Noel Redding‘s home videos. There are also new comments by Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, engineer and sound master Eddie Kramer and several other contemporaries who are still alive, Billy Cox being the last surviving band member. All the best to you, Billy!<br /><br />Many documentary comments are illustrated with (mostly silent) short clips of Jimi performing (for example Stockholm 1967, bits of the psychedelic color film shot at Falcon Lair (formerly Rudolph Valentino‘s house, in L.A.) on August 17, 1967, some very short film cuts of Jimi‘s performance at Madison Square Garden, NYC, on May 18, 1969, a very intersting film piece of Jimi recording „Voodoo Child&#34; (with Mitch on drums and Jack Casady on bass) at TTG Studios in Hollywood in 1968. This I would have enjoyed more had it been presented without interruptions, but here it is chopped into pieces.<br /><br />The extras have 3 sections:<br /><br />1. First, there is the documentary about the concert at the Miami Pop Festival on May 18, 1968. The former organizer Michael Lang (also organizer of Woodstock 1969) gives us some background information and then we see four filmed clips of Jimi's performance: &#34;Foxy Lady&#34; and &#34;Tax Free&#34; are about complete and there are also fragments of &#34;Fire&#34; and &#34;Purple Haze&#34;. These clips are really exciting, in good (color) picture quality and 5:1 sound! Jimi and also Mitch are in good form. But, as with the documentary the Miami Pop film has been cropped to 16:9 from the original full 4:3 format, which leads to the stupid effect of cutting off the upper parts of Jimi‘s and Noel‘s heads (forehead and above) in some shots (not that many, thank God!) If video engineers are given the task to cut a 4:3 film down to 16:9, it would be nice to at least make sure they don‘t chop off parts of heads!<br /><br />2. The second concert film is from the New York Pop Festival, on 17 July 1970, Downing Stadium, Randall's Iceland, NY. Running time is approx. 20 minutes.<br />Parts of this concert I've seen on youtube, but here the quality is obviously much better. Jimi plays &#34;Message To Love,&#34; &#34;Lover Man&#34;, &#34;All Along The Watchtower&#34;, &#34;Purple Haze&#34; and &#34;Voodoo Child, SR&#34;. The sound is mixed to 5:1. This film has not been trimmed down. So there‘s no frustration to fear. Funny: The producers actually apologize and warn us that this film is shown in it‘s original form. They do the same for the Fehmarn film:<br /><br />3. Recently discovered footage of Jimi on the Isle of Fehmarn, September 6. 1970, his last concert performance. He died only 12 days later, on September 18.<br /><br />Attention! Your tv must be switched to 4:3 format for this film! The access to the Fehmarn film is somewhat awkwardly hidden in the dvd menu: Below the song list for the New York Pop movie you have to click on the &#34;more&#34; button.<br /><br />This Fehmarn concert film is a real pleasant surprise, especially for someone like me who experienced Jimi Hendrix performances live (all three performances in Berlin: May 15. 1967, January 23. 1969, and September 4. 1970).<br /><br />Running time of this part is about 16 Minuten. The footage shows Jimi from the perspective of the audience. Most of the time the camera catches him up close, quite clearly and always in color, doing  &#34;Killing Floor&#34;, &#34;Spanish Castle Magic&#34;, &#34;All Along The Watchtower&#34; und &#34;Foxy Lady&#34;. Finally, the last seconds of „Hey Joe&#34;. In between the camera cuts to the audience, trying to protect themselves from the bad weather, but most of the time it‘s Jimi. The stereo sound was caught by two overhead microphones that had been installed on the stage without Jimi knowing about it. The sound is quite good, realistc and enjoyable, pretty much the way the audience must have heard it, but not remastered or according to the standards of a professional recording, of course.<br /><br />4. As an added extra, there's the complete clip of Jimi's appearance on &#34;Top Of The Pops&#34; with &#34;Purple Haze&#34; (in black and white) of 30 March, 1967.<br /><br />Okay, I guess fans of Jimi Hendrix, especially those who experienced him performing live, like myself, have different preferences as to how his legacy should be presented to the public than the owners with their (mainly?) commercial considerations. Also, I‘m  not an &#34;objective&#34; reviewer, for whom Jimi Hendrix is just one among many other musicians. He was and still is very special to me. (My other favorite musicians are John McLaughlin, Miles Davis and Jeff Beck, who I also experienced live many times over the decades.)<br /><br />So this dvd (or blu ray) is mainly worth having or at least watching for longtime Jimi Hendrix fans, the main reason being the concert films. The publication policy of the company &#34;Experience Hendrix&#34; has it's advantages and it‘s disadvantages. Well, I wasn‘t too happy about what Alan Douglas did before, either.<br /><br />There is still a lot of very intersting Jimi Hendrix concerts material in the vaults. We fans have been waiting for the restored film of the Royal Albert Hall concert (24 February 1969) - where Jimi gave a great performance, absolutely worth seeing and hearing - for nearly half a century now! So far only a bootleg DVD of it has been released,about ten years ago, with low quality video material, assembled from the collections of various fans. According to what I read „Experience Hendrix&#34; has up to now been unable or unwillig to come to terms with the producers and owners of this film, Steve Gold and Jerry Goldstein. An insider book on Jimi Hendrix tells us he himself had agreed to the filming of the Albert Hall show, but not without strong misgivings, allegedly considering Gold and Goldstein to have „adding machines for minds&#34;. Well, if that should be true and „Experience Hendrix&#34; is unwilling to pay enough to finally get the publishing rights, the film is probably kept in the vaults until it rots and nobody will have any advantage of it, which would be a real shame, especially for those who really love Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Anyway, it‘s astonishing how much unpublished video and sound material of Jimi still exists and then suddenly surfaces after all those decades. But will there stll be a public big and interested enough and willing to spend money on it when most of those who actually saw and heard Jimi during his lifetime have also passed away? He was a great and exceptionally creative musician with undeniable personal charm and magnetism, that‘s for sure. Forever in our hearts!re. Forever in our hearts!

B007C94QRK|2.0|Growing up with The Muppet Show, I really wanted to like this movie.  Unfortunately, it lost the kids' interest and honestly I found myself finding other things to do while it was on.  The premise is really odd and the movie seemed to creep along way too slowly.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Too many extra cost and charges to continue playing game.  This game is not worth the extra expense required to play.  I will probably remove it from my Kindle Fire.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This is Fire Maple's best so far.<br />Pros: Great graphics, puzzles ranging from easy to head-scratches, a progressive hint system to help with the latter, and a good soundtrack.<br />Cons: Not as long as I'd have liked.<br />Overall the best 99&Acirc;&cent; I've spent in quite a while.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Great music to relax to anytime. The music is timeless. The  guest singers were a pleasant surprise. Look forward to more.
B00G922EA2|3.0|just ok. could use a sequel. wasnt long enouh for my taste.it seemed like the ending kind of sucked.<br />it could be quite a bit better.

B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Ivan Vorpatril gets involved in a giant complicated mess... and this time he can't blame it on his cousin.<br /><br />If you've liked Ivan when he's showed up in the other books, then you should read this one.  It's essentially more of the same, but for an entire story.  There's some more digging into relationships and history from his point of view as well.<br /><br />Miles only shows up for about ten pages in total.<br /><br />The usual humor, excitement, and intrigue that characterize the series are all there, and in my opinion Bujold has returned to her former level of story quality after the somewhat disappointing Cryoburn.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was very well written, the narrative style (Narrated by Death) was a great twist. The story kept me rapt until the end and I loved the historical references. I am anxious to go see the movie but afraid it won't compare to the feeling I had while reading this. One of the best books I have read in quite a while!
0060245867|5.0|My 18 yr old was with me in the library, we were looking for books to read to my granddaughter( her niece) when she reminded me about her favorite book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. My daughter reminded me how much she loved Numeroff' s books so we rented it to read to my granddaughter.<br />SHE LOVES IT!!! Over and over she wanted this book read to her.<br />So I bought the box set for Christmas.<br />I love adding to my granddaughters book collection
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Very simple...fun....it can be very addictive.  The pop up request to review it can be annoying, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  It's a strong 4.5 star app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you've read the first book, The Hunger Games, you'll want to read this one. It is a fitting continuation of the trilogy which makes you want to read the third book.
0785168109|5.0|Excellent quality and so full of pictures, which is what we were after for a gift for our 6 yr old son. This books is not for young children though- not specifically, but he loves it, and so do his three older brothers. The story-boards were a great bonus, because my older sons are practicing panel-art for comics and story-boarding, which is not usually a thing included in books not about story-boarding. The concept art was also a nice addition. Overall, the book is somewhat dark (as in visually), but the images are still very clear and the angles of shots are also very clear. Individual parts of the suits are shown in illustration as well. Also, it was shipped very quickly, the price, I think is amazing given what it is, and we were all definitely happy with the book.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie if you love action and sci- fi adventures. I do and this is one of the best ever.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I really want the Spider game that is more of a challenge and don't know how to change it up.  For beginners, this game would be perfect giving them confidence of winning but for me I want more challenge.

B000005JAK|5.0|It is interesting to go back and time and listen to albums like this one.  While music in general seems to have polarized since 1990, making the musical intensity of this album seem almost middle of the road, there is no denying the emotional and cathartic impact of such songs as &#34;All This I've Done for You&#34;,  &#34;No Promise Have I Made&#34; and &#34;I Don't Want to Know if You are Lonely&#34;...and if you just want to thrash, try &#34;Dead Set on Destruction&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it! Can't put it down!!breathtakingly! Can't wait for the movie! Don't ever want this to end. Brilliantly written! Love!

B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This movie had technical difficulties and no audio. Stopped at the beginning and refused to play. I need a refund for this movie at your earliest convenience
B0089LOG02|5.0|My nephew had a story about the orphan train in his 4th grade reading book. I was fascinated and found this book! I loved the way it jumped between past and present and showed not only the parallels between the 2 characters lives but the uncertainty, fear and lack of security and love that many foster children feel. How sad that any child should feel so isolated and how wonderful a blessing when a loving family accepts the child and the child can develop a sense of belonging!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Being able to clip and set up different notebooks...great tool for keeping track of random things found online. Great for tracking crossfit WOD's
B000002L9J|5.0|Basically a singles band, this is clearly their best album effort, both for the strength of the singles and the knitting together of the concept.  My favorites include the title track, &#34;Frankly Mr. Shankly&#34;, Cemetry Gates&#34;, and &#34;There is a Light That Never Goes Out&#34;, but there is hardly a weak track here.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I really liked this movie, but was disappointed with the cheesy ending.  It kept my attention, and was fun to watch- felt like it was building to a great finish, then fizzled out a bit.

WALL-E is a trash compactor, the last of his kind from an age in which cleaning up garbage was mankind's highest priority and before people threw in the towel and the broom, and apparently rocketed away. Now, this robot with his pivoting goggle eyes resides in a metropolis surrounded by skyscrapers that turn out, on closer inspection, to be compressed trash bricks piled high into the soot-grey sky. This animation film, directed by Andrew Stanton and his PIXAR collaborators have taken all cultural detritus, especially bits and pieces from cherished film genres, pop icons, visionary sci-fi tropes, half-remembered bric-a-brac from childhood and compacted it all into a sublime work of art. This PIXAR animated film is widely recognized as a critique on society. It brings up real issues that the world, and especially densely populated areas, are dealing with today and even more so in the future. Katherine Ellison asserts that “Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.” Landfills are filling up so quickly that the UK may run out of landfill space by the year 2017.<br /><br />There were advance rumbles that WALL-E would be tough going for children and go over their heads, that its story would not be understood, with its grim outlook in its storytelling experimental. Although the images are frequently flabbergasting, the narrative is as simple as Chaplin, Keaton, Jacques Tati, even the Teletubbies! Maybe the animation film only seems experimental because it's evenly paced, linear and doesn't call for viewers to do the perceptual equivalent of multitasking (which viewers these days seem to like!).<br /><br />Although there's plenty of silent film slapstick, the apocalyptic context adds a hefty dose of melancholy. We laugh when WALL-E finds a little box with a diamond ring and then tosses the ring and keeps the box, but the thought of the couple that left it behind is rather poignant. Dust storms drive WALL-E into his lair, where he endlessly re-watches clips from the film Hello, Dolly! and particularly the opening number with Michael Crawford warbling about going to the city and kissing a girl. It's WALL-E's only link to the 1890s senses and world of limitless horizons and conspicuous consumption and crowds of people. For companionship, WALL-E is limited to a sort of cockroach (evolved) that's virtually indestructible and also indestructible are cream pastries he consumes that are clearly modelled on Twinkies [American confectionary] and a great punch line to all the jokes about the perishability of that synthesised cake like product.<br /><br />From the beginning, PIXAR, a beacon for the future of animation film technology, explored themes of loss, decay, and the dark side of materialism. The old-fashioned toys of `Toy Story' were soulful repositories of childhood love rendered obsolete by newer and fancier models. Even PIXAR's most routinely plotted film, `Cars' was steeped in the romance of old machines. It's as if those machines hold memories that humans forget and beauties that have been overlooked with growing up in a fast-paced cyber-world.<br /><br />Here, director Andrew Stanton (`Finding Nemo') extends that theme to the ruination of the entire planet, which he explicitly ties to an unchecked free-market embodied by a giant corporation that took over with the &#34;Buy `n' Large&#34; and I feel they are aiming their target at Wal-Mart. And its message is aimed at too much consumption, that helps to soften and fatten the human race (which you can see the results with the humans on the AXIOM spaceship) and separate them from the natural world. The storms, meanwhile, conjure up the planet's most catastrophic man-made environmental disaster and especially the Dust Bowl, born of greed for corn profits, that left topsoil suddenly vulnerable to winds.<br /><br />The first part of `WALL-E' has no verbal talk, apart from the ‘Hello, Dolly! VHS Tape Video and Fred Willard on an old video as Buy `n' Large's &#34;global CEO.&#34; Then a rocket descends, accompanied by Thomas Newman's score, which, like the animation film, is a gloriously inspired m&eacute;lange, like Warner Bros. cartoons. What emerges from that ship is Eve, a smooth white egg like robot with a head that floats above her unattached, but vaguely Japanese look, with violet cat eyes, like a sprite out of Miyazaki. WALL-E is instantly smitten, even though Eve blasts anything she deems a threat and  culminating in an edgy courtship at the start of their contact.<br /><br />Eve's mission and where it leads eventually to Eve and WALL-E discovering each other. But humans are sort of involved, and there are rollicking chases and eventually a tender love story. When a little-girl giggle comes out of Eve, WALL-E suddenly seems like one of those animation films where two lonely robots discover each other and share wordless adventures. There's a rocketing space pas de deux between WALL-E and Eve in which the lyricism is positively transcendental. Somehow these two robot machines have to rein fuse what's left of mankind with the joy of play. Their electronic coos and twitters recall `Star Wars' and `E.T.;' especially with their only visual aid is a tiny pot.<br /><br />Like all previous PIXAR films, the meaning of `WALL-E' is deeper and more profound than the merchandising opportunities found therein. It's a love story, yes, but it's also a story about staying true to your own heart in the blandly evil face of authority. It's a tale about saving the small things and cherishing the world you live in, no matter how imperfect its surface might seem. Andrew Stanton, who won an Oscar in 2004 for `Finding Nemo,' has certainly earned his place in the pantheon of animation pioneers, but with `WALL-E,' he has taken not only the art of animation, but the art of storytelling to new, unimaginable heights. This animation film of `WALL-E' as a character is a very poetic figure of the robot drawn to human splendour, remains powerful throughout and PIXAR's loveliest creation.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – 'WALL-E' gets a direct-to-digital transfer presented in a stunning 1080p encoded image video and with a brilliant 2.40:1 aspect ratio. PIXAR has crowed that there is not a pixel out of place, and the hyperbole is justified. 'WALL-E' is a visual masterpiece, and the sparkling surfaces are as sharp and clean as any high-definition image you are going to see. Much of the animation is photo-realistic, and the level of detail to the picture is five-star. A good portion of 'WALL-E' takes place on dusty planet surfaces, so there is some intentional diffusing of the picture, but it's absolutely appropriate to the intended look of the film. Shadow delineation is also superb, with even the darkest areas of the picture revealing the finest of textures still visible. The colour palette is expansive, and one of the best examples I've seen yet of the improvements high-definition offers over standard-def. Comparing the Blu-ray and standard DVD editions of 'WALL-E,' it's clear how much smoother fine gradients of colour are in high-def. Hues are also richer, especially primary colours. Flesh tones, as they are, are also accurate. But most impressive about 'WALL-E' is the sense of depth to the picture. This is as close to 3-D as you are going to get without wearing glasses and on a large screen the effect is magnificent. Predictably, the encode image is rock solid, with no artefacts, edginess or moir&eacute; patterns, and an absence of noise. For my money, 'WALL-E' is the new reference standard for an animatedpresentation on Blu-ray. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is offered for 'WALL-E.' There are no other mixes offered (not even standard Dolby Digital or any other foreign language dubs or subtitles. The audio is superb, delivering a fully immersive experience that is sure to dazzle. Animated films are always a treat to enjoy on high-definition because their soundtracks are constructed wholly in the studio, from the ground up. Every element sounds in the right place, with an expert balance of effects, music and dialogue. The added surround channel helps open up the rear soundstage wonderfully, with excellent seamless pans between all channels. Discrete effects are numerous, and subtle ambiance is almost always sustained. The score is also perfectly integrated and bled throughout. Dynamic range is rich and robust, with excellent clarity and attenuation across the entire frequency spectrum. Low bass is as tight as a drum and never overpowering to the rest of the mix. Though 'WALL-E' is surprisingly light on dialogue (particularly the first half of the film), the spoken word isn't given short thrift and the mix is always perfectly balanced. Finally, it's no surprise, given that this is a PIXAR film, how well-recorded 'WALL-E' is. The mix never sounds artificial or processed, and the source is as clean and slick as a newly-waxed floor. 'WALL-E' sounds as good as it looks.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: PRESTO [2008] [1080p] [5:00] ‘PRESTO’ is a 2008 PIXAR amazing imaginative and visually-gorgeous Computer Animated Theatrical Short Film, was released with the theatrical release of ‘WALL-E.’ ‘PRESTO was directed by veteran PIXAR animator Doug Sweetland who made his directorial debut with this animated film, and also voices the two main characters Presto and Alec Azam. This short is about a magician named Presto DiGiotagione and his cute hungry rabbit, Alec Azam. At the beginning of the short, Alec is seen locked in his cage in Presto's dressing room, trying to reach a carrot inches out of his reach. Presto comes in, having finished a meal, to test his magic trick of pulling Alec out of a hat. After he sees that the trick works, Presto is about to feed Alec the carrot, just as he hears a knock on his door, letting him know that it's time for him to go on stage and do his act. Now extremely angry, Presto chases Alec behind the stage and gets pulled by a rope into the air, but soon slips and falls with many heavy objects falling above him. Alec then saves Presto from being crushed by making him fall into the hat. After a short pause, the crowd begins to cheer for Alec and Presto. Alec, in a bad mood, begins to walk away when Presto beckons him to come over. To cheer Alec up, Presto makes the carrot appear again, which Alec immediately eats when he comes out of the hat. They end the show as friends and Alec becomes an even bigger part of Presto's act. I liked it even better than ‘Burn-E.'<br /><br />Special Feature: BURN-E [2008] [1080p] [7:00] A beautifully-animated and whimsical PIXAR short film. ‘BURN-E' is a repairbot (a welding robot) who is determined to do his job, but is foiled at every turn by WALL-E's adventure aboard the AXIOM. The BURN-E (stands for &#34;Basic Utility Repair Nano Engineer&#34;) and the character is first seen briefly as a welder robot in ‘WALL-E’ when WALL-E and EVE fly around the AXIOM Starliner, and enter through a door, locking him outside of the ship. BURN-E is seen banging his fists against the door, and ultimately realizing that he has been locked out. After the credits, an arm comes out from SUPPLY-R's body and pats BURN-E's head and he says, in a dull, motionless voice, &#34;There, there.&#34;<br /><br />Special Feature: BURN-E with Boards [2008] [1080p] [7:00] This the short film ‘BURN-E’ [2008] that is also viewable in a PIP mode that includes a running storyboards for the entire short.<br /><br />Special Feature: WALL-E's Treasures & Trinkets [1080p] [5:00] A vaudeville of WALL-E's favourite misadventures.<br /><br />Special Feature: Lots' of Bots Storybook: Play Games, solve puzzles, and have fun with WALL-E in his storybook adventure.

The scenes are a mix of wholly completed and rendered scenes, and some in more raw states of completion.

It's a rare treat of a film that inspires and takes one's breath away with its almost effortlessly astounding storytelling. `WALL-E' is a film for all ages that has the potential to entertain every member of the family and isn't limited as entertainment for children. PIXAR has done a remarkable job with this stunning Blu-ray package. The animation film's video presentation is truly reference grade and will remain a standard as demonstration material for years to come. The audio presentation is equally exceptional and creates a palpable sense of atmosphere and immersion. Supplements are also robust and the set's many in-depth and entertaining documentaries will provide hours of entertainment beyond the film itself. Wall-E is a must-own title on Blu-ray and deserves a place in every Blu-ray collection and it especially goes pride of place in my ever increasing PIXAR Blu-ray Collection.

B003BW0CB6|5.0|The story line for Connelly's novels is always compelling and this one holds its own among the best. While not entirely a true Lincoln Lawyer story, it melds Maggie McFierce and Harry Bosch into its own tapestry of intrigue including villainy and victimization. I felt like there should be two more books from this story line. I didn't want it to end.

Other great gets include: Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen evil Chancellor of the UFB , another Underworld Veteran Bill Nighy is Matthias. Kate Beckinsale is amazing as kick-a$$ 'Lori Quaid UFB agent ( I expect Sharron Stone is writing her hate-mail as I write this), this time the lovely Jessica Biel as Melina, a member of the Resistance. Overall its a good film but I thought Biel and Beckonsale's look and body types were so similar (confusingly so at times in action edits) that i'd hoped some more deliberate twist end would come up to make this decision make sense. The Look of 21st cen United Federation of Britain and Australia is more Blade Runner-ish than the original RECALL, I like the verticalness of it, and speaking of Vertical this remake contains possibly the best elevator shaft sequence since DIE HARD! (It definitely puts SW: Episode III shaft scenes to shame).
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is so funny! It is unlike dumb ways to live which I think is very inappropriate. I don't know how they made this better because it's almost the same.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Meh. I had the impression by the end of the film that all of its actors got lost in the magnitude of the genre rather than the content of the film itself. I'd recommend it as a quality form of entertainment, but wouldn't expect it to win any awards.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Talk about a realistic character - Katniss doesn't ask to be the center of attention, nor does she want to be.  She's not the most beautiful, charming, talented person in the world.  She's just a girl who needs to protect her family and will do anything to do so. Every character has his or her own personality, and his/her own development.<br /><br />The plot moves quite quickly, which is nice for action-packed books like these.  I hardly ever read young adult or teen books anymore, but this trilogy got so much hype I had to pick it up.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this is the first in the series of books and introduces you to ana and christen. christen is slowly being changed by ana, especially with the &#34;vanilla&#34; sex. fifty shades come into the book because christen considers himself fifty shades of f***ed up. christen is used to getting his way when he is interested in a &#34;relationship&#34; he is very clinical in all his &#34;relationships&#34; and makes all his subs sign a contract. he tells them what to eat to stay healthy, they must work out with a trainer, and must stay in top shape to be able to keep up with his sexual preverences. ana changes all. that she doesnt want to sign anything but christen still wants her and agrees to a &#34;vanilla&#34; relationship. this is just the begining of a great series of books. if you look past the graphic sex and see the heart of the story which of how a damaged man can be transformed by love and who learns to love in return.
B00640UICA|5.0|I loved this game! It was so cute! It was a challenge without being too irritating. I wish it was a longer game. Definitely a great game!
B0026977EK|1.0|Awful, self conscious acting, arch dialog and unrealistic premise. Except for the physical.beauty.of the actors and the locations, just an eye rollingly bad, smug movie. Penelope Cruz was the only one at ease as an actor in the whole thing.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is so awesome. I could not stop playing it .it's better than real steel the other not free one.it has so much more selections of robots and ,since its free, you can delete it whenever you want without wasting money . But I suggest that you don't because you will never stop playing it
B00CCXL9OE|3.0|I didn't know it was UK version until It arrived.  It does say in the info on the page but it should be more visible in the title.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's a good game and all it takes a long time to download it is a fun game to play and so.
B00FKQ38OE|4.0|McCartney is back to making good music. This is a totally solid album. It's no RAM, but it has some very touching moments and is good to listen to start to finish. No duds on the album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is a 4 real time killer. Sometimes it is a time devourer!! Ration your time wisely! And remember...go to bed!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really do not know how bad a game it is yet but they are making me rate it. How lame is that.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Read the trilogy in 3 days. So upset with final book. So sorry to have read all 3 without looking at any reviews. Waste of time. It has a lazy, poor ending. Roth builds up a powerful and inspiring heroine over 2 books and then totally lost this reader by changing the chapter format to 2 alternating narrators and a fast, wimpy ending. If she was trying to use overshadowing for us to have any idea this was coming, she totally missed it with me and lost a fan. Where were her legions of advisors on this last book? Did success go to her head? Very disappointing end to what is a provocative premise.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Perfect replacement for my original ear tip that served me well for a long time but finally succumbed to the rigors of everyday use.  These are exactly like the original and I am glad they came with the foam covers.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter was given this book as a gift and I decided to read it.  Wonderful read!  Another wonderful read is Whisper by Dana Faletti.  It's a trilogy and the second book is being released in January.  Can't wait.  Pick both of these books up together!
B0014U4X3U|5.0|Who doesn't love Jane Austen! Love her stories, love her characters, love her writing. Highly recommend this book to have all the stories at your fingertips.
B0002XH9Z4|1.0|like used，made roughly，dirty in front of it,i really hate hate hate hate hate hate hate it as a MJ fan.
0762451319|4.0|i love this set and everything in it. i got mine at barnes and noble for 11.99 so this is a great price but when i got the magnets they were a little bent now they are fine but definetly a let down
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Sure, there is that terribly, awfully racist song and dance routine which keeps it off TV. But the rest of the movie is pure gold (If you're offended, skip Lincoln's birthday, seriously, fast forward) and you'll enjoy the very first time White Christmas was performed in a movie, and you'll see amazing dancing by Fred Astaire. The thing about classics, and this is a great one, is that we have to understand what time it was created. This came out during World War II, and so White Christmas becomes especially poignant. But it's also a movie with fast-paced slapstick that, after all these decades, works.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|One the most unusual movies one could see, interesting.<br />Good movie, good acting, a different kind of movie for sure.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I didn't really like reading but this book introduced me to the joy of reading. After reading this I raced through the rest of the series and starting reading much more than ever in my life.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Love Jane Austen. I purchased this before buying the whole Jane Austen collection. I enjoy her writing, the characters, and the whole genre of the time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle was slow and kept messing up but thanks to clean master it now runs smoth i will recommend this app to others
0440237688|5.0|great book cant wait to read the other ones. the book was very good quality as well and for such a great price
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A story of love, blind need, desire, commitment, and focus on each other. Because of their deep love, you find yourself hoping they reach peace with each other in spite of the world trying to keep/tear them apart. You want this to happen; as much for them as for yourself.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great movie.<br />Everyone should see this movie and get educated about the harm and sickness our food supply can bring.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun way to exercise your brain! Only problem was I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to try all the levels!
B000068CNX|4.0|Purchased for my sister - per her request. She loves the series and has thoroughly enjoyed watching. The ease of purchasing the DVD and sending to her is very nice.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|i used this to replace the failed fan in a dual hard drive enclosure sold by OWC; as the old fan failed after 3-4 years of constant use, it became louder, which made me seek a quiet replacement; it is not silent, but it is probably quieter than the two idling 3.5&#34; hard drives in the enclosure; part of the attraction of this model was to hedge against the uncertainty of having the right nuts to attach to the posts in my enclosure; indeed this came with so many nuts, posts, rubber stanchions etc. that i feel bad not finding a use for the leftovers
B005HE5J7I|3.0|Ponderous and slow-moving. Read this while in London so it was interesting and insightful. If you plan to travel to London, it's definitely worth reading. If not-be prepared for a long slog through characters and plot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read every book that Mr. Grisham has written.  It's a combo of &#34;I can't wait to see what happens&#34; to &#34;I don't want this book to end&#34; in Sycamore Row.  I love his style of unexpected and  clincher endings.
0060922583|5.0|Great book to understand some of the forces that hold it all together.<br />Takes awhile to read since it is a complicated subject.<br />The 3 dimensional DNA we all have as our individual body blue print.<br />Our aging is programed into the DNA.<br />With the right equipment (read Transylvania Sunrise for details) your old age appearance is already determined at birth.
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|If you like Bryson...<br />Seems to be able to write a lot about a little.<br />Mostly entertaining.<br />Educational book about an era?
B002JWD6AS|4.0|For myself, I read these books to escape from reality for awhile. I have no great expectations of brilliant writing.The storyline is fun and has no basis in reality.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Absolutely spot on with up to date background on relevant research.  it amazes me that with all the valuable information from a wide variety of credible sources like Dr. Perlmutter that some seem to think that their local GP, who only gets his information from the drug companies with their vested interests is the best and ONLY source of health advice. Perlmutter's work is substantial evidence that the US food chain with its emphasis on monocropped products (wheat, corn, sugar) and hysteria about fat free is driving health advice instead of evidence based research.  Don't wait until some government agency makes some proclamation - inform yourself and make your own decisions. I have purchased  a couple ebooks and several hard copies for gifts!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Typical Buble style. Easy on the ears, but annoying at times. Really tries too hard on a few tracks. &#34;You've Got a Friend&#34; is a nice adaptation. If you need some &#34;ear candy,&#34; this is the c/d for you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A simple concept but still challenging. I love puzzle games and this one certainly live up to the challenge. A definite yes and we'll forth the price.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|A must see movie, before making any judgments about the &#34;Affordable Health Care Act&#34;.<br />When you see that American are getting less health care for more money than every other country you must take another look.<br />The dogma of the medical for profit medicine costs American to die in pain and broke.<br />Once the money is got, so are you from the doctors mind.<br />Watch this movie and learn some truth's.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Husband LOVES it! He plays Guild Wars 2, and this makes playing that much more enjoyable. Logitech is the best!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|For myself, I read these books to escape from reality for awhile. I have no great expectations of brilliant writing.The storyline is fun and has no basis in reality. But, I don't know many women that didn't really enjoy -like me - reading these books
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I just started watching The Good Wife and I'm speeding through the seasons to catch up with this year's shows. I started it because I loved Chris Noth in Sex and the City and wanted to see more of him. He's a terrific actor but I must admit, I'm just as impressed with all the other actors on this show. Storylines are top notch and I like how the characters have developed over the years. I hope this shows goes on for a lot more years!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cool game but it could use more cheaper costumes other wise u have to pay for almost all of them which makes the game a wee bit worse but otherwise it rocks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 6 year old says she loves this game.  She likes all the clues and hidden objects.  She sqeals as shegets to the next level.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|its great if you only want netflix ,as there is nothing else there.If there is a way to add more sites and someone knows how please let me know
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I no longer have to steal my husband's itouch!!! Thank you for bringing candy crush to kindle!!! Now I can be addicted with out all the are you done yet!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Really fun game to help pass the time. It's like bejeweled blitz but even more fun! I really like the ease of play.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|It seems to me that alcohol and drugs DID NOT play a role in this crash. The pilot performs admirably. His being under the influence does not cause him to crash the plane. It appears people want to blame the alcohol or coke when there is no evidence that it was a factor. The NTSB makes an issue of something inspite of the evidence.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I had 80 saved lives and extra lives. I updated and lost all of them. Now I might have five, and the next time I open it, I'm back to one. It was my favorite game. Not anymore.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|absolutely amazing. love watching youtube and Netflix. It is the perfect size and I can carry it around with me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for this ... actually gave up looking for a while ... but really enjoy this!  There goes &quot;spare&quot; time!  ; D
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|I loved this movie and am satisfied that the movie tied up loose ends.  Lots of great action sequences and sideways humor.  It shows  a possible future that is blended with different cultures.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addictive! even when the level is difficult, all you want is to go through and play more. And you can play it without paying any money!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Never have I read a more interesting and touching account of kindness and brutality during this most sad space of time in human history.  The author paints a portrait of our failures and yet unfailing heart of GOD seeded love as seen in Papa,Rudy and the Book Thief.  The images painted in my mind will live with me until the Narrator pays a visit at my door.  Thank you Markus for sharing The Book Thief with the world.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|All the information about Doctor Who I already knew, but I am glad that the future generations will know it as well. The set up for the 13th Doctor was outstanding. Christmas here we come! You have to love the uniqueness of Doctor Who. There is no other show like it and there never will be. I anticipate a long continuing story. I hope that the new older Doctor will be just as intriguing as the others. Love it!
B001AGXEAG|4.0|A lighthearted but rather zany movie about a couple that dies but remains with the house, and their attempts to frighten away the new occupants. A bit scary for the younger kids (under age 9), but engaging nonetheless!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love Angry Birds and I love Star Wars.  This is just like PB and Jams, you can't go wrong.  I can't wait until Rovio add more levels.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show from the get go, too bad the network didn't air all the episodes and in the correct order.  Don't expect any strange colored alien lifeforms.  This show focuses more on living in the depths of space with day to day struggles and accomplishments.
B00ECW9UJY|5.0|Loved this movie. Follows along with the book until the alien encounter....you know Hollywood has to change things, but the rest was as close to the true story as Hollywood will let it be.  Arrived on time and intact, new in package. Thanks for the excellent service.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It is impossible to win at level 13 without buying help.  I'd rather purchase the game at first and not have to pay to be able to clear a level.  Also it seems to be more of a game of chance than having much ability to develop strategies to win. I found I would be payinga lot of money just to keep playing.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Inventive, clever and never a dull moment.  The season ending was amazing and the perfect way to change the Doctor.  I really enjoy these and I watch them over and over. Starting from the beginning to the last available. I can't wait for more in season 7.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|A beautifully written novel  with a wonderfully crafted character at the centre of the story. A book that can be re-read and enjoyed over again
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|My daughter and I love this game, we can't get enough of this game.  It's a great game to play with another person to see who has better timing and reflex.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I loved this show when it was on SyFy.  Great imaging and storyline too.  Sharp picture.  I could go on and on on how the humans are struggling for survival and how the cylons want to hunt them down.  It makes one reflect what is humanity, being humane while still being a human, what drives a person to commit whatever actions she/he needs/wants in her/his day to day life.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Alarm clock extreme is the only alarm I use,  I have a different schedule every day and all I have to do is check off the time I want. I never miss an appointment,  outstanding app.
B00BEIYLAW|5.0|This is a brilliant movie. As far as I can tell, after reading his biography, they portrayed him fairly accurately. Ashton did a great job at being Steve Jobs, you forget that you aren't watching the real Steve Jobs on screen. This is a must have for any Apple fan.
1451666179|4.0|It's a hilarious book and I read it all in one sitting because it's so funny. The only thing I wish is that it was all new stuff instead of a couple repeats from the blog.
B002TKFEZK|4.0|Controversial view of finance that may be completely wrong as reality unfolds but a very good reminder of the financial mess of the recent crisis whose legacy endures
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is fun and it makes you think.  I can't stop playing this game, did I mention it has good music too?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Tis this game so fun i will die playing it lol<br />Its great and has years of fun into it ill at least play this for another year
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app for the Kindle Fire.  I use it every day!  It provides great up to date info.  Its been quite useful with the icy weather.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I think either you are a fan or are not.  I am a fan and loved the ending to the 1/2 season cliffhanger.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I love this show! Just wish they would bring it back for a season two. Time to watch serenity now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|more floors please!! and maybe a sound when you're wrong would be helpful. themes floors or updates would be great. something that shows readers humorous with Easter eggs
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|There are not too many Kakuro apps out there to begin with and you could always go for the free ones if you wanted, but spend the couple of bucks or Amazon Coin for this if you play a lot, want something that is visually pleasing, want a good interface and something that has a huge variety of puzzles. Developer did a good job putting in the time for it. This app blows the other Kakuro options away!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Love this series! So addicting! I started with the first books and then the shows on TV. I hope there is a final conclusion soon though, revealing all the secrets!
B009CVRQLY|4.0|Different sound for her, surprised me.  Not the huge grandiose productions, but it  is growing on me. Need more time to listen and form opinions really.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was as also  a hit with my three old grandson.  This kept his attention while waiting in doctors offices etc...He is a pro at it as well.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|excellent movie, had a very good ending, sent a good message.  Any move with Denzel is a good movie in my book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Spectacular set, hard to follow stories, but unlike TV can replay and or rewind, LOL<br /><br />What is HORRIBLE is the packaging!  Who the heck thought this was a good idea?!<br /><br /> Why can't it come in a plastic container or at least boxed where there are NOT SO MANY PIECES!  AND why in world does the back credits, with story of contents, are not even attached, but a lose piece of paper!!  ??<br /><br />How does one keep this all these pieces in set, to make it complete and collectable!<br /><br />For the price needs better storage!  Can retro fit a plastic container or tin?
0545626382|3.0|Not quite sure what has happened with the publishing of this particular set however, the first book was missing pages 154 through 187 and there were duplicate pages in the same book.  I bought this Trilogy as a gift for my son.  He says he will write to the publisher to have &#34;catching fire&#34; replaced.  (that was the one with the messed up/missing/and duplicate pages.
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|AMD's premier flag ship (and last) fm2 processor. Fast, sharp. Plays most games in 1080p on medium and high settings.  Pair it with fast ram for best results. Easily overclocked, though it does get VERY HOT (I overlocked mine only to 4.3GHZ and it runs around 115'F). Definitely CANNOT use the stock fan that comes in the box. I have it paired with a sapphire radeon HD 7750 gpu. Notice a little<br />'hanging' when there's a lot going on on the screen. Not sure if its due to bottleneck. But its neglible. Can play SC2 on ultra. Warcraft on High all while on 1080p resolution. Have not tested the integrated graphics, but I hear it's 'okay'.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Jar of hearts. . . That song!  Who has listened to this and not been stopped in your tacks?!?  We've all been on both sides of the &#34;jar&#34;. . . My hat goes off to the talented writers, who so beautifully state the issues, thereby touching us all!
0345529057|5.0|My Dad loved this series, and wanted to read them before seeing the series on television. A must for any fan of the series.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|good action, acting, and plot. This is an amazing look at an experienced pilot that has his integrity questioned after a crash.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never quite understood till grandkids taught me. Now I play fuss and Try to win. Warning once you start it will trap you!! Nice break but again annoying when I can't win.
B0061QD82E|1.0|Notting Hill hijacked by a ridiculous bastard . The Haughty pug will abandon belle to an unbearable street dog.<br />From the beginning of the cartoon however , suspicion is brought to this dog without manner who comes from nobody knows where. Little by little, he managed to get into the daily life of the decent neighborhood of Belle. By his wiles , he will win her heart. To do this, he will have no qualms about putting her in danger. After all what does it cost? and then with all the loot it could bring in!<br /><br />A film not recommended to children in part because of the music scene at the midst where a prostitute sings the merit of our tramp in bed. She's accompanied by a chorus of dogs without pedigree and sentenced to death on top of that!<br /><br />The motive? reproduction, assimilation of wealth, control of territory. The bastard will accommodate very easily to its role of impostor.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the shining when it first came out and the movie did  not do justice to the book.  As I read this book my mind drifted back to Dans childhood experience..adding a full circle experience.  Great read,I am never disappointed inStephenKing.
0393316041|4.0|Funny.  Who knew Physists could be so funny and lead a productive life changing the world one atom at a time.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Absolutely LOVE the music and the arrangements!  The Piano Guys deserve more stars than the 5 allowed!!! I would recommend any of their CD's.
B00EJX2YGM|1.0|The DVD's are for region 1 and from my delivery address it is obvious that I live in Europe - Region 2. This meant messing about changing the settings on my DVD player so my partner could watch them. So I am sure when she opened the birthday present the joy very quickly turned to disappointment when she could not get them to play.
B008M4OYYY|5.0|Really like these Nanoblocks.  This is a gift so I have not opened it yet, but it looks good.  I have several sets and enjoy them.  However, they are not for clumsy hands or impatient fingers.  Some of these sets only take a gentle bump for pieces to fall off.  Nonetheless, a great knock-off from Lego (another favorite of mine).
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|I LOVE this game it is great you need to get this game I Like it and I am  a girl.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I enjoy the game, but not liking the idea that in order go farther I have to pay, and that's not really fair.
B0082XJGRK|1.0|Sucks big time.  He shou8ld have gone to school to learn how to write prose.  BOOOOOOOOOOORing.  Boooooring and more booooooooooring
B00BBI9WD6|2.0|This review is for the Kindle version only.  The formatting was atrocious and left a great deal to be desired.  The original book had double spacing between paragraphs when th one conversation ended and the point of view changed.  3/4 of the time this spacing was omitted in the kindle version making it very difficult to follow the story at times.  I had already read the book in paper-back format so I was able to muddle through.  I WOULD NOT recommend a first-time reader to get this in the kindle format!<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book itself.  It got me hooked on the rest of the Honor Harrington books and the books set in this universe.  If I were to rate the book itself I would give it 5 stars.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Very provocative story line, full of twists and turns. I never saw ending coming and I write science fiction stories myself.
B00ANY94A0|5.0|Friends Legos are so much fun and my daughters really enjoy them.  Legos are one of the best quality toys made (As a mother of 6, I've bought my share of junk) and will last.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|I'll be honest. I enjoyed the first movie of Hunger Games, but not quite as much as everyone else did with how they raved about it and such. I just thought it was a good movie that was overhyped. As a result of this feeling, I was not in a hurry to watch Catching Fire. I just happened to be bored after work one day and decided I needed a movie to watch. I chose Catching Fire since it was the only movie on the list worth watching (for me at least).<br /><br />I have to say I was blown away by the movie. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, is filled with surprises and unexpected occurrences, and has downright amazing acting! I swear, the acting was so good that at times you forget your watching a movie with actors/actresses.<br /><br />Overall, the first film was good as I've already stated, but THIS film (Catching Fire) is the one that got me to finally start raving about the Hunger Games. Awesome movie and highly recommended if you enjoyed the first.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Wish had more games like this load of fun I have a great time playing it.<br />Have some fun win you play it to.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Excellent documentary showing clearly the problems with the American healthcare system.  Other advanced countries have better care for free, covered by the country's tax system.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I was initially opposed to reading this book, however everyone else in my book club was encouraged. So my journey into Tan's fabulous story began. What a wonderful story of three generations of strong women whose stories are all very parallel. The story pulls you into empathizing with all of the characters - and truly feel the pains of the heroines. Thanks for a fabulous story and great historical references of China.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|A pleasant reminder of the film which I continue to revisit on special mornings. The sound track has a good balance of mood most tracks stand on their own versus mere background fluff.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The game is fun and additive. It's easy and hard to put down. I like the kindle file edition better, less lag and it loads faster.
B00FHATBGW|2.0|Sorry,  but I didn't enjoy this one.  All of the clues were in crazy order--either I was supposed to pick something up without knowing why or I was supposed to examine something which didn't stick out at all.  I had no idea what I was doing, so I git sick of waiting for the hint to keep recharging and just quit.  Big Fish, I love your games, but this one seemed a bit half-baked.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Such a cute movie!  And my 5 and 7 yr old loved it as well :)  Such a great lesson as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book. It's been a long time since I've been so touched by a book. Well worth reading. Hard to put down.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Horrible horrible horrible! Every song is bland. What happened to straight forward rock & roll?<br />Tom Scholz admitted that he hasn't listened to ANY new music since 1976. WTF?? I had high hopes<br />for this new record. Very very disappointing.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Good acting, writing and cinematography...a movie treat. The multiple stories within the story give the film<br />dimension that keeps you involved.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Pink Floyd &#34;the wall is a great purchase... Brings you back to the good times ....<br />The anniversary deluxe edition
B00E9A656K|4.0|It's a good app but it can get really boring if you like drag racing get it but if you don't do not get this app
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Cool Game it's realistic and if they make more of this game or more of its type I'll get it
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Was fun....but has changed. I have the feeling that I'll never accomlish anything. Spend alot of my own money...  It needs to return to the way it was a year ago. I would gladly go back full force!
B000IKQMFO|1.0|Great cast, great writer, wonderful setting, lousy story -- turned it off after suffering for 20 minutes.  We didn't care what happened to any of the characters.  Don't waste your money.
B001GCUNYO|3.0|First off, the mediocre rating I'm giving the movie is not because of the film's cinematic quality, it's because of the video problems I'm experiencing.  I'm not going to review the movie; it's old enough that it really doesn't need one more person's assessment (I really did like it though).  Although I am not having an issue playing the disc at all, as many 1-star reviewers have noted, I experienced horrible macro-blocking and strange light/dark bands flashing on the screen for about 2/3 of the movie.  I had rented the DVD years ago, and I actually like the movie (shameless action movie entertainment) but I wanted the Blu Ray version.  I don't know if anybody else has had the same issue as me, but you can clearly see very distracting pixelated areas in dark scenes, and huge bands about 1/3 of the height of my 1080p tv where the colors alternate between darker and lighter shades of the rest of the screen, and it kept alternating, so I would see a light picture across the top and bottom, dark across the center, and it would flip around and alternate, just to make sure I didn't forget about it and actually enjoy the movie. I played it on my PC's blu-ray player with PowerDVD 13.  I will try it in my Panasonic player, and maybe the PS3 to be sure, but I haven't had issues with any other discs.  I watched Pacific Rim, Oblivion, Man of Steel, and I Am Legend, all new (to me) Blu-Rays this week without a hitch.  Also, the back of my movie's case had a 2&#34; cut down the center, as if a carpet knife or box-cutter had gotten to it.  The discs reveal no physical damage damage at all.
1932100660|3.0|Spoiler alert.  Want to get the cliffnote version of this 400 plus page book?  Meat/Dairy=BAD, Vegan Diet=GOOD.  This was a very comprehensive book with some very useful information in it but pages can be skipped without missing any pertinent information.  My Doctor recommended this book so I read it.  The book drones on and on and on about the concept that animal based foods are bad and plant based foods are good.<br /><br />I did give it three stars because it did have some useful nuggets in it.  If you already have nutritional understanding you can skip this book and if you do get this book you can skip many pages and still find useful information.  I have to admit it has reinforced my personal desire to eat less meat and more plant based foods.  It did compel me to look at the other items in my grocery store that I used to overlook due to the higher prices.  I think this book did influence me to at least try soy milk and to my surprise I like it so I have made a jump from cows milk to soy milk which I can contribute to this book.  Overall I think you can find more useful information reading articles on the internet than having to read this book.
B00631HASU|4.0|I bought this game when I was an iPhone user, so the game is beautiful, but it has an issue, the image is anamorphic, even with the game have as a part of it name HD. This isn't HD, is anamorphic screen.<br /><br />Please fix it and will win 5 stars.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Love this game, especially the graphics, but it gets stuck easily and crashed after level 23.  But I like it enough that I have started over for the 3rd time.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It never shows MY weather.it has high definition radar, and does not work.if you get this app I hope you have a good review.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Obviously this book picks up the story of little Danny from The Shining, but there were glimpses in it from many familiar King novels.  Very much enjoyed the story line and depth of characters!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!! Hell yeah! This is some mind crushing work and in my opinion it stands with all of the earlier Metallica work and exceeds And Justice For All! Simply amazing stuff here. long songs but so many tempo changes they stay fresh as hell. The band is completely ON FIRE here. Yes it is recorded loud but do not let that scare you away. I gave up on Metallica after Load came out and never bought another album. They have won me back in a big way....this hits like a Mike Tyson right hook!!! Smoking, killer, 5 star album!!! Can not wait to hear the next one! Come on boys, make it happen!<br /><br />Edit: I thought I would mention for anyone thinking about purchasing the vinyl that it is a lot better than the CD. Still sounds loud but not as much clipping and the instruments are more clear. This album rocks, the negative critics on the sound quality are overblown.<br /><br />Edit 10/2015: After repeated listens to the vinyl there is still an alarming amount of clipping which is unfortunate. I have never seen the DR ratings for this vinyl but would imagine it comes in at 5 or 6 which is piss poor for vinyl. I finally broke down and downloaded a remastered version which blows the original CD and vinyl away. It is sad that some guy in his moms basement can master an album better than a &#34;professional&#34; getting paid tons of money. Lars, if you are reading this get up off your ass and remaster this album properly!!!<br />My full Metallica power rating rundown:<br />1. Kill Em All 10.0 - a perfect metal album for me. The first and still the best. Brutal energy unleashed, raw but extremely powerful. Masterpiece number one and my first Metallica album.<br />2. Ride The Lightning 9.9 - easily could be considered a 10. This one adds some polish to the production and shows some growth in song writing and James vocals show improvement. The title cut is a brutal assault and Fade To Black remains one of the greatest metal songs ever written. The Call of Ktulu is an incredible instrumental as a closer.<br />3. Master of Puppets 9.8 - many fans would put this at number one. Stellar production and incredibly strong from start to finish. Battery, Master of Puppets, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium) all stunning and epic masterworks. Orion may be there best instrumental ever and Damage Inc. is about as strong as closer as you can get.<br />4. Death Magnetic 9.6 - production problems aside this album is so strong and so consistent it has moved into my top four. The first four songs are as strong as you will ever find. Incredible stuff here, wildly shattering all expectations. Absolute masterpiece and very easily the album of the year. Truly one of the great metal albums of all time. This deserves a proper remastering. Search out a download remaster version without the compression.<br />5. St. Anger 9.5 - that's right!!! A rock solid offering and highly addictive from start to finish. No weak tracks here! This challenges Kill Em All for most angry and agressive Metallica album. This one is criminally underrated! Wow, love the drum sound and everything about this. A few more guitar solos would have pushed this closer to a 10.<br />6. And Justice For All 9.4 - obviously an all time classic and the last of the first four brutal and classic era. Long intricate songs with expert playing. This one pushed Metallica into a new level on popularity with MTV.<br />7. Black Album/ Load/ Reload 9.0 - all incredible in their own right and all rock solid. This is polished Metallica, fully produced with more of an AC/CD hard rock sound than their speed metal roots. These albums outraged some fans who wanted the old Metallica to continue forever. I disagree. Still full of great songs and blistering solo's if you can get over your preconceived notions of what Metallica should sound like and simply enjoy it on it's own merits.<br /><br />This band has never released a poor album in thier existence.oser. 3.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Great album.  Great price through Amazon.  I liked that they host the album for you in the cloud so you get a digital version as well as the CD.  I loaded the player and can listen on my PC, my laptop and my iPhone.  As a bonus, if you like pictures of rusted out minivans, this CD is for you!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Not bad, not bad. What I'm trying to say is this application is not that bad. It does what it says.
0316017930|5.0|If you like to better your self this is a great interesting book. Makes a lot of sense a great start to a big future
B005LAII12|3.0|I am sorry, but it was ok, I am not much for foul language and that seems to be what is in this movie alot.  But, it was entertaining, but had to keep it from the grandkids.
B000W796OM|5.0|I wanted to won the entire collection and now once again I have it. I am totally satisfied to have it
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game was fun, some what challenging and only ten levels.  Can you escape was great until the tenth level were no logic was envolved and you had to rate the app to keep the game.  I know for a fact that on the iPod you can get this game for free and all the levels (100 levels).  So why not on the kindle?  Don't get this app if you origanlly had an iPod and are addicted to this game or if you want long term entertainment.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is really cool I have the console version and like how you can unlock things for it. To bad it wasn't on Amazon sooner!
B004M3GDI4|5.0|This is a great light. I use this light for search and rescue. I wanted a light that was easy to use with your gloves on and the selector knob on the headlamp serves that purpose just right. This headlamp has a on off lockout so that you can't accidentally turn the light on. I like this feature as well for when I have my helmet with my headlamp stored on my backpack during a search or when I load my pack in the back of our transport vehicles. The only thing I wish it had that would make this headlamp perfect is a red light mode for when im doing a night search.
