B00846REIS|4.0|This was a easy read.. very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />I enjoyed reading this book  :)I only wish the next book had already been out! to long to wait for next read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been a while since I have read a book that I think about from the moment I wake up in the morning until the minute I go to bed at night but Gillian Flynn's new novel, 'Gone Girl', left my mind swirling every second I was reading it. It is the most thrilling novel I have read in a long time and I highly recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|First, let me say \\"No Easy Day\\" should be taken for exactly what it is: a first-hand account of one SEAL's recollection of what happened. Like any recollection, there may be inaccuracies, but that's to be expected of ANY recollection. I've always been curious about what happened during the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, and I have to say, this account confirms what I expected. Yeah, the SEALs may have been told this was \\"capture or kill,\\" but I think it's pretty clear they wanted to kill him. Yes, they did seem to have probable cause to fire by the time they came upon Osama given the resistance they had faced, but to first shoot him in the head (that seemed justifiable) then to shoot him AGAIN as he lay on the ground with a head wound? Seemed like overkill to me, whether they could see his hands or not. It's not shocking the White House would've wanted to amend the account slightly. It seems like that was done as much to protect the SEALs' reputation as the President's (who had the guts to approve the op in the first place).<br /><br />I would have given this account five stars except then Owen had to start taking digs at President Obama, which made me wonder about his true motives for writing this book. First he doesn't even want to sign the plaque given to the President because he doesn't want his name associated with it yet now he's writing a book? (Anyone should've known Owen's real name would get out.) It's no surprise the President didn't invite Owen and his colleagues up to the White House for a drink: something tells me they weren't all that friendly when they met him. W's \\"Mission Accomplished\\" debacle was far more showy and exploitative, yet Owen doesn't mention a word about that. Ultimately, I got the impression Owen had a bit of an ax to grind. It cheapened his book overall and made me wonder if he had motives to perhaps amend a few details, just to make the White House look bad and justify his (and supposedly another SEAL's) shots to the chest? Unfortunate tipping of his hand at the end there.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|As I'm not a fan of the horror genre, (which this book is not)I took a chance on Stephen, believing early reviews, and am glad I did.<br />I enjoy the aspect of time travel, how writers deal with the anomalies and paradoxes, and was pleased at the treatment Stephen gave it.  Admittedly the seeming primary focus of the book, the assassination of JFK, takes a backseat (had to say it) to the personal journey of the main character, the relationships he develops, and his evolving outlook on life and time and choices--along with a healthy helping of historical fiction.<br />This book reminded me of a book I enjoyed in my youth, \\"Replay\\" by Ken Grimwood, so much that I ordered the Kindle version of \\"Replay\\" and reread post \\"11/22/63\\".<br />Certainly recommend this book, not that Mr. King needs any help from me, but for those who, like me, are first time readers of the author, I believe your journey will be most enjoyable.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I like paying due to the physic involved. Has a lot of levels, great fun and addictive. Like the different types of balls that you can use.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun. My boyfriend cant beat my high score and I love that!!! This game is a fun way to waste some time and it is addictive.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|As a Pet Head, I wholeheartedly agree with Krysztoph Tennant's review.  PSB tends to release albums in stark contrast to their latest albums...  that's how they consistently reinvent themselves.  Slower albums like these tend to be appreciated more after several listens, and mostly embraced after several years.  For those expecting a dance/disco romp?  I get it, I'm in the same camp and I really enjoy the faster dance tracks myself.<br /><br />For that, I highly recommend their new song \\"A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi\\" on the B-side of the Winner single.  It's a wonder why that song was left off of the album.  But give the album a chance.  The warmth, depth, and lyrical content has got me hooked and I gladly purchased the album.  I'd say \\"Leaving\\" and \\"Face like that\\" and \\"Winner\\" are my personal favorites and rank up with their best tracks.  PSB unites Pet Heads around the world.  :)  Cheers!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Game is great but for every deal you have to either endure a commercial or x out of the commercial.....it gets a little old.
034580404X|5.0|A bit much. Should have an NC 17 rating. Not for everyone.It was a quick read.Story moves fast,just like Mr.Grey
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie was so bad I walked out of it and I haven't done that since Vanilla Sky.<br /><br />There was a scene in the first half of the movie that went on for probably 20 minutes - where all that stuff is crashing into the ocean, into the ships, etc.  It just went on forever and ever, just for the sake of what was supposed to be terrifying. It wasn't - I just wished it to be over so we could get on with the movie.<br /><br />The acting was amateurish and unbelievable.  Everyone on the ship looked like an idiot who didn't pass the 4th grade.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that would appeal to junior high to high school and those with minds like it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|My wife and I were concerned after 5 seasons as to wether or not Dexter would still have his Mojo working. Let me say emphatically yes, twists, turns, surprises that lovely dark humor. A delight from start to finish we had to ration our viewing or we might have watched the whole season in one sitting. Fans this is a big season in the adventures of Dexter and the ending...lets just say Holy S..t!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book to see if it would be good for my daughters to read. At 8, they're a little young for some of the darker and more gruesome parts of this book, but it will be a great book for them in a few years (though it's well within their technical reading level now).<br /><br />As an adult reading this, it's an incredibly fast and easy read, but very engaging. You have to take the premise on face value. The cameras seem to see anywhere and parachute-gifts fall in impractical places, but it all works well in the story, so it's not too jarring. The biggest thing to remember is that this is a YA book. It seems like many reviewers have criticised it like an adult book and if the author had taken those extra steps to make it deeper and more believable to an adult, it would go right over kids' heads.<br /><br />In short, it's well worth it for an exciting weekend read.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Rango has a unique, quirky always enjoyable feel. Its the first full length CGI cartoon from ILM and they've created a gem. I feel this movie is almost more geared for adults than kids. Its ragged, dusty, slightly dark style is wonderful but many of the sly, clever verbal references may be over the heads of your average kid. Wonderfully creative with some captivating twists and turns we really enjoyed it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I'll admit I had to think a bit before I bought this book. There was a little voice inside me saying \\"should this guy really have written this? And out of respect, should I be buying it?\\". I had heard that Owen went to great lengths to ensure there was no classified or valuable operational intel being given away in the book. After thinking about it and remembering that Obama was giving an interview with details just a few days after the raid, I decided to read it and give it a try.<br /><br />For those who may be where I was, this paragraph is for you. Owen states in the beginning of the book that he changed names, left out or changed operational details, and omitted classified and sensitive information. He states that he hired a lawyer familiar with special operations and employed a team to comb the book for classified information and remove it. Can you trust him? Well, we all remember the famous tail assembly of the helicopter that went down in the compound. It didn't look like anything anyone had ever seen. It was widely reported that this was a new \\"stealth\\" Black Hawk that no one knew existed. In the book, Owen doesn't even mention this \\"stealth\\" helicopter. He talks about the Black Hawks as though they were the normal special operations Black Hawks. Even when he gets to the point of seeing the tail assembly on TV, he doesn't make any mention of anything special about it. That fact should lend credibility to his effort of leaving out sensitive and classified information.<br /><br />I am a military history buff. I also love guns and other weapons. I consider myself to be more knowledgeable than most I know, on both subjects. That said, I am a civilian. I am not in the military, nor have I ever been. The closest I've been was ROTC in college. So, with that understanding, I didn't learn anything new about the SEALs or Special Operations that I didn't already know. All the tactics discussed, and all the weapons discussed, can be attributed to the SEALs and spec opsthrough various field manuals and other publicly available information. In fact, there is a list of sources at the end of the book where you can find references to likely everything discussed in the book. I haven't vetted that list, but as I said, I didn't learn anything new and I don't have access to classified information.<br /><br />The story itself focuses on Owen's time in the SEALs in a post 9/11 world. The story isn't meant to be a biography of his life, rather it's meant to articulate the training and sacrifice these men go through everyday. It's meant to show the family-style bond they have. They train to make their operations routine. They train so the operations that killed bin Laden are as routine and straight-forward as any other operation, including ones he discusses in the book. After hearing many stories of grand gun battles and Osama bin Laden going out in a blaze of glory, the final part of the book discussing the actual raid was *extremely* interesting. Owen offers some insight into his perception of OBL's psyche, based on his behavior in the final moments, that I agree with.<br /><br />There is some political commentary, mostly Owen's opinions. Per his account, the teams stayed out of the politics except for the higher-ups. There is some political motivation behind Owen publishing the book. It is obvious that he is not a fan of Obama, and he states most of the teams feel the same way. He makes some digs at the President, but also gives him credit for making the decision to send them in, after being given several different options. He states that when he decided to write this book, he remembered that Obama and other officials had already given their interviews and shared details about the operation. He felt that if they could do it, then he should be able to give perspective of someone who was actually on the assault team. He knew going into it that he was going to lose the respect of some of his fellow teammates, but felt the story needed to betold.<br /><br />I am only giving this book four stars because it seems like there was a lot of build up to the actual assault, and then the assault itself went by very quick. Perhaps this is intentional, as it articulates Owen's point that this was 'just another operation' (emphasis mine). Much of the build up was to articulate the points mentioned above. I know about the SEALs and how they train, and have read about the bond they develop. Undoubtedly, this made the information less important to me and more tedious for me to read through. Someone else without that knowledge probably wouldn't deduct a star for it. For someone who is just looking for the straight scoop on the assault and is familiar with the supporting material, you'll have to do some reading to get to it. Overall, it's very much worth it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome book. Well written and while sad, very inspirational for what the human spirit can accomplish. Have your children read this book!
B008C40218|5.0|Truly beautiful album -<br /><br />Perhaps one of their most accessible albums to date in terms of album/song structure, but that in no way means it's easy or light. Algiers is full of shadowy, mysterious, exquisite songs, woven into one beautiful complex and cool album.

0525953728|5.0|Loved this book! I think it takes a lot of guts to be a seal, more to be an elite seal, further to tell the tale. The writer has lived an amazing life of a true war time unsung hero.  He does an excellent job of describing the life of a Seal without compromising the security of the Seals still active.  He in fact honors the men he served with, shedding light into the most highly trained Special Forces team in the world.

B008EL4YX6|3.0|too much depends on timing for this game; for a phone game, I would expect something a bit more challenging with the puzzle aspect and less with the timing.  I see many positive reviews, so some people enjoy the game.  The finish of the game is a bit unpolished and needs something to be what I would expect with a paid/not-free app.

0425263908|5.0|I was never a reader until fifty shades. I read it and loved it but was very disappointed when I was done with the series. I eventually googled what books were similar and this one came up. Sure enough amazon had it and had many reviews! But all of them were true to their word, the book is amazing and can't wait until I can buy reflected in you.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|I love \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" and let my son start watching it when he was 2 years old. I also let my son watch \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" despite a few parts that bother me (Kiki runs into the road almost getting hit by a car, the cat makes a weird joke about someone drawing Kiki naked, it's very subtle and pretty harmless although it is a bit odd).<br /><br />In \\"Ponyo\\" the boy is unsupervised playing by the water, people are underwater in various circumstances and through magic able to survive, the mother drives the car extremely fast and the boy is not always buckled up, and Ponyo licks the boy's blood. All of these things seem like they could give my son the wrong impression regarding water safety, car safety, and avoiding blood born diseases.<br /><br />The graphics are wonderful though.<br />Although Miyazaki's graphics are genius I just wonder if some of that stuff could have been left out.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I, like many others, bought this because I so much enjoyed Major Pettigrew's Last Stand.  Besides the setting being in England and an older gentleman protagonist, the similarities end right there.  Rather a depressing, plodding story.  There are hints at a backstory but instead of making me more curious, I kept feeling like I had lost my way, again sort of like poor Mr. Fry.  I'm not sure how I ever got through it.  I think I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because at the end there are a few redeeming features.  Not a bad first effort by this author.  Cannot believe it was a finalist for the Booker!
B005NFJAZS|3.0|Quality of video is good audio is also good . However playback halts then go's forward off and on near middle in library scene
0670813028|5.0|My grandson loves Stephen King and mentioned that he'd never read the book nor seen the movie version. We both agree that books are almost always far better than the movies based on books, so I ordered this as a surprise for him. The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition, and my grandson LOVED the book!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I have not been impressed with Angry Birds Space. I don't find it as much fun to play as the other Angry Birds games. I would not recommend it to my friends.
0307960471|5.0|I've read all of the Jo Nesbo books and have never been disappointed and Phantom is no exception.  Harry has come back from the Far East in an attempt to find out why Oleg, the young man who is the son of Rakel, his one true love and whom Harry loves as his own, is in prison for murder.<br /><br />In typical Jo Nesbo fashion, Harry embarks on a journey with so many twists and turns that to tell more would give away a plot that even I could not predict.  Be prepared to spend some wonderful hours with this adventure by a truly gifted novelist.
B000000QFY|5.0|This is a hidden gem among prog-rock albums of the 70s.  It features some of the BEST musicianship ever heard.  This is why such great bands of the 70s STILL resonate today.  Bands like Yes, ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Deep Purple AND Focus are still being explored and played today.  These guys knew how to play their instruments and relied on their skills instead of programming a computer.  Course, they didn't have those toys back then.  But, even the analog synths sounded more organic than the digital ones of today.<br /><br />But, I digress.  This album sounds GREAT on headphones or played at low volume at work.  The arrangements are incredible and the talent doesn't lack.  Sure, we've heard Gary Hoey play \\"Hocus Pocus\\".  But, there is something about the original that makes the hair on your neck stand up.  This album contains rock, classical, jazz, canterbury, folk.  It's all there!!  It's an HONOR to finally add this to my music collection.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Disturbingly predictable even down to the dialog!  We were quoting the movie lines before they were spoken!  Terrible CGI, acting and script.  Truly a movie marketed for 11 year old and younger boys. Pete Berg is better than this!  C'mon!

0525953728|5.0|I am only 65% through with the book, but am already able to give it a 5 Star.  It is well written, and flows nicely.  Moreover, it's a quick read because it's so good, I haven't wanted to stop.  For those of you worried that it's an anti-Obama book, it is not.  The author mentions briefly that the Special Ops folks complained that President Obama would probably try to take credit for getting UBL, and he mentioned the delay in making a decision to GO, but that was about it.  I love the book and will finish it tonight or tomorrow.  5 Stars!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am new to pintrest in general. The app is super new to me.  I do love that I can put the app on the favorites bar of my fire so it is easily accessible from the main screen. The pintrest app itself is quite useful and easy navigate and repin. So far so good :)
B00338QENI|5.0|Henrietta Lacks' story still haunts me. A fascinating book of history, science, and tragedy.  This compelling non-fiction work is heartbreaking and impossible to put down. It blends a singular family's history with the ground-breaking scientific discovery of Hela cells and reveals the incredible impact of one woman's life on the practice of medical research throughout the world.  A powerful, elucidating book that makes science accessible to the layman while shedding light on the complex issues faced by one African-American family whose heritage is inextricably linked to the Hela legacy.  This thought-provoking book depicts one woman's struggle with cancer while raising questions about the future of scientific research, commercial medicine, and patient confidentiality. On my 100 best list.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app let me know what a HUGE drain on the battery the GPS will require. Information like that is great.
1451627297|4.0|Basically, Mr. King had me from page one. This author has such a gift for engaging the reader and drawing the reader into his story, that no matter how tense it gets or how tedious, once you start, there is just no stopping. Even though it took me 7 months to finish the book, and when I turned the last page of the book my feeling was simply, FINALLY, I really enjoyed reading it, immensely!<br />Approximately 850 pages long, it does try one's patience and might better lend itself, for some readers, to being read in segments, as I read it. The book could be described as several books in one, since there are so many different themes and characters developed; these might easily be grouped into sections, severally or singularly. That said, the characters and the different themes surrounding them were developed very well and left little for the imagination. I am certain the research for the book was very intensive, although there are times when the author uses poetic license with the facts.<br />Because it feels like several books under one cover, it is not difficult to put it down and resume at another time, even after reading several other books. Like a soap opera, it will feel like nothing has changed in the intervening space of time. It is the mark of King's skill, that his simplistic but incredibly creative and interesting, informative way of presenting the story, so that the plot just keeps moving along, keeps you bound to it. If you are of a certain generation that lived through the Kennedy assassination, the characters will feel real, feel like people you might even have met in the past, characters with whom you can identify, whether or not you like them or what they represent, and certainly many are characters you will have learned about, either in school or from news reports. In some way, their emotions and behavior will reach out and touch you so that each time you pick up the book, possibly after an extended pause in the reading, you might feel as if you are encountering an old friend, once again.<br />This is the story of Jake Epping, a schoolteacher, separated from his wife. He is befriended by Al Templeton, a janitor and the owner of the local diner which seems to have a door in the pantry that opens onto another time, a place where the time and space continuum is changed.<br />Jake is asked, by Al, to move back and forth in time, in order to try and rewrite history, specifically, the murder of John F. Kennedy. Along the way, he develops other pressing personal issues and problems to solve, and so the story, of necessity, moves back and forth in time with him. Sometimes the length is tedious, but most often, putting down the book for a bit will solve that problem, and the reader will be drawn back to the story to find out its conclusion, of that I am sure.<br />Some of the stories within the book are romantic, some violent, some tragic, and some are mysterious, but all are interesting. George Amberson, alias Jake Epping, moves from Maine to Texas, eventually, via a circuitous route created for him by Templeton,  who has passed the mantle of his failed effort to stop the assassination, onto the shoulders of his created character, George Amberson.  Al has tried to think of everything George will need to enable him to step into his shoes, at the appropriate time. Within the confines of the diner, the doorway to the past leads specifically to 1958. George will have five years, until the assassination takes place, to plan his stragegy and deal with how the past protects itself from interference. His road will be a long and arduous one, but he will navigate it several times, by choice, with different purposes.<br />As the story and its odd coincidences continue, called harmonies in the author's terminology, some events and themes of the past will converge and intertwine with events, as George's new life transpires, day by day, and so it begs you to suspend disbelief so that they will add, rather than detract from the themesthat eventually develop. Cars that caused tragedies in the past will become the tools of tragedies he will experience in the future, albeit the future of George Amberson, not Jake Epping. Knives that caused grievous injuries in the past will reappear and be used to cause other tragedies once again as will hand guns, injuries of the past will be similar for other victims in the future, etc. For every change in the past, there will be some ripple to come, and this effect may or may not be positive.<br />The romance, the supernatural, the science fiction, the coming of age of certain characters, the tragedies, all of these, and more, come together very well. It is not rocket science, but it is a well researched book, albeit with the author taking poetic license with some facts, and it is certainly a good, imaginative read.<br />Is George Amberson successful? Can the future be changed by altering the past? Are there consequences? Are the consequences worth it; in other words, do the ends justify the means? The reader will decide that when the last page is turned and probably not a moment before.

B007N5YIUS|3.0|I like playing the game on my Kindle fire while lounging on the couch, but got tired of the advertisements.  While the game did not change, the lack of ads (and resulting no accidental pass-through if I accidently hit the ad with my fat fingers) makes this worthwhile to me.  While I know that the company needs to make money, the \\"free\\" version with ads is annoying.  I'd rate this higher if there were no \\"free\\" version to compare it to.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I wish it took me back to where I left off. I hate having to go in and remember where I was.
B0086449YA|5.0|Being a long time Mark Knopfler fan going back to 1979 when `Sultans of Swing' first hit the airwaves, I was very happy to receive this double album opus.  In my opinion Knopfler reached a peak with his last album `Get Lucky' and I wasn't sure this album could hold up to that one.  While it may not surpass his last album it certainly reaches the same level of excellence in artistry, creativity and pure musical genius.  It is a joy to listen to his music especially when you compare it to the garbage on the radio these days.  Most of which makes me gag.  It is so sad that many people the world over will never experience music such as this because it just has not been made available to them.<br /><br />Knopfler's music and lyrics are very complex and demands multiple listenings before you can digest it all.  I just love the fusion of celtic, country  & rock.  The lyrics tell you a story or describe an experience and make you think.  Some of his songs are from another time and place.  But not so remote that you can't relate to them on a human level.  His use of the guitar is very original as he allows the instrument to `talk' or evoke emotion - from happiness & joy to sadness & grief.  Some songs actually might motivate you to kick up your feet and dance.  He uses this instrument unlike any other guitarist - past or present. I can't praise this man enough.  He seems to be getting better with age.  Every time a new release comes around I don't hesitate to buy it with no regrets ever.  I feel he has really hit his stride since `Kill to Get Crimson', `Get Lucky' and now `Privateering\\". I also loved the album `All the Road Running' with Emmylou Harris.  It contains some outstanding songs. \\"I Dug Up A Diamond' will bring tears to your eyes. I only hope there will be many more albums from Mark Knopfler in the future!!!  They are all masterpieces.<br /><br />I do have one deep regret & that is that my mother is not here to enjoy his best albums. She discovered Knopfler when she was in her 70's and developed an awe for the man that I had not seen her have for any other musical artist.  And she admired many.  She read whatever books she could find on him or Dire Straits, watched & listened to his concert tapes & albums and even attended his concert in 2005.  If that isn't a testament to the greatness of this artist I don't know what is.  She was from another generation & did not have any musical training or education but she knew what she heard was great music of quality and substance.  That's why listening to his newer albums is bittersweet for me as she passed away in 2008.<br /><br />I will end by saying if you appreciate fine music this album will not disappoint you.  There are some really beautiful songs ( Redbud Tree; Go Love; Kingdom of Gold) with clever lyrics (Corned Beef City) that will enlighten you along with catchy & innovative guitar riffs throughout.  Of all the 20 songs there isn't one you could call weak or filler.  The title song \\"Privateering\\" is just amazing. For me the absolute stand out track on this album is \\"Yon Two Crows\\" which has very celtic overtones.  I listen to this over and over and over and it just blows my mind.  The melody created by the fiddle is simply beautiful and amazing. Great stuff!<br /><br />Keep in mind that this man has been making great music for almost 35 years and is very underrated IMHO.  That's because he doesn't use gimmicks or court the spotlight but is a brilliant musician and gifted songwriter.  Hopefully one day he will gain the recognition he truly deserves.

B005NFW0U0|5.0|Amazing! Both season one and two were incredible also! This show is like one super long movie where each episode builds on all the previous episodes for each season. I promise you if you like vampires, your going to love this! This season also explains how the original vampires came to be. Even though you and I both know its a T.V Show..you'll stop and say \\"Hey that's pretty legit\\" So here's to the best show to come out of the CW.
B006POGWHK|5.0|Amazing documentary. Spoken in German. However it is in English sub-titles. The dancers are the best I've ever seen. Gives a great insight into the high-world of dance!

There is no way this game can be played. You can't even see the tiles. Why would a developer bring up four different games at the same time on a cell phone?

0783225857|5.0|I was born and raised in the state of Alabama so To Kill a Mockingbird was both a great story and provided wonderful historical backgroup for me.  The young actress who played Scout was also from Alabama, Birmingham, in fact, near where I am from.  Mary Badham was fantastic.  She reminded me of my older sister, overalls, short hair cut and all.  I remember going to Birmingham when I was a little girl to see this movie when it first came out.  Going out to a movie was a big deal for a nine-year old and seeing a little girl about my age from my area appear in a Hollywood movie put me over the moon.  As I saw this movie again I relived all of these feelings.  This is a wonderful movie no matter where you are from.  There are no car chases and while guns figure in to the plot there are no shoot-em ups. There is a bit of a mystery and big scare for Scout and her brother.  There is also wonderful acting and great entertainment.
B003E47HL4|4.0|This is an in-box review of Revell's Arado 196. An astonishingly beautiful kit on the sprues, details abound with hardly any flash to be seen. Wing fold option included which looks nicely done. Two sets of markings one for a plane that was based on the Tirpitz and another from the Med. The only drawback to this kit is the flat pack canopy that is included. Not sure why RoG decided to go with this style instead of a more traditional canopy. That being said, if RoG can produce a kit this detailed and good looking, in 1/32nd scale, AND keep it under 30 bucks then there is no reason for some Hasegawa and Tamiya kits being priced as they are. You can't go wrong with this one!!!

B006H5120E|5.0|I must say that I've always liked Titanic, but the 3D version in BluRay is very impressive.  The depth of field added by the 3D treatment adds so much to the film, without throwing things out at you (like in the old days of 3D movies).  Everything about this version is top-notch, including the sound.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|This is Rush's best album since \\"Moving Pictures.\\"  Period.<br /><br />The songs are tightly written, the instrumental prowess is as impressive as ever, and the lyrics explore complex themes in accessible language.  No Rush fan should be without this, and listeners who haven't given Rush much attention before would do well to check this one out- it's one of the best albums I've heard in the last 5 years.

B001O1O71C|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was very sad and interesting. It was a fresh and astounding take by John Boyne. It was well written and fearless. It was very startling and I would not reccomend for children under ten unless you think they can take it.
B002GYI96U|5.0|A little more agressive than the \\"Sophie Kinsella\\" novels, maybe considered more adult that the Kinsella novels.  A delightful read and I will continue to read \\"Madeline Wickham\\".

B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is the best sit com I have ever seen. I think every episode gets funnier the second time I watch it because I pick up on little things that I missed the first time. All the charecters have a great connection to each other and the stories play well with every one.

1401234542|4.0|I am a recent comic book enthusiast, having read many Batman, Superman and Green Lantern graphic novels. Over the last few months, I have read a good portion of Geoff Johns' Green Lantern stories, and he has done a tremendous job making Green Lantern not only relevant, but elevating him as a top tier superhero. I am only recently exposed to The New 52 movement and have some reservations on it as a whole considering the problems that appear to keep coming up. However, I was quite happy to learn that Green Lantern's story would continue where the incredible [[ASIN:1401232345 War of the Green Lanterns]] left off instead of starting over, providing a seamless transition for Green Lantern.<br /><br />Green Lantern Vol. 1: Sinestro has a slower, but great story and beautiful artwork. The only exception to the artwork in issue #6, a style I never have cared for and simply fails in comparison to the first five issues. This volume provides some great insight into both Hal Jordan and Sinestro, and is the start of what will likely become another great story with a very uncertain future. A solid four start graphic novel.<br /><br />One final note. If you have not read War of the Green Lanterns, then I strongly recommend you do so, but before reading that, reading the Brightest Day arc would help too as some of the issues provide the setup to WOTGL. I also recommend reading them in chronological order (search: green lantern brightest day reading order). It is a lot to read and slightly cumbersome, but you will be in for a treat.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Having purchased this book I was unsure of its content, I found the story hard to find during my read as there was so much activity going on in between the story lines. However I got through it and have now read all 3 editions.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Not exactly as the book, but a pretty good adaptation. I was scared that they would really mess up the story witht the movie, but no, it was very respectful to the original material and has some Good acting and action scenes. You wont be dissapointed.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom's books are comfort reading to me.  His style is like an old familiar friend that you look forward to seeing.  I pre-ordered this book as soon as I could and read it in full in one sitting.<br />This story (and the layers within it) was wonderful, creative and heart warming.  I do not know how he does it but each of Mitch's novels get better and better.<br />Such a great and creative explanation of his history of Father Time and how true it is that time rules all of us in every second of everyday.<br />This novel made me truly stop and think about how I spend my time and what I focus on the most - time to appreciate my blessings!!!<br />Thank you for a fabulous read!!

B0094KF4WG|4.0|Firstly, since it's relevant to this book, based on some of the reviews it receives, I am not a SEAL or Special Forces. I can't speak for the tactics or other issues some have complained about. For myself, I just wanted an idea of what went on. To this extent, I agree with the author - it was an important historical event and did need to be recorded accurately. Someone should have done it, but it had become easier for so many others to lie about it. So I applaud the authors decision to record the events that will ultimately influence the way this mission unfolded. Do I think he's absolutely correct in everything he says? No. I think a lot of things were missed out deliberately and further a lot of things were told with a particular spin.<br /><br />But on the whole, I find this account of the events of that mission to be the most believable. By a long shot.<br /><br />As for the writing? It's a little dry. Actually, it's a lot dry. Were it fiction, I'd say the hero was a little too unbelievable, failed to demonstrate any real capacity for learning or growing from the experience and had few flaws. If it was fiction, I'd probably give it a two star rating. It was a bland and boring as adventure stories go. But it wasn't fiction, or at least is not intended to be. To portray this work in any other way, to \\"spice\\" it up or to otherwise portray events differently would be, in my opinion, creating fiction where I wanted to read what was supposed to be historical fact.<br /><br />To that extent, the biggest criticism I can level is that the writing sometimes allowed repetition, or ideas put forward earlier came back in identical format later in the book. These were, fortunately, few and infrequent so I can't be too harsh in my criticism there.<br /><br />Overall, worth reading. To people who want to know what happened, a must-read. Now I still have the SOFREP \\"No Easy Op\\" analysis of this book to read next to round out the experience. I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />For those looking for action and adventure, you may want to try Genre Fiction. For those wanting to understand history, look no further. This is your book.
0802798225|4.0|I think the whole story is very nice. Had a very strong start and it had me laughing. Didn't like the ending, very cheesy... overall however, I would recommend this book and I plan to read it again.

0307946711|1.0|If these characters, all really caricatures, represent the British, no wonder they no longer have an empire!  Unwilling or unable to make personal decisions about their lives, they float along on a morass of the indefinite, until they finally discover near the end of the book, they are truly meant for each other.  I read the entire book, which he must have cast when he was having one of the hangovers he so frequently describes in the book.  I cannot, in conscience, recommend the book.  But maybe it will be better movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ok so I am done with Fifty Shades Freed and I have 1 question... Will we get more? I liked where she was taking it where it started telling the story from Mr.Gray's point of veiw. Also is she working on any other books? I mean Freed was good, real good, and I am not ready to stop. So Mrs.James I hope to get to read more from you soon.<br /><br />  Freed much like the other 2 has everything you could want in a good book romance, drama, action and<br />mystery. It was a thrill to read and I can see myself reading all 3 books many more times again. Please Mrs.James keep up the good work, I look forward to reading more from you.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|I just finished reading Bad Science by Ben Goldacre, and it's the most important book I've read in a long time.  It's not a thriller, it's a nonfiction work of popular science.  But that description doesn't do this book justice.  Bad Science has the power to change the world (for the better), if people would read it carefully and with an open mind.  It rails against the anti-science winds sweeping our culture, and more importantly, empowers ordinary people of reasonable intelligence to think like scientists and protect themselves from so much unscientific claptrap dressed up as science that is for sale, is on the Internet, and even in respectable media such as newspapers.<br /><br />In fact, I believe Bad Science should be a mandatory part of all high school science curricula, or at the very least, required reading for all medical students (who in my experience are as vulnerable to pseudoscience as other people).  Heck, whoever you are, if you haven't read this book, you need to.<br /><br />Ben Goldacre is a brainy muckraker who, with acerbic wit and unassailable accuracy, attacks anti-scientific BS and clearly explains how it cloaks itself in a scientific aura, and how it's wrong.  The beautiful thing is, you don't have to be a scientist or even a particularly scientifically literate person to understand.  Anybody with a brain can detect BS if given the proper tools.<br /><br />Goldacre's targets cover the spectrum from \\"quacks, hacks\\" to \\"big pharma flacks\\".  He lays bare the alternative realities in which live detox treatments, ear candling, anti-aging cosmetics, homeopathy, diet experts, antioxidants, pharmaceutical companies with large advertising budgets, vaccine opponents, and most frightening of all, people who oppose antiretroviral therapy for AIDS and argue that HIV does not cause this disease.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author is utterly fair in his arguments.  But he is not always nice.  (Is there a reason why he should be?)  Ben Goldacre is my new hero, slaying dragons of ignorance and going head-to-head in intellectual combat with some of the most hysterically irrational elements in society today.<br /><br />Along the way as you read this entertaining book, you'll learn what you need to know about clinical trials, about the power and limitations of statistics, and about how to think critically, to become a little Ben Goldacre yourself.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book is one of the best science quotes of all time:<br /><br />The plural of \\"anecdote\\" is not \\"data\\".ro, slaying dragons of ignorance and going head-to-head in intellectual combat with some of the most hysterically irrational elements in society today.<br /><br />Along the way as you read this entertaining book, you'll learn what you need to know about clinical trials, about the power and limitations of statistics, and about how to think critically, to become a little Ben Goldacre yourself.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book is one of the best science quotes of all time:<br /><br />The plural of \\"anecdote\\" is not \\"data\\".

B008B0QH5S|2.0|I'm a big PSB fan. There are albums that are better than others from them, but I'm sorry to say that Elysium certainly isn't a «Winner» and that it will remain «Invisible» in pop music history. Following some of the other opinions here that the album grows on you with multiple hearings, I get to the conclusion that this album is boring even depressing. Never have I said that a PSB song was unbearable but we have an assortment of unbearable titles here like Winner and Ego music. I've seen two PSB concert for the Nightlife and Fundamental tours, but I wonder, if they tour to promote that album, which titles from Elysium they will include. What happened?
B000VDDWE2|4.0|Granted, this is not an earth shaking drama, but it is a fun pop corn movie with a serious message that if mankind doesn't wake up we will pass the point of no return after we continually destroy our eco system.<br /><br />No book report summaries of plots here or opinions on acting.  I own the Standard Def version and bought the Blu Ray so I will only discuss the quality of the transfer.<br /><br />From the very first note of the intro score, I knew I was into something good.  The audio transfer to lossless DTSHD 5.1 was going to be the star and it is.  Hugely deep bass and masterful directionality from your surround system.  Clear and precise leveling of dialogue and foley effects.  The audio for this movie is completely demo worthy in all areas.  Discreet channeling is very frequently made use of though out.  Even if you do not care for this movie, simply as a way to show off or test your audio system, this disc will pay off.  A tip of the hat to the audio editors on this film.<br /><br />The video transfer is good, not great.  In some areas I did notice a small degree of grain but it is not overly present and there are no artifacts that will distract you from enjoying the film.  CGI was a major part of making this film and was done well.  Some of it, the wolves on the ship scene, were obvious to me but easy to overlook.<br /><br />The extras, of which there are many, include deleted scenes, alternate takes on scenes and a few unfinished scenes where the blue screen work had not been completed and they are interesting to watch.  However, none of these scenes really would have made for an extended version in my opinion.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankss.<br />Thanks
B002PHVAQY|3.0|**I'd like to give this product a full review but I don't feel that I can under the circumstances so I will give as much objective information as I can**<br /><br />I received my order quickly and I did receive the \\"Acoustic\\" version of the VOX amPlug. However, the acoustic effect doesn't work at all on my unit and the fading effect only raises or lowers the volume of static interference. I can still use the unit with my guitar's original tone so it's not totally useless, but it was enough for me to contact the seller who made everything right. Thanks again to InstrumentPro. I recommend them as a seller to anyone who likes prompt and complete customer service.<br /><br />With the exception of the things listed above the unit was as described. The case feels solid and I didn't feel like the plug would snap off unless I really wanted it to. Also the plug fit flush and snug in my Epi Les Paul standard. I docked 2 stars for the 2 listed issues.<br /><br />**I want to make it clear that I'm not 100% certain if these are known issues or if this is simply a defective unit**
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Straightforward game with ratings for good times and a lot of levels.  lots to like. Plus after playing a little I was rewarded with some $ for mp3 downloads. Not so sure how that works, but I liked it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A perfect picture of the reality of service life, albeit from the strongest side of it.  So many one word descriptions of this life can be seen in the book: training, waiting, suffering, victorious, unappreciated, silence, exhaustion, and more. Should be read by those who have a desire to enter the military.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|seems to work well, haven't had any problems with it.  Highly recommend! It does what it is supposed to, does not get in my way or mess up my screens; I just think it is a very fine product.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I read this book a couple weeks ago and I have since re-read the book and I am still torn on whether I liked the book or not. There were definitely parts I enjoyed, but there certainly were parts I would have never expected from reading the preview. I find it hard to beleive that Travis came so far is seemingly such a short amount of time. He came 180 degrees for Abby and it didn't feel like she made many changes for Travis. I did enjoy Travis and Abby's relationship when they were doing well, but it was a disaster when it was going bad. I absolutely adored Travis's dad and found the interaction between him and Abby heartwarming. I found Parker to be an incredible d-bag and I can not imagine any girl wanting to date him.<br /><br />I also found the time line to be scattered and it tried to pack too many things into such a short period of time, the beginning thru Thanksgiving).<br /><br />After reading many other books that Amazon recommends based on this book purchase, I must say this one disappointed me the most. I will admit, however, I will be purchasing Walking Disaster, because I am interested in seeing this story from Travis' perspective.
0525953728|5.0|Really could not put this down, finished it in 2 days.  Without getting into the debate of this guy breaking code, it was a very interesting book.  I enjoyed reading this guys journey to the UBL mission as much as the chapters on the mission itself.  It is amazing and inspiring reading about the kind of guys that got to this point and the years of dedication, training and missions they go through.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am not a big reader but finished this book in 2 days.  Entertaining and informative.  Those of us not in the special forces will never know exactly what happened, but for the Government to want to bring the author up on charges must mean he is too close to exactly what happened.  What the White House has leaked, long before this book was written, does not pass the smell test, compared to this first hand account.  The Government(White House)has refusd to release reports on a U.S. border patrol agents death from the \\"Fast and Furious\\" tells us alot more about this administration.  Read this book. I hope we have more of these type of actions in the works to help keep America safe. God Bless the brave men and women protecting The Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.  God help and bless the U.S.A.
B0072OFOM6|3.0|Where do I begin...the first four episodes of Vengence lack any excitement or interest. And who wrote this crap? They all speak like a cross between british robots and Shakespeare actors . The writers should be fired! Season one and the prequel are very good but this Vengence season did not have the edge of your seat thrill ride like season one or the prequel. The story lines in Vengence were so weak and so was the acting, but then again I'd have to blame it on the writing, which I don't believe the actors could have delivered it any other way. And last but not least, the new Spartacus is not believable at all. He tries to talk like he's authoritative but it comes off as hokey and corny. And what's with everyone having to yell every time they swing a sword? This season left me disappointed. I didn't even recognize who most of the characters were supposed to be, since they seemed to have changed pretty much everyone from season one. Just rediculous.  If I only had a dollar for every time someone said \\"put to purpose\\".

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is by far one of my favorite books. The story is about a bold, sarcastic teenager named Hazel Grace Lancaster whom has been struggling with Cancer for the past few years. Her life has been impacted greatly by the Cancer and has left her with bum lungs, puffy cheeks, and an increasing state of depression. At her painfully boring support group meetings, she meets two people that change her life considerably, the lovesick, blinded Isaac and the one-legged (but still overwhelmingly attractive) Augustus Waters. Their story is followed as they ask the biggest questions life has to offer, and as they learn, through ultimate love and untimely loss.<br /><br />I kept thinking while reading this book how great it would be to use in a secondary English classroom. The many themes found within the novel would be very beneficial to high school students whether or not they are suffering from a health impairment. Hazel and her friends have the same questions as many young people about life and death, their curiosity is just more urgent. They are incredibly relatable characters, and John Green helps the reader to understand sickness in an entirely new and personal way. TFIOS is written so that the reader can grasp at what Hazel's life is like, living with her sickness. It depicts the hardships resulting from such an illness or impairment, including: family stress, changes in school environment, the exhaustion of having a physical condition, and yet, how beautiful opportunities may always take place. This inspiring novel expresses to the young reader that people are people, disability or not, and that anyone is capable of an adventure.<br /><br />Although others in society (parents, old friends, etc.) treat Hazel differently because she wheels around oxygen with her and wears a cannula, her friends Isaac and Augustus and she share a special bond through their impairments and similar interests. Their abruptness about the likelihood of death is shocking, but would be useful to generate thought-provoking classroom discussions about how to lead a fulfilling life and what it must be like to have a much more immediate sense of death at such a young age. What's great about The Fault in Our Stars is that it isn't a book ABOUT disabilities or cancer, but instead the meaning of this short experience we call \\"life\\" that we as individuals are constantly seeking. The characters just happen to be dealing with various forms of disease while they tackle life's greatest questions and explore what the world has to offer. Their responses do reflect their situations, but all the more useful for young adults to compare their ideas with those of peers whom live such a drastically different life.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This a great app and I was highly anticipating the new print function in the new update. Unfortunately it does not work on the Fire. It worked perfect on my HTC Rezound phone but won't pull up the Google cloud print account I have set up and used many times with my phone! Please fix and I will rate higher.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is one of the greatest reads I've ever read. With a combination of beauty, happiness, pain, and hope, it tells an amazing story. Told from Death's point of view, Nazi Germany is plagued with tragedy, but with one girl, Liesel, life gets better. Though it's only one story of the millions that have been through the horrific events, it has vivid detail and a stunning storyline. I laughed and cried all throughout the story, and I felt so much emotional turmoil reading it. It has lots of foreshadowing, dark themes and lighthearted tones, but it's fantastic book. I think someone with a high reading ability would very much enjoy this book, but the language is good enough so that anyone could read it. Since the subject matter is very intense, there are some situations and minuscule amount of language that I would not recommend to 9-year-olds. I'd keep a box of tissues ready.
B0000V6SOG|5.0|If you liked this movie and the music, you want this version with \\"Billy Mac\\" feature song!  Only shortcoming it that it doesn't have the Bay City Rollers 'Bye Bye Baby' track
B006AZZPCM|1.0|this used to be the best app ever, now it cant play any videos. I've un and reinstalled it multiple times and its just crap
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy is wonderful. The story line is good, predictable perhaps but it's easy to get caught up in the characters and their tales. How will they get it together? Who could make this relationship work?<br />And of course the sexual tension is a big part of the story.<br />I couldn't put the trilogy down, even when I had other work to do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Way back when, the app used to take you to the website. Love this new one!! It's so easy to use!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews.  I found A WANTED MAN to meet all of the usual Jack Reacher standards.  Great plot, clues everywhere, and a man on a mission that he didn't intend to have.<br /><br />Since I had a project I was trying to complete this week, so I didn't start the book until Wednesday, even though the project was still incomplete.  I read all afternoon Wednesday, completed some chores, and found myself reading until 3:30am Thursday morning.  I still wasn't finished but I couldn't stay awake any more.  I finished the book on Thursday morning and wish I could start all over again.  Needless to say its time to get back to the project.<br /><br />I thought the tension built throughout the first 1/3 of the book and then was like a boulder that you were chasing down a hill (or maybe it was chasing you) for the final 2/3.<br /><br />If you are a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan, then go for it and judge for yourself.

630469654X|4.0|My wife turned me on to this movie.  She watched it a lot as a youth in Brazil.<br />We were lucky enough to find a copy at the local library.  Well worth requesting a copy.<br /><br />The basic movie is about  a fairytale like curse placed on a couple.  One turns into a wolf at night<br />and one into a hawk during the the day.  You don't get a fuller understanding of the curse and who<br />placed it on them until about 1/3 to half the way through the movie.<br /><br />The movie includes several very well known actors and starts out with Matthew Broderick (just before his Ferris Bueller fame[[ASIN:B001D0DQUC Ferris Bueller's Day Off]])<br />as a prisoner escaping the evil Bishop of Aquila (John wood)<br />Soon we get to meet Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fairytale couple with the cure.<br />From there is the adventure to remove the cure and get revenge.<br /><br />What is so good about this film?  Well for one it is clean compared to some period type films [[ASIN:B005IAVJB6 Name Of The Rose]], [[ASIN:B000NQRE0K Braveheart (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]], etc.<br />The story is one of good verses evil, light and dark, and true love.<br />Full of knights in shining armor, beautiful horses and plenty of people in distress.<br />The music at times is very eighties, and the costumes a bit over the top.<br />There is some fighting.  And the sword play is a little cheesy.  The swords don't seem very legit at one point in the film.<br />Overall the locations, castles, and towns are as good as any film.<br /><br />Interestingly, the bad guys are all dressed in white and the good guy is in black.  Draw your own conclusions about that.<br /><br />You feel good at the end of the movie as things get resolved, the cure is broken and the thief mends his ways.  You begin to really pull for the main characters.<br /><br />This is definitely a film you can see with your children.  Not super young ones but, 8 years and up though it does have a PG-13 rating.  You might havesome explaining to do since traditionally good authority figures are the bad guys in this movie.<br /><br />If you like or have any of the following films you will like this one.  Truly a film for the whole family with clean fun had all around.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CXDD Willow (Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B004QSQML8 Legend (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00006ZXSK Ever After - A Cinderella Story]]<br />[[ASIN:0783225814 Dragonheart - Collector's Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:B0013FSXSC First Knight (Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B0011U52E2 Enchanted (Full Screen Edition)]]
B008PE9GSA|4.0|While not exactly a return to their peak albums (Tres Hombres, Fandango), this album is better than i thought it would be. It's easily the best ZZ Top album since the criminally overlooked Rhythmeen album. The 'Top are rocking harder than they have in a long time, in fact i like this alot more than the wimpy (but popular) Afterburner record. If you were disappointed by Antenna, XXX, and the truly awful Mescalero albums, La Futura will satisfy. By the way, when is Rhino or another wonderful label going to re-release the first two albums and Tejas remastered with the original drum sound? Last thing. Billy Gibbons,one of the greatest guitarists ever, please do an instrumental album.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This trilogy has a unique and compelling story line. There were many unexpected twists in the story, which kept the read interesting. The ending, while probably the most probable, left me feeling like our heroine does not get her due. That said, other parts of the ending were exactly what I wanted and expected. An excellent read that won't disappoint.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The most wonderful app. I can find things, take notes, listen to the word of God. I just can't say enough.
0756697875|5.0|If you have a Lego and Batman fan in your house, buy this book now!  The minifigre is super cute of Batman's electric suit and the contents of the book are outstanding.  The book features very detailed pictures of all the sets and figures since 2006 to present.  There is also cross section pictures of the vehicles so young builders might be able to get some ideas on the building process.  Plus there is a huge comic book style story in the middle with fantastic photos of the figures and scenes.  The pictures are outstanding and so clear and detailed.  There is also a section on how the video game was made.  Basically anything related to Lego Batman is in this book.  I cannot wait to give it as a gift!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|you can find just about anything on pintrest. great for the mom looking for fun activities or someone on a budget trying to find diy solutions for less. I have three step kids 8,9, and 13 and I can find anything I need to keep them busy. to create them clothes out of old shirts. and have info to go to for when I decide to have a baby. what could make it better! a place where I can find all this and more. I love pintrest and recommend it to everyone. I do wish you had the option to move pins and not repin and delete the other one. still worthy of a 5 star.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It's 2:30 a.m. and I am halfway through the book.  I can't put it down - it's that good.  Having read through some of the other reviews, it occurs to me that I may change my mind by the time I get to the end, but I remain optimistic.

034580404X|3.0|*Warning - may contain spoilers on all three books*<br /><br />I am torn about how I feel about these books.  The heroine, Ana Steele irritated the living crap out of me.  Her constant \\"oh my\\" and \\"jeez\\" and her \\"inner goddess doing the salsa\\" left the dialogue stale and adolescent.  But what made me really mad was that she was written to be a head strong woman but then she can't seem to stand up for herself and is totally lacking in self confidence and self esteem.<br /><br />Christian, on the other hand, is one effed up douche.  He is a wealthy, obscenely handsome, manipulative, controlling emotional time bomb who uses sex to cope with his own personal self-loathing.  What makes the whole thing hard to swallow is that Ana accepts this as something she can change and fix and \\"bring him into the light\\". WTF??<br /><br />There's a line that is said in the third novel where Ana says to herself while she's accepting a \\"punishment\\" in the playroom - \\"this is not love, this is revenge.\\" Then why on earth would you stay with someone who claims they love you but then constantly treats you badly?  Sounds like an abusive relationship to me.<br /><br />On the flipside, I was addicted to the storyline.  James keeps the reader engaged since, (unrealistically I might add since if any of us had this much drama in one week, we would all run for the hills and live in solitude) where Christian and Ana ends up having a new drama(s) unfold each and every day in a formula that becomes clear - major drama, fight, sex and make up (rinse and repeat).  Sometimes this formula is used several times a day, which is completely insane. It amazed me how these characters were able to find time to work in such high profile positions since it seemed like they had sex three, four, five times a day. And yes, the sex eventually got boring and repetitive.  I found myself just skipping through them because they always ended in the same way, described in the same way. But it's this dramatic formula thatkept me up nights because something would always be revealed about Christian's past and I was wanted to work my way to the heart of the story - what on earth happened to Christian that made him the man that he is in the novels.<br /><br />The ending of the trilogy is totally unrealistic, sappy and again hard to swallow given the emotional baggage that Christian carries.  Personally, I don't think someone can change so dramatically especially in such a short period.  She meets Christian in May and by September they are already married with child. This timeframe is just crazy talk.  No wonder I felt emotionally exhausted and drained after finishing the final book. (I did read all 3 books in 5 days and I don't suggest doing the same)<br /><br />At the end of the day I would like to believe in \\"hearts and flowers\\" and happily ever after. But to give this dichotomous relationship a fairytale ending reveals James's intention - to provide escapism of what we wish could be but not what is reality.<br /><br />*Side note: Yes, the writing is horrific.  But I'm not sold on whether or not James is really that bad of a writer.  There are bonus chapters in the last book that showcases two chapters of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" in Christian's point of view.  When you read them, the writing is not so abhorrent as it was in Ana's voice probably because Christian isn't a bumbling idiot like Ana.

B007SGM084|5.0|I thought this trilogy was wonderful.  It was very unexpected and I ended up liking the second and third books better than the first but you need the first book to see how they got their start with each other.  Wonderful story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's been a while since I have read a book that I think about from the moment I wake up in the morning until the minute I go to bed at night but Gillian Flynn's new novel, 'Gone Girl', left my mind swirling every second I was reading it. It is the most thrilling novel I have read in a long time and I highly recommend it!

B008LZHA3G|5.0|As are many of you, I'm a huge Dylan fan.  I thought his \\"comeback\\" albums of Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft ranked with his best albums.  From there, though, I found him to be slowly declining with the next two subsequent albums.  The Tempest, while not as good as the previously mentioned comeback albums or his best from the 60's (or Blood on the Tracks from the 70's), is still a strong Dylan album and in the top half of his output.  His vocals, the lyrics, and music are strong; stronger than I expected.  Some songs seem to regress into a standard blues/swing progression, but the lyrics and vocals over them are fresh, new, and intriguing.  This is most definitely a Dylan album to add to your collection.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|did not get this app as it got mostly one star from my fellow reviewers yet appears as nearly 5 stars. That just ticked me off and the &quot;intrusive&quot; comments sealed the deal.
0307341550|5.0|Even the Rich Socialites have problems too... Drugs, cutting, and murder... I loved it! At first I didn't know what to expect from this book, but I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. The main character is like the drug addict who comes home from rehab into the same environment- causing her to cling to Sobriety for her dear life!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I highly anticipated this book release and felt disappointed. It is a good book. I read it in 12 hours. There are no secrets or anything major in the book. It is just one SEAL experience, which I can respect. I was only disappointed because I wanted to read the book to see what all the hoopla was about surrounding this book. I think the news hyped this book up too much. But it was honestly a good read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love love love this app. I can search and highlight verses and I can have most Bible versions read to me with the app.  I can now keep up with the prompter at church and some nights when I just can focus anymore I can be read to until I fall asleep and I can do everything with it I could with a paper Bible.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Undoubtably the best thing I've ever seen golden boy Kutcher do. And Natalie Portman was incredible, as she always is in everything she does. As I mentioned, I never do comedy. But I have a weak spot for Natalie, and had some time to kill. And I am so happy I watched this film. Although the screen play is fairly predictable, the actors shine and really bring a smile to your face. The movie was sad, and ridiculously funny. I wrote down some of the one-liners! But in the end, the under-dog wins the girl, even with stiff competition. The movie is uplifting, and leaves you happy and ready to take a chance yourself. Check it out. I liked it, a LOT, and I don't do comedy! I'm a horror fanatic = ) Well....I was. ~Wolf
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator works great!! It is easy to see and use. perfect for my kindle.  wouldn't ask for any changes as its perfect for me.

0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is an excellent book in which a Charlie, a man who is intellectually disabled, undergoes an experimental surgery to become smarter. The surgery appears to be a success at first and Charlie's IQ skyrockets but tragedy strikes when Algernon, a mouse used to test the procedure, begins to lose his increased intelligence at an alarming rate. Charlie begins to race against the clock as he tries to get his life in order while conducting experiments to determine if he will share Algernon's fate. Along the way people's perceptions of Charlie radically change and we learn that there's much more to life than just being smart.<br /><br />The most interesting thing to note about this book is that the writing style changes with Charlie's IQ.  Charlie's vocabulary is very limited at the start of the book. His writing is plagued with misspelling and bad grammar. As his IQ raises his writing becomes more fluent and, little by little, his errors start to disappear. By the middle of the story his style becomes pristine. This shift in writing serves as one of the best transitions I have ever seen.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for a classroom. My focus area is Business but it would be easy to do a cross-class project with an English teacher. At certain intervals in the story I would require students to write in their own virtual journal and have them describe how they were feeling about the story. Then, there would be a writing prompt asking them what they would do if they were Charlie at that point. Good intervals would be right before the surgery, shortly after the surgery, a moral dilemma Charlie encounters later (keeping this as spoiler free as I can), Algernon's loss of intelligence, and right before the end. After finishing the story I would ask my students if they agreed with the decision made at the end and, if they didn't agree, what they would have done differently in that situation. An alternative activity would be to have the students make a newspaper in Microsoft Word about Charlie's operation and then a follow up article set after the story ends.<br /><br />My only word of caution with this book is that is a very emotional ride. I consider this a plus but if you don't like sad stories do not pick up this book. Simply put the book is good because it is sad. Just make sure you have tissues nearby while reading. I know I certainly needed them when all was said and done.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|I'm a big Dylan fan and have all of his albums from the old days and the last fifteen years.  I pre-ordered Tempest and it arrived in a timely manner.  The album is okay, not his best but Dylan at half staff is still better than most.<br /><br />Funny thing is that my laptop computer, which never has trouble reading a CD if it is legit, doesn't recognize any of the information from this CD other than the songs themselves.  It reads as \\"unknown CD\\" and the song titles don't show up either.  Though the songs do play okay.<br /><br />So my question is, is this a legitimate Jack Frost produced CD or a bootleg copy?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|When I first read the blurb of this book, I wasn't sure I'd like it. I've read a lot of 50 Shades/Twilight/Bared To You spin off's, all mixed into one. I've not liked one since as much as I like those three. A lot of them seemed so immaturely written, or the characters were just too immature sounding, or the books were OBVIOUS copies of the originals. I bought this eBook because it was just a few pounds and I was bored.<br /><br />I am a simple girl, I'm 22 and I like books where there's tension, love, protectiveness, danger and then happy endings. I like books that have second and third books after, but I like each book to wrap up well.<br /><br />When I started reading this book I automatically realised it wasn't like the other spin off's I'd read. Don't get me wrong, there was more than enough cringe worthy \\"oh my god that would not happen in real life!\\" moments, but in a good way! I don't read a book for it to be exactly as someone's regular life is - otherwise I'd go sit in my local high street and watch the couples there. I like to read books where things are a bit out of the ordinary (him suddenly falling for her despite it being completely out of character for him, her having some crazy past, him being some super protective guy, her falling for him despite the fact that every one of us knows she should have stayed away). Not everyone likes that, but it really is down to personal taste.<br /><br />Altogether, I finished this book in just over 24 hours, despite having a toddler to run around after. I couldn't put it down and I enjoyed it so much I went straight over and pre-ordered Walking Disaster.<br /><br />If you don't like the Twilight type love stories, where the romance isn't perfect, but that makes it perfect, then this isn't for you. It all ends perfect and over the top for teenagers and the romance aspect of it is something you wouldn't really see much of in real life - but I had a blast reading it and will be reading it again before the next book isout!
B002N2P1SE|5.0|If you are a joss whedon, sci fi, buffy, and or angel fan, you might like dollhouse.<br /><br />The show in its entirety, especially the epitaph episodes, is pretty good. If you are a fan of buffy and angel, you will notice some of the same actors interacting as completely different characters, which is entertaining.<br /><br />Dollhouse deals with the issues that arise once technology makes it possible for human minds/identities could be saved, deleted, and tranferred interchangeably with other humans. The interesting themes, detailed set, and outstanding performances by some of the supporting cast makes the show worthwhile.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I'v been hooked on Vampire stories since Ann Rice's Interview With the Vampire. This one is at the top of my list.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|New favorite book. So descriptive and keeps you hooked. It's a must read.  I like how it's a very different storyline from the typical romance books.
0062004352|3.0|I can't believe I am writing this, it sounds so prudish.  But the amount of drinking that the author describes in this book was really disturbing.  All of the main characters drink to the point of vomiting (or \\"vomming\\", as the central character affectionately refers to it) a couple of times a week.  This in the pursuit of romantic adventure; apparently having the heroines throw up on their shoes is in no way off-putting to the heroes.  I borrowed several of Kelk's books from a friend on holiday, and ALL of them are like this.<br /><br />Is constant binge drinking/puking the new black these days, or am I just out of touch?  And do people really find this an attractive characteristic in a protagonist?<br /><br />Strangely, the books were not badly written otherwise, I just read three of them in a row in a state of bemusement that the author apparently found this to be normal.  I would have enjoyed them much more if I was not waiting for the next bout of vomiting to ensue, though.

034580404X|4.0|Don't have much to say, without giving too much away...this is my first actual review on Amazon! I was just intrigued as every other person who bought these books to get into the \\"hype\\" of the Fifty Shades madness, so I did, read them all...and although I wasn't very impressed through the first half of the first book, I never gave up on them and actually ended up loving them--can't wait for the so-called \\"movie\\" that is supposed to come out!! (:

0525953728|5.0|I normally read Clive Cussler , Tom Clancy & Dan Brown.<br /> Not only is this book Real but it is also written in the style of a great novel like from the blokes above.<br /> I live on the beach here in Thailand with other retired & some military vets & they were sure put out that I had pre ordered the book on Amazon & not told them.<br />I learnt a lesson last night too Mark Owen,, don't take your book for sunset beers with the boys !! Dam near a War to get it back !!<br />Great story, well put together & I think that books like this will do more for the good than what the Brass thinks.<br />Good work mate, Ed
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|Mine worked fine when I first got it, but it stopped working a few hours later. I figured it just needed a good shake, and sure enough, it started right up. Over the next few months, it would occasionally hiccup like that, but after I gave it a shake, it would start again. When I first got it, it kept extremely accurate time (less than +5 secs per week, according to my atomic clock app), but as time went on (ha!), it got progressively worse, until I was losing 8 minutes a week. And 9 mos later, it stopped for good, and no amount of shaking would start it back up. Extremely disappointed, I wish I had read the reviews and seen that this particular seller/watch has had QC issues. Based on this experience, I'm looking for an SKX007J from a different seller.<br /><br />For those who get a good copy, I'm sure it's a great watch, just a note of caution for those looking here.
B000L212HC|5.0|I just finished my second viewing of this movie almost back-to-back. The second viewing is just as good because you can see all the clues and all the foreshadowing you missed the first time around. When i watched this the first time, i was pretty confused as to what just happened. It was on my mind for hours because i was amazed at the conclusion. This whole movie, literally, is a magic trick. If you love psychological thrillers and movies that mess with your head, you surely want to see this. Set in the Victorian Era, two magicians battle it out to become the better magician/illusionist. They will do whatever it takes and you will be surprised as to how far they will go and who comes out on top in the end.<br /><br />I would also recommend other Christopher Nolan films, especially Memento and Inception.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|If you are even somewhat of a mystery/thriller reader, you will be able to put this puzzle together. Kept me turning pgs and/but then before I knew it, the story ended with a predictable ending, and summed up in about two pages with a laughable dialogue (and not in a good way).  Maybe his other books are a bit more satisfying?

B003XT60KO|5.0|This may be the only hardcore economics book I've really ever read. I don't follow through on many books period, but I pushed on through this one. The effort was valuable and worth it. From what I understand, it's held as one of the classics and rightly so. Just take it in chunks as you have time, but do yourself a favor and glean some knowledge from this one.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I think she is a good author.  I was sympathetic to the characters.  But the subject of BDSM is obviously what is selling the book and, frankly, I was bored with the lengthly descriptions of arousal and pain after a time or two.  I do not intend to read the rest of the trilogy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I was not expecting this style of a simplistic puzzle game to have any major improvements over the formula but wow. This has actually been a great game with a lot of creativity through out each puzzle.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|Really enjoyed the movie but the show would get stuck and would not respond so had to go watch something else and come back to it later.  Happened about 6 times.  I watched it the next day with no problems.
B004T0E2S8|1.0|would not have bought this if I realized it didn't have the scrolling fretboard like the Pro version Android/iPhone/Windows/Mac. PLEASE ADD FRETBOARD FOR KINDLE! The Pro Version is awesome. This is just a tab search engine which you can get fot free. It does save tabs for use offline which is good but PLEASE MAKE KINDLE PRO VERSION.
B00932A2MC|2.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  It was horribly written.  The special effects barely made it watchable.
B002RSDW80|5.0|The DVD was shipped with lightning speed. It was sold as used and had a few cosmetic issues. I have a temperamental Blu-Ray player that usually doesn't want to play anything that has a finger print on it, so I was holding my breath the whole time. However, the DVD played like new. Would definitely use this seller again.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I had seen Beginnings and my son had said that Dark Knight was his favorite so I got it from Amazon and did like it.  The only thing I can say is that I wish that Amazon offered sub-titles. I don't like it when I miss something and feel there is a point I don't understand.
0061474355|4.0|Sabriel is a dark and clever tale of a desperate journey to rescue the world from the dead. Garth Nix creates a fantasy of crumbling old magic, reminiscent of the Narnia of [[ASIN:B005Q6MJ8O The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]], pushed up against a mundane background that looks an awful lot like 1940's England (reminding much of the [[ASIN:006447268X Chrestomanci]] world of Diana Wynne Jones.)<br /><br />Sabriel has many familiar elements of the adventure genre, but Nix is extremely clever and original. He paints a bleak picture of a fragile world with ancient magical roots, under siege and falling apart. His depiction of \\"charter magic\\" is a mystic symbolic language that requires both skill and blood talent to invoke - very cool.  Sabriel's quest is life-or-death, with one blood-pounding chase after another (those monsters tend to get REALLY close) - and it's full of unexpected discoveries and surprising failures. As a character, Sabriel is tough and brave. Her goal through most of the book (\\"But I have to find my father!\\") may wear thin on readers (I got impatient for her to step up and rescue the world!) but the family theme - an orphaned teenager, struggling to find herself - is true to character.  Nix's \\"death magic\\" is VERY dark, scary for real -- armies of marching zombies, bones crunching through the dead flesh of their feet making a sounding like hobnailed boots? Eek. Overall this is a thrilling and original take on the YA Fantasy Adventure genre, and I can't wait to jump into the sequel.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is the only 'Alice In Wonderland' that counts. No one can top it for imagination, voices, acting, gags, music, visuals and sheer entertainment.  As close to insanity as the studio ever got in its feature animation. Its more than a classic.

B000AP04FG|4.0|The DVD arrived. I have watched it and works great and I can not believe this site. I wanted to note that this DVD had arrived at my home In Saint Louis, Missouri. Yet it requires more input on the DVD
B005SGMNII|5.0|When the show first came out, I had a regular TV, regular cable and a regular DVD player. Now I have HDTV and a super-powered Blu-Ray player to watch this show's first season on, and it's GREAT. Always makes me laugh
0060801719|4.0|Opening with an epigraph from William Blake (\\"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite\\"), writer Aldous Huxley captures the essence of the effects of an hallucinogen -- in this case, four-tenths of a gram of mescaline dissolved in a glass of water and ingested in May 1953.<br />Essentially, Huxley writes that our conscious mind act as a reducing valve, filtering all but the most essential information necessary to survive, and what's left is relatively unexplored and basically infinite.  Some of his observations are as simple as noting how people consciously or unconsciously put on a self-pleasing countenance while they pose for a photograph -- in short, they adopt an identity they wish to present to the world.<br />Chemically armed for his journey into his own prodigious mind, the well-read Huxley brings the reader along for the ride, tripping on religion, self-identity, self-awareness, and man's place -- both individually and collectively -- in this reality we call life.<br />And the reality is that each drug-fueled trip is subjective and filled with an intense degree of euphoria and paranoia after one takes a bite from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden (probably no different from the mandrakes Adam and Eve consumed as they became aware of their nakedness). The end result could be temporary (or permanent) madness, or contrarily a lifelong acquisition of self-awareness and insight.<br />If you're looking for pregnant prose a la Jim Morrison, this book is not for you. Instead, it is a scholarly treatise from a great mind. Having fried my brain like an egg on LSD and mushrooms to get to the same place as Huxley, I'd recommend saving your neurons and picking up a dictionary before taking a safe, paranoid-free trip with Huxley, who shares many insights during his \\"trip.\\" A short read, but a useful book for those in search of whatever is out there -- or \\"in there.\\"

B000000H4A|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like this album...I like all of King Diamond's albums, including those with Mercyful Fate (although I like KD better).  The eerie tone of the songs, as always, is really cool and unique to King Diamond.  What I don't like as well on this album, and I realize it was the first KD album, is that it doesn't contain a full story throughout, which is one of the things that I most like about KD.  Even if there are some weaker songs on some of their other albums, I can overlook it if it''s within the context of a full-length story.  On here, the lesser songs are just that...lesser songs.  The Spider's Lullabye didn't have a full length story, either, but I consider that a 4 star album simply because the songs are stronger than these (in my opinion, anyway).  The highlights of Fatal Portrait are very good, though, lead by 'The Charon' a heavy rocker which is by far the best song, imo, and followed by the popular 'Halloween' and 'No Presents for Christmas.'  Overall, this is a solid album that I would definitely recommend to all fans of King Diamond...but it's not their best.
B00122LXTM|5.0|Has all of their old classics, plus a half dozen, or so, hidden gems. \\"Dangerous\\" is a great song that you just don't hear played on the radio. $$$ well spent!

B007GCY8FS|4.0|This book was good, but hard to read, kinda boring in spots and fast paced in others, and some of it was just out there. I love jack but something was off in this book for me. Jack seems tired.I wonder how much longer this series will last. I  am way disappointed that a movie is being made. Jack needs no movie!

B008LZHA3G|1.0|I consider myself a Dylan , very much so , I don't claim to have everything  the man ever recorded , but a quick glance at my i-pod tells me i have 39 Dylan albums .<br />I love nearly all of them , but admit that , 'Time out of Mind' / Love & Theft /  and 'Together Through Life , all left me pretty cold , besides for a few exceptional tracks.<br />So , I'm being honest here , I am not a fan of his 'recent' stuff. This is more of the same to my mind . I think his voice is actually wonderful on this album , but where are the melodies ? , every tune here is a re-hash of either his own previous output , or  someone elses , The  Muddy Waters  homage/rip off , take your choice ? , is particularly unwelcome , and just grates .  Tempest, the title track ,  is beyond  boring , pedestrian lyrics over a turgid piece of music  , I for one will never waste another 14 minutes of my life listening to it again.  We also get a couple of aimless 'swing' numbers , which are almost  indistinguishable from the lazy attempts at song writing that we have already suffered through on the aforementioned albums.<br />The rest of the tracks are all pretty similar to one another , where I ask again ,are the musical hooks the the once great man used write with ease ? .  'Uncut' magazine gave this 10 outta 10 , hilarious !. The rest of the music press in the UK , have pretty much as one declared Tempest as a work of genius , I despair .<br />The lyrics do not at any point make you prick up your ears . Is this the same guy  that could leave one  , baffled, angry ,troubled ,smiling, laughing , weeping ... over the course of an album ? ... Simple answer ... NO ! ,  no it's not !<br />i give up , I love his voice though , and these simple , almost non existent songs  do make for  a reasonably satisfying background soundtrack .<br />Personally , I like to give music my full attention  , and this collection failed to grip me for more than a few brief moments at a time.  If any other artist had released this album , it wouldnt be  getting any attention at all.<br />Don't buy it.d this album , it wouldnt be  getting any attention at all.<br />Don't buy it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I really like this game except it is addictive. I start playing and lose track of time.Very fun and its free!!!
B006DZYM0A|3.0|This is basically a movie about a young girl going through a traumatic situation and not getting the proper attention/help to deal with it.  So naturally, she turns to everything else and responds dramatically.  I guess I give it 3 stars because of how real it can be for many.  This is what can happen if you don't get help and it can make life very difficult, as seen in the movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a good book but there is too much hype that goes along with these books.  Compared to most steamy reads I have read better that keep me up all night in suspense.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is very good and well made. I don't agree much with the subject matter, but I appreciate the quality of it. I read the book first, so I think my prior knowledge gave me more insight than people who think it's just about kids killing kids.
1934356557|5.0|Bill:<br /><br />I am currently studying and training to take (and pass) a Microsoft SQL Server developers certification exam.  I'm using the book \\"Murach's SQL Server 2008 for developers\\" as a study and training guide.  While searching for a book that delves deeper into the subject of database design and normalization, I managed to stumble across your excellent book.  After spending some time reading your first chapter, \\"Jaywalking,\\" I made an instant on-the-spot decision to buy your book.<br /><br />It occurs to me that I might as well learn MySQL concurrently with SQL Server since the two dialects have much in common.  Also, your \\"Antipatterns\\" book appears to be one of the best practical treatises on the subject of normalization and database design currently on the market, so it just makes sense to load up your bug tracking example database (on my SQL Server Express instance) and intensively study your book in lieu of the limited material on normalization and database design in the Murach book.  I'm not a genius, but it occurs to me that sound database design is the key to everything else.  With a good [properly normalized] database structure, queries, views, et cetera ... are more efficient and easier to build, design, and maintain.  Your book is very good at making this clear.  (Actually, I think of your book as a treasure trove of good information.)

B000085RPU|1.0|When I ordered this product I was very new to ordering DVD's. I ordered this product as a present, when the receiving party got it home, it wouldn't play. Come to find out it was because it was formatted for the UK. I am in the U.S.  I had not idea about regions. It should be much clearer as to where the DVD's are formatted. Plus, when I sent it back they gave me back money for the movie, but none on shipping, after I had already sent it, they emailed me to tell me it had to be sent off a different way also. Very unsatisfied!

0061124958|4.0|I was 10. The year I was in fith grade I was assigned to read this book. This was the greatest decision my 5th grade teacher chose for us kids. At night I would stay up late flipping through the pages just being so into this world of animals and great, great literature. When the last page was flipped by yearning for more was not yet diminished. As time went on I realized that that book is complete in itself and tells a brilliant, heartwarming story which will be in the hearts of those who read it forever. All I can say is happy 60th anniversary Charlotte's Web.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I didn't think this show would appeal to me at first- there's a lot of violence and drugs- obviously. But this show is so well done.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Gone Girl is a wonderful read, well written with amazing characters.<br />The ending ...  we had quite a discussion (my friend and I who both read it at the same time).
0812548094|3.0|I really wish that there were half stars on Goodreads but alas, there isn't.  So instead of two and a half, I gave this book three stars.  I'm really torn about it though, I don't think it's on the same caliber of many of the other books that I gave three stars.  Only the fact that the story was interesting bumped it up that little bit extra.<br /><br />The overall story was what moved my rating but there were several finer points about the writing that I didn't like.  This story is pretty interesting, as was the first book of this series, but in a lot of ways it feels contrived or \\"borrowed\\" from other series.  I found a lot of similarities with The Wheel of Time in several places throughout the story which quite annoyed me.  I don't want to read a story I've already read.  Nor do I want to feel like the story is being moved on just for the sake of being moved on.  If there's no natural flow, it feels fake and to me this book felt that way.<br /><br />Additionally, there were several flaws in the writing that I found frustrating for a writer who has attained the level of fame that Goodkind has.  The one that mainly sticks out to me is that there is a point in this story where Khalan is riding a horse through a crowded war camp.  Not only is she able to pull a sword from a sheath at full gallop, but she is able to use it to amazing efficiency on horseback.  But that's not bad enough.  I can believe that adrenaline does that to people but what I can't believe is that a warhorse, running at a full out gallop rips tent stakes from the ground with his legs.  Horses legs are the most fragile part of their bodies; if you ran a horse, even a heavy war horse, through ropes like that, it would likely snap his legs.  The rope wouldn't give way.  If the stakes were pulled out of the ground, they would have wrapped around his legs and tripped him at best or punctured his sides at worse.  Common sense doesn't need to be abandoned to write fantasy.<br /><br />Again, Goodkind feels the need to push his views onto the reader.  There are some that I agree with but at the same time it is poor writing to be so obvious with your views.  It detracts from the story when it becomes a social narrative.  Deep metaphors work far better than a surface veneer over an issue.<br /><br />On that same note, he constantly talks about how Richard is this wonderful, gentle character when in reality he is a pretty much an arrogant jerk throughout this entire novel.  Several times, he berates characters for their religious beliefs (the Mud People, the Bantak, the Sisters of Light).  The funny thing is that he talks about how narrow minded the Sisters of Light are.  It's ironic that he talks about how narrow minded they are without ever noticing his own hypocrisy.  That is far from a gentle, loving, wonderful character that he is portrayed as.<br /><br />There are characters who act completely out of character for themselves or who change their minds suddenly about something.  I found more problems than things to praise in this book.  Again, there are far better epic series out there.s the need to push his views onto the reader.

B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have this app on my Evo 3D. Lately, I have been using my Kindle Fire more than my laptop. I am still learning my Kindle Fire and very pleased with it so far. Anyway, I received an email with an attachment and didn't know if I could print from my Kindle Fire. Did a quick search on the Internet and saw that people have printed from the KF using a different printing app. I decided to check Amazon's app store and the HP ePrint app was at the top of the list. I downloaded  it within seconds. Once I downloaded the app, I went to the email, selected the attachment, chose the Hp ePrint app, and my document started to print right away. I am very satisfied with this app. This is definitely a 10*  app.

0525953728|5.0|I saw \\"Mark Owen\\" on 60 Minutes last Sunday and was duly impressed by his demeanor and humility. The book was an additional reflection of the same character. I am honored to be an American and call Mark and his buddies \\"brothers\\". I downloaded the Kindle version late last night and read until I couldn't keep my eye open. I finished the book today and have to tell you that the writing is excellent. The stories are so down to earth and their willingness to give their all for our country is heart warming. I am glad to know that there are plenty of dedicated, expertly trained, well-equipped warriors who are at the ready to respond and defend our constitutional freedoms.<br /><br />Interesting to note: I knew there was a difference in training and skill between Seal Teams and wasn't sure if Team Six really existed. Now I understand BUD/s training makes you are Seal and earns you a Trident. Green Team is nine more months of rigorous training and learning to operate in the worst conditions with precision and skill. Being a Seal is no small honor, being a Team Six operator takes it up a few notches.<br /><br />Only a certain breed can dare make those sacrifices and I for one thank God for such heroes. Thanks for all veterans of every stripe and level of service. I am proud of you and thank you again for your service.
B002UWH8SS|5.0|I've tried watching SG1 and never could get into it, but with Stargate Universe it's a whole ballgame now. The series reminds me of the best parts of the new BSG series. More gritty and believable than the previous Stargate series.

B0080YGZ20|5.0|Vows is an eclectic collection of songs by the young Artist Kimbra. She is beautiful, talented, humble and extremely musical. I highly recommend this album. She is my favorite artist of 2012, since I found out about her this year. I was sad that she was overlooked at the grammy's and Music Video Awards.
0316017930|4.0|I have read all of Malcom Galdwell's books. They are fascinating and engaging. His books are a series of different stories with a similar theme. I learned a LOT from his latest book \\"The Outliers.\\" It contains secrets to success that actually make sense - the 10,000-hour rule was eye-opening. Wait until you read about WHY the best hockey players in Canada usually were born in the first three months of year.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|What can I say. If you have grown up in a cave you could have missed this. I hope not. This is by far one of the ten best albums ever released. The music is hypnotic, the lyrics soulful, the album is a journey. Although King Crimson went on in various lineups for over thirty years, they never were able to repeat this masterpiece. I think the loss of Greg Lake was devastating, although we all got the gift of Emerson, Lake and Palmer from that departure. This is an album that begs to be listened to over and over. If you have never heard this, do not miss this classic. These are the pioneers of progressive rock from which all others should pay homage. This should be in every collection, along with The beach Boys Pet Sounds, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, The Bee Gees Odessa, Michael Jackson's Thriller, Boston's First Self-Titled abum, and The Who's Tommy. Expand your horizons...

B008MZPUXW|5.0|Neil Halstead has and continues to be one of the best singer/songwriters on the planet and on his new record, Palindrome Hunches, he continues to showcase his talents.  The album has some similarities to his first two solo records, but Palindrome is a bit darker and his use of the piano and violin on many of the songs adds an interesting twist to the album.<br /><br />The album does not jump out at you the way the previous two did and there are not a lot of catchy, upbeat songs on the record but having listened to it five times through I find myself enjoying it more and more everytime I listen to it.  If you are a fan of Neil Halstead from his Mojave 3 and Slowdive days, this album is a must for you.  You will not be disappointed.
B004W648Y2|5.0|'Arthur' is definitely an essential rock and roll album for anyone's collection.  By far, the Kinks have a huge catalog that's largely uncelebrated when compared to the likes of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.  Yet, they produced absolute masterpieces such as this.  How can it be?!<br /><br />This was the first Kinks album I ever owned and it truly paved the way for the band's voyage to my heart.  It's as if every song on the album becomes a sing-along of sorts.<br /><br />Definitely one of the greatest rock albums of all time!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|After much debate, I decided t buy this flash. The rationale for me, I am not professional photographer, so I don't need to spend much on high end lights like 910. Also at the same point of time, I needed better than average light. This flash light perfectly fits the bill.<br /><br />Nikon cameras are known as the best camera for Flash Photography, well adding this light certainly proves that.<br /><br />The features I like - it shuts off automatically after certain idle time (which saves a lot of battery power), can be operated in varios modes (Master, Additional), automatically adjusts to zooming of the lens.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for balanced flash light.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|This is a great disc for the devoted Pink Floyd fan and the casual fan alike. With the resurgence of their popularity over the past ten years this disc can serve as a great introduction to the incredible sound and range of this group of very talented musicians. It kicks open the door and makes you want more. If you have never truly doscovered Pink Floyd, sit back, give a listen, and immediately order Dark Side of the Moon, and the Wall afterward; then you will be as hooked as the rest of us. David Gilore has an incredible disc as a solo [[ASIN:B00136RZUI On An Island]]act called \\"On an Island\\". There is so much more to discover after this, but let this be your introduction, or you memory jogger. Either way, it is great.......

141935972X|2.0|When we last saw Claire and Jaime and the gang, Claire had just finished telling her story about Jaime and Scotland to her daughter, Brianna, and a researcher, Roger. They decide to find out what happened to Jaime. Apparently, he did NOT die in the Battle of Culloden...but is he still alive in the 1760's? And does Claire want to leave behind her life in the 1960's--including her beloved daughter--to return to a man who may not love her anymore?<br /><br />The Outlander series has been an emotional roller coaster ride for me. I wasn't a big fan of Outlander, but I figured I'd give Dragonfly in Amber a chance. WOW, that book was amazing, and it ended on one helluva cliffhanger. Pretty much since then, I have been ITCHING to start reading \\"Voyager\\"--the biggest drawback has been (besides nabbing an audiobook version from the library) the length.<br /><br />Well, I finally had a chance (between all the Book Club books I've been reading) so I jumped upon the chance to listen to Davina Porter transport me back to Claire and Scotland and Jaime...only what I ended up getting was certainly not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I see it this way: if you go into this expecting just about anything to happen, you will do fine. If you don't mind voodoo magic, racist portrayals of all races, lots of lying between a couple that supposedly loves and trusts one another, and a 15 year old boy kidnapped and raped by a much older woman, then you will probably find this book up your alley. Unfortunately, that was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />Part of what bothered me were the characters themselves. You would think when a person ages, that person would become more confident in themselves, more stubborn and less likely to take crap from people. But I didn't find Claire to be that way at all. Instead, she puts up with things I wouldn't have even bothered with (more in a bit). And Claire sure makes her decision to time hop back to the 18th century easily. Isn't there a conflict about the way women are treating back then in comparison to how she is treated in the 1960's? Isn't she afraid or worried about losing her life or identity? By the way it doesn't even cross her mind, I guess not, it's all about a man and being back with him. Jaime has always been a protective husband, but here he blatantly lies or withholds the truth from Claire. He comes across as domineering, jealous, and hypocritical. Oh, yeah, and everyone wants him, INCLUDING MEN. Brianna is such a Mary Sue. Beautiful hair, long legs, spitfire, \\"smart\\", can charm people without even having to work at it, bland personality. Practically every male gets a hard-on just looking for her. Frank turns into Cheater McAdulterer@$$. Not that I exactly blame him; he and Claire had a very rocky relationship, one that she didn't exactly help along. There is a Mr. Willoughby, a Chinese male who is hideously stereotyped. And I'm not saying that the characters say stereotypical or racist things about him; no, his entire CHARACTER is one racial stereotype after another. EMBARRASSING. There were loads and loads of other characters, but honestly, I can barely remember them (or their character seemed pointless).<br /><br />Now, I will say I do like how Claire and Jaime are having these adventures and they aren't some young teenaged punks. They are mature adults, in their forties/fifties. That's awesome and I highly applaud this move. However, I doubt that a 50-year-old Claire would be THAT highly desired by nearly every male she comes across.<br /><br />One of the things that drove me most nuts was the Jaime/Claire relationship. The problem I had with it was this: Jaime and Claire have been apart for 20 years, and yet they barely spend any time getting to know each other again or having ANY problems getting back together. They have an awkward night together, have amazing sex, and POW! They are an item. I would think that after 20 years, they would have changed drastically--maybe they were more or less serious, or had different interests, or had grown more mature. But it doesn't seem that either Jaime or Claire had to struggle much to \\"get\\" the other.<br /><br />And this leads into the next part: Jaime lies or withholds the truth on at least TWO occasions and both times Claire swallows the apology and moves on with barely a blip. The first time this happens, Jaime doesn't tell Claire that he has a wife. This isn't a mere oversight; he spends quite a few days with her, and she has to find out when his second wife bursts into his home at Lallybroch. They have a brief spat, she leaves, he gets shot, she runs back, they kiss and make up, happily ever after. NO! This is UNACCEPTABLE. He should NOT LIE ABOUT A SECOND WIFE. No matter how much he didn't \\"LOVE\\" her or some bull.<br /><br />The second incident is about Jaime's son, Willy. That is yet another blowout that Claire learns AGAIN from someone else. And yet AGAIN, barely a blip, and then Claire and Jaime are back to clawing at each other's clothes.<br /><br />And lastly, you mean to tell me these two people, who spent TWENTY YEARS apart, didn't find ONE SINGLE PERSON in those twenty years to FALL IN LOVE with and marry? I know that Gabaldon was trying to make it seem like the love Jaime and Claire had for each other was eternal and blah blah blah, but geesh, I just don't buy it. I can't imagine that Claire would have remained chaste for twenty years (what was up with the Frank/Claire intimate scene after Brianna's birth? Did they reconcile or no?). Same for Jaime.<br /><br />Plotwise, be open for anything to happen. And I mean ANYTHING. I'm talking shipwrecks (at least two), ocean-crossings, seasickness, VOODOO CEREMONIES AND TALKING TO BRIANNA FROM BEYOND TIME, child rape, a child being kidnapped, imprisonment, smuggling, piracy, a slave trade market (including a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE scene proving the \\"breeding qualities\\" of a black man--absolutely DREADFUL), drunken and high priests, everyone and his mother knowing Jaime or being from Scotland, plucky prostitutes, and more. Honestly, I had no idea what would happen at any time, because Gabaldon would just pick something out of the Plot Ideas Hat and toss it into the mix.<br /><br />And final pet peeve, I swear. A good portion of this novel involves Jaime and Claire racing to the Caribbean to find the missing Ian, their nephew. Only, they have plenty of time to bumble around, getting Fergus and his wife married, cavorting with drunken priests and more WHILE A CHILD IS BEING MOLESTED. And the worst part is, Jaime and Claire rarely seem to be that affected by this. They don't worry about what is happening to Ian. They don't stay up late at night, wondering where he is and what to do. No, instead, it's business as usual--hijinks and adventure and plenty of hot, hot, hot sex to boot.<br /><br />I know this has been harsh review, and I really hate to be this way, particularly about a book that I was so anticipating. But I can't help but be honest about how the book affected me. I really did want to like--no, love--this book. I was excited to go back to Scotland. I was chomping at the bit to have Claire and Jaime reunite. And if I hadn't cared about the story, about the characters, I don't think I would have bothered so much with this review.<br /><br />This book (series) has loads of fans; if you've already read the first two books, then I do recommend reading this, just so you can see Jaime and Claire reunite. And hey, you may end up liking this more than I did. And even though I didn't much care for this book, I'm still gonna give Drums of Autumn a chance--eventually.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|I read all three books and must admit that I was engaged whilst reading the first book. The other two books didnt really grip me as much and I think more of a story is needed. I did appreciate the bad guy turned good but I think thats were the predicatability came in and where the excitement was lost.
B005TZFZJC|1.0|I'm really trying to understand how repeating \\"we found love in a hopeless place\\" literally 45 times with a long techno break is an actual song. Her voice is auto tuned to the point where she sounds robotic. Clearly, these albums are about getting hits and she has no artistic integrity, otherwise she would actually write, arrange and produce these pathetic excuses for albums. She can't be on tour, party, film a movie, do fashion and perfume, and write music. She doesn't write this crap but people still defend every lackluster performance, lazy routine, offkey vocal and mind numbing repetitive lyric. It's sex, sex, sex and then ask for sympathy right before a single comes out. Then she changes her hair color or hair style before a new recycled album is released before the holiday season. She is awful, just awful.

B0030B624E|2.0|Great movie... My beef is with Amazon. In the description it reads \\"download in 2 locations, compatible with Mac & Windows PC, & format streaming and digital download\\". But can I download this onto my computer? No. The one place where you would think a person would be able to download a movie they buy... My job requires me to be away from home over the weekends and with no interent - I thought I would watch this video this weekend, but I can't. I paid $7 for a video that I can't even have and watch at my own convenience when I want and where I want. So, if you don't mind only being able to watch this on Amazon, I say go for it, otherwise, I recommend buying a used one (probably for less) from hastings.
B000003CKH|2.0|I bought this cd for a couple of songs which are cool, the rest are below average. The group, like so many from the past to present, tries to hard to be anti-hip. They become just a bunch of clanging noise. But hey, they're going the distance...<br />Oh wait, they tried and didn't make it.
1419381032|2.0|When we last saw Claire and Jaime and the gang, Claire had just finished telling her story about Jaime and Scotland to her daughter, Brianna, and a researcher, Roger. They decide to find out what happened to Jaime. Apparently, he did NOT die in the Battle of Culloden...but is he still alive in the 1760's? And does Claire want to leave behind her life in the 1960's--including her beloved daughter--to return to a man who may not love her anymore?<br /><br />The Outlander series has been an emotional roller coaster ride for me. I wasn't a big fan of Outlander, but I figured I'd give Dragonfly in Amber a chance. WOW, that book was amazing, and it ended on one helluva cliffhanger. Pretty much since then, I have been ITCHING to start reading \\"Voyager\\"--the biggest drawback has been (besides nabbing an audiobook version from the library) the length.<br /><br />Well, I finally had a chance (between all the Book Club books I've been reading) so I jumped upon the chance to listen to Davina Porter transport me back to Claire and Scotland and Jaime...only what I ended up getting was certainly not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I see it this way: if you go into this expecting just about anything to happen, you will do fine. If you don't mind voodoo magic, racist portrayals of all races, lots of lying between a couple that supposedly loves and trusts one another, and a 15 year old boy kidnapped and raped by a much older woman, then you will probably find this book up your alley. Unfortunately, that was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />Part of what bothered me were the characters themselves. You would think when a person ages, that person would become more confident in themselves, more stubborn and less likely to take crap from people. But I didn't find Claire to be that way at all. Instead, she puts up with things I wouldn't have even bothered with (more in a bit). And Claire sure makes her decision to time hop back to the 18th century easily. Isn't there a conflict about the way women are treating back then in comparison to how she is treated in the 1960's? Isn't she afraid or worried about losing her life or identity? By the way it doesn't even cross her mind, I guess not, it's all about a man and being back with him.

B00428ZRFE|1.0|This album is terrible. It's pop fluff full of auto tuned filler. She says the same thing over and over...\\"Oh, yeah, nah, eh, baby, lah, ooh.\\" I mean come on...How can people think this album is good and how did she win Grammy's for songs that she didn't write, barely sang, and sounds empty, are meaningless and trashy. Music is dead.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I read several very favorable reviews of this album and was convinced that I would be dissappointed like I was with \\"Together Through Life\\".  I was wrong; Tempest is an excellent album.  Is it among Bob's very best all-time albums - no, but IMO it's far superior to TTL, better and more consistent than \\"Modern Times\\" and close to his modern classics, \\"Love and Theft\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\".  I played TTL once when I brought it home a few years ago and never again.  I listened to every song on Tempest four consecutive times last night (about 4 and half hours); awoke this morning and the first thing I did was listen to the 14-minute \\"Tempest\\"....again.  By the way, there is a guy on YouTube that has an excellent cover of this song already posted.  Tempest, Tin Angel, Pay in Blood and Soon After Midnight are my favorites in that order.  Only, Roll On John dissappoints. Sounding a bit forced and contrived, it's not up to same level of quality as the rest of the songs.

0395925037|5.0|I decided to read MEIN KAMPF as the result of reading the books and seeing the films ATLAS SRUGGED and THE FOUNDTAINHEAD by Any Rand.  I came to the conclusion that Rand didn't understand the difference between Marxism and Fascism.  Clearly, her concern was state-controlled capitalism (Fascism) and not the absence of a free-market economy (Marxism).  Highly educated people often confuse the two political philosophies because of the social oppression that undergirds both of them.  As for me, any ambiguities between the two philosophies were resolved after reading MEIN KAMPF (I read DAS KAPITAL while in college).  Three critical issues emerged from my reading.  These include 1) Hitler's level of intelligence and his command of the written word; 2) What he ACTUALLY said (which if not the same thing as what people say he said); and 3) His influence on politics and political propaganda in contemporary American society.<br /><br />1) After reading MEIN KAMPF, there can be no doubt that Hitler was an extremely intelligent man.  The general public often confuses education and psychosis with intelligence.  There is no significant association.  Although Hitler embarrassingly admits that he never obtained what we would call a high school diploma and his failure to be admitted to architecture school, he was well-read* and had a supreme command of the written and oral word.  Once one reads MEIN KAMPF, it becomes easy to understand how his contemporaries became Jew-haters and blindly follow his dictates.<br /><br />As a budding scholar (many years ago), I was taught that the most effective strategy to establish a complex position is to express the salient points in a list-like manner.  People like to read lists (which is what I am doing in this review).  This is exactly what Hitler did.  Writing by lists, keeps the reading audience attentive.  In addition, his vocabulary is nothing less than magnificent!  Anyone who knows pre-World War II German history, will be able connect the enthusiasm and attraction of MEIN KAMPF among the non-Jewish German population.<br /><br />2) I have heard MANY times, that Hitler's plan for the \\"final solution\\" was clearly articulated in MEIN KAMPF.  This is simply not true.  Within the pages of MEIN KAMPF, it is clear that Hitler hated Jews and Communism.  His hatred for Communism was profound.  However, his anticommunism perspective emerged because he envisioned Communism as a Jewish plot.  I speculate that if Marx was not born as a Jew, Hitler would have communistic strategies into his economic plan.  The fact is, throughout the entire book, Hitler employs Marx's unique vocabulary.  The bottom line is this: Reading MEIN KAMPF immediately after it was published would offer no insight into the German plan for World War II or the Holocaust.  There is no plan laid out as many TV commenters contend.  In fact, MEIN KAMPF suggests that the first country to be invaded would be Russia - to free the people of Jewish Communism.<br /><br />3) The most astounding dimension of MEIN KAMPF is the propaganda devices and half-truths.  I am writing this during the summer of 2012 and have witnessed the articulation of the party planks of both Democrats and Republicans. Both seem to be students of MEIN KAMPF.  As someone who has rejected party affiliation, I get chills when I notice that American politicians are employing Hitler's strategies to win over the ignorant sector of the population.  As a sidebar, Hitler admired the social and legal strategies that American's employed to contain the African-American population.  In particular, he noted that if Germans followed the American example, Jews would have never been able to control mass media.<br /><br />MEIN KAMPF is a critically important book for people to read.  However, because of Hitler's masterful employment of rhetorical devices, I can see how he can pull those who are not well-read into becoming white supremacist.  I actually thought about requiring MEIN KAMPF for my freshmen, but there is too great a chance that they would fall into the same trap as Americas who are buying the absurd political propaganda during the summer of 2012.<br /><br />* There is no doubt that Hitler read and had a thorough understanding of Marx's DAS KAPITAL and Machiavelli's THE PRINCE.  In addition, he had an in-depth understanding of European and American history.hat they would fall into the same trap as Americas who are buying the absurd political propaganda during the summer of 2012.    * There is no doubt that Hitler read and had a thorough understanding of Marx's DAS KAPITAL and Machiavelli's THE PRINCE.

145162607X|5.0|The fourth book in Phillipa Gregory's The Cousins' Wars series, based on the War of the Roses between the Lancastrian and York lines, is told from the viewpoint of Anne Neville, daughter of Richard Neville.  Richard Neville, also known as the kingmaker since his military strategy and political know-how helps Edward IV overthrow his cousin Henry VI, will stop at nothing to see one of his daughters on the throne. Edward marries Elizabeth Woodville, a lower ranking noble with ambitions of her own, robbing Neville of the power he once had over the newly crowned king.  War is not far off and Neville will stop at nothing to get closer to the crown, killing the queen's kin without trials and marrying his daughters to possible over-throwers of King Edward.  Anne and her sister are tossed from winning to losing sides many times and readers will wonder what shall happen to Anne, unless of course they've read the other books in the series.<br /><br />Though Anne Neville hasn't the distinctive personality of Margaret Beaufort from Gregory's second book in the series, The Red Queen, Anne's story is a page-turner until the very end. The wild ride from one war to another, from one marriage to the next keeps the reader wanting more, desperate to discover what will happen next even though they know what eventually happens to Anne (if they've read the other books in the series).  Gregory brings the real history of the War of the Rose to life through Anne's complex relationship with key players in this real-life game of thrones.  For example, Margaret of Anjou who murdered Anne's grandfather and became the source of her childhood nightmares, eventually becomes a mentor of sorts to the young Anne.  It's amazing how Gregory can take a villain from one book and authentically paint her as the heroine of her own story.  The Kingmaker's Daughter is a must read for royal fiction fans and the best yet in The Cousins' War series. 5/5 Stars<br /><br />Author: Phillipa Gregory<br />Genre:  Adult Historical Fiction<br />Publication Date:  July 14, 2012<br />Source: Purchased by Reviewer<br />Review Written by Andrea Cefalo, author of The Fairytale Keeper series and chief editor of Obelisk ReviewHistorical Fiction<br />Publication Date:  July 14, 2012<br />Source: Purchased by Reviewer<br />Review Written by Andrea Cefalo, author of The Fairytale Keeper series and chief editor of Obelisk Review
0763619612|5.0|This is literally the only book in my 2 1/2 year old's sizable library that had ever moved me. I actually get choked up by the end. Does anyone else or is it just me? This is truly a book for all ages. It teaches creativity, confidence, kindness, and more. I'm not so sure that my toddler understands the full impact of the story (maybe she does) but she certainly enjoys it. While we're drawing she'll sometimes say to me \\"now sign it\\". She asks for it regularly (but not every day as she has a very large collection of books in addition to whatever we have from the library). I highly recommend this book even for toddlers but especially for slightly older kids and well...everybody else.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the app on my kindle fire. It is fast when it loads. It's way faster than just going on the web. I sometimes have problems opening the app. My screen stays white and then I have to force close it. I have to give it another couple of tries and then it opens. When it works, I love it. Now I probably pin too much because it is so fast.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|When we rented this movie we thought it would be as good as the original.  It turned out to be only an OK movie that was sometimes confusing and hard to follow.  Even the humor was many times difficult to understand.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Played on my kindle fire - no issues.  Graphics are awesome.  Lots of hidden object games and other interactive games.  2 play modes - normal & expert.  I played normal - need the hints once in a while.  I've played about 4-5 hours and I'm not done yet.  Get this game, you won't be disappointed.
0062086529|5.0|This book belongs in every kid's library. It's a magical journey that shows children of all ages the power of imagination. While the illustrations obviously take center stage I also really like the text. While it's simple enough for a toddler to understand I think the word choice and phraseology are such that it will help to expand vocabulary and reading skills. But the real reason for the 5 star review is becasue my 2 1/2 year old adores the book. She has nearly memorized it and now \\"reads\\" it to us every night! I don't know if your kid will love it as much as mine but I would highly recommend giving it a try. Also, it's not a painful read for the parents (fairly short, not too wordy, absence of annoying nonsense words, and lacks the mind numbing repetitiveness of some other children's books).
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Awesome movie. I love being able to watch movies on Amazon and the Batman trilogy is great. It is my first time watching the trilogy and look forward to watching them again.

B008OW1RWQ|2.0|Why MFSL opted for the stereo mix is a mystery. Great choice for those who want to listen to this LP with vocals in the center, the guitar way over in the right corner and the harmonica in the left. This isn't a remix either so there are still many instances of the voice whipping over from left to centre at the end of harmonica solos and vice versa. A quick comparison with the far cheaper Hybrid SACD released almost ten years ago shows that the MFSL disc has more compression applied - another example of the CD loudness war. The mono mix - now easily obtainable - is far superior and natural sounding and that was what Dylan and his engineers and producer had in mind when the LP was recorded, stereo mixes were a knocked-out loaded afterthought for 'hi-fi buffs' and would remain so for several more years. One listen to this and it's easy to hear why, best avoided.
0316056871|5.0|As I read Tina Fey's memoir, I sometimes could not help wondering if I was reading a memoir about Liz Lemon as written by Tina Fey or the other way around.  It made me laugh out loud, and you can enjoy reading about the life and escapades of Tina Fey even if you are unfamiliar with the show \\"30 Rock\\"  or, as I am, Saturday Night Live.  (Gasp-where have I been???  Oh, right...reading.)  Readers 16 and up will probably enjoy Bossypants most (especially if they already like Tina Fey) and be able to appreciate the humor, no matter whether you are male or female (I lent the book to my boyfriend and he really like it).
B008GFI4KY|5.0|\\"Permission to Land\\" was an instant classic. The follow-up album was a DUD. \\"Hot Cakes\\" falls just short of \\"Permission to Land\\"... It rocks hard from start to finish, but it lacks the edge (and the profanity.. except for track 1) of their first album. Also, while the solos are excellent, the solos on Permission tended to extend just a little bit past the point of satisfaction into the realm of bliss. As usual, there is humor (intended or unintended) throughout. I LOVE this album. The cover of \\"Street Spirit\\" is a highlight.
B006H3MIV8|1.0|It gave me a few laughs.  Some hysterically horrible covers on this set.  Come on people.  4 out of 5 star average for this crap (most)?  Oh well.  Even in No Direction Home.. in an interview with Bob himself.. he made it perfectly clear that he never did like people covering his tunes.

B008CJ8S0A|5.0|At 21, Trifonov \\"has the world at his feet,\\" as the Times of London pronounced, having won not just the Gold Medal at the 2011 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow but also the Grand Prix for the best competitor in any category. That honor was bestowed by Valery Grgiev in person, and here the two are paired in the well-worn Tchaikovsky Cto. no. 1. Immediately you hear an exceptional musician in Trifonov (beyond what I could find in his earliest recordings as a teen-ager), blessed with effortless ease and the kind of instinct that makes you listen to overly familiar music with real relish.<br /><br />Several things help the superlative result of this collaboration, the first being that Gergiev is among the most acclaimed Tchaikovsky conductors in the world, and the Mariinsky Orch. is totally in sympathy. The live recorded sound is deep alive, and more or less flawless - the whole album was recorded between Oct. 2011 and April, 2012. Noting is vulgar or brash; the bravura comes from seemingly real passion for the score. Although he only earned the bronze medal at the last International Chopin Competition (inciting a certain \\"he was robbed\\" mood), Trifonov specializes in Chopin, and he applies that kind of mercurial delicacy to the slow movement. I'm happy to report that Gergiev imparts real energy and pace to this movement, saving it from being overly refined. The finale is taken at a clip, setting the stage for the kind of dazzling intensity that Horowitz and Argerich have displayed in their famous recordings. But Gergiev and Trifonov take care to find musicality beyond virtuoso fire-breathing, with a surprising slow up in several sections. Overall, this is the most charismatic reading I've heard in years and belongs with the versions from two other young Turks(at the time), Ivo Pogorelich and Denis Matsuev.<br /><br />It's curious to split the program between the concerto and a sizable selection of Liszt transcriptions of Schubert and Schumann lieder, along with the Chopin Barcarolle and a small Tchaikovsky solo work, Un poco di Chopin. But who can argue with hearing Trifonov in solo recital after what he does in the concerto? I remember being won over by the young Kissin in these works, especially the transcriptions of ERlkonig and Widmumg.  If anything, Tifonov is better - whimsical, unpredictable, making us hear a singer at the same time as Liszt's finger-crunching decorations fly past. In all, a triumph.opin Barcarolle and a small Tchaikovsky solo work, Un poco di Chopin. But who can argue with hearing Trifonov in solo recital after what he does in the concerto?

0345529057|5.0|I am not ashamed to admit that it takes me about 2 to 3 weeks to read each book in this epic fantasy series, because each tome is really heavy (literally and story-wise) and clock in at around 800 pages (on average)!  And George R. R. Martin has not even finished writing them. These books are excellent, and you do not have to like fantasy in order to enjoy reading them.  However, they are strictly for the 16-17 and up audience, and even then I would tread cautiously; just because I myself have been reading the books since I was 16 does not mean that everyone can or should.  These stories have everything in it, and by that I mean everything.  There are many themes and situations that may be disturbing to some readers.  The series is basically about a country on the edge of war; a usurper king has an unstable rule over the seven lands of Westeros, and plots and intrigues are rife throughout the kingdom and across the sea in the Eastern lands.  Triggering events pit people against each other even as new bonds are forged and old ones are renewed.  The story is told by various different characters, and the relationships among the different families and the histories of this world are vast and complex.  At a certain point, the reader just has to \\"go with it\\" and keep the books near at hand in order to refer to them about previous events.  Great storytelling and complex characters make for an engrossing, thrilling read!
014050639X|5.0|A great way to introduce nursery rhymes to children . Nursery rhymes are  forgotten and not introduced to children as in past years. An early I-Spy book that is very appropriate for early childhood education. I love this book.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I really, really love this box set.  The packaging is simple, yet elegant.  I love the book and the little other special things.  Like how Blonde On Blonde is on 2 discs as it were having 2 vinyl albums.  Nice touch, Columbia/Sony!  I have heard everything here on stereo format before this, so unfortunately, for me, some of the later work on this set takes a bit of getting used to. But once settled in.. I like it even better.  I like the fact that it's just a different format.. period.  So many timeless songs in this collection.  It's a pity I don't have the time to list them all, but the whole thing is magnificent, so why bother?  I'm a proud owner of this little box set.  And I do believe it's my favorite box set that I own.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\"  is a dark retelling of the famous fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that emphasizes toxic jealousy, the usurping of royal power, premeditated homicide, and the power of evil magic.<br /><br />Ravenna (Charlize Theron), an incredibly vain sorceress, has the ability to shape-shift, use her feminine wiles to enchant, and methodically seize absolute power.  Her prized possession is a round metallic mirror that assures her periodically that she is the fairest in the land.<br /><br />After Ravenna has successfully disposed of her husband, the king and father of young Snow White, the queen imprisons the child and rules with malevolence. Years later, when her mirror delivers the news that Snow White (Kristen Stewart) will soon surpass her as the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, the queen plots her death. But Show White escapes into the Dark Forest, a place where the queen's magic doesn't work. Ravenna summons a drunk, rough-hewn huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), and orders him to find the young woman and kill her.<br /><br />Ms. Theron acts up a storm here with a characterization that allows her plenty of opportunity to play her scenes to the max.  She makes a fearsomely wicked queen and, with the assistance of special effects, is a formidable adversary against Snow White.<br /><br />Hemsworth (Thor in \\"The Avengers\\") once again carries a weapon, this time an ax, as the unwilling killer.  He is a big guy with a deep voice who looks and sounds the part of an uneducated clod. He rises to a state of heroism when he realizes what Snow White is up against and transforms from would-be assassin to protector.<br /><br />Ms. Stewart (the \\"Twilight\\" saga) is the weak link in the cast. The script attempts to make Snow White more than a shuddering, defenseless naif, but Ms. Stewart appears to be phoning in her performance. There's little fire, and we never are convinced that she is in fear for her life.<br /><br />Director Rupert Sanders has crafted a smart-looking movie, with special effects worked smoothly into the narrative rather than overshadowing it.  There are phantom armies, characters morphing into others, and normal-sized actors -- Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, and Ian McShane -- digitally shrunk to portray the dwarfs who become Show White's allies.<br /><br />The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains numerous bonus extras, including audio commentary by director and key crew members; behind-the-scenes footage; a video tour of the Pinewood Studio's sets on which the movie was shot; and four featurettes covering visual effects, characterizations, fairy tale elements, and \\"Tone Poem,\\" a proof-of-concept reel that sold the studio on the project.  The movie is also available as a single-disc DVD

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one clever, twisty story that'll keep you guessing and then surprise you.  If I were to review this book based on the first 75% or so, I'd give it 5 stars, no question.  Up to the last quarter or so, it was the best book I'd read in years, a perfect combination of literary novel and thrilling page-turner.  Unfortunately, it loses steam toward the end, becoming a bit silly in my opinion from the point where Amy decides not to do herself in.

B004YM6JP0|3.0|\\"The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Third Season,\\" available as a Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack, contains all 22 episodes of Season Three in addition to never-before-seen extras.  Based on the best-selling book series, \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is the tale of two vampire brothers -- Stefan and Damon Salvatore -- obsessed with the same beautiful girl -- Elena Gilbert -- who are battling to control the fate of an entire town.  In the second season, the appearance of the vengeful Katherine Pierce upset the love triangle among Stefan, Elena, and Damon, and the other residents of Mystic Falls were forced to choose sides as they fell victim to a new form of danger.<br /><br />Stefan and Damon later encounter their greatest challenge yet -- the arrivals of Elijah and Klaus, two of the original vampires.  Season Three provides more of Klaus' back story and the original family as his motives for wanting Stefan on his side are finally revealed.  As Stefan sinks more deeply into the dark side, Damon and Elena struggle with the guilt of their growing bond, even as the work together to bring Stefan back from the edge.<br /><br />Bonus extras on this 9-disc set include two featurettes, deleted scenes, gag reel, favorite scenes, and \\"The Producer's Pages,\\" a look at elements contributing to the series' atmosphere.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|This game is slow moving.  My son is faster because he knows Legos. He is a great builder, and his \\"creations\\" actually look like the item on the card.  The game moves slowly while you are waiting for a player to pick his/her pieces, figure out a way to build the item, and then to actually build it.<br /><br />It could be made more fun if it came with more of a variety of pieces that were more versatile, (like a piece that would work to make a rhinoceros as well as a computer).  Another suggestion is that it gives a few hints on which pieces to use to build the item, and possibly even some simple instructions.<br /><br />My son loves it, however.  He only likes to play it with one other person for the above mentioned reasons.

B008KEQMDC|2.0|\\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\"  takes its title from a popular manual, consulted by millions of soon-to-be parents, that covers every facet of the pregnancy process. The ensemble piece follows the adventures of several couples about to have a baby.<br /><br />TV fitness guru Jules (Cameron Diaz) and dance-show star Evan (Matthew Morrison) find that their fast-paced celebrity lives don't stand a chance against the surprise demands of pregnancy.  Baby-crazy author and advocate Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) gets a taste of her own militant-mom advice when pregnancy hormones ravage her body, while her husband, Gary ( Ben Falcone), struggles not to be outdone by his competitive alpha-Dad (Dennis Quaid), who is expecting twins with his much younger trophy wife, Skyler (Brooklyn Decker).<br /><br />Photographer Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is prepared to travel the globe to adopt a child, but her husband, Alex (Rodrigo Santoro), isn't so sure, and tries to ease his panic by attending a \\"dudes\\" support group, where new fathers get to tell it like it really is.  And rival food truck chefs Rosie (Anna Kendrtick) and Marco's (Chance Crawford) surprise hook-up results in an unexpected quandary.<br /><br />Though each of the characters has a good scene of two, there are far too many charascters to contend with.  The movie seems overstuffed and we only get brief glimpses of each couple with little in the way of depth or back story.  The film is pleasant enough and the actors nice to look at, but this romantic comedy falls into the realm of predictable syrupiness.  This is strictly tepid TV sitcom caliber.<br /><br />Extras on this release, available on both Blu-ray and DVD, include two featurettes and deleted scenes.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really did not see what the hype was while reading this book. I heard so many people saying how amazing it was, and it had been on my \\"to read\\" list for a long time, so when my friend gave it to me to read I was excited...It took me a long time to finish it. I just couldn't get into it. It did get a little better at the end, so I started the next book, \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\" I must say that I am enjoying it more than the first.
0307744434|3.0|Did not love this book. I just don't think the characters were well developed and I never felt like I really knew any of them or was rooting for any of them. I have been told that men like this book more than women but I think it did NOT live up to the hype.

B0061PEAUY|5.0|This installment of Temperance Brennan is very fasinating not only because of the crime but also of history of Canada. I enjoyed all the characters old and new in this book, plus the enviromental issues that were explored as part of the story line. The book moved at a good pace and was a very enjoyable read. I already looking forward to the next adventure that \\"Bones\\" will have.
B005S9EJ46|3.0|\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\"  is a joy for those who love veteran thespians who can act up a storm.  A group of English retirees decide to relocate to a seniors hotel in Darpur, India, to live a relaxing life of leisure.  Unfortunately, the hotel turns out to be a dive -- rundown, dreary, and depressing.<br /><br />The characters are a lot more colorful and interesting than the plot.  Tom Wilkinson plays gay magistrate Graham Dashwood, who has returned to India to find the boy he loved and left when he was young.  Bill Nighy is retired bureaucrat Douglas Ainslie with an irritating, constantly complaining wife (Penelope Wilton), whose savings have been lost by a daughter's careless investment.  Judi Dench is recent widow Evelyn Greenslade, who has never before looked after herself.  Maggie Smith is Muriel Donnelly, an unapologetic racist in need of a hip replacement.  And Celia Imrie is Madge Hardcastle, a gold digger still very much on the prowl.<br /><br />The film attempts to tell too many stories simultaneously, which gives it an overstuffed feel.  But it's unusual to have a movie these days reliant on Golden Agers, and it's a pleasure watching these superb actors sinking their teeth into sometimes underwritten characters and enlivening them with years of experience.<br /><br />Once the principal characters are assembled and disappointed by what they find, director John Madden provides their back stories.  There are many cliches and maybe too neat an ending, but the performances more than make up for the script's shortcomings.  Personally speaking, I would be happy to watch Maggie Smith peel an apple.  She is, at this point in her carrer, legendary and a master at her craft.<br /><br />Available on both DVD and Blu-ray, \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\"  bonus extras consist of only behind-the-scenes footage and some location interviews.

B000FC146C|5.0|Thanks to a recent Harper Collins price reduction I have bought a copy of The Thorn Birds for my Kindle Classics bookshelf. I read it when it was released in the late 1970's and was impressed with the quality of McCullough's work and her outstanding prose. I am an Aussie and she described the local background and characters so accurately and passionately. The story is a description of the attitudes at that time to relationships and to the Catholic Church - some have changed and others haven't. I look forward to reading it again.<br /><br />It is now part of my small collection of outstanding books that are now on my modern classics Kindle bookshelf.  It will join Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts, The Winds of War by Herman Wouk, God is an Englishman by R F Delderfield, Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth and a few others. This week I added the full WWI memoirs by Winston Churchill when they were $1.99 each as Kindle Daily Deals (what a bargain for an outstanding and detailed and brilliantly written personal account of WWII from Churchill's perspective). Some day soon I will add a couple of Micheners but I am waiting for Centennial to be released on Kindle.<br /><br />As a postscript let me say that I will not be viewing the mini-series again which starred Richard Chamberlain, Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown. While the acting was OK, as an Aussie I was appalled that it was filmed in California (in Lone Ranger country which doesn't look anything like the outback) and in Kawaii. I can still recall how I was stunned that the producers did not bother to use right hand drive cars.

B008BM9L72|2.0|Read all three books and cannot understand why they sold so many copies. They are badly written, repetitious,(if I read variations of the word \\"smirk\\" once more I swear I was going to throw up)and the sex scenes were frankly boring. Bring back Forever Amber  Fanny Hill or any of the Emmanuelle series. Sex is fun...... not painful, subordinate and controlled by damaged young men as depicted here.

I am an avid reader and don't remember when I have read something so unbelievable and trashy.
B004CLYKLI|1.0|I hated this book. I want my money back. What I most disliked was the abuse the author's daughters went through. Somebody should have reported this to abuse while it was going on! This woman was a control FREAK, & that is a personality issue not a cultural one.
0345803493|3.0|I just did not think after all 3 books that it is worth the hype it is getting. ?I cannot believe that Ana and Christian can live in a total sex world,but then again no one really has to work like we all do!I expected more of a plot with all the characters involved. Jack Hyde was a distraction, The characters of Kate and Elliot really had no solid purpose and Mia and Ethan was dumb. There was nothing in the book but s/m sex etc and I guess if you are bored with your life this may enhance it, but I cannot see a red room of pain in my house.

You don't need to have any background knowledge to read her stories; she fills it in for you without ever feeling like you are being lectured to.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|While not the normal Reacher book I still enjoyed it and will forever enjoy them as they come out.  As long as I realized the book wasn't set in the car the whole time I was good and it got better after that anyhow.  Who cares if he threatened a kid, if you are the parent to say you are going to do something to your kids you are threatening them as well.  Stop being hippies.  As far as Tom Cruise playing Reacher, what the hell does that have to do with anything involving this book.  I have noticed many movie reviews are on this book's page and they shouldn't be.  Very stupid to put this book down negatively just because you don't like an actor portraying Reacher.  What is wrong with people.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|First off let me just say that I do like this movie. In fact i remember where & when I saw it while in the movie theatre, Now if your of a certain age then you have this this memory as well.  When Logan's Run first came out in 1976 it was state of the art. and through the years that when I'd see it on cable or the SciFi channel it still looked good as well. But here now that is is 2012 and close to its 40 anniversary, Logan's Run is starting to show its age badly.  When I was originally looking for a copy of this DVD i was shocked to find out that 3 different versions of it are still available. The edition you see here before you is the latest one and its the one I recommend that you pick up as well because it has the latest in film and sound quality. If you do have the choice and most times you don\\"t, always go with the latest, most recent edition possible. So my quibbling isn't with the either the film or sound quality as both are top notch its the fact there's been a lot of progress in film special effects the past 30 years or so and unfortunately because of that this film is acquiring a \\"dated\\" look about it. The music & sound effects are especially amaturish when viewed in today's CGI computer graphics glasses. If you can look at this movie with all the wonder and wide eyed enthusiasm that you had all those years ago then you wont be disappointed. But if you've been watching a steady diet of the latest & greatest Sci Fi movies recently your forgiveness and tolerance for such things will be tested. This is one movie that I would love to see be remade using today's technology<br />FYI: And it looks like this may happen sooner rather then later. According to the website Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB), actors Ryan Gossling & Rose Bryne have been linked to this movie remake project. I just hope this new version is faithful to the original. Logan's Run is definitely a movie that deserves to be remade the right way using all the latest & greatest special effects available. After all the first one was made with this in mind and this one should be approached the same way as well. Enjoy!

B004T4LUPW|5.0|The best calendar and task organizer that syncs with Google.  I use it everyday and it works great.  Also, the developer is always improving and adding new features.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but this has become my new favorite game. I've been playing it on and off for a few weeks, and it hasn't gotten boring. Definitely worth the download.
B000U7XUKK|5.0|I first purchased this album as an adolescent. It has shaped me into the person I am now. Ryan Mitrovich has described the album most aptly, \\"At the heart of Funeral is the fierce declaration that love will always conquer the finality of death. Arcade Fire tackle this huge theme with nothing left to lose, creating a timeless triumph of the human spirit that empowers with every listen\\".
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely read science fiction, I like mysteries, but how could I ignore so many 5-star reviews.  Bought it and loved it.  Couldn't put it down, but of course, I had to.  I have a life.  Very enjoyable book.  I will be reading #6 and trying other books by this author. I highly recomend this book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love pinterest but they really need to fix the kindle app. Constantly having to close and restart...Also forces closed and locks up!!Please Fix!!!!
B007ZJDGXC|5.0|I loved it.  The entire movie was action packed. Stayed on the edge of my seat.  Was not expecting Denzel to die in the end.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|Love this movie! Kevin Costner is AWESOME in this movie! A great family movie and Kevin Costner....a great actor as always. I would highly recommend this movie. I'm glad it finally came out on DVD.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Put this in my first build. Keeps my processor under 37C when overclocked. Some reviews (maybe on here, maybe on newegg) said the installation was difficult. The installation instructions are terrible, but I figured it out from common sense.<br /><br />I recommend highly.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|sgt peppers lonely hearts club band album is fantastic as I have always wanted to own it and I love all the songs that are on the album especially hey jude and when I am 64 and octopuses garden and many more of the songs that are well known that are there.I love the beatles and have grown up with them all my life and I recommend this album to anyone who is a beatles fan is a must have album.<br />  Michael Pritchard

B002SRQ214|5.0|Put this in my first build. Nice speed, takes very well to overclocking.<br />Only Con: It's a bit loud...and by a bit, I mean quite loud.<br />Other than that, i'd highly recommend it.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|Good price. Good movie. Gonna miss the arnie action movies. There all classics. A few bummers but it's terminator. Can't get more badass
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I really liked this movie and so did my best friend (who is 37 weeks pregnant!)  I loved how they really portrayed the labor scenes!  I get so tired of seeing movies with women going into labor and looking so great...when in real life you look like...well the way Cameron Diaz looked in this movie!!  They all did a great job.  The only thing I didn't like was Rosie and Marco.  Their characters seemed kind of pointless and kind of just thrown in there (also their acting wasn't the greatest either). This movie was so funny and heartwarming...but Rosie and Marco's story didn't seem to fit.  But overall...GREAT MOVIE!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|love, love, love this!! would recommend to everyone out there who like Adele's type of music. Buy yours today at Amazon, it's really hard coming up with 20 words for review....
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was a senior in high school when the album \\"Sea Change\\" came out. I bought it shortly after I was in a car accident that really shook me up. I used to listen to it all the time in my old car, driving around town listening to songs like \\"Lost Cause,\\" \\"Around the Bend,\\" and everything else. Ten years later, I dusted off the CD and listened to it again, and it still has the same power. Melancholic, tender melodies, with soulful lyrics, a 21st century mixture of blues and folk. It's just great. One of the ABSOLUTE best albums of the 00s. Rolling Stone Magazine agrees with me!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I HAVE HAD THESE 4 about 6months they have been giving me problems for 3month. wire shorted out r something one ear doesn't word.... TRASH!!!  when i bought these they cost me $73.00 sound quality not very good bad for gaming
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty kool if you are a fan of the sims series. Has me siting here trying to build my city.
B0053O89KG|1.0|I have loved Castle since season one and have followed it faithfully since the very first episode. However, season four was a complete let down. The show didn't seem to be about solving crime with some added humor as it was in the first few seasons; now the show only seemed to revolve around Castle and Beckets unspoken attraction for one another. Don't get me wrong I like romance as much as the next girl but this was much too serious and dragged out for what is supposed to be a lighthearted mystery show! The only mystery the team even attempts to solve throughout this season is somehow always connected to Kate's mother's murder. (No offence now, but they either need to put her mother's murder on the back burner for a while or just solve it and move on!) The jokes that usually fill a Castle episode and make my Monday nights something I actually look forward too, were far and few between, and the warm humor usually brought from Castle's mother and daughter were also replaced by more drama! I'm hoping the next season will be better and return to what the show is really about and get rid of the unwanted drama. With the exception on one MAYBE two episodes, this season was a complete dud.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I purchased this album shorty after listening to \\"We are Young\\". I was not expecting an album worthy of five stars but rather one were i liked 3 or 4 songs from it. Oh man was I wrong!<br />My boyfriend had told me that this was not the first cd for the band so i jumped into the conclusion that they were not as good as they are because I had never heard from them before the hit \\"We are Young\\".<br />F.U.N is a solid band and their album \\"Some Nights\\" is a must have album if you like good music.<br /><br />1. Some Nights (Intro) - When i first heard it I could not help but to think of Queen. Interesting Intro. 8/10<br /><br />2. Some Nights- Very nice song! Great choice of second single. 9.5/10<br /><br />3. We are Young ( feat. Janelle Monae) - Who doesn't love this one seriously? best song on the album. 10/10<br /><br />4. Carry on- I like this song, makes the opening of the Cd quite strong. 9/10<br /><br />5. It Gets better - Pumps you up, very good but not the best. 8/10<br /><br />6. Why am I the one - Reading some reviews i noticed that it wasn't liked much. I must say that this is my second favorite song from the album! I cant help but to play it over and over when I'm driving in the car. 10/10<br /><br />7. All alone - Catchy! 10/10<br /><br />8. All alright- If you like the previous songs, you will like this one. 9/10<br /><br />9. One foot - Good tunes. 8/10<br /><br />10. Stars- This song is good in its own way. Not my favorite but not bad. I skip this one. 7/10<br /><br />11. Out on the Town (Bonus track) - Good way to finish off an album of this magnitude . 10/10<br /><br />You will find yourself listening to this record over and over again while liking it more each time around.
1416583432|5.0|I enjoyed this wonderful insight into dogs....it really is amazing how they have evolved and what they can do. The author roamed a bit into other creatures also which I thought was interesting.  I have given copies to other dog lovers as gifts.

B00932A2MC|3.0|the best thing about this film were the explosions and the alien toys. I believe there were some actors. in short it should only have been released as a rental, marketed as something to do if your bored.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|First pack most of the batteries were dead, tested them in multiple Dells and Lenovos--all reported voltage errors.  Reported that to the seller, he shipped another set for free and those are all good.  Worked out in the end and quite and bit cheaper than anything available locally.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Of the three books, my opinion is should have been only one book.  The third of the trilogy is predictable and as the other two, to much of the \\"f\\" word.  Could have been more of a best seller if weren't for that.
B0063GORYU|5.0|wasn't sure just how this game went until i really got into it.  what a great game..<br />for the first time I can say I love a spider....hahah
B008MM9630|5.0|I enjoy finding &amp; growing things. And how I learn how to get pets &amp; freinds. I want to know more about this game. Are there any surprises in this game.
B002Z8LPZ4|4.0|I have been a fan of Kate Beckinsale ever since \\"Uncovered\\" back in the early 1990s.  She is versatile.  And ever since \\"Underworld\\", she has widened her range to join the short list of female action stars in Hollywood.  Now, this movie should have done better at the Box Office.  It is a very good movie, with commendable performances from Ms. Beckinsale and Mr. Skeritt (Tom Skeritt).  If you have room in your DVD shelf, this would be a good one to add.<br /><br />The setting is unusual.  Antarctica!  Yes, everything is all white.  Just watching is enough to make you shiver in your pajamas.  The main character is Carrie Stetko (Beckinsale), a female U.S. Marshall charged with maintaining the peace in a remote multinational research station in Antarctica.  Every year, the station has to be evacuated due to a weather phenomenon known as the \\"Whiteout\\" which make survival nearly impossible in that part of the continent.  As the station prepares for evacuation, a dead body is discovered.  Stetko and the station's chief medical officer, Tom Skeritt, examines the body. They find evidence of foul play.  With just a few days remaining before the evacuation and a killer on the loose, Stetko is under time constraints to solve the murder.<br /><br />I must say that Kate Beckinsale deserves to have more starring roles.  I think she has played the role of supporting lady to a leading man like Mark Wahlberg enough times.  Hopefully, she will get more chances to play truly well-written lead characters in future action movies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is an easy read that keeps you emotionally invested the entire time. Charlie is an old soul that helps put life into perspective for the reader, no matter how great or tough the times are for him. To be honest, I read the book on the recommendation of a friend, and because the movie trailer intrigued me. Now I just hope the movie up to the book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|gentle music plays while you figure out level upon level of tile designs. they even reward you with prizes when you complete puzzles in record time. even the option to constantly change your backgrounds behind the tiles adds to the enjoyment! For those who love solitaire..this is the ultimate next level of solo play!
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I WANTED THIS MOVIE TO WATCH ON MY BLUE RAY PLAYER, IT WAS A GREAT BUY, IT CAME IN LIKE THREE DAYS THE PRICE WAS GREAT, THANKS
0553801473|5.0|Brilliant!  A tour-de-force of story-telling in the fantasy genre!<br /><br />Daenerys Targaryen, the silver-haired dragon princess, finds herself ruling the savage lands known as \\"Slaver's Bay\\".  Jon Snow, the bastard Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, unwittingly creates discension among the ranks of the ancient brotherhood.  And the kinslayer Tyrion Lannister, on the run from bounty hunters, makes his way across Essos, hoping to find and to serve the Targaryen princess.  Through the trials and the hardships of these three main characters, the story unfolds.  And what a story it is!  Plots are resolved, while new ones develop.  Characters die, new ones are introduced.  Chaos and unrest are on the rise in both East and West.  Slaves dream of freedom.  Magical abilities increase.  The three dragons (Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion) continue to grow stronger, and wilder.  The supernatural threat from the far North makes itself more prominent as the long winter approaches.  And the freedom-loving savages known as the Wildlings have come down from the far North to settle below the Wall.  While the eunuch, Varys, continues to create his own brand of disorder within the capital city, King's Landing.  Cersei, daughter of the great house of Lannister, continue in her inept rulership of the Seven Kingdoms.  Meanwhile, players big and small continue to play the game of thrones.<br /><br />As in the previous volumes, the story is told through character point of views.  While this gives you intimacy with those particular characters, non-major characters tend to remain an enigma. Not every reader will appreciate this type of narrative, I'm afraid.  But if you can deal with it, I think you are in for a long love affair with A Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />I don't think this humble reviewer will need to work very hard to sell you on this book.  The previous volumes and the new HBO television series speak for the novel.  It goes without saying that anyone wishing to read this novel should only do so after reading the previous four that preceded it.  If you are already a reader and would like to join a community of others to share your thoughts, theories, and ideas with, be assured that there are plenty of online communities out there dedicated to the series.  Towerofthehand.com is one of the more popular sites, along with Westeros.org.ovel should only do so after reading the previous four that preceded it.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game. it is a fun game somewhat like connect the dots. it can be easy or challenging. you can change the difficulty. this game is awesome and engaging.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|I was able to snag this for my son's 9th birthday coming up.  He is a HUGE Minecraft fan...Legos too!  I can't wait for him to open it!!!
B002SRQ214|5.0|This got to my door in 4 days with 5-7 day shipping here in Hawaii.  Another suprise was that I recieved a black edition processor!  The multiplier is unlocked for overclocking, a feature I wanted, but what I didn't want was to spend an extra $40 on it.  3.4 GHz is enough for $90.  Now I've managed to get this thing up to a stable 4GHz with the Hyper 212 Plus cooler.  The stock heatsink isn't too bad either.  It has four heatpipes and a large copper baseplate, something even my Hyper 212+ didn't have.  The fins are also directly attached to the baseplate, giving even better heat transfer.  The small fan is a little louder than the 120mm 212+ fan, but you don't have to worry about it getting too out of control if you have a good case like the HAF 912.
B0088TG252|4.0|Another great performance by Denzel and a surprisingly great performance by Ryan, overall very suspenseful and action pack edge of your seat thriller......
B0086700CM|4.0|I am so happy it has finally come out! I cant wait to play on it. I have played it before at an aneroid store and it was awesome! Yay!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent and captured your interest as did book one and two.  Glad I read the series and would recommend to other readers.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Admittedly, though I could appreciate it for what it was, I was never a huge fan of Star Trek in any of it's incarnations. However, I like JJ Abrams, the cast was great and I thought, why not check it out? I knew enough about the show to appreciate the subtleties they put in, while at the same time being able to enjoy it as a brand new fan. I loved their take on it and I think it's the perfect place for anyone who loves sci-fi, but doesn't know much about the show to get started. It was incredibly entertaining and you're doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out.
B000067CPX|5.0|Just my opion but no other albums have such beautiful vocals, which is what this album is about. I grew up on this album, 2nd grade was this album, a classic and i would reocmend it to anybody!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it. it is totally addictive and fun. I is also secretly educational teaching you strategy and patience. And it is freeeereeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|First, the theatrical release. Then, the extended director's cut. Now, the 3D theatrical release. PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS THE SHORTER VERSION. Be prepared to but it again or wait for the 3D extended director's cut. The, of course, will be followed by the Ultimate 3D Ultraviolet deluxe edition with Smellovision, which makes sense, because these quadruple dipping tactics really stink.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I'm not trying to take anything away from this movie. It is really great. But for some reason, I just couldn't get as into it as I did the first two. I think the addition of so many new characters made it harder to connect to them? I don't know. But this movie still looks amazing on blu ray and I think you can't avoid owning this if you have the other two.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I find that I really like fantasy and science fiction books that are somewhat grounded in reality -- like the stories could carry themselves without the supernatural / magical elements. This book is very cohesive, solidly written and very engaging. Great character development - I'm actually interested in what happens to our hero, Kvothe.<br /><br />I wasn't able to put the book down and am now devouring the second book!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|While I like Rush a lot and have just about everything they've done, I kind of get embarrassed by some of the reviews that are written. They border on the irrationally fanatical. Rush is a rock band, not some divine force through which the words of divine beings are transmitted.<br /><br />Having said that, they are one hell of a rock band, and this album proves it. These guys are pushing sixty and have more musical imagination, energy and technical skill than all but a handful of the rock greats throughout time. Each member is a virtuoso on his instrument (we're defining Geddy Lee's instrument as the bass, of course, not the keys, although he's no slouch on those either). I never really liked his voice as much when it was shrill and shrieking, but now it's come down a bit with the ages he sounds really, really good. Lyrically...well, we know that Neil Peart is an articulate man. His lyrics are always thoughtful and worth listening hard to. He is a good lyricist, but he is a great drummer. His drums should be the focus of your attention. And Alex Lifeson does something that most guitarists can't - he plays with skill, fire and soul, while at no time trying to draw attention to himself as \\"the guitarist\\". He plays for the song, every time. The other guys do too, of course, but given that how most people focus more on guitar than on bass or drums, it takes a lot of maturity to play the way Lifeson does. It is rare to hear a Rush song and say \\"wow, listen to that guitar\\"; rather one says \\"wow, listen to this song\\". That's what happens when 3 masters keep their egos in check and play together.<br /><br />Pertaining to this album in particular, I have to go with \\"The wreckers\\" as a standout. Melodically great, a marvelous chorus and an interesting set of lyrics. \\"Headlong Flight\\" is an example of how they can still pump out some serious energy, and (as others have said) this song in particular sounds like a nod to the early albums. The last track, \\"The Garden\\", is musically very pretty, but I don't feel that it's the revelatory masterpiece that some do. It's good because it's different; it's not a typical Rush song and because of that it catches the attention.<br /><br />As has been said, though, this is an album first and foremost and demands to be listened to as such. While everyone will have his or her personal favourite tracks, Rush designed this to be taken in as a whole. Deeply unfashionable, when you consider that anyone who can concentrate for more than 3 minutes these days is akin to a Zen master, but Rush have never been a band to follow mainstream thinking. The result is this simply excellent album, and for that we can be appreciative.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Jiro Ono is a man in his 80s who is a sushi chef- possibly the best sushi chef in the world. Guide Michelin has awarded him three stars- the only sushi restaurant so honored. He has been making sushi since he was 9 years old, and believes there is still much for him to learn about making sushi. He practices his trade in a small, unassuming sushi bar in Tokyo where they serve no drinks, no appetizers- nothing but sushi. To eat there requires making a reservation a month in advance, and the willingness to spend 30,000 Yen- around $384- at a minimum on one meal. There is no menu at Jiro Ono's restaurant. What you are served depends entirely on the fish available that day, or that week, and Jiro's own tastes. There are no Dragon Rolls or other fancy compositions in Jiro's restaurant- just the simplest, most classic preparations. Most of it is Nigiri-sushi, a piece of hand formed rice with an exquisitely prepared piece of seafood placed on top, lightly seasoned with wasabi and soy.<br /><br />Jiro's life, and that of his sons, revolves around sushi, but the sushi is not the focus of this movie. Rather, it's about one man's absolute and utter devotion to his craft, to the extent that it has dictated every minute of his life, and to a great extent the lives of his sons, whom he either guided or drafted into the the sushi maker's trade, depending on how you look at it. And yet, for all his single-minded devotion to sushi, Jiro Ono appears to be a happy man who continues to take great enjoyment from every piece of sushi he composes. This film explores his life, his history, his family, and mostly, his dreams of sushi.
B0036EH3X4|3.0|SOME SPOILERS AHEAD: Lets face it. They screwed the pooch on Season 6. They spent 5 seasons building up to something spectacular and instead we get a season full of reality hopping blandness. The series finale barely made up for the rest of the season and I'm being generous there. Buy this if you own the other 5 seasons and you feel a need to have the whole collection. Otherwise, you can skip it and just ask a friend how it ends.
1451627289|4.0|I've always been a fan of time travel, and this book definitely has that component, but it's limited to only going back to one particular day in one particular location in the past, and then anything from there, the characters have to 'live' in the past time to move around and do anything. The characters come back to the 'present' and everything changes based on what they did while they were in the past. But when they go back again, it resets and everything they did the time before is now gone.<br /><br />So a local businessman, a small ma & pop type hamburger joint owner, uses the time travel portal he finds sort of as a vacation, a chance to go away and go fishing or visiting in the past, then come home and be back just two minutes after he took off.<br /><br />It works great until he decides he wants to change history by going back and stopping Kennedy's assassination. Unfortunately, he can't (spoilers so I'm being careful) finish his quest to do this, so he shares his secret with a high school teacher friend/regular customer at his diner. The teacher goes back in time, presumably to do the same thing: save Kennedy.<br /><br />To do that, he has to follow around Kennedy's presumed assisinator, Lee Harvey Oswald. AS a reader, we learn a lot about this man, more than I probably ever wanted to know, quite frankly. I guess that's where the book goes a bit off track for me. I get bored reading about Oswald and his comings and goings. I don't know if King did this to try to make sure we knew he had fully researched this guy and made it really realistic, but for me, it was mostly extraneous, really unnecessary for the furthering of the plot.<br /><br />I mean, this was a loooong book, and it wouldn't have hurt to have it a bit shorter by taking out a bunch of stuff that I found myself skipping over trying to get back to the plot itself.<br /><br />But once it got past all the day-to-day living and comings and goings of Oswald, I really enjoyed the story. There was some suspense, some intrigue, some crime, some romance, a touch of horror. If you've read [[ASIN:0451169514 It]], you'll enjoy some of the references to Derry in this book, as the main character visits Derry to complete his first task in the past. It's really neat to see how King weaved those elements in there. There were some other clever weave-ins of other books too, which would make a King fan enjoy figuring out which he referenced.<br /><br />I would venture to guess most King fans would find this book good, but not his usual type or style of work. This isn't horror, and it's not really his usual style. I enjoyed it, perhaps, even more, because it's not his usual style.<br /><br />So it gets four stars, because of the boring Oswald descriptive of day-to-day things that didn't further the plot, being excessively long for the necessity of telling the story (don't mind long stories if they need it, but this one didn't need to be THIS long), and for some descriptive that was extraneous.<br /><br />Other than that, the book had a lot of everything I like and I really enjoyed the main character. Definitely a book worth picking up. I'm glad I did.suspense, some intrigue, some crime, some romance, a touch of horror.

B005IZLPME|3.0|This is a very good movie. Interesting plot. Good acting. Excellent cinematography. My biggest complaint is: I bought this movie for the 3D effect. That, unfortunately, was a major letdown. The movie appears to be a 2D converted to 3D (as opposed to being originally recorded in 3D). If you have seen any of the IMAX 3D movies and use it as a standard, then this movie comes up way short of standard.<br /><br />Don't waste your money paying extra for the 3D feature. If you like this movie, just get the regular Blu-ray version.

B001992NUQ|5.0|I'll never understand why this movie did so poorly in theaters. However, I'm thankful it found new life in the retail section. I've owned this movie in ever special edition format released. There is so much going on in this movie. Commentary on society, dark humor, solid action, great acting, incredible camera work. Really, top to bottom, this is one of the best movies ever. If you haven't seen it, buy this and fix that problem. If you have and for some reason, don't own it, please see my previous remark. And screw the rules. Talk about Fight Club!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I liked the audio feature. In addition to the NIV, I wish there was an Oxford Annotated version, which I think is a more accurate translation.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put it down, even thru my tears! So glad I met Hazel and Gus!  A wonderful read!  Enjoy
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game.  Keeps me distracted from reality way too much.  Better than most of the other versions that I have tried.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Okay, so you're looking at my title for this review and you're probably thinking I'm a bit crazy. Well, maybe so. However, there is no doubt in my mind this movie is something special. It is so full of jokes, gags and action that you could watch it a handful of times before seeing them all. It's one of those movies that never seems to get old no matter how often I watch it. And since it didn't do too well in theater (a complete shame, btw), Edgar Wright got to make the first release his special edition. All the special features, along with a brilliant blu ray print, make this a movie you need to own.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Didn't really live up to all the hype.  It was okay, but was not hanging on every word and wasn't as steamy as I thought it was going to be.  I have not read the other two in the series and not sure I will.  Has not held my attention like I thought it would.  My recommendation is \\"proceed with caution\\".
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love the game and game play. I don't like that you have to bug your friends or spend cash.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great love story. Just like 50 Shades. Cannot wait for the sequel to see how they end up.....
B001FB55YE|5.0|I don't know why so many people have missed this movie. Maybe they didn't like the last Guy Ritchie movie? Maybe they hate Madonna? Both? Either way, they're missing out. This is movie is fast paced, funny and action packed. The cast is phenomenal. If you like any of Guy Ritchies work, this is not to be missed.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Abby Road\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", Alanis Morrissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Metallica's \\"Metallica\\", Pinkd Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\", The Eagles \\"Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975\\", AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\", Michael Jackson's own \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\", Meat Loaf's \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", Shania Twain's \\"Come On Over\\", the soundtracks of \\"Dirty Dancing\\", \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", \\"Titantic, and \\"The Body Guard\\", Celion Dion's \\"Falling Into You\\", Mariah Cary's \\"Music Box\\", Madonna's \\"Immaculate Collection\\", The Backstreet Boys' \\"Millennium\\", Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the USA\\", Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\".<br /><br />What do all these albums have in common?  All have sold in access of thirty million copies.  These are the heavy hitters, the major albums that have commercially outperformed all of the others.  What else do they have in common?<br /><br />Not one of them comes close to outselling \\"Thriller\\", Michael Jackson's sixth studio album from 1982.  \\"Thriller\\" has sold an estimated 50-110 MILLION copies.  Too put that in perspective, The Beatles total sales is 170 million in the US total, with Elvis's  moving 119 million unites, with Garth Brooks placing third.  That's all records sold however.  (Granted, The Beatles and Elvis' sales figures are a little more staggering globally: The Beatles have moved 1.3 billion copies and Elvis between 900 million and 1 billion.  Those are, however, world wide sales figures of all records sold).<br /><br />Before \\"Thriller\\", the biggest selling record was Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\".  Then, in 1982, \\"Thriller\\" arrived, and the world was changed forever.  \\"Thriller\\" completely rewrote the rules for what music could do commercially - at one point, the album was moving a MILLION UNITS a week.  Success of this magnitude was unimaginable, even going beyond what The Beatles did in the 1960s (as far as sales ofan individual album goes).<br /><br />When Michael and producer Quincy Jones went into the studio, they had their sights set on the stars.  Michael was angry about \\"Off the Wall\\" not winning \\"Record of the Year\\", and was told by Rolling Stone that black people didn't on magazines didn't sell.  Michael wanted to prove just how valuable he would be to the music industry.  And boy did he ever.  \\"Thriller\\" would go on to win 8 Grammys (the most ever won at the time)<br /><br />- Album of the Year<br />- Record of the Year (\\"Beat It\\")<br />- Best Male Pop Vocals (\\"Thriller\\")<br />- Best Male Rock Vocals (\\"Beat It\\")<br />- Best Male R&B Vocals (\\"Billie Jean\\")<br />- Best R&B Song (\\"Billie Jean\\")<br />- Producer of the Year (Qunicy Jones and Michael Jackson)<br />- Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical (Bruce Swedien)<br /><br />Just like a perfect storm, the success of \\"Thriller\\" can be attributed, at least partially, to several different factors.  First, and the most obvious, is the music is utterly fantastic.  The album has something for everything, whether it's hard rock, funk, ballads, soul, shmaltz, or some fantastic bass lines and disco.  The next is the advent MVT [is MTV was just beginning].  Michael made three videos for \\"Thriller\\": \\"Beat It\\" (with West Side Story coreagraphy), \\"Bille Jean\\", and the epic \\"Thriller\\", the most successful video of all time.  All three videos entered into heavy rotation on MTV.  The video of \\"Thriller\\" totally changed what videos could do.  Shot as an actual short fifteen minute film, \\"Thriller\\" is a horror classic with great dancing, memorable makeup, and a spooky story line.  Zombies never looked so good. Michael Jackson also helped break down racial boundaries, being MTV's first black star and even meeting with President Reagan at the White House.  (See what having the biggest selling album ever gets you?  An invite to the White House!).<br /><br />When you're dealing with an album like \\"Thriller\\", that's not a lot to say thathasn't been said before.  Whatever nitpicky comments you wish to make about the album, there is no denying that Michael's music has connected with millions of people the world over.<br /><br />While \\"Off the Wall\\" was a little looser and, appropriately enough, more off the wall, with \\"Thriller\\" we find Michael moving into darker, more paranoid territory that would culminate into full-blown defense mode by the time we get to the 1995 \\"HIStory\\".  For all the fun that \\"Thriller\\" offers, there are some pretty dark undercurrents on the record that Michael would more deeply explore on subsequent records.  This darker edge gives the album a much more durable framework than would otherwise be the case, and makes the music more lasting and impactful.<br /><br />Musically, each track feels calculated to reach as broad an audience as possible.  While it can perhaps be disconcerting that there appears to be such calculation involved, all concerns melt away when you actually here the album itself.  There's a reason it sold so many copies.  We have the claustrophobic funk of\\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\"  (and scariest track Jackson ever recorded), the hard rock of \\"Beat It\\" (with a fantastic guitar solo courtesy of hard rock guitarist virtuso Eddie Van Halen), the smooth soul of \\"Baby Be Starting Something\\" and \\"P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", and the gentle ballads of \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life\\".  Then there's the over-the-top schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet \\"The Girl is Mine\\", which shows Paul at his sappiest and the weakest track on the record.  It was also the first single released from \\"Thriller\\".  \\"Say, Say, Say\\", also recorded in 1982 for as a duet for McCartney's \\"Pipes of Peace\\", is far stronger and just as successful commercially.<br /><br />That leaves us with two songs: \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bille Jean\\".  \\"Thriller\\" is an over the top song about evil creatures that lurk in the night, and features voice-over work from none other than Vincent Price, famous for playing Dracula.  Musically it's among the strongest here, and although the lyrics may be a little corny, Michael makes the song so memorable that any minor objections you can come up with are swept away by his performance and the strength of the actual music itself.  One of my favorites, and a song that gets played a lot out Halloween.<br /><br />Then we have \\"Billy Jean\\", the most contentious song in regards to Quincy Jones and Michael.  \\"Billy Jean\\" has long been one of the staple songs from the early 1980s. However, though massively popular, Quincy Jones, Jackson's producer, vehemently disliked \\"Billie Jean\\", and did not think it was strong enough to be on the album.  Jackson insisted the track to be on the album, and the rest is history.  Jackson said: \\"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\\"  \\"Billie Jean\\" became one of the biggest hits of 1983.  Bruce Swedien mixed the song ninety one times before Jackson was satisfied.  Jones wanted to cut the long intro, but Michael insisted the intro be kept in, because, according to Michael, the intro made him want to dance.<br /><br />And there you have it.  In 2009 after Michael died, \\"Thriller\\" reentered the charts and became the 14th best selling album of that year.  In the years that came after, Michael became increasing bizzare, embroiled in the child sex abuse scandals, holding his son Blanket over a hotel window balcony, and his physical appearance becoming more and more disfigured.  That doesn't change the fact that he made some tremendous music that touched millions of people, and this is some of the best music around, by anyone.<br /><br />*As far as the remakes on the 25th Anniverary edition, they're terrible.  Sorry, we don't need will.i.am., Akron, etc.  They're jsut bad remixes and tarnishing to the legacy of the album.  It would have better to have more unreleased material like the great song \\"For All Time\\".  Jones and Michael apparently worked on over thirty songs for \\"Thriller\\", and more unreleased material would be vastly more interesting than these \\"contemporary\\" remix crap.  With music this timeless you don't need younger artists adding their own flourishes to an acknowledged masterpiece such as this.  \\"Someone in the Dark\\" from the Steven Spielberg movie \\"E. T.: The Extra Terrestrial\\" and \\"Carousel\\" are also good.<br /><br />**Hopefully one day we'll see a \\"Thriller\\" box set similar to the Twenty Fifth Anniversary Edition of \\"Bad\\", which is SOOOO MUCH BETTER than the Twenty Fifth Anniversary of \\"Thriller\\"<br />.<br />.<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Some Additional Info for those interested:<br /><br />\\"Rock With Me\\" become one of the first Billboard Top 100 number one singles of the 1980s, and was the fourth highest selling single of 1980.  Rod Temperton wrote three songs of Jackson on his 1982 album \\"Thriller\\": \\"Baby Be Mine\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"The Lady in My Life\\".  He also wrote three songs from the 1979 album \\"Off the Wall\\": the aforementioned \\"Rock With Me\\", the title cut \\"Off the Wall\\", and \\"Burn The Disco Out\\".<br /><br />Quincy Jones, Jackson's producer, approached Rod Temperton, who wrote the title cut \\"Off the Wall\\" for Jackson's 1979 album, asking him to come up with the title to the next project.<br /><br />Temperton sad the following: \\"Originally, when I did my Thriller demo, I called it Starlight. Quincy said to me, 'You managed to come up with a title for the last album, see what you can do for this album.' I said, 'Oh great,' so I went back to the hotel, wrote two or three hundred titles, and came up with the title 'Midnight Man'. The next morning, I woke up, and I just said this word... Something in my head just said, this is the title. You could visualise it on the top of the Billboard charts. You could see the merchandising for this one word, how it jumped off the page as 'Thriller'.\\"<br /><br />In 1982, Jackson and Jones recorded the song \\"Thriller\\" over a period of eight weeks.  Bruce Swedien, the person responsible for mixing \\"Thriller\\", commented on how instrumental Jones was to the whole recording process:<br /><br />\\"When we started 'Thriller', the first day at Westlake, we were all there and Quincy [Jones, the producer] walked in followed by me and Michael and Rod Temperton and some of the other people. Quincy turned to us and he said, 'OK guys, we're here to save the recording industry.' Now that's a pretty big responsibility - but he meant it. And that's why those albums, and especially 'Thriller', sound so incredible. The basic thing is, everybody who was involved gave 150 per cent ... Quincy's like a director of a movie and I'm like a director of photography, and it's Quincy's job to cast [it]. Quincy can find the people and he gives us the inspiration to do what we do.\\"<br /><br />Michael Jackson and John Landis made the famous \\"Thriller\\" music video.  Landis is famous for such films as \\"National Lampoon's Animal House\\", \\"The Blues Brothers\\", \\"An American Werewolf in London\\", \\"Trading Places\\", \\"Coming to America\\", and \\"The Stupids\\".<br /><br />Conceived more as a short film than a music video, the video famously features Jackson and a large ensemble of zombies dancing on a choreographed dance routine and a script that resembles cheesy 1950s horror films.  Jackson's co-star as the female lead was the \\"Playboy\\" centerfold Ola Ray.  The video has been inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2009, the only music video to ever be added to that famed registry.<br /><br />Michael Jackson made the following statement regarding the video in 1999: \\"My idea was to make this short film with conversation ... in the beginning - I like having a beginning and a middle and an ending, which would follow a story. I'm very much involved in complete making and creating of the piece. It has to be, you know, my soul. Usually, you know, it's an interpretation of the music. [...] It was a delicate thing to work on because I remember my original approach was, 'How do you make zombies and monsters dance without it being comical?' So I said, 'We have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesn't become something that you laugh at.' But it just has to take it to another level. So I got in a room with [choreographer] Michael Peters, and he and I together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making faces in the mirror. I used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on, and I loved doing that. So he and I collaborated and we both choreographed the piece and I thought it should start like that kind of thing and go into this jazzy kind of step, you know. Kind of gruesome things like that, not too much ballet or whatever.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the years since its release, \\"Thriller\\" and The Eagles compilation album \\"Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) have held the title as the top selling album in music history in the American market, though globally \\"Thriller\\" easily beats any other record.
1936719010|5.0|This book has been highly motivational to everyone in my very creative household. My son started writing more music, the other doing art and the third really got into his cartooning! I have been busy with work but I have everything laid out for my first three day weekend (I think I need to revisit the book to get going in the evenings too!). Thanks so much!!!
0307408833|4.0|I bought this book after visiting NYC last year and happening upon the Babycakes store on the Lower East Side.  My first comment is that its true that many of the recipes call for ingredients that may not be readily available.  For instance, I had to special order flours (from Amazon.com, thank you very much).  Once I got past the annoyance of this fact, I have been very happy with the recipes.  To me the strawberry shortcake tastes exactly as I remember it tasting in NYC.  Exactly.  I live in Denver and often I find recipes don't turn out as well because of the altitude.  I haven't experienced that with the recipes in this book.  I have made cupcakes (I rate them 7/10 because they are a little too dense for my liking), brownies (10/10, run don't walk to the stash), all varieties of biscuits (9/10) and a tea bread (8/10).  I have since become a big fan of the biscuit.  They aren't too sweet so you can eat them with something savory for breakfast, or add some frosting and fruit if you want something sweet.  I don't really care if anything is gluten free, but I will say that the gluten-free flours do perform somewhat differently while mixing and baking.  I find its best to be ready to bake the whole batch right away as if you have to let the batter sit, it doesn't seem to taste 100 percent the same.  All that said, I've been very pleased with the book - its nice to have vegan recipes that I don't have to try to manipulate to avoid eggs, etc.  I am kind of surprised to see such negative reviews of this book on this site because I do think its a good book and worth having in your collection.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Edgar Wright is one of my favorite filmmakers, so I'm a bit biased, but this movie is amazing. It's smart, funny and full of love for the zombie genre. As it was said about the movie, it's not a parody, it's an homage. There is a distinct difference. This is it's own story that's meant to show love to the genre. I laughed the whole movie and couldn't wait to buy it. If you love zombie movies, comedies or just anything good, you need to own this!

B002U3CCBK|5.0|An unusual story, with no harsh jars or jolts until the end. I liked the email style, as the characters struggled with emotional frankness: it sort of represented how they could best communicate. I loved the humour, as a break from the story and perhaps flat characters. Dr Alfred very lovabale, as he is so passionate about his work, but has been forced to change by the bureaucracy.

When something goes wrong and I need to replace whatever it was, the staff is very professional and extremely pleasant.<br /><br />In The Horse Whisperer case, I ordered the wrong dvd because of the \\"state\\"# The gal walked me through the returns program and it went very well.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm not a big reader of mystery and crime thrillers, but if this book is in any way indicative of the genre, I should probably start. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. A : Nick is an out-of-work writer who was forced to move out of NYC with his wife to open a bar at his hometown. When his wife goes missing, he becomes the center of a high-publicity murder investigation, where he seems to be the primary suspect, and he has to solve the mystery of his wife's disappearance. Although perhaps a bit formulaic, the story was fantastically executed. The primary characters are interesting and mysterious, which is a delightful feat when the story is told entirely in first person. Flynn also makes a fantastic commentary on the effect of the internet on publishing and the media blitz that often accompanies high-profile criminal cases. Through out the story, you want to find out how these people work, and what's driving them. And the ending is absolutely haunting.
B000UJ48O0|3.0|Great product, Great buy, though when I bought the complete season in this collectors edition \\"style\\" package I did not expect for it to come broken. It was either bad packaging or mishandling through shipment but when I recieved it the clear plastic cover it came with was completely shattered.<br /><br />Also, The box set of DVD's were new itself but for some reason it felt as it could have been in better condition as I was said to have purchased \\"new\\". All - in - all, great deal, great series, brought alot of good memories back to me and the episodes look GREAT on an HD widescreen. Though, I was a bit dissapointed with the broken plastic cover but I encourage any OC fan to purchase this at an awsome price!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My wife told me I flew through this series. By most accounts, I wouldn't consider myself a speed reader, but I can certainly dedicate the time to read a good book, or in this case, a great series. And after finishing The Hunger Games trilogy, I can honestly say this series has it all. The characters, the setting, action scenes galore, great dialogue, and we lived in Katniss's head for the entire three-book ordeal. What a fresh, wonderful character who wouldn't take crap from anyone. *BEGIN SPOILER* She stood her ground through two Hunger Games, and she walked away a stronger, better person, despite the obstacles the Head Gamemakers tossed in her path. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />This was a great read. Did it live up to the precedent of the two tales before it? Probably not. But it's hard to compare greatness. Can I see where readers may have been a bit disappointed after the first two mind-bending reads? Sure. But, again, greatness is a fleeting endeavor. It's like popularity. One minute you have it, the next minute it's moved on to someone else, as it develops a big grin and laughs in your face.<br /><br />To her credit, Suzanne Collins knows how to write a great novel, and to do it three times over is no small feat. Each book stood on its own, and each one was a slightly different type of story, but in the end, readers saw the complete Panem picture, and it's a photo worthy of more than just a passing glance.<br /><br />Maybe I missed the party, the band, the cake, the toasts, and the dancing, but I still feel like there's music playing in the background. Why? Because as I write this, MOCKINGJAY occupies slot #7 of the Amazon Kindle eBooks Bestseller List. I don't know about you, but I plan to enjoy the after-party, \\"and may the odds be ever in your favor.\\"<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B005LAIHPE|4.0|It's aliens vs. the U.S. Navy in this fast-paced action movie.<br /><br />Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard) is the captain of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.  His brother Alex (Taylor Kitsch) has no job and sleeps on Stone's couch.  One night after Alex embarasses himself trying to impress Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker), Stone informs his brother that he must join the Navy to learn some discipline.<br /><br />Fast-forward: Alex is now an officer aboard his own destroyer, the USS John Paul Jones.  He's still in love with Samantha, but she is the daughter of Vice-Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), and the admiral has no use for Alex.  But things are about to change.<br /><br />With no warning, a massive alien force of unimaginable strength has landed in the Pacific Ocean.  An international coalition of ships on manuvers is the only shield.  But, the alien's firepower is superior to anything the ships have.  Soon, ships are left sinking.  A seemingly unbreakable force field is surrounding the aliens, making destruction nearly impossible.  But Alex, after witnessing the destruction of his brother's ship, must spring into action before it's too late.<br /><br />Overall, I thought \\"Battleship\\" was a pretty good movie.  The special effects are the highlight of this film.  The battle sequences are exciting, and the sinking of the John Paul Jones is one of the most exciting and realistic in the movie.  Kitsch, Decker, Skarsgard, and Neeson give good performances in their roles.  Rhianna makes her movie debut as Petty Officer Cora Raikes, and she gives a strong performance.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" packs fast-paced action with thrilling special effects.  Recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Borrowed this book on my kindle and read it in two days. It was so addicting... It is very fast paced and action packed. It's one of those books you get lost in. I can get an image of the jungle, the monkeys, the beach,and all the oysters.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Oh Bonnie Bonnie Bonnie, any song to which you lend your voice is a song to be preserved for the ages. This is a good CD and I've played it almost every day in my car since it arrived. The CD is, as best I can tell, perfect and so was the transaction with the seller. Thank you for making my days better. Bonnie rocks!
B001GMH8SI|4.0|Leaving aside the two following endless controversies: how much the movie was many different or not of the book; and how much what he did was sheer stupidity or sheer idealism, I think what we have ia a very good movie.<br /><br />Well edited, great soundtrack, well acted all the way, incredible photography. As a movie, plain and simple, I think Sean Penn did a great job.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|With such a long and varied career, it's hard to peg these guys with any one musical style.  This disc reminds me a lot of \\"Behaviour\\" from the late 80's and is a bit more mellow than their last effort (Yes).  Regardless, it's classis PSB's with witty lyrics, lush arrangements and a groove you can't help but bob your head to.<br /><br />If you're looking for more of their poppy stuff or songs you can shake your moneymaker to, this is not your disc.  But if you're looking for some great music with lyrics that matter, give it a try - you will NOT be disappointed!
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Fiona's latest album is incredible. No one seems to do it like Fiona does. Impeccable vocals, interesting arrangements and though-provoking lyrics. It does take a couple listens to really get into the new sounds but after doing this I fell for this album hard. Of course, being a hard core fan I would not have missed this album, but I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys an album that you can really sink into.
0920668372|1.0|As a librarian I have tolerantly smiled as many teachers at our school rave about this book.  Personally, I think it is creepy.  For example: the mother climbing into her grown son's window and putting him on her lap and the son, putting his elderly mother on his lap.  If the first one happened, most sons would install better locks and an alarm system.  You don't see the second one happening at nursing homes.  It is demeaning and, well, just creepy and odd.  It does not strike me as an expression of love.  More like a personality disorder.  I love Munsch's humorous stories, i.e., Stephanie's Ponytail.  I share them often with my students.  But I will pass on this one.  The yuck factor is too high for me.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This adapter plugs into the Thunderbolt port on your computer, and provides a female FW800 port, for connecting to a FireWire cable.<br /><br />Using this adapter plus a standard FW800 cable I can connect to my FW800 based external hard drives.<br />Using this adapter plus a 9-pin to 6-pin (FW800 to FW400) cable I can connect to my FW400 based external hard drives.<br /><br />Works flawlessly - no problems running SuperDuper! or TimeMachine to my external hard drives via this adapter.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Gave it three stars because it seems to be a fairly well written game. However I exited it after only completing two puzzles. One on easy and one on hard.<br /><br />I usually really enjoy puzzle games but this one seemed to be unable to hold my intrest. Not sure if it was the elevator music playing in the background or just the general lack of enjoyment while playing.<br /><br />Overall a nice looking game but not too exciting to play. Eventually uninstalled.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Even if you are not a sushi lover, this film aims to inspire. Give it a few minutes and you will find yourself in awe of these master sushi chefs. If I can have half of their enthusiasm when I am their age, I will be grateful.<br /><br />Looking to learn about the master sushi maker, here you go. Soundtrack is great as well (Phillip Glass - \\"Kundun\\")
B00913DPW2|5.0|I am a big fan of puzzle games!  I am still playing this on the Kindle Fire.  This game really is a beautiful game!  It usually takes me a few hours to beat these kind of games, but this one really makes you think!  It also gives you hints if your stuck, if you think its glitching its not, some of the puzzles require you to be very percise the way you drag and drop items from your inventory.  I am a real person...and this is a awesome game...totally worth 2 dollars if not more!
B004LROMWU|5.0|I have only watched the first seanson, and it is amazing. i love love love lvoe LOVE IT!  It is the perfect mix orf drama, si fi, and alien explosions! So my sugestion is BUY It.  it is worth it. I have to find season 2 now.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I first purchased this ebook from Itunes Apple only to find that I couldn't read it on my PC. Then I found the free Kindle download from Amazon. So I purchased the book again, this time from Amazon, and then I was able to read it. Thank you for making it all so easy.  I will be ordering more books soon.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I first saw this watch while shopping at Kholes. I really liked it a lot but it was market at $400! So after I got home I looked it up online and found it on Amazon for just about half the price.<br />It Is a really great watch, I have had it for a few months now and have used it for snorkeling, surfing, swimming and to time my shorter runs.<br /><br />I will mention a few draw backs. The center of the watch band is a very high polish finish. It will get scratched and marred from just normal everyday wear.<br /><br />The day after I go my watch I noticed a very fine hairline scratch in the crystal. I am not even sure when it happened but it was a little disappointing that the crystal wasn't tougher. After that I have been very careful about the crystal and there have been no further scratches.<br /><br />Lastly I wish that the chronograph timer would measer time longer than one hour. Unless you are doing something for under an hour don't expect to know how long it took you because after an hour the timer resets itself automatically to zero.<br />Aside from that I love my watch. It is stylish and functional.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|O nce I started reading I could not put this book down. It was like I just had to know what was gonna happen next. I say it's an absolute must read!!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I bought this little guy for I could not bear the [[ASIN:B003BYRGKY V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone (Gunmetal Black)]] sound signature (everybody makes mistakes right?). While they are the most comfy headphones I got, the bass overshadowed every part of the mids. They also eat a lot of battery power for a 32 ohms headphone.<br /><br /> Luckily I could survive this purchasing mistake due to the help of the little FIIO E6 which I bought after some research for its EQ options and the possibility of using a [[ASIN:B003UCESP8 FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] so no battery will be drained from the power hungry V-Modas. I found that the third setting, the blue colored led option boosted the mids so nicely that made a huge improvement in SQ.<br /><br />Later on, about 6 months ahead the Crossfades got broken in the left side plastic piece that holds the headband so I got them replaced by the glorious [[ASIN:B007TRUY6C V-MODA Crossfade M-80 On-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone - White Pearl]] that are one world appart. Clear balanced , efficient and portable too. I got a complete eargasm as a replacement set. The M80's are rated at 28.8 ohms which means a slight less battery drain but in the real world is a more efficient headphone. Before I plugged the M80's I used an [[ASIN:B002F9MFTS Akg K518Lewht K 518 Le Limited Edition Headphones (White)]] with the Fiio in the flat EQ (no led) with 320K mp3's with very good results.<br /><br />It turns out that the little FIIO actually flattens the M80 soundstage and make it sound a little artificial and dull. So for a better set of headphones this little guy can do more harm than good although it can work very well with some sets that lack bass or have a noticeable bump in the lower mids that makes the sound veiled or muddy. For the Crossfade LP it is a miracle. For the M80 it is not a compliment neither a necessity.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My kindle was a gift from my wife and daughter. I love the product, but the lack of a cover and the ability to<br />\\"prop\\" it up (kept sliding down) and enjoy without having to hold it every second was very frustrating.<br /><br />I looked pretty hard at the products available on Amazon, thought about the options and then bought this Microshell.<br /><br />It's simple to install. Simple to use and does the job(s) I needed;<br /><br />1) Fantastic job of protecting the device from the occasional drop<br />2) Great job of providing a standing position to allow use while your hands are otherwise occupied.<br /><br />Great product. Well designed. Lightweight. Easy to use. Very functional. Looks kinda kool too!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app. The weater at my touch and beautiful too. I have my weather channel for radar but use this for the forcast and daily ..nightly westher. Love the background!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I purchased this CD because I love the songs \\"Bad Romance\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\" from watching the videos via Internet since June 2012. I wanted to hear more Lady Gaga songs, and these don't disappoint. I work in health care and strangely enough these songs inspire me in my work and make me more productive in what I do. If this is a near duplicate of what I said about Lady Gaga's Born This Way CD, it's because I purchased both CDs at the same time because I couldn't get enough Gaga!!!
B000GRUS22|5.0|Its one of those cds where, the more you listen to it the more you like it.  Its so cosmic sounding, I feel as if I am traveling though space on a mission or something. Love it!
B005J7K964|3.0|I was excited to see Kino finally released Moroder's version of Metropolis. Unfortunately they have mastered the Blu Ray from an old work print they found lying around as opposed to mastering it from the negative.<br /><br />I saw Moroder's version when it was released and it was in better condition than the print they have used for this release. It 's unfortunate because it all comes down to money. Mastering from the negative would have cost Kino more than mastering from an existing print. Thumbs down on that choice.<br /><br />Amazon however, shipped extremely fast, as usual. I'm always happy with their service.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|if you played and liked 100 floors then you will like this one but there is one problem not many levels i think i finished this game in like a hour i think it has maybe 7 or 8 levels they needed to add more levels before putting it out but it is a cool game so maybe they may update and give more levels
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I purchased this CD because I love the songs \\"You and I\\" and \\"The Edge of Glory\\" from watching the videos via Internet since June 2012.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love this app. From the first time i started using it i haven't been able to go one day without it. I learn something new everyday and have so many projects lined up. My only issues are that i dont think you can change the title for each pin after you pin it and sometimes it takes a few tries to open it and it freezes up on me. But overall it's awesome!
B000AU9UYC|3.0|The DVD was not new and had been rewrapped to be given that appearance. Was shipped fast and the DVD does work
B004SBQGHS|5.0|angry birds always a fun game love playing it on my kindle fire should enjoy rven more on the hd screen from the new kindle fire hd i ordered
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. I would stay up late nights reading through the first book. Once I finished that book I couldn't wait for my next trip to Barnes n' Nobles so I downloaded it off of amazon. The story is very erotic and descriptive yet the characters are so well developed that I overlook the strange warmth I feel when reading E.L. James's lustful scenes and focus on the actually storyline (granted is also very good). I will be reading this series over and over again. If E.L. James ever came out with a book just in Christian Grey's point of view, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Loved this series thoroughly.
B000S88JTS|1.0|Bought this because of other reviews for our 9yr old son for when we travel. He hated it, I hated it! Save your money!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book; good story line and kept me interested with an on going pace I like. I have suggested others I know read it!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I do love a good match 3 game but find they grow old quickly. This game solves that problem. A flip or two and you have an entirely new board to look at-this will never be the same game twice.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|If you've paid attention to this series, you already know it's been a wild ride.  Then comes season four.  It's incredible to see the day & night transition of Walt White when pushed to the limits.  The sacrifices he makes to stay ahead as well as sparing his life & protecting Jesse.<br /><br />  One of my favorite series of all time.  It's interesting to see the consequences of one's actions simply does come with the territory.  If you liked the Breaking Bad series up to this point, go check out season 4.
B005DI9906|5.0|The 1939 version of the Four Feathers is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has all the elements of a great adventure movie. The hero(Clements) must return the four feathers (a sign of cowardice) to his friends who sent them to him. His harrowing deeds of valor that he goes to are the main topic of the film, but not are all of them. It is a love story too; and shows the lengths a man will go through for love and honor.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|Absolutely love maroon 5. Enjoy about 75% Of the songs on each of their previous albums, but nit this one. Only like 3 or 4 songs. I guess that's still good, considering the state of music albums these days, but subpar for them IMO.
0525953728|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and at 300 pages, it was easy to get through in only a few hours. Unlike another recent Navy Seal book, it doesn't get bogged down with one training after another after another so much so that you lose interest.  The author assumes that the reader will at least have a passing knowledge of Bud/s and hell week and so does not really go into that part of becoming a SEAL. He does go into how he became a part of DEVGRU, which isn't something you see a lot in books so that was interesting and he keeps things flowing as he goes through different operations.<br /><br />My one criticism of the book, and I realize that this probably didn't even cross his mind, was his portrayal of \\"Jen\\" Women in the military and the intelligence community have a hard enough time being treated like equals and having her portrayed as a blithering, freaking idiot lying on the floor in a fetal position crying is just a slap in our face. Next time, just leave her ass out of the book. Seriously, just leave her out. I could go on but I won't. To me, that is the one big drawback for the book and the one reason I can't give it five stars. 4 1/2 stars, yes but 5, no.
B001C3L2C4|3.0|The music is just as I remembered when listening to the album back in 1970. I didn't like the dead spots between the poem and songs on the MP3. The album went from the poem right into the song. Of course Moody Blues are great musicians ahead of their time. Their music is timeless.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This. Is an AWESOME game and I think everyone should get this game:) just get this game awesome...when I'm in school I play in class lol:)
B0083ZEW44|4.0|I enjoyed the way the book revealed the rigid class divisions of English society at the time. Great character development revealing the spiritual dimensions of people, especially for Margaret and Helen. Lyrical treatment of place and countryside.
B007TML4EI|4.0|physics games are good on hand held devices. when you have 5 to 50 mins to kill you cant go wrong.this game is better than most. protecting your dummy is what makes this a little different. multiple levels of arrows, flaming arrows, laser, a battering  ram, spears, cannons, or just boulders trying to destroy your dummy. its challenging but not too hard. the engineering/architect type game done better. if it wasnt for the occasional crash of the game (during start up) i'd give it 5 stars.
0525953728|5.0|I am so glad I purchased and read this book.  It is a fast paced, action packed book.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  It is nice to know the truth about how everything went down.  He talks about other missions as well and the how and why he became a Navy Seal.  He also notes that some of the proceeds will be donated to military charites (it is noted in the book which one).  God Bless our Troops for all they do for us!!!
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|Likeable enough film. Has its charm. Just not best picture material. Not even worthy of a best picture nomination. Worth a rental. Period.
B0091P6392|5.0|Not only is it easy to view video from amazon and to move them to other devices, but it was one of the best episodes of this show yet.
B008K8H9C6|2.0|I think its way to hard for children. I have been playing it and even I have a hard time with Amazing Alex. Did they Demo this?
B006OB3K56|4.0|This is a worthy follow-up film by Steve McQueen after his brilliant  and chilling \\"Hunger\\" also starring Michael Fassbinder.  It is about a man in a big unforgiving city on the brink of self-destruction relying on purchasing sex as temporary relief.  Both Fassbinder and Mulligan are very fine with fitting photograhy and music as if from antiseptic lenses and pipes.  Not an easy film to sit through but one must admire its makers and actors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had nothing to read, went to amazon to see if anything jumped out..saw some reviews for Wool so I bot the 5 part set. I had no expectations, which perhaps made these books even more amazing. Slightly reminiscent of Stephen kings the dome, but w such well fleshed characters that it was far better. You will unequivocally not be disappointed !!
B001SAO38Q|4.0|If you enjoy this unique piece of '60s-cinema memorabilia-- a rare example of a superimposed contemporary setting and sensibility accentuating a film rather than dating it (as opposed to something like, say, 1967's gaudy and self-indulgent 'Casino Royale')-- I strongly recommend picking up the all-region 40th anniversary Blu-ray edition.  'The Italian Job' (1969) is restored in amazing detail, showcasing exquisite location photography throughout numerous countrysides and cityscapes in England, Ireland and Italy, as well as some equally impressive interiors and stunt-driving footage.  And if that isn't motivation enough, this release also includes a new, informative commentary track with original screenwriter Kenneth Martin and a thoroughly revamped making-of documentary (that, irrespective of the PAL warning in the product specs above, is viewable on U.S. devices), in addition to commentary with producer Michael Deely, a deleted scene and other extras that can be found on the 2003 Paramount DVD.  TIJ may not be the greatest comedy/caper picture of all time, but it's a fun, smart and handsome production with a host of superb British character actors (and, of course, the impeccable Michael Caine) here likely looking and sounding as fine as it ever will.  Movie earns 4-minus stars, presentation 4 1/2 stars.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is definately owed some props on this book.  What's funny is i kept looking at her picture trying to figure out how she could come up with this plot, she just doesnt look the part.(Stephen King)  I must say i was shocked at the ending, i never saw it coming.  i like to think im a mystery wizard so i had it all worked out and i was so wrong but i dont feel like i was played, just really suprised at the twist and turn of events.  i also usually hate books that go back and forth, usually something gets lost, but not here. it was an excellent read.  i will keep this book on my shelf to re-read at later time, this is no goodwill donation.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This is the first movie I've seen with Stewart.  What is wrong with her?  Does she always act in this manner, or was she preoccupied with her affair?  The few words she spoke, she stated them worse than when someone reads aloud from a book.  Her \\"fighting\\" speech - she just yelled the words out.  Huh?!  Has she no experience in human suffering, that she can not remotely fathom what it would be like to be locked in an underground prison cell for so many years, to lose both parents, to see the depths of sorrow in her kingdom?... so that she can not bring these emotions to her acting?<br /><br />And what was happening with the last scene (coronation scene)?  Why was she just standing there & almost pretending to have a 'climax' ???<br /><br />The Queen & the Huntsman were great.  The scenery was beautiful, the effects (ok, except for that one scene) worked well.  But .... the main character is a joke......!!!
B00005RIKI|5.0|I AM AN OLD GUY.  I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE<br />RECORDS YEARS AGO.  STILL EXCELLENT, BUT THE BONUS TRACKS MAKE THE DISC.  I HAVE NOW LISTENED TO TRACK #9 MR BANKER FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME.  FOR OLD ROCKERS AND YET TO BE ROCKERS!!!!
0525953728|5.0|First the hype about this being a politically motivated book is completey unfounded.  Also, amazingly, the author manages to tell an electrifying, humourous story without once resorting to blasphemy.  What a concept.  Couldn't put it down. Some of the stuff he did, like parachuting into shark infested water off the coast of Somalia carrying a ton of equipment on his back, are thrilling to say the least.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting and unpredicatable books. I rarely find a book that makes me keep thinking about it after I am done. The first one was my favorite, but the rest were also good.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Prometheus is a visually stunning and entertaining sci-fi movie that largely succeeds despite having elements of its story which sometimes feel half-baked. Personally, I was drawn in by the visuals and the over-all pacing of Prometheus and had a good enough time with it's eerie atmosphere, shocks and thrills - enough that I was able to overlook some weak characterizations and a story that, despite some big themes, ended up being plagued by implausible details.<br />  What saves the movie for me is the fact that at the core of the story are some BIG QUESTIONS - about the possible origins of humanity and what our place might be in a bigger universe where we have only begun to understand our place. So few science-fiction movies even ATTEMPT to tackle ideas that have these kinds of implications, so I have to give Prometheus credit for actually TRYING to sail into deeper waters. On the flip-side, Prometheus also had enough thrilling pulp genre trappings (ooh, rocket ships and alien Monsters!) that the 12 year-old inside me was kept happy.<br />  The things that are really missing in this movie are three-dimensional characters whose motivations make consistant sense. At this point, I have to compare Prometheus with ALIEN - especially because Prometheus trades so freely in the mythology of the universe created by ALIEN. In ALIEN, all the characters were fully realized, distinct from each other, believable, and crucial to the story. Prometheus has too many characters - many of whom are not given much to do and could easily be removed without having any impact on the story whatsoever. Other characters are a little bit too obvious about their purpose - overtly stating their symbolic role, where it would of been more interesting for us to figure that out by their actions as they respond to unfolding events. There are also moments where the actions taken by characters go completely against reasonable logic and even their established motivations - simply bending conveniently to satisfy where the story wants to go.<br />  For me, the faults were easily overlooked and I was swept up in the hypnotic rhythm of the visuals and the shear SCALE of the thing. I enjoyed the aesthetic sensibility of the production design and the performances of Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, which anchored the movie. Prometheus was a good time and did most everything I expected an ALIEN prequel to do, including giving me a few visceral shocks that were delivered in surprising ways. Prometheus isn't as good as ALIEN, but I was able to enjoy it on its own terms.satisfy where the story wants to go.<br />  For me, the faults were easily overlooked and I was swept up in the hypnotic rhythm of the visuals and the shear SCALE of the thing.

B0086700CM|4.0|I think it's a great game to get. Especially for free! It has a few glitches but they're not a huge problem. Overall it's worth getting :)
B007NR9WBG|5.0|I have waited a long time for this movie to be re-released. I live in the area of North Carolina it was filmed and see the buildings used in the film all the time. With all the tragedy surrounding Natalie Woods death during production, as well as being a great 'before its time' story, it made me very happy to be able to see this film on dvd finally. Very thought provoking movie.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I loved the story all the way to the end and then it just pooh no more and there should have been more there could have been more but nothing, and I love the KING but this time he let me down down down!!!!!!Not much more to say then that.
0345535421|5.0|What can I say about this book? This is the BEST series I've read since 'Lord of the Rings'! When I first started reading the book I was floored-it was that good! then I watched the HBO series, which is a little different, but I think George R.R. Martin is a genious!

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I was interested in the pacific trail. What I found was an instant connection with a woman who was lost and trying to make sense of her dysfunctional life. Also I wasn't hiking the trail with her I could relate on many other levels with what was happening in her life. It was healing for me to read her journey and her story.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the book was her lack of fear about what she undertaking. I could not understand this. From hiking alone, leaving her name as a woman who was hiking alone in a public log book, to taking rides from strangers....I couldn't decide if she was naive or just that out of touch. It did take away from the story somewhat.<br /><br />I did decide to read another book about a couple hiking the trail. From the beginning the fear is mentioned and a constant theme of the book. Just feels more real. Will review when I am finished.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I ordered the 5th, 6th and 7th seasons as a gift for my wife to complete the set. She is very happy with the additions. These folks are great to work with.

B005FISBTO|5.0|As usual each season brings a new mystery with a lot of intrigue. Season 6 was just as good as any other season. They were all great. The only problem is that I now can't wait for the new season. I don't like to see reviews give too much information about the show because they will give away a lot of the anticipation and mystery. I think Dexter is a show that you must have seen from the beginning of season 1 and all other seasons to understand how the show and people progress through their lives.
6304602944|5.0|THESE TWO CHARACTERS REALLY WORK WELL TOGETHER AND ALONG WITH THE COMICAL BANTERING BACK N FORWARD.  THE MOVIE IS FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND ACTION,  AFTER BEING SET UP, TANGO AND CASH ARE SENT TO PRISON RIGHT INTO THE GENERAL POPULATION.

IN BETWEEN ALL THE BOOM, CRASH, BIFF ETC, A LITTLE ROMANCE AND FUNNY SITUATIONS. ENJOY
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|To avoid all confusion, ignore all other reviews! Critical morons with no ear for music. If you haven't purchased this new 2012 remix yet, and you are a KISS fan, don't hesitate. The new mix is very impressive. The audio is more equally balanced and rich. I am still very happy with the 1997 remaster, but also pleased with the new audio mix as well. The sound is crisp, and all instruments, vocals and effects are clearly audible. I like being able to have two different audio mixes of this album. If I sound prejudice, it's only because Destroyer is my ultimate favorite KISS album! Everyone has their own musical ear. Some like it loud, with a lot of bass. Some like more treble. Some want the sounds to blend more....on and on and on. Why nit pick and critique every little detail? Also, in spite of what some of the other reviews say, I have found nothing wrong with Flaming Youth. But, if it makes you happy, none of you noticed the slight record pop sound at 13 seconds in on Great Expectations? Listen and Enjoy! Whether you purchase the CD or download, I think you will be very happy indeed. A final note on the packaging.... the actual CD is impressive as well. It's an all black disc, both sides, with the original Casablanca label from the first edition vinyl release.
B008602KQI|3.0|Cantiss was great, but the supporting cast was not so good. Sutherland as Snow was a joke. overall the acting was at best mediocer. the master of ceremmonies was pretty good. the tributes as whole seemed pretty nonshalant about there situation. they are all going to die but one. you would never know it by the way they acted. still i enjoyed the movie but it could have been better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wasn't into reading the Trilogy at all but from the first book I knew it would be good. I am so sad to see that there is no book 4. Please continue the series. If you are skeptical about reading this book dont be it is great!!!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I got this album for 5 bucks after having purchased textbooks on amazon. I was browsing for some good music and Amazon suggested The Lumineers. I'm happy. $5 spent well.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am not one to sit and read books, but these I could not put down. It was not just sexy but very good over all.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|<disclaimer: I have worked with Mark on & off for 6 years - I bought the copy of this book><br /><br />The second of the series is a book that gives Jeff Aiken & Daryl Haguen, the reoccurring characters from Zero Day, more of an emotional & deeper context.  This gave the characters motives more depth & more believability to the reader. Combining things that have happened (the Stuxnet virus), with real world drama (Iranian Nuclear development) & daily mundaneness (governmental bureaucratic infighting)  The hacks used against users are not just believable, but pretty possible.  Some scary stuff indeed.<br /><br />For me, Marks books are the most satisfying in this techo-thriller genre.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing so much about the fifty shades of grey book, i couldn't wait to read it, i wanted to know what all the hub bub was about. It is a great book, with a great story line, I'm excited about reading the next to in the series, i hope to start on them soon because if the ending of the first book gives any insight into the next, its going to be very interesting.
B00005RYKV|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY love this CD. It is my all time favorite. I listen to it I'm surprise it still works. These are some of the best musicians. I purchased it several months ago and I will never tire of it, each song as good as the next. Some CDs have a few good songs on them and the rest are mediocra to terrible, each of the songs on this CD are as good as the others, not bad song on the CD. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Love it.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I was really excited to read this book because most of the reviews were pretty favorable. I am a big fan of fantasy novels so I thought this would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, I was very wrong. This novel has been impossible to get through. The writing is way too verbose and includes way too many unnecessary  details. The characters are not believable and the relationships between them are even less believable. I am sincerely disappointed in this novel and in myself for choosing to read it. I would not recommend this novel to anyone, as you will surely be disappointed should you decide to read it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow ! This book was very exciting giving you incite to a taboo sex life that isn't always talked about. Quite a sexual education.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great read, a \\"can't put it down\\" book.  The twists and turns will keep you surprised and guessing, but you'll rarely be right.  On the downside, the book has no strong male characters.  They are all overshadowed by superior women.  This comes across as bashing a few times which is too bad.  I still highly recommend it.
0316066524|5.0|Most of the the book we come across people who are mysterious, obsessed and damaged. There are clues in the book that show deep down what it's characters want and how they suffer for their inability to cope, including the servile nature of TV watching, advertising, addiction, and whoring (fame or otherwise...). Like in Tennis, those who serve the best usually win. As readable as Spillane, and as deep as you want to take it, you will never read another book that is as simple to understand and enlightening to many truths as reading Infinite Jest.
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn goes where other writers don't dare. She does crazy, and she does it well. The dark humor, the realism, the dysfunctional characters. Don't miss out on the opportunity to escape into other peoples crazy, crafted beautifully by Gillian Flynn.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|This is a tricky film to review, because it was based on a true story, and the writers / directors / editors chose not to veer far from the historical narrative.<br /><br />In short, this means the last quarter of the film is a bit of a weird mess, unless you (the viewer) have taken time to learn about the real-life events first.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling's character was flat and odd throughout; perhaps this was on purpose? In any event, this movie does not leave me impressed with his acting skills.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst, on the other hand, is marvelous. She makes this a movie worth seeing. Frank Langella is also awesome in his role.
0956031609|5.0|The World Unseen is a story of forbidden love in 1950s South Africa. Apartheid has just become the law of the land. Segregation is not only limited to blacks and whites, but also extends to coloreds and Indians.  The ultimate goal for women is to be provided a good match for a husband, have children, keep house, and cook well. A successful wife is a subservient one.<br /><br />The protagonist, Amina, wants a different life. She wants to dress in clothes in which she feels the most comfortable. She wants to own a business with a colored man. She wants to love whom she wants. And she does not care what anyone thinks of her.<br /><br />Shamim Sarif has an engaging writing style and her depiction of setting and characterizations are exceptional.<br /><br />The World Unseen is the kind of book for which you sit in your favorite chair, with your favorite beverage, and cozy up with it for a long afternoon.<br /><br />This is one of the few books that I have read recently that I did not want to end.<br /><br />I wish it had a sequel.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I've been a big fan of the Evangelion anime since I was little, even if I didn't understand it. Once I finally reached that age of understanding it, I feel even more in love.<br /><br />Well 5 years later, they make Evangelion 1.0 (or 1.11 for those who watch blu-ray).  I was kind of skeptical of it at first, but being the fan I am, watched it.  I ended up loving 1.11 and buying it to put in my special collection.  Of course I couldn't wait to see 2.22.  Well, I can say I was not disappointed at all.<br /><br />Evangelion 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance is a masterpiece.  Easily the best movie I have seen all year, even better than The Dark Knight Rises.  I'm just ashamed it took me this long to watch it.  If you enjoyed 1.11, then you will absolutely adore this one.  This movie introduces some new characters, and starts molding the story away from the original anime, and does an amazing job at doing it.  I thought the first one had some sweet scenes, this movie has straight up epic scenes.  The animation is does extremely nicely, the story is paced perfectly, and the action scenes have you on the edge of your seat through out the entire movie.  Even after the credits end, the movie has a \\"hidden\\" scene that sent chills down my spine, even if it was only 10 seconds long.<br /><br />Point of this review?  If you enjoy mecha, anime, or just anime, WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really can't complain about this bag. It has enough room for my Nikon D90, a telephoto lens, and three or four other lenses, plus my accessories and equipment. The compartments can be easily adjusted with velcro tabs to fit your lenses perfectly (or you can remove them entirely, like I did to make a long compartment for my telephoto). The bag seem to be quality built, and the zipper tabs are rubbery and have AMAZON printed on them. The bag's \\"flap\\" has several stacked pockets and layers. There are exterior pockets and straps for added cargo space, and the shoulder straps are augmented with chest and waist belts too, which is perfect if you need to strap the bag down tight for a rough ride or climb. I don't think this bag's padding would protect the contents from a serious collision, but for life's routine bumps and thumps it will do fine. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the bag.

0061684384|4.0|I purchased this after getting hooked on the show via Netflix reruns... I love great tattoo work, so I thought this would be a good book to add to my collection. And I was right - Very visually appealing from cover to cover, wonderful artistry, and a collection of great tattoos, as well as lots of bio on Kat Von D. Just like LA Ink - Plus more tattoo info and minus the silly dramas of the show lol.  Good price - glad I bought it :-)

When I heard that she was releasing a full album I couldn't wait for it to come out, and was not disappointed at all.<br /><br />This girl is the real deal. All of her songs are personal and beautiful. I've never heard someone write with such honesty. Her album is as good as her live shows, raw, and real. Soko is a true artist and I highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music.

B008IGP8QE|4.0|This is a good Disney Channel CD, filled with catchy songs from the show.<br /><br />However, it raises a number of questions. First, where's Ally? These are all Austin songs and on the show Ally has sung a bit (she actually has a better voice than he does). Second, why aren't all of the songs from the show on here? There have been some clips of tunes on the series that are not included here as full songs. And, most importantly, does Ross Lynch really sing these? On the show he obviously lip syncs with tracks. The few times he has had to sing by himself on the program he doesn't sound like the voice here. This sounds like an older person singing the tunes. There's even one song on the CD that doesn't sound like the same voice as the rest. Remember that Disney used another voice for some of Zac Efron's first High School Musical tunes--is this the same or did they just autotune Ross so he sounds better than he really is?<br /><br />In all it's a good deal at $10 for 14 cuts and kids will enjoy most of the tunes.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I have read the Mars series many times and loved the movie about how John Carter got to Mars. I really hope they either do all the books, or at least make 2 or 3 movies out of the rest of the series. They are very enjoyable.
B0068THAGY|1.0|This movie falls flat on its face trying to be the \\"ET\\" of today's generation. A predictable plot, tired character roles, and a boring take on \\"other life\\" are all throw into a blender and comes out a muddy, soupy mess in the end. There is no satisfaction to be had watching this film if you are over the age of 12. If you are 11 and younger - enjoy!
B008B0QH5S|5.0|For readers wondering what I am referring to in the title,it only refers to a childhood game I made up shortly after I discovered Pet Shop Boys for the first time. It was the way everyone else did via \\"West End Girls\\" and somehow or other their sound became refreshingly addictive and captivating. In a very healthy way. The pair did a lot to teach me the value of crafting an great pop song,no matter what contemporary technology assisted in creating the music itself. Also related was my understanding of the value of melodicism in dance music. As for Neil and Chris and their relationship to the dance music world,they've seen it all in my lifetime anyway. The post disco period in which they came together via Bobby Orlando,having that great one/two punch with [[ASIN:B000002U9K Please]] and [[ASIN:B000002UD7 Actually]] and along the way helping Dusty Springfiled become a star again. Well for one shinning moment. But the duo soldiered on. Wrote and produced for Liza Minnelli and,in the 90's survived a massive assault on anything associated with the 80's,particularly dance music with wonderful ventures such as [[ASIN:B000002UWL Behavior.]] and [[ASIN:B000002USP Very]]. They beat the odds many years ago. And if they'd retired after the mid 1990's,it would've still seemed like a long and creatively lucrative career. But that didn't happen. They are still around. And they are still expanding what they do further into different arenas.<br /><br />  Always great commentators on the world around them,in particular with Neil's lyrical wit and intellect,there's plenty of source material for this new album to draw on. Overall there's a feeling of acceptance of all kinds of relationships,beginning and leaving them. And musically? Well the album starts off with leaving and also has another song \\"A Face Like That\\". These showcase the vitality of the musically layered eurodance/pop/post disco sound the band pioneered in their salad days. Even in the world of bassy,effects laden EDM sounds everywhere at this current time,there's still a place for their more subtle approach to their chosen genre. The more ambient side of their nature is reflected in \\"Invisable\\",as well as a more uncertain side of their personality. The wit is most present on two songs,both in the more abstract electronica mode. \\"Your Early Stuff\\" sounds like a conversation from someone to Neil and Chris about their stubbornness in sticking around when their are newer and more popular faces in their crowd. \\"Ego Music\\" is more obviously self explanatory in terms of exploring the consciousness of an internally shallow pop star trying to convince everyone how \\"deep\\" he is to gain recognition and likely sexual encounters.  \\"Give It A Go\\" explores a modern take on the world of 60's Northern Soul,a cross between the world Dusty Springfield helped usher in and people like Adele have continued recently.<br /><br />  \\"Breathing Space\\",\\"Memory Of The Future\\",\\"Everything Means Something\\" and \\"Winner\\" all have an epic flavor blending live instruments with Chris Lowes electronic productions. The song that actually impresses me most in a way is the closer \\"Requim in Denim And Leopardskin\\". Lyrically it seems to speak of reflections on the past pointing to the possibility of either musical continuation or retirement. Neil's conversational lyrical poetry is at an all time high on this song. But most impressive is the sleek,percussive and rather funky disco/dannce/pop musical sound of the song featuring what sounds like a completely live band. It shows once and for all (for those not quite convinced) their type of dance compositions can function totally outside the electronic effects they often have. And there's also another exciting thing about this. The lyrics all tell stories as always. But as always they also have an ambiguity about them. In fact,my particular views on the intent of this lyrics could be completely backwards to what they really are. Having ready their book [[ASIN:0306804948 Pet Shop Boys, Literally]],Neil & Chris are one of a group of people I would love to talk to about pop music and it's influence on society. They are able in their music to be entertaining,witty and even mildly cheeky sometimes without being cynical or off putting. If this is to be their final release,well it may in fact be their [[ASIN:B0025KVLUQ Abbey Road]] in terms of musical quality. On the other hand if they intend to soldier one? Well,looking forward to what's coming up tomorrow.op Boys, Literally]],Neil & Chris are one of a group of people I would love to talk to about pop music and it's influence on society.

0307951529|5.0|I wish I had this book five years ago when I first jumped into entrepreneurship. What Guillebeau does so well is lay a foundation for all the areas you need to succeed at simultaneously to make your venture a success. He also fills the book with a huge number of examples of people starting businesses for very little money. His thesis is well supported: yes, you can truly start a business for just a hundred bucks. This is remarkable - and also exciting.<br /><br />To start off, he devotes over 40 pages to an area that other business books often gloss over:  making sure that what we will offer the world provides real value and matches the entrepreneur's genuine interests. This sounds simple but many people make bad choices in the type of business they start and make it very difficult to thrive over the long haul.  For example, given the importance of creating good content for your website, you better be truly interested in what you're selling or you will flame out and sound disingenuous.<br /><br />However, my favorite sections of the book were Parts II and III where Guillebeau gets into detailed ways to craft a compelling offer, launch your product, promote it, increase sales and then target your ideal business size/lifestyle.<br /><br />Weaknesses? He could have focused on one or two examples and gone deep and detailed (like in Warrilow's \\"Built to Sell\\") rather than wide with many examples. However, I personally liked his approach and found his points better supported when I was able to see how multiple people created, for example, a successful product launch.<br /><br />Guillebeau is a very successful entrepreneur and I frankly think he's doing us a big favor by giving us an in-depth look at how he does it. The vast majority of successful entrepreneurs don't have the time or interest to share these details. I'm glad he made the time. Highly recommended.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|The inability of this app to save downloaded music to my external SD card earns it a two star deduction. That's kinda the whole point of me getting an SD card.

I really like most of the rest of the app, but that simple limitation makes it really hard to love the app in total.

B0074MZSWW|2.0|I am a fan of many types of music, though my roots are mostly blues influenced classic rock (Hendrix, Zeppelin, Allman bros, Clapton, etc).  I heard both Hold On and Hang Loose on the radio and loved both songs.  I bought the CD hoping for more of the same type of awesome guitar riffs that really stand out in these two songs.  The combination of the unique funky/bluesy guitar work and Brittany's vocals was fantastic on these two.<br /><br />Unfortunately it stops there (for me).  The rest of the songs are great if you want to hear Brittany sing.  But the extent of the guitar work is basically just picking through chord progressions.  There are a couple of decent songs, but nothing I will be listening to very often.  I will pop this CD in once every few weeks to hear Hang Loose and Hold On, but that's all (maybe on a long roadtrip I'll listen to the whole CD again).  I would recommend just downloading these two songs instead of buying the whole album.

1416972250|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />The events of the first two books in The Mortal Instruments series come to a fantastic head in this exciting and gripping third installment. Clary's mother, Jocelyn, is in trouble, and Clary believes that she is the only one who can save her. However, in order to do so, Clary must travel to Alicante, the city of the Shadowhunters... even if it means that she is breaking the law. Danger arises when the evil Valentine's master plan starts to take shape, and Clary has to help the Shadowhunters realize that they need to work with the Downworlder vampires, werewolves, and fairies in order to prevail.<br /><br />The perfect combination of action, emotion, and shocking plot twists, City of Glass turned out to be quite possibly my favorite book in the series so far. Clare manages to delve more deeply into the psyche of her main characters, drawing forth an emotional response from the reader as we quickly realize just how much we do care about Jace, Clary, Simon, and co. Jace, for example, developed stunningly in this third installment, and despite the whole woe-is-me tortured soul thing he had going on in the beginning of the book, the book begins to peel back the layers and reveal that he truly is just as scared as everyone else, particularly when it comes to Clary and the depth of his feelings towards her. Clary is a fantastic heroine, as I've said before--she's unsure of herself and frightened of what she is capable of, but at the same time, she possesses such an inner strength that I personally think is grounded by the fantastic people she has in her life, and her love for them.<br /><br />The plot twisted and turned like no other in this one, creating a rollercoaster ride that had me holding on for dear life. The villain, for example, had quite a few tricks up his sleeve, and he had more to his plan than what I--or any of the Scooby gang (Clary and co.)--anticipated. And there were revelations (which I can't discuss without spoiling the rest of the book, mind you) that blindsided me and made me wonder why I hadn't realized it from the start. Though in some parts I felt like the dialogue or the descriptions were a bit repetitive, Clare also has a true knack for writing fight sequences and dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Can I just take an aside moment to say thank goodness the whole brother-sister thing between Jace and Clary is resolved?

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't say it's the best because it's the first I tried. It does everything I need and I've never had the urge to try another. It has great study plans, it's easy to use and it works great online, on my kindle fire and my android phone.  The community is awesome too.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Rather fun and enjoyable, but not too much so. Doesn't lend itself to overplaying there for burning it out too quickly. Basically he runs on his own and you tap to make him fly up, release to drop down ccollecting coins as you go to turn in for in game rewards.
B008LAO7C8|5.0|Since enough has been written about the music, I won't bother. This is a triple gatefold presentation with a decent sized poster. Standard gram, black. Comes with an MP3 download. Overall a good 3LP package. Amazon actually shipped this double boxed, so mine arrived MINT. Hope this helps.... Kirk OUT!
B005D1Q57S|5.0|This 1971 album was the fourth by Alice Cooper (Warner Bros. BS 2567) and, in addition to being generally well-received by the critics, was a commercial success as well, reaching # 21 on the Billboard Album charts and producing two charted singles.<br /><br />The first was Under My Wheels which climbed to # 59 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late 1971/early 1972 on Warner 7529. The B-side, Desperado (also in the album), was first claimed by Cooper in an interview to have been written with the character Lee in mind from the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven, played by Robert Vaughn. But later, in liner notes from the 1997 live album, Fistful Of Alice, he then claims to have written it about his close friend Jim Morrison of The Doors who had passed away in Paris the year Killer was released.<br /><br />In March/April 1972, Be My Lover did marginally better, reaching # 49 Hot 100 on Warner 7568 b/w Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (also from the album). Controversy at the time was never far away from Cooper and the song Dead Babies had some up in arms, clearly people who had it in for Cooper and his \\"image\\" and so had a knee-jerk reaction to the title without bothering to listen to the tune, which delivers an unmistakable anti-child abuse message.<br /><br />Backing Alice (who also plays harmonica), are lead guitarist Glen Buxton, rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Bruce, bass guitarist Dennis Dunaway, keyboardist Bob Ezrin, and drummer Neal Smith. Rick Derringer adds another guitar in Under My Wheels.<br /><br />Produced by Bob Ezrin for Nimbus 9 Productions, Ltd., the tracks (writers shown in brackets) are:<br />Side One<br />1. Under My Wheels (Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, Bob Ezrin) - 2:50<br />2. Be My Lover (Michael Bruce) - 3:15<br />3. Halo Of Flies (Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michaelk Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, Neal Smith) - 8:21<br />4. Desperado (Alice Cooper, Michael Bruce) - 3:25<br />Side Two<br />1. You Drive Me Nervous\\" (Alice Cooper, Michael Bruce, Bob Ezrin) - 2:24<br />2. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (Alice Cooper, Michael Bruce) - 3:33<br />3. Dead Babies (Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, Neal Smith) - 5:40<br />4. Killer (Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway) - 7:07ah, Yeah, Yeah (Alice Cooper, Michael Bruce) - 3:33<br />3.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Having read very few books in my 38 years I was sceptical about it. Within the 1st chapter I was sucked in. I read all 3 books within 2 weeks. This book along with the others have inspired me to start a new hobby. I've read several since but all are pale in comparison. Take it from me, if there is one series to read, this is IT!
B00455UDP8|5.0|Released in September 1970, with a fluid mix of jazz, blues, rock and salsa, this was the second studio album by the rock band Santana (Columbia 30130), some 16 months following their initial LP \\"Santana\\" in May 1969. Of Greek origin, ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ or  \\"Abraxas\\" is a word often found in Gnostic cosmology (see The Holy Book Of The Great Invisible Spirit) with the 7 letters representing the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The back cover contains this quotation from the Hermann Hesse novel DEMIAN \\"We stood before it and began to freeze inside from the exertion. We questioned the painting, berated it, made love to it, prayed to it: We called it mother, called it whore and slut, called it our beloved, called it Abraxas....\\"<br /><br />The album cover depicts Mati Klarwein's 1961 painting Annunciation. Born April 9, 1932 in Hamburg, Germany (died March 7, 2002), he was two when he and his family relocated to the then British Mandate of Palestine following Hitler's rise to power in 1934. His paintings are now quite valuable.<br /><br />The primary band for this album has Carlos Santana (who also produced the LP) at lead guitar and backing vocals, keyboardist and lead vocalist Gregg Rolie, bassist David Brown, percussionists Jos&eacute; \\"Chepito\\" Areas (also conga and timbales - a shallow single-headed Cuban drum) and Mike Carabello (also conga), and drummer Michael Shrieve. Backing musicians are: percussionist Rico Reyes (also backing vocals); Steven Saphore on the tabla (an Indian drum), and on Incident At Neshabur, pianist Alberto Gianquinto.<br /><br />Two hit singles emerged from the album, the first being Black Magic Woman, first done by Fleetwood Mac in their 1968 English Rose album, which reached # 4 Billboard Pop Hot 100 and # 29 Adult Contemporary (AC) in late 1970/early 1971 in a 3:16 version (the album cut is 5:17) b/w Hope You're Feeling Better, also from the album, on Columbia 45270. Then, in February 1971, Oye Como Va began its climb to # 11 AC, # 13 Hot 100 and # 32 R&B in a 2:59 version (the album cut is 4:17) on Columbia 45330 b/w Samba Pa Ti. The album itself made it to # 1 on Billboard's album charts in late 1970 and eventually became aq five-time platinum disc.<br /><br />The tracks (with writers in brackets) are:<br />Side One<br />1. Singing Winds, Crying Beasts (Mike Carabello) - 4:48<br />2. Black Magic Woman (P. Green, G. Szabo) - 5:17<br />3. Oye Como Va (Tito Puente) - 4:17<br />4. Incident At Neshabur (Albert Gianquinto, Carlos Santana) - 4:58<br />Side Two<br />1. Se A Cabo (J.

Samba Pa Ti (Carlos Santana) - 4:46<br />4. Hope You'reFeeling Better (Gregg Rolie) - 4:10<br />5. El Nicoya (J.

In 1998, Sony again delivered a remastered CD that offers the three \\"live\\" cuts from a concert at Britain's Royal Albert Hall on April 18, 1970 but never before released: Se A Cabo, Toussaint L'Overture, and Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen. ll on April 18, 1970.

B000MM0GPA|5.0|When I ordered this I thought I was getting the U.S.Blu Ray Release(THAT IS MY FAULT,I should look at the product before I purchase it).I am SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT but it is different than the one I had(Mine got stolen).There are more language choices on this BLU Ray.The way I see it this is  the UK version of the film.(UNITED KINGDOM).This movie is superior to \\"QUANTOM  OF SOLACE\\". To me Daniel Craig is a much better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.I work out at URBAN ACTIVE GYM and I can appreciate the work of the stuntmen in this movie.It is nice to see Bond is a human being who bleeds blood when he is in a fight and gets bruises on his body after a fight.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great factory Nikon flash as an inexpensive upgrade over the built in one for my D3100 Nikon SLR camera.  I have used this for months now, and the tilting bulb feature is nice for indirect light for indoor portraits.  I have also used it at the Smithsonian Institute and Air and Space Museum where using this flash resulted in only need a small amount of photo software brightening to get the images up to snuff. This is a good choice for an add on flash on a budget.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Great movie! Looking forward to a second one.  A long running series wouldn't be a bad idea.  I really enjoy this type of movies and can watch them over and over again.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I was excited to download this app on my Kindle! It keeps crashing &amp; freezing. I click on a page then try &amp; go back to the pin &amp; all I get is a black page. I have this on my iphone &amp; it works fine. ugh!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Slow moving and not that good.  When your 70% through the book and Reacher hasn't hit anyone yet you know it's got problems. Very disappointed.
0529064847|5.0|This is a great study bible. As you read scripture it has many references on each page to enhance understanding. I purchased a copy for my father who is always asking me what the church teaches, so he could use this bible along with the catechism and gain a better understanding of the catholic faith.
B0086700CM|4.0|I always tell myself I'll play one game sure enough it's 10 min later and I'm on my 5th try. It is fun for all ages, the rules are simple and game keeps you on your toes you never know what's coming up next. All around a fun game.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Just because the ending is anti-climatic doesn't make this a bad movie. You want dramatic endings, then you do need to look elsewhere, but this is like life. I was really surprised it didn't have a higher rating. I think this movie should be shown in school to all children to really get a feeling for what 9/11 was REALLY like. My son said it best when he came home from kindergarten that day. \\"MOMMY! Two planes crashed into the buildings and the whole city fell down!\\" More like the whole country...
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this on my kindle fire. entertainment everywhere I go. my hubby and I both use it daily and my kids can even use it because its so User friendly.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I give this two stars instead of one based on Charlize Theron's performance. She was the one light in this boring poorly written snore fest of a movie. I am very glad that I did not pay to see this at the movies. Reading the reviews I thought the blasting of Kristen Stewart was just mad Twilight fans who wanted to get back at her for cheating. Turns out Kristen is just about the worst actor I've ever seen. Even given the weak script her performance brought the movie to a new low. The speech she gave near the end of the movie was so badly delivered it had me and my 14 yr old daughter laughing. My wife, always the smart one, had already given up on the movie and left the room to do something more interesting with her time. I feel like this could have been such a good movie that just missed the mark.
B000002GBB|5.0|I used to own this album on vinyl so I bought it on cd so I can enjoy it again this is one of there best albums along with the Grand Illusion, Cornerstone, and Paradise Theater.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I tried this app to download full episodes of shows I can't catch during the day but my kindle battery drained fast.
B003LL3NOK|3.0|Survival of the Dead follows a group of AWOL National Guardsmen as they make their way to Plum Island where two feuding families sort out the best way to deal with the living dead. The O'Flynns approach the zombie problem with a shoot-to-kill attitude. The Muldoons feel that the zombies should be quarantined, in hopes that a solution will be discovered. Whose side do you think the Guardsmen will choose? That's the plot to this film by George A. Romero.<br /><br />Let me state that I really admire the fact that Romero is trying something new with this movie by making it in the vein of such movies as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead & Zombie Dearest. Although, personally, I think the movie might have faired better if it were in a more serious tone(like his other movies). Fans are probably going to wonder what possessed Romero to make Survival the way he did(I know I asked that very question). I'm sure he had his reasons.<br /><br />Watching the movie, I realized almost right away that this movie was made on a much lower budget than his past movies. Look at the makeup effects on the zombies, there's hardly any at all. Not only that but the CGI this film has looks amatuerish. Like another reviewer here mentioned: \\"Survival comes across like a straight-to-video or made-for-SyFy movie.\\" That's not what us fans expect from Romero.<br /><br />Out of all Romero's movies, I figure Survival of the Dead will probably be the least liked by all his fans. Course, Romero fans owe it to themselves to see this movie. It's not a bad movie nor is it a good movie. It's an okay movie. That's alright by me, though, as there is far worse out there.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book will grab you from the start and not disappoint through the end. It is written so well you will feel like its a true story!
B004X2M3SI|2.0|I LOVE Doctor Who and am a member of Amazon Prime as I use a Roku box at home. This show was part of the reason I became a Prime Member and now only a few episodes are available through Prime so I have to pay extra to watch these episodes. I love Amazon and have been a customer for many years but am very frustrated by this. When you pay a yearly subscription for a product you don't want to get blind-sided by additional fees for the same product after only a short period of time. I can see (maybe) paying the fee for the newer episodes (Even though Hulu doesn't do that) but not the older ones! I love this show and I can't be alone in this and want Doctor Who back on Prime!
B002RAREAK|4.0|The CD case fell apart but this can happen on a new cd. It was also cracked. Not a big deal. The CD itself was perfect!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Fantastic novel. The pacing was excellent, very few spots where I caught myself skimming over unnecessarily florid description. The writing and plot were quite good and I don't remember once being pulled out of the story by poor plotting or writing. I'm eagerly looking forward to subsequent volumes.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is addicting because the challenge is based on your records. The upgrades are pretty fun and comical to keep you interested. And it runs well most of the time. Sometimes it will freeze for a short period, but overall it is a solid app. Droid Bionic.
B005P58PIO|5.0|A must see if you like action shows.I like this show so much I named my car after it...lol. Can't wait for season 3.
0425263908|3.0|Well, like most people I purchased this book because I was craving for a book similar to FSOG. Be careful what you ask for!!  This book was such a rip off of FSOG it is shameful.  Sylvia Day should be ashamed.  I had to fight the urge to stop reading the book.  Don't get me wrong, if you HAVE NOT read FSOG you will probably like this book.<br /><br />Gideon cannot hold a candle to Christen in my opinion by the way.  I did like Eva more than Ana though.  Eva was not as annoying as Ana...and Eva did not have an \\"inner goddess\\" thank goodness for that!!  I was in no way drawn to the charters in \\"Bare to You\\" like Ana and Christen.  I loved all the character in FSOG...except Mrs. Robinson of course.  The only character I really liked in \\"Bare to You\\" was Carey...Eva's bisexual best friend.<br /><br />The writing and sex scenes were better in \\"Bare to You\\" but I just did not connect with the plot or the characters.  Gideon was abused but we don't know how or by whom.  Eva was abused as well by her step brother.  I am curious about what happens to the couple so I will be reading the sequel.  Did I mention this will be a trilogy...again like FSOG.  Give me a break.
B006M6NUBC|4.0|I find it helpful to be able to access movies without having to wait for them to be presented by my On Demand provider.  Accessing the movie was easy and fast, and the cost was reasonable.
0307592731|5.0|Loved this book, and totally a great read for men and women alike. Cheryl hikes the PCT, Pacific Coast Trail, alone for most of it and learns who she is and what she is made of. A coming of age story....beautiful prose and uplifting, learned from it, heartwarming....a fantastic read and it's no wonder it is so popular.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app! The best part is, no mess on my table or dropping pieces on the floor! So addictive!
B007ZI06FE|3.0|The people you see on the cover are not in the book.  The woman in the book is dirt poor, exhausted, rail thin, due to starvation and has dark circles under her eyes, not to mention her very proper and modest way of dressing and behaving.  He seems older and rougher.  So don't judge this book by its cover.  Started slow...got better...started getting dragged out a bit...sex and use of the word \\"abraded\\" over and over again...the ending.  I liked the characters and I liked the story line but too much teasing and talking about not frightening the lead female character with his rough ways.  She couldn't sort out her feelings for the hunk, due to her past, but once she figured things out her skirts went up and, if it was up to her, they would have stayed there.  There's no sex, then there is a solid block of sex, and then there is the ending.  She is tough and loyal.  He is dangerous and kind.  They both have trust issues...which are resolved. Her siblings are nice and interesting.  His men, and those who work for him, are dedicated and willing to die for him.  I liked parts of it but don't think I will be buying the sequel.  I hope all of their abraded skin heals quickly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so cool I just play it all the time my high score is 3,127 I play this game all the time and I mean all the time u should get this cuz I'm sure u will like it if u don't well then u are stupid!!!!!!!!
B007ANGYV4|3.0|I guess this book falls into middle ground of sports autobiographies, not boring or dreary, not exactly a well written work of art either. Zlatan had a good story and the ghost writer does a good job of letting the true zlatan come across....and the true zlatan is such an unbelievablely self absorbed nutcase it makes for an enjoyable enough read
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like that it doesn't have a lot to remember or figure out. It's a simple way to pass time.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|If you are a fan of ZZ Top you will love this album.  If you are not already a fan, listen to this to find out why you should be!
034580404X|5.0|Although many parts of it are beyond unbelievable, there many many more parts worth reading and leave your jaw hanging open. Great book. Currently reading the second volume and I cannot put it down. Sneaking it to work today to read it..:)
0439023513|1.0|After enjoying the first two books in the series, I don't even have the words to describe how much I hated this book (or at least the last fifth of it).  I feel very set up by the author -- if I had any idea where she was going with this story, I wouldn't have read any of the books in the series. In fact, the dvd of the Hunger Games movie just came yesterday, and now I don't even want to watch it. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was more life affirming.  At least I know better than to ever read anything by this author again.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Mesnerizing and stunningly written. Captures the imagination and draws the reader into a world that is unimaginable.  Cannot put it down!
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|I am not a big fan of sci-fi movies, so I waited until recently, more than 10 years after this movie came out, to watch it. Now I wish I had watched<br />it earlier. The the special effect it creates, the story, the characters, the acting of Keanu Reeves, all of these made this classic movie on top of my<br />favorite lists. I will definitely put it into my collection and watch it again later. And I will go to watch the Matrix Revolutions too.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is pretty good, especially for the price. I don't play it a lot, mostly bought it for my grandchildren to play when they are antsy.
1476712042|2.0|I finished the book but it wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped.  I have been reading paranormal romance novels for a couple of years and these modern ones are just missing something for me.  I started my deviation with 50 Shades Trilogy and then Bared to You by Sylvia Day.  What I did like about this book is that it wasn't happy happy all the time.  But on the other hand it was just annoying as both of the characters were so clueless.  Was I ever this young and naive?!?  I think I just have too many years under my belt and I want to be transported to another place.  This was too rooted in the stupidity of youth.  The sex was scarce so I couldn't even rely on a guilty pleasure.  The OCD in me will make me read the book from Travis' perspective.  I am doing it under duress.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it functions very well on the kindle fire and I love that the numbers are big and easy to use.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This DVD completed my collection of Harry Potter, now I have the complete collection of both books and DVDs, so now I'm done.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I was skeptical to buy this movie after reading some reviews but I'm so glad I did.  I'm currently 30 weeks pregnant with child #3 myself and I found this movie to be funny, emotional, uplifting, and right on.  My husband wathced it with me and said \\"even if I wasn't a parent this movie is funny!\\"  I just loved it.  We had some great laughs and a myself a couple of tears.  Go get it!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I thought this was a fun read. Needed something to bring to the cottage and this was the perfect book.  Good biography with the humour you would expect from Tina Fey.  Was a bit disappointed in the way it abruptly ended but would recommend this book, especially to women.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game.  It has hidden objects plus a good mystery story.  Also finally a hint option that actually gives you the hints you need.  Hope to see more games like this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is like Mario. it is so awesome. there is also a game called monster galaxy. it is like pokemon. I reccomend getting this and monster galaxy.
B003H6KRIE|3.0|I really like the movies, and the sound track. The audio codec's are great but Bourne Identity does not play on my Sony BDP-590. The Bourne Identity freezes up the machine to the point that I have to unplug it and wait for a few seconds and then plug it back in to get the player unfrozen. The other movies play great, but with this issue I'm going to research and see if there is another release. I don't say if other BD players are having the same issue, but after two sets I'm done for now.<br /><br />Over all I was really dissapointed that the Bourne Identity stopped at the same place in both box sets, and had to return them both, but I'm giving the set three stars because of the way Amazon handled the issue by issuing a full refund with paid UPS pick up.
0345803485|5.0|I seriously cant understand the less than great reviews[WTH?] This triology of books was soooo freakin good. I absolutely could not put it down. It was HOT & SENSUAL. I even got my husband to read it[reignited the flames;-)] It turns out to be an erotic love story involving passionate yet KINKY sex. It was less BDSM & more catered around her pleasure.  If you like plain old missionary then this book is probably not for you. But if you're more risque & have an open mind then you would definitely enjoy this book!!!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|In the first one, we meet Layken, who has recently lost her father and moved far from home with her mother and younger brother. She meets her neighbor Will Cooper and the mutual attraction is instant. However, she soon finds out he's her teacher and chaos ensues. The story touches on themes of ethics, friendship, love, and family, as well as loss and grief.<br /><br />This one took me a little bit by surprise. I LOVED it. I holed myself up in my bedroom, under the covers, and tore through it in a day. Layken is a smart heroine and her voice is very strong. Will is basically the perfect guy and almost too good to be true, but obviously the situation he and Layken find themselves in makes everything more complicated. The secondary characters are purposeful and add a lot of depth. I especially loved Eddie - very unique and humorous. The romance between Layken and Will, as it changed and grew as they encountered various obstacles, was very realistic and I really believed they loved each other. I did feel the whole situation - guy drops out of college to be guardian for much younger brother when parents die - was a little farfetched, but it made for good entertainment. Hoover is a thoughtful writer and kept the story moving and flowing well.<br /><br />The themes here are more mature than many other contemporary YA books available now and I appreciated Hoover not shying away from them. I am sure there are a lot of readers who are dealing with the death of a parent or loved one who can really relate to how Layken and Will are feeling and perhaps this story might help someone cope better. I also love that the idea of slam poetry (which seems a little 1990's to me - do people really still do it?) is promoting self-expression and catharsis. Working with adolescents in my day job, I can't tell you how many kids hold stuff in to the point that is manifests itself in cutting, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, etc. so anything that shows good examples of healthy coping techniques is thumbs up in my book.<br /><br />4/5(
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is addicting and wonderful. its awesome really keeps you wanting more. you'll never stop wanting to play it. shoots Im having a hard time going to sleep
B007Y1JGOY|5.0|What an incredible album. With this album M. Westerholt and his band are now on a par with brother Robert's Within Temptation. I love it and haven't played anything else since I received it. Buy it, you'll love it.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|Gotta say this thing is a good product.  I had a simple bumper on the fire since I got it at launch.  The kids were buggin me to get one that held it up so they could watch movies on the plane/resturants (I know I am not going to win a parenting award, but silence is golden).  Anyway it works as advertised and looks cool, also covers the screen. I must disclose that I have never put a protector on the screen and it still looks great and we chuck it in all our bags.  I got white so it would be easy to pick the kindle out on a table or somewhere when it was laying around.  High visibility and sleek look all in one.  Enjoy if you get your own.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this one of the best ones out there. its has all translation needed. and book mark is life savor.<br />all i can say is i love it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is my &quot;go-to&quot; game whenever I want to unwind for a few minutes. You can somewhat control the level of the challenge by going to settings and choosing how many suits of cards you play with. I  usually play with two suits because it allows me to &quot;win&quot; often enough to keep me playing but not so often that it gets &quot;boring&quot;.  Spider doesn't require a lot of mental input which makes it a great game to play while watching TV or sitting in a waiting room.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game, very addicting. Slight pauses will make you eat a tree once in awhile But worth getting especially since its free.
B001PJ1QF8|5.0|This was the first 8 track tape I bought for my car after graduation. I've been a fan a very long time. I still enjoy the music today. It brings back many wonderful memories of my youth. I have downloaded it to my mp3 so I can listen when working out or doing yard work. I also listen to it when working on my computer. I hope to soon get more of his music that I enjoy so much. Thanks JT!
B0069UP2PI|4.0|I watched Contagion with my wife and we both agreed that Steven Soderbergh has an eye for pretty women.  Four of them star in the movie in question, but we watched in dismay as two of them wound up grotesquely disfigured and abused.  One of them winds up with the skin pulled right off her face a la a memorable horror scene in the 1991 Michele Soavi import La Setta, produced by Dario Argento.  I don't want to spoil any surprises so I won't tell you who's who, but another beautiful woman winds up kidnapped and forced to teach Chinese schoolchildren in a remote province of China, and yet she manages to stay as drop dead gorgeous and coiffed as if she had Anouk Aimee's hairdresser combing her up after every class.  I never did figure that one out, but the implication, my wife said, is that she didn't really mind being taken hostage at all; we thought maybe she had fallen for her principal captor, or at any rate she believed him when he said he wanted only health for his village and would seize it by any means necessary.  She had beautiful sweaters and pearls, for a schoolteacher but that made sense, because she was actually not a teacher at all but a--u oh, mustn't say, that would be a giveaway about which of Soderbergh's four stars it was.  Three pf them are Oscar winners, and the one who isn't should have won for this!<br /><br />Did Matt Damon and Jude Law win any Oscars?  Weren't they in love in the Talented Mr. Ripley a few years back.  Now they look considerably past their prime, but wouldn't you, if one of you was a blogger with a fierce conviction that the common forsythia, like the bush my grandma used to have in her side yard, could cure the outbreak, stop it cold, only the Center for Disease in Control in Atlanta wasn't letting the truth be known, and the other of you was this glum mournful widower who has to put on his own prom for his teenage daughter because of the quarantine?  I won't say which is which, but let me tell you, there were many creepy scenes but none sop creepy as our widower trying to turn his living room into Prom Night with yards and yards of white stain ribbon and a weird prom gown delivered in a plastic bag.  My wife and I were surprised to find that he wasn't supposed to be unnaturally involved with his daughter, it was just supposed to be a cute thing he was doing to make her feel better about the disease ravaging Minneapolis.  I have to say that the movie was filled with surprises and I felt that the blog thing was right up to the minute two years ago or whenever this movie came out.but none sop creepy as our widower trying to turn his living room into Prom Night with yards and yards of white stain ribbon and a weird prom gown delivered in a plastic bag.

0525953728|3.0|I haven't actually read the book yet though I intend to do. This score is meant to be a balanced one. The reason I'm weighing in is because this has seemingly become a forum on the moral issues surrounding this book.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that I'm not American but British. I love America and its people (unless you're an airport passport control officer - in which case you can kiss my a**). Most Americans I've met are warm and friendly.<br /><br />I completely understand the code of silence that exists within the military and some are rightfully angered that Matt Bissionette has broken this by speaking out so soon. However, I'm afraid I have to support Matt here by saying that if anyone has broken the `code', it is Obama and his administration. Normally, whenever a Spec Forces Op makes the news, it was conducted by `US Special Forces'. Considering the US has so many Spec Forces Units it could be any. But within hours of the Bin Laden mission, it was `outed' to the media that SEAL TEAM 6 or DEVGRU or whatever you want to call them were behind the op. The admission came from Obama himself. That's unprecedented considering the US Government continually insists that DEVGRU and DELTA `don't officially exist'!<br /><br />In the UK, our government has a policy of not commenting on Special Forces. The media gets their stories from moles in the MoD and former SAS/SBS members. You've never heard the Prime Minister publicly say the SAS conducted that mission, top job. No, it was Obama who put the spotlight on Team 6, constant leaks coming out of the Pentagon about the new prototype helicopter that crashed, how the operation unfolded, who did what and when. Then you had the news that Kathryn Bigelow was doing a movie about the op and the team with the full co-operation from the government, originally supposed to come out within the next few months. Have people forgotten this already? I remember Obama's speech where he talked about `I did this' and `I decided that'. I was expecting him to finish with `and I personally blew Bin Laden away on behalf of all Americans'. One of the British TV channels did a documentary on the mission and senior levels within Obama's administration gave personal interviews including Obama himself. It's all there on Youtube.<br /><br />Let's face it somebody was going to write a book detailing the mission. You can bet that when Obama leaves office, his memoirs will be full of what happened in Pakistan. It may as well be someone who was actually there who wrote about it first despite his beef with the SEAL's. If anybody has betrayed the US military and is leaking secretive information, it's the President himself, not the foot soldiers.

0385495323|4.0|I am an avid reader of books on military history and this book had been on my wish list for a while. When I finally got my hands on it, it certainly did not disappoint.<br />Intelligence (in the military sense and otherwise) or the lack of it has determined the course of wars and the fate of many lives for centuries. Espionage has been the glamorous arm of intelligence gathering, but cryptography has been the backbone on which nations have conducted their military operations and the fundamental building block of the digital world in which nations, corporations and individuals operate today.<br />Cryptology has always been a battle between those who encode (cryptographers) and those who try to break the code (cryptoanalysts).This books traces the evolution of cryptography from the times of Mary of Scot (who was executed as her communication was intercepted and deciphered, proving that she was plotting to assassinate the English Queen), through substitution ciphers  in the 19th and 20th centuries and how they were finally broken in the Arab world to modern times and the impact of Enigma on the outcome of WWII and finally the current use of RSA encryption and cutting edge quantum cryptography.<br />I would recommend this book to only those genuinely interested in this topic as it requires a certain amount of concentration and effort to understand how the various encryptions work and how ingenious the logic to break those codes is. Without that effort, the beauty of the code and its break is lost on the reader.<br />Recommended to those genuinely interested in cryptography and military history.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very clever piece of writing, highly enjoyed this novel, even though thrillers are not my genre at all. Gillian Flynn is a skilled author, no doubt about it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This is the most evil and corrupt piece of trash I ever read. It demoralized gays and women. It talks about some piece of crap named god who seems like a jerk. Why would I let my child read this garbage. If this was a real book I would throw it in my fire place but instead I deleted and uninstalled. Definitely the worst faerie tale book ever.
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|The plot is generally good. Its fast paced, fun, good action. But there are a few places that simply don't makes sense. So the watcher has to suspend intelligence for the movie to make sense.

B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it because it was suggested for \\"people who liked Fifty Shades\\". There were parts of the story that were unbelievable and I had to just accept, but I must say that I liked it BETTER than Fifty! I can't wait to see where the story goes in the second book.
0062202081|1.0|I'm a fan of Justin Bieber, even going to his concert in NY this November... BUT... this book... I don't even know what to say. It sounds like it was written by a fifth grader. It's so repetitive and sounds so childish. I agree with the other review, he should go back to school. I just cracked it open, so I'm only on page 24 but there isn't a lot of content. This book is mostly pictures and all I've gotten from it thus far is... He works hard, believes and appreciates his fans and that's great, but is there anything else you have to say? No doubt he is a talented artist but no one said he was smart.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|After reading all the reviews of Lee Child's latest book, and seeing the kindle price I am opting out.  Perhaps I will read a library copy down the line or find it in a second hand store some day.  The Affair was not worth the money and I refuse to be caught again.  I think I'll go for a good Mexican dinner and forego \\" Wanted.\\"  I think perhaps Reacher has had his run.  The Enemy was my favorite.<br />A comment on my review saying I should read the book first was misleading.  I said I was not going to pay $13.00 for a kindle book I could not easily loan to a friend.  But I didn't say I wasn't going to read it.  I have read it and though it was a fun fast read I am glad I didn't buy it.  I read a friend's copy.  Books like this are a wonderful fun escape but way overpriced for what they are.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun but gets repetitive  towards the end of the game. worth the download and a great time kill puzzle app.
B000I52LUO|2.0|Wow.  I read the previous reviews and believed them.  BIG mistake.<br />This is the single most depressing movie I have ever seen.  Not EXACTLY predictable; I mean, the guy doesn't appear to be schizophrenic, but wow.  Just wow.  Awful, awful, awful.  No wonder it's free.  The only reason I give it two stars is because the acting is superb.  Please don't waste your time on this one.  Life can be depressing enough without this totally unnecessary addition.  BOOOOOOO!!!!

030758836X|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel and what a great read.  I loved the first person narrative with the husband and wife.  This type of writing is not done all that much and therefore I found it very interesting way of telling this two sided story.

B008PE9GSA|5.0|Here's the deal....if you bought the Best Buy Exclusive with the two bonus tracks (Threshold Of A Breakdown and Drive By Lover) you've got a 5 star album!  If you just bought the plain bones version with the ten tracks instead of twelve, you've got a three star event!  Yes...it's that much of a difference...the two extra tracks are that good!  I'm a big ZZ Top fan and I went with the extra tracks for the same price as the plain version...it's a no-brainer...isn't it?  There's my two bits worth for all you reading this!  Just saying!
B001EBV0P8|4.0|it is such a great movie that a have seen a hundred times and would see it a hundred more times.

B008ASLK8A|2.0|Acting was great.  The movie looked good, but didn't have any heart of emotion.  The action scenes looked good, but didn't draw you in.  Wish they had taken more time to develop this based on how well I liked the first one
0375842209|4.0|This is one of those stories that you read and savour, like a good meal. It's certainly not a quick read, but there is some very creative imagery and some powerful scenes and themes that stay with you long after you've closed the book. I liked the characterization of Death, the descriptions of the starkness of war-time life at a personal level (without being overly depressing), and the German common wo/man's perspective of war events. These were probably the most novel things for me because I hadn't read anything before that showed these perspectives of WWII. (Well, there was Anne Frank's Diary but I don't remember that being a gripping read, plus I read that many moons ago.)<br /><br />The first couple of pages takes some getting used to, as you try to figure out who is narrating and what the connections are between the parts, but the story evens out and there are long stretches where Death (the narrator) doesn't appear. I never really connected with the main character (Liesel, not Death), but it was hard not to sympathize with everything she and her community were going through. Not sure if this is really a YA novel because some of the events make more sense with a deeper background knowledge of the war. I have passed this book on to a friend because while it was a beautiful read, it's not a keeper.

B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie. The story speaks to every generation, for me it was a reflection not only of the Roman Empire, but made me think about the growing gulf in the United States today between the very rich and everyone else.  I loved the story so much I immediately purchased all three books and the DVD. I read the books after seeing the movie, and it really helped fill in the story. I would recommend the books to anyone who liked the movie. I applaud Suzanne Collins for her ability to create a world which can make young and old really think about our beliefs and our behavior.
B000002L9J|5.0|If you want proof that the 1980s didn't suck, look no further than here.<br /><br />At a time when synth-driven new wave, hair metal and Michael Jackson was all the rage, four delinquents from Manchester, England came together to form one of the greatest rock bands of all time. That band's name was the Smiths, an extraordinarily talented group which featured bassist Andy Rourke, drummer Mike Joyce, the immeasurable guitarist Johnny Marr and one of the rock's most original frontmen, Morrissey. They were a breath of fresh air in a world where synthesizers were the norm, where pop stars succeeded by looks and charities rather than their talents and prowess, where rock n' roll was put in the back-burner in exchange for glossy, cheesy pop hits. If anything, the Smiths helped bring guitar rock back to prominence, particularly in the U.K. where those that listened to the Smiths went on to become members of Radiohead, Oasis, Suede and Pulp.<br /><br />The Smiths were more than a great rock band; they were a great rock band that could write. In the span of four years, the Smiths crafted melodic pop singles and albums that dealt with unconventional topics like homosexuality (\\"Hand in Glove\\"), child molestation (\\"Surfer Little Children\\"), murder (\\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\"), adolescent sex (\\"What She Said\\", \\"Reel Around the Fountain\\", \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves\\"), education (\\"The Headmaster Ritual\\"), human conditions (\\"How Soon is Now?\\", \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\", \\"Girl Afraid\\", \\"Ask\\") and commercialism (\\"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\\", \\"Panic\\", \\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\\"). In short, they were a rock band that made pop songs filled with social and intellectual bite.<br /><br />They made excellent singles and phenomenal albums but unquestionably, their greatest achievement (and one of my personal favorites) by far is \\"The Queen is Dead\\" (1986). Simply put, if you love British rock music, particularly the 90s stuff, then you HAVE to own this album. There's so much greatness in this lean, tight 37-minute record that no matter how many times I listen to it, I always come out of it elated. I can happily go as far as saying that if I was stranded on a desert island with only a boombox at hand, THIS would be the album I'd take.<br /><br />Each song on \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is an instant classic with zero filler in sight. The ferocious opener \\"The Queen is Dead (Take Me Back to Dear Old Blightly) gets this album to a great start, opening with a snippet from a kitchen-sink drama before crashing into a louder, chaotic and frantic noise that recalls the apocalyptic imagery of The Clash's \\"London Calling\\". The next two songs are, by contrast, funnier and despairing with the jaunty \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\" and harrowing \\"I Know It's Over\\" respectively. \\"Never Had No One Ever\\", arguably the album's weakest track, is a slight, resonant song that helps serve as a relief from the thunderous three opening tracks. The first half finally concludes with the shimmering pop of \\"Cemetery Gates\\", a folk-rockish tale the mocks the notion of plagiarism and stealing one's material to form your own.<br /><br />But it's the second half that is the heart of the album. THIS is where the masterpieces really come into play. The kinetic rush of \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\", irresistible catchiness of \\"The Boy With the Thorn on His Side\\", melancholic beauty of \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" and wicked comedy of \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" are absolute classics; four affecting, effervescent pop songs where one can trace the roots of Britpop classics like Blur's \\"Chemical World\\", Oasis' \\"Wonderwall\\", Radiohead's \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and Pulp's \\"Common People\\". It's disappointing that the first two songs here didn't do well at the UK charts because they represent everything that was good about the Smiths at the time.<br /><br />Most British rock bands of the 1980s and 1990s were unable to achieve such commercial success in America due to the nature of their music, their chose of topics and America's general prejudice towards anything \\"British\\". But it is essential for any music lover to listen to \\"The Queen is Dead\\" (1986), even if they don't care about British rock music. This is a transcendent rock record which proves without a doubt that there was more to the Smiths than \\"How Soon is Now?\\" and \\"This Charming Man\\". \\"The Queen is Dead\\" (1986) is easily their best and most accessible record and it's a great start for anyone wanting to get into the band. It may even convert a naysayer into a life-long fan.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.ture of their music, their chose of topics and America's general prejudice towards anything \\"British\\".

1476712042|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours.  It's like crack - I could not put it down and I couldn't wait to get home from work and keep reading.  I cried for about a good hour in the middle but well worth it.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I'm giving five stars to all six seasons of Lost because I enjoyed every single episode. Sure, I enjoyed some more than others, but every episode provoked an emotional reaction: a laugh, misty eyes, or a surprised \\"wow.\\" The characters are sharply defined and the acting is uniformly strong. I can't think of another series in which I altered my opinion of the characters so frequently. Characters I disliked turned out to be admirable, while characters who initially seemed admirable turned out to be sketchy. My favorite character changed from week to week and, while watching one die was always upsetting, the feeling of loss was ameliorated by the rise of another.<br /><br />Unlike some naysayers who think a disappointing ending to the series destroys the value of each episode that preceded it, I'm not prepared to forget how frequently I was captivated, and moved, by the stories that were told about the individual lives of the island's inhabitants. And if I may be so bold as to disagree with those who think the writers of the series got \\"lost\\" along the way, it seems to me that the story follows a coherent arc. There are scenes in season one that attain no significance until season six. That reflects careful planning, not off-the-cuff writing.<br /><br />My sole gripe about Lost is that it incorporates a supernatural/mystical/religious element that, although central to the story, is not something to which I can easily relate. I'm not a big fan of the supernatural. It's just too easy to use the supernatural to explain phenomena when, with more difficulty and imagination, a reality-based explanation might be concocted. The \\"smoke monster\\" that turns up from time to time, the good versus evil theme, the deliberate confusion as to whether Jason or Locke might be the devil, all struck me as misplaced. The serious religious overtones of the final episode are just unnecessary. This could have been told as a time travel story with characters living parallel lives on and off the island without getting hokey about \\"what comes next.\\" The attempt to meld science fiction and mysticism almost never works, and the effort to do so in Lost weakens the overall story. Having said that, I reaffirm my belief that displeasure with the series' resolution does not change the immense pleasure I felt watching the individual episodes that led up to it.island without getting hokey about \\"what comes next.\\" The attempt to meld science fiction and mysticism almost never works, and the effort to do so in Lost weakens the overall story.

1455502758|5.0|Although not as far ranging as many of his other works, Mr. Hitchens delivers again with his humor and acute observation,  this time in a series of essays written during the time leading up to his death. While much of the material addressing his long held contentions regarding religion and god is old stuff, his portrayal of a person's experience with severe and terminal illness and the interaction with medical workers and friends is poignant and fresh.  I have considerable experience with people who have life threatening and imminently mortal diseases and I can attest to the truth of much of what he says though clearly from the opposite vantage point thus far.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who so afflicted as well as family members or close friends.<br /><br />Mr. Hitchens comments at one point in this book and it has been said elsewhere that his writing style conveys a sense that he is speaking directly to the reader.  I think this is not quite it, but rather I think his writing inculcates in the reader a desire to learn the same stuff and see if one comes up with the same conclusions.  The number of books on one's list always grows while reading his writing, and I think it is this that accounts for his popularity even among those who strongly disagree with him, among whom I count myself on some issues.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although I do not read much,  I found this series to be one that I could not put down. If you were to get just the first one then you would have to get the second, then the third and then you would end up getting all of them anyways. Constant propelling story from the begining to the end.  I have never reviewed a book before, but Hugh Howey has it going on in this one. I will have to get the next ones in the Wool collection if they come out. It is science fiction, but it is not so far out there that it is not capable of happening and to me symbolizes our government now. A MUST QUICK READ.

I have always been a Vampire fan and I wanted to own the whole series on DVD. Now that season 5 had concluded I have decided to review the entire series season by season. If you like Vampires buy True Blood and get own copies of this series.
B0019GJ4EM|5.0|I'm sick and tired of Amazon lumping DVD reviews together with Bluray reviews. This gets really annoying when I'm trying to learn about improvements made for a Bluray release. And now we have 2 different Bluray options for this movie, Escape From New York. One is a combo pack from MGM and is $15 and change and the other is from Canalstudio, priced about $10 higher. What am I supposed to do? Which one looks better? Which one has the correct aspect ratio? Amazon (I have read) has the wrong aspect ratio listed on one of these releases making this problem even worse! Which one has more bonus features? Does either of these releases have the deleted scene included in the deluxe 2 disc DVD? ARE YOU LISTENING AMAZON? I know someone has to check this review for curse words, unless they have an automated system doing that.<br /><br />Also, how about listing the bonus features for every movie? All you have to do is read the back of the cover and enter the information.<br /><br />Amazon is still my favorite place to shop. They have the biggest selection, and with Amazon Prime I get free 2 day shipping. But the problems I have mentioned is really making my life difficult.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, my 5 star rating is for this movie. It is one of my all-time favorites, in any format. As far as which edition you should buy, well, good luck. Amazon has left it to be a guessing game.

B008H5J510|1.0|This movie definitely depicts the life of Katy Perry and her rising fame with fun clips and cool scenes but fails to deliver a real meaning and glorious emotional feel. It's like your watching a movie for little kids except it's about a 28 year old woman singing about \\"Peacocks\\" and her \\"Teenage Dreams\\". Music/Tour documentaries are for Justin Bieber not Katy Perry. Can't stand this movie can't stand her. Not to mention that this movie failed to do good in any countries, but too bad for her. Seems her stunt to gain in cash didn't work because her fan base isn't big enough for that. As far as my personal opinion of Katy I think she is a cool and fun WOMAN, but is way too cheery, sweet, and bubble gum pop. Her music feels so fake, and her vocal talent and Musical talent isn't necessarily the best. She did not help produce, direct, or manage anything for this movie, which really shows the work she put in? RIGHT? She has done good for her self, but I feel when her next album comes out she wont be so happy? Perfume?Movie?ReRelease?Soda?Chips?VideoGames? It seems shell do anything to be in the spotlight but lacks that mature and true feeling to her. She does not have the presence of a legend but just another singer, a bad one that is.<br />Sorry for all my blabbering, I know this is a review of her movie not herself but I feel I need to include it as well so yes that's it!<br />Thank you!
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Let me first say: I can not stand Kristen Stewart. I have tried to re-watch the the Twilight Saga for the want to like the movies, since Vamp movies are fun. I have tried, and failed. Stewart is probably the most annoying actor in recent history, and beats DeCaprio for award of \\"Whiny Actors in Movies, portraying a serious role\\". With that said, I had debated watching this film, and the reviews were not in it's favor...at all. With that being said:<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the movie, a lot. The Evil Queen was spectacular, the fight scenes were excellent and the concept of the overall movie was well thought out. I read reviews stating the action scenes weren't exciting enough, or long enough. I disagree. It is not \\"300\\", but it doesn't need to be, there is actually a good script and great filming. The fight scenes were well choreographed and shot. Long enough to be fun, but not annoying with undue filler to waste film time. Thankfully Stewart does not have a lot of lines, and that makes her role great. The lines shes has are OK, and yes, her little rousing speech is pretty strained feeling and not very well approached, filmed or executed, but its a small part of the film. I felt she actually portrayed her character, as written, really well. I would never call this movie Snow White in respect to following the commonly conceived notion of Snow White. Except for the dwarves and the Magic Mirror though. Think Snow White, alternate universe to Disney where Snow White is a vigilante EMO girl.<br /><br />The mixing of a couple fairy tales into to movie was fun. Expect a cool troll scene and the dwarves and the forest scenes were fun and really well done.<br /><br />I liked it and even my wife liked it. I would let my 3 yo old watch the forest scenes just for the beauty, but cant because of the content and language.<br /><br />So, overall, to all you people who can not stand Stewart in her Sage movies, give it a chance. I think you'll like it. I did.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't wait to start the third book. Written so that you can't wait to see what happens next. I am recommending it to all of my friends. Anxious to see the  movie version:)
0525953728|5.0|I don't really like to read that much but this book is only one of 3 books that I have read so quickly...The Gift of Valor and Flags of Our Fathers also kept me reading. With that said, I loved this book. It is a very exciting and interesting look into a man's life as a Navy SEAL. I enjoyed reading about all of his other missions and of course the raid on Bin Laden is very exciting but I especially liked that he is a very humble man and that he shared a little bit of himself personally. I have always been curious as to how these men \\"come down\\" and go back to normal after a mission, especially something as big as this one. My husband was a Marine for 6 years and had a couple of combat deployments to Iraq. Those deployments changed him. I always asked him if he was doing ok when he came home and I remember how he told me it's like you are on a constant adrenaline rush when you are there...always moving, always working, always alert and you do that for 7 months or so. Then, when you come back home you have to \\"come down\\". It's a struggle for some people. I like that the author talks about that adrenaline rush he would get while on missions. He is a professional. It isn't just about going out at night and killing people or capturing people. He describes in detail exactly what happened from the time the OBL mission was being planned and the training they did beforehand to the mission itself to all the work that they had to perform after the mission was over. He also describes his emotions throughout it all. I had no idea that when these missions are over the SEALs still have so much work they have to do! I remember thinking while I was reading near the end, after the mission had been successful, \\" that poor guy...is he ever gonna get to sleep?!\\" But they know it's part of their job and he seemed to love his job and we have that to be thankful to him for.
034580404X|5.0|Well these books are an excellent read! The first book I could not put down and was very interesting! The second book was ok but not as good as the first.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|I love this app, everything is easy to use and never had any major problems. The one thing i found is when selling an item and changing to no international shipping. When changed and saved it always goes back to same rate to all buyers. So im always getting emails and bids from other countries. Even when i say shipping to lower 48 states only in the description. Just an annoying thing that needs fixed.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Normally the second book in a series cannot even compare to the first book, but this is clearly not the case in this trilogy. You will continue to be shocked by the unbelievable events that continue to occur, and you won't be able to put this book down. :)
B00004YZFR|5.0|As time goes by I realize what a strange era the late 1960's was. Woodstock was over and the nomadic hoards of rock and rollers had become very wild, restless and edgy. A time when it seemed like a good idea to have the Hell's Angels as your security. This documentary of the December 1969 Altamont Speedway concert By The Rolling Stones, Jefferson Airplane and other bands is so fascinating by not only recording  Mick Jagger And the Rolling Stones at their prime but also the chaos and foiled murder attempt on Jagger. The images of Hell's Angels roaming the stage, pummeling audience with pool cues, tossing madmen back into the audience and actually saving Jagger's life by stabbing a gunman seconds before he would shoot him. The images of faces of lost souls, some hateful, some in ecstasy, but most looking sorry and some crying. But above all, I think its the image of Mick Jagger trying to perform in the epicenter of Hell, and for that I have sympathy for the devil.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I loved almost all of the songs on this album.  I loved the lyrics and the feel of the music as well as the sound of it.  And her voice is eerily catchy; can't put my finger on it, but I find myself wanting to go back and listen to it again and again.  Great stuff!

B0075LTOR2|5.0|Not much to add except I believe the term used for this set would be unmastered instead of remastered, as they took out whatever was added, leaving you with what it should have sounded like \\"Back in the day\\". If asked, I would say this is the closest you can get to the \\"BEST\\" listening experience (i.e. - 33rpm on a direct-drive turntable).<br /><br />If you have all of these, and various combinations of such, I'd probably just keep my money and listen to what I have.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|WOOL is a \\"dystopian\\" science fiction novel, meaning it's the same genre as classics like \\"On the Beach\\", Heinlein's Orphans of the Sky, A Canticle for Leibowitz and yes, the monster bestseller Hunger Games. So, if you like this genre (and you can tell, I do because I rattled off four right off the top of my head) then you will really LOVE \\"Wool.\\"<br /><br />Wool is set in what the reader is led to guess a post-nuclear or post-biological cataclysimic society. People live in The Silo, which is a vertical structure going down many levels all connected by a huge spiral staircase. There are segments, the bottom where the mechanics live (essentially the engine room of old steam ships), the hydroponic farm levels, the IT levels (who wield immense power) and finally the top levels, where the Sheriff and Mayor and the government resides. Fail to obey the extraordinarily restrictive rules? You are condemned to \\"cleaning\\", which is a job where you suit up in protective environmental suits, go outside the silo and clean off some sensors. The data from the swabbing of these sensors gives an idea if the outside has become less toxic or is still completely uninhabitable. The suits last only so long...it's a one-way assignment and despite the resentment and even sometimes arbitrary sentence to \\"clean\\", no one fails to do their duty at the last....until......<br /><br />This is a fast-moving novel, keeps you guessing, there are great \\"good\\" characters and a really excellent villain who has some potentially \\"good\\" intentions, which is the BEST kind of villain--not a cardboard boogeyman but a real man, with evil and good mixed in certain proportions.<br /><br />You will see elements of other fave sci-fi in this book (I detected some Silverberg, more than a little and yes, Grand Master Heinlein) but the voice of Hugh Howey is his own, clear, vibrant and he has a knack for crisp, exciting actions. My only criticism is one scene seemed to take too long (an underwater scene, will not give out spoilers!!!!) but except for that? READ IT!!!!e out spoilers!!!!) but except for that? READ IT!!!!

0920668372|1.0|This book seems not written for children but for mothers. It's one thing to give a child a book, another to actually love them. This one is disturbing because it suggests that there is an obligation for the child to take care of his mother when she gets older, that the unconditional love should be for the mother, regardless of how the child has been treated in real life. Unconditional love requires no reciprocity. It is given freely with no expectation of anything in return.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|reading Persuasion for me was dificult but i did cause i love Austen books. now watching this live and so very well acted, I´m totally transported to the book. its sweet and lovely.<br />I think its ver dificult the task  adaptating the book to a movie. but this its a Wonderfull adaptation. i love it, i get nervous, happpy and suffer with every thing that happend to this carracters.<br />then after i finish the movie, i go back to the book and then back to the movie.
B006PTL1QM|4.0|The movie is based on the book A Most Dangerous Method and the stage play The Talking Cure. It follows Carl Jung and details his relationship with Sigmund Freud and the development of psychoanalysis.<br /><br />It's not typically my type of movie, but I didn't get bored not one time (and that is super rare for me in something like this.) But here's why I liked it.<br /><br />The movie is complex. And I think the directors and actors handled the material very well. Michael Fassbender did a great job showing Jung's struggles to stick to own theories while feeling the pressure to conform to Freud's (played by Viggo Mortenson) \\"scientific\\" (and mostly sex-obsessed) approach to psychology.<br /><br />The movie starts in 1904 when Jung takes on the hysterical Sabina Speilrein, a Russian Jew (played oddly by Keira Knightly) and tries out Freud's new psychoanalytic theories on her. It works wonders and she not only makes vast improvements but grows up and becomes invested in the field herself.<br /><br />The rift between Freud and Jung start when Jung realizes that Freud will never see him as an equal, though Freud tries to spin it as disgust at Jung's affair with Sabina. It seemed to be Freud was threatened by Jung and tried to shut him up by saying that Jung's theories would ruin and discredit the field of psychology.<br /><br />I had a little bit of a hard time being convinced that Keira Knightly was Russian or a Jew. Her accent seemed a little inconsistent at times, but I think she did the best she could and that helped me look past it. The significance of Sabina & Freud being Jewish and Jung being a Swiss-Reformed Aryan is only slightly touched upon. I think they could have delved a little deeper into that, but the movie wanted to keep the majority of the focus on Jung's relationships with Freud & Sabina and also Jung's relationship with himself and how he goes from being a student of Freud's and doubting himself to being one the leading psychologists of his time.<br /><br />For me it was especially interesting to follow Jung as I didn't know nearly as much about him as I knew about Freud. I think this is worthwhile movie to watch for anyone interested in psychology.><br />For me it was especially interesting to follow Jung as I didn't know nearly as much about him as I knew about Freud.

B000PTYNI6|4.0|Three Imaginary Boys is the Cure's U.K. debut and for a band that has done so much that should be enough reason alone to buy this heavy, cleanly produced vinyl version. It is by no means quintessential or in any way a typical Cure album. Here you'll find the Cure searching for their sound with varying results and the second side does seem to fall away towards the end. However, the first side is great and has 10:15 Saturday night, Accuracy, Grinding Halt, Another Day, Object, and Subway Song which are all great. Side Two has Three Imaginary Boys and the excellent Fire In Cairo but also four other songs that are best described as decent stabs at late 70's power pop or punk. Nothing wrong with the songs as such but it can come across patchy if your used to the later version of the band. This is one of the reasons why I give the album 4 stars and not 5. The other drawback is that the hidden track The Weedy Burton is omitted on the Deluxe vinyl reissue which is a disappointment because the song is by no means a Cure classic but it would have been a better to leave it on in respect of the artists original intentions or out of historical correctness. Still it's very nice to have a new heavy vinyl version of the Cure's debut. It is a decent album.

0525953728|4.0|Okay let's get the obvious controversy out of the way. \\"Mark Owen\\" wrote a book about his experiences as a naval special warfare operator, a big no-no in the hush-hush spec ops community. There's a code of silence that is supposed to be followed and respected. I get that. He will probably be seen as an outcast among active duty and retired SEALs alike, and I'm sure he knew the repercussions writing this book would have and chose to do it anyway. That's his choice, let it be so.<br /><br />There's a lot of misinformation in general, and in other reviews, about this book.<br /><br />People claim he insults president Obama. He doesn't. At one point in the book he explains frustration at Obama and his administration taking credit for the Richard Phillips rescue from Somalian pirates, carried out by DEVGRU operators in 2009 (an operation Owen's team took part in). Later in the book he explains that a lot of his guys \\"aren't fans of Obama\\". Hey that's fair. You either like the guy or you don't, right? It's no secret a lot of hard core military guys tend to be on the conservative side. But this book isn't about politics, unless you count the handful of times he expresses his dismay at how Washington delays or outright refuses to green-light military operations, even after they've been planned and rehearsed. (Yes, even Tier One operators have to answer to Washington, they're not a bunch of gung-ho vigilantes with free reign). Reviewers claiming Mark Owens \\"trash talks the president\\" are desperate sensationalists looking for any small reason to lambast the author. There's maybe one page in the whole book, added up, that touches on this subject.<br /><br />Other reviewers claim this book exposes information that compromises operational and personal security. Look, I've read dozens of books written by ex Special Forces guys and the one singular new thing I learned from this book was that Owens owned a pair of helmet mounted night vision goggles that had 4 tubes instead of two,increasing range of vision from 40 degrees to 120. There's a photo of it in the book, fyi. I didn't know such a thing existed, but it makes sense that it does. My reaction upon learning that was \\"wow that's pretty neat\\" not \\"OMG the Taliban know our greatest secret!\\". Nothing else from weapons and gear to the brief (very brief) details about a very small portion of his DEVGRU training is new. Yes these guys use suppressed weapons when they want to. Yes they train for counter-terrorism operations. Yes they practice live ammo room clearing in 'kill houses'. Yes they fast rope from helicopters and skydive from airplanes. Real names of his teammates are not used and details of past operations that are likely still classified are kept vague. \\"Some dudes were deployed to afghanistan and/or iraq, they went on missions and often killed bad guys\\", isn't revealing any secrets.<br /><br />Getting to my experience with the book, I loved it. Cliché as what I'm about to say is, it holds true: the book is hard to put down and is a real page turner. Mark is a humble guy and a lot of the macho bravado seen in other SEAL books is absent here, which is refreshing. The book starts out with him and the other members of DEVGRU in their helicopters heading to Bin Laden's compound, then flashes back to bits about training and other past operations, stories that emphasize learning from mistakes, gelling as a team and gaining more experience and confidence after each deployment. There aren't dozens of pages explaining his experience at BUD/S like in other books (a fascinating subject on it's own, but saved for other books), and he briefly glosses over some of his earlier days on 'Green Team' after his initial acceptance into DEVGRU. Sprinkled throughout are some very funny stories about the pranks and practical jokes he and his teammates would pull on one another. Finally the last 3rd or so of the book finishes where it left off in the first few pages - the raid on the compound.<br /><br />Don't expect to learn much new here. It's the same basic story you've read about from magazine articles and websites over the last year. One of the blackhawk's has to crash land. Some guys raid the building and kill a few dudes and Bin Laden. They pack up his body and procure information from the compound. That's basically it. It's the little minute-to-minute details of how the raid unfolded that you get insight into with this book. Nothing new, but interesting in that it was told by somebody who was intimately involved.<br /><br />In my opinion there is absolutely nothing controversial contained in 'No Easy Day', so why the witch hunt? At the end of the day, all that matters is that Bin Laden is long gone. Rejoice in that and put the pitchforks and torches down, people - Mark Owens deserves some respect. At the very least buy this book - the proceeds go to charity.

I recommend this highly readable and informative book regularly to parents. It provides them and their kids with the rationale to start moving....and to keep moving.

I have multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease and would like her to write about someone with disabilities as she twists and turns her characters until you don't know what happens until the ending. Very Good Book.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game isn't that great. trying to get new games is annoying and not always easy...  I wouldn't reccomend it.
0756405890|5.0|Will it give you a clue as to how wonderful I thought this book was if I tell you that while I was still just halfway through I bought copies of the book for three of my friends so they could read it too? What a beautifully-written fantasy story this is. I am so eager to learn the rest of Kvothe's story ... bring on Day Two!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer was a good book with characters both unique and believable.  The screen script and the actors playing these parts kept them true to the original book.  Matthew McConaughey plays lawyers very well as did the other leads in their roles but I was just as impressed with Earl, his driver, and the biker gang.  Very insightful casting.  I would love to see more Michael Connelly books in movies if they are done as well as this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was skeptical to read these \\"racy\\" books, but wanted to know what they hype was about. I could not stop reading! I read the first book in 3 days and the 2nd and 3rd in the next 3 days!  This series has some very surprising twists and turns and in the end it's all about TRuE LOVE the best story in the world!<br />Read it and see for yourself. Even if you are not into some of the things in the story line, you will be pleasantly surprised by the way the story turns toward the end and how you feel after reading it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this a lot. it really does seem to be very accurate. I just wish the radar was easier to read and was interactive as well as local videos that showed more than general conditions. but all and all it's a good app to check conditions and possible storms anywhere in the world
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent read!!!! Could not put it down. Holds the reader from page one to the end. Only one problem, read em all in less then 2 days.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its not the best app in the world but I like it and use it<br />so I don't really know what else to say Soo
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love all of Philippa Gregory books.  I read the Other Boleyn Girl and then went back and read her older books.<br />This story is fantastic! I loved the characters and the story line.  I especially like the way I as the reader is transported back in time to the royal court.  It is a great story and am waiting patiently for the next installment!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I read some other reviews about other readers comparing this author to a high school student and criticizing her underdeveloped characters. If this is true, please, someone point me in the direction of this high school student. I would love to shake his or her hand! The plot held my attention and the characters are very well developed. I laughed and cried as I read this trilogy. Very well done!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love the story.  Had never heard of slam poetry but now I love it. Glad there was a sequel. Hope to see more of the author.
0062213423|3.0|When It came i was so happy. The book is huge an has so many pictures.. except the corners were bent, and the side was scratched and ripped..and on the front page there was food on it..like a food stain? so yeah...ugh. whatever im keeping it. ry to find a better one to you people! :D
B003XMAD3G|5.0|i bought this module for QNAP TS 869 Pro and its worth every penny for its functionality. Saved $100 bucks instead buying QNAP module.
0345803507|1.0|I succumbed to pressure and tried to read this series. I couldn't finish the last book. It just didn't end.<br />Some people got it and really enjoyed these books. I didn't, and I must admit in indulging in the odd Mills and Boons when on vacation. A rare and guilty pleasure.<br />The books are poorly structured. Peripheral characters/ bad guys don't even make sense. Not even on a surface level.<br />I really don't understand why this series is popular, the sex scenes are boring, and never ending. I never once felt a little naughty, and I appreciate a well written steamy sex scene.<br />Overall, I came away feeling confused, and still uncomprehending what it is about these books titillate other woman
0525478817|4.0|Funny to use the word \\"enjoy\\" with this book given the topic is Teenage Cancer.<br /><br />The main characters are well drawn; they elicit our sympathy but not necessarily in a maudlin way.  You feel empathy for them ... and their friends and their families ... and even for mere acquaintances.<br /><br />But for me there was one major annoyance : While the author captures the precociousness of his teenagers' voices, I felt he failed with the voice of the cantankerous, drunken Van Houten.  While Augustus and Hazel were maybe a trifle overwritten (though not to their detriment given their circumstances) Van Houten was underwritten and stayed a bit flat for me.  To be fair, if the book is aimed at Young Adults then maybe that is the way it should be ... but he always felt contrived, one dimensional and just there for the convenience of the plotline.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This was one of my favourite childhood films. I can remember curling up on the couch with my mother and watching this film many times. I wasn't sure what the DVD transfer would be like but it did not disappoint. Lots of extras as well. A must for John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara fans.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read a lot of the reviews online and most folks are bashing this author saying it's a rip of 50 shades and although i agree, E L James stole her characters from the  Stephanie Meyers Twilight saga.  None the less, i still enjoyed \\"Bared to You\\" and look forward to the sequel..  I actually felt so sorry for both of the main characters and look forward to reading what happens with them...
B008D37J6O|1.0|App did not play movies on my tablet. Did not work from day one. Avoid. It is an epic fail.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I loved it but one of my disks ended up skipping just a tad. It was great besides that.I love the series and I would recommend it but it has mature content.
B000002BBY|5.0|Great CD, listen to it everyday in my car on the way to work! Will be buying again. Cd packaged very well!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|We watched the trailers and were spellbound.  Too many movies today are essentially the \\"trailer\\", but not Hanna.  If i were ship wrecked on an island and could choose 10 movies, Hanna would be in the top 5.  The movie makes you think, and laugh so  hard, you might need a break for the toilet.  And if i could have Hanna with me on that Island life would be grand.  She is an innocent with skills and a mind set that trips you out.  She knows so many things that she doesn't even know she knows.  Hanna takes \\"home schooling\\" to a higher bar.  I hope they have a sequel.  Several sequels.  Watching Hanna on DVD tops the theater.  You can rewind to see a scene you thought you comprehended, but  as you re-watch, you see Hanna as the perfect person.  She is the Honey Badger of women.  You will not regret watching this.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was relieved when they came out with this app for kindle fire. The mobile site was mostly workable, but had all kinds of glitches. This works great, aside from the occasional freeze, which could be my kindle's fault.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely positively loved this book. It is without a doubt my favorite book thus far. I came across this book by accident I was googling similar books to fifty shades of grey and an article came up on my book boyfriend. This book was waaaay better than fifty. It left me wanting more. I felt the pain that Abby felt as well as te pain for travis. If anyone knows a similar book to beautiful please post it
0375507256|2.0|This book is borderline unreadable.  Even more, it doesn't really tie into each other except through cheap B-movie lines (like something you might read in a bad fantasy or romance novel).  The only part of the book that has any real narrative flow is the first part.  Then it quickly goes downhill.  My criticism isn't with the subject, the individual plots, or the overwhelmingly weak attempt to \\"tie everything together.\\"  It is just the poor quality of the writing.  It commits one of the worst crimes a book can be found guilty of...it is just boring.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The \\"LOST\\" complete collection is wonderful! I purchased it for my daughter and granddaughter, who are both fans. All the intricate parts for the game and the map that is the top of the box are incredible. This is not something you put away. It is a coffee table centerpiece.
0345536886|4.0|I love Grisham and have had some mixed feelings about a few of his last works. This one was a bit off the path and is probably the first  of his books I read where I found myself laughing on the very first page! His legal action is still there to be found but I did enjoy the new approach to this legal team almost portrayed as the Three Stooges.<br /><br />There was one section of this book that did have me scratching my head as it came out of the blue. Where, how and when did this poor soul stuck litigating this case alone come up with all the facts he used for the whereabouts of the drug testing? It may seem a small detail but let's face it, law is about details. While this books subject is probably not movie material it's characters certainly are!
B00881VLCE|1.0|Ok so at first I was loving the app, the controls worked fine on my kindle fire. After I got board of the origamal puzzles o decided to buy quite a few from the store. Today I went on to play the puzzles I got, and they were gone. They weren't in the store or in my puzzle s... Were did they go? I hope this will beck fixed soon but until then,  goodbye
0743201140|1.0|As part of a team building exercise, my employer bought and distributed these books to our whole team.  The book was brand new and our codes appeared to be unused.  The access code card in the back of the book was unbroken and didn't look like it had ever been touched.<br /><br />Every one of my team members, including myself, got error codes when we logged into the strengths finders 1.0 website.  Our manager contacted Gallup and we were told we would all need to purchase new books.  We spent well over $300 on books and it's more than disappointing to receive no help when there's truly a problem with the merchandise.<br /><br />I highly recommend staying as far away from this book and all other books released by this company as possible.  They're more interested in money than in customer help and satisfaction.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really love the concept of this game, and it's been so much fun to play. The only drawback is that on my phone there's just not enough screen space to play without frustration. It's best on a tablet sized device.
B005IQZB14|3.0|\\"Wild\\" was barely entertaining enough to keep reading. If the reader had some kind of interest in backpacking or survivalist type living it may have been more interesting. On the other hand, I enjoyed listening to the author's internal mantras  of power and courage. On her journey she was able to overcome many obstacles by focusing on her inner strength and by refusing to give up. Moral of the story-the only way to overcome life's tragedies is to continue to wake up every day and put one foot in front of the other.
B0086700CM|4.0|...and is indeed very good - simple controls, nice graphic, fast gameplay, good challenges.<br />The only reason I don't give five stars are the abrupt, angular turns. You have to be very quick and precise - not that it's hard, but I'd like a less stressy way with tilt turns similar to how you turn in a car race.
B0061JPT46|1.0|I loved this Lp & wanted it on CD because The Past Masters (which has all of this) also has some crap on it & I love the cover. However upon inserting it into my computer I found that it is a Mono versions & bonus tracks, which are also MONO. Says so under Album column in I-tunes. Also comparing them side by side to the Past Masters versions you can hear the inferior recording. They don't sound bad exactly just not as clear & not in stereo. The packaging is another issue. Its' a cardboard sleeve (JUst like the LP). It is a beautifuly produced package with a high gloss cover , but for some reason they decided to make it bigger than the Jewell box. It will sit on a shelf next to your other CD's but will not fit in your traveler.
B007WFR1TE|5.0|Yea its Fear Factory alright and its heavy, melodic and inspiring even in the face of the impending machine takeover.
B0071F3T0K|2.0|I think Hemingway wrote better books than this one.  The characters move about through the book in an alcohol induced haze and it gets a bit dreary after a while hearing about it.  Very little happens in the entire book.  Perhaps it was the fashion at the time it was written.  If you are curious and want to read all of his books, go ahead.  Otherwise I recommend you skip this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app for kindle fire. its just like the website, so now I can feed my pinterest addiction anywhere!

B008NMT684|4.0|Nice set of puzzles, some easier than others, with great colors. I sprung for the full version and do wish there were more to complete, but for $2 it's a good way to entertain a toddler for a bit.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album is as far from a sophomore slump as a band can get.  Many bands see fit to coast on the success of their first album, often not even matching it.  Metallica, on the other hand, managed to not only craft a record that far exceeded their first, but also established the pattern that their next two would follow.  If you need to introduce someone to the band in roughly 40 minutes, there's little better way to do it than Ride the Lightning.<br /><br /> Instead of the careless and in-your-face attitude of [[ASIN:B000002H5E Kill Em All]], we immediately hear a much more somber and cynical tone.  Ride the Lightning is preoccupied with death.  From nuclear holocaust, to execution, suicide, the biblical account of the killing of the Egyptian firstborn, and even Cthulhu itself, all the songs feature either an individual facing oblivion, or massacre on an enormous scale.  Grim?  Perhaps, but the bleak tone is tempered by the authenticity of the lyrics.  This is not for mere shock value; if anything, the album questions our acceptance of war, mutually assured destruction, and the death penalty.<br /><br /> Lyrical maturity isn't the only thing separating Ride the Lightning from Metallica's debut, though.  Composition has been majorly expanded here as well.  Songs are based around more riffs than before, and instrumental passages are much longer and more detailed.  \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" and the title track show this off the best, with the latter taking a jaw-dropping number of shifts and tempo changes.<br /><br /> Unlike Kill `Em All, which had a few tracks that wouldn't be missed if skipped, nearly all of Ride is essential Metallica.  \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is as violent as the nuclear war it describes.  \\"Creeping Death\\" and the title track are instantly memorable epics.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is as devastating as any song about a man destroyed by war can be.  Special mention goes out to \\"The Call of the Ktulu\\", an instrumental track inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  I'm a huge Lovecraft fan, and this song simply tickles me.  Despite its lack of lyrics, it calls to mind the image of a nightmarish creature rising from the sea to wreak havoc, only to fall asleep again in the end, although the harsh ending makes one wonder if this is a permanent state of affairs.  The only track that doesn't seem to measure up to the rest of the album's standards is \\"Escape\\", although it's not in and of itself a bad song.  It's just rather standard, and doesn't stand out amongst the rest of the album's phenomenal songs.<br /><br /> Normally I would list my criticisms now, but I honestly don't have any.  The album could have stood to be a bit longer, but it's far better to leave the listener wanting more.  Ride the Lightning does this, and Metallica would go on to satisfy that craving for more in 1986 with the even more colossal [[ASIN:B001229W22 Master Of Puppets]].ovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.

B003L77GH4|5.0|I am a huge Vampire Diaries Fan. I love the characters, story line, polt etc... This is a fantastic product and was in perfect condition. I watched this season twice. I can't wait to get the third season :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is very good on my kindle fire. I love that you can pin things right away and it works great!
B000E5N684|5.0|I really loved this movie. I love the main characters and the plot of the movie. It was suspensful and filled with a lot of lust and passion. The DVD arrived in great condition. I recomend this movie to anyone over 18 due to the nudity and sexuality but I would really recomend it to couples, it is a very adult movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|if you love pintrest than you must get the Kindle App. allows you to do  things that you can't,  by just going to the website. My most used app.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I was so pleased with this product, very good condition and arrived promptly. I am very intrigued by the story line, the drama and the characters. I am from a small town and this show portrays similar charactersitics to where I live and the people I interact with. You learn a lot through the drama and it is a joy to watch...even my fiance watches it with me and actually likes it.
B000SW2EYA|1.0|Reading the story line is why I purchase the movie. I thought it would be simular to Criminal Minds but it does not come anywhere close. I can understand Dexter\\"acting\\" as he does because he is suppose to not have any feelings, but the other characters have no excuse for their poor acting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to take pinterest with me on my kindle. It's nice to be able to take it upstairs and not have to worry about keeping anyone up or to glance at it for inspiration for a meal whithou having to wait on a computer to boot up or to find a cute pattern to sew for my little girl.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very fun, and addicting game. You start out trying to pass some idle time, and before you know it you'll be playing for hours!!! Awesome game.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|A good book... but it feels targeted at kids... and yet not appealing to kids.  I wish it was more adult.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie was well-done and well-cast.  It is not a strong plot, but deals with real life in a fantasy style.  LOVED IT!
B006VA57CY|5.0|Simply fantastic. Well acted and addictive story arcs. Moves me to tears, laughter on multiple episodes. Can't stop watching, and eagerly await Season 3.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|I don't feel as strongly as the blogger who wrote the article from which the excerpt below was taken.  The more i listen to Tempest the more some of it grows on me.  But i can understand where the blogger's coming from.  I look forward to the negative ratings and the abuse that will likely be coming my way!    \\"The first listen to Tempest was a slog. So was the second, and the third, and so on to what feels like the 100th. Dylan takes a Stockholm syndrome approach to melody and structure: build a verse from an unadventurous handful of notes, repeat ad infinitum, and by the song's eventual close the listener might be able to recall the tune. Words are fit rigidly to the metre - no ad libs here, or even much variation in delivery. Consequently, even the four-minute cuts seem to last roughly a year. The less said about the horrifying 14-minute title track, the better. It narrates the sinking of the Titanic in tediously descriptive detail, and succeeds only in making one long to be on the Titanic, where you'd at least get both an adrenaline rush and a merciful end.\\"  [...]
B006H5120E|5.0|I've loved this film, warts and all, since the first time I saw it in 1997. Have watched it numerous times since..... but I feel as though I've never seen it before now that I have the 3D Blu Ray.<br />It's nothing short of jawdropping. You feel as though you are \\"in\\" the film. Cameron and crew have provided the ultimate 3D film experience.<br />At first, it's a bit difficult to adjust to the full frame presentation of the 3D version.  We've become so accustomed to the 2:40 released originally. I kept telling myself that he must have cropped the sides. Wrong.  I put the Blu Ray version on another player and compared one frame side by side.  What Cameron has done is present the full frame of what was shot. Oddly, there's even more on the sides in the 3D frame plus the added height and bottom: you can see the ceiling and the back of the sofa in the 3D frame, you can't on the regular Blu Ray.<br />This release is to be treasured, especially for those of us who love the film.  It is Demo worthy in all respects.
0060836253|5.0|True to form, even though I gave this book five stars (and deservedly), I'm going to mention two issues of the \\"not entirely satisfied\\" flavor.<br /><br />For one thing, the edges of what constitutes a \\"god\\" become necessarily fuzzy, and Gaiman spends too much time on those edges. Yes, there are GOD-gods, but then there are folkloric beings like leprechauns (which I suppose can be in the \\"god\\" camp if we include any conception to which sacrifices and obeisance were made), and then there are cultural heroes like Whiskey Jack, and THEN there are historical figures around whom folklore has collected, like the Queen of Sheba and Johnny Appleseed... Should we then see, say, George Washington as a god? J. Golden Kimball? Rather than the personifications of abstract themes as the new gods (technology, media, etc.), should we then have John Wayne and Bettie Page?<br /><br />And the other, the elephant in the room of the novel: the absence of Christ, save a single passing reference to \\"that lucky son of a virgin.\\" Despite the novel stating repeatedly that America is not a good land for gods, the fact that the U.S. is the most Christian nation in the world kind of puts the lie to that, unless we bracket out Jesus. Is there the unspoken premise that Jesus is a \\"true\\" god, a being which is (as the philosophers would put it) necessary and not contingent, as all the other gods are? I don't know that Gaiman is a professing Christian, which would be a justification for that stance. The only others I could think of are that Gaiman knew that including Jesus would upset the entire balance of power between old gods and new (given that he would, by the novel's definition, be a very powerful old god among other old gods who have become taxi drivers and prostitutes and grifters to get by), or that Gaiman knew that dealing with Christianity would be the \\"third rail\\" which would spook publishers afraid of offending a large segment of the potential book-buying public. (I doubt the threat of boycotting Odinists would scare them as much.)boycotting Odinists would scare them as much.)
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|so far so good, can't wait for book 2! has a little of everything. The author holds me at the edge, up and down like a fun rollercoster
B002C949KE|4.0|Ariely convincingly points out how humans act in ways that defy \\"rational\\" economics -- how they assign value, convince themselves that a certain margin of cheating isn't dishonest, etc. -- to such a degree that people are often amazed at how little they know themselves.<br /><br />(The book loses one star for the unconvincing conclusions to several chapters, in which Ariely draws an oversimplified and unexamined connection between his experimentally indicated patterns of human behavior and a social policy stance.)

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from a free app, but the Calculator Plus Free apps is fantastic.  It is easy to use (as any calculator should be), it allows you to track what you are doing (without a lot of drama) and it has mulitiple functions that allow my kids to do their math homework on the go.  Besides that, it is very easy to see, the buttons are large enough to make use easy and it has a very straight forward design. As calculators go...I highly recommend this app.
B00727AM3Y|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this as a book and not an eread. It's wonderful story. A must read for teachers and teens. The author skilfully points out that people, no matter their circumstances, want to be valued for their unique abilities rather than labeled or judged.I had originally thought that I would donate the book to my local library after reading. I'm keeping it.My library needs to buy several copies of this book. The free shipping for Prime members made the purchase easy and painless.
B00005JLK1|4.0|the product itself was good nothing broken or scratched but the movie was alright a little weird but a thriller
B008XG1X18|4.0|it sometimes hangs when loading but other than that it's a great way to view pinterest. I wish it worked better on my phone but I mainly use my kindle for it anyway.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I hated this book. The characters were so terrible, they were not believable. The ending was sick. Hours of my life gone forever.<br /><br />That being said, I gave 2 stars because I did finish the book out of sheer curiousity as to how the author would write the ending. Like a car accident you can't help but stare at, even though it's awful.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I have tried all the stylus available Wacom Bamboo, Alu-pen Elago and more and nothing is better than this for smoothness and gliding across the glass.

0553801473|5.0|I loved this book, and really enjoyed GRRMs writing, as I did in the earlier books. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. Feast for Crows was slow, and I understand that everyone wants to know what happens, but I thought the second half of this book got to back the pace of the Storm of Swords, and you can start to see the story lines pointing back in the same direction. I am really excited to see what happens in the next book(s).<br /><br />It is too bad it will be 10(ish) years before the series finishes, and I'd love to have them faster, but what can you do? I'll wait. There are plenty of other things to do and read in the meantime.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are fantastic and the Kindle version (mine is on the Mac) is perfect.  Only con is that there isn't a 5th book, yet.

B003XRELEI|4.0|In modern parlance, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is what would be called a meta-novel.  It's largely a novel about writing a novel.  Though since this is Vonnegut it's not about a guy sitting at a typewriter or anything that boring.  It's more like in \\"Star Trek:  The Next Generation\\" when characters would go to the holodeck to interact with holographic representations of stories like Sherlock Holmes or noir detective Dixon Hill.<br /><br />In this case the author is Philboyd Studge (a stand-in for Kurt Vonnegut) and the holodeck is set to Midland City, Indiana in 1972.  The town is hosting a Festival of the Arts and the wealthy Eliot Rosewater (of the previous novel God Bless You Mr. Rosewater) contacts his favorite sci-fi author Kilgore Trout, featured in many other Vonnegut books.  Trout is shocked anyone's actually read any of his books as his stories are mostly published in porno magazines as filler with the titles often changed.  So Trout decides to go to New York City and then hitchhike to Indiana.<br /><br />Meanwhile in Midland City is Dwayne Hoover, who owns a Pontiac dealership and several other businesses.  By all accounts Dwayne has it pretty good, except his wife \\"ate\\" some Drano and died while his gay son works as a pianist in the Holiday Inn Hoover partially owns.<br /><br />The lounge of the Holiday Inn is where Hoover and Trout are destined to meet and where Hoover is destined to lose what's left of his mind.  Also in that lounge is Philboyd Studge, who has gathered his creations together to create a sort of creative Big Bang that will wipe out the old Philboyd Studge universe and create a new one.<br /><br />In the preface, Studge writes about how now that he's turned 50 he wants to sort of clear the air and empty out all these old ideas and characters so that he can create new ones.  Ironically though many of these same characters like Kilgore Trout appear in future novels by Vonnegut like \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" \\"Bluebeard,\\" and \\"Timequake.\\"  So if the point was to reboot the Vonnegut universe (to use modern comic book/movie slang) it didn't really succeed.<br /><br />Like many Vonnegut novels, the characters are in no way realistic.  Vonnegut via Trout actually takes \\"realistic\\" novels to task, claiming that we already know about real life, so why would we want fiction to duplicate that?  (I agree in part with that idea.  I mean, most of life is pretty boring, so why would I want that in a novel?)  Like my colleague Ethan Cooper, I would agree that the characters are largely cartoonish throughout the novel.  That didn't bother me too much, maybe because I watch too many cartoons on Fox and Adult Swim.<br /><br />Throughout the novel Vonnegut includes silly drawing of everything from an anus to a bucket of fried chicken to the abbreviation ETC.  The intent of these seems to be to serve as flashcards for a future audience where Earth no longer has apples or fried chicken, though you'd have to think they would still know what an anus looks like unless humanity has evolved beyond that point or superintelligent robots or cockroaches have taken over.  Like Ethan Cooper, I found this device tiresome after a while as it didn't really seem to contribute much to the actual story.<br /><br />Another thing is that this novel frequently uses the \\"N-word\\" and the depiction of most of the black characters in the book is pretty demeaning, especially the ex-con Wayne Hoobler.  Though I like to think of it not as racist but as a satire to protest the economic segregation that is still largely prevalent in the 21st Century.<br /><br />Overall, while the end may be a little disappointing, it is a heck of a ride to get there.<br /><br />That is all.t was to reboot the Vonnegut universe (to use modern comic book/movie slang) it didn't really succeed.<br /><br />Like many Vonnegut novels, the characters are in no way realistic.

1401232590|5.0|The story was very well written and the art style is different but in a good way. Now my favorite batman story. In my opinion, a very excellent buy.
B004ZJZQ5G|1.0|Sorry, I hated this version. I normally adore Keira Knightley as an actress, but she was not a convincing Elizabeth Bennet. Way too smiley and childish. The other actors seemed so wrong as well. Stay away from this version and just watch the BBC mini-series with Colin Firth.
B007SGM084|5.0|love them all and i hope there are more to come. just try them you might like them too. very descriptive. i will definitely reread them.
B00005MP58|5.0|I'm reviewing the dvd version, not the Blu-ray. I must say, this BBC mini-series is the absolute best one I've seen of Pride & Prejudice brought to screen. The actors, script, scenery, flow, etc were perfect. I cannot look at another Mr. Darcy other than Colin Firth. What a magical piece of artwork this film is. Please see this, you will not be disappointed!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I believe the author has once again expertly delivered on the whole kit and caboodle that readers have come to expect from the stories that surround Jack Reacher. Even though some of the story lines are quirky, so is the character of Jack Reacher. He is a homeless, highly decorated veteran who combines smart concentration with measures that allow him to live and last longer than any villain that he might come across. I love how the author shows us what his main character does and thinks during his adventures. I thought this novel needed a little more action, but  it is hard for writers to keep finding ways to entertain while not stepping over the boundaries that might offend the reading audience.<br />I hope readers enjoy Lee Child's latest novel as much as I did, and remember this is a book of fiction and is meant to entertain. However, in real-life - truth is aways stranger than fiction.<br />I admire Lee Child in many ways, and often wonder what other #1 New York Times bestselling author would save the first pencil they ever used when they sat down to write their first novel.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It kept me coming back to read more about what was going to happen next.  The story line was clear and concise and kept you coming back for more.  It kept me in suspense wondering what was going to happen next.  It wasn't graphic when it told about the different ways that the kids where killed but it was specific. I liked the way the love story was handled. I also liked the was the author ended the book.

0738735027|4.0|the mini version is soooo cute I love it. I think this is best cat's tarot deck. the theme design is very well done based on RW. i only wished if the booklet contained more about cat's nature and not only card meaning. Im thinking to have the bigger version of this deck.
B0083EW97W|1.0|Sonically, this is a departure for John.  It reminds me of Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians except he has pedal steel instead of wah-wah and the album is completely stripped of the funkiness that make his previous releases great.  Chances are, if you haven't bought this album by now, you're not a big John Mayer fan.  If you don't have Continuum, I would recommend buying it instead.<br /><br />In my opinion, Queen of California, Shadow Days and Olivia are the only songs on this album that stick with me after having this for several months.  QOC and Olivia are bluesy songs, something that John seems to have otherwise departed from.  It is a stripped down, back to basics sound that may be a little too basic for my tastes.<br /><br />If you're buying this album expecting a new and improved Continuum, you will be sorely disappointed.  The songs on this album (with the exception of those above) generally lack the lyrical songwriting skill from that album. The lyrics are a little too focused on growth, introspection and a particularly boring flavor of self-actualization that sound too much like a writer who's looking back at the partying/drinking crazy times and less like someone concerned with making another lyrical masterpiece.<br /><br />At times it seems like he's talking out loud in the lyrics which sometimes seem not well thought out.  It just seems like he is trying too hard at writing lyrics, struggling with themes and trying to 'make' lightning strike where it doesn't.  At times John makes grand gestures, patting himself on the back for realizations that come off as particularly sophomoric to most people over 25.  It's like listening to someone in an abusive relationship rationalize why they stay with the other person.  Or, perhaps more to the point, it sounds like John has had trouble with alcohol, partying and relationships and is trying to convince himself that he 'might' have a problem in these areas of his life.<br /><br />You can't make every album a Continuum, but this is the kind of release that is unfortunately going to put a lot of pressure on the career of this talented, affable and visionary artist.  If you have to have this album, the $5 Amazon price may be worth it.  I'd say play Continuum and hope that he can put out something in the future as good as that, if in a different style.  Otherwise, you might download a couple of the previously mentioned gems.  This is definitely one of those albums with a couple of good (or at least OK) songs and the rest of them are only for hardcore JM junkies.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I've had this for a little over a month and carry it in my pocket all the time. It is small enough to almost disappear and not be annoying. The twist-on type switch functions well. It's smooth and easy to cycle between the modes. The fit and finish is all very good. I have no complaints there.<br /><br />It is quite bright for its size and the lowest setting is sufficient for searching for something on the floor of a dark room or in the trunk of a car at night. The medium setting, which is the default when you first turn it on, is adequate for illuminating a room in front of you. The brightest setting is very bright and I don't use it much indoors. It might be more useful outdoors at night but I haven't used it that way. If you do, remember that the run time on high is probably going to be a little over an hour and that's if you had a full battery.<br /><br />I picked this model specifically as a pocket carry light because of the twist-on switch. I've carried a click-button light in my pocket before and it would accidentally turn on in my pocket, startling me as it got very hot. I can't imagine how this would accidentally turn on in my pocket.<br /><br />I also have a Fenix PD30 which is approximately twice as bright and will have longer run times as it uses 2 CR123A cells but for a bright, compact light this one is very good.
B0087UN94E|4.0|Not everyone likes Neil Young, but NY+Crazy Horse has a unique sound, and if you like that sound, this album epitomizes it.  Politically, I think Neil is a burned out hippie nutter, but I can look past that because he is one of my favorite songwriters. Even though he didn't write these songs, he adapted them all.  And though everyone in America knows these songs, he has made them completely fresh and interesting while keeping the original lyrics.  This has been my favorite new album so far this year and the bonus video is nice if you want something playing in the background.<br /><br />Neil did an interview on NPR regarding the development of this project.  The coolest thing about it, in my opinion, is that they have taken the original lyrics associated with these old songs and not candy-coated them like most revisionists (ie, people of his political leanings).  That's one of the refreshing things about this album--that Neil can vent his frustration and rage on age-old, real political problems such as government corruption and bribery etc.<br /><br />This album is a good fit for people who love Crazy Horse. It's also excellent for people who like unique takes on covers, those interested in production/songwriting or just folks who like grunge/rock.
0312576463|5.0|I really loved this book, as previous reviewer stated, not for everyone - if you want light and breezy, this book is not for you.  It's a long book, and it's got good character development - especially for the central characters.  Yes, it's a little dark, but that's what I like - as a big Roth fan.  Contrary to previous reviewers who said characters were \\"unlikable\\" I disagree -- Franzen just goes deeper into characters and gives you the warts and all, which to me makes them more likable.  If you liked The Corrections you will love, love this one - much better.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|The Avengers is a fine piece of film. But, it is not worthy of such titles as The Dark Knight Trilogy or the first Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. was great, as usual. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth did their best, but performed below my expectations. I didn't buy Captain America as the leader of the Avengers. I liked Chris Hemsworth in Thor, but not so much in the Avengers. ScarJo and Hawkeye actually were pretty good. Especially Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. Really, the Avengers is an overhyped, sub-par, Michael Bay fantasy mess. Each actor tried outdoing eachother in telling jokes and really Robert Downey was who saved it all from falling apart. And yes, Mark Ruffalo kicked butt as Hulk. He is definitely the best Hulk yet. But still, he along with Robert, couldn't save the film. Plus, a lot of convenient things happened for them. Such as Tony Stark surviving in space, the Chitauri shutting down all Phantom Menace style, and especially how they all were against and hated eachother and in a matter of minutes acted like best pals and worked together. Plus Loki wasn't very menacing. He seemed very weird and looked like how Robert Pattison does, about ready to die of starvation. Overall, the Avengers is an okay movie with a few funny parts and a bunch of explosions. But in the end, it had great potential, but just couldn't do it. 3/5
0525953728|5.0|As an avid reader, this is the one book that I have literally not want to put down while reading. I really appreciate \\"Mark Owen's\\" personal sacrifices and humility. I thought he was very real and I also appreciated his political incorrectness that we so desperately need in honest discussion today. I thought it was thorough in its recount of the raid and gripping. I was on the edge of my seat reading this the whole time. I felt like I was sitting next to him on the helicopter ride to and from the compound in Pakistan. An excellent book I recommend for everyone to read in that it sets the record perfectly straight, provides new insight on the mission, and the SEAL community. Best of luck Mark, but as your outstanding life has demonstrated, you probably won't need it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I still remember the day I first got my AX 720's by tritton. I was so happy with the quality that I never looked back. Then one day my mic stops working. I went on amazon trying to find a good headset to replace them and I decided to buy these. I was a little skeptical since they are wireless and I have never found wireless headphones to have great quality.<br /><br />These headphones are amazing. They work EXACTLY like I would have hoped them to and then extra. I can wash dishes in my apartment and even go outside and downstairs three flights to smoke and my friends can still hear me perfectly and I them. THe noise cancelling works just amazingly also. When I wash dishes my buds can't hear the water running but they can hear me. I turned on the option to have my voice funneled back to me and it was just as clear as they said.<br /><br />The sound quality on these headphones is much, much better than the Trittons I had and there is no obnoxiously long cord getting in my way and wrapped around my chair. And since they use a USB they work with my PS3.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting these headphones, stop thinking and just get them. They are so worth the money. They come with three programmable buttons and a lot of nice features. One nice feature is a voice morphing software. I actually have the morph option for \\"Space Squirrel\\" set to the first of my programmable buttons to mess with friends.<br /><br />Between the crystal clear audio, the wireless capabilities, the amazing microphone, the mute option, and countless other things these headphones are just amazing. Simply amazing. Also they turn themselves off after about 10 minutes of no audio so if you leave them on by accident it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Best headset 2012!!!
B005LAII6C|2.0|Look, even if these movies are for kids, can't the bastards in Hollywood TRY to be a little creative? Would it really kill them? It's the same plot, again and again and again: a kid is an outsider in his society; he is ridiculed, he makes major mistakes, his parents can't relate to him (especially his father), but he has a certain ability and he ends up saving his town/village/world/family from certain destruction, at which point everyone realizes he's just great and the feel bad about having demeaned him in the past.<br /><br />HOW TO TAME YOUR DRAGON---the son of a Viking chief is a misfit, living in a village harassed by dragons. The son, who is an inventor of sorts, brings down a dragon with a catapult, then befriends said dragon. Boy saves village.<br /><br />PARANORMAN---the son of a fat man is able to see and speak with dead people. Other live people cannot do so, so they think that he's nuts. He lives in a Salem-style village where a witch was hanged centuries ago. The witch comes back to destroy village. Dead people give the boy clues to stop her. Boy saves village.<br /><br />RAIN WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS---the son of a shopkeeper is an inventor whose inventions cause havoc. He invents a machine that turns rain into any kind of food. The village becomes famous. Unscrupulous mayor wrecks machine, which goes totally out of control and starts to destroy village. Boy saves village.<br /><br />CHICKEN LITTLE---the son of a rooster causes an alarm in the village because he thinks that the sky is falling when a metallic object falls from the sky. He is ridiculed for the panic. Another object falls and the village is attacked by space aliens. Chick saves village.

Shrink wrap and it looked as though the Blu-Rays were never removed from the packaging.  It even had the theft proof tab behind the booklet.  It's great and I am glad I didn't pay what stores wanted for it or versions that were brand new.  Thanks for a great set.

1594630844|5.0|I am 67 and wish I had been able to read this book 30 years ago.  I bought 5 copies to give to friends and family.  It was very insightful on many aspects of life.  It was so well edited with the stories and then a review of the lessons.  I especially enjoyed the ones about marriage, parenthood and old age.  My mother, who was a school teacher, always said, \\"You can't put an old head on young shoulders.\\"  But if there is a way, this book will help you do it.  I sent one copy to our son in Hawaii.  Now that he is a parent of 2 kids, one 15 months and 1 only 1 month, I am sure they will glean a lot of wisdom from the parenting section.  If more people read this book, there would be fewer divorces, better behaved children, and a healthier society.
0345803507|1.0|Bought all three books for my wife......She said the writing style is very amateurish and difficult to follow among other faults. In short - not worth the money spent on all three books. As a marketing campaign absolutely brilliant. Most people won't spend $45 for a book but got reeled-in by $15 x 3 and probably don't even realize they DID spend $45. WOW!!. Giving all 3 to a relative. What a rip!! This marketing team can probably get hired by Romney if they act fast..
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I gave this recording 4 stars based on two things: first, the material is first rate and not over recorded even by blues singers. Second, the musical performance is exceptionally good by Mr. Laurie & his fellow musicians, both well played and layered with nuances not captured by many bluesmen using one or two instruments. While many reviewers have pointed out the weakness in Mr. Laurie's vocals, I say he is no worse then many of the great bluesmen. Listening to many of the blues vocals, both men and women, in my collection, I contend that most of these notable people were not in themselves great vocalists.  If it's great vocalists I want then I put on Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Damone, Clooney, Bennett, Vaughan and many others too numerous to mention in this review. The blues are more about feelings then vocal prowess. Mr. Laurie paid a respectful homage to a genre of music by selecting great material and delivering a worthy effort.[[ASIN:B005IFWXWU Let Them Talk]]

0307951529|5.0|I stumbled across this book from a news article and promptly devoured the free preview that Amazon offered.  I soon located a copy and found it to be not only an easy and understandable read, but a real thought provoking book that had me looking at things from a 180 degree perspective.<br /><br />I've felt the itch to go out on my own for the last couple of years, but felt that the only \\"safe\\" way to do that was via a franchise.  While that may be the case, the thought of going into major debt has ultimately held me back and kept me stuck in a rut.  Chris does a great job of explaining how things have changed in the accessibility to successfully starting and running a business and how these changes make it much more conducive for a single person to make the leap and grow for very little investment.<br /><br />The only thing I felt lacking (and which I suffer from) is a brainstorm type of exercise or quiz to help nail down the things I'm good at that could then be coupled to the rest of the book.  Dammit Chris read my mind! :)<br /><br />Bottom line is that this book should be added to your library as not only is a great approach to things, but it is also an excellent resource that can be called upon over and over as time goes by.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|It has been a long time since I listened to an album where each song made me so eager to hear the next one.  How I missed this guy for 14 years and 8 albums is a mystery to me.  Great songs, sharp writing about coping with hard times with independence and pride.  Hard driving, engaging music with clear vocals, painting an honest portrait.  Buddy Miller harmonizes on a couple of cuts and John Prine joins in on a verse on the title song.  Buy it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|is awesome!! I don't think I have ever played anything so fun in my life. garenteed play this its a major time killer
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The novel has a great premise and I really enjoyed most of it.  However, I did find that the author got a little too detailed about relatively minor plot developments which slowed down the narrative too much.  For example:  telling me that a character ate a meal is fine; telling me about each course in detail is not really necessary.  I have a feeling that the story was expanded somewhat from an initial version that may have been more tightly written.  But, to be clear, the story is enjoyable and well worth it.

B005I3PAUO|2.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books. While few lived up to the standards set with the first books like The Winner and Total Control, this one turned out to be extremely boring. It was more like writing a book for the sake of writing than becuase it actually had any entertainement value. Made for excellent bed-time reading though- just getting through one page was sufficient to fall asleep.<br /><br />Request: This is MY opinion- do not get upset if you have a different opinion.
0152465073|5.0|The narrator of this story had an accident with his plane and ended up in the Desert of Sahara. While trying to fix his plane, a little boy appeared out of nowhere. He was a prince and only inhabitant of Asteroid B-612; it was a very tiny planet.<br /><br />For days, while the narrator worked on his plane, the prince told him of his journey to Earth. He stopped at planets and spoke with different types of people. He told him of his own planet and the unique, one-of-a-kind flower he tended to but left behind.<br /><br />The prince told the narrator of the fox he met on Earth who told him a secret, \\"the secret of what is really important to life.\\" Through his stories, the prince told the narrator the secret and the lessons behind it.<br /><br />I GIVE THIS BOOK: 4 1/2 out of 5<br /><br />\\"There are few stories that in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\\"<br /><br />A friend gave me this book. It is her absolute favorite book and wanted to share it with me. When I got it, I thought it was a children's book. When I read it, I imagined reading it to my children and thought, there are too many big words for a child to understand or pronounce. Then I thought it was an adult book using a childlike story to convey a message. However, barnesandnoble.com states this story is for children 9-12 years of age.<br /><br />First published in 1943 and translated by many people, some of the story can be translated differently. That, the slow start and the big words is why this book does not have a perfect rating. People in the early 1900s spoke differently than what we are used to today and that made me smile, but it also made me have to read some sentences twice.<br /><br />This book is a must buy and a must read to your children, even if they are young. The morale to this story, the secret, needs to be planted in the minds of children. The lesson the prince learned along the way are really good lessons to instill in your children.<br /><br />I am shocked I have never heard of this book. Other friends in my circle have not heard of it either. This book is a must have on your bookshelf, no matter what your age!<br /><br />If you don't agree, check it out for yourself!<br /><br />Until next time, take life one page at a time!<br />I am shocked I have never heard of this book.

B001FB4W16|5.0|The Box set was used for less then half the price as new.<br />1. I purchased them in like new condition and it was. The seller was great.  It arrived quickly and was in great condition. The DVDs played flawlessly.<br /><br />2. The True Blood Blue Ray DVD set.  The video transfer is excellent as well as the sound.<br />The books are better but if you watch the show as a story based on the books and not as the books themselves it is good.<br /><br />Bottom line I would recommend this set and so far I have bought 2 DVD sets from Amazon as used and both were great.<br />The other I bought had a condition Very Good and the DVDs played flawlessly and box had wear showing.  Buying used and saving some money is great when you know the product will not be damaged(DVD) not the box.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|A great family movie that covers environmental responsibility in a fun and fanciful way! My kids love it and even I can't get the songs out of my head!
B001P5HI4A|1.0|Ouch! This is an utterly unwatchable vanity production and stands as a huge smear on an otherwise semi-remarkable career. Streisand is no actress, regardless of her insistences to the contrary. I pity the poor folks who had to suffer through being \\"directed\\" by Streisand and who had to all sign gag orders agreeing never to speak of the experience in public. I'd really like to hear what they went through to meet this \\"director's' VISION. LOL LOL LOL I mean, none of them ever worked with her again!<br /><br />I am 1000% certain that \\"Gypsy\\" will NEVER be made, and I think that's a good thing. She is WAYYYYYY too old to carry that role off.<br /><br />And the release of the new \\"Guilt Trip\\" movie has been delayed interminably, no doubt because of the negative having to undergo EXTENSIVE LAB WORK so that all the new HD technology doesn't show what Babs truly looks like these days.<br /><br />Also a good thing!<br /><br />And those of you fans who actually believe that a 12-disc DVD of unreleased \\"treasures\\" is really in the works need a wake-up call. That \\"project\\" was announced when BS renewed with SONY strictly to demonstrate that she could still conjure interest from her devoted fanbase. She promised this same thing back in the 80's, remember? So what's taking so long? I'll tell you: There is no 12-disc DVD set in the works but it behooves her financially to make you folks think there might be. Your disappointment is IRRELEVANT to her! That's how much she thinks of the people who made her what she is!
1439102430|2.0|Normally, I'm a fan of Kathy Reichs.  I've read all of her other books and really enjoyed most of them.  Until now.<br /><br />The thing I like most about the Temperance Brennan novels is the amount of time spent detailing Brennan's work as a forensic anthropologist.  The information she learns from the bones is what makes her unique and interesting, and consequently, is what really makes or breaks these books.  I think that was the main problem with this one: very little time was devoted to Brennan spending time with the bones.  Instead, she spends most of her time chasing a quarry all over Canada (a quarry who turns out to be mentally challenged, yet manages to outsmart Brennan, Ryan, and their Royal Mountie friend for quite some time).<br /><br />Another problem I had with this book was the love triangle.  The on-again, off-again relationship between Brennan and Ryan has gotten tedious at this point, so Reichs decided to spice it up a bit by throwing in a second guy.  Great, just what this series needed.  Not.  And as usual, at the end of the book, Brennan had still made zilch progress romantically, despite the fact that she's apparently the type of gal no guy will ever get over.<br /><br />Which bring me to my next point.  I'm by no means a feminist, yet by the time I finished reading this book, I was somewhat offended by Reichs' portrayal of female characters.  (Her heroine excepted, of course, who is such hot stuff that guys are always fighting over her!)  Brennan ragged on the physical appearance of practically every other woman she met in this book.<br /><br />But I think the biggest problem for me was the sheer implausibility of the plot.  It began with the discovery of several sets of bones, which turned out just to be a side-plot in the tale of a much bigger conspiracy that eventually got so convoluted and honestly, uninteresting, that I ended up not really caring at all.  I didn't care about diamonds or drug dealers!  I wanted to know the story behind those bones, which Reichs finally wrapped up for me as an aside in the space of about a paragraph tacked on at the end.<br /><br />Not only will I think twice about purchasing the next book in this series, I'll think twice about even reading it.
B0090EIILU|4.0|If you like stupid humor you will enjoy this movie.  It wasn't a constant laugh, but there are definitely some good parts that make it worth watching.
B00932A2MC|3.0|This movie follows in the tradition of all of the Micheal Bay/Jerry Bruckhiemer films. It is loud, action packed, silly at times, and is made to be a bit of a feel good film. Battleship isn't deep and engaging. It's just a series of CGI shots thrown together. It is a wonderfully shot film. A whole lot of money went into the cameras and special effects. For some reason, Liam Neeson is in this film and although he's just collecting a paycheck, he still does an amazing job at delivering lines. If you are looking for something dumb and fun to watch, give this a try. The Avengers comes out less than 2 weeks from this review, so know that Marvel's The Avengers is the superior film by far, but if you can't wait and need something this instant, this isn't too bad.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This sequel was engaging, dramatic, intelligently written, loaded with action, dealt with the main character's conflicting emotions and inner struggles well, and all-in-all was a great read!
034580404X|4.0|I'm a guy and most of my guy friends can't believe I read these books. In fact, I read them at the same time my wife did, racing only pages behind her for the two or three weeks we indulged ourselves. Is it a racy story? The parts about bondage are different, though not shocking particularly. Is it girly? Not at all. I think if more men read it, there might be a lot more happy women out there. Don't get me wrong: I have no interest in attempting most of the acts Anastasia and Christian accomplish in this book (though it did inspire a couple of my own ideas that my wife seems to appreciate now). What it did was help me appreciate what excitement and spontaneity can do to a relationship...any relationship.<br /><br />I think if you have read Sandra Brown or Linda Howard, you'll appreciate 50 Shades of Gray for what it is: a romance with some edge. Whether male or female, the two main characters are well developed by the author and we fall in love with both of them very quickly. We even begin to understand their motivations which, when you consider the initial premise is about a dominator and his conquest of submissives, is a commendable feat.<br /><br />I found myself rooting for, and relating to, Christian's efforts. I found myself astounded sometimes by Anastasia's responses. But I'm a guy. My wife understood Anastasia completely and didn't get Christian at times.  Neither of us read romances as a rule and considering this trilogy has little violence or intriguing plot line, I'm amazed I actual got through the three books. Was it because of the sex? No, that pretty much dwindled after Book 1. It was the way E.L. James built the characters into real life beings; people we began missing the second we put Book 3 down.<br /><br />To summarize, you won't learn a whole lot about bondage by reading these books. But you will learn a lot about the human capacity for unconditional love, and what it takes to achieve that lofty goal.
0788859544|5.0|My grandson has been watching the film every day.  He loves it and also has memorized the songs.  His father, my son loved it also when he was little.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Aside from craving sushi, the feeling you get when watching this documentary is inspiring.  Jiro and his team work tirelessly striving to constantly improve their craft.  While the film focuses on one man's life work, and let me say his work has brought him to the top of his field, the overall message is humbling. Some boast about their skills, awards, or success, but not Jiro his sons or his team. To see a group of people passionately enjoy their day to day career with no complaints is almost unheard of, and yet it is believable after watching this story.  This documentary touches on bigger issues such as overfishing but does not throw it in your face like so many other documentaries; the issues are interwoven into the film simply because they are the issues Jiro has noticed!  I can honestly say this documentary is elegant in its simplicity and I would enjoy watching it again.

B003AYPMBU|5.0|Judas Priest's sixth proper full-length, 1980's \\"British Steel\\" is really a unique record. It marks the start of the five NWOBHM icons streamlining their sound, as it made a significant stride towards moving heavy metal music to the mainstream. (It is like the 1980's version of Metallica's \\"Black Album.\\") But \\"British Steel\\" is also a surprisingly heavy album -- J.P.'s heaviest this side of 1990's \\"Painkiller.\\" This is, for the most part, due to legendary guitarists Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing playing some of the absolute best riffs and solos of their whole recording career. The rest of the band is at the top of its game, here, though, too -- particularly frontman Rob Halford, whose top-notch vocals soar majestically over meaty, heavy bass lines and deft drum patterns. As a result of these things, \\"B.S.\\" is one of the most important and influential milestones on hard rock/heavy metal's timeline. It would go on to inspire countless bands in the Eighties, Nineties, and new millennium, including trillions of speed metal, thrash, prog, and power metallists. Also, to this very day, it remains the Priest's greatest achievement.<br /><br />Opener \\"Rapid Fire\\" basically has \\"classic\\" written all over it. It blasts out of the starting gate as an early thrash/speed metal song with tons of deft, propulsive, chainsaw speed metal riffage, and excellent, soaring, power metal-like clean vocals. And, to cap it all off, the guitarists trade-off a bunch of nice, tasty, winding, and fast solos. The album's pace briefly winds down for another aptly-entitled song, \\"Metal Gods,\\" a mid-tempo and groove-oriented number with swarms of crunchy guitar licks and great, bluesy melodic soloing. Things pick right back up again after that, though, as \\"Breaking The Law\\" is an insanely catchy and infectious up-tempo track. Then comes \\"Grinder,\\" a terrifically hooky and rhythmic head-bobber that is long on strong, prominently-audible, grumbling bass lines, and very excellent, lengthy, and wailing melodic soloing.<br /><br />\\"United\\" is \\"British Steel\\"'s centerpiece, and an epic one at that, as it boasts the definition of a truly anthemic, huge, very famous, and instinctively memorable chorus (with powerfully catchy sing-songy vocals). \\"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\\" boasts another epic, memorable, stadium-sized sing-along chorus, and enhances it by adding a reggae-like bass intro, chugging, industrial-strength riffs, and ripping, technically-impressive solos to the mix. The subsequent \\"Living After Midnight\\" is another big standout, seeing how it is full of solid, deliciously crunchy and groovy guitars and contagious choruses that practically scream \\"hit single.\\" And so is \\"The Rage,\\" with its ominous, beeping introductory bass solo. The rest of the band eventually come screaming in, with drummer David Holland thumping out a beat while the guitars throw-out gobs of wonderful, wailing, ascending and descending solos. (Trust me, folks -- this solo section is one for the books!). Another memorable chorus is tucked into the mix, here, as well.<br /><br />The album concludes with \\"Red, White, & Blue,\\" a dreary, anthemic, soaring, and impressively-cleanly sung power ballad. But this is not before Judas Priest drop \\"Steeler,\\" which just might be the set's heaviest and most aggressive piece. It is backed by fiery, thrashy, and ultra-chunky and inventive riffs, a tasty, galloping rhythm, and a nice, ascending melodic guitar solo. Holland deserves recognition here, too, though, as he does a good job of keeping up with the rest of the band, no matter how speedy they might be playing. He lays down a stream of bouncy drum fills, including a bit of what sounds suspiciously like some double bass pounding. And a wild, shredding solo section caps off \\"Steeler\\" in suitably righteous and hard-rocking fashion.<br /><br />\\"British Steel\\" has been reissued several times, the most recent being in 2010 with an impeccably-performed and palpably energetic live version of \\"Grinder,\\" a live DVD, and the audio C.D./sound equivalent to that live set captured on film. Although it succeeds in finding a special way to commemorate the disc's whopping 30-year anniversary, none of this bonus material is worth going out of one's way to acquire. Think of them simply as the icing on the cake to \\"British Steel,\\" an already just-about flawless album, Judas Priest's masterwork, a timeless watershed release which has been immensely enjoyed and appreciated by (and would, in time, prove to be a huge inspiration for) three generations of widespread and rabidly-loyal fans. And, considering it is one of the most essential and iconic pieces in the history of hard rock/heavy metal, it is one that will doubtlessly be enjoyed by many generations to come.r,\\" a live DVD, and the audio C.D./sound equivalent to that live set captured on film.

B004WGIXX4|4.0|All the actors did a great job and there were funny parts, but something was missing. The flow was off and when a huge part of the plot would change I was left thinking, \\"Umm, okay?\\" because there were no smooth transitions. They could have easily added more punch lines as well. But all in all, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to SOME of my friends. I watched it twice, though I can see things that others wouldn't be able to get past.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I read other reviews and was curious, so decided to read this actually to see if it would be a good book for my 12 year old daughter to read (better for an older teen, as there is swearing and reference to someone getting a \\"boner\\" over something they were interested in). I like the authors descriptions...the scenes palpable.  The beginning gripped me, and the middle kept me fairly interested..toward the end, it started to lose focus, almost like the author wasn't sure what to do with the ending.  That being said, the ending was much more like the opener for a sequel than an ending, which I was less than thrilled with (unless of course there's a sequel I don't know about...which I would probably read just to get a more detailed, less jumbled description time travel).  If there is no sequel...ending was far to open ended for me.  If you like an open ended book so you can fantasize about what happened to them, you'll like it a lot.  I did think the photos and hand-written notes made it more fun, and more creepy...in a good way.  Tough to read the hand-written notes on the kindle though...and you can't change their font, I tried!

0425263908|2.0|I just finished reading the Fifty Shades series and this book was recommended to me.  Disappointed is putting it mildly. I did not feel the pull of the two main characters.  I understand that the author was trying to use shock therapy on the reader but I just thought it was too much going on.  The bi-roommate with the four-way sex scene was way over the top and gross....no romamce in that. Even the main characters names (Eva and Gideon) don't envoke a feeling of warmth or love.  In all actuality it is the author that doesn't bring her characters to true life in the readers mind. I never felt the draw of Eva and Gideon....you know when the author captures that \\"there's just something about you feeling\\" in a romance.  It makes your heart remember when you first met your special someone.  It takes a really good writer to do that.  I will say the first sex scene was well written....capturing lustful can't wait sex.  Good.  The bad was what came after.  The author didn't make the intensity of Gideon's withdraw felt correctly.  She wrote about Eva's thoughts but not Gideon's.  I couldn't figure where the romance was.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|What's with all the melancholy music?  I don't get it?  Is there something sad happening because I don't see it.  There is nothing sad happening but yet they keep playing this weird melancholy music all the time.  Is he sad about something?  Well we don't know what it is.  Well cheer up cause it's REAL irritating.  I originally ordered 2 Jesse Stone videos with the intention of getting more but now I think I will pass on getting any more and get something a little more entertaining (unless you enjoy the grief tone level).  The melancholy music didn't fit in to what was going on and therefore real irritating.  It had Tom Sellik our hero from the 70s (Magnum PI) which did give a redeeming aspect to it.  But cheer up Tom gee whiz.
B0000399WI|5.0|Andy Dufresne is drinking whiskey and holding his gun.  He is loading it while sitting outside the house where his wife is in bed with the local golf pro.  He claims that he sobered up and drove home and threw his gun into the river and didn't do anything.  Andy (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her boyfriend.  The evidence is not strong but he is still convicted to a double life sentence to be served sequentially.  They declare the act a horrific crime as the victims were shot 8 times and he had to reload the gun to do that and shoot them in the head.<br /><br />As he arrives to prison he is on a bus and the entire prison population is in the yard taunting those on the bus.  The prisoners are betting on which of the new comers will break down first.  The captain of the guards is Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) and he is tough on the prisoners and the warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) is religious but he believes in punishment and lets Byron have his way in dealing out pain.<br /><br />Andy becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) who is the main smuggler for the inmates to get them contraband items.  Andy wants a small rock hammer to hand make a stone chess set and he also wants a poster of Rita Hayworth for his wall.  Andy is a quiet man but he has a fire that burns within him, an intelligent mind and he has a plan.....<br /><br />This is simply the best conversion of a Stephen King novel to a movie that has been done.  The movie is also one of my all-time favorites as the storyline, directing and especially the acting is superb.  This little known movie should have won academy awards but it did not win any even though it was nominated for 7.  It is one of Morgan Freeman's and Tim Robbins best roles.  The written script is just flawlessly done.<br /><br />I really liked this movie and I recommend it to you.  I believe that if you haven't seen it then you will enjoy it.  It is entertainment at its best.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|This movie starts as do most good fights, with Cassius Clay training, running and shadow boxing.  Cassius (Will Smith) is young, fast and strong but most of all cocky.  He even taunts the champion of the world at the weigh in.  Sonny Liston is mad and wants to teach him a lesson.<br /><br />The movie shows the budding relationship between Cassius and Howard Cosell (John Voight).  Before the fight, Clay is calm and collected in the locker room.  You could have heard a pin drop as his focus is so intense.  He wants to show the world that he is the champion of a new generation of boxers.  The bookies say it will not last one round and Liston will win by KO.  Clay dances and floats and Liston can't even hardly touch him.  Clay warms up and they continue fighting after the bell ends the round.<br /><br />Liston is the aggressor but Clay dances and begins to wear the champ out.  Clays' speed and accuracy with his punches begin to take a toll.  It is implied that Liston has something put onto his gloves and he rubs it into Clays' eyes.  Clay can't see and they tell him to get onto his bicycle. Clay is hurting as he can't see to fight and he is really struggling.  Clays' vision clears and his determination to be the champ brings him back into the fight.....<br /><br />And so begins the saga of one of the most famous American athletes in modern times.  The movie covers Ali's life from his fighting career, his conversion to Islam and he changes his name to Mohammad Ali.  This is a great movie and Will Smith did a fabulous job portraying Ali but the film is just too long. The movie is 157 minutes long and if it had been cut to 120 it would have been a tighter and more action filled film.  Even despite the length it is a 4 star movie and it is worth seeing.  Will Smith did a career performance in this role and I like him as an actor.  He made this movie.  I recommend it to you.

B0058YPLA2|4.0|How could a show that takes the princesses and characters from every fairy tale known to modern man and woman not be a sensation? That's my question to anyone who challenges the success of ABC's \\"Once Upon A Time.\\" You're guaranteed to have a hit show when it appeals to any female on Earth old enough to watch \\"Cinderella\\" or \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"<br /><br />ABC Studios released \\"Once Upon A Time: The Complete First Season,\\" giving people who have a hard time keeping up with television program schedules a chance to take in the series at their own pace. It won't take but one or two episodes to get a viewer hooked. They'll soon find themselves zooming through the episodes one after the next in anticipation.<br /><br />A boy named Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up on Emma Swan's (Jennifer Morrison) doorstep. He claims to be the son she gave up for adoption ten years earlier. Henry shares a theory with her as she drives him home to the little town of Storybrooke, Maine. He believes all the citizens of Storybrooke are fairy tale characters living under a curse his adopted mother and mayor of the town, Regina (Lana Parrilla), put them under. Henry is certain Regina is the wicked witch from the story of \\"Snow White.\\" The boy believes Emma is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) and she is destined to lift the curse Regina put on the town.<br /><br />It's amazing how well writers for this show mash together all the fairy tales we grew up reading, hearing, and seeing. It's a complex storyline that interweaves so many mythical characters you literally just sit there at times wondering who or what is going to show up next. It truly is a soap opera for fairy tale lovers.<br /><br />Being a comic book fan, I can't help but bring up the similarities \\"Once Upon A Time\\" has to Bill Willingham's graphic novel series \\"Fables.\\" The book has been around since 2002 and ABC even optioned the comic at one point to develop it for television. It's hard to believe years later they just happened to come up with a similar concept.<br /><br />Producers claim they hadn't read any of the issues before they created the show. Strangely, the series has issues of Marvel Comics lying around different scenes as if they're taking shots at DC and Vertigo Comics who published \\"Fables.\\" DC and Marvel are known to be competitors in the comic book world.<br /><br />Consumers and fans of the show will be happy with the bonus material found on the Blu-ray release of the series.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|Is Dark Shadows a shameless mug of the original soap opera?  No.  Is it a great film?  No.  Is it amusing, witty, well written, well directed and well shot?  Yes.  Is it worth seeing.  Oh yeah.  But it is not worth seeing if you have preconceived notions about exactly what Dark Shadows was or should be, almost 45 years on.  This is no soap opera, produced on a string and started as a daytime television experiment, which outlasted it's shelf life by about 2 years.  Burton's version is a well developed camp comedy, chock full of double entendres and dynamite characters.  The actors in this picture are obviously having a riot, chewing up the scenery like a bunch of manic piranhas.<br /><br />The secret to this film's success is that it takes the metaphor and irony of the original soap opera to it's camp zenith.  Half of the fun of the soap opera was the production 'on the cheap' and all of the errors that went with it.  Even as 12 year olds, we screamed with laughter at the collapsing scenery, head-bonking boom mike and Joan Bennett's glassy-eyed, forgotten dialogue.  Though Burton's production is anything but cheap, he breathes the original improbability of the entire situation into every frame and makes the most of every minute, while maintaining the original's plot.<br /><br />Those looking for a literal version of the original cheesy production need only see the revival produced in the 90's and not bother with this.  You won't get it and more importantly, won't like it.  This is a Tim Burton picture and not a 'Dan Curtis Production'.  It's meant to be fun and dark, unexpected and provocative, witty and dry.  For those of us who embraced the horrendous improbability of what was Dark Shadows, when we were 6th graders, Burton gives us the hilarious memories sans the forced maudlin drama of daytime TV or a serious rendition of a camp classic.  Anything like that would've died a wrenching death.<br /><br />There could've been nothing worse than making this amazing storya 'True Blood' or 'Twilight' redux, which was a petrifying possibility if anyone besides Burton had gotten ahold of the property.  The casting is excellent and cinematography superb.  If you love camp, this is one of your pictures!  Others need not apply.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am the type guy that doesn't really read books, mostly watching tv & movies or reading magazines about cars and other \\"guy stuff\\". However, I decided to give the sample for the kindle a try and was hooked. While I read other reviews saying the book was bad because of this or that, I found it to be a nice escape to read it. I had to fight with my wife over the kindle as she was trying to read her books, which totally shocked her, LOL!! Took me about 3-4 days to read the book. I had fun reading it and would recommend it to everyone.
B003HYNB34|5.0|Dr Who started in 1963 on the BBC. The newer Dr Who is still a great tv series with many great story lines.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|This album has all the electronic sounds we loved from the previous album and yet it is more profound and deep. Like many other comments, they have matured into a even greater band than before! Love the whole entire album. Five stars. Anyone complaining about this album has a seriously bad taste in music and should go listen to nikki minaj or something.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great way to pass the time.  if you like puzzles but don't have the space. this is a great way to get your puzzle fix.
0525953728|5.0|An excellently written first hand account of one SEAL's version of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. We shouldn't be focusing on learning everything we can about who OBL was, we should be learning about these amazing men of courage and the sacrifices they make for our country every day.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I was afraid to download this app after reading negative reviews,  but decided to try it out.  Glad I did!  I haven't had any of the glitchy problems mentioned.  Love this app and it works faster and better on my Kindle than going through fb or google.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Definitely something to discuss at the water-cooler!<br />Recommend to all!  A new and different way to look at what you once thought might have just been coincidence.
B008VBYN80|3.0|I downloaded this only to redownload it two weeks later. after a certain point now the game wont even load. My kids love it but we can't play now. Help please.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I use this with a white 4s. I love the way this case looks and how it showcases the iPhones look. The circles on the back really grew on me after a couple weeks of use.  Also, when you use the camera's flash, the whole case lights up in a cool glow. It looks sweet whenever I use the flashlight app.  I have dropped my phone with this case a couple times and all is well! A few negatives after using this case for about 2 months... Only when I use it in bed sometimes my hands get a little sore when holding the phone with one hand. Sometimes I'll just take the case off when I'm in bed (case can be taken off very easily).  Also, due to its clear nature, you definitely should try and wash the case every week or so. I've been washing mine but even so, its starting to get some color and lose its nice clear look. One more negative is the case goes right up to the edge of the screen, and when I try to move apps to different pages by moving my finger to the edge of the screen, the case gets in the way and I have to kind of push it to the side. But for the price, this is a great case, extra awesome that it comes with a screen protector :)

B0000CABBW|5.0|As legend has it, Paikea, an ancestor of the Maori tribe, rode to their sacred land in eastern New Zealand on the back of a whale.  The leader of the Maori tribe has always been the first born son, but when the Chief's son loses his wife and newborn son during childbirth, only the twin sister, also named Paikea, survives.  Her father leaves Paikea to be raised by her grandparents, including the chief of the tribe Koro.  As she grows she learns the Maori traditions, but her grandfather will not allow her to lead the tribe because she is a girl.  He sets out to teach the rest of the young boys the Maori way of life in hopes of finding a new leader.  Paikea is not allowed to attend the training, but secretly observes their sessions.  The final test is when Koro takes the boys into the ocean and challenges them to retrieve the whale tooth he throws in the water, but none of them are successful.  Later Paikea recovers the tooth. It's not until a pod of whales beach themselves, and Paikea is the only person able to coax them back into the water after the entire tribe has tried for hours, that her grandfather finally sees her as the true new Maori leader.<br /><br />The Whale Rider exhibits several features of indigenous religions.  The Maori people held their beliefs and traditions as sacred and they revered whales and their ancestor Paikea above all others.  They were very connected to the land on which they lived because of the legend of Paikea and the whale.  They had many rituals and ceremonies, which included dances and songs.  When in trouble they would chant to the ancestors for guidance.  The Maori acknowledged gender roles by struggling against having a female as their leader.  Young boys were initiated into the tribe by being taught to fight with long sticks.  Whale Rider is an excellent example and an accurate depiction of an indigenous religion for those interested in the learning more about the subject.
B008M34INW|5.0|Any movie starring Mel gibson is an excellent movie. I,ve watch the previews and this caught my attention. Have know idea what movie Mel Gibson will make next
B0001932ZA|5.0|This is a movie that has almost a cult like following. Schwarzenegger is a former cop, that is framed and sent to prison. He becomes a unwilling contestant in 1 of the top rated game show where he has to fight for his freedom or die trying. The game show host is the late, great Richard Dawson (Of Family Feud and Hogan's Heroes). Schwarzenegger fights his way through the battle field and along the way finds the big secret about the game show. It's a good movie with lots of action!
B009329ZF2|2.0|The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because some of the special effects are pretty darn good.  But be warned, this movie is the epitome of cliches, corny dialogue and bad acting.  My stomach turned at least 3 times at how bad the dialogue is in this movie.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|so far so good runnings alittle slow software needs to catch up be not bad. I would reccomend it a hope it stay this way or better
1402270275|4.0|My Rating: 4 stars: Enjoyed - strongly recommend (A-)<br /><br />Kiss of Steel starts the reader off in the middle of Honoria Todd's meager life. It is evident right from the get go that Honoria and her family were living a good life just a mere six months ago, but now they must scrape to make ends meet. She is slowly starving herself to death from malnutrition, she lies to hide the fact that she's living in the slums just so she can keep her job, and her younger brother is very ill. In addition, there is a magnificent bounty on her head, so she must hide her family from those who would turn her in for cash. But all of her hard work didn't keep her from the notice of Blade, the protector of the rookery and provider for the slums. So when Honoria's life takes another turn for the worst, she must turn to Blade, and sell her body for blood to make ends meet.<br /><br />Honoria and Blade are both interesting characters. I enjoyed watching them learn to deal with their lot in life, fighting against stereotypes and falling in love. Their chemistry was fairly hot, at times sensual and at others combative and humorous. Both are strong willed and put others (family) above their own individual needs. I enjoyed how they worked together, and I was entertained by their interchanges and discussions. By the end of Kiss of Steel, the pair had compiled and integrated a good size cast of characters that bodes well for books to come.<br /><br />One of the things I really liked and disliked about Ms. McMaster's storytelling is that she relates the events and tales as if the reader has intimate knowledge of her world. There are no side explanations of her lexicon or creations. The reader must figure out the world by piecing together bits of information and inferring their meanings and importance from dialogue. It makes the story flow faster, but it did make understanding everything a bit difficult at first.  For example, we find out that Blade is a rogue \\"blue blood,\\" and Honoria's brother suffers from the \\"craving virus.\\" We aren't really told what these things are, but based on circumstance I guessed maybe a \\"vampire.\\" However, although the blue bloods drink blood, they are not vampires. It took a while to figure this out, but it mostly did not detract from the enjoyment of the story. However, there were certain times that I did get frustrated and wished I better understood.<br /><br />At one point in the story, Ms. McMaster uses her characters to retell the history of the craving virus, which was used by only the upper class and royalty. Although it started in the far East, it eventually spread across Europe. In some countries, there were uprisings, and the \\"blue bloods\\" were eliminated. However, in England, the Echelon keep a tight fist over those who receive the virus and suppress the masses to keep them in line. Blade is a rogue blue blood, one not born into the Echelon, and escaped their tyranny. He now protects his district, but his name inspires fear to those outside the slums.<br /><br />One key aspect of the craving virus is that after about 50-75 years (my guess based on this book), an infected blood blue loses control over the blood cravings and turns into a mindless vampire.  In order to prevent these killing machines from existing, blue bloods are monitored and their lives ended if they get too close to the Fade (transitioning to vampire). In Kiss of Steel, there is a rogue vampire loose in the slums, and Blade must work with the Echelon to find it. The mystery of where the vampire came from is an interesting one, giving the tale an edge of suspense. And adding to the tension, is Honoria's attempts to find a cure for her brother before he is discovered.<br /><br />I would like to mention that I feel this book is primarily a paranormal romance with a historical setting. The steampunk aspect is very minimal, with little detail about any mechanisms or contraptions. The steampunk is more of an afterthought and not the primary aspect ofthe setting or storyline.<br /><br />Overall I have to say I really enjoyed this story. Although I felt there were some inconsistencies in Blade's character, and I longed for more details at times, the tale kept my interest, and I became invested in the characters. A few open-ended items such as the political ramifications of the ending and the desire to find out more about the side characters and the craving virus, vampires, blue bloods, etc., have me looking forward to reading the second story.the setting or storyline.<br /><br />Overall I have to say I really enjoyed this story.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! So many wonderful finds! Everything from do it yourself projects to planning for a wedding, party or baby! You'll definitely be addicted!
B004UID2LC|5.0|its great but for 2 weeks nothing would play but then it went back to normal. over all it was a great app.
B008OQRULO|5.0|I can't get enough of this series!  I was so upset when I saw the third season already started and it wasnt on demand!  I bought the season pass and I was able to catch up :)
1401923127|1.0|This is just another natureopath/alternative medicine quack using pseudoscience and an incredibly bad understanding of basic quantum mechanical principles to justify his views on alternative medicine.  Energy healing is discredited bunk as is every other practice in this book.  Save your money and go see a real doctor.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a well written book. Even though the main character seemed a bit under developed and immature, the storyline was intriguing and had me hooked from start to finish.  Deborah Harkness did an excellent job of researching and was able to compose a book that had all right elements. I am eagerly awaiting the final novel.
034580404X|5.0|I started reading the first book of the series and it's like I'm addicted to it! :) I can't stop reading it. I am almost done with the first book and I can not wait to continue reading the series. I reccomend this trilogy to anybody that loves to read romance novels, or anybody that just loves to read just about anything!

B004SVM7BW|1.0|My fingers are numb from trying to get the edit icons to reappear after one simple edit.  Steer clear if you are using a Kindle Fire.  Feel like I just flushed $1.99.
B005E94WB0|4.0|Small case that holds the headset well.  Easy to insert and extract. Looks good.  If you are looking for a \\"carrying case\\", this is 5 stars.<br /><br />I wish it was a hard, protective case.  For an office worker or commuter, it is great.  I built a shed wearing it, and wish that it was a hard case in case I accidentally rolled on top of it.  It did a great job, but I did feel like I had to protect it against the construction abuse.
B007SGM084|1.0|I will admit, the first time I read this series I did like it.  I had never read any sort of \\"naughty\\" book in my life.  A friend told me to read it after I finished the Twilight Saga, that this was similar but more realistic and with lots of \\"Mommy porn\\".  I thought I would read it again, and I can barely finish it.  Once you get through the initial shock of the sex, it is a lousy book with poor writing.  Who ever talks about their inner goddess?  And the over use of some words is annoying.  Get a thesaurus!  In book one, we said \\"heady\\" twenty times.  I know this series is pretty trendy now, but just bite the bullet and get a real naughty book if you want.  Or just read the Twilight Saga if you want this same story with vampires and stuff.  This book series sucks.  Ugh.
B00284G2IA|5.0|... and also the last concert of Nightwish together with Tarja Turunen, an event not to be missed!<br />I personally think that both Nightwish and Tarja have lost something from their separation : Nightwish have lost a fabulous voice, Anette (the new singer) is a good singer, but she has a different voice, more 'light' while Tarja with her operatic voice gave a sense of epic in songs like 'Sleeping Sun' or 'Wishmaster'.<br />On the other hand Tarja does not have the same compositional genius than Tuomas Holopainen has and I like her songs less than Tuomas' ones.<br />But let's talk about the concert: 'Dark Chest of Wonders' is a powerful start with keyboards phrasing on a drum-bass-guitar base worthy of the best metal bands, the voice of Tarja completes the epic atmosphere: wonderful !<br />Follows an equally good 'Planet Hell', then the climate changes and move to the sweet notes of the start-up of 'Ever Dream' with the voice of Tarja in evidence, but only for a while: soon it turns into a  fast and powerful song as the previous ones. The following song 'The Kinslayer' is at the same level as the previous but it's in 'The Phantom of the Opera' that Tarja's voice reaches levels unimaginable for many other singers (including Anette): listen to the  end of the song to understand the enormous vocal extension of the singer.<br />The show continues with the excellent 'The Siren', then Tuomas advises the audience to be silent ... you turn on the magic of a 'Sleeping Sun' with the voice of Tarja that creates a unique atmosphere. I've also heard the same song sung by Anette and it is not even comparable ... I do not understand why Nightwish insist in performing live old songs that sound completely different without the magical voice of Tarja.<br />I do not like the next 'High Hopes' : slow and repetitive ... I would not have included it in the show ... but the magical atmosphere is resumed shortly after with 'Bless the Child' followed by a wonderful 'Wishmaster' where Tarja's voice reaches unimaginable heights (listen to the acutes 'Lorien' and 'Starbreeze' of the song ... in the version sung by Anette she is forced to drop her voice to the lower octave ...). Than follows 'Slaying the Dreamer', a song rather 'hard' but nonetheless appreciated and then the wonderful 'Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan', sung in Finnish, with only Tarja on stage in sweet interpretation. The next songs 'Nemo' and 'Ghost Love Score' with its complex beats are wonderful.<br />Then the context changes completely : enters the stage the Indian John Two Hawks for a 'Stone People' played only with voice and flute which leaves me a bit confused ... even if it creates a special atmosphere, it seems a bit boring when compared to the rest of the concert.<br />The next 'Creek Mary's Blood' is much more beautiful : the flute and the voice of John blend with the music of the group and give a great overall effect. The concert ends with 'Over the Hills and far Away' and 'Wish I Had an Angel, a little more catchy songs but pleasant listening.<br />In conclusion ... buy absolutely this DVD or Blue-Ray : you will not regret!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|a well done film. loved to see alan alda as a bad guy. he pulled it off very well. loved the production. ya can't go wrong.
145162607X|4.0|I never can get over reading Philippa Gregory's books.  They are all so fascinating.  The Kingmaker's Daughter kept me so ingrossed, I could not put it down ... a good thing as well as bad.  I read the book in 2-days and now I cannot wait for the next book.  For reading history, Ms. Gregory makes this subject come to light.  She has a talent to make these stories come to actual visual reading.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter shows things back then are not much different than today.  The wealth, the back room dealings, who to bump off and to whom align with to gain power within the Court.  Daughter's are used as pawns and truly have no real value of any sorts.  This book goes into more of what it takes to get what you want.  You think you understand and know what is going to happen next as what else could happen, but then here comes another twist you did not even think of.<br /><br />I give this book 4-star rating as the last chapter was more to introduce the next book.  It was a little confusing and left me with more questions regarding this book as it was like an ending could not be figured out.  I do recommend this book ... enjoy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|liked this one - different story line that continually surprises the reader.  liked the delivery style, as well.  will try this author again.
B00884GR0W|5.0|The only problems are that when you reach Deep Hell I think that's what its called but you cant be there long before you get kicked out of the game. another problem is I had a map where I had built a life sized monuments for 9/11 but it wasn't finished and then I used a bed so I could mine quicker and then I got lost and can't find my monuments. They need a reset for spawning points because mine was right beside the monument.  The only other problem is that the Tnt doesn't work still. these are small problems and all in all this is an awesome game. hint if you want special blocks go out to sea until you find ice then go until you find hundreds of blocks above the ice full of water go into it to find sandstone blocks. I even built Cybertron on a life size scale.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Decent movie, I would say. Good action movie, so-so character development and there is something about Liam Neeaon that I always enjoy in his movies.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I liked this book so much that I went to search for more of her books.I'm all about surprises and happy endings which this book definately had.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This adorable little doll is soft and cuddly. Exactly what we were looking for for our two year old little girl.
1401324649|5.0|I ordered this English version for my husband to read because I enjoyed reading it so much in French, I could hardly put it down. Yes, it's entertaining, funny and stretches the imagination. Just go along for the ride and don't question its realism.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was great when I needed to relax after a busy day. Its not a book that will be remembered for ever or taught in schools by any means. But it was very entertaining and I have suggested it to many friends and coworkers.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Great movie!  Very uplifting.  It's a good movie the whole family can enjoy.  My husband has probably seen it 20 or more times and he's not a big movie viewer.  It's rare to find a movie you can be comfortable watching with younger kids and not feel bored.  This is very entertaining for every age!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best app ever. I use it all the time and it never lets me down. try it today. you won't be sorry.
B005M2A4D4|2.0|For me, Series 6 was somewhat disappointing, and much different from the previous sets of series. In my opinion, there is much too much focus on the 3-4 main characters. In previous editions, there were some great storylines centered around new worlds and the types of people who lived there. I hope the series gets back to that direction. Cheers!
B00772M1F6|5.0|Totally original, love the style and is the best money i've ever spent. Can't say enough good things about JD McPherson. Gonna be a big time STAR.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not what I expected. I was embarrassed to read this book after a few chapters and quickly deleted it from my Kindle. I was not expecting graphic details.
0385483821|3.0|Andrew Grove does a really nice job of presenting the story of Intel and others in the context of his 'strategic inflection point' idea. I thought the book was well-written, insightful, and engaging.<br /><br />I started to get a little bored in the second half of the book though. In all fairness, the book was written 16 years before I read it. That is, it would have been really good (five stars) if I had read it then. Sixteen years later, I still found it to be worth reading -- but the stars start to fade over time.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I really enjoyed Percy Jackson and the Olympians but I wish that the book would have been written. I enjoyed reading about the different greek gods but more details would have been nice. But all in all this was a good book I look forward to the second,third, and fourth.
B00004ZBVG|3.0|This is a great production ranking up there with \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" types. Certain facts were changed slightly and there were cuts removed from the original version. But with the star line up, I always enjoy seeing this overall winner again and had to have a copy of my own.<br />Thank you<br />H. Velez, Florida USA
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The best book i've read in a while.  Delightful and a page turner. Really enjoyed the way it was written. The time lines really kept your interest. The story telling was superb.
0345803485|1.0|I have to admit, I was very excited about reading this book and was determined to like it, but my resolve quickly faded. I cannot believe that this got published!!! I feel like I want to demand a refund and sue for damages. I love romance and can tolerate a great deal of sugar coated escapism, but this book is beyond fifty shades of pathetic.<br /><br />Firstly - the writing. How on earth did no one edit this? Did no one proof read this and realize that Ana says \\" oh my\\" or \\"down there\\" a million times! Which college graduate talks about \\"down there\\"??? Plus, if I EVER read a book containing an \\"inner goddess\\" or a characterized \\"subconscious\\" again,  I will go completely insane.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that there is absolutely NO storyline, whatsoever. I can summarize the story:<br />Annoying college girl meets insanely rich guy, she gets over her initial shyness, they have sex, she goes from virgin to sex-crazed nympho, they talk and email ENDLESSLY about the details of the sex they plan to have, he beats her, she leaves.<br /><br />The second book:<br />They both try to convince the other one that they are not worthy of each other, a crazy ex-sub occurs as a sub-plot with absolutely no impact on the main story, Christian's first lover tries to convince him that Ana is not for him, Christian proposes to Ana.<br /><br />Third book:<br />They marry, contrived \\"suspense\\" occurs with Ana's former employer, they have lots of sex and children, THE END (thankfully!!!)<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that anyone in their 20's can be a self-made billionaire who never works, but then again he needs the time to have so much sex. I also find his constant nagging of Ana to eat weird (maybe THAT's the porn - a man telling a girl to EAT). Not to mention the fact that he knows the detail of her birth control pills - seriously, unless the man's a gynae, who has ever come across a guy who reminds you to take your pill????<br /><br />I really, really wish I could eradicate the sex scenes from my memory,  because it's not erotic, it's disturbing. I am all for provocative reading, but I am way to conservative to find a man who enjoys hurting women a turn-on. I also feel that for the woman to subject herself to this, she, her subconscious and inner goddess are in dire need of therapy. Not to mention the fact that he was seduced into the 'lifestyle' by an older woman when he was 15!!!! Am I the only person out there who finds that wrong on so many levels?????<br /><br />The characters are unbelievable, the writing is TERRIBLE, there is absolutely no plot. Anyone who enjoys this must be fifty shades of stupid!!! The cover art used on the books are fabulous, but one can clearly not judge a book by its cover.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  I love pinterest but it was always so small on the Fire but this app solved that problem!!
B00932A2MC|3.0|It was a good rental but would have been mad if I saw it in theater. It's no Transformers and some parts are a bit corny.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Still my favorite of the popular books right now. The bad boy (you have to love) and the good girl saving each other from their own lives, tastefully written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this was my expression when I found it! :D :D :D :D!!!! oh my God ive been waiting for this app for three freaking months! :D :D
0345803485|1.0|After hearing so much hype about this book in the media, I decided it was time to find out for myself what all the hype was about.  Total waste of my time and money.  Should have taken the other negative views written to heart.<br /><br />Don't bother wasting your money.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Definitely reduced the amount of space needed for us to play Kinect games, probably by around 2 feet.  Also, better tracking of child-size players.  Game performance was much improved for some Kinect games (e.g., Wreckateer), while for others not so much or perhaps slightly worse (e.g., Fruit Ninja).  But, it's easy to take the Zoom on and off if needed.  I think it's worth the moderate price if you use Kinect a fair amount and are having some space or child-size player issues.  I have the Kinect below my TV.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Loved this book. All three books of Stieg Larsson's trilogy were great, but this one would have been my favourite.<br /><br />Worth reading!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle game with a variety of choices to make it as easy or as hard as you want it. Puzzles are bright and colorful. A nice selection of freebies and a ton of pay fors reasonably priced. Almost as good as the real cardboard cut out puzzles but you don't. need to worry about space.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my collection specifically because it is both heartwarming and really funny at the same time.  The minions are hilarious throughout the entire film and it just melts your heart to see how the 3 little girls from the orphanage change an evil villain into a really caring father figure.  I consider this a must-have movie for when you need some cheering up.
B008133MDK|5.0|This new season of a modern day setting Sherlock features again a remarkable cast, and sadly few episodes.  It really leaves you wanting more.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|You know it's funny when purchasing the latest albums by artists like The Beach Boys, or The Stones or even McCartney, you always unfairly compare it to their best records. But Dylan is a completely different animal to the one that released music in the 60's, 70's or even 1980's. I think this particular phase of his recording career started in the early 1990's with the \\"As Good..\\"/\\"World gone Wrong\\" folk albums.<br />After the relative failure of \\"Together through Life\\" (he's done a lot worse in his career), we have a welcome return to form.<br />Fascinating lyrics, great melodies (I don't think he always gets the credit he deserves for this) & a real good mix of light and dark moods.<br />Stronger that \\"Modern Times\\" & \\"Together through life\\", but not quite as good as \\"Love & Theft\\" & \\"Time out of mind\\". So in the middle then.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found the story to be very interesting and a good read. I like many other women seem to have an ingrained need to \\"tame\\" the \\"wild\\" or \\"bad boy\\".  This story also helps you to look at your own love life and what you have, and or what you want or need.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have the first two books in paperback form, because I love actually having the book (emphasis on \\"having\\") in my hands, and when I first began high school I began reading A Game of Thrones but because I was 15 I was too young to understand everything that went on in the book. But I finished it last summer and had to buy Clash of Kings immediately to start it and I just finished it on my Kindle a day or so ago. My cousin has been tracking my progress through the books (I was reading a Dany chapter and translated what I thought about what happened to him about it and he said, \\"I didn't think of that!\\") He has told me Storm of Swords IS the longest book (dang) but Feast for Crows is the shortest. So I have been forewarned. And Catelyn's chapters take me like five hours and a lot of whining. And she is NOTHING compared to Davos, who takes me days. I read other books just to skip over his chapters. I've been thinking of re-reading Game of Thrones, just because I love the series. &lt;3
6305181810|2.0|Great casting, good courtroom drama.<br /><br />The trouble is that the movie needlessly revises and weakens a superb novel, and I compare the result with the novel. What business did the script-writer have ruining the original?
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|It's easier to use than it looks! It takes little to no time to read the directions and get started. I was very pleased with the G2 and I am off cutting glass everywhere! Thanks
B0064BWDRW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Phantom\\" and found it to be up to Jo Nesbo's usual standard in terms of the story line.Those who love the Harry Hole character will be sad to find that in the final pages of the book Harry appears to have met his maker. Or has he? Guess we'll have to wait until or if Jo Nesbo writes another installment.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really loved this show. I have watched both season 1 and 2 so far. Cant wait for season three. Please hurry amazon.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|There are many reviews complaining about the accuracy if this watch.  Did you guys know the movement is adjustable?  Look at the see-through back and you can see a dial with a +/- next to it. After some experimental adjusting, I have this watch keeping almost perfect time for the three weeks that I have been checking on it.  You don't have to accept gaining or losing minutes a day and just chalk it up to owning a cheap automatic watch when you can fix it yourself.  Size and design are perfect for me as I have small wrists and don't like the humongous watch look. Definitely does not seem like a sub-$100 watch let alone a Seiko.  I've only had it for about a month so I hope durability holds up.  Overall incredible value for the money.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This movie was so long and hard to follow because there is a drawn out slow motion action scene every 20 seconds.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I was very pleased with the shipping and the DVD! This was an awesome season and hilighly reccomend it to all the Dexter fans out there!
B005HHSXP0|5.0|My son brought this book home. He is not the best reader so needs a little help. At first glance I was nearly going to tell him to put it away. However, upon opening the book I was extremely pleased. This book is fantastic, a great read - even for Mums. My son thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love how this story is unfolding and can't wait to find out the ending. It has a great twist in it that I wasn't expecting.  I loved the book but hated the ending!
B008X77K8W|5.0|I can't believe nobody has reviewed this album yet on Amazon. It's not lacking by any means though I'm sorry it took so many years since his last effort! Stand-out tracks to me are \\"You Lie When You Call My Name,\\" \\"Low Down Ramblin' Blues,\\" and \\"The Lonesome Way.\\" To be completely honest I could do without \\"Hard Edges,\\" and \\"Jack Loved Jesse\\" but they're by no means bad songs. I downloaded the mp3 version of the album at 12:01AM, immediately after it became available but I sure would like some liner notes. Digital booklet would be a great addition.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not for the super intellectual reader.  The book was for pure entertainment purposes.  Total fantasy.  A \\"super sexy get away from it all\\" read.
0439023491|4.0|The more I think about it, the more I realize that this book really is excellent... the only down-side is that it doesn't *quite* match up to its predecessor, The Hunger Games. I came away from this one thinking \\"not that great\\", but then as I pondered it for a few days after, I realized my initial opinion was just because I was so blown away by The Hunger Games.<br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />This story took much longer to get moving; there was a lot of time before Katniss and Peeta finally went back into the arena. And although the book is still a page-turner, there's a sense of anticlimax, I felt, because we've ALREADY been in the arena. Although the reason it happens makes sense... it also felt a bit 'repeat'. I wanted something new. Also, the mix of characters wasn't as strong as in the first book. Having all kids in the arena was a horrifying, can't-look-away nail-biter; but with Katniss and Peeta being the youngest, and the eldest character back in the arena an old lady, it gave it a very different feel.<br />Also I hate to say this, because I LOVED the character of Katniss in the first book, but she seemed to have lost a bit of her edge in this one. Again, maybe that's just by comparison...<br />However, for all that the above sounds negative, this is still a GREAT book and Suzanne Collins is a SUPERB writer. I'm hoping the third book picks back up again... but this one still gets four stars! (Actually I'd probably give it 4.5 if I could; just not the 5 I gave The Hunger Games).<br />And I do hate it when a book ends on a cliffhanger! But that's to be expected for most trilogies I guess.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie was a visual feast. I was surpised to adore Kristen Stewart in this film. The entire cast was magnificent; the cinematography and costumes were nothing short of stunning. I wept at the beauty of it, on so many levels.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like puzzles, you will really enjoy Magic Puzzles.<br />Alot of fun and haven't experienced any of the problems listed on some other reviews.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is such a glorious film.  It is nice to have a good story and competent actors to play the well-written roles.  It is also nice to have a movie with \\"elders' in it, still showing they have \\"it\\".  The British cast is stellar.  I have seen the film 3 times, and a friend has seen it 6!  It poses some questions we all must face -- what to do with our lives when we become an elder.  The sets and the scenery (India) are entrancing with plenty of true customs thrown in.  It also has young love in it, so I can say anyone would enjoy this film. I enjoyed the film far more than the book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Everything is great about this game... The gameplay is smooth and fun, the music is perfect and is very addicting!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The selection of sounds and combinations that can be made with the volume of each sound being delectable give the user a vast number of options.  The interface is easy to use.  I had fun trying different combinations and was delighted to find I can now gently drift off to sleep to the sound of gentle rain on the roof of a tent and the remains of a campfire slowly burning down outside.
B0091LRZZW|4.0|I too saw the abbreviated version of \\"Live Kisses\\" on PBS and, while it was enjoyable I thought the complete, unedited version of the performance which was previously available on I-Tunes was superior. I thought Paul's difficulty in whistling his part in \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\" was endearing and was sorry to see it cut from the PBS show. I was hoping that the complete, uncut performance would be part of the bonus material but, alas, it appears it is not. That is a shame. I will purchase this DVD because the collection of musicians on the album are amazing. To see them perform these, sometimes unknown classics with such professional perfection is more than worth the price. If I had one other complaint it is that these songs get in to your head and you find yourself singing or whistling them all day long.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It has proved to be very handy. I use it often. when I am useing other software that has its owe calculator I prefer this app open on my desk top.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This book, repackaged as an app, is undoubtedly one of the greatest works of fiction of all time. It has millions of people fooled into believing that it is an actual historical record. Do not buy unless you consider yourself an enlightened individual, as it is highly misleading.
B0091VTISO|2.0|I've been a fan of REH since boyhood, in particular the Conan stories.  As a fan, I was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation. Well................ I just finished watching it and, to say the least, I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Character development was basically non-existent. The plot was shallow. AND to make matters worse, Conan is not portrayed as the biggest, baddest, strongest cat around. Conan gets his butt kicked one-on-one several times in this movie.  Talk about a departure from Howard's vision.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a firsthand account of alias Mark Owen's Navy SEAL training and his entry into the special group of DEVGRU that killed Osama Bin Laden. The book covers several missions prior to Mark's ultimate task including his growing up in Alaska.<br /><br />The book is written simply and does not expose anything beyond what is read in the papers (though a few details due differ) and from reading other books about Navy SEALs.<br /><br />What's interesting is the number of one star reviews from people who obviously did not read the book. One SEAL apparently unhappy about Owen's success stated that Mark should never talk about the SEALs, which is interesting since there are other books that go into more detail than this one.<br /><br />I didn't find this book as entertaining as Unbroken because the writing was dry and could've had more depth, but overall, the book is interesting and gives good details of the assault on Bin Laden.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is really steamy and erotic if u like that kind of stuff. Can't wait till the second book comes out.
B0011Z8SPW|5.0|I really do like this album, my two favorite  are; 'The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage' and 'I write sins not tragedies'. I haven't listened to any other album but I do suggest this one :) go listen to the whole songs on YouTube if you're not sure about it yet.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it worked great until recently.  now like others have said it won't download bringing up an error notice about speed whig is bogus I can tootle outbreak and play anything I want.<br />this has been reported yet nothing being disappointed in amazon for not correcting
B007S3S8HO|3.0|We bought this four our Angry Birds obsessed four year old, along win the AB Space set too..<br />The box says 5 and up, but he plays Legos all the time and felt he was ready.<br /><br />As we are putting it together, I noticed they had you place a lot of blank pieces that cover only one connection point.  This is to allow it to come apart easier when it gets hit by a bird, but it makes it extremely aggravating when trying to put the thing together. Also, if assembled as instructed, a swift breeze could knock it down.<br /><br />I modified this by choosing not to use the small tiles that cover connection points, making it way more enjoyable!
B00846REIS|5.0|I think I got to work late for a whole week because I couldn't put this book down at night. Very similar to 50 shades, but with its own twist, GOOD READ!! Im waiting on the second book, already on pre-order.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|At first listen I wasn't sure about this one.  Of course his voice has been shot for a number of years and on Tempest I felt it was really bad and took away from the songs.  Also, the songs don't seem to flow as well as the ones on say Modern Times, for example.  But, upon repeated listens I really love this album.  It has great lyrics (as usual) and it just fits with what his overall sound has become.  I think that his voice is best when he sings the more ballad like songs such as Soon After Midnight or Scarlet Town, it loses the gravel.  I saw him in concert about 3 weeks ago and Tempest is reminicent of his sound I remembered in concert.
B007EC27QM|5.0|who said small keys, wonder what they consider big. This calculator ls easy to use and easy to see plus keeps a running total if you need to go back to check any possible errors. Great app highly recommend for basic math.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I liked the movie better on the big screen, but it was okay. Of course Robert Downey Jr was ridiculous as usual an couldn't be beat! I was glad that they left it \\"open-ended\\" so we can watch out for another one in the future> Sherlock is one of my best characters, whoever plays him.<br />The movie arrive as promised an in excellent condition.
0439023513|5.0|I have been so sucked into the world of Hunger Games.  No other series of books has ever kept me so captivated.  I never wanted the story to end.  This 3rd book was just a wonderful as the previous two and had so many great twists that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  The level of detail in this author's writing is just incredible.  I wanted to be in the story line fighting right next to the rebels so bad!!  The ending was great...I wasn't expecting it but was absolutely perfect.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Ev's new album really shows how much Amy's voice has grown and how much more confident the band is in playing harder songs. The lyrics still capture that same vulnerability and demand for more, but in an entirely new way! Definitely worth listening to, every song grows on you! I don't normally like when bands head in a new direction, but this is just masterful.
B006RXPUR2|2.0|I decide to rent this on a whim after hearing an acquaintance call it one of the best films he's ever seen.  Big mistake.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone plays out like a beefed up whodoneit made for the big screen.  I say 'beefed up' in the sense that the writers/producers needed to add an overwhelming number of plot twists to take its basic storyline from the level of Hallmark Channel Original to Major Motion Picture status.  This movie has plot twists for the sake of plot twists.  While I can say that this movie DID keep my attention for the full 2 hours, I only give it 2/5 stars instead of 3 because the last plot twist is so unbelievably stupid and farfetched that it's a slap in the face to the viewer that just invested 2 hours of his/her time in this.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|If my cat could type, I would expect just these sorts of communications from her.  Looking at her now, I realize that<br />the author has channeled her inner thoughts to paper for my benefit and that of other cat owners(?).  More importantly,<br />cats have now been given a voice to add to their already aloof, regal postures.  The words are an excellent adjunct<br />to the photos included in the book. I highly recommend this as a quick, fun read and a must for those of us who aren't<br />quite sure what's going on behind those bright eyes.<br /><br />A note of caution...I downloaded this book to my Kindle Fire.  I was not sure if the photos, in color on my Fire,<br />would come across as well on my original Kindle.  To my surprise, although it was listed in that Kindle's arhived items list,<br />I was greeted with a message that this item was not compatible with the original Kindle when I tried to download it there.  Hmmm...
B008MG1E4A|1.0|This book made me wish Amazon would introduce negative stars. I have to admit i purchased it out of sheer curiosity about the men that ultimately carried out this historic operation.<br /><br />First it is written like a 15 year old on steroids wrote it.<br />Second, it's the total opposite of the silent dignity most past service members exhibit.<br />But the worst part is the Anti-Obama rhetoric that really makes you wonder if this is not a political item after all. The anti-Obama rhetoric first feels like a fly coming on your screen during an action movie. It then escalates to a ridiculously petty level at the end of the book where Mark Owen goes to great lenght to say that \\"the Seals don't like Obama\\", \\"Obama will take credit for this\\", \\"WE just got Obama reelected\\" \\"Obama took credit for the Captain Philips rescue\\" and the most hilarious \\"Obama promised to offer us a beer at the white house and did not\\". Bla, bla, Bla.<br />I'm not an Obama fan but geeee!!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Processor was used for my first desktop build.  Came in, was easy to install.  Stock cooler was easy to mount.  So far, I haven't stressed in super much, but it's handled absolutely everything I've done with it.  Regression analysis in Excel with around 100,000 variables?  Didn't break a sweat.  Call of Duty?  Come on.  This thing handles most anything with ease.  For the price, you can't beat it.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I ordered this product because the ad made it look pretty good. I returned it because it was nothing more than a flimsy plastic cover that offered no real protection for my kindle fire whatsoever.
B005I548B4|3.0|Any easy read. Typical formula for NS.  Supernatural elements always a little odd. A little far fetched at the end, but it's escapism and it was perfect to while away a rainy day.
B007SGM084|5.0|Was nice having the books all together. Was not able to put down and was able to just go right into the next.
B008K8U13K|4.0|I have this on andriod but I'm sure the outdated interface works as well on kindle. it's a good game but its for a new player or really devoted fan. the game isn't much of a jump from the old genesis games. I still enjoyed it but it suffered those &quot;really that killed me moments&quot; sonic players know what I'm talking about a spot that's too sudden or a slightly glitchy boss. tails and knuckles aren't here at all but no worries it carries itself without them.<br />enjoy it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my best book of the trilogy.  I enjoyed the writing style and it is really a woman's book.  I wish I were younger to go through a lot of those things again.  Thoroughly enjoyed her discriptive expressions.  Have recommended to all my female friends.  (Men could learn a lot from some of Christian's skills)
B004I9CXHW|5.0|I'm using this in a 2012 vw GTI, with the standard (non-navigation) radio system. It works very well. I plugged in a usb flash drive and my music is waiting for me every time I turn on my car. At first, I had some difficulty with it, but then I realized that the flash drive was at fault! With another flash drive, I've been doing very well. I think the problem with the other flash drive was that it was coming slightly loose over time. I suppose that a piece of tape could fix this if absolutely necessary. Anyways, the socket is a nice firm fit with no wobbling or cheap feel to it.<br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S. this is so much easier than hooking up the iphone every time, or using the bluetooth audio. With this, you get song titles and all of the other data. I don't get that with the bluetooth.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this weather app because it is quick and simple to use. works well on my kindle fire. I think its easier to use than the Weather Channel app.
B000002LBH|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this album- it is an incredible double album that takes you through so many sounds and emotions. Growing up, the Smiths were one of my favorites- the lyrics and music just captured everything I was feeling so poignantly and now that I am a little older, I find that the Smiths still hold a special place in my heart and my music library.
0788859544|5.0|The Little Mermaid DVDs were terrific and brought back many memories. The DVDs arrived fast and perfect.  The whole process of ordering and receiving was flawless.
B004I744AS|5.0|If I had this when I was in college I would have gotten better grades. What fun to have it now.
B008DVJO8C|2.0|I've read the reviews raving how metal and awesome this cd is.  Ha!  It's far from the metal they have been playing.  Take The Dream and make it poppy and more radio friendly and that's what this cd is.  It starts off with the obvious radio single \\"Blood\\" and it's so repetitive that it's kind of annoying.  I listened to the first 7 tracks and turned it off because I was so bored with the lackluster songs. The cd sounds like something Lacuna Coil or Evanescence would put out.  I loved Star Crossed Wasteland!  One of my favorite cd's of all time!  This one, shelved. I'll pass it down to my kids, if I ever figure out how to make them and have some, if they ask me for it.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Good concept and lots of imagination used.  Easy to watch several times.<br />great costumes and sets.  I'm looking forward to the follow up movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its a easy app to use can find many pictures or random things that could be hard to find by other means
B004U52VPS|2.0|My brother has three kids and I have two.  Christmas 2011, my mother bought this game for the grand kids, and it was up to me to help them play this, building the set pieces and then knock them down.<br /><br />It was a traumatizing experience.<br /><br />First off, good luck actually building the structures as designed by the cards.  The pieces are shaped weird, and it's difficult to get them set up according to the structure.<br /><br />Second, it takes longer to get everything set up then for the kids to knock the structure down.  Oh, and the score?  Well, who knows how to do that, because half the time you're struggling to get the structure set up according to the design picture.<br /><br />The game comes with two birds, the yellow and the red.  Both have different dimensions and weights, so there is some difference in the way they fly thru the air with the slingshot.  For a kid's game the product seems well made.<br /><br />My experience with the game was we'd get the structures set up loosely, they'd knock it down, and then you'd spend a lot of time rebuilding.  Can't say I'm a fan.  The kids liked the game to some extent, but honestly if you're going to get a game go with something else.  This is just a hassle and a cash in on the Angry Birds craze.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this because I upgraded to a new DSLR but wanted to carry around my old one, (as a backup,) and accessories comfortably. I started looking at camera bags and I was surprised how much they cost in stores. Naturally I hopped on Amazon.com looking for a better deal. I found the AmazonBasics Camera Bag and decided to buy it. So far so good, I really like the back overall. Plenty of storage in the main compartment for both cameras (one with a lens installed and one without), plus 3 more lenses, batteries and chargers. I was able to stick my 13in Macbook in the flap compartment in front and it almost fully fit, (if only I could afford a Macbook Air.) I think the only way I would like this back more is if the front flap opened to the side, (like a suitcase,) instead of folding down. If the pockets in the front aren't zipped when you open the flap all the way things tend to slide out.<br /><br />I'm by no means a professional photographer but this bag makes me feel a little more professional at least! A great buy at a great price. Thanks Amazon!
B0033AX1YG|5.0|I love Gary Moore . He had the best tone , style , voice , etc. that was the real deal to me ,  and I've listened to a lot of BLUES since starting out on guitar in '65 with Jimmy Reed . His passing was a great shock and loss. This DVD set from Montreux is the ultimate thrill left for his legion of fans world wide . Crank it up and enjoy the changes he went through at the different shows over the years . PEACE
B000002KHH|5.0|Comments on the $4.99 CD of this Album:<br /><br />Who Cares what Covers they have? Apparently a lot , especially when the title changes.This edition I bought is a<br />cheaper version basically because the double disc remaster and remix is coming out, or is out. Thankfully the new<br />sets have great mixes, and great extras. The notes have anonymous comments , essentially, but probably seem to add<br />a little bit. For the price I paid, its pretty good. However, I will probably wind up with several versions of this<br />CD/Album set. So far, the albums I enjoyed on Vinyl have been superb on CD, and great on remaster. In some cases,<br />with special editions having multiple versions, I can get 2 to 4 or more versions of the same albums and not just<br />because I collect and want to re-sell, but because I love getting the cool extras, like with the vinyls with the<br />extras, or with the ACDC multiple disc sets with 3 audio discs, and 2 DVDs ( Same with some Artists who have<br />special editions done in 5.1 ). I enjoy CD packs. One thing I think that would be very cool is replica Sabbath<br />ACCESS ALL AREAS passes. But the main reason is the music. I have always called this music Hard rock, as I heard<br />Tony Iommi say, but Rock, Metal or Butter milk Polka, if its Sabbath, etc., I'll try and get it !!! See my pictures I added from two different editions of this CD... one is the US edition an one is a \\"cheap\\" Aus Edition, but has some neat content in the booklet.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|my favorite author. Funny and easy to read, easy flows. I have read her every book and never got tired. Find all her books light and entertaining.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Honestly, this is the best show that was ever made for TV and it only lasted one season. I am gutted that they cancelled it all these years later. I am sure the studio is still kicking themselves over that unfortunate call and likely fired the studio exec that made that bone-headed decision. This series has made them a lot of money in DVD sales. It now has a cult following and they could have made so much more money off of the show had they just stuck with it another season or two to let the show build a following. It was, and still is, one of the most realistic shows ever made. Not just with the kids, but the adults in the series as well.<br /><br />For those of you that have been living under a rock and somehow managed to miss this series through the years, I'll give a quick run down of the basics. The main character is Angela, a 15 year old introvert who is obsessed, to the point of distraction, with Jordan, a handsome slacker who leans against things in the most appealing way. Her new bestfriends are Rayanne and Ricki, grunge kids that take her from wallflower to weirdo-hip-chick in record speed, leaving her former bestie Sharon in the dust. Her neighbor Brian, the brain of the school, is obsessed with Angela, unbeknownst to her, bringing the love-fest, teenage-angst style, full circle. Surrounded by the kids drama are the different parents who are all struggling with their own issues as well, and all of these plot lines are treated with respect and realism as well. The parents and adults in the show aren't treated as just filler here, they are well rounded characters with their own sub-plots playing out.<br /><br />What was so unique about this show is the brilliant writing and the brave story lines. The covered issues range from teen alcoholism, homosexuality, guns in the school, low self esteem, teen sex, homelessness, to parental infidelity. Even a Grateful Dead show and Kurt Cobain's suicide show up! My So-Called Life was ahead of its time for its realisticapproach to the story lines. Most everyone in the audience will be able to relate to at least one of the characters in a very real, authentic way. The show truly was pure genius!

B0034G4P9E|5.0|GREEEEEAT freaken movie!!!!!! It has action, drama, the whole nine. I really, really thoroughly enjoyed this. I looooove Tom Hardy. A must see!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey was recommended to me by a couple friends, but I'm not usually one for period pieces or soap operas.  Downton Abbey is neither. Instead I was very happy to discover that it's a very intelligent drama in which the characters' stories evolve within the complex historical, cultural, and social realities of England in the decade before, during, and immediately after World War I. The characters are believable and complex, and the acting is superb!  I highly recommend this series for everyone.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|Enjoyed being able to catch up on the series, which is one of my favorites.  I don't have a DVR, so I do not record the series as it happens.<br />Looking forward to Season Five when it is released.  Good DVD's,  only one or two minor glitches, but they were brief.  Thank You.
030758836X|5.0|Being an avid reader of all types of novels I thought I had seen everything.  This story beats them all.  I did hate the foul language and thought it was mostly unnecessary.  The story itself (I'm sure other reviewers have given the highlights so I won't) keeps you on the edge of your seat and at the end you are torn between saying 'This could never happen' and knowing that there are people in this world just crazy enough to make it happen.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story about dysfunctional people.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game. think fast or the computor will get you. It gives you a break from regular solitaire. Be sure to downstack your piles or you will get caught.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I confess, I haven't bought this album, but I have listened to \\"Somebody that I used to know\\" many times in my car. At first, I thought STING put out a new album. Guess I'll have to listen to a few more songs before I commit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|NICE! VERY GLAD I FOUND THIS LITTLE GEM! it's. very easy to use and remembers what you just did without having to input it back in!
B0076UXKDG|4.0|After purchasing two after market grips and returning them I reluctantly purchased the OEM version on Amazon. It came down to quality and ability to protect your investment. I use a BlackRapid strap which uses the tripod screw to support the camera. With the two non OEM grips I had great concerns with the ability of the grips to support carrying a $3000 camera. Comparing the Nikon to the non OEM grips the nikon used screw rather than glue to assemble the grip. I gave the Nikon 4 starts dinging them only on the price. Price gouging is not cool but they know they have a superior product and notghing after market comes close from a quality perspective. Beware of the non OEM grips if you use a BlackRapid.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book had surprising plot twists, it was an easy read, and definitely a page turner.  would recommend to anyone who likes action, murder, mystery, and twists.
B006F8HZYK|1.0|It says illustrated, in my table of contents, but it is not.  I only purchased this to have the illustrated version.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle fire and have never had any problems with it. It's so nice being able to browse whenever I have a free minute or ten :-)
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I purchased this & it worked fine the first few transfers. After that i quit. I had missed the return date by a few days, and my e-mail to Amazon about the problem was first misunderstood, they thought I hadn't received it. When I corrected that, I never heard from them again.<br />  I would like to know it there is any warranty, but haven't been able to find it.<br /><br />Not expensive, but annoying as it should work, especially since it's specific to the fire.<br /><br />I ended up getting a universal, from a foreign vendor, and it works perfectly. It was also cheaper.<br /><br />AOM
0062119044|4.0|This was a great book. Interesting topic and exploration of family dynamics. At times, a little wordy, but I would definitely recommend it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in years.  It will definitely touch you inside and make you want to reconnect with your family.  Bring a hankie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed this multi-faceted twist of fate with a different level of suspense around every corner.<br />If I ever need to plot revenge against persons or situations in my life I will take advice from this<br />author.
