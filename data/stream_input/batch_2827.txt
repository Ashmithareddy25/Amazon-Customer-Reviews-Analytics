B002SAS26E|5.0|You take on the roles of greedy Indian merchants trying to outdo each other to become the Maharajah's personal trader. This is a light, simple to learn 2-player resource trading game that you can teach in five minutes and be done with in twenty. And yet the game is fantastically balanced and requires careful thought, planning, and strategy. Most games are just a few points apart. You can try it for free online at Board Game Arena. Once you try it, you'll be hooked. This will be a game you'll be playing for years, great for couples, and great for quick filler between other games (I also recommend [[ASIN:B000ARTT7S Guillotine]] for that, which works for 2-5 players). The artwork, box, and components are all beautiful and durable. Best of all, the cards are pre-shuffled and the pogs are pre-punched and pre-sorted! Everything is ready to play right out of the box. Zero effort required. Nice!<br /><br />I found some rules to increase the number of players to 3 or 4 over at Jaipur's page on Boardgame Geek.<br /><br />For 3 Players: Deal out 4 cards, hand limit 6. Game ends with 4 coin colors depleted. No end for cards, just shuffle the discard pile when needed.<br /><br />For 4 Players: Deal out 3 cards, hand limit 5. Game ends with only 1 coin colors remaining. No end for cards, just shuffle the discard pile when needed.<br /><br />PS: Another two player foreign merchant game (this time with an African theme) that is worth checking out is [[ASIN:B0009QYT5W Jambo]].
B005PK57IK|5.0|I continue to think that this is one of the best written, best acted and best conceived show on TV
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I really like this series. Being inside the heroine's head is interesting and I admire her.  The structure of the society was also interesting. I love a good love triangle, even though this one totally stresses me out. I look forward to the conclusion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic game for anyone who loves puzzles. No problems with downloading or anything. I really want them to make another game it so that amazing
B006LXQID8|5.0|Love it every time I see it. Great characters and Audrey Tautou is adorable. I'll probably watch it again in a month or two.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|this issue a great game if you like tcgs, if you don't then you probably wont like it. you might like it if you like stretegic board games as well
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and adicting. I like hidden objects but get tired of always solving a crime. This is a good game for the whole family.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works very well. I use it for many things. Terrific addition to the Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a functional alarm.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wake up on time its great everyone should get it I love it I just great I don't know wat else to say its just great
B00CSFXR6E|4.0|Because the higher res digital files where used you get a bit fuller sound from this vinyl version than you do from the cd version. Not to bad sounding at all.
B00CATSONE|2.0|At first, I was just curious about Nicola Tesla, but this author scripted his story in such an interesting style, I could not put the book down. He made me see that one really has to have imagination and the capacity to bring about to reality what one envisions to succeed. Persistence, courage, and Tesla's courage brought his ideas to reality. Thanks for penning this book Sean, I never thought I would enjoy reading it.
B00CU7ZMRW|4.0|Sound a little better and more full than the cd version. I was pleased to get a quiet copy and have enjoyed hearing some of the older songs again.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|My whole family loves it!  The music is well done and the plot moves along to each song very well.
B00CIH371W|4.0|The Tegen Cave by Inge-Lise Goss<br /><br />All Sara Jones wants to do is get away. She doesn't know who to trust. And now on top of that spiders are killing people. But where are the spiders coming from and why do they always revolve around her.<br /><br />Tegen Cave is a splendid story that will keep you interested from beginning to the end.  It's an exceptional story that will always leave you wondering what will happen next. It has adventure, excitement, murder, love, lost and then found.<br /><br />I have never read one of Inge-Lise Goss stories before but will absolutely read more. I found her imaginatively, very unique and original, which into day's world is not easy to do because everything had been done before.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about the book is I wish there was a little more action after Sara gain her new abilities.<br /><br />A must read.<br /><br />Patricia Foltz<br />Way2Kool Design Review<br /><br />4 stars
B009WUBERW|2.0|I liked the first Expendables and wanted to like this one but I found it boring with no plot. I turned it off half way thru because I just couldn't watch it anymore
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up was easy and it works effortlessly. NOW!  Bring on the additional apps Google! Great gadget at a price that everyone can afford. Very happy with this purchase. Well done Google!
B00004W221|5.0|Perfect example of any ordinary man can do extraordinary things. Fantastic movie, I recommend this to anyone who believes that in hard work, comes results. And if you don't believe it, then maybe this movie will help you see that, seeing that it was based on Dan Ruettiger's real life story. RUDY RUDY RUDY!
0385341008|5.0|So many books are interesting, but depressing. This book was a delight to read and easy to imagine that these people<br /> would be brave enough to come up with a way to protect themselves from an enemy and find a way to better connect with their neighbors.
B00785P2QC|5.0|you've got to get this game its great hope you like it alot loop pool plop loop poop loop loop loop
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it!! You should get this game it is like halo it is super fun!!!!!!!
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I really like the weather app I think it is a good app to have it lets you know what exactly what the weather is
1575666286|5.0|Easy read. You can skim through it and take what you want & read it cover to cover. Theres receipts as well to follow the diet.
B001VNB54A|3.0|It's a nice story....I'd prefer one but there are several main characters.<br />Can't compare to band of Brothers. WIll watch only once.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|If you like southern locations cool leads and cracking drama,you'll love this movie!..Mathew McConaughey rocks in this one..a modern day classic!.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|With new scenes!!!  The movie is now over 3 hours long but worthy of every moment.  One of the first major studio releases that I remember dealing with the Vietnam war.  But, of course, it's about much more than that, isn't it.<br />The horror.  The horror of war, of the psyche, of men's minds warped from senseless violence.  Martin Sheen's character lives it, he knows what it means to be &#34;unsound&#34;, he knows the wild mind of the Brando character.  They can't escape what they've become, they can no longer live a &#34;normal&#34; life.  Maybe it's what we now call PTSD - I guess.  But for these men, there's no wish to escape.  They only seek to immerse themselves in the madness.<br /><br />A timeless film.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Great Music, Great characters. Would recommend for all ages and ethnic groups. Look for to continuing season. Hope cast can recover from the loss of Cory.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is the best season so far - can't wait to watch season 4 and then to get current! Highly recommend Fringe!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|first book was ok. second book...smh...third book...goes on and on and on, now im skipping pages and its still going on and on. Took me about a year to finish because i needed breaks from the awfulness, really only finished this book because my conscience couldn't let a book go unfinished.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow!  This is an incredible puzzle game with great graphics and fun addictive puzzles to solve.  The game takes place in a small area but it is full of fun, intricate puzzles to solve.  Each puzzle leads to the next and then you are suddenly finished with an area and moving to the next.  Don't play this if you don't have lots of time because it is hard to stop once you have started.  There is a help system with hints built into the game to give you nudged in the right direction if you become stuck.  The atmosphere is deliciously created with stunning graphics and wonderful sound effects.  Buy this game if you like puzzles!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Everything was logical but keeps you thinking.  Each level has new challenges.  Could not put it down.  Look forward to more floors.
6303313345|3.0|I bought the movie cause I truly enjoy the story line and Arnold was hot and in at the time the movie was made
B0042JSMV4|5.0|Lots of different types of borders. Glad to see that their were ones that are feminine and other solid that work better for masculine projects. Glad that I have this on Kindle, bookmarks help find ones that I have picked out for the different projects with lots of ease.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Totally not what I was expecting but more then worth watching it twice these kind of movies all ways intrigue me
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you liked Upstairs/Downstairs then you're going to love Downton Abbey. Downton Abbey is a fantastic period series. Nobody does historic drama as the Brits. I am so looking forward to Series 4 which is starting January, 2014.
B009WUBERW|5.0|i thought it was great, it had a lot of action and it was funny at times.  Stallone looked fit and handsome, I was dissappointed with Van Damme, cause I loved him in Blood Sport, but he is old now.  I guess we all get there.  But his body was awesome still.  Overall I would watch it again, I liked it better than the first one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson who is 5 years old asked me to download this for him so I did. It is one of his favorite apps! He plays it all the time and it is great at keeping him occupied when I'm busy. He is 5 years old.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I liked that I could see the way the people at the capital looked.  Really the whole idea of the movie is disturbing but well written.  The movie gives you a visual of the book.  If you have not read the book, you should, the movie cannot portray all that happened in the book, because there was a lot of thoughts that were running thru katniss and this wasn't able to be portrayed.  I will watch the second movie when it comes out.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Originally produced for Iphones, TeamLava was very slow to add functionality for Androids.  Also, they updated the game which slows down progress to a snails pace.  It now takes months to evolve a dragon to top level.  The game has become boring as all functions now take weeks to complete.  It's now feeling like a Tomigochi from the 70s or 80s.  Android users still do not have a trading portal.  I am a level 98 player who used to love this game, but the updates have put a screeching halt to progress and the game just isn't fun anymore.  I haven't completed a goal in 3 months because they are impossible.  I spent months trying to breed a dragon that isn't available on Android, but it still appears on the site as it is available.  I feel like someone new came in and said &#34;let's rip off as many players as we can to make more money&#34;.  They sucked all the fun out of it.  The game is not what it used to be.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Not entirely certainly what I was expecting from this movie but the charm and wonderment was not quite there. While not a bad movie, it was not all that I hoped for. Perhaps a bit too much CGI for my taste. However, I did like the somewhat sympathetic performance of Miss Kunis.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|nice movie but It was really hard to believe in all those things, I will have to see it again. My son loves it and even bought the book, I guess I have to see it again.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This series is amazing writing, staging, acting.  Never should have been cancelled while we were just getting into the characters.
B001OR0AEY|4.0|Rich in cultural elements, story, music and the real human conditions. The  joy and the struggles of simple people that were able to----------a dream. It was a dream that perhaps they did not even know they had. Thanks to the people that were searching  for dreamers, the dream could be reach or lost forever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is an instant classic.  Very well done!  Poignant, funny, sarcastic, sad, joyful - just a beautifully done show!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I find myself actually surprised at how entertained I was when I started playing this game.<br /><br />It downloaded quickly over WiFi and had no problem installing on my Galaxy S 3. The graphicsare simply superb and gameplay was rereally smooth and oddly stress relieving. Loved being able to customize my little boxer! I'm 42 and had a blast with it. Hope it gets lots of downloads for the FAOTD. it's a neat game!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Simply would not install on my Tab 2. The install button was disabled and I paid $4 for nothing at all.
0783230079|4.0|For all who wonder if they have Spirit Guides, this is a must see !  The best rendition of the Spiritual Truth!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I never thought I was any good at puzzles but this game is just right. The graphics are stunningly beautiful and the difficulty increases as you get better. I really enjoy having this game and it is worth paying for.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Good show, a lot of ups and downs to keep it interesting. Some of the other lawyers are rude, and I would love to punch them myself
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I watched all 5 seasons in a very short amount of time,  and I was so disappointed when they were over.  Excellent acting.... I especially liked the family dynamics.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|As a fist-time reader of Lee Child, I was delighted to find another author to follow.  A real page turner.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I did not get a chance to see this in the movies nor read the book but I am so happy I saw the movie now I am reading the book too. Another great job by Stephanie Meyers
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Me and my friend love this game!! The animals are so cute and lovable !  We love our littlest pet shop toys and now we can play it on my kindle!!
B008602KQI|5.0|The story followed the book very nicely and they choose the right characters to play each role in this movie
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I love the Characters in this book.  I love the sense of family. I could do without some of the TMI moments, but otherwise, this is a great book.<br />Reading the book helps one realize just how perfectly cast the movie was. Highly recommend!
1419705644|4.0|This is a great little book written from Abadeer's perspective on the Land of Ooo and its many inhabitants, with margin comments by Marceline, Finn, and Jake. It should be noted however, that there is no &#34;new&#34; information in this book. Perhaps to some who haven't seen all the episodes (or are just starting to get into the show), some sections may certainly help clear things up, but for the most part this is a book made to accompany the existing canon in a more streamlined fashion rather than give insight into unknown aspects of the Land of Ooo.<br /><br />The book's sections are as follows:<br /><br />-- Detailed bio pages on Finn, Jake, PB, Marceline, Ice King, Lady Rainicorn, and LSP.<br />-- A-to-Z mini bios on recurring / minor characters<br />-- A mini glossary on Wizards<br />-- A mini glossary on Princesses<br />-- Ice King's fanfiction (made to look as though drawn and written by Ice King himself)<br />-- An instruction manual for BMO<br />-- PB's Travel Guide to the Candy Kingdom and Beyond<br />-- Marceline's Travel Blog for Demon Backpackers<br />-- Excerpts from The Enchiridion<br />-- Abadeer's Novelty Spells and Cures<br />-- Rather creepy end pages which I will leave you to discover for yourself, but let this be a warning that it may not be appropriate for young children.<br /><br />Now as much as I enjoy the consistent writing style and voice throughout, there are some missing characters whose absences I can't really understand, particularly when Abadeer really has no business knowing a few of the characters that /were/ included in the book. Granted, I understand that not every single character can be included, but I can't really make a case for every character that was included in the book either.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, here are a few notable characters missing from the A-to-Z mini bios:<br /><br />-- Flame Princess (I would just like to point out that she only &#34;appears&#34; twice: First in Finn's bio pages when she's described as his &#34;rebound fixation,&#34; and second in PB's guide to the Fire Kingdom when she's described as the Flame King's &#34;very hip teenage daughter.&#34; That's it. Nothing else about her.)<br />-- Gumball Guardian<br />-- Cosmic Owl<br />-- Pillow People<br />-- Island Lady<br />-- Prismo<br />-- Psychic War Elephant<br />-- Bounce House Princess<br />-- Lady Rainicorn's parents (as a preemptive note to the angry commenter, Jake's and LSP's parents are included.)<br />-- Sleeping Magi<br />-- probably several others.<br /><br />In short, I still very much enjoyed Abadeer's humor in this book and, while I don't really understand how some characters were included over others, I would recommend this as a gift to anyone who enjoys Adventure Time, provided they understand that they won't really receive any &#34;behind the scenes info,&#34; as one reviewer has criticized. Read the book description before you decided whether you would like to purchase the book; it'll save you a world of imagined disappointment.ed as his &#34;rebound fixation,&#34; and second in PB's guide to the Fire Kingdom when she's described as the Flame King's &#34;very hip teenage daughter.&#34; That's it.

0802473156|4.0|Truthfully everything in this book is just common sense, but sometimes you need something like this to help you see what's right in front of your face. It's a short and easy read. It's worth your time to read this, especially if you are having difficulties in your relationship(s) with friends, family and of course a significant other.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Admittedly the two disc thing threw me off, but the music is so worth everything. It's Howard Shore at his finest. The CD arrived two or three days before it was expected to so that always makes everything better, and then it was gorgeous. Perfect use of my money.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|Although they run about a half size larger than expected, they are incredibly comfortable and have bungie adjustments to tighten on the top of the foot.<br />The soles are very thick and remind me of traditional sneaker soles.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I bought this because I loved her song E.T. and then I discovered so many other songs that I loved on this CD.  Totally worth it....and I NEVER buy music!
0062238868|3.0|I was interested at first, but this book tended to be a bit repetitive and over burdensome for me.<br /><br />I applaud the author's commitment to his team, his country and his job.  As a family man, I really struggled to see him always put everything ahead of his family.<br /><br />I've read better and I've read worse stories about this stuff.  If you liked Lone Survivor, or No Easy Day, you'll probably like this then
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I thought it was okay.  I wanted to know how it ended, but I could definitely  put it down.  An okay read.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is the most sound affected game I have  played and it is fun I love the dog and how I can buy cart when I need them and when I want them:)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I had many hours of fun working out this mystery.  The puzzles and the searches were interesting and well planned.  There were a few hidden object names that were mis-translated, but I thought that it just added to the fun.  The hint system was ingenious, and allowed me to get just a tiny bit of direction without spoiling anything.  An excellent effort, development team!  Thank you very much for a great time.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Very well informed and easy to follow for photo enthusiasts and professionals alike. Lightroom 5 is a very good package and this book makes it even better.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Over the last few years, I have become less and less of a Tom Cruise fan.  It seems that he plays the same character in every movie - which distracts from the movie, no matter how good it is.<br /><br />This movie however, was very good.  The story was great, and Tom Cruise played his character well, by stepping outside of himself.  I'll end here - I don't want to give away any spoilers.<br /><br />Thank you!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I rely on Accuweather for any occasion.  When storms move in quickly, I'm always prepared.  Accuweather also gives notice for migraines related to barometric pressure.  I shared it with the neurology department at Tampa General.  Now we all have a 'heads-up'!
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I own several Invicta watches and have never had a problem with any of them. This watch looks a lot more expensive than the bargain price that I paid. Quite impressive.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love this series if u haven't read any of both of the percy Jackson read them I have loved them
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|There's a lot going on here and it doesn't happen in a linear fashion.  Dialogue is fantastic and especially in the future segments where they're using some kind of future-speak that oddly makes perfect sense.  Engaging and smart.  My wife got an infographic before we watched that summarized the different periods over which the movie plays.  I didn't want to see it before we watched the movie, but seeing it would have saved me several rewinds.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Housseini's novel began with a beautiful beginning but soon turned into a labored over-detailed dragged out story.  A good editor would have helped.
B00B2166BS|4.0|The product works as described by the seller.  It indeed charges my tablet faster than the micro USB cable, but it's not as quick as I expected it to be.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great game that works well with the kindle fire. Even better than the PC version. Heroes make the game a lot more interesting.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great action movie and great characters, with a hilarious plot! More than enough shoot em - up, blow 'em - up to satisfy anyone looking for action.  Gratefully, little if any graphic blood and guts!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My husband uses this app way more than I ever will and he has purchased many assorted items from here and has always been satisfied.
0451205766|5.0|Mario Puzo's genius lies not only in his storytelling, but also in his character development. Aside from entry-level hitmen and thugs, virtually every character is given several paragraphs to outline their backgrounds and shed light on their motives and personalities. The rare exceptions are fleshed out through their deeds and interactions with the colourful, eccentric and often very violent cast of characters.<br /><br />From well-endowed Santino, servile second son turned ladies' man Fredo and decorated war hero Michael Corleone, Puzo weaves strands of rich history around each of them. Even Italy's Cosa Nostra and the Corleone mafia operation are richly detailed. In brief, when totalitarian regimes along Mussolini's lines consider the poor and impoverished to be less than the dirt on one's shoes, criminal masterminds move in to replace them, and become the friends and family so desperately desired by the common folk. Don Vito masterfully uses this when expanding his empire and treating his employees (loyal Button Men in prison who keep to the code of silence receive the same wages they would receive if they had not been apprehended).<br /><br />The depictions of brutal murders and love affairs are intricately detailed. Nothing is spared, and some scenes are gruesome, bloody and horrendous enough to produce unpleasant physical symptoms in the reader. Puzo pulls no punches. The anti-negro, anti-non-Sicilian bigotry of the mafia clans and bosses are laid bare (although Vito does transcend his racist upbringing early in the novel).<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to listen to Joe Mantegna's performance from Audible. His deep, lustrous voice echoed through my headphones and allowed me to vicariously live the lives of the Corleones, where death resided on a razor's edge. Broken into three parts, the first began with a wedding, the happiest event in the entire tale. The second detailed Don Vito's rise to power and his masterful reasonableness in striking a peace between all mafia families in New York. The concluding six hours detailed Michael's travails while exiled to Sicily, and his eventual succession to the Don's nigh-impregnable position. Although none of the protagonists are heroes in any real or respectable sense, they are certainly easy to sympathise with, and their actions are at least rational, if not moral or ideal.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This seemed pretty cool since my kids and I enjoy minions so much... however my kids can navigate this game way better than I ever will. They do enjoy it though.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have read all 5 books for game of thrones and i am impressed with the show. Of course there is more detail in the books and i recomend reading them , but the series explains what you need to know! Can't wait for next season. Thanks for the great imagination george!!!
1594487154|1.0|Read the intro and first paragraph of each chapter is enough for me to understand all this book could offer<br /><br />The author bores the reader with redundant/repeated words thorough the book. It explains the same point over and over again. Imagine a college student has to write a 20 page paper on a very small topic that he doesn't have much to say. In order to meet the 20-page requirement, he had to expand on every single details and repeat the thesis a couple times, introduce, analyze and summarize every little story.<br />It will be much better If the book is shortened in half, so that the writer can make his point precise and concise.<br />Plus the book tells us very little about how to SELL, how to influence and connivence<br /><br />In summary, not worth the money, redundant!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|The ideas are easily found in traditional<br /><br /> commentaries.  It is set forward in an easy to read format  but old news to progressive Christians.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book is good for anyone who enjoys flowers. the story is a huge insight into what it is to learn to love. if you are not taught to love then how do you know how to proceed .<br /><br />  this is a very touching story for people that want to understand the different ways to develope a deeper knowledge of how many different ways there are to happiness.<br /><br />  there are some places in the book where the repetition is tiresome. For the most part it is a very well written book with a wonderfully unique approach.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown's books always broaden the way you interpret things real or not.  I liked the intricate plot and the detailed explanations of the symbolism.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I never knew what would happen next. Can't wait to read the others! Great author, really enjoyed her writing style!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Hate that the man playing the doctor left after this season though. Otherwise a good series.  My kids loved it also.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great price for a trilogy to start my nieces collection of the Disney and Pixar movie sets. Should have bought me a set as well!
B00DC3DGSK|1.0|I cannot believe these reviews I am reading.  This CD has the unmistakeable imprint of Tom Hambridge who was producer of the CD and wrote all of the original songs.  And they are awful.  This is not a Buddy Guy CD, it is a Tom Hambridge CD with Buddy Guy playing guitar and singing some God-awful inane lyrics.  Buddy Guy seems to be just going along for the ride on this one.  Buddy Guy is a fantastic blues icon, but seek out Buddy Guy's earlier work if you want some real blues.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I decided to get the blue ray version and I have to say it looks great.  Biggest thing for me is it works and looks good.  5 stars
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son loves the game.  I enjoy playing but the cost of the costumes is annoying.  Apparently Gameloft has never heard of micro-transactions.  How many people really pay $25 for a costume for temple run minion style?  I would pay a dollar, and I would buy multiple costumes to entertain my kid.  They really should just make the costumes cheap and keep adding new ones. They would probably make significantly more money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not just for kids. 1 more time turns into 20+. Have to give it 5 stars. Minion Rush download it
B00CWY76CC|3.0|There were only ten rooms i zoomed through them. Fun though if you want a quick diversion.<br />Puzzles were relatively easy
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is awesome! My kids love playing it, I love playing itAbsolutely love this game, it can be addictive
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very helpful, Nice vivid backgrounds that bring the weather to life in a colorful format. Highly recommended for people on the go. Fast and dependable.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|Good product. Easy to activate all licenses with a software license manager. My DAW software Protools recognize it immediately, no errors, no problems. The iLok's cap get stuck, so I don't close it completely to avoid breaking it accidentally when opening the flash drive. I also would like iLok company to make a smaller flash drive so that the iLok USB end don't be at risk of accidental rupture.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|No one was sitting around waiting for a remake of Love Crime. This comes nowhere close to the directors' dozen or so masterpieces and why he would tackle such mundane material is beyond me. DePalma is a genius but I don't know what has happened to him on these last 3 movies he has made. Also and I hate to say it but Noomi Rapaace was miscast. With all the talent involved this should have been much better. Brian DePalmas' contribution to cinema is  profoundly immense which makes it all the more frustrating when he delivers something substandard.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book was a wonderful end to a series I have been reading since I was 12,( I'm 33 now). Brandon Sanderson has done a wonderful job bringing this unparalleled story to its conclusion. Well done and greatly enjoyed.

B005IZLPME|4.0|My boys and my wife like this movie.  Good special effects.  Decent story.<br /><br />Note on the 3D version of this movie....  thus far this is the only 3D movie I've come across that won't play in my PS3.  I have a Vizio 3D TV.  We have about a dozen other 3D Blu-ray movies and all the other ones work perfectly fine.  This Captain America 3D wont play.  It says I need a compatible 3D player and 3D TV.  I have that.  My kids were not very happy when it wouldn't play.  Thanks for nothin.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Great performances of excellent songs. Weakest spots are Ringo doing his own stuff, but still fun.  Strong performances especially by Lukather & Rollie.
0345529057|3.0|This set of the first four Game of Thrones books would have been an excellent value, except for the fact that the third book was missing about 100 pages, which had been replaced by 100 pages that appeared in their proper order later in the book.  How could the publisher's quality control be that deficient, given the volume of business they are doing?<br /><br />Great story, great value on a $ per word basis, readable format, but marred by poor quality control.  What a shame.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien gets the deluxe treatment here. 4 Alien films and 2 bonus discs stuffed with special features. The cover sticker claims 60 hours of additional content and you won't be disappointed by the quality of the films. Alien gets the special treatment that it deserves. All 4 films get the deluxe treatment. The old content has been ported over from Disc 9 of the insane 9-disc DVD release.<br /><br />Buy this collection. It is considered a must-own because it's one of the best box sets ever released along with the Superman and Matrix franchises.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just found it while cruising thru Amazon Prime on the Roku.  Fun show.....pretty bloody, but decent entertainment.  Go for it.
B0000640SA|4.0|Memento is an incredible movie about a guy who has no short-term memory. The film plays in reverse as Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) tries to remember who he is and how he can avenge his wife's death.<br /><br />The packaging and format of the 2-disc DVD version is unusual to say the least. The movie options on the disc are probably the most complicated I have ever seen. Basically you are shown a screen full of psychological tests before you can play the movie or access the bonus content. It is fun but I still need the guide sitting next to me if I want to do anything except play the main feature. I must admit it does fit the theme of the film quite well and it's definitely original. There is also an easter egg that allows you to watch the film in chronological order. All the extra features on the DVD are ported to the single disc Blu-ray except \\"Mindbenders and Challenges Designed by Nolan to Unlock Hidden Disc Features\\" that has some easter eggs such as the chronological view.<br /><br />Special Feature:<br />* \\"Remembering Memento\\" - a 10-year anniversary look back on the making of the film<br />* IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan<br />* Audio Commentary with Director Christopher Nolan<br />* \\"Anatomy of a Scene\\" Sundance Channel Documentary<br />* \\"Memento Mori\\" - Short Story by Jonathan Nolan<br />* Feature Script, * Tattoo Gallery, * Leonard's Journal<br /><br />Buy Memento. I would rate the film 5 stars and the packaging and content 4 stars. It is a very original and well-acted film. Check the version before you buy to get the copy you want.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This turned out to be such a fun read. Characters you grow to love, and hate. Poor twists that made me gasp it loud. Started too was at too late several nights just to see what would happen. Will recommend to ask my friends as a great summer escape. Thank you Scott Lynch for the Gentleman Bastards, Elderglass, and the really nasty evil villains.
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|Some Dark Knight fans may complain not enough new content is added here (roughly 90 minutes of exclusive content). However, it does seem to have all of the previously released content from the box set and individual releases. The films haven't been restored or extended from the old transfers. This collection isn't brimming with special features even with 6 discs. It does offer toys, cards, a book and some new featurettes but it seems bloated with packaging. The special features aren't evenly balanced either (The Dark Knight gets light treatment). There is over 6 hours of bonuses here but compare that to the 18 hours in the Batman Anthology BR release of the first four Batman films. It lacks a truly comprehensive, feature-length documentary about the franchise that should be 2-4 hours long. The single longest featurette here runs about an hour. Some mini-documentaries; few deleted scenes and no director's commentaries (Nolan did only one for Memento). There is much recycled content from Batman Begins (2-Disc Edition), Dark Knight (2-Disc Edition) & Dark Knight Rises (3-Disc Edition). Disc 1: Batman Begins Feature + Special Features. Disc 2: The Dark Knight Feature. Disc 3: The Dark Knight Special Features. Disc 4: The Dark Knight Rises Feature. Disc 5: The Dark Knight Rises Special Features.

Hardcore fans may be expecting more after previous releases held back. There is about 90 minutes of fresh content here (Fire Rises & A Conversation) and the old content won't blow your mind. An ultimate collector's edition should have at least 3-4 hours of new material and good-to-great remastering, deleted scenes and director's commentaries. The Dark Knight Rises looks great but Batman Begins and Dark Knight could use a polish. We get mostly short documentaries and featurettes so this is the \\"light edition\\" box set. It does make the Dark Knight Trilogy previously released on BR obsolete. Warner Bros. did an amazing job with Blade Runner so why not Dark Knight?

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Started reading without high hopes. The book took awhile to build up, but as it got going, it consumes you until you finish the entire book. So many plot twists that blow your mind away. Awesome fantasy adventure. Can't wait to read the next books in the series!
B004LROUW2|2.0|I suppose if you are a Murakami fan all these little idiosyncratic things would be charming.  But this was the first book I'd read by Murakami.  I didn't like it.  I read 300 pages and I had not got &#34;into&#34; it; I was tired of endless descriptions of minutiae and really didn't care any more.  I originally liked the premise that making a small change in life - something different - might put you into an alternate universe but that seemed the least of the themes pursued.  So, as I said, after 300 pages I gave it up.  I have stacks of other books waiting to be read and time is short.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun. Even the children enjoy it. They keep following me around the house because they want a chance to play.
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who's Next CD is chockful of great songs.  I listen to it as often as I can as one can never tire of such classics.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wow! This game is fun but frustrating. I agree with other reviewers; game needs hint option. Wld like more levels please!
B00AGE2HPG|4.0|The movie advertised is not the one I viewed, but the version I was looking for.  Debra Winger as an FBI agent looking for the woman who marries very rich men and then kills them.  Sometimes the plot was confusing as to why she was so desperate to find this woman and what triggered her search.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|....nearly perfect album from the best artist out there! This body of work is an extension of Born & Raised, although it may be a little more country and a bit more electric. I love this album! I Will Be Found and Waitin' On The Day are my favorites. Thanks John!
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|Luckily this was a freebie otherwise I would have wasted money.  I removed this app from my Kindle. I do not recommend it.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|It's a drama, not an action movie. Many people today cannot sit through a movie unless there is massive car chases, explosions and do not really need a plot. This movie tells the story behind the efforts to hunt down OBL. I enjoyed it. It's not Shakespeare, but a good solid movie.
B000WCBMA8|4.0|Clearly everything is wrong about my really digging this album as I am old and too uncool, but once I made it through the first listen, then another, and then a third, I realized just how good of a rock 'n roll record \\"The Black and White Album\\" is.<br /><br />The Hives carry off that calculated cool arrogance backed up by plenty of chops to crank out the sort of music we all need to hear live and short of that can use as fuel on a morning drive to work when the coffee is failing to jump start the day.<br /><br />The sound is punchy, clean, and clear. This is a great recording for showing off your gear, demoing speakers, or menacing timid friends. Swedish rock, huh? Well, done lads.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|While John Mayer is still to repeat the effortlessly fresh formula of his 2006 masterpiece \\"Continuum\\", \\"Paradise Valley\\" finds him in a pleasantly sparse, folksy mood, with his songcraft and knack for melodies remaining intact.<br /><br />A year on the heels of \\"Born And Raised\\" (2012), when John was musically and lyrically reeling from a media controversy, he still needs a \\"paradise valley\\" as a certain form of escapism. Specifically, he tries to take listener to a place of inner peace, inhabited by things which are good to think of, such as a nostalgic memory of first love (\\"Dear Marie\\"). This is a place of wide American prairies, full of musical inspiration.<br /><br />That said, \\"Paradise Valley\\" has its share of surprises. Beautifully melodic, \\"You're No One 'Til Someone Lets You Down\\" is as bluegrass as John ever got, although a depressing lyric does not lie - he sounds like he really knows better. And \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" makes an impression as if taken directly from an Eric Clapton early 1970's album - without being a copycat.<br /><br />A solid album from John Mayer - as an excellent songwriter, guitar player and singer - is sure to find its listeners maybe even outside his regular fanbase, even though he is more country and folk these days than ever before. The cover art tells the truth.
0811875040|5.0|This book could sit on your coffee table.<br />The photographs are equisite , and the recipes are some of the best I have ever seen.<br />The book also cover many baking categories and up to the minute new tastes.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Good action and intrigue. Season two continues with many rich and morally ambiguous characters. Just as soon as you are ready to loath a character they reveal a redeeming trait or explanatory event.<br /><br />Season two features more graphic and gratuitous sex depicted the way a teenage boy would fantasize it. The scenes of male initiation and domination seem plausible. The female initiated scenes and participation seem obviously written by men…don’t wring true. The authors should have either introduced a woman into their team or at least read Masters and Johnson and the Hite Report.<br /><br />Season one did not require much belief in the supernatural – dragons, magic and mystical powers. Season two makes that element pivotal. I didn’t see that as an improvement.<br /><br />Delivery via Amazon streaming video was mixed. One episode in non HD was so bad that I purchased the next episode in HD…possible more frustrating. I would recommend downloading and watching non-streaming.<br /><br />All that said I will proceed to season three.
1401907725|5.0|I got my deck when they came out in 2006 and used them almost everyday.  As my son got older he was amazed watching me do readings(only for our family situations) and how accurately they came out.  He started using them to deal with the issues he was having in his life. Sometimes getting the same card multiple times in a row as he was ignoring the information. That really blew his mind. (He's only 18)  Unfortunately they were stolen out of his car recently and I had to replace them which is why the rebuy.  He said &#34;we'll at least whoever stole them will know they robbed a child of God&#34;. A lot of other things were stolen too!  Love these cards! Amazing
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|I waited over two weeks for this adapter to arrive and was disappointed to find that was a counterfeit.  Though the Amazon listing has pictures of a genuine apple adapter with the correct part numbers, the product I received is a cheaply made knockoff.  The packaging has no company name or part number on it and the adapter itself doesn't have the grey port symbols.<br /><br />Do not buy.
B000KE1PDC|5.0|This is a superb rendition of Dickenson's classic novel. Maggie Smith never fails to deliver a magnificent performance. Well worth every penny.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|I got this Blu-Ray from Amazon and have been satisfied very much because of good quality of picture and sound with my home theater system and 55 inch LED screen, plus this includes two versions of dubbing in Japanese and Japanese subtitle. This comes with collector's items each of these looks fantastic. I also have a DVD, but this Blu-Ray was far beyond my expectation.
B009S33I68|5.0|As a Vietnam Veteran also serving in the Pleiku area as an Infantry Squad Leader I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend to all who want to learn more of the horrible fire fight. From what I have read elsewhere, the book told the real story of those four days. More than 300 American soldiers killed and many, many more wounded during that fight.
B00EFNXPFK|2.0|This album sounds like a folk record by a singer running out of gas, or perhaps Mayer's attempt to channel the Mumford and Sons vibe? I didn't mind Born and Raised as a diversion from his sound, but this one is even less energetic. It lacks the memorable guitar chops and strong vocals that Mayer is famous for. Just when you start to give him credit for going off in his own direction creatively, he shamelessly taps pop stars Katy Perry and Frank Ocean for two songs. Maybe its just me, but the record sounds just like the album cover looks. Strange and wandering.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Came into the game today to find the large chests I made were not showing up. They are still there as indicated by shadows, but the chests themselves are missing. Is this a glitch across the game or something wrong with just my version? Thanks!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|An older movie that has been revised in the Blue-Ray format.  Great history film, great actors and a super story.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Can't wait to watch season 5, just downloaded it.  I lost track of the show after season 3, SO GLAD I found it again...
B0043KK4N6|4.0|Take the music with you in the car!  Neat music to listen to while driving when you can not watch the movie.
0307272702|5.0|There are so many excellent comprehensive reviews of this excellent book that I will not presume to write another one. I would just like to say that Taubes does not only discuss theories, hypotheses, and diets - in fact, this is not a diet book and does not contain a single recipe - he gives examples of the effects of diet on real people, some of which are so memorable that they stick with you long after you have finished this book. For example, he depicts a scene in a Sâo Paolo clinic where a grossly overweight woman is holding her emaciated child. If eating too much were the cause of obesity, then one would have to conclude that this mother was gorging herself while starving her child. Taubes states that such behavior would go against everything we know about motherhood and argues that it should be obvious that both mother and child are suffering from the effects of malnutrition. (I have lived in Brazil and found parents there fiercely protective of their children - a Brazilian mother would much more likely starve herself to feed her child than the other way around.)<br /><br />As for his identification of carbohydrates and sugar as the culprits causing the widespread obesity epidemic, he certainly makes a plausible case, but I am not obese. I have in fact maintained the same weight for many years. I eat bread (whole wheat) with a bit of marmalade for breakfast, pasta (mostly whole wheat), fruit juices and fresh fruit (all foods Taubes indicts for many of our problems), but mostly lots of green vegetables, yams and sweet potatoes, lots of fish, some poultry, a bit of meat and both red and white wine - a largely Mediterranean diet. I eat no fried foods, never eat in fast food emporia, never eat processed foods, never eat anything that contains hydrogenated oils or high-fructose corn syrup, and maintain a low sodium diet (but not very low - most days just under 2,000 mg). I think that's a pretty healthy diet though I do have some issues typical of men my age. I would hesitate to do anything as radical as eliminating carbohydrates and sugar altogether, though if I had a weight problem, and everything else I tried had failed, I probably would give it a try.<br /><br />I learned quite a bit from this book, even if I may not follow all its recommendations (I may limit my carbohydrate intake a bit more). In fact, one of the things I like about this book is that the author is not doctrinaire or judgmental, does not deliver sermons or threaten disobedient readers with hellfire, indeed objects to the nutritional establishment's implicit suggestion, with its insistence that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little, that any overweight person must be guilty of gluttony and/or sloth. Read this book, and don't worry; Taubes won't excommunicate you from the human race if you don't agree with everything he writes. Highly recommended.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|I loved the figure, it looks great. The only cons is the lack of accessories when you compare with other figures of the same collection. However it will look great at the side of a Dragon Ball figure I have since '95.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's funny because this book is phenomenal all on its own, without inserting spelling bee worthy words or using metaphors/similes every other line. The language and theme of Silver Linings Playbook is very simple; yet, at the same time really touching and beautifully told. The narrator, Patrick or better known as Pat, is such a refreshing character. He is very optimistic, and although this optimism is sometimes borderline naive for me-I still applaud how hopeful he is, and I wish I could have such a positive outlook on life. This book is a very funny, uplifting, and an enjoyable read. It's all about choosing to be positive, and having hope that everything will get better even if in that moment everything seems to be going downhill.<br /><br />There was a lot of talk about football, especially the eagles, so if you are a fan of football this book will definitely entertain. I am not really a fan-I watch it sometimes but I am not obsessed with it-so the football talk didn't really appeal to me.<br /><br />The movie was excellent as well, so those of you who want to watch it after reading the story, I definitely suggest it!<br /><br />This is just one of those books that stays with me, and gives insight on mental instability; yet, I feel as if (after reading this book) mentally ill people can teach us &#34;mentally stable&#34; people a thing or two. I loved Silver Linings Playbook from the first page, till the very end
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Until now the device delivers completely wrong figures.<br />Doing sports it does monitor as sleeping etc.<br /><br />NOT USABLE AT ALL

B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This show has so many positives, the only negative is if you watch it on television and deal with the commercials and cuts, as an American I say Boo to Fox for even thinking they can remake this into an American version.
B004GFN11A|1.0|I downloaded this app then quickly deleted it. I have a WordPress blog which isn't self hosted and I couldn't use this app to access it.  The only options were for new blogs to sign up and self hosted ones. Not the best

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|As an elementary school student in the early 40's and college in the 50's, this period of history was never covered.  A fascinating read.  Little has changed in our government.
193700788X|3.0|How do I start? I totally fell in love with Sookie many years ago and slowly fell out of love with her as well these past few. I am one that will read a whole series no matter how far downhill it goes til it gets to the end so i can get that closure.  i feel sort of empty. Obviously Sookie and Sam were meant to be together. But did it really need to take 14 years for it to happen?! I am not shocked at the ending or surprised or happy. The way this series ended was just &#34;meh&#34;. It was better than the last few books in the series though. I really don't have too much to say other than I'm sort of in the middle in being glad that it is over, but it could probably use maybe a novella to completely finish it off.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|Has all DCs Justice League and many Super Villians + action + humor (for both the kids and their parents).  Keep it up Lego and DC/Warner Bros.
B000MV90IU|5.0|it's just as enjoyable as ever and the chase scene is still one of cinema's best. My heart still races when I see an old Mustang or Charger.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I always enjoy books that keep you wanting to read until you finish them.  You never know what the next part of the plot is going to be.  It keeps you guessing so you can't put the book down.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Loved app on 1st use.  However, at that time, I experienced poor performance, e.g., finding my phone from my computer; and often it took multiple tries to get all my pictures downloaded to my computer.<br /><br />Communicated my experiences to the developer, and before long the problems went away.  Since then, I RELY on this app whenever I want to transfer pics between my smartphone, my tablet, and my computer; and always without error -- whether I'm transferring 1 picture or 30 (I think that's the most I've done at one time).
B009CAAQIA|2.0|As inessential and distracting as a third testicle or a shirt that says &#34;Say Relax Frankie,&#34; this cash-grab compilation serves only to frustrate and befuddle.  It made me whip out &#34;Welcome To The Pleasuredome&#34; one more time to get the bad zeros and ones out of my ears.  Frankie say no more, please.
0802473156|5.0|My cousin recommended this book.  It's a fascinating theory that there are five ways to express love emotionally: words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time and physical touch.  Gary Chapman, a marriage counselor, believes that we each have a primary language and if we want to meet the needs of our spouse, and have our needs met, it is invaluable to understand what is each other's primary language.<br /><br />The book is clear and readable.  I wonder if our primary emotional language is related to our Myers-Briggs type.  For example, I suspect that sensors on the Myers-Briggs might tend to favor acts of service over words of affirmation, for example.  It seems like this book has helped, and will continue to help, lots of folks understand what is important to them in a relationship.
0226264211|5.0|Highly recommended for any dindividual. Very in-depth, plenty of evidence, though sometimes it can be lacking a little bit. Not exactly a huge issue, however.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish there were more levels! They should allow the game to go pass level 10! otherwise this a good mind thinking game! I would recommend my friends and family to play.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I played for free and decided I liked it enough to buy it.  The time to purchase is when you are in the girl's bedroom.  I was supposed to find the hidden objects including 4 crayons.  I had to use the hint button to find the 4th crayon. It is located behind the back button so I can't get it.  What a ripoff. I was enjoying the game until then. Since I can't finish the puzzle I can't finish the game.
1442359315|5.0|This is a very well told story of the author's near death experience.  As a neurosurgeon, the author is able to give additional insights and although some of it may be a bit technical, its not dry or boring.  Since this is an audio recorded version, I'll note that it was easy to listen to, clear and easy to listen to.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|loved the series... loved the books more but I wanted to collect al lthe DVD for this movie series to my collection of DVDs...
1401907725|3.0|Cards have great illustrations and are aesthetically pleasing.  However, when newly taken out of package, the edges of cards are all stuck together and not easy to pull apart.  Several of them are starting out with a small dog ear bc when using my fingernail to attempt to separate, it caught within the card vs between the cards - no way to tell this as you're separating them.<br /><br />These cards are nice in that along with the trait/vision on the card, there is a paragraph or so of explanation.  Unfortunately, it can be difficult to read because of the font used and glare of the finish.<br /><br />Whether you believe in divination or not, they are useful in providing a focus for the day and something to ponder.  I gave this  deck to someone with early stage Alzheimer's Disease to give them some inspiration for the day, provide us with something to talk about and hopefully take their mind off their anxiety or help with it through the inspirations.

B009NY43NY|2.0|Disapointed about how things were left.<br />So many things could have been revisited in a better way.<br /><br />As much as this series was steamy....there was nothing steamy about this book. A little bit at the end and that's it.<br /><br />Waste of money for this last book!

B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Very odd book. Found it boring at times and exciting at others. I would recommend other books over this one. Like The Book of Lost Things or Ready Player One or Enders Game.
B004TI5N38|5.0|John Puller, he prefers to be called Puller is a Chief Warrant Officer-investigator in the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation division and a solid investigator.  Puller's dad is a 3 star General in a hospital with the beginnings of dementia and his older brother is in a Federal prison for treason (we don't know why - he has a top degree in nuclear whatever).  The plots that Baldacci dreams up are always great and keep you on edge throughout and &#34;oh yes&#34; the endings are always surprising. I'm a Baldacci fan and try to read all of his books; haven't found one that has been disappointing.  Cliff Mitts

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Well written.  I like the inward, thinking aspect of the wife and her way of being true to herself.  Been a while since i finished this so details are no longer fresh in my mind.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Not much of a film, but decent performances.  A 'not coming of age' film rather than a 'coming of age' film.  Sadly, there are too many people like this.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good reading and I am enjoying the complex story! I am having a hard time putting it down but I have to sleep.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Director J.J. Abrams' imaginative 2009 revival of the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise - handled with style, vitality and good humor. Engaging performances from the rebooted Enterprise crew, but Leonard Nimoy's welcome appearance is nothing short of sublime. Solid scripting by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Far superior to the heavy-handed \\"Star Wars\\" prequels.
034580404X|5.0|The books were a great read. People gave it a lot of flack for the way it is written, but as individuals you have to be open minded, the only states what a lot of us humans do behind closed doors , and if not behind closed doors our wondering minds does. We all humans..
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable, intriguing and wonderfully intricate. Larsson truly is worthy of the reputation he has gained through the trilogy, highly recommended read.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This is a hilarious vampire romance.  It has romance,  suspense and the vampire that saves the lady.  Get ready to laugh!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|&#34;I'm gonna expose the whole thing.&#34;<br /><br />Do you know that line? It's in the movie. You'd know it if you had already bought this movie and were watching it right now. But, you're not. You're reading this. I pity you. Well, I would if I weren't busy watching my own copy of this movie....that I own...right now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie everyone I talked to said you've got to read the book.  So I read the book and was so glad I did! It is a fast paced read with details that makes you feel like you are right there with Katniss. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the trilogy.
B000000ISB|5.0|First a little honesty. I was a big Rush fan beginning with their first album, and bought each album up to and including Hemispheres, and even had All The World's A Stage. For reasons that I no longer remember, I jumped off the Rush bandwagon. That's right, after all that time, I bailed at about the time the band was at the top of their game and creating artful music.<br /><br />So I find this gold disc used, and cheap. I didn't steal it but it was a steal. It was missing the back tray liner and had no case - just the CD and the booklet. But that's easy to remedy. So I snatched it up and gave it a listen.<br /><br />Even though my Rush obsession ended before this album was released, I had certainly heard Tom Sawyer and Limelight over and over again on the radio, and they are still being played on classic rock radio today. What took me by surprise were the other songs. Rush certainly were in top form. The intricate rhythms, time changes, and Alex Lifeson's always incredibly amazing guitar playing are just stunning. The synths are used to great effect and don't overwhelm. I am sorry I didn't keep up with Rush.<br /><br />The sound of the gold disc is astoundingly bright and clear. I can pick out every instrument and note. This makes the CD player in my truck sound like a high end home system!<br /><br />There are a handful of must-own Rush albums and this is one of them.
B002NF1ZI6|4.0|I purchased these for my nephew, and he loves them,so many hours of fun.  He only wished there were more in the box?!!!
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|After two intricate prog-rock classics - Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here - Floyd strip down their sound. Acoustic guitar is present in all the songs, but Gilmour's electric guitar drives simple guitar/bass/drums/keys arrangements. But this is Pink Floyd, so sound effects have to used, and this time it's barking dogs, bleating sheep and oinking pigs. Each song is simply titled Dogs, Sheep, Pigs. The animals represent certain kinds of humans within society and how they interact socially and economically. The lyrical themes are just as bleak as the cover photo. Yet during the song Sheep, the sheep rise up and turn on their oppressors, while reciting a warped rewrite of Psalm 23. A happy ending, I suppose. Animals is yet another masterpiece from the band and belongs alongside the other aforementioned classics.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|Good start, but needs redone. It's like a rough draft. The widgets don't make a whole lot of sense either. That being said, this app is better than most anything out there that is comparable.
0770435726|4.0|How wonderful to find a well written mystery that does not follow a narrative formula. The plot kept me guessing and the conclusion a surprise.  I especially liked the back and forth from previous life to current, from spy to mother as well as all the cyber intrigue. IF there is a flaw it has to due with two incidents the main character disregarded at the time (won't tell you) but jumped off the page. Her lack of wariness seemed out of character. Was this intentional? Had the author momentarily forgotten and covered his tracks by stating her realization in the final chapter? OR was this to show a flaw in her almost perfect analyses?
B00957T6X6|5.0|Really enjoyed the books! Could not put them down, well written.  I just hope there are follow-up books coming.<br />Of course their is more detail than the series on TV.  Have enjoy the series but loved the books more.
0307719219|1.0|What a topic and in spite of the hefty tome not well presented. Much is made of inclusive and economic exclusive systems  Inclusiveness was not well-defined, and the examples were few.  At times I  found much of the analysis arbitrary–the critical junctures— and  contradictory. I sometimes had to pause in my reading to question why a certain word was used...because it did not  fit the context.  The most infuriating part, was the repeated introduction of an idea and the promise to discuss it in the next chapter. What a waste of time and effort. Theirs and mine
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun and challenging with a wide variety of difficulty.  The music is very pretty and relaxing.  Overall, great game, Hours of playtime
B00APYKXFS|1.0|I could not figure out how to play the game.  Action games are not my first choice.  I guess I was predisposed not to like it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really enjoy using this application. It is surprising how many times I need to get a quick calculation during the week, and this application makes it easy.

B005UG542S|5.0|I am a huge fan of Harry potter I loved the movie although after reading the books I must say that I didn't like how it differed from the book. It happened too much. Still loved both the movie and book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really think and that a lot of people agree with me it needs to have multiplayer that you can play not just with people of the same sever but around America if it had that it would totally be 5 stars.
0393338398|5.0|I'm not one for detailed, wordy reviews, but I'll say this:  This book should be common reading.  I mean that for the general populace.  While Moneyball is about analytics in baseball, the moral of the subject is such that it could be applied to many sectors of the economy and society in general.  Moneyball touches on the negative consequences of biased, prejudiced thinking in the baseball industry, and how inefficient practices took root, eliminating objective and critical thinking in the process.  So you see, instead of writing about specific baseball features of the book, I decided that the moral theme of the book should be promoted for the benefit of everyone.  I suppose the moral of this story is never assume anything in this world has absolutes that you must fully abide by.  There are always imperfections.  FIVE STARS!!!
B009WUBERW|3.0|One of the good movie to pass the time. I loved Arnold than any other character. He is still charming with good physique even at this age
B0039TAHMA|2.0|Love the movie, do not like the service. Movie just quit and won't start again, bell rang and there was a blank screen so I started over but it will not play, just says screen loading...... if this is what happens in a free sample of the product, I will not be willing to pay for any other movie.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This was quite an interesting addition to the Pendergast saga, in that over the last several novels, the authors have been deconstructing Pendergast as the omnipotent force for good, and, frankly, have made him a modern day Job, being dealt all manner of foulness and treachery to bring him down from his pedestal. In this novel, while the character was dealt some of the harshest blows one could ever imagine, he actually came through a better and stronger character as a result. I appreciate that, and hope it is done. This is the last of the Helen trilogy, which has been a true slog for me to read, mainly because of the said deconstruction of Pendergast, and I say good riddance if we can get back to the Pendergast of Relic, Still Life With Crows and Cabinet of Curiosities fame. I hate to read the constant knocking down of a hero. Fighting and standing, fine. Being ground into the dirt, no thanks. Call me an escapist, but when I read for fun, I expect as much. Depth, interest, and intelligence can all be fun, so lets have it! Those are the things that bring Pendergast alive, not making him merely human. On the positive side, I did like the side story of Constance and the revelations which hearken back to past storylines. Spectacular tie ins to the past novels! I look forward to the next in the series, in that we are past the past. Time for a totally new and interesting tack. Full sails ahead...
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Have you seen \\"The American\\" with George Clooney? Confused by butterflies and rifles? It's a beautifully filmed movie...majestic mountains, snow scenes, hilltop villages. Set in Sweden in the early scenes but shifting to a medieval village in the hill country of Northern Italy for the remainder of the film. Although the critics say the only thing American about the film is the title and Mr. Clooney, they are rating the movie three out of five stars probably for the cinematography.<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of the 1990 book by British writer Martin Booth (1944-2004)) entitled A VERY PRIVATE GENTLEMAN: the book explains all. Booth's tale is a character study about a loner who is no \\"gentleman\\": it is also a tragedy following events in the life of a gunsmith who sells his services to assassins. The style is partly in the form of classic confessional writing, as the protagonist seeks to explain the relevance of his choice of profession. The time of the story seems to be late 20th century, more or less similar to the year of publication. The story is written in the first-person narrative from the point of view of the main character, who is known as Edmund or Signor Farfalla.<br /><br />There are only three major characters in both media (perfectly cast in the film especially George Clooney as Farfalla):<br /><br />....Signor Farfalla \\"Mr. Butterfly\\" is a middle-aged man from a country where English is spoken as a first language. He is loner who paints miniatures of butterflies and has traveled to the area to capture a unque native specimen. He is also a \\"shadow-dweller,\\" a technical weapons expert who creates and supplies tools for high-level assassins. He is a lecturer of sorts in the novel, who is not apologetic about his profession: he sees the need for people who kill to change the world for the better. In the film, Farfalla is consumed by a feeling of doom over the use of his weapons...and vows that he will retire after finishing the current product.<br /><br />...Father Bendetto is the local Catholic priest in the Italian village. He befriends Farfalla, and they discover a common interest in wine, food, and discussion and debate.<br /><br />...Clara is a young Italian student. She meets Farfalla when he becomes her regular customer in the local bordello.<br /><br />THE AMERICAN is a movie that will view better after reading the book! Even reading the reviews of the book will enlightened you. The main differences between the novel and the film are the aesthetic tone and the ending. Both endings are satisfactory...but only after reading the novel and viewing the film adaption...can one choose a favorite...<br /><br />Postscript: The professional reviews of this novel are displayed on the original product page for [[ASIN:0312309090 A Very Private Gentleman: A Novel]]. (Booklist gives Booth's tale a starred review and calls it thought-provoking literary fiction.) I purchased the Media Tie-In [[ASIN:B004P5OPPM The American]]: The movie was a special treat the day after my 77th birthday in 2010!><br />...Father Bendetto is the local Catholic priest in the Italian village.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I liked the good writing - This is a thoughtful, well written book. It is at the same time funny and serious. I enjoyed reading it and learned from it. You gave me much to think about. Thank you.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was a page turner from the beginning.  I rated a 3 star because I was disappointed with the ending.  Given that the start was so great I didn't expect the twisted turn it ended with.  If I had read all the others reviews prior to purchasing the book I might not have bought it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele and looked forward to receiving the CD. The CD came packaged perfect with no damage. The songs were awesome too.
1250012570|5.0|The only unbelievable thing about this book is the lack of people enamoured with both Park and Eleanor. Both perfectly flawed and wonderfully themselves.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really liked the story after I got the hang of the switching back and forth of 3 separate families.

B007JZW3VS|5.0|A real page-turner. Wouldn't let go of the book to the last page. I'll be looking for other books by McCullers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This games is great it is like owning a real horse!  So good but in the beggining they should give you more Jems.
B0096HLN9K|3.0|I like Scream 3 better than 2 and 4. It's more fun, it's more campy and the peripheral actors are much less annoying. The storyline is way better than 2.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Highly recommended! well who does not love Sherlock Holmes movie especially with Robert Downey Jr! This is a great movie for anyone who has a mind to think and problem solve. highly recommend this movie for all ages!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've rewatched these episodes. This is the kick off for years of great Who. If you don't love Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, you're not a real fan. He does such a great job, adding depth to the character, making him likable and vulnerable. And Rose. So fun and smart and such a great match for him.
B0002FR0TC|1.0|The video doesn't play on any dvd player. I feel scammed. I tried playing this video of the DVD in Blu ray it didn't work. I tried playing it in a portable DVD player it didn't play. I tried playing it in the old DVD player it didn't play. This is the worst experience I've ever had and I am ashamed to have purchased this from this person! I want my money back!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is probably the most used app on my Kindle Fire. Since I'm planning my wedding, it is very helpful. You can find.  ANYTHING on Pinterest. I highly recommend this app!
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Best purchase ever! Recommended! if you're into vampire movies this is the movie to see of course vampires and werewolves highly recommend this movie! Action packed scary creepy adrenaline junkie type movie!

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I haven't left a review here before but I felt compelled to after my experiences with the Chromecast. I'm reasonably tech-savvy and normally don't have too much trouble with networking but this thing has left me stumped. I can \\"see\\" the Chromecast but I'm unable to connect to it with any of my devices. I wouldn't complain about something like this usually; I'm well aware of the gaps in my knowledge and would just shrug my shoulders and get over it, or at least have patience until there was more troubleshooting info available on the forums. Having said that, the device was billed as really simple to set up, and it seems that Google's tech support expects that it will be a pretty foolproof process; if you've gone through the troubleshooter, their advice is to \\"try/get a new router.\\" There's not really any support.<br /><br />I'm not out too much cash as I received the Netflix promo, and I figure one of these days I'll get some use out of it once it gets a larger install base and Google compiles a more detailed support guide. It just really sucks that I got more help from the Chromecast subreddit than I did Google. I'd be wary about paying full price for it right now.
B00AZR1N6I|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Heartlake High Play Set comes with a big 487 pieces. It includes a girl character (Stephanie), a boy character (Matthew), and a teacher character (Ms. Stevens). It has four rooms including a lobby/enterance area with a snack bar and lockers, two classrooms and a bathroom. It is a modular style set where you can move the rooms around. You can stack them to make a three story building, you can stack two and make it two stories or just all rooms next to each other on one level. The classrooms are set up as an art class and a science class. The art class has paint supplies, an easel, and music equipment. The science class has a telescope, microscope, chemistry equipment and a blackboard. There are also a lot of other classroom accessories and outdoor items like a bike, picnic bench and a basketball hoop. It is a really nice and big set with a lot of playability and plenty of pieces to let your child's imagination run wild. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the recommended age is 6-12, but a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution, the MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $49.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target/LEGO and usually when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out. Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a big and fun set that will be a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. The modular design allows your child to set up the school however they want and the unique school pieces are great to have.  While this is one of the more expensive LEGO Friends sets, the 10 cent per piece price is right in-line with the average for other multi-character sets.  Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Please Note: There is a another Amazon listing that usually has a better price when Amazon is the seller here: [[ASIN:B00CWER3Z2 LEGO Friends Heartlake High]]ever they want and the unique school pieces are great to have.

B009RH9HDS|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift for a Grandson's 12th birthday.  He had some influence on the color of course.  The fit is very good and the 180 degree functionality is a nice add to a standard cover.  He had a cover but immediately replaced it with his new cover.  It appears to be well made and we expect it to give him good service for some time to come.
B006ZS4H9Q|5.0|Our 5 year old daughter loves Lego Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased a set for Christmas and it was a big hit. We got this little set for her to expand her collection and she loves it.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Andrea's Bunny House Set comes with 62 pieces. It includes the Andrea character and her pet bunny. It also includes the bunny house and garden items as well as some bunny food and accessories. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a 5 year old. The recommended age is 5-12 and a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution. I have found that the average per piece price of the LEGO Friends sets are around 10-12 cents per piece for the smaller sets. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target or when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more. This particular set is on the smaller end of the $10 sets so it is a little more expensive on a per piece basis. Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection if you can find it for around $10. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />UPDATE: Since this original posting of this review, this set has been RETIRED by LEGO. Now that the set has been retired, it will not be as readily available and will most likely become more expensive from various sellers. If you want this set, make sure to shop around and be aware that you may be paying a premium for this RETIRED set.

B005544V6A|5.0|This show is highly energetic. The story lines have actually taught me<br />about certain angles of the law. The cast is extremely talented and<br />their chemistry makes it a &#34;win-win&#34; show.
0985557834|5.0|Just like vol 1 this is an absolute must read for anyone interested in para cord tying!<br /><br />It is very easy to understand unlike many other books out there.<br /><br />This book is very well done!
B00DU74U74|3.0|It was kind of boring and not as action filled with a plausible plot as I had hoped. The Trailer showed more impact than the actual movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was skeptical that a book about children playing at war could hold my attention. The story has some dated geopolitical elements but the character of Ender draws you into the world of games.  If you liked Lord of the Flies and the Hunger Games (but for the story not the romance) then this book might interest you. There are enough sci-fi elements to keep it in the category and move the plot forwards, without too much boring (to me) technical mumbo jumbo for its own sake.  I look forward to the next book in the series.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I had high hopes for this device since I assumed that this company is aware of fitbit and other devices and how competitive wearable technology is getting. However, I didn't exactly find what I was looking for...<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Lightweight<br />-Extremely easy to set up<br />-Accurate step counts<br />-Sleep tracking is a big plus and seems accurate<br />-Really motivates you to go out and reach 10,000 steps.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sleep tracking is funky. I put the device in my pocket when I woke up today. Never checked it all day long and when I checked it at the end of the day it was tracking my sleep. It missed a full day... I am not sure if this is a problem specific to my device.<br /><br />-Heart rate measurements are way off. Example: measurement 1 = 56 bpm. After 4 or 5 seconds I measured my heart rate again and it was 140ish. I was sitting on my bed during these measurements. Don't buy this product if you plan to measure your heart rate. I just use it for fun...<br /><br />-Can't set goals (Seriously Withings?). It has its own goals (10000 steps and 8 hours of sleep a day). This should be easily fixable with a firmware update.<br /><br />Overall, this product has some good features but doesn't offer more than (not counting crappy heart rate sensor) what other devices currently offer.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Easily the most beautiful, imaginative, artistically superb animated film I have ever seen.  Not to be missed, young or old.  I had to own it so I could watch it over and over, share with grandchildren and I have sent it as a gift as it was a gift to me.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|As always, Mr Follett captures your imagination in the lives of his characters. A wonderful story and history lesson. Wow.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|A Bruce Willis sellout...this was one of those movies where the actors just stand about with nothing much to say or do. They just made the movie for the money. If it was supposed to introduce the &#34;next Die Hard hero&#34; they failed. Jai Courtney didn't do much either. I might watch one with him in it just to see if it is any good, but if it isn't great, I will not watch another. He just doesn't seem to have the personality and humor of Bruce Willis, which is a good part of the fun of the movies.<br />Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was frustrating to know that I will have to wait until next March to see the next episode!<br />Excellent!
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Murder, mystery, intrigue, and based on a true story, this book is set in China, complete with old Chinese men walking their birds at dawn.  Great read.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This is an amazing movie, give it a chance. Tom Cruise did justice with this movie, I loved the visual effects.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot explains why and how the religion practiced by today's so-called Christians has nothing at all to do with the man known as Jesus of Nazareth.
0399255370|5.0|Great book illustrated by Oliver Jeffers, funny and with a message. Kids will have fun reading it over and over.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The hero may not be considered a hero at all.  He involves children in illegal activities for his benefit.<br />The story is also a little far-fetched and some accomplishments by the hero are hardly possible.<br />But, it is well done and very entertaining
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Float like a monkey, sting like a monkey! Simple fun. Not a lot of variation in the first five levels, at least, but pretty.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|excellent game! it challenges you to think of new ways to go thru the maze and solve each level. It amazes me how good the mind works on simple game like this one. excellent!!!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|What do you get when you put together Sylvester Stalone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Coture, Liem Helmsworth, Terry Crews, and Scott Adkins? The second most horribly cheesy ridiculous action movie. Oh the first? Duh Expendables one. I sure hope three is on the way! My only real complaint SPOILER ALERT, was that Van Damme never went into a full split.<br />I have some creative input for the next one, they should equip the guys with wheel chairs that have multiple weapons systems and have the guys pause mid-mission to pee due to prostrate problems.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|this game is awesome! it makes you thing and challenges your mind on ways to beat each puzzle. azada is a Wonderful game for all ages as you go to each level you will at first think I will not be able to beat it! but after a few tries it's like magic! you solve it!!! there are one or two that made me really think and work at it. I just love this game!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Sad, sad Afganhistan. Brings out your emotions, especially when it doesn't appear to have changed much to this day. Is it even possible to ever change?
039334505X|5.0|I'm no English scholar and I'm not a book critic, so when I say the writing is nearly flawless, I'm talking about for my tastes only. This book is mesmerizing. I've read nearly all Irvine Welsh's books and this one is, by far, my favorite.  Hilarious and laugh-out-loud funny one paragraph, then sad and depressing the next.  Irvine is so descriptive when writing about heroin and its euphoric effects that I want to try it myself to see if it feels as good as he describes.  Then when he describes the sickness of withdrawal, that clears that desire right up.  Love this book.
0767836324|5.0|Bought for the grandkids when the are over,they loved it! Its better than some of the other stuff on tv.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|This may very well be the best made for TV program to exist. It is a story that you will have to pay attention to as it has many characters and many plot points all happening at once. I would not reccomend this for the kids or anyone with an aversion to blood, sex and nudity because it exists in abundance. It is important to note that it never feels gratuitious but seems appropriate for the story being told and.. what.. a.. story.. it ..is! Truly amazing writing, great actors and beyond exceptional production quality. The visuals on Blu ray are just awesome to behold! You will quickly learn that the show is not affraid to kill off major characters that you have grown to like at any given moment which on more than one occassion left me jaw gaping shocked. Game of Thrones never ceased to surpise and amaze me. A must watch title that is easily worth the price of admission for the Blurays to see this epic in all its 1080P glory!
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|This movie played so fast and loose with FSFitzgerald was unbelievably shallow in its treatment of complex characters, focused on the show rather than the story and the wonderful characters.
193700788X|1.0|There are no words to express my disappointment. The characters are nothing like what we've read up until the last couple of books, by the end I find myself hating every single one of them, especially Sookie. This is not the girl we've all come to love, this is an annoying brat with zero interesting qualities.<br />She should have died at the end, then I would been a tiny bit less let down.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very easy read and full of great info on presidents.  Very surprising and informative, gives lots of insight into what presidents go through and how they rely on past presidents for all types of help.  Five stars!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I absolutely loved this series as much as 50 Shades!  I have read another Sylvia Day book, and her writing is wonderful!  Well done!
B005RZ8W94|5.0|The DVD picture quality and sound are great!  The case and cover art are as well, great price and super fast US Postal Service shipping.  If you like Volbeats 4th album, buy this!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show out there!!! The acting is superb, especially Maggie Smith. Really looking forward to the upcoming season and all the other twists and turns.
B002XXPNXG|1.0|I kept waiting for something to happen....................and it never did.  It was very disappointing and I sat through the whole thing, then questioned my sanity for doing so.
B003PWPGT0|5.0|This Album is so amazing... the pure soul and fun that was poured into this can be felt easily, even by those who are not music afficianados. the tracks go from blues to folk to reggae-ish, and the culmination of the whole album comes in the ending song, Good enough, a song so simple in idea, yet so complex to play, is really something special. This album is just that- good enough, and a heck of a lot more.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Whew! This dvd will kick your ass! It's all about dedication and motivation. YOU have to be the one to get up everyday (muscles aching) and whoop your own ass though. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is not just for women. I have enjoyed each season of Downton Abbey. I am looking forward to the next season.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|After watching the first few episodes, I was hooked. This is a great super hero show with excellent fight scenes and an impressive cast.  I had never seen most of the actors or actresses so I was worried, at first.  But once everyone got their roles ironed out, they gave incredible performances.  I thought Stephan Amell (Oliver) accurately portrayed a cast away survivor with PTSD very convincingly.  And I was pleasantly surprised with Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity, the IT support for Oliver's team, as well as a good friend. I could go on, most of the rest of the cast does very well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great action TV show with a great storyline and if you love vigilante justice, then this is the show for you.  Green Arrow puts down criminals hard and they don't generally get back up again. Definitely worth buying.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Great modern day Romeo & Juliet story (you didn't pick this up?) with a zombie twist. Very enjoyable and keeps a smile on your face.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, set in a perfectly ordered society, calls into question how much freedom are we willing to sacrifice for an orderly life. Removing feelings of love and choice by exchanging them for peace and harmony causes the reader to internally debate how much he or she would give up.  Then you wonder if seeing beyond is a gift or curse. Would anyone accept the responsibility of being the keeper.
082300659X|1.0|...drably illustrated, not much substance, simply boring. As is now usual, this is basically a ttribute to the author's own work.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|For starters, what a relief not to be stuck in self-indulgent, navel-gazing New York!<br />Centering the story around strong, capable, conflicted women -- in other words, real people -- is another big relief. Alicia, the main character, is bright and strong, also amazingly lucky -- this *IS* TV, after all -- and the things that confound her (conflicting emotions, uncertainty about how to relate to a man who has betrayed her) are not that far outside our own experience. Mr. Big, her husband, is the same lovable jerk he was in Sex and the City. Kalinda is wonderful: gorgeous, ruthless, tough.<br />The series is compelling, and I know I will be devastated when we use it all up.<br />Finally: what a DELIGHT to watch interesting drama without the constant annoyance and interruption of advertising. Thank you, Amazon!
B000002VCZ|4.0|A CD I had on Vinyl, but lost when I switched to all CD and vinyl was too scratched to transfer to CD.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|So suspenseful. love this series. Always been a Kevin Bacon fan but this is so intense. Love this and all the actors are terrific
B000002VE7|4.0|A CD I once had on Vinyl, but was lost when I switched to CD and the vinyl was too scratched to transfer to CD
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|Kinda entertaining for 5-10 minutes?  Even though there's customizing, and training, and opponents, etc.. it still feels VERY one dimensional.  All that is a wash as soon as a match starts.  Each game played is the same repetitive thing.  Keep pressing the one punch button until the opponent blocks, then block theirs and start punching again.  Tap right a bunch... Hold/Tap left a bunch..  And there's always a spin 'challenge' each fight..<br /><br />Graphics are good but that doesn't make it a good game.  Game play should be more complex.  This will bore all demographics, any age after 10 minutes.  All the training is pointless, as it pretty much keeps you at the same pace as your next competitor.  And there's no indication of whether each training sesson is affected by how much effort you put in.  (When it starts, you could spin the wheel fast or slow and there's no difference).<br /><br />To make the game somewhat interesting, it needs more controls.  More difficulties.  Make this design 'easy'.  Extra difficulties should offer more controls, and harder opponents.  I'm 19-0, and could keep winning with my eyes closed.  Each and every fight is exactly the same!  Each opponent should have a signature move that you haven't yet seen, which requires figuring out how to defend against.. think good old punch out on Nintendo).
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|IF YOU ARE A PINK FLOYD FAN, A.P.P. will tweek your knob. Alan was the engineer on several of Floyd's early albums, including Dark Side of the Moon. One of the all time best selling albums, Floyd made millions, but Alan got paid 80 cents an hour for his imaginative mixing and work on Dark Side. So, he split off on his own. BUT, I have \\"heard\\" that he's done the Same Thing, to Eric Wolfson, the male singer you hear throughout Alan's music, paid him by the \\"hour\\". Not sure if it's true, just \\"heard\\" it. Greed. I bought this YEARS ago in Vinyl, then had the 8-Track stolen. The first CD, also eventually vanished, leaving an empty case. Rather than buy the MP3, I bought the CD and will hopefully keep it longer than before.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BIngo is always a fun game. The musical background gives the game  a less boring  atmosphere. It s  fun and moves quickly.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Sometimes one enjoys playing a mindless game just to pass time ...and enjoy doing a little bit of a no challenge quiet.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is my favorite game ,however, I prefer to play it with 2 suits rather than one. The game is much more of a challenge<br />than with one suit.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Eh this book was just ok nothing to write home about on this book. What ya going do for me I moved on to the next book since this was kinda slow
B003WUYRGI|2.0|It is a great book for kid to  learn English and  read more information for kid to listen to u

B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I'm just a small musician and I do some dj jobs on the side and honestly I find this to be a great app works great and does everything u need for the most part obviously for anyone looking to become a serious dj u prob wanna spend slot more money on equipment but if it just small time and do it as a hobby it's great
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|Could not get it to work.  The program just spun and spun.  I tend to be a patient person but, with this, my patience ran out.  I ended up removing it from my Kindle Fire HD.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|very addictive and lots of fun. My sister introduced me to the game and I<br /> cannot stop playing. you must try it
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|The idea is good but the stars do not react based on what I tell them to do, where I direct them.  To some degree, they do what they want.  I found it not challenging and a waste of time.  If I am going to play a game that is supposed to be challenging, it should work right.  This did not, on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|I love more stuff! More More More! Extras, demos, live performances, remastered audio, art, explanantions. Thank you thank you thank you!. If you can afford this box set, buy it.
B00004XQ83|4.0|This album leaves out some of the more memorable songs in the show.  What there is is great.  Very enjoyable.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|Easily one of my favorite movies. The first Bluray was heavily criticized. This release slightly improves the picture, and the Audio is about the same as the first bluray. Not the greatest, but I'll take it and not complain.
1878424114|5.0|This is a book I have read and reread since 1991. It is one of those books that you take with you and share with others. It is step by step intervention on how to feel successful/happy even if donkeys are falling from the skies with shit sandwiched taped to them...You feel good...successful...happy...regardless.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Great extra- bonus tracks! Some of the tracks you may recognize from Pastichio Medley. I don't know what else to say except triumphant! I have been waiting years to hear full tracks of songs I'd only heard 10 second clips of before. The Smashing Pumpkins created so much music which never got released until now. This gives a glimpse into directions which they could have gone. I contend they could have had 6 more solid albums worth of music, had they had the time and interest.<br /><br />And obviously, the newly remastered double album sounds better than ever. I like the extra art and explanations, but the real treasure here is the vast amount of music on this box set.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It works fine, I just didn't realize it was the same power cord I already had!  I took it to work, so it's fine.
B00DNO3JUI|5.0|I was impressed all around by this beautiful and delightful film.  The scenery is dazzling, as is the acting, particularly Holly Hunter's.  The film is at many angles about the human condition, determination, and the depths of human passion, all said through a chapter in the life of a woman, young and a mother as well, whose love for a piano recognizes no boundaries.  I highly recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|GREAT SET OF BOOKS FOR CHILDREN LEARNING TO READ... THERE ARE THREE BOOKS... AND NOW THEY COME IN A BOX...<br /><br />I RECOMMEND JUST THE PLAIN BOOK SETS... BUT READING IS REQUIRED FOR MY CHILD'S SCHOOL... AND EACH CHILD HAS HIS OWN BOOK SET...<br /><br />ENJOY... I KNOW YOU WILL!!!
1451696191|5.0|first the book is amazing and then second the quality of the book is amazing too so altogether it's just perfect
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Such a heroin and inspiring read. Thank you for your service and telling this amazing story.  Thank you to all the seals.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am so into this series that I keep it on my kindle fire and rewatch various episodes from time to time. The characters are perfectly cast. The castle is fascinating and beautiful down to the paintings and furnishings. I would dare anyone to watch it and not become totally involved in the lives of all the members-it is wonderful!!!!
1601251505|4.0|The book arrived promptly and safely, but the packaging left plenty to be desired. There was no padding or waterproofing whatsoever.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|It's like backflip is trying to make you not want to play. Let me give you an example,I was really good at the game I had 4 rainbow dragons a spring and getting a summer<br />and some more,but then I updated the game and had to give them my date of birth. So I did. Well they made me restart the game. So I guess what I'm trying to say is don't get the game unless you feel like it'll be worth it which it won't .DON'T GET THE GAME
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This novel is spellbinding. I couldn't put it down. Adiche is a wonderful storyteller! Her fusion of colonialism and feminist theology is unmatched.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Mincemeat is a good game but it has alot  of glitches like when u connect in with someone it doesn't let you  kill any animals and don't let u enter the chest then you get hit for no reason and when u connect in with someone u die in survival then you have to respond it's a pain in the Butt.ii
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|OK story line.  Held my interest.  Really nothing like the original.  Seems like they tried to squeeze in too much in a little amount of time.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Similar to Tetris that I played for hours.  Now I have yet another game to play to keep my mind working.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|The carrying case is very attractive and handy for wherever you are, as well as protecting the Kindle from unwanted scratches.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This was an amazing series. I am now on the final season and very very sad the show has ended!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I'm no pro at photo editing, but this app sure makes it easy. It does a lot that light room does, only easier. Really glad I found it.  LOVE IT!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've worked many years in a hospital and saw things that can't be &#34;explained&#34;, mostly because there are no words that you could use to make anyone understand.

052118939X|5.0|I find this book excellent for everyone who want to learn grammar. The excersices help you to understand grammar phenomenon. i find this book in this site  [...] which help me to choose book
1250012570|4.0|9/10 on [...]<br /><br />It starts in the 70s with chubby, red-headed Eleanor and scrawny half Asian half Irish Park. Both are awkward, as are most teenagers, and both want to hide from the classically horrible, hierarchical high school dangers that involve bullying jocks and their conniving girlfriends. Really--the girlfriends are total bi--well, you get the point. It's tough!<br /><br />Park, relying on a childhood friendship and the fact that he's always been there, in the background, gets on with school, relatively unharmed. However, poor Eleanor (no, she really is monetarily poor) is new to this school--returning home after, we later learn, her step father kicked her out of the home for a year. She struggles with making friends, not being able to bathe properly, ill-fitting clothes--oh, and finding a seat on the bus where everyone knows their place.<br /><br />Luckily for her, this weird kid who doesn't say anything (Park) slides over and lets her sit next to him. Several awkward weeks later, Eleanor and Park develop a sort-of friendship, reading the same books and eventually talking.<br /><br />What follows is a romance dreamed in every 16-year-olds heads. They fall madly. Deeply. Head-over-heels in L-O-V-E. To the casual reader this may seem too fast (in fact, the book itself references Romeo and Juliette on many occasions). To those that hang onto every word that Rainbow has written, that savor every small line and reread pages to get the full effect--this is meant to be. It's real. This is the one. The ideal romantic pair.<br /><br />Their love is beautiful because they are so passionate but so shy--they want to explore and develop but both are too afraid of going beyond the holding hands or stolen kisses because--what if Park thinks Eleanor is fat? Or what if Eleanor thinks Park is too scrawny?<br /><br />You get in both teens head and know about the all-consuming love they feel for each other and their own insecurities. It's beautiful.<br /><br />I don'twant to go into too much detail about the book because this is one I really think people should pick up and read (and this post is already long!) but I do want to make a few more notes:<br /><br />I love the complexity of the characters. You want to hate Tina (one of the afore mentioned dreaded girlfriends) and her friends, but as the story continues, you learn more about Tina and she actually redeems herself close to the conclusion. If anything, she is one character that can fully understand Eleanor and her situation.<br /><br />On the flip side, Eleanor's mother is not just a meek, abused woman. She is so unique and conflicted. I hate the relationship she and Eleanor have during the time of the book but I don't hate her. Nor do I really like her. She is too many shades of grey for me to have an opinion--however, I feel I fully know (if not understand--who could?) her character.<br /><br />There were a few negative parts I want to mention (and these are the points off in my 9/10 rating) And SPOILERS:<br /><br />The mystery--who is writing lewd comments on Eleanor's books? It turns out it's her step father. However, I didn't understand if he was thinking sexual thoughts about Eleanor, or if he had acted on them with her younger sister, or what the whole situation was. It could have been that he just wanted to chip away at Eleanor and try to drive her away from home (You know, no friends, being bullied, terrible home life)... but not sure.<br /><br />Also, I was confused why at the end she doesn't open the envelopes that Park sends her. I could see Eleanor not responding, but she could have looked at them. Just an opinion--it doesn't not fit her character, but it also doesn't fit.<br /><br />Finally, why did this take place in the 70s? I haven't actually researched any articles where Rainbow discusses this, so she may have a perfectly legit reason, I just don't know it. It could have been because the lack of cell phones.<br /><br />There is so much more I could talkabout--their amazing teacher, Romeo and Juliette, superheroes and the use of comic books, Eleanor's siblings, Park's parents (who are amazing by the way), Park's grandparents, poverty, abuse, self-perception--you get the idea.<br /><br />This book is loaded with discussion topics and so brilliantly written that I would recommend this for all.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The working relationship between Harvey and Mike is a study in human interaction.  The attorneys are cutthroat politicians, not unlike the real world.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a great series. it's too bad there are so few episodes to each season, though I understand, since episode is 1 1/2 hrs. In eight.
0811875040|2.0|Let me preface this review and explain that I am a very experienced home cook and baker and have an extensive cookbook collection.    Miette was an impulse purchase at Costco. I was attracted to this book for the following reasons: the scalloped end pages (charming), size (relatively small and very manageable), photographs (beautiful), layout, sewn binding and not glued (wish more publishers would do this), and I was familiar with the bakery having visited it many times. At first sight it is a beautiful little book.    Baking from this book is another thing. This is one of the worst written cookbooks I have seen. I suspect that the errata page--provided by the publisher on their Web site--doesn't even touch the surface. (Note: The copy I bought at Costco is the 6th printing and reflects all the corrections listed on the errata page.)    Baking is a science that requires precise ingredient listings and instructions. This book fails miserably on that count. A quote from the errata page alerts you to what is ahead: \\"Throughout this book, there are inconsistencies in the weight of flour and sugar measurements. Please apply the following measurements...\\"    In the acknowledgments the author amazingly states, \\"Infinite gratitude goes to Nancy Kajiyama, the force behind every product at Miette and whose perfectionism is seen on the pages of this book. She tested each recipe for accuracy and made sure the directions are clear and concise...\\" Accuracy, clear, and concise are not words that should be used to describe this book's recipes. Whether the author, Kajiyama, the copy editor, or the typesetter are to blame for the numerous errors in this book is unknown to the reader. And frankly we don't care to know where true blame lies. We want recipes that are easy to follow and result in a successful finished product. That is not too much to ask of a cookbook.    I attempted the Hot Milk Cake recipe twice and both times resulted in a cake that was fallen in the middle. The firstattempt was done in a gas oven and monitored with an oven thermometer. The second attempt was done in a convection oven resulting in an identical fallen cake. I was also irritated to read in the ingredient list that the unsalted butter should be room temperature (which is usually the case for a cake in which butter and sugar are creamed) only to be instructed to melt the butter with the hot milk. The book is riddled with similar head scratching nonsense.    A major problem with this book is the author's insistence on making cakes that require a 6-inch round pan with removable bottom when 9-inch pans are standard in the home kitchen. While the precious 6-inch cakes in Ray's bakery are the norm, the home baker has little use for a petite cake that requires special equipment. Furthermore, the cake recipes generally yield two cakes when only one is needed for the recipe. The author suggests you freeze one for later use. I am sorry, but home bakers do not operate this way--at least I do not want to.    While the photographs are beautiful even they can leave you wondering. The Chocolate Wafer Cookies pictured on page 126 are studded with tiny holes similar to those often depicted in photographs of shortbread cookies, yet there is no mention in the instructions of this step. It is the same with the Graham Crackers recipe on page 151. The Bûche de Noël cake (page 74) is a holiday show stopper confection. If there is any cake that should have a photograph provided for the baker it is this one. The author even states in the sidebar. \\"This cake is difficult to assemble, so you must space out the process. ...\\" Yet no photographs of either the process or the finished product are provided. This is a serious omission.    Chronicle Books is a respected publisher that produces very good cookbooks. There must be a back story on this book because it is certainly an anomaly in the publisher's list.  It is a shame because the bakery is a good bakery and I admire Ms. Ray, who is a self-taught baker, for taking on opening her own bakery in a challenging city with a lot of competition and making a success of it. This book and its recipes , however, were not ready for prime time.    Update: Before I throw this book in the garbage, has anyone found any recipes that actually work?
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that as soon as I  finished it I came back to buy book 2 & book 3. Bared to You is def worth the read!!!

B004ZNB12O|3.0|I guess my opinions are prejudiced as a long time PF fan. But if you have a choice, go with the two disc Echoes or my personal favorite pf compilation, Works. I suppose this will work for the casual fan, for the hardcore fans, it leaves a lot to be desired. When are these guys gonna release some previously unreleased stuff?? (EMI are you listening?? Is there anybody out there?? Please release Pink Floyd's BBC sessions!!)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|There are some nits to pick: no 5GHz WiFi, a USB port on the end so it almost undoubtedly will show around the side of your TV if it's below 50\\" in size, currently a low number of streaming options, and a few others.<br /><br />Whatever.<br /><br />It's a $35 dongle that won't take up any shelf space and which will allow you to watch your Google Play content on your TV. For that alone, it's well worth it. Note also that Netflix works great on it, as does YouTube, as does displaying Chrome tabs from your computer (Mac or PC). Other content is coming.<br /><br />If you already own a Roku or Apple TV, it's a much more marginal purchase unless you have a lot of Play content and/or want to show your Chrome tabs but don't have a Mac/Apple TV combo. Still, for $35, how wrong can you go? I use mine daily and am happy with it. I'll be happier once 5GHz is supported and once they move the micro USB port to the side, but I'm happy enough to heartily recommend this at the price.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game, however the dropped games started me losing money which was discouraging.  I hate the new enhancements as well.  I ended up deleting it off my device because of the issues.  I went from level 149 to 1.

B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|And yes it DOES matter!!  BUT, somehow, Blake gets away with it because he seemed to be in charge of this record, the direction of it, the feel, and selecting tracks that play into his personality like a glove or his beloved truck while going mudding or hunting.  He also gets away with it because he IS a songwriter himself, and knows himself better than anyone else, aside from Miranda and the rest of his family, so he has the ability to pick tracks that feel as if he wrote em himself, that play to his own style...and the record is quite consistent in style, honesty, personality, humour & heart...you really can't help but like the guy, like he's one of your best buddies busting yer chops while knocking back a beer or two.<br /><br />Now, I have to say, with country music, I prefer alt-country/Americana/rootsrock/countrypunk.No Depression/etc, and not the mainstream radio kind...aside from what I call \\"country powerpop\\", which focuses on rock & roll powerpop hooks with some twang for flavouring...Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, Sara Evans all fall into this category...Blake's \\"old lady\\" falls in the alternative category and I love her music to death...her own songwriting and taste in other alt-songwriters covers, like John Prine, Allison Moorer, Patty Griffin, etc...\\"Four The Record\\" is her best record yet & I love her work with the Pistol Annies too...Blake also popped on Miranda's bandmate Ashley Monroe's recent 2nd solo album \\"Like A Rose\\" on the funny duet \\"You Ain't Dolly (And You Ain't Porter)\\", AND his & Miranda's production job on their friend Neal McCoy's recent \\"XII\\" disc made that one GREAT, not good, and made me realize that Neal had something to him in addition to his good voice...<br /><br />Soooo, aside from Blake's fun appearances on The Voice and winning 3 times out of 4, he really knows what he is doing...he may have started out as just a radio guy appearing to be cookiecutter disposable...BUT he's really proving his mettle...he advanced to somewhere between country powerpop and something somewhat alternative...he's also pretty loyal, having 2 of his Voice teammates on this record too, with the amazing Gwen Sebastian duetting and the really great RaeLynn guesting with his Pistol Annies on the utterly fun \\"Boys Round Here\\"...I could do without the line \\"The boys round here send a prayer to the man upstairs\\" cuz I'm an atheist, BUT he doggone gets away with it, and the song is hilarious too...<br /><br />Overall, it's a VERY likeble record and is proving he is here to stay, with or without \\"The Voice\\"...een country powerpop and something somewhat alternative...he's also pretty loyal, having 2 of his Voice teammates on this record too, with the amazing Gwen Sebastian duetting and the really great RaeLynn guesting with his Pistol Annies on the utterly fun \\"Boys Round Here\\"...I could do without the line \\"The boys round here send a prayer to the man upstairs\\" cuz I'm an atheist, BUT he doggone gets away with it, and the song is hilarious too...<br /><br />Overall, it's a VERY likeble record and is proving he is here to stay, with or without \\"The Voice\\"...

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book with exciting and suspenseful story line. Can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what happens.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|To be honest, I found this book to be an interesting short story, with a boring filler in the middle that just happens to take up about over half of the book… Still I would recommend you to hang on and read it, maybe with skipping the middle part, so that you can go on and read the second book of the trilogy, which is in my opinion the best one of the &#34;Cold Equations&#34; trilogy.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|really enjoy the different puzzles in the game. its fun and keeps me entertained when I get some free time to play it. the graphics are amazing, and its not the same puzzles all the time.

I loved the fact that it filled the page nicely but I had to return the app within an hour of purchase since there is no way I can save my favorite songs. There were no buttons/sections indicating how to save the songs, unlike in the iPhone. Another thing that was annoying, I even went to the website and there was no help section regarding with app issues. I do have to commend Amazon's Customer service for prompt reply and resolution of my issue.

Finally Mel Schacher's bass is out front with the rest of the band instead of muffled in the mix.<br />Yes they are a little hot, but hey we are talking about Grand Funk Railroad it was meant to be hot! I mean after all the original albums said \\"Too Be Played Loud\\" So ditch all the other crap and buy the 2002 Remasters on Capitol, you won't regret it !!! Oh and why only  \\"On Time - We're An American Band\\" the boys (probably under pressure from the record label) started recording junk. Yeah there are some good songs on their later albums, but c'mon \\"The Locomotion\\" sucked. \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" was a good cover but still the music was suffering.

B0038ZITIE|4.0|I remember this movie from back when it came out. I really liked it back then.. I bought it recently to watch with my son after he saw the movie Ted. Looking at it now, like most sci fi movies it's corny but we enjoyed it anyway. I believe it was pretty low budget compared to a lot of movies back in the day but it's still interesting to see how far special effects have come since then. Overall, why not.. it was inexpensive and provided some laughs...

B00ECUARO8|1.0|The motion picture \\"Mud\\", is a constant reminder of bad story lines and terrible plots. First off was actor \\"Mathew McConaughey\\", who petraid a muderer on the run. The actor was hiding out on a river island, with a deserted boat in the trees and a history of plain boring. Two kids, portrayed by \\"Tye Sheridan (Ellis)and Jacob Lofland (neckbone)\\",  find him and help to get the boat water ready. Into the movie, the two boys come in contact with \\"Muds'\\" enemies and girlfriend. A truly long and boring movie indeed. The action scenes were as followed, Ellis is fourteen years old and punches another boy and Muds' victims brother. He gets snake bit and house boat shot up in the end. Mud saves Ellis and gets shot at in the end of the movie, gets wounded and miraculously shows up on the deserted boat headed for open water. All of this occurs within days, but drags out for hours. Thank God for dollar rentals, because if I had spent the movie theatre admission price of seeing this waste of film and time, I would've been very sick. The story line could've had more twists and turns. The actors themselves should've had better lines to read from and more coaching. A better plot would've improved the exhausting tasks of keeping my eyes open during the film. This movie reminds me of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\", in which it dictates the same boring story line and poor attempts at a plot. Unfortunately for myself, I guess giving actors and directors another chance at a good movie is simply impossible! I will spend my movie rental money next time on a cold soft drink and get better entertainment from watching the local news.

B0027UY8B8|5.0|I am rewatching the series now. It is an excellent series and if you haven't watched it, you really should! If it doesn't grab you in the first few episodes, please persevere. You will not regret it! The bluray transfer is great and it's especially great that it was shot in HD as well. There is a little grain in some of the shots but it's not bad for a TV series!
B001TH16DI|3.0|The movies themselves have an amazingly great picture, the the sound is not balanced well to normalize volume level. This results in frequent volume adjustments. The worst is at the beginning of every disk there are 2 ads that always play before you can get to the menu. I certainly do not purchase a movie to be forced to watch an ad for another every time I view it. These should have been placed under the special feature content and not a required viewing at the start of each disk.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Iain M. Banks' \\"The Hydrogen Sonata\\" is surprising in a couple of ways:<br /><br />- First, as noted in the title of my review, this book is actually enjoyable.  Don't get me wrong.  Most of the other Culture novels are technically well written and interesting to read.  But, usually, \\"enjoyable\\" is not the word that springs to mind when describing them.  They're more thought-provoking than enjoyable.<br />- Second, the main characters in this book aren't unduly flawed.  In general, with the rest of the series, the more central the character is, the more petty flaws he/she has.  This \\"likability\\" of the characters is part of the reason this book is so enjoyable.  Yes.  There are characters with flaws (particularly the main character's mother).  But, those flaws are far enough away from the story to mitigate them.  Of course, the primary antagonist has flaws.  But, then again, he's supposed to be the quasi-bad guy.  And his flaws aren't petty (so I find non-petty flaws in a character more acceptable than petty ones? -- that's an interesting concept).<br /><br />Of course, the book has some negatives.  Starting with the most trivial:<br /><br />- A lot of people die in this book.  Of course, a lot of people die in every one of the Culture books:  it's a recurring motif.<br />- The characters blurt out the F-word quite a bit.  It's surprising since I don't remember Banks doing this in the previous books.<br />- Quite a bit of the book consists of Culture Minds conversing.  For the most part, this is great since it gives a feel for those Minds.  But, their discussions read like threads in some internet forums:  they're snarky and snide.  It's not something you'd expect from artificial beings with gigantic brains.<br />- The book lacks a bit of the Culture feeling.  I think it's because the activities are being driven unofficially by those Minds and not via some kind of \\"official\\" direction through SC.<br />- Banks is probably doing this on purpose, but I've got a bit ofan issue with races Subliming.  It seems that any race can do so if they've got an advanced enough technology and are bored enough.  There doesn't seem to be any requirement that the race actually be adult or wise.  In this specific case, the society is no more sociologically advanced than ours.<br /><br />None of those negatives are very big.  So, I'm happy to rate the book at a Very Good, enjoyable 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />And, to make things easier to find, here are the Kindle versions of Banks' \\"Culture\\" books in order:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B0013TX6FI Consider Phlebas (Culture)]],<br />2.  [[ASIN:B002WM3HC2 The Player of Games (Orbit Books)]],<br />3.  [[ASIN:B00371V6PW The State of the Art]],<br />4.

B00CL8D83U|2.0|Obviously things have changed in the PSB world.  Elysium was a near total disaster, a contract-fulfilling debacle.  You had to figure that they used a bunch of leftovers for that album, and that they would simply use the next album for newer, better material.  Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case.  PSB used to take roughly three years to develop each new album.  That's a long time to wait, but it was almost invariably worth it.  To their great credit, they have generally avoided following short-lived fads in pop music.  Up until Elysium, I was convinced that they were sitting on a bottomless well of catchy, intelligent songs.  It looks like that well has begun to run dry.<br /><br />The biggest error, in my opinion, is continuing to hire outside producers.  When you do that, you wind up with somebody else's album that sounds like PSB, but really isn't.  Or what somebody thinks PSB should sound like.  It smacks of laziness -- it's like they want to quickly get a record out there, but avoid doing the work.  Until they go back to producing their own records, their music will continue to have very little identity.  (Duran Duran does this so they have new material to play in concert, yet their new albums are uniformly boring, produced by people who were the band's fans back in the day.)<br /><br />I strongly agree with others that this could (should?) be Disco 5.  Every track is a dance track, and most of them are propelled by overworked, stale trance concepts from the 1990s.  In fact, some of them sound like direct descendents of the songs on Relentless.  But at least that disc wasn't passed off as a whole new album.  There is no flow to Electric; it's just one thumping, fatiguing dancefloor number after another.  In that regard, it could be considered worse than Elysium.  Additionally, it is almost completely devoid of the fascinating, thoughtful lyrics we're used to.  Worse yet, Tennant's vocals are heavily processed on nearly every song.  Again, this should have been Disco 5.  We're still waiting for the next PSB album.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This would have been a 5 star rating EXCEPT, in a couple of the puzzles the proper place to tap on the picture could only be found by trial and error. In one place, I had the solution to the puzzle but it was only after multiple visits to the site did I happen by chance to tap the correct spot. Even after I tapped on the right place by accident I couldn't find anything that distinguished it from all other possible places to tap.<br /><br />A proper puzzle should never require a trila and error approach.
0307719219|5.0|This book answers an intriguing question with a persuasive concept.  Why are nations so strikingly unequal in their economic development?  My own preferences had mainly been Max Weber's cultural hypothesis (heck, who can beat European cultural ascension?) and also the climate theory, but the authors convinced me that I was sadly mistaken.  Inclusive economic and political conditions together with political centralization will outstrip any other socio-economic system.  Extractive institutions, as they call them, will cause stagnation and backwardness, and even where they have been temporarily successful as in Russia and China, they will eventually stagger.  The fear of \\"creative destruction\\" has sealed the economic fate of many countries which would have otherwise been in perfect shape to succeed.  Well conceived were the unforeseen events called \\"critical junctures\\" (e.g. the black death of 1347) and \\"contingencies\\", such as the destruction of the Spanish Armada, that shape history.  For the historian of particular interest is their elevation of England's Glorious Revolution of 1688 to a pivotal turn-around from authoritarian to pluralistic regimes and as the birthplace of the stupendous ascent of industrial and technological progress during the subsequent three centuries.  Granted, an editor would have been helpful, as one reviewer suggested, but just the same I laud both authors for the brilliance of their concept and the wide ranging evidence supporting it.
B00008LKDY|5.0|\\"Extreme inventiveness within a definite framework.\\"  So says Rachel Podger of this music, and she's right.  You can play through these twelve concertos at a sitting and not feel at all that it's \\"all the same.\\"  If you don't believe me, just play the slow movements of the Nos. 10, 11, and 12.  No more need be said.  And Podger's playing is simply beyond praise.  She deserves mention with, and perhaps in some cases surpasses, the achievements of golden girls like Hilary Hahn, Janine Jansen, and Julia Fischer.  She seems to be playing with complete abandon, and yet, for all the energy in those allegros, there is never a sense of loss of control.  Some of the credit for this goes to her accompanying band -- L'Arte Dei Suonatori, a Polish baroque group who are masters of their original instruments.  Without the smoothness of the modern instruments, they show none of the rawness and tentativeness of some of the earlier original instrument bands.  They play with force and passion and expressiveness, and Vivaldi's writing for them in this set of concertos is amazingly rich and diverse.  They can do percussive effects and even wind-like effects, and their lute and guitar work is superb, and is sometimes hauntingly brought in to sparely accompany the soloist.  The Channel Classics sound is very present -- I cut down my volume quite a bit -- but it's not cramped, and Podger's violin is placed perfectly in relation to it.  I enjoyed the old ASMF Vivaldi sets from Decca, with Marriner and Iona Brown, back in the '60s and '70s.  But this is on a different level of music making.
044661758X|4.0|The Concrete Blonde by Michael Connelly is a police investigation of a serial murder that takes place within a courtroom drama of a police office charged with an unlawful killing of a suspect during an encounter with a suspected serial killer.<br /><br />The story begins with detective Harry Bosch (Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective) on trial for murder of a suspect from several years ago. When he shot the suspect, he believed he was killing the known serial killer called the Dollmaker. The Dollmaker's widow sues Bosch in civil court for wrongful death and Bosch has to defend his actions in open court. Just as the trial starts another victim is discovered, and it looks like the victim was killed after Bosch killed the Dollmaker. This new victim was found sealed  in concrete and is dubbed the Concrete Blonde by the newspapers.<br /><br />Is it possible that Bosch killed the wrong man? Is the killer still working on killing new victims? Are there other bodies waiting to be found?<br /><br />This is a well crafted story with great characters. The story is a little dated, the most notable is the lack of cell phones, which could have changed the story slightly.

All of them are blessed with sweet vocal chord and are talented singers by birth. They usually sing to attract their respective mates in their youth, unite and give birth to baby Penguins. Main food of these Penguins is Fish, which is in scarcity in the sea (and they too ponder where all the fish go to) and for that all Adult Female Penguins go far off in deep sea to get their food. All the Penguin Community is facing this issue of starvation and scarcity of fish.<br />A young penguin Memphis sings and impresses his mate and thus a new couple is formed. A large number of Female Penguins are going to deep sea to get fish by leaving their families behind. Mrs Memphis also leaves her new laid egg and Memphis and goes with this group. While moving after her along with the egg, when there is a strong snow storm, Memphis slips the egg out of his grip and the egg jumps, bumps, stumbles and taps in the snow. This is how the hero inside learns Tap Dance. When Mumble's  mother comes back she is shocked to know about Memphis' act of carelessness. But a bigger shock is on the way and that is unlike other Penguins, Mumble can't sing and when he tries to sing, everyone is shocked by the way he tries to sing in his screaming and shrilling voice. The whole Penguin Community is shocked but amazed on the Mumble's tapping feet. The senior most Penguins seek evacuation of Mumble from the community, as he is different and not like them (can't sing sweetly). When Mumble is too young, sea hawks and eagles come to pick him up for their food, but Mumble's tap dance makes them run away without touching/hurting him.<br />Gloria is a female penguin born at the same time when Mumble is born. She is very beautiful and intelligent with a superb voice.<br />Mumble is given the graduation degree and then to test their skills senior Penguins want to test the younger graduates' skills by asking them to catch fish in the sea. Gloria, Mumble and many of his friends reach to a far off iceberg following fish, this iceberg is torn in two parts by a hammer head fish. On one part Mumble is left alone who jumps in the sea to find his friends, during this search a walrus gets after him and to save himself he reaches to another part of Antartica where he finds another community of Penguins, and wow! They don't sing, they too dance, tap dance like him. Here he meets Lovelace, his new Guru who knows the answers of all questions of this earth (and sea). But this Guru has an equation of taking one coin for each question from any one. Mumble's new friends got to know about where his parents live and they plan to go there. Mumble reaches there and now there are two groups of Penguins, one expert in singing and other in Tap Dance. Playing in the sea and searching for fish, Mumble and friends are attacked by a huge Whale and while saving himself Mumble goes far off in the Sea alone and is trapped by people. He is kept now in a big in-sea Aquarium which a  lot of children visit. Mumble is noticed and admired by visiting Public and authorities due to his unique Tap Dance talent and he is let back in Antarctica but now with a chip at his back so that scientists are able to track and trace him. Mumble reaches back to his family.<br />There is a huge uproar in UN regarding extinction of Penguins and study of cause comes out to be fishing in those Antarctic areas by ships due to which out of hunger Penguins are dying. And ultimately to balance the environment and ecosystem, it is decided that human beings will stop fishing in the sea areas falling near to Penguin communities.<br />And thus Mumble saves his community. And finally lives with Gloria.<br />About Movie<br />HAPPY FEET is an animated film from Dr. George Miller (Mad Max Films), abouta penguin, with (voice)cast of Nicole Kidman (Mumble's Mother), Brittany Murphy, Magda Szubanski, Elijah Wood (Mumble), Hugh Jackman (Mumble's Father, Memphis), and Robin Williams (Ramon and Lovelace).<br />My View Points:<br /> - The backgrounds look excellent.<br /> - The dance numbers are also great, and superbly choreographed, especially the number 'somebody to love''.<br /> - Penguins were really cute, looking warm, natural and fuzzy.<br /> - Action sequences are very good, the chase scenes under the ice particularly were well done and equally done are underwater scenes.<br /> - There is a slight flaw in the way real Penguins walked, as it was not original penguin's walk, it was men and women shaped like Penguins.<br /> - The movie is entertaining for kids but equally serious about conveying the message to Save and Balance Environment - Great comedy, fun action and music numbers are the big assets of this moviea penguin, with (voice)cast of Nicole Kidman (Mumble's Mother), Brittany Murphy, Magda Szubanski, Elijah Wood (Mumble), Hugh Jackman (Mumble's Father, Memphis), and Robin Williams (Ramon and Lovelace).<br />My View Points:<br /> - The backgrounds look excellent.<br /> - The dance numbers are also great, and superbly choreographed, especially the number 'somebody to love''.<br /> - Penguins were really cute, looking warm, natural and fuzzy.<br /> - Action sequences are very good, the chase scenes under the ice particularly were well done and equally done are underwater scenes.<br /> - There is a slight flaw in the way real Penguins walked, as it was not original penguin's walk, it was men and women shaped like Penguins.<br /> - The movie is entertaining for kids but equally serious about conveying the message to Save and Balance Environment - Great comedy, fun action and music numbers are the big assets of this movie

B00AQUHBWY|5.0|This is a good puzzle game. The pieces are a good size and the fact that you can upload images from the web is a plus.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you like rock music, this is a must see, especially if you like guitar based rock n' roll that's not over produced. Many bands recorded their legendary records at this now infamous studio. Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" was recorded here in addition to albums by Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Rage Against the Machine and so many others. I liked this documentary so much, I watched it a few times on Amazon Instant. Luckily, I have a Prime Account. This is Dave Grohl's love letter to Sound City. If there was no Sound City Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" may not have the same authentic sound that many people grew to love about the band.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I'm really impressed with this game. It is not overly difficult like some fighting games (in fact, it is dead simple), the graphics are decent for mobile, the game play is responsive and fluid and I find no bugs. The game lets you play it but you still need skills to rock the statistics. As a FAOTD this is a must have. For $3? Hmm... well that depends on how much you like games like this. I personally would not pay that much. It feels a bit high to me. Regardless, good game!<br /><br />APRIL 2, 2014 UPDATE: I checked this app thoroughly for safety and respect for privacy and it contains NO adware, spyware or analytics. It's perfectly safe to install. :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was amazing. It's not just for history buffs, but for anybody who appreciates a good laugh, a bit of suspense, and a couple tears. 11/22/63 touched my emotions on so many levels. Waiting for this amazing novel to become adapted for the big screen!

A destructor by nature.<br /><br />Background:<br />Place: Chicago<br />Year: 2035<br />Spooner is a super cop Detective with hi-fi car and other electronic gadgets. He dislikes robots and believes that robots can anytime misbehave and become a threat to humankind. He is a person with innumerate power and sharp skills. His basic reason for not trusting robots is connected to his childhood when he and his sister were drowning in their car in a river and the robot saved only him and let his sister drown because logically robot sensed that Spooner had more chances of survival that his sister. This incident keeps on disturbing him in his sleep in the form of a dream and haunts him.<br />Susan is working in USR laboratory where robots are made. She understands robots better than anyone and believes that robots are the best friends of mankind. She differs with Spooner on his distrust on robots.<br />Dr. Alfred is a Bio man who is at no. 2 in USR and is making a new breed of robots (NS-5) that can understand and serve mankind better than the earlier breeds. He believes in three basic principles of robotics:<br />1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br />2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br />3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law<br />Robertson is a pure business tycoon busy in creating robots and supplying in the market and growing his business day by day by introducing better and better robots. But in a way he wants to overpower all mankind through his robots power force. He is the creator of VIKI<br />Sonny is a robot with some exceptions. He has emotions, feelings and he dreams also.

He dreams that one day all robots will be misused by some selfish men and then another powerful man will come to save the robots and get them free for a better cause.<br />VIKI has no physical form. She is logic and exists just as a female face in air. She is the key who can make all robots to revolutionize one day and go against mankind.<br /><br />Storyline<br />Spooner gets a call from USR that Dr. Alfred has committed suicide. When he reaches there he smells something fishy that Dr. Alfred has not committed suicide but has been murdered and doubts zero down on a robot, Sonny. Gradually understands that Sonny is difference from other robots as he has emotions. Moreover it conflicts with the three principles of robots on which robots function. Still carries on his arguments with Dr. Calvin that robots are not safe to use. His conflict with Robertson gets serious over the issue of Sonny and ultimately Robertson orders Dr. Calvin to destroy Sonny.<br />Simultaneously Robertson assigns a task force of robots to destroy Spooner as Spooner is getting more and more into his business to understand what reallyhis goals are.<br />Now, Spooner, Calvin and Sonny are on one side as good guys. On the other side are VIKI, a huge task force of robots, and Robertson to destroy these three.<br />And ultimately Spooner destroys VIKI, Robertson.

B000HF6ZR0|1.0|The book was great.  Instead of just adapting the book to the screen, they cut out all the good parts of the book and replaced them with boring 'action' scenes and some moments of truly horrible acting.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It's only 5 bucks! With over 50 years of photography/instructor experience I can honestly say it's easy and intuitive producing great results. Customer service .... one day response to fix an android/Kindle &quot;glitch&quot;' Buy this program!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Game of thrones is the best series I've read/ watched in a while!! Although it is graphic, the story and scenery is well presented in the show and very well done! Thank you HBO!
1451696205|5.0|Beautiful story.  I recommend this book to all teenagers.  Lots of life lessons to be learned.  I was heartbroken but we are left with hope that he will be fine.
B0060FXDCG|3.0|not too bad to have the series for your movie collection.<br />Still wondering why it is taking so long to produce movies/cartoons of all the<br />old great comics...??
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not once did the story go in a direction I expected, and it's all the better for it. I want to read more of this world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, but does need better instructions on how to play. Brain teaser and keeps the mind thinking. Game goes quickly so I hope more levels come soon.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I ordered it, tried to download it, retried both again.  It says I have it, yet it is nowhere to be found on my Kindle.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|This game was lots of fun.  I love hidden object games.  Very interesting and challenging.  G5 always have the best hidden object games.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Amazing thing to consider the iconic albums that were recorded in that studio. Watch this video, you'll enjoy it if you are a music fan.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|at first I tried the free game, but then got addicted and downloaded the complete game. Love it. Just keep trying to complete all the levels. Only problem is that I don't understand what some of the icons are for, but still enjoy the game. I recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Need More ways to earn credits. Love that this on the kindle fire and my android phone.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This movie tried to take cloning and put a real spin on it. Too bad it fell off the table and on the floor sucking the life out of the viewer as it went. Not enough back story....to much Tom Cruise...Literally!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is lots of fun! Happy I got it! It really as mindless as you might think. Rather challenging really.
B001223BLU|5.0|I love all types of music, but the music from that time period is some of the greatest you can hear; very little manipulation by computers and dubbers.  You truly hear the singer, now what a tech things they should sound like, and it sounds good!!!
006097625X|5.0|McCloud distills decades of narrative study into a delightful reading experience.  If I were buying it again, I'd spring for the Hardcover edition.
B00957T6X6|3.0|I think the bundle is a good idea.  The only adverse thing I found extremely annoying is that every so often it was necessary to locate the last bookmark number because when I returned to start reading again it would start either at the beginning or at some arbitary point.  Since I have not experienced this with my other e-books I assume it may have to do with the bundling format.  I had intended initially to comment about the ending of book 5.  \\"This is how it ends\\". It wasn't until I retuned to ask that question that I found a mention in a review about other books as yet unwritten or to be published.  If I had been aware of this I would not have even started what I thought was a 5 book series.  It was not mentioned or in the fine print.  I still have bad memories of Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series.  To any readers who wish to start reading the \\"Game of Thrones\\" maybe wait until its completed.  I did like the story so far.  Think it could be a little shorter.  But now I have to wait for possible concluding books that will come when????
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This television series is fantastic! With so much Canadian creativity involved, I felt deeply proud of the talent found in my country. The cast is superb and Tatiana Maslany is a powerhouse. She is going to be a huge star.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I haven't read the books, but I have watched some of the episodes early on. I really enjoyed the visualizations conveyed in the series, and the story, translated from the books, is really immense and intriguing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love this story very much. The story is great, the heroin a great character and a fascinating world. Some of the characters - especially Lukas - are a bit thin and unbalanced but these are minor quibbles. If you like dystopian stories this is a must read.
1556347308|5.0|The portuguese edition is black and white. This one is gorgeous, the best rpg ever. Just buy it you wont regret it.<br />Reunite your friends and just lock and load.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|The track \\"Made up mind\\" carries on from where their last studio CD 'Revelator' left off - a swinging funky song with Susan belting out the vocals, Derek's wonderful slide guitar and the full band piling in behind them. \\"Do I look worried\\" is a more restrained song that slowly builds, with a great hook and some lovely guitar, were as \\"Idle wind\\" sounds like early Jethro Tull with its acoustic guitar and flute intro but that too builds with the brass joining the flute for some really nice lyrical ensemble playing. \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"Part of me\\" are more mid-tempo funk tracks with riffing brass and wah-wah guitar, while \\"It's so heavy\\" and \\"Sweet and low\\" are slow-burning soul ballads and \\"All that I need\\" is a melodic song that is half way between a ballad and one of the mid-tempo funk work outs. \\"The storm\\" begins with powerful guitar from Derek and the track finishes with an extended solo where he mixes blues slide with Indian raga. The album finishes with the beautiful \\"Calling out to you\\", a duet with Derek's fabulous acoustic slide guitar and Susan delivering bucolic hippy lyrics.<br /><br />There is some wonderful playing on this record and once again Susan's voice is absolutely sublime throughout but for me the record doesn't completely deliver on the promise of their debut CD. It must be really hard to come up with material that combines all 11 members of the band and even though they write songs with outside help from Doyle Bramhall, Sonja Kitchell, Oliver Wood and John Leventhal amongst others I did feel that some of the songs were a bit average and stuck in a 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen tribute band' mode. Despite Susan's wonderful vocals I did really enjoy trombonist Saunders Sermons sharing the vocals on \\"Part Of Me\\" and I still feel that Mike Mattinson is wasted just as a backing singer and think that he could have been given at least one song to sing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Not an overwhelming story line, but good action executed well!  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren - brilliant together.  Malkovich has great facial expressions for the crazy LSD guy!!!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It was a beautiful story in a gorgeous setting with wonderful characters and fabulous music! I watched it three times. Is one I may purchase.
B000059HB7|5.0|Almost all John Wayne movies are great but this is one of the best.  It's funny, tough, and a small love story all in one.  If you like westerns you will like this one.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, I need something like this when I'm watching football (snore) with my husband. This way we are together but I am enjoying myself too. Also great while waiting at the airport, or anytime really, it's just fun!
B009WUBERW|2.0|Not a huge fan of this type of stuff. Great action & adventure but I thought it was too predictable & phony. Did not catch the joke if there was any.
1573229725|5.0|Fingersmith isn't just a great novel for someone seeking a story exploring a lesbian relationship between two strong characters; it is a truly Great Novel -- a future classic -- worthy of study and consideration as an example of the best contemporary literature written in English. That is not to say it's for everyone -- I've scanned the existing reviews here. Some people do not enjoy this book one bit and feel it delivers less than it demands.<br /><br />So I will try to articulate what I like about the book; maybe you'll see something that resonates with you as a reason you'd enjoy it -- or a signal that you might be more likely to find it a waste of time.<br /><br />1) I really appreciate multi-dimensional, complex characters who are fleshed out with details of their thoughts and feeling so that they seem really human. If these elements of characterization often impact how much you enjoy a book, you would definitely find a lot to appreciate in Sarah Waters's work here.<br /><br />1a) If you furthermore have an appreciation of psychological novels where you get a really deep and nuanced understanding of how an individual character thinks and feels, you will probably really like this book. One of the primary features of this novel is that you experience the story from the perspective of each of the two main characters. These characters are tremendously interesting and incredibly well-developed. Sarah Waters really shows mastery, I think, in fascinating the reader with her depiction of her characters' consciousness -- the complexity, relatability, and strangeness of both characters is spellbinding.<br /><br />2) I agree with others who have said that if you really like Victorian novels, you're likely to enjoy this. If you never met a Victorian novel you liked and have sampled several from different authors, I'd say you are somewhat less likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />2a) But it's no Victorian novel; I know people who read nothing but mass market fiction and are not \\"literary\\" types who LOVED this book and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />3)I found the plot really, really delivered! There were many more unexpected twists and satisfyingly shocking, dramatic events in this book than in the lion's share of books I read. There will be moments that you won't want to put it down, I can pretty much guarantee. I didn't think it was ever slow moving in plot, but that's all relative. I don't know what feels too fast or slow for you. It's definitely a lot more action-packed and fast-moving than anything by Victorian novelists Eliot, Gaskell or Trollope, for example. Dickens is sometimes very fast moving with his plots so I can't really make the same comparison.<br /><br />In sum, I'd say this book:<br />--has a fascinating and original plot and narrative technique (the perspective switching, for example);<br />--does an outstanding job of depicting textured, complex and palpably human characters and relationships;<br />--is written as intricately and rigorously and beautifully to merit multiple close readings (if you're into that sort of thing ;).<br /><br />I hope this is helpful for at least some of you -- happy reading!re not \\"literary\\" types who LOVED this book and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />3)I found the plot really, really delivered!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Such a fun little game for the kindle fire.  It is smooth and easy.  Yes, there is one pop up at the beginning of each game, but it is simple to click \\"skip\\" and go on with your game.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|This is one seriously addictive game. It is a total blast.  The levels get more difficult so don't get too sure of yourself!
B00004U28G|5.0|This is a cross country race with a ton of stars and hot cars.  You will laugh a lot.  It's very cool to see so many stars when they were younger.  And there is a surprise ending too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  I really appreciated the way the characters were tied together within the fabric of the story and how their lives played out over many years.
B00D41H2PS|2.0|Very hard to understand. Stuck in rooms without any hints or suggestions on what needs to be looked for. I am stuck and feel that even though this was inexpensice was a waste of my money. As I probably won't play this again.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|While the characters are compelling,  I really enjoyed the setting Cassandra Clare built in her book.  The idea of taking various mythos and working them in as related to Angels and Demons was a fun twist.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If you haven't seen the film of this event, you can visualize the energy and communication of these amazing musicians. Fun, foot stomping, reverential and educational. What more could you ask for. I am grateful to the vision and musicianship of Joe Bonamassa and have shared my joy with many, many others.
B0040I09RM|2.0|I am sure this show is liked by many people but it just wasn't my type of TV, as I prefer dramas with a little less violence.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I love the canon that has developed throughout the years. I started<br />watching the show and movie in the mid 90's and loved the character<br />development that ensued.<br /><br />SG-1 has a really engaging storyline that pull you into the action and tells<br />a the story very well. I would recommend it a hundred fold over the reality TV<br />garbage that seems to perpetuate television these days.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the ease of being able to download a book from my cloud and pick up where I left off.  It is great for the times I wasn't expecting some down time.  I wish it loaded faster but maybe that is my phone and not the app.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I would like hints as to where to go, or suggestions on what needs to be looked for. I click on items and then not sure what to do as there isn't any type of instructions or clues. I am stuck and I have tried everything and nothing works. I do love the graphics.
B008B3F38C|5.0|Delain has become one of my favorite symphonic metal bands. I was a little worried when they released &#34;We Are The Others&#34; since &#34;April Rain&#34; was so good. I had some anxiety that they wouldn't be able to put out something fresh, something that wasn't just a repeat of what they did on &#34;April Rain.&#34; But they delivered! This album is unique and powerful, not only instrumentally, but lyrically.<br /><br />Songs that stand out on this album include &#34;Mother Machine&#34; with its chugging guitars and Charlotte's angelic voice overlaying the chaos behind her. &#34;We Are The Others&#34; which is a tribute to Sophie Lancaster and the tragedy of her death. It is also a declaration that lets the world know that we need to learn to accept the differences we see in others. &#34;Are You Done With Me&#34; is a great, poppy sounding song that really showcases the diversity of Delain as a whole.<br /><br />I would give the album six stars if I could, it is excellent. Buy it and fill your eardrums with awesomeness!

0307719774|4.0|The journal was bought as a gift, and was loved, so I have no qualms about the product itself.  The concept is one that is very unique and seems like a great way to see how you change through the years.  (Now, as to whether or not the journal will be consistently used everyday for 5 years - we'll see how that goes).<br /><br />The book itself has extremely sharp corners, which gives it a nice clean look, but it hurts if you somehow jab yourself with it.  Additionally, a couple of the corners were a little bent/banged when it came in the mail.  That wouldn't be a problem if the others weren't so sharp by contrast.  (I returned this book to a local Barnes & Nobles and got a fresh one with new corners since it was a gift.)
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I've been a Mayer fan since the beginning of time. I feel Mr. Mayer has changed and followed a different path with each album he has created and this one is no acceptation. While I hear a lot of fans complain they want the \\"OLD\\" music back I feel true fans grow with the artist and the direction of the music they share. Yes this is similar to Born & Raised with a country feel but it's fantastic. I enjoy each album in a different way and truly love this one just as much. Defiantly a must add to your music collection.

B002WV5A9G|1.0|This movie does a good job of hiring a bunch of people who could, plausibly, be Kirk, Spock, Sulu, etc.<br /><br />It goes off the rails after about five minutes, though, falling into unintentional satire by becoming essentially galaxy quest 2 without the self-awareness.  If you have 10 dollars, I'd recommend buying one of the older movies.  They're actually more entertaining unless you typically watch Kung Fu Theater with the sound turned off.

B00DGRCA4I|4.0|The reviews / comments that are posted here are ones pertaining to the original boxed set issued on the MCA label in 2000. That set has now been out of print for several years. We now see that the Sony label has scheduled a reissue of it for late August of 2013. It is significant to note however that the 2013 reissueas announced, was said not to be exactly the same as the original 2000 edition. Several additional so-called \\"new\\" tracks have already been announced as being added and it remains to be seen which, if any tracks from the original will be omitted to make room for them. It is also unclear if the 1969 Royal Albert Hall cuts which were on the 2000 edition will be included on this revised version in light of the new round of legal wrangling over the ownership rights to the Albert Hall tapes.<br /><br />Either way though, Amazon has simply appended (as they often do with multiple editions) all of the original reviews from the 2000 edition onto this newer page which purports to be \\"reviews\\" of the not-even-yet-released 2013 revised edition. Caveat emptor.

0307341577|4.0|I love Gillian Flynn, and liked Sharp Objects better, but overall this was another good book from this author.  The story is a bit slower to start than normal, and the story seems to move more slowly, but it has great character development and an unexpected ending.  If you enjoy Flynn's other books I would definitely recommend.

Highly recommended for travelers, though keep in mind you must pay for the downloadable maps that you can use without internet connection.
0765365278|2.0|I'll admit up front that I didn't finish this book. The reason I purchased it was because it was recommended to me as a fan of Robert Jordan. I loved the five-or-so books in his Wheel of Time series. I was ready to lose myself in a new fantasy world and I figured if Jordan trusted this guy to finish off his baby, he was a sure bet. I wanted to enjoy this book. I *really* wanted to. I read over 600 pages before I just couldn't stave the apathy off any longer.<br /><br />Sanderson's prose is competent. He plays it too safe to be a great writer, but he is quite good. The main characters are well written and believable, some are more interesting than others. The setting was fussed over a great deal, which should be a good thing, but I found myself unable to really lose myself into his world because it was so peculiar. One thing that I think compounded this problem was how he allots so much verbiage to describing every tiny detail of the world, its various environments, the people and all their different cultures, and even the evolutionary process that made certain creatures the way they are...but when it comes to soulcasting (Sanderson's brand of magic), next to nothing is said. Magic falls out of the sky and goes into rocks, then rocks are magic batteries. Soulcasting just seems like some bolt-on plot device that was really only there because fantasy is supposed to have some flavor of magic in it.<br /><br />To be honest, I would have gladly looked past those minor criticisms, but the main problem I had was the story just didn't go anywhere. Aside from one or two exciting scenes with the assassin character and his \\"lashing\\" fights, nothing really happens. In 600 pages, the main character transitions from a slave wagon to a war camp. The secondary character transitions from a boat to a building. None of the other characters transition anywhere. That seemed really weird to me. The story spent so much time bouncing around between different characters that it was impossible to truly invest in any of them. And when Sanderson did focus on Kaladin, the protagonist (I think?) specifically, it was anyone's guess whether you were going to be reading about his childhood, his young adulthood, or his present time. In 600 pages, I still had not been introduced to a proper antagonist. The core of the narrative takes place around a war that nobody seems to know the true purpose or cause of. After 600 pages, that information still hadn't been divulged.<br /><br />It's entirely possible that Sanderson addresses all these criticisms in the last 300 pages of his book. I honestly felt bad for giving up. Not only because I wanted to like the book but because I invested myself enough to read 600 pages. I pushed hard to make it that far, but I couldn't stand to read another page of a story that had no discernible purpose. If you read this, I'm really sorry Mr. Sanderson. I hate being so negative. At least you have a lot of really avid followers, and I respected that enough to give you more of a chance than I would have given an unrecommended author.e to truly invest in any of them.

0374530718|4.0|Sophie's World was certainly a very interesting novel that blurs the line between philosophy and fiction. In fact, it makes the reader wonder, \\"what is fiction?\\" apart from the other big question which is \\"what is philosophy?\\" I enjoyed reading the book but I took off one star because one of the most important/influential Western philosophers was glossed over: Nietzsche.<br /><br />I have my theories as to why. First of all, the book has a pro-God stance (seriously, it's very apparent and not at all subtle). Which is fine: I believe in a God but for those who don't, this book might be a turnoff. Makes me ponder if that is the reason the author glossed over Nietzsche?<br /><br />Perhaps the author found it controversial to talk about Nazism and Nietzsche, but it is an important topic to cover (you can't pretend unpleasant things never happened).<br /><br />All in all, I recommend the book (especially to teens). I think it will truly make you ponder the meaning of life and the characters of Sophie and Alberto were absolutely delightful. (Hilde and her father, on the other hand....)

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|im not a hardcore gamer, and beyond that, i'm not big on brand loyalties. so for me, i felt like it didnt make a whole lot of sense spending 100 bucks on a super mouse, when they all do basically the same thing. im friends with a lot of gamers, and they all have pretty expensive taste. with their rats, logitechs, razers, etc. but for a more casual gamer, i was looking for a bit less of an investment. i read countless reviews, and i waited a while before i finally pulled the trigger on this beauty, and as soon as i got it all programmed and tuned for how i wanted it, i was hooked. it has all the features of a gaming mouse that should cost at least double what i paid!!!<br /><br />its incredibly responsive, and the included driver software makes it easy to fully customize everything about your mouse to the smallest detail, and gives you all the freedom you could ever need.<br /><br />ergonomics are extremely important. it doesnt take a hardcore gamer to know that. anyone who spends a good amount of time on a computer will tell you that its better to have a comfortable mouse. the form factor is pretty basic compared to some of the other gaming mice out there, but thats not necessarily a bad thing! i think it fits the hand well, and its large skid feet and adjustable weight tuning make for a very smooth experience once you have it dialed in where you want it.<br /><br />the buttons have a satisfying click, which isnt too loud, and has a nice firm feel to it. all the buttons feel crisp, not gummy, and without being too hard too push or overly springy.<br />the scroll wheel is tight, and the rotation feels nice. i prefer smooth scroll wheels for more precise scrolling but it makes going through weapons while gaming very easy and fast, since you know one bump is a different weapon, so i overlook this as more of a feature than a hindrance.<br /><br />the lights are bright, but the brightness is adjustable, and the \\"breathing\\" effect is a nice touch, as well as the infinitecombo of colors makes customizing your mouse a lot of fun, and it makes it easy to match to your rig. the built in memory and 2 different programmable profiles come in handy not only for gaming, but it can also be used in drafting, and CAD design, for either moving over a large area very quickly, or instantly tuning way back for  those small, often hard to pinpoint details that can either make or break a part.<br /><br />in summary, whether you're mowing down hoards of enemies, creating a cad drawing, or casually surfing the net, this mouse will exceed your expectations, and from everything i've seen about the ankor brand, they care about your input, and will work with you to resolve any issues you may encounter quickly and easily.<br /><br />i would recommend this to anyone

0374533555|5.0|It is true that many of the ideas and a fair number of the examples will be familiar to anyone who has been reading science and tech sections of newspapers for the past twenty years. But by bringing all the interesting and quirky examples and studies into one tome, Kahneman tells the larger story of who we are, replacing the Manichaeism of good and evil with a Manichaeism of thinking fast and slow.<br /><br />What emerges is an evidence-based set of tenets for entirely new ethical and philosophical systems. (A friend of mine deep into philosophy stopped reading the book because he did not like how it deviated from classical philosophical approaches to understanding the self.) Rather than speculate on the nature of mind, we have piles of papers filled with repeatable experiments that show it to us. The later chapters and books such as Nudge and The Problem with Randomness already hint at how this new system might be applied to make the world a a better place. (Unfortunately savvy businesses and politicians, often through trial and error, have discovered a number of the ideas and already use them to sell things and ideas people do not really need).<br /><br />The main shortcoming is density. The cover blurb on my copy says \\"a lifetime's worth of wisdom\\". It does read that way. Chapters are like crowded cities, teeming with scientists and their subjects; the pages are bustling with examples and sample sizes and menageries of new terms (e.g. duration bias, availability bias, the mere presence effect, the endowment effect, illusory skills, duration neglect, the remembering self, etc). Rereading the book once may not be enough to absorb the examples and stories and numbers that tell us who we are. I'll probably have to reread it two or three times.<br /><br />Which is fine. Highly recommended.a number of the ideas and already use them to sell things and ideas people do not really need).<br /><br />The main shortcoming is density.

B002YDTPHA|2.0|By now, anyone who is not familiar with this series franchise, should not even be reading any of these reviews.  We all know the basic story and outline, what will happen, what does happen and how it cannot be avoided.  Number 4 in the series is no exception.<br />Number 1 was the best of them all; number 2 at least had Ali Lautner in it, although had a weak story; number 3 had the roller coaster and number 5 pulled all together. Number 4 (The Final Destination) is meaningless and bad. Why?  First off, the &#34;U.S' in this movie is actually Florida (thus so fitting for racing) as opposed to Vancover-ized version of the U.S.as in the other 4 movies. You have absolutely no connection with any of the characters, either because they just are all awful at their craft, or just because you have no empathy for them (the 4 leads are just stiff in their roles).The story is too convoluted in that it does not follow the structure of how premonitions and death work as opposed to the other 4 installments. It is the one movie that is left out there on its own, with no point of reference to the original movie in any way shape or form (the other 3 touch on Flight 180, or have Tony Todd in them to remind us).<br />I actually sat through this movie checking the remaining time left on my blu-ray player as to how much more of this I had to endure.<br />DO NOT use this as a starting off point for the franchise as it will disappoint. Buy the first one and then other 3 as they all connect. This is a &#34;stand alone&#34; movie whihc adds nothing to the franchise.

B006IVT8WQ|4.0|I have loved this movie franchise since the very start. I felt the original was a novel approach to &#34;horror&#34; with the &#34;murderer&#34; not being a person but an entity.  The subsequent movies were a let down as each had a diminishing story line in lieu of more ways that death could kill people, lesser known or talented actors as in the first and less believability and character cohesion.  Still, I would watch them for the entertainment value, more than any other &#34;shock&#34; value.  So, I purchased this to add to the collection, not expecting much, and for the most part that is what I received.  The acting was sub-par on all fronts, the story line was plausible but the death scenes were not (which is not to say using the opening bridge sequence was not a brilliant move as it was; it was the deaths afterwards that were foolish). There were continuity errors in some of the scenes and the cast just seemed like they were going through the motions.<br />So, why would I give it 4 stars?  I found it odd that this was &#34;set&#34; in NY as was the first movie (well, NY as seen through the eyes of Vancouver), and that Tony Todd was back in it after a two movie hiatus. I felt the franchise had come full circle. What I did not anticipate was the last 10 minutes of the movie.  My eyes and ears peaked each time I heard the word &#34;France or Paris&#34; and even more so, when I saw the &#34;Voulee Airlines&#34; jet. What happened next, while all the clues were there, was still a shocker. I felt like I was watching a Quentin Tarantino movie..it all came back to the start.  For that, and for solely that reason, I gave it a 4 star review.<br />The first installment of the franchise is still the best.

044024613X|5.0|The plot, characters, foreshadowing, all the guidelines good writers follow are applied in this book by this author. The premise of genetic disposition to violence is chilling, to say the least. Landay does a superb job of presenting the case, making us wonder if it is possible, even probable, in some instances. I read the book over a three day period, unable to put it down for long. It will not surprise me when some movie studio picks it up to make a thriller movie.  Excellent book!

0316044695|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I would recommend this book. The story that Marcus Luttrel has to tell is a compelling story of bravery, heroism, and survival of the highest caliber. He gives one the best accounts the seemingly impossible Navy SEAL training regiment that includes the infamous hell week during BUDS.<br /><br />However, there were a few things that I nit picked at (other readers may not care about this stuff as much as I did). Luttrel is a Navy SEAL, not a top caliber author. Some of the commentary may make you laugh, and sometimes it may strike you as unprofessional. Some of the background historical facts are a little off. Luttrel claims that SEAL's aren't in it for self gratification, however, there were parts of this book that I felt he was feeding part of his Texas ego. The constant liberal bashing gets old. I understood its placement on the first couple times, but it gets really annoying when he does it constantly. To me, it struck me as him searching for a scapegoat. Here I was hoping that these SEALs wouldn't kill a few civilians because they were civilians, but that was not the case. According to Luttrel, they didn't kill the civilians on the mountain because they were afraid of the big bad liberals back home branding them as murderers. It seems to me he was looking for a scapegoat to put the blame on when the decision ultimately belonged to his team. I also feel like there was a little embellishing that went on, but that only comes from my experience in reading other stories from other special forces soldiers (I am no expert). I would have enjoyed it more had he left out some of his social commentary and kept the account much more matter-of-fact.<br /><br />It's interesting to read this book, and other books by former Navy SEALs to see the wide spectrum of people that serve in our nations special forces community. Luttrel's s story is certainly on that should be told and read. I would recommend this book to anybody that has any interest in military or special forces accounts on modern battles. That being said, understand that Luttrel is a warrior first, author second.ilitary or special forces accounts on modern battles. That being said, understand that Luttrel is a warrior first, author second.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|So relaxing to watch, you want to go back to live with these characters. Clean enough for all of the family.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I like BBC television and have watch several programs. Lark Rise to Candleford is excellent and would highly recommend watching. The best thing is that it is in closed captioning which I really appreciate.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|After his stunning debut, \\"The Kite Runner\\", I found my favorite modern-day author in Hosseini.  His follow-up \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was another gripping and beautifully fleshed out portrait of characters that become imbued within a reader's memory bank, even heart.  That said, I was so excited to pick up his most recent work, \\"And The Mountains Echoed\\", sadly however, this book does not deliver the same emotional resonance as his previous offerings.  It does start off brilliantly and in classic Hosseini fashion, with luscious descriptions and tender but deeply felt prose, but once you reach the half-way point, something goes terribly wrong.  You no longer feel the weight of the characters in that you've lost touch with them and consequently, you also lose interest in how things play out.  Some of the characters are even obnoxious but not in an interesting way.  These fictional characters really feel fictitious and you become completely detached from their stories which at first started out so promising and intriguing (especially Pari & Abdullah).  Instead, you will now unwillingly read the book as an outsider looking in, and not as someone living through the eyes of these characters as you would have if you were reading \\"The Kite Runner\\", a book with absolutely no missteps and 100% soul.  I am sadly disappointed with this book, and have about 50 pages left, but can't seem to finish it.  It's taken me over a month, versus the one week it took me to finish \\"The Kite Runner\\".  I suppose this reluctance is a sad demonstration and quiet protest on my end, against a book that I really can't say I enjoy(ed).  I like being swallowed whole when I read a book, but this tease of a novel, chewed me up, and spit me back out.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a great book. I couldn't put it down. It even had me laughing at times. I would highly recommend this book.
B005IZLPME|4.0|Like I said, not much of a cap fan (Spidey fan) but I enjoyed this movie more than I anticipated but it's noting to get excited about. I'm not all too familiar with Cap's source material so without knowing what was faithful to the comics and what wasn't probably helped me enjoy the move more than comic purists.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Since my wife loves the movie, I love the purchase!  If you like this sort of story, I suppose it's great.  Not enough basketball for my tastes.
B000002J1M|5.0|Early Genesis in my opinion is some of the best combination of instrumental and vocal progressive rock there are other great bands but this music stands among the best.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard! The buttons are big and the auto corrector works well!  I also like that it can be personalized and tracks data on your typing!
2245267346|5.0|packaged in good condition, it was a brand new. and of course the book is gorgeous, I really love it!!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just the best tv show that ever was!! Its so sad it only lasted one seasion. A grate story . grate characters.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Like most I was disappointed that the first season was only 6 episodes, but this Special Edition is choked full of extras and goodies - much more special features than I anticipated.
B005CKPQ7A|1.0|Overrated. Overacted. What happened to stories where the good guy wins huh? No, instead we get this dribble. A dumb show full of many cliched and not well timed events
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|Love this classic fun movie. Gathering of famous detectives makes the evening interesting and very funny! Oh, and then there is the murder. Great fun
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele and was not disappointed with this CD. If you like Adele this CD is the one you will want to own. Glad I ordered it.
B0076I624W|5.0|Every time this movie comes on tv, I have to watch it.  So I just had to add it to my library.  In my opinion this is one of Brad Pitts best performances.  And then there is Anthony Hopkins!! Wonderful as usual!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really makes you have to think and remember things.  To me it is more stimulating than a regular game that you keep restarting when you fail,  In this game you keep working at it until you figure it out.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|This review is late but nonetheless, simply put this film is okay but not a enjoyable as the first. Mainly because is was somewhat anti-climatic for me.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Loved the book, loved the movie too (1950 film). Watched the movie as a kid which led me to reading the book. Still a great read.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is the second time I've seen this movie and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The mixture of action / adventure and comedy made for a pleasant evening!
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Woodstock was from my era and generation. I recall a lot of national news coverage - but this is the complete story, behind the scenes and lots of music as well. Music lovers - its a must .
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary is a lot more user friendly than the Kindle Oxford dictionary version.  it provide you with a drop down box of  words, as you type  in the search engine
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Despite the show being consummately British in the tradition of Upstairs Downstairs and Coronation Street, each episode of Downton Abbey is packed with quickly-paced storyline and engaging characters (even the characters that bore you will eventually turn your head towards interest...and even empathy and endearment; Edith Crawley, in particular).  The only quarrel I have with it is that the show must  accommodate for actors who can't seem to commit to a show for longer than 3 years (but perhaps that's just the way some British serial actors work [see the Doctor Who series for that]), which means re-writing storylines to kill off or otherwise remove our favorite characters (I won't spoil anyone).  I still love and greatly recommend this show to anyone who loves period pieces.
B008H6GH8I|3.0|Won't make you jump off of your seat in any way but weirdly better than the previous two live action Resident Evil films with Milla Jovovich. Like I said, It's just acceptable FILLER between games and RE6 did not meet my expectations. Actually now that I think about it, RE6 tries harder to be an action film than the two CGI films... and maybe even the live action films.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I. am so Happy its on Kindle now great fun for all ages. A must for grand parents.
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|Loved every season.... I miss this show.  You never know what was going to happen next.  If you liked SG1 you will like this
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you enjoy The Eagles or just a music lover in general then you must have this in your collection. Plug it in the dvd and enjoy all the history or just sit back and listen.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Great action without it being driven by an onslaught of graphics instead the visuals and effects play nicely in a well written and thoughtful SciFi movie.<br /><br />The best part though is that this movie is very low on material that is objectionable. How refreshing to be able to watch an exciting movie with the kids in the room.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I feel like this author is in my head, writing my thoughts, totally in a stream of consciousness way. Albeit much successfully than I seem to do when I try to put pen to paper. This is one of those life changing novels. It makes you think about how all the tiny little everyday decisions, no choices however insignificant, we make can irretrievably change our paths. Forever. Thank you to the author for the gift. I highly recommend you download and read it immediately.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Others have complained about the pace of the story in season 2, but I am satisfied. I'm only bummed that the special edition flip-out disc cases with special artwork were only included with the Limited Edition and not given as an option to purchase by themselves like the special edition for the first season. I didn't feel like paying $100+ for a big plastic zombie head that isn't very aesthetic for putting on display in the living room. Aside from the different artwork and less fancy case for the discs, the standard edition here comes with all of the same episodes and special features that you'd find on the discs in the limited edition.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have read all five of the series,it is a wonderful story ,the only complaint and it is a big one is why so many characters??It's like in the old days writing classical music or see how high you can build a tooth pick house by book five it had reached the point of foolishness.Was he trying to put every character he had ever though in one book .No wonder he says it was a double damn bitch.I'm sure there are people that can follow every twist and turn but for us average Joes it a bit much.<br />  But ,I'm still going to buy the next book in the hopes that you kill off at least 75 percent of the characters so we &#34;small folk&#34; can concentrate on the story ending.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Excellent game and free to would recommend<br />One of the best finding games I have played and I have brought a few
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks that catches one on the first few pages and you can't/won't want to put it down!!
B000MR1V22|5.0|I decided to add this DVD to my library.  I watched the movie when it first came out and loved it.  It is so funny and I laughed so hard my sides hurt.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I love the era and found to my surprise that Karen Black's performance was fascinating.  Mia Farrow was simpering, Bruce Dern is never a disappointment.  Karen and the music are worth the watch.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Makes all the the Marvel movies leading up to this look like filler and supplements intended to keep us content while we waited. I am enjoying the digital soundtrack that was included more than I thought I would. My favorite track is &#34;Comeback&#34; by Redlight King.
0345803485|2.0|and not a good role model for women - though it put women down, especially one so young, disgusted at the manipulation of the young woman - it may be okay for older women to &#34;get their rocks off&#34; but degrading to all women
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I like this game because its fun and I'm a pegasister. Good for any brony or pegasister, child or adult! I like this but its kinda sucky when it comes to beating the game... it'll take years to finish it unless you want to pay big bucks. Who would want to pay money for beating a game though? Not this pegasister!<br />  Chao! ;D
B002CMXAYW|5.0|This isn't as funny as the other Christopher Guest movies but I would recommend it for Guest fans. You won't be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app but I think they should add a few more functions but it is still a geart app keep up the reviews.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a fabulous movie. While not as memorable as the Pixar classics, it is a remarkable accomplishment nonetheless. The minions make the movie and are the funniest &#34;etc&#34; in the last four decades. I'm thinking the penquins from Mary Poppins give the minions a challenge (though I'll still take the minions).
B006WXHJNU|4.0|If the Hulk's (and Abomination's) animation and appearance was the of the same quality of the Hulk in the Avengers, this movie probably would have had much better reception. On the flipside, no more 3 mile leaps over a boring desert, bland storyline, and annoying multi-panel screens to keep reminding the viewers that the source material was a comic book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Addicted to this series.  Love the characters. Such great writing, and addresses all kinds of issues, politics, fashion, moral dilemas, and more.  Fascinating series, for sure!
B0041KXUGQ|5.0|Great movie....Everything was perfect shipping and handling, as indicated in the dicription, came with the wrapping still on it. Very happy customer
B00280LYIC|5.0|I LOVE GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND THIS BOOK PULLED ME I. IMMEDIATELY. I WISH I'D READ IT SOONER. PICK UP THIS BOOK AND BEGIN AN AMAZING ADVENTURE!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|So easy to use. Don't let the looks of it fool you though with all those pieces. After a few tries it will be like your a pro and a lot of it has to do with the shape of the bottle too. I'm very pleased and so glad my honey got this for me.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Loved the movie. Lots of action and kept my interest throughout the film. I don't know of anymore to say, then it was a great film. I recommend the film to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my house it's fun to play !!!!!!!!!! Love love love it that's it<br /><br />I love my horse its so much fun to play
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I heard Breezeblocks on the radio and had to get this CD. Some of the songs are a little slower than others. I think track 4 and 10 are my favorites for their beats. The singers voice is just so different and it was exactly what I was looking for. Still a great CD and I enjoy listening to the band!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The quality is perfect the audio incredible, the art book also is a very good plus, also the digital copy is very nice to have it.<br />100% recommended.
006056251X|5.0|Normally when I am not reading contemporary romance I choose historical western romances, like those written by Linda Lael Miller. But as I was reading through another review on Amazon about a book by Lisa Kleypas, a reviewer stated that one of her all time favorites was Devil in Winter, so I decided to read it and I loved it too!  Thanks Cheryl...<br /><br />Devil in Winter grabs you from the first page and won't let you go.  Evie Jenner is desperate.  Her father, owner of a prosperous gaming club in London, is dying and Evie's only wish is to see him before it's too late. Having been raised by her mother's family, they are determined to force her into a loveless marriage with a cousin she despises to keep the money she will inherit for themselves.  Her only hope is to find someone willing to marry her for her inheritance and protect her from her family. Viscount Sebastian St. Vincent is a rogue and a well known ladies man, handsome as the devil and used to a life of ease.  But the money is running out so when he is approached by a timid Evie with her request to marry, Sebastian knows a good thing when he sees it and readily agrees. Evie and Sebastian are comfortable with the agreement, knowing that it is a marriage of convenience that will suit both their needs.  They are both in for a surprise however as Evie realizes that he is not the callous lay about she thought he was, but a kind man with a very protective nature with a sensuous and sensitive side that takes her places she never dreamed she would go. Sebastian finds himself not with a timid little wallflower, but a beautiful intelligent woman who intrigues him like no other ever has. But there's more than one person determined to tear them apart and it will take a united front to keep them one step ahead of the danger.<br /><br />A fast paced, engaging historical romance with an incredibly appealing hero and a lovely heroine who deserves much more in life than she's been given so far.  Surely one of the bestfrom Lisa Kleypas and 5 stars for Devil in Winter.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Let me start out by saying I listen to and buy a LOT Of music. Probably about 20 CDs a year or more. This is my favorite CD at the moment. Every song on the CD is good, there are no bad songs. Granted I can see some of Patrick Stump's influence after Soul Punk on this CD, but for me that's a GOOD thing. While I've always liked Fall Out Boy's music, there was a 'sameness' about it up until this CD.<br /><br />I hadn't bought a Fall Out Boy CD before this since Infinity on High, but after listening to this CD I went back and bought [[ASIN:B002SBV0ZI Believers Never Die-the Greatest Hits]], and [[ASIN:B005JLN9Q2 Soul Punk]]. If you like catchy beats and more of a Pop feel, you're gonna love this CD.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I bought this film for my kids, after our trip to Disney World. They were intrigued by the charachters and had not seen all the movies. This was one of them. My children really enjoyed the movie and I caught myself watching it with them. Another Disney classic movie!!
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Entertaining rental, overall I liked it but glad I didn't pay to see in theater. i'm new to Amazon movies but I love that you can stream to your Blu Ray Player and Amazon has better prices than iTunes.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|with Daniel Craig and Eva Green it just doesn't get any better!  Recommend it to any one of any age - money well spent.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|I recently saw the movie &#34;Hannah Arendt&#34; and decided to read this book and the New<br />Yorker articles as background information. A wonderful decision. They both shed a great<br />enlightenment of Arendt's personality as well as the trial and its results. The book is one<br />of the best explanation of the Nazi philosophy and approach to the Jewish population.<br />In many cases a very depressing read but a valuable resource for understanding .
B008JEJNDE|5.0|Bought these as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. Not only are they cheaper than in store but with the croc name you know you're getting quality products. Would definitely buy more crocs from amazon in the future.
B000I9X53W|5.0|THis movie is one of the best of all time. The acting was superb by the entire cast, especially Dustin Hoffman. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Trantino, but this film was good. I have to say, without Jamie Foxx, this movie would have tanked hard. Jamie made this film what it was and he was awesome in the movie. I really think he was the shining force that led to the success of this movie. Like I said with Tarantino, I'm not a fan. But I loved this Film!!
B009IF82SK|5.0|At first I was skeptical but after giving the show a chance I'm glad I did.  Very funny and entertaining.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Good CD arrived in great shape.  Buble is the new Frank Sinatra, great on the radio and even better in concert.  This is great music for sexy time!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Such a magnificent story, with great acting and characters. I have rented this one twice, I need to just buy it. For a serious matter, they realy found the balance between getting the point across without making you feel awful. Love this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is a really cute idea but oh my this is very dangerous if you kids play on this app and you don't have parental control in place. The kids lost their life very quickly and the game kept asking them to pay for regenerate. Very disappointing and much too difficult for little ones.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I thought it was pretty true to the book. Matt played a great lead and the casting and portrayal of the main antagonist was almost exactly as I had imagined. Great movie.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|When this move was out, I did not get a chance to see in theaters. But I couldn't wait for it to come to Blu-Ray, since the previews gave me chill bumps. When watching the movie, there were some scary moments and I thought it was done well. Still not as scary as i had hoped, but it was a good story.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the characters and all their ups and downs! It's another entertaining and family friendly show! Can't wait to watch the next season!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I first saw this film when it first came out on tape - yes, tape. It is a hauntingly beautiful film and musical score. It is very much like watching an artful rendering of a documentary. It absolutely devastated me the first time that I saw it - and now, 30 years later, it still haunts me. How do we deal with our dichotomous nature? How can the precepts of Faith, Love, Forgiveness  survive in the face of aggression, hate, and domination? We are still dealing with those issues, are we not?
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I've never read the books, and had no expectations going into this movie. All in all, it was pretty good. I thought it was intriguing and entertaining. I'd watch it again.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|This is a really cute idea but it is very repetitive and limited. Even with the expansion app it was just the 4 characters and you had to do use every tool. There was no guess work or actual diagnosis. My 7 year old was bored with it after 20 mins. It was a waste of time and money for the expansion app.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|If you squint at these photos (after waiting at least an hour for them to &#34;develop&#34;), you can imagine an instagram-like effect. In reality, the color looks washed out and the result is highly dependent on the lighting--we never found what worked best.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Loved the idea of the movie and there was alot of action. But found myself getting bored with it, near the end of the film. But not to bad of an action sci-fi movie.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|A historical novel that taught me much about the French resistance fighters in World War II and their great bravery.  The story was riveting.  Ken Follet is a superb writer of historical fiction.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I recently purchased the movie; &#34;The Smurfs&#34;.  It was very well done and not only did I find it entertaining, but my grandchildren loved it.  They laughed and giggled all the way through it.  I highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it.
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|Horrible acting! Some parts were really laughable in this movie. I couldn't quite figure out if they meant it to be that way, or if it truely was that bad (hince the extra star). All in all, i would not recomend it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Skipped too many important connections between the characters. Developed some too much and others not enough. A disappointment after the &#34;Kite Runner.&#34;
1932100660|4.0|I can't really say how I like this book just yeat since I have not started reading it yet.  But what I can say is, many folks have recommended this book as a very good nutritional resource, which is why I went and bought it.  I'll update my review if I find anything different.
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|I liked the idea of the film. The movie started pretty strong. But near the end, it kind of tapered off. But still a good film, just not as scary as I had hoped it to be.
1938469011|3.0|Instead of being a &#34;Practical&#34; Guide I would call it a &#34;Pedantic&#34; Guide.  If you are a professional brewer of looking for a PhD research topic, this book might be for you.  If found it marginally useful for this home brewer.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver warns us and shows us how to avoid the Kahnemann traps and make intelligent forecasts where such are possible to make. If you enter competitive football pools, you should memorize this book. Also if you're into politics and world peace.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Love Hosseini's writing style.  This story weaved multiple stories over periods of time together, transporting me to different continents, cultures, eras.  I immediately went and reserved his other novel that I hadn't read yet.
B00CHILW64|5.0|saddest movie I have ever seen!  The acting was incredible...I don't think u could feel any closer to the real thing unless you were there yourself.
B003THJA1G|5.0|Love this series.  Season 1 isn't as good as some of the later seasons but it's a good start to a great series!
B008220D7S|3.0|This move was alright, it had its moments. But overall, do not watch to laugh through the whole thing. They tried to add some drama to complete the story. But there are some funny parts to the film. Its a good movie for the right price!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Of course wish it were longer cuz it's a great app, but looking forward to the next one. I hope the next one is out soon.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I have read all the Hobbit books and watched the movies.  I enjoyed watching this one too.  I could watch it several times.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This should be required reading about the realities in North Korea.  Well written and startlingly painful to digest, my book club had some great deep discussion about this impactful book.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|This is about a teenager who is part of a tribe called the Ahwahneechees, which means people of the Ahwahnee (Yosemite Valley) Her name is Oria. She is going to a family reunion with her grandmother to celebrate their heritage in Yosemite National Park. People have disappeared mysteriously. Rumor has it, they have turned into shapshifters. This hooked me right in! I had to know what was going on!<br /><br />I loved how her grandmother kept calling her `my little golden queen'. And I wondered if there was hidden meaning. Another thing I love is romance. So one of my favorite parts was when Oria met the handsome Grey Wolf. He delivers the news that she is in a `different' camp. She's not very happy with him and I loved the dialogue between them. She starts to learn that she is different with a power she can't explain.<br /><br />The author does a fantastic job with all her world building and the kingdom. I felt like I was actually there. I'm a fantasy reader so this book was perfect for me!!!! All kinds of turns and twists happen, when evil invades, and I don't want to give too much away. But this story is chock full of shape shifters and fairies and Indian lore and magic. This is a read you don't want to miss! I loved it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Whoever made this app is a genius.  Great for meditation and for listening to while going to sleep.  Also for soothing background sounds.  Different sounds which you can mix together with ability to adjust volume for each sound.  Love the chimes and crickets and<br />rain together.  Puts me in a different magical place.  Love it!
030789701X|4.0|They did a good job with this book. It should last a long time. So far I have found no mistakes in the book. The hard cover will out last any of the paper bound books I bought earlier. My main problem is the Small text used when the book was published. I know that if they had printed it in a larger text; It might be twice the size that it is. Which means I have to get out magnifying glasses to read it. I live on a small fixed income. So if I can save a few dollars via Amazon thats OK with me. I think their prices are closer to the real cost of books today.
B008EKMB82|4.0|I like the story.  Interesting, but sometimes difficult to follow.  Need to reference to translate Japanese words often.  There are not many Asian-American authors, so I enjoy reading what is available.  Haven't been able to finish the book yet (I am easily distracted), but look forward to it's conclusion.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Well done DDL.  You deserve that Oscar.  After we get past the first 5 minutes of the train station act, the movie and acting do a great job of taking us back to that time.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Sweet tale, reminds me of an English Walton's mountain. Introspective look at a small English shire at the turn of the century
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Oria is back once again and is the Golden Queen. Along with elders, friends, she goes on another mission to help free lost spirits. The discovery of drawings leads to the past. But this mission is not easy as they fight against Ala, an evil spirit, and there is a big battle. I loved learning about the native culture as the story is unfolded. One of my favorite characters is Oria's grandma. I think the author did an excellent job with her. She is so wise and knows so much. I love hearing her give wisdom. She really adds something special to this book and I just had to note that. I loved the shapeshifters too. They were cool! This is a story of magic and good versus evil. I loved it!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Daft Punk fans will not be disappointed. They have done it again with Get Lucky. The beat is great and the electronica is classic.
0385523394|5.0|A lot different from the show.<br />It is Still a Great story.<br />If you love the show you'll love the book!
B000022TSF|5.0|a different better time in LA... when white angelinos talked to each other and could walk the streets without being mugged..clothing and the cars were much higher quality and prices were reasonable...a higher civilization
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I thought it was a decent read. Probably not my type of story but it was ok. I doubt if I would read any other follow up Silo stories.
B009LDD54K|5.0|A great period piece about a time that I first heard about at my father's knee.  A fine cast of very fine actors well cast.  Steve Buscemi is the star and the reason I watch.  He has the ability to make you root for him even though he is an evil bastard.  When I first went to Atlantic City in the 70s it was still controlled by gangsters and I think I saw Nucky's spirit at the Sands.  This show is a history lesson made appealing.
B004TLM284|5.0|I work out to this album all the time, it is upbeat and makes you feel confident. I try to listen to it as often as I can :)

B004LWZWBU|3.0|With this cast and the subject matter, I expected more.  Not sorry I saw it, but I won't bother to show it to friends.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Fun, different than AB. Entertaining to play before bed. The play is different than AB and that makes it enjoyable.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|...hilarity and tragedy are usually hard to blend together so well, but he makes it look easy.  A must-see film.
B00CBKVGGY|4.0|The movie was suspensful and it was also full of action.  Different but good.  Had to see how it ended.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Great collection of rocking Zeppelin songs for a great price. The CD version was less expensive then the MP3 album. Glad to have a physical copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun game that unlike other free games actually is free. I've never felt like we needed to pay to advance.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Nothing beats classic Star Trek!  I just wish that Amazon would stream to more blue ray players.  Get with the game Amazon!  I am not upgrading my system again till something breaks.  Netflix seems to work well....  fix this and I will give Amazon 5 stars!
B001AI7KAE|5.0|Lots of great songs.  The lyrics are clear.  I love the music.  The best hits of La Oreja De Van Gogh.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Don't take everything so seriously... this may not be historically true, but it's an interesting theory, and certainly a delightful bit of fiction.  Lovely to watch, excellent drama, fine acting.  Loved it.  :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks. This was a very nice &#34;beach book&#34; or &#34;travel book&#34;, perfect for a summer read. It is a nice story with a few obstacles that work out in the end. There was nothing to get stressed about, just a good story from start to finish.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far, clean master has cleaned 320 G of my kindles memory which is awesome. Very helpful. I recommend this app to anyone who has a slow device.
B001EC3JME|2.0|I am pained to write a critical revue of something so well constructed for its asking price, but buyers should be aware of two important functional shortcomings (fixable in a re-design):<br /><br />1.  The belt clip is so over-designed for retention that it is almost impossible to use except as a thread-it-on-and-thread- it-off-the-belt.  I am disgusted with the effort required to snap it on or off a belt.  It is over kill.  Start over with the design.<br /><br />2.  The swivel that allows the unit to be carried at different angles is under-designed, in that it allows the unit to flop over to bad angles in use.  I attended a concert last weekend (Frankie Valli - fantastic!) and the unit rotated on its own to where my $80 flashlght could have fallen out and been lost in the crowd headed to the parking lot.  Only the fine construction of the unit body retained the flashlight.  The rotating clip MUST have tighter detents or a locking clasp to hold the angle the user has selected.<br /><br />This is a good effort by this company, worth twice the asking price, except for the above critical defects.  I hope they will upgrade the design.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|My girlfriend and I recently watched all the Ice Age movies on Amazon Prime streaming.<br /><br />Very entertaining great story lines with well known celebrities providing the animated character voices.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I saw this movie years ago but the books are always better!!  They bring you into the feelings, thoughts and senses of the characters much more vividly than any actor can.  I was born and raised in the North, where we didn't \\"grow up\\" w/segregation in the 70's, 80's n 90's; Thank you Lord!! I've to say, I'd have HATED IT!  I wasn't raised to simply dislike a person b/c of skin color, I was raised to treat people the way I wished to be treated.  To let the person's character INSIDE determine whether I liked them or not.  There MIGHT be \\"branches of the KKK\\" in the North but as far as we knew, they were only a \\"myth from history\\".  I wouldn't have been very popular, as I have a # of African American FRIENDS!  After living in the South for a # of years, I can say, w/out hesitancy that I trust them more than the white \\"friends\\" I have.  They don't turn around n TELL everyone what I JUST told them in confidence; they've only 1 face!<br />As for the book, I believe I've read much more controversial novels.  I found the beginning absolutely repulsive, being a female.  I have sons but I'm a PARENT nonetheless n this book really hit home.  I read it also b/c Mr. Grisham has written a SEQUEL to this<br /> book, due out in October 2013!  I'm SO VERY excited to read
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Don't listen to the nit-pickers and whiners.  This movie was a brilliant idea and beautifully done.  It's a nice change to watch a movie that really gives you something to think about afterwards.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Sort of cute, but can you force your hippie eco agenda down my throat a little harder?  Birkenstocks required wearing while watching
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Love this game, best game I've ever played.  It has me using my brain. Definitely gets a 5 star from me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book. It keeps you interested all the way through it. I usually don't read these kind of books, but it was worth the money.
B002ZG97EC|2.0|Ok, notice this item says it s a blu-ray-DVD+digital download! It IS NOT A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD OF THE MOVIE! Feel duped! Love this movie, wanted on my ipad....this product does not allow for that! Disappointed!
0062231375|5.0|This is a funny and scary look at the restaurant biz in all it's craziness.  A really good and easy read that tells the story of life in the kitchen and beyond.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lavish and beautiful to look at, Downtown Abbey's third season returns with the same level of drama viewers have come to expect of the Crawleys and their servants.  One of Downtown's most winning traits is how well they develop their characters and season three continues this tradition, with special focus on the characters of Tom Branson, Lady Sybil's chauffeur-turned-husband, and problems faced by Thomas, the ever wily footman.  There are fun new faces, such as Shirley McClaine, and the return of a few old ones as well.<br /><br />There are a few stumbling blocks; romantic rivalries between house servants feels very soapy, as does the plot line surrounding the financial future of Downtown.  But overall it's the same winning period piece fans have come to love, with some lovely moments and some heartbreaking twists before all is said and done.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Wasn't able to finish it, then life caught up with me like it sometimes does, and couldn't finish it in the 24 hour time slot.  That 24 hour rental thing is sort of ridiculous isn't it?  I pay for the rental, doesn't harm amazon at all if I watch it over the course of a week or so right?  Like a throwback to the old video rental agreements.  Except others can rent it all they want if I take longer to watch it.  Failure to adapt to new technology is why no one feels sorry for music and movie companies that try to bully consumers with their copyrights that make no sense in the scheme of things anymore.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|I'm sure that it is difficult to compress several volumes of a very complicated story into a few hours.  However, the writers of these episodes concentrated way too much on the battles the special effects that were supposed to represent magic and the torture of scantily clad women. The novels were intriguing causing the reader to wait with anticipation for the next.  Not having a third season of this attempt will not be missed
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love this game. My grandsons have this on their kindle and they hooked me. Its challenging and fun to play.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a better zoo game than some that my daughter has played. It's 3D and she likes that you get to rescue the animals. Fun to play.:-D♥
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a good book.  I can't say that it blew me away, because it was a story that needed to tie up a lot of loose ends.  It still was a fun read and entertaining like the rest of the series :)
B0012QRPU4|5.0|You should see this show! It is one of a kind! Makes you wonder realy, ppl would do that for money! but stil a nice show great story line!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|but why take a great actor like Joseph Gordon Leavitt and stick a fake nose on him just to make him look like old man Bruce?  You do know actors need their faces to emote?  And sci fi audiences will suspend disbelief about stuff like that right?  Overall really good though.
0811874192|5.0|How I enjoy creativity and this book certainly shows it!<br />The book has become my centerpiece 'floral arrangement' on my dining table when company comes.<br />Oh, the page turning 'ahs' and 'this is so clever' and 'this is my favorite bouquet.'<br />Fun conversation piece/book.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I did not care for this game. It takes your money way too fast. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very entertaining series.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would compare it to the Inspector Morse series.  It is a type of entertainment that would appeal to many people.  I like that it has no vulgar words in it and the actors and actresses are of a higher caliber
0698115635|5.0|My son loves Eric Carle, when I saw this book I was not familiar with it. Upon purchasing it I'm very pleased, my son gets Tuesday and Thursday mixed up so this helps. There's even a song at the end of the book, that goes with the text very fun!!
B00005R62N|4.0|I am not even a fan o this band, but, damn it, they know how to make a live record. The effect of guitars blended with knife cutting vocals are the key to amazement, Sinner and Victim of changes being the high peaks. Good songs and one doesn´t need to be a banger to like them. Rock climaxes along the way shine the hearing, it is not epic metal, it is just rock n roll with passion.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|More like a boring treatise on aging.  Production meeting:  We have one of the best Bond's since Connery, and we made one of the best Bond's with him in Casino Royale.  Let's get Javier Bardem, one of the better actors working today.  Awesome, now let's make Bardem a farcicle, poorly fleshed out villain with nothing but uncomfortable gay moments to work with and basically remake Home Alone while we wax nostalgic at every chance we get.  Skip it.
B001L1S1SK|4.0|The product is in excellent condition! Brand new and still in the original packaging! So, no scratched discs! It was a great buy. 6 discs for 13 bucks! The only thing I wasn't too fond of was how long it took to get to me. I took almost three weeks to reach my house :P
B00632HWOG|5.0|yahoo mail is very good. it makes It very easy to access my account. Thank you. I would highly recommend this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We are waiting for season 4. The continuing saga has go my wife and I hooked. The streaming was a little rough. It may have been due to our HDMI cable to our TV. I believe this series gives a good look into English culture in the 1920's.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens in the next book! I am so happy Ava and GIdeon are figuring out. Hopefully her parents can too.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We watched it with my husband and loved it!quite intriguing plot plus nice work of actors. Looking forward to the season 3
0440241901|4.0|This book is one of the most wonderful books and it is fun and fast paced book to read. Definitely enjoyed it.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|thanks im having alot of fun.im my moms sum u will defintly be seeing more orders from me i love super man or the actoin figure i love stuff like this thz so much
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|At the beginning of the book it was pretty boring. Until the middle of the book is where it got interesting. I wanted to see Katniss more with Petta and unfortunately didn't see it. I was upset at the ending just because it ended a little too weird and after all the bad that happened I felt like they couldn't recover any happiness in the book. I recommend this book if you want to finish the trilogy but I am still sadden.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|After being led to this book by Vinnie Tortorich and his book, &#34;Fitness Confidential,&#34; I'm amazed that I have been getting the wrong advice for decades. This really clears up the science behind why reducing carbohydrates, and eliminating sugar and grains, is the way to stay healthy.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|This is perfect, no need to convert my boss portable speaker dock from 30pin to lightening pin,<br />using this allows me to play my music via bluetooth from my ipod 7th generation or ipad etc.<br />Beautiful
B004UID2LC|5.0|its awesome i never found a good youtube downloader app i tried this one and it works fanstastic!! i do reccomend it
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Good book . Recommends<br /><br />Is a good start for those introverted people. Basics for communication purposes. Recent as a starting.tool.for every day interaction
B005HEPN06|5.0|The Next Generation keeps improving year after year.  We started watching season one and two, a few episodes each, and did not care for them very much.  So far, however, we like Star Trek Enterprise, and Deep Space 9 the best.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This makes me think of COD WaW there's no bad thing to say about this app.it's like having a real gun in your hand.
0307277453|5.0|as a religious very fanatical fundamentalist bible creationist, being brought up that the world is literally 6000 years old, i knew evolution was right but couldn't agree to actually accept it. Neil Shubin with the love of a teacher, the enthusiasm of an explorer, and smartness of a scientist, took me by his wings and made me fly into this new world seeing with my own eyes how evolution is true and is fact. A truly joyful read!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I wanted a budget gaming rig. I bought this processor and it works like a charm. With my EVGA GTX 650 2gb Video card and 8gb of 1600mhz ram any game is playable. Every game i play i can use ultra or very high settings. I would pick this over a i5. Just because of the great price
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a ferry fun app for kids and dads you can upgrade your player and get cool power ups
B005KLZWZC|5.0|My son is a HUGE Percy Jackson fan and he found the set to be amazing. It came in a cute little book box to hold the set! I highly recommend this set for younger readers who are not quite ready for hardback books!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I saw the good reviews for this game on both Amazon and Google and decided to give it a try. I am very impressed! It is not only gorgeous to look at but more importantly the game play is designed perfectly--challenging but just easy enough to still be fun.  It runs smoothly on my S3. Give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family loves this game. Me and my eighteen year old battle back and forth for hours it's great.
B000VKHW9Q|5.0|I'm a truck driver and hated the wire seals, I was at a receiver they had this I thought it would never work but much to my surprise it cut it like butter so I ordered on of my own its a must for those cold days when you want cut it fast and get warm again great tool
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am really enjoying this game so far. it is a different take on their hidden object games for sure, it, is really cool.
B00338QENI|2.0|Great book very informative. Never got bored, I always want to keep reading. There were times I got emotional and sad. This is a masterpiece I am thinking about buying a hard copy.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It's a fairy tale w a Hollywood take, so what ya gonna do?! Visually stunning, but otherwise lacking in most other categories. Definitely entertaining to a child though... I would think
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Primitive and inaccurate. Set to my location where it is raining with thunderstorm warning in effect and weather app said partly cloudy and zero precipitation.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I love to scuba dive and snorkel and this housing was just what i needed to take my underwater photography to new levels. I did have some water get into the forward lens compartment, but a little toilet tissue stuffed inside with a wick took care of that problem nicely.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I downloaded the game as a Free App of the Day, and enjoyed playing it. The game is simple and involves two &quot;buttons&quot;, one for blocking and one for punching. You can change the color and design of the shorts, gloves, hat and sun glasses. The monkeys stats increase over time, which might help in a two player match.<br /><br />The game gets old relatively quick, as there isn't much variation or variety in the game play, but I think it would be worth ONE dollar, not the three it normally sells for. There are way too many better games out there, don't waste $3 on this one (but definitely download it free today).
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Loved Season 2, can't wait for Season 3 so I started reading the book.  Love the book just as much.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book had me in tears. I really felt as if I was feeling their pain with them. I definitely recommend.
B000003CM8|5.0|see ;my review of idlewild south. they are the same: timeless and timely; engaging and fun. A must own album
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Different from others. A little too familiar between songs. Best when mixed in with other artists. I prefer a blend most times anyway.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I read the reviews on Amazon before I ordered the product. I was not disappointed. Conveniently designed. I have not tried a second device with it.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This movie which was directed by Robert Redford was fantastic.  I have read a lot of books on Lincoln, the Civil War, John Wilkes Boothe and all that so I had the background of information already before seeing this movie the only thing is people that did not have the background in Mary Surrat's life might would have liked to have more of that expounded on in this movie.  But to me this movie was GREAT.
B001974DG0|5.0|I loved this book. Hard to put down.  I think this was my favorite Dean Koontz book so far.  Loved the dog!
1401938906|5.0|Thank you Pam for this wonderful book. Just what I needed. I do believe in the saying &#34;when the student is ready the teacher appears&#34;. I see this more and more as I move through life. The lessons appear just when I'm ready to learn more.
B000003CM9|5.0|This and the first album, below, are classics and timeless. The music has held up for 40 years. A band just beginning its ascent.
B007L7JY3Y|4.0|I own this program on my iTouch and enjoy using it there. Program syncs with Toodledoo web account with no major problems. This allows me to keep my ToDo list up to date at all times. Would have given it 5 stars if it also linked with the notes section of Toodledo which it does on my iTouch. Hopefully, they will update the program to access the notes section of Toodledo.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|This truly was a very interesting and compelling movie.  I truly enjoyed the aspects of this movie and what it all concerned.  Would recommend to anyone for watching.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Perfect for running - lightweight, stay put, short cord. I don't like earbuds, and this style is hard to find these days.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I love magic I bought the demo was going to buy full version but I am some how cursed with the game constantly downloading and installing its self I already have it but it has a mind of its own
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This was an endearing movie.  The music was fabulous and did not seem forced into the plot. I was disappointed that they did not show the quartet singing at the end.
B008JEJNA2|5.0|croc's are wonderful shoes for me.  my wide feet feel super when I wear these -- which is all the time!  I love the choice of colors and the contrasting soles.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Me and my family all enjoyed and loved this movie a lot. I particularly liked the character of Q, which was portrayed by Ben Whishaw. And the price was decent as well, so overall, it was very satisfying purchase.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|another dime wasted on another misleading product...tried every movement setting change option in the book online or anywhere Kinect sensor wouldn't  see anything or anybody with this thing on it
B009WUAK2M|2.0|SO there they are, all the heroes of my youth, Rambo, the Terminator and all the others who seem to &#34;die hard.&#34; Although it is fun to see them all together, the plot is thin and a poor excuse for pyro-technics. I would not recommend this to my friends
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a clear portrait of the man and the surrounding cast that has so profoundly shaped how we live our lives today, form our governments and organize our beliefs.
0545123275|3.0|I first discovered this author after reading Scorpio Races, which I loved.  I then just finished reading Raven Boys, which I also though was a great read. So I decided to read some of her back catalogue since I have to wait until September to read the second Raven Boys book.  I was encouraged by the good reviews for Shiver and decided to give it a try.  Well all I can say is that its a far inferior book to either Scorpio Races or Raven Boys.  You can catch glimpses of the writer's great knack for lanquage in this book but that is it. Only glimpses.  I think the problem is that this story is written from first person perspective and the characters are so ewy gooey, that I just can't take the story or their suffering seriously.  Grace is pretty much in the vain of the female characters that I loved in SR and RB but Sam...I can barely tolerate Sam.  I think at one point he describes himself as dangerously Emo...never have truer words been written on a page.  I kept wanting Sam to man up and grow a pair!  I do understand that this story was written during the height of the Twilight craze so many authors were trying to imitate the feel of those novels, but if you are coming from Maggie's more recent work, this book is simply not good at all.  Not horrible but far from good.<br /><br />But what this book shows is how much the author has improved as a writer.  She is almost a different writer entirely.  I have to give her kudos for that.  I can't wait to read what she puts out in the future.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I gave this a five star it's however somewhat repetitive. But with their new star girl game editions coming out does push it to a five star. You get tons of clothing,hair,make-up, and other accessories to choose from. Facebook website has tons of people leaving their characters game tag so you can add friends. The more friends you have the more game daily gems(gems-used for premium items) or coins you get. Also really love the fact you can earn these gems somewhat easily throughout the game..or you can purchase them. Either way I recommend playing..if you like girly games with lots of bling!!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Looking back at this show, it's definitely dated. On the other hand, Richard Dean Anderson is a pretty likeable guy in just about every series he does. This series is pretty much the predecessor to TV shows demonstrating that a paperclip and chewing-gum can get a person out of a jam.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Still need to figure out how to use it.  Probably should not be rating it yet because of that reason.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|Mash one button to punch and one to block. Spin a disc to knock out. Are you serious? I can't believe anyone has had to pay for this. As a free app of the day I still deleted it. Gave it to my 6 year old who lost interest after 2 minutes. I will give the graphics some kudos. This is a boring and repetitive as it gets.<br /><br />P.S. This is hands down the most boring game I have ever seen that has soooo many 5 star ratings. While I think some of those may actually believe this game deserves this, I find it incredulous that all of them are genuine. There are ads hiring people to rate their games highly. its out there. And suspect this has happened. I have no proof of this and in no way have any grounds to accuse any one of this. Nor have I. If this game floats your boat, enjoy. If my review displeases you, well I guess you can take time out of your day to bash me personally. I read reviews and post the occasional one, but don't find it neccessary to bash the reviews I disagree with.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|We all dream of a perfect world but could there be consequences to that world?  This story makes the reader think.
4898153194|5.0|I loved the book, and it arrived in excellent condition, which is especially important since it's an art book. I may get more as gifts.
B004RL9T50|3.0|This movie was not as funny as we had hoped the main funny part was &#34;ow! my big blue head!&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Doesn't work with the latest firmware for the first generation AirPort Extreme.  Need to go back to an earlier version
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Not only do I enjoy the game but I can bring along while I travel and my kids can enjoy it too.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love it!! Can print from my kindle fire and my iPhone!! Easy!!!! All I have to do is click on something and it wirelessly sends to my printer ;)
111846446X|4.0|Well thought out book. I liked the file explainations and the references it provided.and the examples it gave.. Very useful.
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|This is the movie to sit down and watch anytime. It's a great storyline and great effects. Awesome characters.<br />Anytime movie.
B002KKCVWI|4.0|Arrived quick. They feel like they could span three sizes- one up and one down. But that doesn't take away from their comfortable fit. No complaints!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I LOVE this show!  I can't believe I missed it when it was on.  I wish they would bring it back on tv.  There are only two other sci-fi shows, in my opinion, that come before fringe and they are SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis.  Anyway, this is a great series and I felt bad when I finished watching the first four seasons.  I wished there were another ten plus more seasons of watch!  I would give this 20 stars if I could.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very interesting story and well written. Have read his other books and felt this one was his best so far.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|A very profound book that felt like the sum of the parts were better than the whole. Neil Gaiman is a brilliant author, observer and philosopher. Here he has articulated concepts and ideas in an incredibly eloquent, elegant and just downright smart and creative way. Way better than I ever could, even within my own mind. But ultimately, I wasn't as affected by the book as it felt like I should have been. I was never captivated or swept up completely into the story. It really is an intelligent book that for me fell short of amazing.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I will have my grandchildren that will be visiting this week show me how to play this and I may revise my opinion.
B00973902K|5.0|This is one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance!  Love it.  Love being able to download it instantly.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|The volume is too soft. Some keys have no sound. You can't play two notes at the same time. Needs a lot of improvement.
B00004X10B|5.0|I've crammed this thing with nearly all my gear except for lighting grip stuff and I think I still have room for a 55-300.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Great app, lots of fun, had it for a while now and still load it daily.fun fun fun fun fun
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nicely done, lots of things to do. Well thought out with just the right balance of puzzles. I liked it!<br />Please create more of this type.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I ordered it without even had seen the movie. It had been highly recommended by a friend who said she knew I'd like it, and I did.<br />I've sung in choirs throughout my life, and music is an important aspect of my life, so it greatly appealed to me.  I've shared it with other musical friends. Love that the older musicians appeared in it. What a delightful, feel good movie!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Before using this app I was wondering why I couldn't view the videos. I already downloaded a video viewer but it won't work. With this, watching videos is no problem.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|I hated the ending for two reasons: It was a crappy ending and I didn't really want the book to end. The numerous stories within the story were much more interesting than the overall story (if there was one at all). The Kindle edition is perfect for this book with its thousands of footnotes, since the hyperlinks take you straight to the footnotes, which link back to the text (although some of the three-page footnotes inside the 15-page footnotes got to be very confusing--but would have been even worse in print, I think).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have to agree with other reviewers that the ending is predictable, but that said, the author handles a delicate subject in a humorous and thoughtful manner.  It is a book that will keep you thinking long after you finish reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game ever don't get the other games that r like this because those ones r ripoffs $7 is.worth the game
B00COCY67A|5.0|What attractive packaging!  Very uniquely and creatively done. I'm really enjoying this release.  I bought one for my friend who visits me from Stockholm Sweden every year. SInce we're both avid Elvis fans, we will be singing along with it on our day outings. There's a picture in the booklet taken in Milwaukee; I was at that concert at the Arena. I remember how impressive he looked in his blue outfit with cape. I cherish the fact that I saw him in person. I'm so glad to have ordered it. And it's a good buy with so many songs on each CD.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Don't always agree with Aslan but it was an engaging read and cast the whole James v. Paul discussion in a new light for me.  Read it in one day - so it was engaging and accessible.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Except for the one about the lawyer sick of his job who leaves work, family, and Mississippi for life on a beach, which I think I've read in about half of Grisham's books, I loved all of the stories here. The one about the nursing home was excellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|OK - everyone is bored after years of playing Solitaire on MS Windows.  I was.  My wife found this app first and was telling me how great it was.  Really ?  she was right.  Don't start unless you have time to waste.  I'll start and say to myself &#34;I'm only going to play three games and then put it down&#34;.  Good luck with that strategy.  The game has built-in statistics which will shame you into playing more games.  Not your old MS Windows Solitaire.  You've been warned.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Really enjoyed this app. Would like to see more \\"floors\\" though. I found<br />it very entertaining. A leisurely brain game.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It's simple<br />Functional<br />Nice to look at<br />Would recommend<br />I don't like that there are no different backgrounds. Over all like
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good story and excellent special effects!  It was an original idea which is lacking in the current trough of movies with recycled ideas or characters.
6305736650|5.0|Are you kidding!  Probably the best movie ever mad.  Everything needed in a movie, intrigue, suspense, love, sex, bribery, all sorts interesting pieces.
B004T340QY|5.0|If you like comedies, if you like movies set in the old south or just depression era, if you appreciate the comedy in idiots thinking they are highly intelligent, you are sure to like this one.  If you know something about US history (blues music, political names / tactics, gangsters, etc.) you will even more so appreciate the parody of historical figures in the movie (names have been changed to protect the guilty!  lol  Or in one case the state he governed was changed but his name was not)  Oh, and if you like scenes of machine gunning livestock, this movie is for you! :-)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|World at Arms is a very addictive game and is perfect for strategists or people who love a good challenge. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because energy is a bit hard to come by. It would be nice if the energy plants actually produced energy instead of just a certain amount given post-construction. Please let plant produce energy in the following updates!

0143117009|4.0|The author, a professor of geography and an environmentalist, has written a lengthy book that is a wakeup call whereby he clearly demonstrates that the sustainability of life on this planet as we know it is in some jeopardy. The depletion of natural resources; the damage and pollution to our lands, waters, and air; and climatic changes combined with an exploding global population, if not significantly addressed, could have unpleasant, even devastating, consequences in only a matter of decades.<br /><br />In addition to looking at the early 2000's environmental and political situations in Rwanda, Haiti, Australia, China, and the state of Montana, he drives home his point by examining several ancient societies that literally collapsed due to environmental failure, namely, the Eastern Islands, the Anasazi of the Southwestern US, the Mayans of the Yucatan, and the Norse of Greenland, among others.<br /><br />The relevance of the demise of those societies hundreds of years ago may be questioned. They were highly isolated, if not totally, and obviously had no scientific understanding of their environments. All lived in difficult climatic conditions that could not support their populations. Deforestation, soil erosion, and the elimination of edible species presaged their end. Clearly, the elites of those societies mismanaged resources to enhance their standing, but did they really have the capacity and information to choose to take their societies in different directions and not succumb to their harsh environments?<br /><br />Inhospitable environments are no stranger to the 21st century, and if the vast amount of scientific and ecological information does not filter into a society, they can find themselves facing the same sort of starvation and man-versus-man confrontations of those older societies. Several areas of Africa are prime examples, and Haiti is not far behind. The author repeatedly makes the point that we live in a globalized, integrated world. The effects of population growth, environmental degradation, resource depletion, and climatic changes cannot be confined to isolated areas such as the Easter Islands.<br /><br />In the 21st century, it is global corporations that have worldwide impacts. While not all of the earth's problems can be laid at the feet of global corporations, the author shows that the oil, mining, timber, and fishing industries have had deleterious impacts on the environment. The author is cautiously optimistic that the public will be able to sufficiently pressure corporations and governments to be far more pro-environment. Some initiatives are underway in some industries with modest successes.<br /><br />While COLLAPSE is an important book and at times interesting, it is long, slow-going, and repetitious. Regarding his optimism, the author really does not demonstrate that there are effective environmental political movements that have substantial influence in the political process. Is choice more a chimera than not? Furthermore, he assumes that the world's main problems are environmental. Where would he put the huge worldwide divides concerning religion and haves vs. have-nots and the possibilities of nuclear war?<br /><br />The author tells of his students wondering how it is that someone could cut down the last tree on Easter Island, but one might equally wonder in our democratic era how it is that we have allowed huge private entities to have so much power over our lives and permitted such a mal-distribution of resources and earnings. So who are the stupid and irresponsible: the ignorant people of the Eastern Islands or modern societies with the benefits of science, information, and the study of the past?pulation growth, environmental degradation, resource depletion, and climatic changes cannot be confined to isolated areas such as the Easter Islands.<br /><br />In the 21st century, it is global corporations that have worldwide impacts.

141690977X|4.0|Had to read to see what the hoopla was about and it is pretty good but just sick of all the book asking women to make adjustments
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I am a late 80's kid and now a 20-something - I am hooked on watching this series! Its so sad and funny@the same time. The DVD's were in great condition and the show was great - if you like mild suspense and drama and pretty decent one-liners check it out.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This knife sharpening tool does a good job for what it was designed for but, it is a little to small for me to get a good grip on it. If it were just about another inch longer it would be a 5 star rating.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|Is Hugh Laurie a better actor than a singer? Yes, certainly, but he is an EXCEPTIONAL actor and it would be hard to top that talent alone.With that being said, I found that he truly poured his heart into the making of this CD and that he also felt the music he performed and that is all that I ever expect from any artist. He was believable and I truly enjoyed the music and look forward to his concert on November 1st here in Durham, NC.  I will be on the second row and look forward to hearing him perform live, these very songs.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My kids love this game and with it being educational it is a 5 star rating all around. Love this game to play !
B005V2S7FW|2.0|I don't understand why they think we will pay a monthly subscription fee for a password management app? If 1 time fee, I'd buy it no problem.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|The book is quick, fast-paced, overview of HTML5 and JS, and does a nice job of touching the high points.  Don't expect the book to drill-down to the details.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is a little difficult to &quot;buy&quot; enough stuff at times to fill the park because a lot of missions are to expand the park and dinosaurs get pretty pricy pretty quick. Over all its a fun game and I'm really glad I found it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Luv the game.I didn't expect it to be this good to play this game. Keep updates the good work. I've already been asking my family n friends to play it too.
0425252868|5.0|I am a big WW2  student.<br />this is a great great read ---truly proving [again] that real life beats fiction.<br />Memphis Belle was a great movie but this one would be better--if Spielberg doesnt do it someone will
0740797719|1.0|Very technical and not helpful. Talks a lot about camera settings. Almost every painting has a dinosaur in it. What's up with that?
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I really like this cable. It has a much thinner molded end than most on the market. It is also a higher quality cable than most. It has a nice matte finish, and feels well made. Some cables like this have very thick molded ends that can be a problem when trying to plug into ports that have a case around them, or that are tight access for some other reason. I have never had that problem with these cables. I believe they are a bit pricey for what you are getting, but that is to be expected with most of Amazon's accessories. Watch for a sale or a coupon, and grab several then. Amazon has a lot of promos and coupons, so watch for them, and take advantage of their kindness.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|My school decided to read this book for a summer reading.  Will be discussing it this coming school year 2013-2014.
1476733953|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet -<br /><br />I hated the first 30 pages of this book.  It was a little verbose, the picture was unclear and it almost made me put the book down and away on the shelf.  But I HAD to continue because I run a book club and cannot NOT read the story.<br /><br />I'm SO thrilled I continued.  The story was excellent - gripping - and I found myself on the edge of my seat more often than not.  The story is believable, the characters aren't too exaggerated yet they are complex and dynamic and I just continued reading at every chance I had.<br /><br />I give this a 5 out of 5 stars.  An A+ despite the beginning which turned me off.  This book is worth the read and worth every penny.<br /><br />Great story!
B008EZVNFE|4.0|Beautiful voice; love most of the songs on this CD.  Can't categorize the music...all the cuts are different.  Most very smooth and sultry sounding.  I like it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game with many different games in one.  It will keep you busy and thinking and fun at the same time.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It was a good movie, but seemed to drag on. It was a bit depressing and unrealistic.  I wouldn't recommend to friends.
072325804X|5.0|This book collection is great! The stories are funny, cute, and adventurous, and often have moral lessons. The language throughout the books is beautiful. I'd much rather my daughter grow up reading books with this vocabulary than many of the books nowadays that have a very limited vocabulary. My husband and I read this to my daughter as a family, because it has stories we all enjoy. I truly love The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin. When I first read it, I was laughing so hard throughout that I had to pause my reading many times; the humor brought tears to my eyes. When my sister came to visit, I had her read it knowing she already hates squirrels, and she thought it was very funny too. The illustrations in this book are beautiful and so detailed. You can tell by the way the animals behave and look that Beatrix Potter truly understood them. It's my favorite book out of over 100 books on my 12 month old daughter's bookshelf.
034580709X|5.0|All the Harry Hole novels have been great. Jo Nesbo is as fabulous talent. I've read all of his books so far.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|What a fun album - I'm a massive fan of Derek's work before this band, and of Revelator. If you liked Revelator, you will love this album. It's just right in that same groove but adds perhaps a bit more of Derek's touch to a few songs - more \\"space\\" if you will. Love it! The riffs on the hooks and songs here are just intense.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched all three seasons and hope there will be a fourth one. I have really enjoyed every episode and I'm sure you will too!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the last version better. Wish they did not try to fix something not broken.  But, still gives info needed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was such a good book I literally started crying and I'm in fifth grade now and it was just such an awesome book. I chose this rating because it deserves it even more than that. I liked absolutely every thing about it, it just inspired me so much that I completely understand kindness and how sometimes some people aren't always kind. I love it I totally recommend it for every body out there.!!!!!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer's new cd (back to Paradise Valley) is a great piece. It had mainly soft songs perfect for relaxing to. A follow up to born and raised this cd keeps the folk sound on many tracks.<br /><br />1. Wildfire- is a great start to the album, this song starts off slow and relaxed but generally picks up tempo and it and has more of a rock sound to it by the end. Probably the most lively track on this cd.<br /><br />2. Dear Marie- this song is a great follow up to wildfire! It truly gives you a sense of John Myers humble beginnings and how he grew to be the star that he is today. What i loved about this slow tempo song is that it reminds you that celebrities were once just normal people, and still are once you get past the media hype.<br /><br />3. Waiting on the Day- the soft melody and smooth sound of John Mayer's voice makes it easy to drift off to this song. Its very relaxing and a great song to bring you down after a hard day at work. If you listen to the lyrics it is a very simple yet deep list of things he is waiting for, which gives you a sense of the important things in life.<br /><br />4. Paper Doll- is John's rebuttal to Taylor swifts \\"dear john\\". The best part is near the end where a newer version of mocking bird is done by john, truly a unique song and definitely worth listening to!<br /><br />5. Call Me The Breeze- is like an upbeat blues song. The lyrics sound like they came straight from a blues song, the background music however is like a jazz song with a guitar instead of a saxophone. A different type of song than was on this album so far but still good.<br /><br />6. Who you love- the best part of this song is near the beginning. It is a slow tempo song with simple lyrics.<br /><br />7. I Will Be Found (Lost at Sea)- if not the best song on this album it is a close second! This song addresses some of the deeper questions of life, and manages to do so in a simple entertaining manor. \\"maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane\\" is an example of how John does it. A must listen to!<br /><br />8. Wildfire- Is way to short, good lyrics and paints a vivid picture, but missing about 2 minutes.<br /><br />9. You're No One till someone lets you down- has a country sound to it. This song is one of the faster paced songs on this cd, it goes well with call me the breeze.<br /><br />10. Badge And Gun- another great song on this album! I interpreted this song as a plea to the American need for freedom that we all have. It is a mid tempo song with lyrics that make you appreciate all that you take for granted.<br /><br />11. On The Way Home- is a perfect way to end this CD. this song deals mainly with endings, such as summer and life's end.<br /><br />Recommendation- highly recommend it to all John Mayer fans, fans of easy listening, and people who want good music to relax to. This was a great cd and perfect for bringing you down after a stressful situation. 5 stars to John Mayer on his newest cd it is Definitely worth buying!
0385474547|5.0|Achebe's Things Fall Apart is an intriguing tragedy of cultural ignorance, set within a penetrating look at the colonization of Africa. The book focuses on Okonkwo, a well-regarded warrior and leader in Unuofia, a village in the lower Niger valley. Okonkwo is a hard man who has made his way in the clan and the world through hard work. He leads his house with a heavy and unyielding hand, and is driven by the desire to be recognized and titled in his clan. He especially values the traditions of his fathers and their gods.<br /><br />The people of Umuofia believe in a god above the gods who made the world, and who also made gods to interact with the people of the world. These gods are the gods of the land and sky. Umuofia has an oracle who is said to interact with one of these gods, and her word is highly valued. As part of their belief, twins are always discarded in the woods when they are born, and an entire class of people are considered outcasts because they are \\"set apart\\" to the gods.<br /><br />The book opens with the murder of a woman of Umuofia by some men from a neighboring village. The men of Umuoafia gather for war and send an emisary to the neighboring village, and to avoid war, the village agrees to send a virgin and a young man as the price for the lost life. The girl is given to the man whose wife had been murdered. The boy was given to Okonkwo to keep in his house until his fate was decided. After three years, the clan decided to have the boy killed, even though he had become like a son to Okonkwo. And despite advice to the contrary, Okonkwo had a hand in his death.<br /><br />Then one day, while celebrating a burial feast in the town square, Okonkwo inadvertantly killed a man when his gun exploded. As punishment for this offense against the clan and the gods, Okonkwo was banished from the clan for seven years, and he went off to the home of his mother. While there, he began to hear news of white men who were appearing the area. In one town, a white man was killed and then many white men came in and wiped out the village. And now white men had come to his mothers home and also to Umuofia.<br /><br />When Okonkwo returned to Umuofia, he found that the missionaries had started a church and a school, and had also set up a District Comissioner's office and a trading post. They were bringing not only religion but also the sovereignty of the queen of England to this part of Africa. And clashes were inevitable. We see what happens when cultures collide.<br /><br />Achebe has written a vivid account of African life, and a penetrating critique of a colonial attitude toward cultures. The influence of the Western culture truly causes the fabric of Umuofia to begin to fall apart. From one perspective, that can of course be viewed as a necessary influence of the grace and truth of the gospel, a putting off of the old wineskins for new in order to hold new wine. But Achebe also calls into question the enculturation that often comes with the message. Too often we attach our own cultural norms to the gospel message, when the relationship should be much more nuanced. And Achebe's book artfully brings this idea to the fore. I highly recommed it. It is a penetrating book that helps those of us in the dominant Western culture to see things from a different perspective, and to wrestle from the inside with issues that must be confronted in our multicultural world.n was killed and then many white men came in and wiped out the village.

B00ECU34ZM|1.0|No real storyline.  I'm shocked that Morgan Freeman would take a role so weak.  Tom Cruise doin' his think of stunts, shooting, tumbling and rolling around, with a few lines spoken for a minute or so, then 20 minutes of shooting and explosions, then a line and back to the noise.  The noise was so loud that when the speaking parts came and could not hear it.  It made me nauseous and anxious.
B008GJV2OA|4.0|I started graduate school last month, and I am taking an Intro to IR class. This was recommended to me as extra credit.<br /><br />Highly enjoyed it.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|totally family friendly and worth seeing - great movie for all ages, and that is all i have to say but they need more words
0061950726|5.0|I especially liked the writing format - how the author wove the characters into the story.  Keep other books coming!
0857680986|5.0|We lost an earlier printing of the well known title in Katrina and used versions were priced at hundreds of dollars. Thankfully this popular title was reproduced and available to us as new. Also thankful for Amazon for shipping it in a hard cardboard book box instead of in a plastic envelope.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. I enjoy it, if you like the temple run games this is the game for you. Have fun!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Overall it was a very good movie with good acting and a plot-line that kept me wondering what was going to happen next.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Truly enjoyed. Fast . Paced .Kept you guessing as to where it was going. Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|this isn't even an app. it takes you to the Internet to facebook.com. its pretty much a link. no point in this &quot;app&quot;.
B007SSF3O0|5.0|Great story line and outstanding acting by all. Proves you should not attempt to meddle in affairs of the heart
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Three years after The National released the stunning High Violet, the Brooklyn based indie rockers have finally gotten around to their much anticipated 6th LP.  And while Trouble Will Find Me may not be on the same level as its predecessor, you have to admit that the bar set by that masterwork was incredibly high.  Not to worry, though.  This new offering from The National is as thematicaly rich, dark, melodic and hypnotic a work as we've come to expect from them.<br /><br />Matt Berringer's haunting baritone is once again in top form and lends a distinctively undeniable sense of melancholy to the proceedings.  While things aren't quite as bleak as on High Violet, the band still expertly conveys a sense of unease and grief albiet with a little more light shining through the darkness this time out.  Lyrics such as \\"Tiny bubbles hang above me.  It's a sign that someone loves me.\\" from \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\" lend a glimmer of hope to what is an otherwise beautifully sad song.  The group is concerned with themes such as love, loss, faith and isolation and they run throughout the lyrics on the songs gathered here.<br /><br />Trouble Will Find Me may not mark a giant step forward as did High Violet, but it's not a step backwards either.  It is exactly what it needs to be.  A confident and mature work from a gifted band that continues to grow and is still learning how to be comfortable in its own skin.
159463176X|3.0|I LOVED his other books... They had such wonderful and engrossing character development, tension, the buildup, the climax, and the satisfying endings... I expected the same.  I did really enjoy this book but it was truly lacking any kind of build up and suspense compared to the other two.  There were WAAAAAYY too many characters and each chapter in a way seemed like a short story in and of itself.  Did all the stories relate in a way?  Of course, but it was not like a puzzle where all the pieces finally come together in the end.  Sadly each story was just left that - just a story - they never linked in the end in a way that satisfied me.  The ending was not satisfying sadly.  I love his writing and I would recommend this book but not before his first two.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|It was fantastic! A wonderful movie. . well put together.  I will watch again and again! Plan to see it with my grandkids!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|First three chapters were slow, but after the fourth one it became great!! a lot of mistery and action all over!!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Very interesting sex of the explicit kind, but not foolish.  The actors are certainly very brave to &#34;let it all hang out&#34; as they do.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|Really, one of the best OST I`ve listened to in the last years.<br />Ramin D. really knows it`s job.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy it!
B001FB55H6|5.0|Being burned out on most super hero stories caused me to avoid this.  It's too bad because the script, performances, and CGI beat every X-men and Batman .  Their special effects were too flashy, but here they fit in very naturally.  New heroes with abilities, flaws, conflicts, and histories that are only slowly revealed are refreshing.  Inventing a new Bruce Wayne every few years seems absurd now.
0307951529|5.0|these are just perfect for those smaller, regional, tradeshows, where you don't want to hassle with sending a whole booth, or even a simple tabletop display.  put 3 or 4 of these together, and you've got a nice backdrop.  Print up several interchangeable vertical banners, and you can mix & match yourself to paradise.<br /><br />Carry them on the plane with you, and never worry about showing up for a show without your graphics.  Price is right, too.
B004L03B3S|3.0|Pretty good film.  Nice.  Worth a good look. And worth owning, if you like explicit sex that is realistic and real.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|Went to see this in the theater. I can't believe I paid money to see this. My friends and I couldn't stop laughing at how bad the acting was and how bad the animation of the zombies was. Don't watch this.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|it livened up my otherwise boring afternoon and filled in a couple of hours for me. i am sure other viewers  will get a similar response.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I thought I had lost this disc and ordered a new one.  Well--almost as soon as this one was delivered I found the other  and now I have two, but that's Ok.  I have been a fan of EWF for 4 decades,  There music has always made me want to dance..
B005544V6A|5.0|Get dropped right into the action. From the get-go Suits is clever, gripping, and addictive. While any commercial I saw for it didn't even explain what it was about, I realized they didn't need to.<br /><br />Just watch it already.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|High quality anime in almost every regard. It is not perfect however, if you liked the original series or just high quality action anime in general, then this will do it for you.<br /><br />Certainly one of my favorite works, so I am somewhat biased. Possible complaints I can foresee will be the fanservice -- but with no greater frequency than the first or third movie. Also, the characters do get less development. But that is to be expected since it is a movie adaption of a TV show.<br /><br />Basically: guns girls and explosions in beautiful Blu-ray.
B00D1G9ECK|5.0|Another love story by Nicholas Sparks.... always good... love to listen as I drive to and from work....1.30 hours one way each day...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addicting and fun game.  It really makes you think and rewards you by opening the door to another level.
1452110581|2.0|Literally 50 pages long. Half of them are pictures. While cute, I read the entire thing in 30 minutes. A couple of the pieces were clever but also quite predictable. Gave it to my little sister because it just happened to be her birthday when it arrived. She also read it in half an hour... wouldn't exactly call it worth the dollars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|it just keeps getting better and better  keeps you interested in the whole show and very suspenseful makes you wonder what can happen next
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Younger children can play these games.  Was introduced to Candy Rufus games by some young children I baby sat for over the weekend and found the games children friendly.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|While is was sometimes difficult to follow the characters, they were all so alive from the author's description that you cared about their outcomes.  I especially enjoyed reading toward the end, descriptions of actual places I have also visited.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The plot thickens, and thickens, and thickens,<br /><br />I wish I'd never started watching this show.<br /><br />I can't take this anymore...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the devotionals and that it will read to me. It will crash occasionally but not enough for me to.stop using it.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I CANT PLAY IF THE TILE WONT MOV E IN LEVEL 30.. IT JUST FREEZES UP FIX IT!!!!<br /><br />I have emailed developer without success
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I don't understand why this movie version of ' The Secret Garden' hardly received any notoriety when it fist came out. This movie is a joy to watch. \\" Warning\\"!  This movie  may be  a bit slow for a younger audience with the usual attention low attention span.
0143035711|5.0|Action packed. A real good read  A page turner. I flew C 130's in the Air Force in Vietnam from 1969-71. Knew most of the places Mason speaks about and even flew into some if them. Will always remember the sound of the  Huey. Well done Mr Mason
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Certainly this movie was great with special affects and action.  I just enjoy a character driven piece more.  For those who love lot's of action and big bangs, you will enjoy this movie.
B008JFUO36|5.0|OK, so I didn't get all the essential plot points on first viewing, (it was a long day after all,) still I find I'm liking this film more with each showing.  Even with all the familiar themes - he's the one, happy boys need cool toys, \\"The Atlantic Ocean, you should have seen it in the old days,\\" if this is paradise, why 'am I in heels??? - \\"Oblivion,\\" has tweaked my curiosity enough for many future watches.  What more can anyone hope for when purchasing yet another DVD for that over crowded video library?
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Intriguing story line.  Well-acted and produced story.  This followed the book extremely well.  If you like one, you’ll love the other.
0763644765|5.0|Super cute illustrations, it gets the whole potty idea across in a light-hearted, fun, yet realistic way that is simple to understand.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I have seen this movie twice now and loved it both times.  The script is great, the movie moves right along, great dialogue, characters.  It has everything that I look for in a movie.  I can see why it was nominated as a BEST MOVIE contender.  Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are adorable in these roles.
B0062YADWI|4.0|I bought one of these after trying out several other carbiner-type key fobs. I bought several variations of the Nite-Ize but never really cared for any of them. So, I purchased the Leatherman carbiner. It is smaller than I expected but it has a stronger gate than the Nite-Ize carabiners. It hold my keys well and maintains a good, low-profile place in my pocket or on my belt loop. Having one gate, instead of two (like the Nite-Ize) makes this a safer way to carry keys.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Many websites offer information stored in the .PDF format. This app lets me view those files and examine them as needed.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I've been addicted to The Good Wife ever since I joined Amazon Prime.  I raced through Seasons 1, 2 and 3 in record time. I would especially recommend the series to anyone entertaining the notion of attending law school because it portrays a realistic view of what is involved in being a lawyer.  Excellent program and I can't wait to see the future seasons.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So far I have watched all of the seasons and can't wait until they release the next one.  What wonderful characters and story lines.  Keeps you hanging on each episode wanting more.  Loved it!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Am enjoying this app very much.  Love the choices and mixes. Very relaxing and calming great way to unwind after a tough day at work.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When I want to know what personal files are stored on my Kindle, this app lets me look through the internal storage and find information I have stored in the past.
1449415881|5.0|Scott Adams works at my company, or so it seems.<br />Sad that this is often the highlight of my work day.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book at a request of a teacher friend of mine who was going to teach this book to her High School class.  I ended up really enjoying it and relating to the main character.  It brought back a lot of memories and feelings of being young.  The struggles we all go through in school and finding our place in the world we occupy.  I would recommend this to anyone!
0307950654|1.0|It is hard to rate a product that was never received. Guess I want be buying from this book store again. Missed out on reading this one for my book club.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|The MoboPlayer was able to display many videos that gave error messages with the other players I had on my Kindle. My only dissatisfaction was the picture size was a little too large for a few of my videos. I'll have to see if it is possible to zoom out a little if I remake the videos.
1452126577|5.0|Grumpy cat is just so adorable! This book is cute and funny, works great as a little pick me up when you have the grumps yourself!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Just a kick back and read novel.  A simple story, well told, with some excitement mixed in.  Not great but an enjoyable read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|As an adult there is only a handful of animated movies I enjoy. It has lots of little humorous lines throughout the movie. The kids enjoy it ever time also.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I followed this book step by step and I went from 168 to 148 its crazy cause I was skeptical at first I tried a lot of diets pills, teas, wraps and nothing worked but this book really breaks things down thats all I needed was guidance on how to eat better im so happy I bought this :).
B000LTAY1U|5.0|A great watch that operates totally off the grid. Seiko has always represented a great value, very well made. Looks great too.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie, my husband and I.  It was exciting and quick paced.  The acting was good and the script was great.  Definitely a worth seeing film.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I absolutely ADORE this Movie with the Sacrificial &#34;RING&#34; on Ringo's Right Hand Ring Finger as my Aunt Lucy put a RUBY RING on the same finger when I turned &#34;16&#34; Years old and Aunt Lucy told me NEVER to take off this Ring (even after her death). I obeyed Aunt Lucy's Request and My RING Helped SAVE my LIFE with My Special Request of the MOVIE & SONG : H-E-L-P !!!!!<br /><br />FANTASTIC MOVIE !!! KIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!<br /><br />Mrs. Josephine Ann Mary Caiazzo ( I still wear the R-I-N-G ) !!!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Love this movie! We have watched it over the years and know all the songs....we love that it is the type of classic that even our children will love for generations to come!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely a must watch. We initially rolled our eye regarding The Walking Dead... Watched the first episode and we're hooked. It's a wonderful view into human behavior and just how tough the choices become when it's literally life or death. I your on the fence... Try 1 episode... You'll quickly see what we mistakenly thought was just a zombie show is actually a great tale of human behavior. Expertly written, acted and executued. Top 5 TV program!
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|I enjoyed this book but didn't love it.  The story was interesting but didn't really grab me, as I like a novel to do.
0891419063|5.0|This book is amazing on a few levels. The fact it was written first hand. He was there. Second, he obviously kept detailed notes. For example, he mentions after Peleliu, after half of his company were casualties, someone on the ship played &#34;Spanish Fandango.&#34;<br />I went to iTunes and purchased that song. Now I feel I have a connection to the writer every time I listen to it.<br />One of my top five WWII books.<br />Dan
B00C2FFJFM|3.0|this was for my daughter so I can say how it was or not because i have not heard it as if yet
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Hard to put this one down. Very suspenseful. I also recommend the sequel, The Leopard. Harry Hole is a greta character.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was a great ending to the trilogy but it definitely leave one wanting more. Larsson was a great author and could have written many more amazing books on this interesting topic. Lisbeth salander is one of the most interesting characters I have ever read about.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Not boring because this game is multi-leveled. It is easy to move around in and a nice game for the price. Some of these games are not relaxing,but this one is a good stress release.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|it was very and I did not like the ending though.....I wish the ending ended better that all have to say
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is challenging but very addicting.  It's simple at first but gets complex quickly, with different types of stars, powerups, and levels.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Heard about this book from a friend and decided to give it a go. Just a few pages into the book i was hooked. I sat there and bought 1-5 from amazon back to back and borrowed the 6th hard back from a friend. It consumed my life for a little while.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like these kind of games and I think that if you like to look for things tat you will to.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|If I could get it to work on my kindle I would rate it but I cannot get it to download even though it says that I have bought it.
B005HEPN06|4.0|Season 4 is up to their usual standard. I have been watching the episodes every evening and enjoy them all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is just the right level of difficulty to while away a few minutes while waiting on the train. Not too easy, but not impossible. .. I only had to peek at clues for the last room.  Worth a<br />download!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I do not have more to say just that I like these games where you have to go different places to play this game and if you like to play these kind of games you will like it to.
B00DNO3HXC|3.0|I chose three stars because it was okay, I would not watch it again. Unless you really like Holly Hunter movies I would not waste your time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My grand daughters boyfriend recommended this to me. I have no idea why. It is not something I would have picked out to read. Rarely read fiction anymore. I read all night non stop. Fascinating in the most wonderful way. I will always be curious why he suggested it. But glad he did.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I just watched a faux Jane Eyre almost marry a faux Mr. Rochester. This was the story of a hot older boss beguiling and tricking a petrified naive and chaste young woman because she was readily available, and then obsessing over her when she left. The relationship boiled down to just plain creepy.... he was just way too nice to the point of sympathy, and she was way too dull and apathetic to the point of \\"why in heck would he notice her in the first place?\\" And it seems the only reason this faux Jane would even marry him is because he proposed, he had money, or she was sincerely surprised that her teacher-to-pupil like crush actually had feelings for her. If this Jane left her boss/wannabe lover because of principles of her character, that was not discussed or established in the movie. If you had never read the book, you would think she left because she was made a fool out of or just felt stupid... a sentiment I never got while reading. I mean... I even noticed that she kept looking at this one painting of the naked lady on the wall and wondering... Jane, this is your maturity level? Not in the book I read! Maybe they should have had Jane narrate some to fill in the blanks of her character because in the movie she had none. Outside the context of the actual book itself, the only character I found remotely interesting in the movie was St. John, but simply because I saw more character development with him than any other character in the movie. But they totally left out the fact that he and his sisters were her cousins!!! Why in heck would she give 3/4 of her inheritance away to people who she may have known for at most a year? Without the family part... that just sounds stupid, even if they did save her life; it's not like she wasn't working. I was surprised how upset that made me. It sounded contrived in the book when I first read it (a long time ago), but I learned to appreciate that detail, especially when St. John actually \\"proposed.\\"<br /><br />A few years ago Iwatched the 2006 miniseries by purchasing the DVD, and absolutely loved it. Lost the DVD in a move and hadn't thought about it in a while. But Jane Eyre is my all time favorite book, so I decided to get this DVD in a collection with three other movies (including 2005 Pride & Prejudice, which I thought was excellent). This movie had me tearing up my room looking for the 2006 version, to no avail. So I just reordered it. I was so mad after watching this movie, and I've never been what people call \\"a purist.\\" It's just what's the point of making a Jane and Edward with no chemistry? Or a Jane with no passion? Or a Jane Eyre movie where the biggest climax is the secret in the attic? Most people know that fact before the read the book or watch the movie; it the great relationship between Jane and Mr Rochester in the book and their character development, and the way it is described in such a way by Charlotte Bronte that I think only she could make a relationship between  a 18 year old girl and her 38 year old manipulative boss not creepy in the slightest.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because the scenery was pretty. And Judi Dench is excellent regardless.<br /><br />Sorry about my rant. I can't wait to wash my mind with the 2006 version!
140006922X|5.0|I found this book really interesting.  It discusses the political and cultural environment which impacted Jesus' movement, as well as other movements around that time.  This was a very easy read, not at all dry and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in biblical history.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Deserves all the emmys I'd recommend it to all of my politicaholic friends. Do not wait...get it now before the next season.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|But at some point I loaned it to someone. Yeah I know...I've said that so many times, Never lend a book you don't want to lose.  Anyway it's on my kindle now and I'll be able to refer to it whenever I want. I just want to paint...
0307888908|4.0|The Start-up of You book by Reed Hoffman and Ben Casnocha resonated with where I'm coming from as an architect building my business and cultivating my network relationships.  I've been a LinkedIn power user since 2005 and yet this book refreshes my understanding of how, who with and why to use this tool for greater good.<br /><br />There are actionable takeaways at each chapter easily done along the way.  Have already received positive feedback on LinkedIn.  There's also a lot of plain self-promotion common sense with many ideas and strategies able to be adapted regardless of media platform or situation.  I recommend it!  I look forwards to more from this dynamic duo.
B004742Y68|5.0|I loved watching this classic scary movie and being able to show my little ones the stuff we grew up on!
B00C061I3K|4.0|I enjoyed this CD, but it has way more of a throwback feel than I thought it would. I don't plan on listening to it on repeat or anything, but it's fun for a night if you have friends over and want to randomly break out doing disco or something. Not too serious, just fun.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that if you can imagine it you can make it happen. It just gives you the tools to help you do it. No hokus pokus... just clear making sense. Have already reread and sent to friends.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think this is a great game. I love uno its just like im playin with some one in person.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is a cool game I like the dirt bike and the truck the game is so cool you need to play it
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|This album \\"walk through exits only' was a breath of fresh air for me. Some real brutal tracks you can't help but bang your head to. Go buy it!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is awesome! I just love that there is PvP, co-op, and solo for you to choose. Though I would rather that some items has their prices lowered. But otherwise a great game!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely recommend this book. It's so good and I was so sad when i read the last sentence! I never wanted this book to end. So many twists and turns you wouldn't believe it.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Novel approach (at the beginning) kept my attention initially but about half way through I became bored and asked myself &#34;so what&#34;.  Did not finish it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and has the right amount of detail to be very useful<br />I use it every day and love seeing weather in other locations

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love comic books.  And seeing Iron Man, Thor, The X Men, and the Avengers is just a blast for me. As long as Stan Lee is alive I see nothing but good coming out of these movies.  I can only wish they'd do more with them and really dive into comic book hero's and movies about them.<br /><br />Way to go.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Need more information &  direction.  Pain in the rear bouncing back and forth from YouTube video help.  I quit almost immediately because I could figure it out.......
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Would not change a thing. Flexible, easy to use,  I love the graduated alarms which is my favorite feature. Also a timer and short cuts.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game so much more than my other games that I play. This is my very last game that I well EVER play I have also have never seen a game like this before.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a interesting read about the treatment he received from Tom Edison and the Direct Current segment of the evolving electrical industry.  The question I came away is why did we assign Edison's name to current electrical companies.
B00D63W7MM|5.0|These are an inexpensive way to get a balky ESXi server up with multiple NIC interfaces.  They performed perfectly as needed.
B0090SI4OC|1.0|This does not play on a PS3, so 1-star for THIS release of The Host (but not other releases or versions). Its best to try another format such as streaming or normal dvd. It will play in a PS3 if you disable your network settings, but this can cause other problems such as problems syncing with a PS3. Inappropriate quality assurance and testing by Universal for this release/version.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome update came now it's even better!!!! Can't wait for the next update!  It's almost like pc and x box so amazing
B004YKNCKC|5.0|I actually heard the song Dreamer performed live, what a great song and true to his style and artistry.  I had to add the album to my collection.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is really fun.  I cant stop playing.  It is so addictive!  This game is worth getting.  I wish it was the same as the version on bigfishgames though.
B009RH973I|5.0|love this case.. light, thin, pretty color.. protective.. inexpensive.  Love it. I bought my husbands for much more money and I think this one is lighter and nicer.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|Never appeared so there not much to say about it I mean it would of been great haven it but never gotten the chance to use it it had gotten sent to wrong address so they had to send it back to main place
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really did liked it, and I am happy that there is another book after this one, I see it was a \\"trilogy\\" but hey! If the author got carry away, that's cool with me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game, very addictive and easy to understand and navigate. Graphics are pretty good for a freebie. Keep up the good work. Thanks
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I can't view it even with the instructions I received by email. I want a refund. I don't have  the wherewithal to apply all instructions to correct my laptop.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book has opened my eyes.  I should have put two and two together since I was a diabetic and the amount of insulin I take has everything to do with how many carbs I eat.  I love this book.  It goes into alot of history and science but very informative
B007SPPANM|5.0|I love this movie for its wonderful blend of storytelling, realism, and great special effects.  Although the sinking of the Titanic happened way before my time, after watching this movie, I can't help but mourn the needless deaths of so many.  This is a movie I would recommend and is a wonderful tribute to this historic tragedy.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|Did you play the game? You know its about the end of the world, right? Well the music is a reflection of this scenerio. For those of you who know such things....minor keys, diminished chords, dissonant notes. For those interested in the mood...think accoustic guitar, lonely highway, acceptance of fate, but not giving up.<br /><br />Much like the game, if you truly think about it, it is sad. But there is a constant theme of not being defeated. It may be the end of the world, but I will not hang my head. If you have no idea what I'm saying, take the chance and get the music. Yes, it may be a bit emo for constant listening....but sometimes you need some moments of reflection.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This movie is seen by people as a marketing tool. It may be true that the company was able to make new dolls that represented the people like ponies, however how is this any different from the actual show and the youtube spin-offs for example the pony Dr. Whooves (which sold out immediately and became hard to find)?<br />The movie keeps in line with story and I don’t want to give any spoilers but when watched everything will make sense (especially referring to some concept art that was trashed by well-known blogs.) It also keeps in theme with the concept of the show “friendship is magic.”<br />The movie is fun and enjoyable and has the same elements of the show. Kids and adults who love the show will enjoy it. The animation is good and feels normal, and the characters feel like the characters that people have come to love and enjoy.<br />So don’t listen to the Nay Sayers and be yourself, like show promotes and see for yourself and if you enjoy it you do, if you don’t then you don’t.
B000OXHRRC|3.0|A fun movie but seemed to be guided by the formula of &#34;Under the Tuscan Sun&#34;. I can imagine the natives of these various regions are growing weary of these cardboard depictions of them and their communities.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|The remembrance of this book is the same after having read it as a young woman, absorbing and filling. I am happy to fill in the blanks left by the years, and by movies of the same name. Thank you Miss Bronte.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I get it...some people hated the ending. Some loved it. Some were emotinally moved by it; others were not. But that's the way the show has been the whole time. This season was no different.  What I can tell you is that things start to make more sense after you can watch it again.  Did it answer all the questions presented through the 5 previous years? No. But I didn't require it to either. I watched it for what it was....and it was good (not Season 1 good, but still good).
B000GCFG7E|4.0|This is my second Reacher book I have read.  Very entertaining.  Well worth reading.  Reacher is a very believable character.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I love cats and recommend this book to everyone. It is one of those books you don't want to end.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Its nice romantic comedy, worth the renting it. It's also cheaper on Amazon.com than iTunes or Netflix. I recommend this movie.
B002XOTPU2|5.0|Loved the YouTube vids of Simon's Cat and while I was looking around for something fun to put on my Kindle and this showed up I was thrilled.  When I first started looking at the pics I found them kind of hard to see (because it is the Kindle version), but once I figured out how to turn it horizontally it was all good.  Simon's Cat is hilarious and I love all the trouble he gets into.  Very Cute and highly recommended, although I hope to get my next Simon's Cat book on paper which I think will highly add to the experience.
B00005J9PB|1.0|I couldn't play this item because it came from overseas. I will not buy any more of this type. They. should not be allowed to sell in the United States.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I was and still is pretty epic and I always find myself waiting for the next up date. Over all, Best game ever, 11 out of 10.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|It took a long time to download.  The streaming seemed to stop and skip alot.  I still have it, only because it's free.  I will eventually get rid of it because I really dont use it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Needed more character development.  Storyline was good, but the characters were one dimensional and lacking.  Found it difficult to even like the story line because at points it was unbelievable based on the characters that she set up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very similar to temple run, but with twists and additional boards that keep you playing for hours and hours.  Love it!
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|This was a cool movie. I really enjoyed it. Pumped for the second one. Streaming wise through Amazon was great. Had no issues at all!
B004NELBPC|5.0|Love it!  Just enough of the latest news to stay up to date, but not a long drawn out story
0307730700|5.0|Adam Brown is a modern day hero. Like many heroes, his life was humble, his story largely unknown except to those in his circle. I am so glad that Eric Blehm took the initiative to tell Adam's story! It is a heart-tugging, inspiring, motivating story. What makes this book so captivating is the man who is it's hero. Eric Blehm presents Adam Brown in full color, no blemishes removed, but also in full glory. Adam went through some very dark times - as a young person enjoying success and popularity but then feeling lost and aimless and turning to drugs. Adam's family and friends persisted for years in loving him, and eventually, strengthened by their faith in him, Adam courageously fought his drug addiction and became a selfless member of the elite Navy SEAL Team SIX. \\"Undaunted\\" is a word that keeps coming to mind as one reads Adam's story. He faced emotional and physical barriers to becoming a Navy SEAL, but refused to give up or give in. His wife, Kelley, was steadfast in her belief in Adam and likewise undaunted by the extreme challenges that life as his wife brought. It's a great story about an extraordinary man who rose above every challenge in his life until the moment he gave his life on a mission of freedom. It is also a testament to the brotherhood of the members of the SEAL Team SIX. Not having a military background myself, I enjoyed this glimpse into that elite group. It was obvious to me how much Adam's SEAL brothers thought of him, how highly his family and friends regarded him, and how unselfish his life and service to his family and country were. This is a book men and women alike would enjoy. It is a story that deserves to be told, a story that in turn is inspiring others to face their own challenges. I received this book on a complimentary basis from Waterbrook Multhomah Publishers for purposes of review, and am not required to give a positive review. 5 out of 5 stars. For more information, visit the website: [...]
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I am absolutely addicted to this game concept.  It's challenging but not so much that you want to quit before making progress.  I just wish there were more levels!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was great.I liked how the author told different  people instead of just August the main character.I also like how there were somethings bad but everything turned out good like most books =/ if u don't read this u will regret it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is the gross factor that I don't like but I love the story of all these characters.  You just feel like it would be a personal loss if one of them dies.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies from one of my all time favorite shows! I ordered it this time for a fathers day present.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A fast paced novel with a surprising twist that keeps one guessing.  A light-hearted look at the prison system and of course, our dear friends, the lawyers.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|This is about my all time favorite CD. I even bought a tee shirt to help support this band. Amazon always is quick to deliver.
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|We like the show.  It is well-casted and written.  Our biggest issue is the characters' use of God's name in vain.  It happens a lot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before I even knew what minecraft was,I had no idea what that it would be loads and loads of fun. Of course the first one I played was Xbox 360 Edition. But then I started playing minecraft pe version. Witch was way more fun. And definitely with the 0.7.3 update because it added double-chests. And Sun,moon,and stars. Of course.<br />:b

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book! I would've gave a 5 star but it wasn't long enough. I was happy, stunned, mad, sad, and ecstatic. I wish there was a follow-up to Connor and Megan's story.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Reacher is always a great read.  Sometimes the frequent &#34;coincidences&#34; in Child's books are a bit much, but the adventure, combined with the dominance of Reacher's personality, make the books worth the time.

B00DL47ORO|3.0|Blackfish mostly follows the story of Tilikum, an orca captured in the 80s when he was a mere pup, and his rise to fame and infamy within Sealand of the Pacific and, eventually, SeaWorld.  Known to be involved in the deaths of three trainers, Tilikum's story is tragic both for the whale and also for the trainers, some of whom did not truly know the dangers of working with him.  Thrown into this mix are some anecdotal stories about other killer whales, the number of \\"accidents\\" involving killer whales and trainers and, for some random reason, a whale's sexual organ on display.  I know Blackfish has received a lot of positive press and reviews, but honestly it left me feeling pretty nonchalant.  Not about the travesty that happens to these whales or the tragedy befalling the trainers.  That obviously hit home.  But the documentary seemed all over the place and wasn't really put together very well to make a cohesive whole.  Random parts of the film seem pulled directly from YouTube, and just when it seems like it's making a point, it veers off into randomness; for example, for no real reason we go from the tragedies happening to seeing a pod of whales in the ocean attacking a sea lion.  I didn't really see how this added much to the main thrust of the story, other than to pad the already slim running time.  Additionally, while they tried to make a point of showing how the aggressive Tilikum is used to breed for most of the whales in captivity, I don't see why they had to focus on his, er, erupting member.  I now know that it looks like a tentacle.  So, you know.  I learned something.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the documentary is that I left not really knowing more than when I went in (erupting member, aside).  The other problem is that it feels cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions.  How anyone could watch the footage of a whale calling out to her young that's been ripped from her and not feel pathos is beyond me.  And that's exactly what the documentarians are counting on.  It sometimes feels manipulative.  But I say this not as someone who's on the side of SeaWorld, but as someone who definitely agrees that these beautiful creatures should be able to roam free and not be forced to do ridiculous tricks.  I just don't like to feel like I'm being manipulated.<br /><br />At one point, the documentary tells the viewer that SeaWorld was asked repeatedly for interviews for Blackfish, but they were (here's a shocker) turned down.  Obviously, SeaWorld knows that the documentary is about lambasting them, so why would they submit to it?  Yet, it's played off as if the directors are trying to be fair and balanced; Fox News follows a similar tactic.  Look, Blackfish is a one-sided documentary, telling its viewers things they probably already know: animals in captivity = bad; animals in captivity + interacting with humans = worse.  Worse for the humans interacting with an animal that can't really be domesticated and worse for the animals who have been robbed their freedom.  The best thing the documentary does is show real human emotion for these majestic creatures, often showing how social and family-focused they are.  It's just so jittery in its narrative focus, bouncing all over the place, that in the end it doesn't really make a concrete point, other than one that we can probably reach on our own.  I enjoyed it and I think it's worth watching, but I don't think it's constructed as well as it could have been.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't think there is high enough praise available for this book.<br /><br />It's a love story, with cancer, and it will break your heart but you can't turn away.<br /><br />I normally don't like emotionally manipulative books, which this one does do, but it subverts the expectations.<br /><br />I have heard books described as a 'Punch in the Gut' before, and I thought that was hyperbole.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I finished this book after one am on a Wednesday night, and I immediately wanted to shout it's praised from the rooftop.  I wanted to call all my friends from high school, and tell them I loved them, and that even though we don't talk as much as we should I still cared.  (We lost one of our group to cancer when we were about the character's age in the book.)<br /><br />I didn't, since I am a grown up and I had work in the morning.<br /><br />Buy this book.  Read it.  Just don't read it in public.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Had to have it for my X-Men movie collection. Good beginning for everyone and gives us answers to a lot of questions.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The best game I have ever played, though I don't know if it's just with my kindle, but the chests are invisible when I place them or if they are visible they will become invisible when I leave the world and then come back.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|When I first saw this movie I wasn't expecting very much but man was I in for a excellent surprise. This movie blew me away with its take on the superhero genre and it most defiantly is one to add to your collection.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Kept me laughing and didn't take itself too seriously. The cast blended well together and I will watch the sequel.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been trying to loose weight for a while, and had hit a plateau.  I purchased the 30 Day Shred, to up my exercise.  The first time I did it I thought I was going to die...but I made it through. I had rotator cuff surgery 5 months ago, so some of the exercises are a bit too much yet, but I do the best I can.  As I kept doing it, I found it easier, yet still challenging.  It is taking me more than 30 days to get to level 3, but I dont mind.  The work outs go really quick too.  I have lost another 10lbs in one month thanks to this video, and more are sure to come off as I keep going.  Also my endurance has greatly improved ( i can actually go running without dying), I am also getting more toned (no more flabby arms and abs!!).  This workout is perfect for people that are busy and cannot sit at the gym for an hour or more everyday, but still want a good workout  It will leave you sweating and panting, but I cannot argue with the results.  Just keep pushing yourself.  If I can do this video you can! :-)  Thanks so much Jillian for making this video..I cant remember ever feeling this good. :-)
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie had a so-so plot but plenty of action and I enjoyed it.  I love seeing these actors play off of each other.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was real excited to finally get this...now that it won't work with my Verizon FIOS network not so excited....done everything they asked...now to get this thing to work I will need to spend the hours on the phone to get it setup.  Although I have to say I'm not confident it will ever work.<br />Save the cash and frustration get yourself a big monitor and a wireless mouse and don't buy this beta product.
B00005JM02|1.0|The one disc is defective toward the end.  Requested return - no reply from supplier.  Cannot not watch as it &#34;freezes&#34;.  Waste of money on this one.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Only reason I didn't give it five stars was the organization of the book was a little odd and hard to follow. This was really eye-opening and wrenching.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|My daughter had to read it so I did with her.  It was a lovely story.  We had great conversations!
B002PEP4QY|5.0|I had no idea that this book would be transformative. If you think this is just a book about a drug-induced delirium (as I did), you will be shocked at just how deep this book goes into our psychology as human beings and our biological perception of the world around us. Highly recommended.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Love the bonus features on this blu-ray disc. The quality of the movie is great on my blu-ray player, I havent download the ultaviolet yet, but i hear it isn't great.
B004S5D3B6|5.0|I love the idea of it being a true story that happened not too long ago, with the original people having input on the story.  It was a great movie overall too.
0618871713|5.0|I really liked this book.  Alison Bechdel is a gifted artist and writer.  This is a really good read and gives you true insight into her<br />life, development, and maturity.  Definitely a great discovery.

B009UZBLSG|5.0|I purchased the Analogix Slimport adapter for my Nexus 7 (2013).  I plugged the micro USB connector from the adapter into the Nexus 7 and connected the HDMI output from the adapter to a Sony Bravia TV.  I played a few YouTube HD videos on the Nexus 7 as a test.  The adapter worked without issue.  The image on the TV was pure HD.  The picture was very stable, with no jerkyness to the motion.  It simply plugs in and works.  I've only had the adapter for one day so I cannot attest to it's durability but it seems to be a solidly built adapter.  It has a charging port built into the adapter.  I will be interested to see if my wall charger will satisfy the power drain while using the Nexus 7 as a video source.  So far, the Slimport adapter has exceeded my expectations.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Works very well for the price. Go for it. It works great with my zi8 pocket cam for web video recording.

B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|At first, I didn't know whether or not I'd like it. I've used several apps in the past as a tool to determine times, location, best routes, etc., while driving. I've not found an app that was either accurate, timely or efficient. So, I was reticent about using another one. Wow, was I in for a treat though! This started off as a great app. I was able to control location, settings and menu items right away. I wondered how many others were using this app and it didn't take long to see. It's one thing to have a million users but if you spread that out across the USA, that's not many per location! I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were a lot of Waze users around my neighborhood as well as on my way to work! It's saved me a lot of time, headache and stalls in traffic! I've thoroughly enjoyed this app and I use it every day. Great application for travel for long distances and the daily rat race to and from work, school, etc.<br /><br />I'd LOVE to see a way where Waze could give some room to Pandora at the bottom or top or even side to the screen so I wouldn't have to flip back and forth between these apps to give Pandora a thumbs up or down on their random music! Other than that, this app is great!
B008476HBM|4.0|For a high school student, the language of this book took some getting use to. However, as soon as i got the hang of it i began to realize the striking underlying message of the book. Great read for students especially for those in AP English!!

B00DMM3WVM|2.0|This is a knockoff of another game I used to have I just forgot what it was. The controls were terrible on my kindle, and this was the main reason I deleted it. I tried in different settings and it just did not do what I wanted it to do.

1451626657|4.0|The title of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 (1961) it also the novels key concept, which Heller introduces on page 46 of chapter 5, Chief White Halfoat. Heller employs the story of Halfoat's people (p. 43-44) to frame this concept: \\"Every place we pitched our tent, they sank an oil well. Every time they sank a well, they hit oil. And every time they hit oil, they made us pack up our tent and go somewhere else. We were human divining rods.\\" The way out for Halfoat was to join the Army. \\"Only the army saved me. Luckily, the war broke out just in the nick of time. . . . I was the only survivor.\\" However, like Yossarian and the pilots in his squadron, Halfoat soon discovered that he had gone from the frying pan into the fire. Rather than continue to comply with the white man's demands, Halfoat \\"had made up his mind to die of pneumonia,\\" which he eventually did--inadvertently confirming the hopelessness and futility of escaping the finality of a catch-22 dilemma.<br /> Heller employs conflict theory to emphasize and critique the social, political, and material inequality of various social groups by drawing attention to historically dominant ideologies and power differentials based on nationality, ethnicity, class, and gender. What is  unique about Catch 22 is Heller's use of a bottom-up approach reminiscent of the work of James Scott in Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1987), in which Scott demonstrates how ordinary, powerless people in repressive situations still manage to resist and even influence policies through actions such as sabotage, foot-dragging, and gossip. Yossarian's prolonged stays in the hospital to avoid combat; signing censored letters \\"Washington Irving,\\" or Irving Washington,\\" or \\"A.T. Tappman, Chaplin, U.S. Army (p. 8);\\" moving the Bologna bomb line (p. 119); or the exploits of other characters, such as ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen, who \\"distorted, destroyed, rejected or misdirected any correspondence by, for or about Colonel Cathcart that might do him credit (p. 215), are only a few of Heller's many fine examples.<br /> Heller's popular appeal is to a wider, somewhat disgruntled and disillusioned, postwar population all too familiar with top-down policies, elitist favoritism, and bureaucratic bungling. His novel also serves as a scathing tongue-in-cheek rebuke of democratic process and capitalist philosophies (Ch. 24) run amok, where average persons have little or no say in events that affect their lives. This is especially relevant for readers of the 1950s who, having survived WWII and Korea, find themselves living under an omnipresent cold war shadow of communist expansion and potential nuclear annihilation. Heller's message is clear: what's good for elites, politicians and business is not necessarily good for you.<br /> The strength of Heller's work comes from his status as an insider and WWII combat veteran. However, his position as an educated and privileged officer and pilot, combined with his overuse of ubiquitous humor, literary allusions, clever repartee, amusing retorts, sharp and witty aphoristic conversations, chauvinistic depictions of women, and his characters constant whining and complaining--disturbingly reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie--has an alienating affect that distances the reader from his message. As many have noted, it takes several readings of Heller's work to grasp the subtle nuances of his meaning--like trying to interpret the bible--which is by no means an endorsement of his work. Yet all things considered, Catch 22 is an innovative endeavor, well worth the effort, that has certainly withstood the test of time.
1401301010|1.0|I got this book, for my Daughter because he is a big Red Hot Chili Pepper fan. I ordered  for her. and I received the book without the cover and book has marks and lots of damage. Do not trust this seller.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|When I became aware of how long this thing took to download I never actually installed it. I tend to steer way from things like this on a tablet. I have the PC version from steam and I really like it, and it would be neat to have it on my tablet, but would just take too much space.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. God bless Marcus and all those who have served.  I really wish they would make a movie about him.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This story will keep you involved as it switches time frames in the character's lives.  The plot is set during the WWII bombing of London, and it will keep you guessing as to the eventual outcome of the main character's lives.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game, great graphics. Time for build great. Upgrades get a bit too expensive. Kids like it too.  Game loft has a wide variety of games I play four of five myself. No complaints hear. Thank you very much.
B001R22TBI|5.0|Katie Melua's blend of pop, blues, and jazz, with her own twist, is fantastic.  With lyrics AND rhythms that are easily understood yet not simple, she does music in a unique way.  She can be powerful, AND soft and soothing.  Love her.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The third book is the best one so far.. If you´ve read the previus 2, &#34;A feast for Crows&#34; continues with the same type of narrative that  Martin uses.. wich i think its quite easy to read, not boring at all, with a nice pace and with losts of cliffs hangers...<br /><br />So far, the actions and plot twists in this book are amazing.... I seriusly recomend it... I loved it!

B001UGB1X8|3.0|First let me say, I have enjoyed every James Lee Burke I've read or listened to. Strong characters, good plot, excellent story telling. Unfortunately, the video, In the Electric Mist, based on Burke's novel of a similar name, is a jumble of scenes without much continuity. It's as if the screen writer grabbed scenes from the book and put together the script without much thought.  If you haven't read the book, this story is hard to follow, at best. On the other hand, I wouldn't let this video stop you from reading Burke's books. He's a superior author and knows how to tell a story. Unfortunately, this video doesn't do his story justice.

B003WKOU0G|3.0|Babies need to grow up...particularly the American ones -- they were the worst of the lot.

Very hard to read at some points, but so very well written, Jaycee's voice comes through clear and strong, and you weep for the 11 year old ripped away to live out a nightmare, while also seeing the strength of her soul, her will to live, and how beyond all of the pain, she found joy. I'm glad one of her wishes came true already, 'to be a best selling author' I think with this book she's accomplished that one, and should be so very very proud. I wish for her future, he daughters, and family/friends, they are able to continue to heal, to grow and to stay away as much as possible from the public eye, they deserve that at the very least. Love & Light Jaycee, you are a true hero &#60;3

B000H5TVKI|4.0|Stallone has always fancied himself a real theatrical talent.  Actually he's a bit of a hack but knows (knew) how to tap into that machismo that rallied a flagging Hollywood during his time.  If it wasn't for Stallone we wouldn't have had the plethora of pathetic action films that engorged the box-office ever since. Give me Bronson, Eastwood, or even Bruce Lee but spare me those who can't even pronounce their own names.  That said - & please forgive my self-indulgence - First Blood is a pretty cool movie.  Stallone is a little too intense, Willis would've been a little too cool for it & Schwarzenegger too goofy.  The best part about First Blood is it has a fairly good story-line; simplistic though it is, it's easy to follow & to get where both the protagonist & antagonist are coming from. You root for Rambo but don't entirely despise Teasle. This is one of Stallone's better and dare I say more durable movies.  This will be remembered along with Rocky if not much else of the Stallone cannon survives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was amazing!!! I can't wait for Season 4 to start. The cast is fantastic ... it was hard to see cast members leave the series.

B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This UK series is clean, quick-witted, intense, elegant, sexy, sophisticated and entirely wicked. It's a stunning, if not wildly exaggerated, insight into British party politics and the party machine.  It's too long a series - 3 discs & out of memory 12 episodes - to go into any critical review detail here but what I can say is that there isn't a single wasted moment in this highly entertaining series.  It may be too subtle for some American audiences, but most will find it enthralling. Ian Richardson is perfect as Francis Urquhart (F.U) the British Prime Minister for most of the series and gives the role a Machiavellian soul that Spacey (U.S version recently released) cannot seem to find. Richardson is mischievous, highly intelligent, supremely wicked and almost entirely one or even two steps ahead of his rivals throughout. He also likes to 'put the stick about' roughing up his colleagues as he shapes the political landscape of Britain. Above all, which I cannot derive from the American series, you understand that F.U genuinely believes that what he does is for the good of the 'empire' and you cannot help but to be somewhat sympathetic towards his cause(s) - which is what makes for the best of villains - you love 'em & hate 'em simultaneously. better by far than the latest version but perhaps a trifle dated and with less production value (though for this series imperceptible).  The latest version is slick, beautifully photographed and also well acted but it just lacks the voltage of this original version.
0064471837|5.0|I wasn't into reading when i was young, until i read Sabriel by Garth Nix. This book is fantastic, and is the first book i read from cover to cover without stoping. Sabriel is now a book i rate all other books quality on. I've read nearly everything by Garth Nix, he is an author that can bring the characters to life. This book will always have a place on my bookshelf and is one i will read again and again. Sabriel is a must read for any fantasy readers, aswell as Garth Nix's other books like The Key's To The Kingdom and The Seventh Tower series.[[ASIN:0439551234 Mister Monday (Keys to the Kingdom, Book 1)]][[ASIN:B003S73ESM Seventh Tower Complete Set 1-6: The Fall / Castle / Aenir / Above the Veil / Into Battle / The Violet Keystone]]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had a lot of ideas of how this last book would turn out. I was wrong and it got me by surprise at every chapter. Best read I've ever read.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|The lost city was the first game I played on my Kindle Fire and this game close second. I would have liked to see another chapter or two.. I will be purchasing a sequel the day it comes out. Love these games!! Keep up the great work...
B0064MT1U8|3.0|This movie is quite fine but nothing extraordinary - despite it's awards - & in my view it must have been a pretty lean year for this to have collected as many as it did.  How Gwyneth (whom I adore) won the Oscar over Cate Blanchett I'll never know (well perhaps I do - it's America & almost  everything is - for the most part - fixed). Nevertheless her performance is adequate and the story is charming with Geoffrey Rush stealing a lot of the impetus. It's definitely worth a watch but don't revisit it too often otherwise you'll become a cynic like myself.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|Who would think that such a cramped, singular setting ( a small new york apartment)<br />could unravel such a hilarious bag of sarcasm, anger, schock, drunken silliness and<br />understanding..Hi-larious
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its an awesome game and u recommend it to everyone. I still think that stuff shouldn't have to be bought with our own money
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I am intrigued with the idea of time travel and all of it's associated paradoxes AND I will normally watch anything with Bruce Willis so I couldn't wait to see Looper when it came out on Amazon Instant View. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great too and last but not least Emily Blunt is in it. How can you be a guy and not be in love with Emily Blunt?  But back to Looper - I am always curious how the writers and directors will handle this sort of a film but I was very satisfied with the issues of time travel. Of course you have to buy in to the idea anyway but a bad storyline will ruin it now matter how willing you are to buy into the plot. This movie didn't disappoint in that regard. I highly recommend this film.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|A surprising piece - very underrated for its chill factor let alone its laugh factor. Pity the disc has no special features though; I'd love to have heard a commentary on how they pulled some fairly big-name stars into these tasty vignettes, my favourite being 'Father's Day'. And you gotta love the comic-book construct of the whole piece!
146500632X|3.0|The packaging was great, it was exactly as pictured. I thought it was a 2014 calendar though, so I had to order another one. My fault though for not reading the description good enough.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|What was once a fun game is now awful....takes your credits, coins, items.  Has made it almost impossible to get shadow cards and even harder to win.  The orange non-tradeable items is a joke......just not liking this game at all anymore
0756405890|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss is an awesome human being and an amazing writer.  I can appreciate that he wrote a really good book but still think it's boring, right?  It was witty, dramatic, funny, believable and fresh....with little action.  I guess I like my fantasy books to have more....you know, fighting and wars and stuff.  I will continue reading this series, because I have the impression this first novel was merely setting the stage for future awesomeness.  I like the modern crop of fantasy, I must say.....Martin, Sanderson, and hopefully Rothfuss should keep me entertained for a good couple years.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|Blu Ray transfer is o.k but not strikingly so.  Lots of pointless features but lacks a commentary track which in my view is often the only feature worth having.  It is so obvious that Star Trek lifted its premise virtually direct from this underrated movie - which for its time had great special effects and a plot that could have been a Star Trek episode itself.  A plot  that not only drew from Shakespeare but toyed with the mind as well.  Weakest part of the movie is the animated Id monster, but I guess had I watched it in 1956 I might have been nevertheless impressed. Its also nice to be reminded that Leslie Nielson was not just a (brilliant) comedy buffoon but a slick dramatic performer as well.Anne Francis' legs are distracting treat and of course you have the introduction of American film's first major Robot star...but I still favour 'The Robot' from Lost in Space - in which Robbie also appears.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's the best of the series so far. My mind is blown. You won't regret starting these books.<br />- MM
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is imaginative and fun.  Since I have lived through many of the political times that the main character lived in in his flash backs, its even crazier.  It's a challenge to see the political powers from a non-American point of view.  I've been recommending it to friends and family already and I just finished it a week ago.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|cute chic flick with a  good cast. Good ending! I love mindless silly movies where you can just watch and enjoy without having all  the ugly words,
B003B02O0A|5.0|Love the movie,finally read the book.  The reason for the verdict happening was a twist from te movie.  Great read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, I didn't have any idea what this book was about or where it was going to head -- what a page-turner! Looking forward to seeing it come to life visually when David Fincher makes the movie with Ben Affleck as Nick and the other well-casted actresses and actors. I highly recommend this book!
B0017VV816|5.0|Always the best and inspirational movie, great job for Stallone which launched his career for the rest of his life.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very addicting game and fun to play. I played for hours. No hints if you get stuck, so you'll just have to figure it out or get really mad! :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great start to finish. I read the whole thing in 2 days lol you def need to read hunger games & catching fire first, obviously. Def 5 stars
B004J4WKTW|3.0|My daughter and a friend both recommended this book to me, they both really liked it. I was not that taken with it, I thought it<br />was different but wanted to stop reading it several times. Think you need a love of magic and the circus!
1451627289|5.0|this has been a great book.  Arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent shape..read it and add to those who enjoy
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I wanted to get this for my daughter who loves horses but every time I would try to download the app, it would get about 1/3 of the way and just stop downloading and be stuck. I tried quite a few times over a few days with the same result. The farthest it got was 66%. Good thing it was free or I would have been calling customer service! If it downloads for you, that's great but it wouldn't on my Kindle Fire (original version). :(<br /><br />UPDATE: I was finally able to download it but it certainly wasn't worth it. I wish the little helper guy would just shut up instead of constantly reminding me, \\"It's time to feed Beauty! It's time to exercise Beauty! It's time to clean Beauty!\\" Just shut up and let me play the game, instead of telling me what to do and when to do it. So I haven't been back. It's got high quality graphics but unfortunately that seemed to slow down the game and make it freeze a lot. Nice concept but poor execution.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This movie was quite confusing and I feel the plot was too cobbled together.  It needed more clarity and less going on.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Best show ever on TV. So well written and each episode is so believable.... recommend to everyone I know. Great acting.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Such a classic movie!  I can watch it over and over and not get tired of it.  Both my wife and daughter love it too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Some of the best that TV has to offer. Superb scenery and stellar acting make this a complete viewing package.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is the best app ever I love it so much and its free nothing better then an awesome and free app
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|It is an awesome capture of the good, the bad and the ugly.  This is a group deserving of a documentary like this and it is well done and entertaining.  It explains so much that I didn't understand
B00A5052YE|5.0|Let's be honest; I would have bought this one just for the cover photo!  What a Beautiful Lady!<br />And since I am a fan, I have to say that I am not disappointed with this album from front to back.<br />Alicia Keys is such a talented singer and musician; I never get tired of listening to her music.
B000002JNJ|5.0|All that needs to be said about this album is, that it rages up there with the best first albums from almost any band.<br /><br /> I saw these guys open for Exodus and Suicidal on the 'Kill or be Killed' tour, and they blew both of the other bands right off the stage: Literally.<br /><br /> And ... It's Dime's birthday today. Enough said! CRANK IT UP!<br /><br /> HAPPY BIRTHDAY DIME! I'M HAVING A BEER FOR YA! YOU WILL ALWAYS SHRED AND BE ALIVE IN THE HEARTS OF METAL FANS ALL OVER THE WORLD.<br /><br /> R.I.P. - MY BROTHER IN METAL.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Do not be concerned about how long the movie is. The storyline is excellent and entertaining. I am mad I waited this long to watch it for the first time.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is perfect for infants.  If it falls from their mouth they can get it back without it falling to the floor.
