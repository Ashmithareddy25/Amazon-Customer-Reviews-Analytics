0061914177|5.0|I recently read &lt;u>Crush It&lt;/u> by Gary Vaynerchuk, a book about Web 2.0, social media, and how to leverage the numerous resources on the internet to market your brand. Vaynerchuk used hustle and determination to grow a family liquor store from $5 to $50 million within a period of about 8 years. He then built on that success with the creation of [...] where he provides insight into all things oriented to wine. Through the use of social media, WineLibraryTV has become an enormous success. Vaynerchuk gives lots of great insight into building community for your brand including such platforms as Twitter, Facebook, uStream, Viddler, YouTube, blogging, and podcasts, amongst a host of others.<br /><br />The title \\"Crush It\\" comes from identifying passion and what the person or company enjoys doing more than anything. By engaging in the identified passion and utilizing the Web 2.0 marketing tools, the company or person can Crush It, Blow it Up, or other terms indicative of outstanding success.<br /><br />Vaynerchuk makes a good point in that once you identify your passion that you should work at it at full speed, constantly. The only drawback to the book is that it is in written form. With the social media landscape changing so rapidly, perhaps Vaynerchuck could work with organizations such as Amazon to release an ebook version every 6 months or so to provide updated content based on new innovations. &lt;u>Crush It&lt;/u> could become to social media what &lt;u>What Color Is Your Parachute&lt;/u> is to career guidance.<br /><br />This book is good for anyone looking for a fairly comprehensive look at social media and how to leverage it to enhance your passion and brand.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I'm not going to waste time and write a lengthy review. All  I  want to say is that I think this CD rocks. I've been listening to the Scorpions since Animal Magnetism and I wasn't disappointed in this CD at all. The classic Scorpions sound is there and Klaus Meine sounds excellent. The CD is filled with catchy hooks and melodies. Listen for yourselves I think most Scorp fans will love this. The people who say that it's the worst release and it's embarrassing clearly have other agendas or possibly are stuck in some time warp.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|My wife turned me on to her 10+ years ago and its been wonderful ever since. When we get some time to ourselves I'll put on a Sade mix (the longer the better ;-) and get the warm oil for back rubs and have a very pleasant romantic evening. Having grown up in the Barry White years, Sade pushes poor Barry aside like so much yesterdays news and reminds us of the sensuality of women; which I for one am eternally grateful! This particular CD is as good as anything that shes done in previous years but admittedly the CD tracks did (many) sound quite the same. Thats not a bad thing mind you...as it IS Sade afterall...but if you're looking for something breakthrough or different from her, this isn't it. This is Sade in all her voice and (at times) wanton lustiness...enjoy it with your loved one, you'll be glad you did  ;-)
B0036XN2L2|4.0|Originally formed in Hanover, Germany in the late 60s, Scorpions have over 40 years of experience as a band with some incredible hits under their belts. With their first album dropping in 1972, Scorpions are now in their 38th year of recorded material and it is reported to be their last. As the first track, \\"Raised on Rock,\\" opens, it is easy to point out similarities to one of their biggest hits, 1984's \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane.\\" Don't think that's because Klaus Maine, Rudolph Schenker, Matthias Jabs, and company have run out of ideas; on the contrary.<br /><br />They simply tip their hats to the sounds that made them rock royalty while pursuing a conclusion worthy of their storied career. With Sting in the Tail, Scorpions have released an album of classic rock that stands with some of their finest releases of the past.<br /><br />Although hints of their hits can be heard throughout, Sting in the Tail does an excellent job of combining the old with the new. The production is crisp and clean with an emphasis clearly placed on modern compression techniques that maximize the volume potential of the band, but the music still has that classic vibe that made them famous to begin with.<br /><br />Meine's vocals are shockingly present and don't appear to have lost any of their hard hitting ability. Singers typically show their age on ballads, but when Scorpions slow things down on \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Sly,\\" Meine's voice soars over the mix without ever sacrificing a high note. Both power ballads utilize the same gradual build in dynamic throughout that is so characteristic of their sound in the eighties. \\"Lorelei\\" even makes use of the classic call and response harmonization on the chorus fans of the classic rock genre adore.<br /><br />Scorpions continue to be the masters of a decade that has long since passed. For that reason, it is unlikely Sting in the Tail will make much noise on the charts, but for longtime fans, this will be the goodbye they have always craved. For those new to Scorpions, I highly recommend giving Love at First Sting a play through first, but Sting in the Tail is a worthy competitor.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Quiet Riot, Kiss<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Raised on Rock\\"ommend giving Love at First Sting a play through first, but Sting in the Tail is a worthy competitor.    Similar Artists: Quiet Riot, Kiss    Track Suggestion: \\"Raised on Rock\\"

0380715430|1.0|Sadly, Bill Bryson is most definitely not qualified. The book is sloppily researched all over, and Bryson's cheerleading for English as in some way superior to most other languages is tiring.

0760316414|5.0|I found this book to be very insightful, and intriguing, as it touches on a wide variety of design information. And I think there must have been quite a bit of editing done, because the sections are really an overview, not in-depth / step by step- with regards to technique, but more of a show case of design work to Illustrate the works from students, and professionals in the field. This book doesn't cover what they teach in the design schools, It's more of a guide, or glimpse into the design world. The book is broken into 4 sections:   1) What is Design?   2) How to do it.   3) History of Design.  4) reference.   Being a design student, I found this book to be a welcome addition to my design reference library, and I would recommend it to aspiring designers.
0547258305|5.0|I loved this book. Im a parent of four teens and I truly enjoyed this book. I read whatever the kids do and they tend to read whatever I recommend. I loved everything it said and all the things it didn't say and just implied. After finishing it in two days I handed it to my son, who is an avid reader, and he read it in one whole day. He shyly stated \\"he was more Katsa than Po\\" and laughed. Even the \\"slow\\" parts weren't that slow. I love that she was not afraid to go outside 'norms' or societies expecations and make Katsa very real and her and Po's relationship quite honest. I truly would like to have explored more time w/ Po, or been able to go into his kingdom. The end just made me want to know more.<br /><br />Going at lunch tomorrow to pick up Fire....sorry amazon, i'm not patient enough to wait for the book to be ordered.
1439152756|5.0|Read from March 24 to 25, 2010    review:  Still Alice by Lisa Genova is the story of Alice Howland. Alice is a brilliant psychology professor at Harvard, wife and mother of three grown children who has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. I am not going to lie this story is absolutely heartbreaking and I had a hard time reading it through all of my tears. I don't think I have ever in my life cried so much while reading a book! This is the story of Alice's downward spiral into this devastating disease, she is stripped of her career, memories and her sense of self. Still Alice is so heartbreaking but at the same time so beautifully written that I found myself physically unable to set the book down. This story will stay with me for a long time.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best TV series ever.  Bring it back already!  5 stars.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|UPDATE - I just assumed the album was \\"the new album\\" and didn't look around too much when it came out.  Now that I have it, and have seen the reviews of others, it turns out we in America got ripped-off!  Someone posted about an itunes bonus track - it turns out this is a half-truth.  Itunes has the full European album, while the American release was SHORTED one song (a rocker entitled \\"Lets Rock\\")!  Amazon.uk has the supposed \\"bonus\\" track, while Japan got an actual bonus track (\\"Thunder and Lightning\\", which makes it a 13-song album), which I assume is another rocker by the title.  The annoying thing is, given the pace-killing excess of ballads in the latter half of the American release, they could've IMPROVED the album by taking off two of the four ballads, and used those ballads as the extra itunes/European/Japanese tracks - then I would've been happy with what we got, but there would've been something to seek for collectors.  So, if you just want the cheapest edition or are going to put it on your ipod, the American version might be fine, but otherwise, I'd suggest spending a few extra bucks and ordering through Amazon.co.uk or waiting a month and getting the Japanese import.  END OF UPDATE           Well, for a little more than the past decade the Scorps albums have been a mixed bag - \\"Pure Instinct\\" was good but short on rocking, \\"Eye II Eye\\" dabbled with R&B and other lame pop influences, the band dabbled with acoustic and orchestral reworks of older songs, and \\"Humanity Hour I\\" (although when it rocked it ROCKED) was overburdened with songwriter/producers and too many slow songs (or parts of songs) that made the overall album drag.  Only \\"Unbreakable\\" delivered the classic (80s) Scorpions good-time rockin' metal.  Well, if this has to be the last effort, it's not bad.  Although it still does have a bit of songwriter/producer influence (the first and last song are pretty much not written by the Scorpions, except a vocal co-writing credit), it's much reducedfrom the previous album (looking at the songwriting credits of \\"Humanity Hour I,\\" there's about 5 people writing each song, with never even two of them being members of the Scorpions - and you can tell by listening to it; one of the songs sounds a LOT like a similarly producer/songwriter written Aerosmith ballad from the late 90s) - there's even songs that are completely written by the boys in the band on \\"Sting In The Tail\\"!  (Interestingly enough, if you look at the excellent \\"Unbreakable\\", you'll notice the great music was . . .  written almost entirely by the band).  I think the fact that they keep letting outsiders have too much creative input in their music is may be a good sign they are indeed ready to retire, though with albums like this and \\"Unbreakable\\" I'm sad to see that happen.      The good news is that, even for the producer-written songs, they sound like the classic Scorpions here (probably \\"Face The Heat\\" is the sound this reminds me most of).  Although, when it did rock, the \\"modern\\" sound of \\"Humanity Hour I\\" was pretty cool, it's nice to hear the Scorps going with their distinctive sound.  The songs are good, upbeat rockers for about 7 songs.         My only complaint is that (to give another Aerosmith comparison, they did what Aerosmith did wrong in the 90s), they made a mistake by over-ballading it - 4 out of 11 songs are ballads, and the last half of the album alternates ballads and rockers each song.  This just does not work, and I can't believe bands and producers don't realize it.  My personal opinion is that a hard rock/metal band should have 2 or (at most) 3 ballads on an album, and should space them out with at least 3 rockers in between  - ballads sound good because they're a change of pace, but you have to create that mood with a couple rockers in a row, or they just become boring.  You can pull off an album of mostly mellow stuff, but you have to make the songs a little more musically interesting (which the Scorps succeeded in with \\"Pure Instinct\\", in my opinion).  Alternatively, just put the ballads all in a row at the end so I can rock out and then chill out, but to alternate fast/slow every other song just doesn't work.          So, overall I would almost be tempted to give this album 3 stars due to the poor pacing issue, but after almost 40 years, and this being their swan-song, I'll forgive the Scorpions that because the songs are all classic Scorpions and the first 2/3 of the album is great (the last bits are fine songs, just the pacing ruins it for me).  This should please any fan of the classic 80s/early-90s Scorpions.

0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels & Demon so much so I was looking forward to this book. The first half of the book seems up to par, with the usual Dan Brown suspense/thriller vibe. However, towards the end, it was more of a blah...blah...blah..., nothing much to it. It's like he was just filling in the pages. There was no big revelation at the end, somehow even a disconnect to the first half of the book. As in the past 2 books, every event, every character somehow ties in together, this one failed to do that. I wish I could get back all the sleepless nights I lost trying to finish this book. Oh well......

0307266303|4.0|I wasn't a runner when I read this book.  I've watched my wife over the past five or six years run, limp, moan, and run some more, wondering why she keeps doing it.  I never understood with the $$ we spent on shoes, the running articles she reads, and her youth being coached at running; how she and other runners continue to be in such pain and injury prone.  This book did an incredible job at showing me why this happens.  (Somewhere in there he tells a story of a crazy, most unlikely race.  It's the reason I picked up the book, not the reason I kept reading though)<br /><br />As I read this book, I couldn't help but discuss what McDougall was writing with my wife.  By the end, we are at polar opposite ends of running.  She will continue to hold true to her pillowy, over softened, over supported bright colored running shoes.  I will eventually train my feet and legs to run barefoot, or close to it.  I'm convinced, McDougall argues great points to ditch technology and get back to basics.  I'd like to have seen more counter points discussed to the points he brings up, it's a little one sided.<br /><br />Back to the story being told.  I have to agree with others that the writing style is like that of a magazine article.  I could see this book being written as a serial of numerous articles in a magazine.  The story itself is interesting, and quite entertaining.  That said, I didn't think it added to the book in my opinion.  Other words, I would have enjoyed the book with or without the story being told.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|..mind-blowingly, cringingly, staggeringly bad. In fact, so bad that it's almost classically bad and therefore worth watching. Every maudlin clich&eacute; beloved of American cinema (estranged husband-wife, boy meets girl, in the midst of total catastrophe) is marshalled and sent into battle. George Gershwin's immortal lines<br /><br />\\"In time, the Rockies may crumble<br />Gibraltar may tumble<br />They're only made of clay<br />But our love is here to stay.\\"<br /><br />essentially sum up the film, except you get to see something similar to the first two lines happen in real time.<br /><br />Between the clich&eacute;s and the scientific/technological impossibilities (neutrinos changing into different types of neutrinos???) are the special effects, and these are (just) sufficient justification for watching this appalling turkey, for they are indeed spectacular.<br /><br />What's especially amusing is that the Chinese get the big manufacturing job - is there a moral there somewhere?
B0013MWVYC|5.0|This book has really changed the way I think about difficult problems and emotional challenges. Examples from real-life and clinical research are woven together to make the reading enjoyable, informative and inspiring. The questions at the end of each chapter are valuable instruments for re-training thought processes, gut reactions and social responses. Carol Dweck's findings have been helping me to understand and overcome the faulty belief systems that had kept me in a mental rut of educational stagnation. I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to parents, teachers, coaches and those in places of leadership.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|this Rochester is way too young and \\"pretty\\" to be believable in most of the film (even when he is supposed to be blind and disfigured his make-up is flawless except for a little  spidery skin on the side of his eye.) The story is pretty faithful to the story line in the book until after the botched wedding, then there is a bedroom sceene designed primarily to sexually heat up the viewer but which de-rails the sense of the film which becomes murkier and murkier from then on. I prefer other versions in which the dialogue is more reticient and ironic.  The version with George C. Scott has much better dialogue and better casting although unless you have read the book, it would be very hard to understand the full plot in that version (and the DVD version is even more chopped up)
0061438294|5.0|My first positive impression about the book came from the title that I found ingenious; the second, from the well structured table of contents; and third, from the pictures and real life examples that illustrate in a very clear manner the concepts presented in the book.<br /><br />From the feet up to the face, Navarro and Karlins explain in an easy and well illustrated way the different non-verbal behaviors to look at as indicators of confidence, comfort, or stress. They also clearly warned us about possible pitfalls if one fails to consider the baseline behavior of a person or possible cultural differences. This is a book that I can certainly recommend.

0393072231|5.0|This book is terrific in several respects.  First, Lewis continues to excel in combining concise, cogent exposition with brisk choronological narrative.  The book flies by - I think I read it in under three hours.  Second, he pulls no punches.  When people make stupid decisions, he tells you so. Third, it really provides a lot more insight into the financial crisis than any other book and certainly than the general media.  Most financial journalists, academics and pandering lawmakers have only a superficial understanding of what happened in finance in the 2000s.  Lewis grasps and presents it thoroughly. The only important things that he doesn't cover are (1) who the nonWall Street buyers of subprime risk were ( there are generalized refernces to buyers in \\"Dusseldorf\\" for instance and it is clear some stayed on the books of Wall Street intermediaries and of course there is AIG but no numbers are reported and you have no full picture of where all that stuff wound up) and (2) the role of Fannie/Freddie as vectors for the disease of excessive mortgage lending and housing price inflation.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a splendid book. I'd noticed it mentioned on Amazon and in newspaper book reviews without thinking too much about it. On a whim, I decided to order it and read it. As other readers have found out, once page one is turned over, it is difficult to put down. The plot is new, different, and fabulous in the unfolding. The translator had good work to translate, but to his credit, that is also an excellent job. The sentences just sparkle and the characters are enormous regardless of their physical size as in the \\"girl\\".<br />It is also nice to learn something as well as be entertained when reading, and this book was informative in the names, geography, and customs of Sweden that were woven into the progress of the story.<br />I usually only say this once a year, for obvious reasons, but this is the best book I have read in the past year. I look forward to the next two in the trilogy with great anticipation. What a pity that they will end the writing of this fine author who has recently died. This book not for the faint of heart, but the reader who wants to experience some memorable characters, a  clever plot and all around good literature, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is highly recommended.

This is a movie about the end of the world, it should be thought provoking and frightening. At the end of the movie it should leave you disturbed and wondering. Actually I was disturbed and wondering but not in the ways that I should have been. I was disturbed that anyone would bother to make a movie this bad, one that had SO much potential, and wondering how anyone could possibly think that this is a good movie.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. But the best movie adaptation wouldn't work without Amanda Root and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott (Root) was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth (Hinds), but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter (Corin Redgrave) is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" is a very different story than Jane Austen's other novels, mainly because it was the last book she wrote before her early death -- it has an older heroine, admiration for the self-made man, and a sense of bittersweet resignation to lost chances and old loves. And the movie adaptation is very faithful to the original novel, and maintains the same mixture of romanticism and realism.<br /><br />The only major problem with the movie is that it moves... very... slowly... throughout the first three-quarters of the movie. But it has Austen's subtle wit (\\"My offer to flatter and adore you all the days of your life.\\" \\"I haven't had a moment to turn my mind to it\\") and delicate romantic interplay, as well as some delicious harpooning of puffed-up aristocrats, social climbers and nasty relatives.<br /><br />Root is absolutely brilliant as Anne -- she's not pretty, but her enormous liquid eyes give her a quietly striking quality that is much rarer than mere prettiness. And she does a great job with Anne's quiet despair at ever getting married, particularly to the one man she loved. And Hinds is equally amazing as Wentworth, a strong, intelligent man with a deep inner fire. The scene in which they finally come together in the street is staggeringly powerful... although the passing circus is kind of distracting.<br /><br />The adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel is a polished, slow, slightly bittersweet love story about a second chance with the one you love. Be persuaded -- \\"Persuasion\\" is lovely.... very... slowly... throughout the first three-quarters of the movie. But it has Austen's subtle wit (\\"My offer to flatter and adore you all the days of your life.\\" \\"I haven't had a moment to turn my mind to it\\") and delicate romantic interplay, as well as some delicious harpooning of puffed-up aristocrats, social climbers and nasty relatives.

This seasons has a lot more character development than the previous season to me. The show also maintains the balance of comedy, horror, and a drama like the previous seasons. Fans of the show will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The bluray packaging contains 4 discs. The disc are all in one case and the case comes in a sleeve. The case looks like a regular bluray movie release which makes it very small and compact. Discs are all held in place tight because of the small case so it will not move around. Look at the 2 customer images to get a better look at the packaging.

B000JLSLZG|5.0|It is the best film ever made about The Arthurian Legend and is likely to remain so.  Sir Thomas Malory would love this film.    This fantasy spectacle is extremely well done.  The picturesque renaissance-style armor is very romantic and Pre-Raphaelite.  Though the armor is not of \\"Arthur's time\\", one could not imagine these knights wearing anything else.    There is clanking and banging of sword against sword, sword against armor, and men wearing armor riding around on horses wearing armor.  There is armor everywhere!  Perhaps hundreds of suits of armor were made for the film.         And the costumes are beautiful.  Flowing gowns and dazzling jewelry - why don't women dress like this all the time?  The Lady of the Lake is perfect and Pre-Raphaelite.      By the way, if you are a Helen Mirren fan, she has never looked better and she is dressed to kill.    One cannot imagine a Merlin that is not Nicol Williamson or a Morgana that is not Helen Mirren after seeing this.  They were terrific. (Their chemistry on screen was aided by a personal feud going on in real life at the time, according to Boorman.)    The music in the film is remarkable.  Dark and moody classical passages, ethereal vocals, and brass fanfares. All enhance the fantasy.    Some notes:     This story is basically a pagan myth.  Malory's version adds Christian aspects to the story.  The saints among the magic and potions of the Druids doesn't really make sense.  To take a sword that is empowered by a Druid spell and knight someone in the name of St. George, St. Michael, and God isn't logical.  It seems that Christian aspects were imposed on the original story.  Some think that Malory was commissioned to Christianize the Arthurian Legend, though there is no proof.  I only mention this as a possible explanation why these things are mixed together.      J.R.R. Tolkien stated in an interview that he believed the whole story to be a prank by the French.  Also, it was one of his motivations for writing \\"TheLord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\".    In closing, I want to say that no facts will ever get in the way of this story.  This is a wonderful story and a wonderful film.    Now, it's available on Blu-Ray. [[ASIN:B000JLSLZG Excalibur [HD DVD]]]
1439190275|5.0|This book is not a fad diet, it is a tested and proven solution to weight loss. It shows that the key to weight loss is restricting carbohydrate intake to lower insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone released by your body to bring down your blood sugar and either use it as energy or store it as body fat if it is not needed as energy. What this diet does by restricting your carbohydrate intake is to lower the needed insulin in your blood stream that allows your body to actually burn your body fat for energy. What is so amazing about it is that by limiting your consumption of carbs you get off the roller coaster of eating high sugar foods for energy then spiking your insulin release, then your blood sugar drops to low and you have to eat again. This is a bad cycle to get stuck on and leads to obesity in our population. I have personally lost 50 pounds using the principles of this book and kept it off for years.<br />  This book is an updated version of the Atkins diet. It explains clearly the importance of eating a large volume of low carbohydrate vegetables with the protein and fat that is allowed. It also explains how you still must use common sense on portion sizes and not eat unlimited calories through the foods that are allowed. The other areas that has tripped people up in the past on the Atkins diet is not drinking enough water and not getting enough sodium which this book addresses.<br />  The diet plan consists of four phases, induction, ongoing weight loss, pre-Maintenance, and lifetime maintenance. You start at 20 grams of carbs a day and end up with the amount of carbs that allows you to maintain your ideal weight. I found that I was able to lose and keep off weight at around one hundred carbs a day. Your final amount will depend on your activity level and your carbohydrate sensitivity. This is an optimal protein diet not a high protein diet. This diet also ends up as a right amount of carbohydrate for you diet not a low carbohydrate diet forever. This is the correct way to eat based on biological science, and has been proven in many studies noted in the book. On this diet you can choose to eat healthy by using salmon, chicken, turkey, or even tofu as your protein source. If you are a vegetarian you can choose to start at a higher carb phase so you can do Atkins with beans and brown rice or soy products. The science of this book is the key to losing weight and I know personally because it worked for me when nothing else did.e correct way to eat based on biological science, and has been proven in many studies noted in the book.

B001QERPDO|5.0|When I first heard \\"Breakeven\\" on the radio a few months back, I thought to myself, \\"Who is this?\\"  My ideas bounced from Maroon 5 to Jason Mraz to One Republic to Coldplay, but this band didn't sound specifically like any one of them.  This music was unique - the vocals were just beautiful.  I was stumped and anticipated that once this song came to an end, the station would hopefully state the name of the band and the name of the song.  That radio station certainly did.  The Script was a whole new name to me.  After scoping out this band on You Tube, I not only came to the conclusion that this band is totally fierce, but also that I had to get this album.             The Script album is pretty amazing and enjoyable from start to finish - easily one of the best albums I've ever had.  It's not very often that a band has the ability to create an array of songs on an album that are all so good, and yet so different from one another.  Each song has something uniquely stimulating about it, and the stories in this band's songs can be related to by the listener in some way or another.  This strong and diverse collection includes songs with Reggae or even Rap-like persuasion, \\"Have You Seen Kay,\\" \\"Together We Cry,\\" The catchy song \\"Rusty Halo,\\" took me back to the days of Sting and the Police, as it had almost a pop rock to even a punk rock feel.  Ironically as well, the lead singer's voice resembles Sting's voice slightly in \\"The End Where I Begin.\\"      The Script's emotions explode through the vocals and musical accompaniment in the strong ballads \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" and \\"Talk You Down,\\" which both pull right at the heart.  In \\"Fall For Anything\\" the lead singer and band sing and play a pep talk to all those girls who fall for the wrong guy and his stunts again and again.  \\"Breakeven\\" and \\"Before the Worst\\" are just two other Script powerhouse songs that rock on this album and show off this great band's versatility.        Just as unique as each song they've created, this band is extraordinary.  Not only are the lead vocals and harmonies so unbelievably beautiful with the lead singer's incredible vocal range; but also the instrumental accompaniment of The Script's music (guitar, piano, strings, percussion, bass, etc.) perfectly accents each and every song.  This band is so very talented; I can't wait to watch them get bigger and bigger.
1400052173|5.0|Ms. Skloot is a profound talent.  She took an obscure topic and through apparently relentless diligence and unfathomable patience with the people involved, she created the most compelling book I've read in years. The book is an absolute page turner - on a subject I could never have imagined holding any interest for me whatsoever.  As a former journalist, published author and literary agent myself, I found myself incredulous every time she went back to Deborah after an altercation or extreme rudeness; when she was willing to spend her own money to pursue a book without the guarantee of remuneration (agents cringe at this thought!); when she evidenced such poignant compassion for the characters and their numerous hardships.  This book is as much an exposure of Ms. Skloot's excellent character and true gifts as a writer/journalist as it is a book about Henrietta Lacks and her cells.  Absolutely 100% recommended.  Fabulous job!

B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Schumacher's Phantom is a beautiful lush extravegant interpretation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's show.  The scenery and costumes are spectacular, as is the music, of course.  Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine.  Gerard Butler makes you sympathetic to the Phantom, and for an untrained singer, he nails the songs beautifully.  Patrick Wilson is charmeing as Raoul.  The other supporting players entertain and some, such as Simon Callow and Cyrn HInds, provide comic relief to a production that could otherwise come across as campy.  The bonus material is very entertaining and informative.  Cast and crew from the original stage production in London, are interviewed.  Then there is behind the scenes footage from the film, with interviews and insight into how the film was made.  I would definately recommend this film, and have.
0307271862|1.0|Loved Wallander on PBS and have been madly reading Scandinavian mysteries (on Kindle) since.  Waiting for the Kindle version of the first Mankell version, I noticed that the Man from Beijing was unrelated to the series, so I tried it.    First if you have ever written a college paper that held few meaningful facts, but you \\"filled\\" it with useless, mundane blather, this may be your book.  What started as a typical Swedish, ice cold, dark mass murder which I found compelling enough to spark my interest, turned into a rambling dissertation on the (failed) genius of Mao and Communism.  Every formulaic, hackneyed expression was dripped into the dialogue;, \\"Was that somebody or a shadow watching me?\\"  \\"Had somebody creeped my room and my luggage?\\" \\"A phone call in the middle of the night or a dream?\\"    Give me a break, this should have been a short story to relieve the reader of the long agony of a simple plot.     Mankell should exhort his love affair of the Marxist thought outside his mysteries.    I hope Mankell's Wallander series is better written.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Despite being a newer film and all the acclaim, it's a lot cheaper than the other animated blu-ray movies.    If you haven't seen it, it's a very grown up movie which kids absolutely adore. My daughter loves the action scenes.  Truly amazing, I had very little expectation after being disappointed by Wall E and teaser trailer looked so infantile, but man was I wrong. I am so glad they made the combo pack affordable so we could have blu-ray at our house and dvd and grandparents.    also on a side note, studies show for younger kids anyway, better to watch same thing over and over than variety, as they anticipate what's coming and they learn phrases etc.. I can't think of a better movie to emulate and learn from.

B000002KKD|5.0|In 1980, a strange little person in the French Quarter mentioned a band called the B-52's to me.  I paid him no mind.  In 1981, when I thought Blondie was the limit, my best friend, apparently much hipper than I, played this album for me.  I later bought it, and my brain was never the same.  At times in the 80's I played it so often and so repeatedly that I thought I would go mad.  I finally had to put it away and leave it alone, so I could regain my tenuous grip on reality.<br /><br />The B-52's were New Wave pioneers.  \\"Rock Lobster\\", influenced by the vocalizations of Yoko Ono, is of course a New Wave classic.  But oh, there is so much more.  \\"Planet Claire\\" combines tacky space-horror-flick music with lyrics like \\"Some say she's from Mars/Or one of the seven stars/That shine after 3:30 in the morning/WELL SHE ISN'T!\\"  My favorite track, \\"Dance This Mess Around\\", is a brilliant mish-mosh of Shangri-Las melodrama, Supremes pop, 50's and 60's dance fads and wacky teen soap opera.  It begins with great solemnity:  \\"Remember...when you held my hand/Say, remember...when you were my man\\", and it goes on from there.  I can't begin to describe it totally.  You just have to hear it.  In \\"Lava\\", a song about hot love, Fred announces \\"I'm gonna jump in a crater\\", and Cindy and Kate respond nonchalantly \\"See ya later\\".  Track #6 has the very logical title \\"There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)\\", but it mentions other heavenly bodies:  \\"You better move over/Here comes a super-nova.\\"  And if Petula Clark ever heard this version of \\"Downtown\\", I hope her sense of humor was intact, because if not, she probably wanted to go sharpen her axe.<br /><br />The songs, musically spare and slyly obliterating the then-reigning (and declining) disco sound, consist mostly of minimalist clanging guitar, choppy and/or eerie keyboards, and slashingly witty lyrics with on-target vocal delivery by all.  What you have to understand is that in spite of the wackiness, this album works as serious music, or maybe I mean to say \\"music to take seriously\\".  How, I'm not sure.  That's the beauty of it.ous music, or maybe I mean to say \\"music to take seriously\\".  How, I'm not sure.  That's the beauty of it.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|I hate to go against the wind here, but this movie was too tense, too extreme. This movie reminded me of the tribulations of Job in the Bible. The movie's portrayal Chris Gardner's pain and hardships never ended until the final 5 minutes of the movie.     Was this \\"really how it was\\", this extreme. So many questions: Questions like how did he afford to pay for the childcare expenses when he had no income, yet had to stay at a shelter? Did he really have to leave work early to pick up his child at daycare in an attempt to get to the shelter before it closed at five o'clock?     More obvious questions like: Why would he allow his child to go thru such foreseeable hardships when he is offered a reprieve from the boys mother. Let her take him for awhile, at least until he's established enough with an income and a place to live. No, instead, he just says, \\"you know you can't take care of him\\", so she leaves, no contact with the child for presumably at least 6 months.     One obstacle after another, ninety minutes of being abused, humiliated, degraded, all while caring for a five-year child.  This was like water torture having to watch the pain one man is enduring. However, I couldn't help but think was his misfortunes time and time again overdone, way overdone. Did he really have his 5-year-old child with him while he had no income for six months and lived in various shelters?  Was his income really completely dependent upon selling medical equipment that nobody wanted, and that two were taken from him, which he did recover after great misfortune. Were the horrendous misfortunes, one after another really true? If they were, how did he not go insane?  Well, it turns out no. Most of it was made up-\\"Hollywoodized'.  In real life, things were not as bad as portrayed in the movie, thank goodness. The greatest problem encountered by Will Smiths character in the movie was that he was not given a salary while training at Dean Witter. So his only source of income was selling hislast few pieces of medical equipment. This was not enough to sustain him and his son in any stable housing, which lead him to seek out various shelters. Well, after doing a little research about the real Chris Gardner, it appears most of what was portrayed in the movie is not true; it's a greatly fictionalized account. He was given a stipend at Dean Witter of $1000 a month while training, and most important he didn't' have his child with him while he was training with them, so all the rushing to shelters before five o'clock with his son didn't happen. So many examples of the truth being stretched to make a more compelling drama, but for me, it was way overboard.  Mr. Gardner's true-life story is a very compelling one. I have not read his book, only synopsis of it.  However one thing about his true life is apparent, he was not a Saint, yet the movie goes out of its way to almost portray him as one. He is not a bad man either. He is just a man, a man who had many hardships and disadvantages in his life, all of which he did overcome and become a great success. As stated however, the movie seems to want to go out of it's way to show a Saintly genius, one with the ability to overcoming one tragedy after another, endure more one pain, one more humiliation, one more unbelievable mishap after another, all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. Then, only in the last one-minute of the movie, right before the ending credits do we read a few lines that now he is a millionaire. Everything's ok. I would have been more pleased with the real life story of Mr. Gardner's life, not the emotional rollercoaster we were deliberately put through for ninety minutes. I'm sure it's a great success story, and I'll be happy to watch the real story if it ever comes out.      As a side note, Will Smith's portrayal was excellent; his real life son did a great job in his film debut. Every actor was good; all the sets were excellent, just that little thing about the story went too far.

1439190275|5.0|This book is well written, in an easy to understand way, that will give you the knowledge and tools necessary to live a healthier and skinnier life. In my first two weeks I have already lost 23 lbs. But more importantly, I FEEL amazing. I have more energy than I have had in a LONG time, I don't feel bogged down, I am NEVER hungry, and I feel empowered. If you read the studies both for and against it, it is OBVIOUS that Atkins is not only an effective weight loss method, but a healthy forever way of life. I am so eternally grateful to Dr. Atkins, and those who have continued his work that has helped so many people, now including myself. Buy and live this book, and you will look and feel amazing!

B001TOD92C|5.0|I watched this film last night for the first time on DVD. My partner was turned off by the initial violence of it and left the room, but something about the authenticity of Mickey Rouke's character, (Ram), glued me to my seat and compelled me to follow this story through to it's conclusion. I am glad I did, for this film was one of the most powerful character studies I've ever witnessed.<br /><br />This a very different film, in style and substance, from any I had seen. First of all, I have no interest at all in wrestling, and have always thought the 'sport' to be fairly ridiculous and wondered how people could actually pay money to watch such an obvious farce. But wrestling is not the substance of this movie; it is simple the chosen theatre in which we get to examine life through the eyes of one of it's main characters.  What we have here is a penetrating insight into a battered man, two decades past his prime, searching for an identity and purpose in a world into which he finds it increasingly difficult to fit. In watching this film, which is a world of all-too-real gritty reality, we enter into Ram's psyche as he tries to hang onto meaning in his life. One powerfully feels what Ram feels in this film, which really is a masterful feat of acting and directing.<br /><br />There are moments in this film I was brought to tears.  Most affecting for me was his attempt at reconciliation with his angry and estranged daughter, and how his own human frailties screws that up. Anyone who has suffered a close family 'disconnect' can relate.  Very moving was Ram's attempt to enter 'normal life,' as he tried to embrace his new job behind the local deli counter with enthusiasm, and shared kindness, joyful spirit and humor with the customers. Still, it was his past fame that would ultimately corrupt that path. Like most of us, we are continually haunted by who we have been in the past. His attraction and love for a stripper, played by Marisa Tormei was also very heart-wrenching.  As one of his only 'friends', they were a dysfunctional match, yet it was so affecting to see him gradually make himself emotionally vulnerable to her as he desperately desired heart connection with another. But as we see in this film, timing either makes or breaks such connection attempts. Although chemistry between the two is obvious, she would keep a steel cold wall of self protection around herself. Eventually, you see her heart begin to melt with compassion for Ram, but it is too late. One cannot help but feel great sadness for the tragedy of a missed opportunity for mutual healing through love.<br /><br />This is film about reality, and as such, it's not always a feel good one with a happy ending. I ended up feeling great compassion, empathy and love for the character of Ram and for Tormei's character and his daughter. In some ways, he is the archetype of every man. Rourke and director Aronofsky reveal the subtleties that go on inside a man's heart and soul with penetrating brilliance - all cast in an environment of brutality and gritty nastiness. This film doesn't give us an ending, but instead leaves us to make up our own and contemplate the meaning as the picture goes black and Bruce Springstein's song begins. At this moment, I sat stunned. I understand 'the why'. And I feel for this fallible, but immensely likable man, caught in the web of his own identity that has been spun out the necessity to survive. All in all, it was a highly emotionally moving story of human character, told with great skill and sensitivity. Highly recommended.only 'friends', they were a dysfunctional match, yet it was so affecting to see him gradually make himself emotionally vulnerable to her as he desperately desired heart connection with another.

I think that City of Glass had more character development in it, and while it still had tons of action, I feel like I wasn't overwhelmed by it like I was in the other two books.    There was definitely a big twist in the story, but I figure out what it was pretty much from the beginning.  I really liked the ending of the story.  I think it wrapped up nicely and I liked the way it went.

It's interesting for those who have read the series multiple times to see a new story in between the tales we all love. It also gives you backround into the gods and goddesses of Greek culture, the creatures and the weapons used. There are also great biographies of the cast of characters that we have come to grow and love throughout the series. I highly recommend this.

0061122416|4.0|Paulo Coelho was more then an author he wrote songs and worked in the theatre business. One of his most famous works was The Alchemist, published in 1988. Although this novel wasn't successful at first it later sold 65 million copies and was translated in 67 languages. This landed him a Guinness world record for most translated book by a living author.    The Alchemist tells the story about a young boy named Santiago who lives the average life of a Sheppard in Spain. Things begin to twist when he decides to literally follow his dreams. The first part of the book deals with the boy trying to begin his journey on the right track. This is probably inspired from the author's own life. Paulo didn't get to become a novelist right away; he studied law then dropped out and did a little traveling of his own. Santiago seeks help only to become set back until he runs into an old man who oddly takes an interest in his life. This is where the novel truly begins becoming unique form the rest.  The old man leaves the boy in wonder when he tells him of \\"The world's greatest lie\\".    The second part shifts the setting from Spain to Africa. Santiago is now far from home and runs into some setbacks. Including being in a new world alone and afraid. He's not alone much after that. He is told of people just like him trying to find their personal destinies' and the paths they choose. The boy later meets another odd character, an alchemist who is the last person to influence him. The alchemist uses fate and omens to help train the boy for the rest of the journey awaiting him.    This story is told in third person I think this fits the book quiet well, it gives us a better perspective on how the boy struggles, and grows from it. The genre is fiction; it has many magical and religious symbols. It has motifs dealing with inspiration and will power. The people he meets are all symbols of different paths. An example of a magical symbol is omens. The boy relies on omens though out the book. Although its fiction you tend to forget that as you read because it's so easy to relate to Santiago's journey.    The book is a good and easy read. The Alchemist is an inspirational happy story with many morals to personal success. It's the kind of book that can persuade you to keep trying. Something I can say I took from it is sometimes we must loose things we've settled for to move on to better things is life.

There are also moments in the book that are moving.  Like the way he handles his brides' deathly sickness and how he still treat her well, even though they both know she is going to die soon.  Then when the story switches to the science parts, you can really learn a lot.  The investigating that is done about the exploding space ship, The Challenger, and NASA is very informative and interesting, how NASA, made the poor decision of not postponing the launch.  I would deffinatelly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a good book, and learn about interesting science at the same time.  I gave this book a 4 out of five because it's interesting while at the same time you learn about interesting science topics.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Ok i know that everyone says that Avatar was \\"the greatest move ever.\\" not even close.  and more importantly, it's being brought back into theaters with new footage! talk about a dick move james cameron.  seriously, just put it on the dvd if it means that much to you.    Avatar was visually very nice, all the pretty and shiny colors are quite distracting, then you realize the plot. which is prety much fern gully.  with no music.....it's little big man meets fern gully.  sorry avatar fans, its the same crap on a shinier backdrop.
1439190275|5.0|I have hesitated to write a review because I am one of the success stories in this book.  However, in light of T. Colin Campbell's unprofessional attack on this book, I believe I must speak up to share my story and the good health that has resulted in my following the Atkins plan.  I am nearly 65 years old and have struggled with weight all my life.  I've been on many diets including a vegetarian one with little results in either weight loss or improved health.  In fact, my health markers were getting worse, and I suffered from arthritis, dry skin and elevated tryglyceride levels.  My blood pressure was borderline. Since following the plan outlined in this book, I have lost weight, my arthritis has improved substantially (particularly in my neck and shoulders) and my dry skin (which 2 dermatologists had diagnosed as rosacea) has disappeared.  My tryglyceride level dropped remarkably, but more importantly my HDL (the good cholesterol) has gone up and my latest BP was 117/76. I used to wear a size 18 -- now I wear a 6 or 8.  All of these results came from following the plan outlined in this book.<br /><br />What disturbs me further about T. Colin Campbell is that he has clearly put out a call to his vegan followers to come to the Amazon site and give bad reviews of this book, as he posted this nonsense on his webpage.  I don't have a problem with their chosen lifestyle, but I do have a problem with the many deragatory posts that make it clear that they could not have read this book as they have no comprehension of its contents.  Shame on them.  Using the Amazon review system to grind their vegan axes should not be allowed.<br /><br />Contrary to their ravings, the Atkins diet recommends lots of vegetables, a conservative amount of dietary protein and good fats.  All recommendations that are supported by recent science. Read Gary Taubes \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" or the distinquished works of Dr. Mary Enig.  T. Colin Campbell has used this review process to further his own agenda and has encouraged his minions to post here.  They disparage the book as well as mouth urban legend lies about Dr. Robert Atkins (a cardiologist, BTW).  Anyway, read the book and make your own conclusions.  Don't be led astray by these agenda-led and untrue attacks.  This 65 year old feels 20-30 years younger!!his own agenda and has encouraged his minions to post here.

B0000DZTIW|5.0|As with his works on Pearl Harbor and the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies, Hans Zimmer has successfully crafted yet another beautiful and engaging score. All of the tracks on the CD convey his soundtrack-crafting expertise and help produce both a great style of music for a movie and an excellent brand of music that can be enjoyed by anyone as something to relax, meditate, or enjoy tranquility with.  This soundtrack is living proof that Herr Zimmer's movie score career is prolific and worthy of commendation. Definitely worth purchasing if you're interested in listening to something that goes well with a wide range of emotions.
0061373877|5.0|Mr. Gaiman can read to me anytime. His voice is soothing, rich and full of expression. It is wonderful to have an author read his work, because he knows just where all the inflections should be. As for the story of Neverwhere, it is delightful and imaginative. Very hard to stop listening, because you never want to leave the story.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|I don't own this great show on dvd , yet! But soon I will. The show is awesome, I can't get enough of this action packed series. All the good points of the movie have already been said by other reviewers. I have not missed a new episode since it's debut on Starz. It's just so interesting. I expect the release on dvd will be good. 5 stars plus+++++ on Spartacus:Blood and Sand.
B002NOAF9W|1.0|If you don't own a copy of this already then maybe. But otherwise this is a total ripoff for the price.  The DVD is 5 minutes of Charlie standing in the rain.
0812979656|2.0|It was very difficult to keep track of the characters and their relationships.  If it weren't I had to finish it for a book club discussion I would have stopped reading it. Even though the story is compelling I found the writing style annoyingly and unnecessarily confusing.
B0013N3MV2|5.0|This is the second book in the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. This was a great book. I highly recommend it and the  others that I have read in the series. It gives some insight into the culture and life of people in Botswanna, Africa. I find it hard to fathom that this series was written by a man. He has great insight into the life of a Botswannan woman. The cases that she takes on as a detective are very interesting and enlightening.  This is a great series...I love it.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|If I would be requested what has been my favorite and personal cult movie of this talented director, I would pronounce myself for this superb although many times overlooked movie. Probably, no other film has blended with such accuracy, the Amercian gangster genre with the traditional Japanese Samurai. Besides we should wait for two films of the Nineties visibly inspired for this one: Ridley Scott's Black rain and Phil Kaufman's Raising sun.<br /><br />When Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) is aware that a friend's daughter has been kidnapped and held for ransom, he decides to join forces with a well known Japanese contact.<br /><br />The rest runs for you in this intriguing web of suspense and explosive action.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Love the books and love that it isn't cookie cutter Fantasy. Just hope this doesn't turn into another series like The Wheel of Time and going 20 years to finish. Come out with the next book or two for this series already!!!
B000002RXS|2.0|She waited to record this role until her french was good enough ( or so she said).  She was also worried that critics would complain she'd lost her top notes.  Shame she worried so much about what others thought as this recording came way too late in her career.  The noticeable break in her register makes it sound as if two women are portraying the lead role, and she's curiously cool in temperament for such a role.  She is at a disadvantage not having performed the role on stage, although Leontyne Price overcame that obstacle in her recording with Von Karajan.  Pretre's conducting is unremarkable which leaves us to marvel at the beautiful Don Jose of Nicolai Gedda.  But he's heard to better advantage on Beecham's recording with De Los Angeles.  Her interpretation though a bit cool itself, still makes me hear her as an intelligent but tragic and temperamental woman.  The recording is clear and bright but a bit distorted in climaxes. I'm no fan of Callas but I respect and admire her work and enjoy several of her recordings.  This however, is one I'm trading in.<br /><br />There are too many superior alternatives to recommend this recording.  Beecham/de los Angeles, Karajan/Price, Abbado/Berganza, Solti/Troyanos, and even Bernstein's most theatrical Met version with Horne and McCracken all offer much greater listening pleasure and sense of drama.
B00004X01U|4.0|It seems strange to say this but the the title track of this album is.....one TERRIFIC SONG! It's a great pop/funk-hip-hop type tune musically and one of the best produced of it's kind in that era but with a hook like \\"music makes the people come together\\" (plus the video-you remember) gives you to realize that Madonna hasn't lost her understanding of the music and most importantly the OVERRIDING MESSAGE behind funk since her days working with Nile Rodgers and her early aquintainship with David Byrne. This album had the odd place of following up [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]] which was where Madonna went from being primarily a singles act capable of delivering an occasional good album to a critics darling and a wizard in the 90's AOR electronica field. William Orbit again produces but when you here the title track you realize your getting something very different. Hi NRG type songs such as \\"Impressive Instant\\" and the elongated psychedelisized electronica of \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" look strongly to the flavors of the previous album. At the same time nothing about this is AOR-it's actually a more traditional Madonna album with a couple hit singles and other things. Lucky for her the \\"other things\\" are NOT filler. There's a lose concept running throughout this album. On almost alternative countryish numbers such as \\"I Deserve It\\",\\"Amazing\\" and \\"Gone\\" we suddenly find Madonna as something of a confessional singer-songwriter with a lot of world weariness and perhaps it would seem with the songs mildly downbeat nature,aggresive acoustic guitars and such her blockbuster Maverick singing Alanis Morrisette's own variety of music had rubbed off on the labels boss a little as these songs cut back a lot on Madonna's trademark stylized image. She would go even further down this road on the less popular follow up release [[ASIN:B00008S2VG American Life]]. \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" extends on the funk atmosphere again only on this occasion slickly done and with some nice touches of 70's sounding electric clavinet type keyboards. The other hit \\"Don't Tell Me\\" actually is a glue that mixes both the funky dance music and the singer-songwriter styles on this album with a bit of a stop-n-start British 2 step beat that was really popular at that time. Musically this album is assembled with a lot of abrupt musical jump cuts and doesn't flow together to the degree her previous release did. But much like David Bowie before her Madonna is a chameleon by nature and from her it's always best to expect the unexpected.done and with some nice touches of 70's sounding electric clavinet type keyboards.

B000I0QL82|5.0|Who can deny 1942 was a crucial year for the musical genre?. It should be said the very presence on stage of Yankee Doodle Dandy (directed by Michael Curtiz and James Cagney in one of his best performances ever) would be far enough to prove it. And in many ways eclipsed this little but delicious gem.<br /><br />Irving Berlin's wonderful music, the voice of Bing Crosby and the unforgettable Fred Astaire dancing is the best the money can buy. So, considering the possibilities, how can you fail with this magnificent and delightful movie?<br /><br />Wonderful all the way though. One of these films you will never get tired of watching it over and over again.
1400052173|4.0|This a story  about science and a family. Henrietta Lacks was a good mother and wife who died of cancer. Her cells contributed to scientific discoveries. Her family never benfitted from her contribution. The heart of this story is the story of her family after she died. Her children were neglected by their father and abused by their caretakers. The poverty continued after they were adults. The author spent years reaching out to the family in order to have them tell their story. S he finally gained their trust.The Lacks family is one of poverty, abuse, and lack of education.          Hopefully as a result of the publication of Henrietta's story her family will receive educational opportunities. I recommend this book.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I love the movie and hate the director. Smurfs are not all good, Marines are not all bad and tea partiers should not be shot in the streets for freedom of speech, James Cam-moron! You make awesome movies, stick to that, you suck at politics.
1439190275|5.0|I just finished reading the book last night.  The authors did a great job explaining the science behind Atkins.  I have done Atkins in the past as a \\"diet\\" and gained back weight because I did not make this my way of eating.  Everybody's metabolism is different and if you follow this way of eating and go through the phases as intentioned, one should learn which carbs they are sensitive to and the number of carbs they can eat daily without gaining weight.  This book is not about never eating carbs again but actually about introducing more healthy carbs into your life and finding the level of carbs your body can tolerate without gaining.  You will eat more whole foods and vegetables on this diet and drastically reduce or eliminate packaged/processed foods, which I believe is the culprit behind our weight problems in this counrty, with the amount of chemicals that are put in them.    For those claiming they are just trying to push their products, you are so wrong.  The book does not push the products and neither does the website.  They are there if you would like to purchase them.  Actually, the Atkins people are so sincere about trying to help you with this way of eating, they will actually steer you away from some of their products if that may be affecting your weight loss.      My husband started this with me on Feb 1st and at his Dr appt approx 6 wks after we started, his bp, cholesterol and triglycerides all showed significant improvement, especially his triglycerides which went from 539 6 mos. ago to 69.  I am convinced this is the best way of eating for life based on my own feeling of wellness, amount of energy I have and by reading all of the success stories from others on the Atkins forum.  Read the book and try it for a week or two to see what you're missing out on!

B0017KIBAI|2.0|I'm a (now retired) competitive Super Smash Bros. player, and I've played on dozens of iterations of the original Gamecube controller over the last several years. The primary differences between this white Nintendo Wii Classic Gamecube Controller is that it is supposed to boast a slightly better build quality and has a significantly longer cord. I've played on several of these types of controllers in the past as the hardcore competitive elite started to slowly set their eyes on this model (which was originally exclusive to [...]) back in 2008, and I was impressed with their quality. However, the two models that I had shipped and re-shipped to me had the same problem: I had been able to literally rub out the etched grooves in the rubber gripping of both controllers in under three hours of play. My friends and I own original Gamecube controllers from the day of the Gamecube's launch back in 2001, and that problem didn't even surface until literally four or five years into the lifespan of these controllers. I'm not exactly sure what it is about the two particular ones I tried out, but I decided to call it quits since it seemed like the problem was going to persist with the particular models being sold through Amazon.
0679735909|5.0|The purpose of a book review should not be to describe the characters and explain the plot, although that is what many reviews do.  You can get that information from Cliff's Notes, from someone else who has read the book, from the dust jacket or catalog description or any number of other sources.  The purpose of a book review - its reason for existing - is to aid you in deciding whether or not you should read the book.    You should read this book.    \\"Possession\\" is a masterpiece.  It's complex like a great red wine, brimming with ideas and themes - and surprises.  It's like a superbly good puff pastry: layers within layers within layers within layers.    This novel is a great many things all at once.  Here are a few:  it's a detective story, a love story (actually two love stories), a rumination on language and our relationship with it, an exploration of the concept of possession in widely varied aspects of life and thought, a historical novel within a novel, and a depiction of the world inhabited by professional academics that is only very, very slightly tongue in cheek.  Oh, and it contains some original poetry that is actually quite good.    This is writing by an author at the very peak of her craft.  The book is full of surprises, not merely in the plot but in the writing itself.  Byatt employs a technique of character development that I have seen used before, but always badly.  She uses it with skill and assurance.    You should read this book.  You might even want to consider buying a really nice copy, because you will want to return in six months or a year or two and read it again.

B002GYS1FO|5.0|Oh. My. Word. If I could have given this 10 stars, I would have. Here's how this love story started. I heard How You Like Me Now? on that car commercial with the sock monkeys and googled it. Found out it was The Heavy, listened to the samples on Amazon and bought it. Here's the middle of the love story. I listened to Love Like That 12 times today in my car. With this CD, you get everything. If you like Stevie Ray Vaughn, you'll hear him. If you like Led Zeppelin, you'll hear them. If you like the Kinks or the Beatles or Ozzy Osbourne, you'll find them in here too. Hell, you'll even hear something that sounds like the theme song from Gunsmoke or some old western. The diversity of this is like nothing I have ever experienced. And here's the best part. There is no end to this love story. It will go on and on as long as my CD player works.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is a very engaging movie that takes place in Northern UK.It is a BBC production and is a two disc set. If you are a history buff and like period pieces you will love this! Takes place in 19th century. The characters are two very strong willed people and puts one in mind of Pride and Prejudice. The original story was written by Elizabeth Gaskill, a relatively unkown but brilliant writer and contemporary with Dickens and Anthony Trollope. If you buy this title and enjoy it, I recommemend Wives and Daughters, by the same author and also a BBC production.
B000002U82|5.0|This is one of the most timeless of the groups albums and even today catapults you into serious reflection of who you are and what is expected of you. With the many mind-melding oddities Pink Floyd uses to the listeners advantage, there are messages in every song. Even without any words the instruments paint the visual perfectly. I hear crescendo-type harmony and melody that when listened to can actually play like a diary of a life gone by. Did you live the life you wanted in the time you had?<br /><br />Even if you don't enjoy Pink Floyd's strange catapultion into the not yet explored spaces of the imagination, this album with its nine complex songs will surely lend an account on what you might want to try should advantages run out. A very good album about reflection, one of my favorite that had me thinking about doing more. I especially like how mellow and close to home this one hits. For 42 minutes and 57 seconds this creates an aura where beautiful foreplay, curling up in front of the fire and just playing out what the song is about--a majick spell will keep you two growing older together day by day as time sometimes stands still.<br /><br />As soon as the `tolling of the iron bell' is struck, we listeners are effervescently thrown into a passionate embrace with that sexy songstress, Clare Torry; who even in slight shrill screaming can bring you to your knees as you are reaching for \\"That Great Gig In The Sky\\" cut #4. Running for a total of 4 minutes and 44 seconds you are ascending with the passion she and Wright exude an affair of the greater good with music and harmony and clearly lyrical appreciation of what some refer to as `God'. This is my ultimate favorite cut on the album.<br /><br />I am not sure if \\"The Great Gig in The Sky\\" has any real religious value, but as a spiritualist like me, I see a very abstract connection. I am hoping this lifts you to higher ground and catapults you past the ego restraints Floyd so passionately eluded ! I highly recommend this to any Floyd fan.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and<br /><br />Enjoy !n.    Thank you for reading and     Enjoy !
0767812166|5.0|Starman is one of my favorite movies of all time. Jeff Bridges does an incredible job as a benevolent alien and Karen Allen is great too. This movie was made in the 80s but it is timeless. Very romantic and has some meaningful messages about our culture. Highly recommended!

0385737424|5.0|Newbery committee surely got this one right!  What a gem!  Miranda is a most enjoyable character with a most age-accurate `voice'.  The supporting characters are also strong, her friends, her mother, the boyfriend of her mother, the loony guy on the corner, and even some of her schoolmates who seem considerably short of charming on first meeting.  The story is wonderfully well constructed, with one story line being her mother's training to be on the old game show $20,000 Pyramid and another being her ongoing adolescent discovery of relationships with friends.  But the mystery of sorts, cryptic notes that Amanda receives in unexplainable ways, and how that conundrum is resolved, are what really make this stand out.  Newbery winners are consistently well written, but some, like Holes and Walk Two Moons share the quality of a truly special ending like When You Reach me has.  I plan on loaning mine soon to that pretty mature, solid reading fifth grader, but a middle schooler, especially one who has read A Wrinkle in Time, to which this book refers, would enjoy it immensely.  I did.

I'm a total Matt Damon fan and while I wanted to see this back when it came out, it was because I thought the trailer looked really interesting.  Sadly, the trailer showed all the good parts, even when they weren't too great.  The trailer made the movie seem exciting, even though it wasn't.<br /><br />The movie was borderline comical, so unless thats what they meant...but I thought it was supposed to be kinda suspenseful.  The props and costumes were ridiculous.  Unlike.
014241039X|5.0|I love the outrageousness of Roald Dahl's books.  He refuses to follow the predictable formulas of children literature, and each turn of the page brings something surprising, strange or head-scratching.     \\"The Twits\\" is no exception. Dahl start us off with two utterly dislikeable main characters who play mean tricks on each other and are cruel to animals. Should we laugh - or be disgusted? Sometimes it's hard to know. The second half of the book involves an elaborate over-the-top plot by the animals to get revenge on the Twits.     It's a crazy and strange book - and a lot of fun.

B00006ADD5|4.0|Peter O'Toole has spent the last 28 years wasting his talent in totally mediocre films not up to his gift as an actor. He's been in a total of maybe TWO films that had any kind of patina of class at ALL, (\\"My Favorite Year\\" and \\"The Last Emperor\\", the latter by the repugnant Bernardo Bertolucci,) the rest have been totally missable pieces of fluff or outright stinkers. But THIS film is what started it for him... a run of more than twenty years of some of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />I am a big fan of that O'Toole, the O'Toole that starred ONLY in exceptional films, like \\"The Lion In Winter\\", \\"What's New Pussycat\\", \\"The Ruling Class\\", \\"Great Catharine\\", etc., and revisiting this film makes it all obvious why. Like I've said before, O'Toole is one of the two \\"crown princes of intense\\", the other being Richard Burton, and he gives us a good preview of his style here.<br /><br />This is the story of Thomas Edward Lawrence, (who O'Toole resembles not one whit,) the British officer who helped the Arabs liberate themselves from Turkish rule. It shows the stoicness of spirit and the fiery resolve Lawrence had to bring  off his goal successfully. It shows the devotion the Arabs he befriended had for him. Lawrence BECAME an Arab to lead these men, who had become moribund, thinking that their cause was hopeless.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer and Omar Sharif, (in what was also HIS first movie,) acquit themselves decently as Turkish and Arab chieftains and bigwigs, with Guinness portraying a rather unconvincing King Feisal, and Quinn sporting the most OBVIOUS prosthetic nose I've ever seen in the movies.<br /><br />This film wrote the book on grand scale and scope as it displays scene after scene of confrontations both mano a mano and battles with a cast of thousands, all of it brought off very realistically. The cinematography is excellent, the art direction realistic, (this was one of the first \\"dirt-under-the-fingernails\\" period movies to be shown, along with \\"Taras Bulba\\", both in the early sixties,) and the acting almost perfect! If you want to see one of the last of the great epic films, (for this surely WAS one of the last to actually MEAN anything,) rent or buy this great film, the first big film for O'Toole and the VERY first international film for Omar Sharif!<br /><br />Highly recommended!, both in the early sixties,) and the acting almost perfect!

It is sad, yet full of love.  It is historical fiction but has so much truth. It has a little bit of \\"Kurt Vonnegut\\" style commentary here and there.  It is told from the point of view of Death, but it makes death more bearable and less dreadful.  Thank you Markus Zusak for writing this work of art, this work of love.  You have given such a gift by writing this book.

Well because it was so cool I felt it was already worth the great $9.99 price and I wanted to watch the whole thing in blu ray format.The DVD looked good so I knew the Blu Ray wold shine and it dose.<br /><br />Most of the movie is dark and dreary and felt much like a Blade Runner as far as the filming.The actual movie still felt like what The Matrix should have been.By that I mean I hate the Matrix but the idea for that movie was great just not pulled off well with the over the top action and well Keanu.It pulls off what it is trying to do none of it is over the top.Even the final fight witch a lot of people wanted to be much more action pact stayed the course.(Spoiler)Having the older leader who was visually weaker then I'm shore he was when he was younger and had far more control of his abilities and a man trying to learn to control and even find the limits of his newly found abilities in a battle.There was no flipping and flying Yoda stile cheese.It was just a power struggle who had the most.<br /><br />All the actors did a fine job as well as the backdrop of the city and the stile in witch it was filmed.I mentioned it was dark a lot of the time in the movie and in most cases that leads to some graininess on DVDs but the black is pitch black as it should be on Blu Ray.A great WTF is going on movie that doesn't sell out for fear of people not sticking with it.The clues are all there and placed at a good pace up to the reveal.I loved this movie.It received 4 stars from me.I find it hard to give a 5 star to any movie but this one was close.If you like sci fi and a good ride.Take this trip!
B00127RAJY|5.0|What a workout! I've been using this dvd, rotating it with a few others, for almost a year now and it still makes me sweat. Each workout is only 20-25 minutes, but it's definitely a workout. As you progress towards Level 3, the workouts incorporate more movement into each exercise. Where in Level 1 you would be in a lunge position and just move your arms, in Level 3 you would be doing lunges AND arm movements at the same time, so you're using more muscles and working the core. I'm not completely sold on the 3-2-1 method, but it does give the workout a nice variation. It didn't take long to conquer Level 1, but now I rotate between Levels 2 and 3 and have increased the weights I use from 3lb to 5lb and am very happy with the results. Since it's only 20-25 minutes, I'll usually combine this workout with something else (running, Wii Fit, or another dvd that focuses on one area).
0060935464|4.0|This book comes with such a reputation behind it that it seems a bit of a sin to criticise, but really folks, it lacks the tight structure needed to put it among the truly great.<br /><br />It's basically a series of charming sketches of small-town America before the modern world got its hold, given some sort of shape by the arrest, trial and conviction of an innocent man.<br /><br />Once the main plot is over and done, Harper Lee seems not to know where to go, and the book drifts rather aimlessly to its close.<br /><br />Wonderful, touching description of people and place, however, with Atticus Finch one of those quiet heroes who makes you feel the world is a better place just for having read about him.

B000VMFDW2|4.0|Why should you buy another book about World War II? The genre is chock-full of bad writing, poor research, and sanctimonious historical drivel about what a wonderful, perfect, unambiguous, justifiable war it was that made the world safe for democracy. Moreover, at first glance, \\"With the Old Breed\\" looks like it's going to be another rally-round-the-flag memoir trumpeting the victory of the righteous white man over the imperialistic Japanese devils.<br /><br />As one of the books upon which HBO based its series, \\"The Pacific,\\" this book merits reading--absolutely--if you're also watching the series and want to get some background on the characters involved in the television production.<br /><br />By the end of page one, your skepticism and reluctance at reading another WWII memoir should be completely dispelled. This is a beautiful, terrible, moving, sad, and gentle account of why no war is ever right, or ever justifiable, or ever worth the cost, and its author speaks from the first person of having been forced to do the slaughtering with his own hands.<br /><br />The power of this book resonates on many levels. First, Sledge simply refuses to analyze the big picture. No ponderous thoughts about Japanese world hegemony or the perfidy of Pearl Harbor, no snapshots on what was strategically at stake if the U.S. had lost the Pacific...just a step-by-step slog through the madness of carnage and murder. Sledge begins with the bright and familiar stories of volunteering, going through boot camp, and then shipping out. You are gradually brutalized with each passing phase, as was he.<br /><br />A second source of the book's power is the way Sledge takes readers from boot camp to the final victory on Okinawa. He literally walks you through the slog of an infantryman in the Marine Corps. No detail is too insignificant, because these details reveal the awfulness of killing people. And although combat junkies will revel in the \\"real\\" battlefield depictions of rotting flesh, maggots, and enemy soldiers blown to bits, those interested in the human descent into what Sledge calls \\"the meatgrinder\\" will find far more of interest in the non-combat stories that Sledge peppers throughout the book.<br /><br />He pokes fun at a new commander who brags about what he'll do under fire, only to wilt in terror at the first shelling. He writes with profound sadness at the death of his friends and, most movingly, at the pointless death of the Japanese. He remembers two marines getting into a fistfight over a range card with a woman's lipstick on it, and reminisces about the kindness of navy Seabees who let tired and hungry marines eat in their hot chow line. For a man who has been permanently disturbed by his experiences in combat, Sledge's basic kindness and warmth fill this book as he notes examples of friendship, kindness, heroism, and above all, humanity in the most depraved environment imaginable.<br /><br />Sledge would be a war hero if he believed in war heroes, which he clearly does not. What's most interesting about the title is that the \\"Old Breed\\" were the marines of legend, men with whom Sledge felt honored to have served. Yet he never seems to recognize that he is the epitome of the Old Breed: courageous, professional, selfless, tough, and dedicated to the job of efficiently killing people. His modesty is astonishing.<br /><br />Also moving in this book is his constant attention to and remembrance of the terror and fear of combat, mixed in with the exhaustion and drudgery of being in the infantry. The mud, the rain, the heat, the backbreaking labor carrying ammo and supplies, the open sores, the rocky coral surface: all of these details make the toughness and brutality of the job something that a reader can imagine. He captures in far fewer words, but with equal force, Norman Mailer's terrible journey carrying casualties back to safety in [[ASIN:B0012U98D2 The Naked and the Dead]] Sledge repeatedly singles out the corpsmen and fellow marineswho had to repeatedly face enemy fire as they went out onto the battlefield to retrieve their dead and wounded, often becoming casualties themselves.<br /><br />Unlike Paul Fussell's [[ASIN:0345361350 Thank God for the Atom Bomb]] Sledge's memoir, to the extent that it justifies the Pacific war at all, does so obliquely and gently. If you can read through this carnage and terror and waste, and consider that the waste was many times greater on the Japanese side, you will reach what I think is a fair conclusion: the Japanese were wrong to murder so many of their own in such a pointless war.<br /><br />Finally, despite his use of words like \\"goddamned\\" and \\"ass\\" when he reconstructs marine conversations, Sledge is very southernly gentlemanly in his writing demeanor. No crudity, and a notable absence of the real profanity used by soldiers and marines underscore the strong notions of politeness that emanate from his upbringing as the son of a well-to-do physician in Alabama. When I first read this book fifteen years ago, I was moved by it. After re-reading it on my Kindle, if anything, I'm even more moved today.

0446580945|4.0|This book is about a boy named John who's troubled past has helped him make the decision to join the army. While he is on leave and back at home, he meets a girl names Savannah who is there for the summer building houses. There's an instant connection between the two and after awhile they start dating. The story is about the struggle to keep their relationship alive while John is away at war and Savannah is back in her hometown going to college.     One element I liked about the book was the plot. There was never really a dull moment because John and Savannah's love for each other was so strong that it just made you want to keep reading.   Another element is the point-of-view. The whole story is written through John's point-of-view. I liked that because he talked about the way thing were as he was at war and it put a better picture in my mind of how things really are in Iraq.  A third element is the internal conflict John had. After he was done serving his part in the army he had the option to sign up again or to leave and be able to spend time with Savannah. He doesn't know which one to choose because he doesn't feel he has done all he can to help our country, but he can feel the strain being put on his relationship because of all the time he's away.    I really liked this book because although at parts it was a typical love story, there were parts that made me want to keep on reading because I had no idea what was going to happen next. Every time I thought John was going to do something, he did the exact opposite.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|The Scorpions album we've all been waiting for. I've only heard the first 2 tracks and it's the Scorpions the way I like them. Rockin and big hooks. I was a huge fan of the 80's Scorpions and I love Judas Priest too but If I had a choice IT'S THE SCORPIONS! It's what April Wine should have done after Nature of the Beast, make the next one the way we want to hear it. Don't change it up! Give us what we want. Be true to who you are. We've had glimpses of what the Scorpions were with some of the following albums through the years but this is the one we've been waiting for. THANK YOU SCORPIONS! What an amazing live show too! So much energy. The punk rock band the Matches is the only other band I'VE seen live that could come close to the Scorpions. Both bands kicked my ass! We'll miss you and thank you.
0802798225|5.0|Loved this book. Though not an original storyline, it is a tried and true formula.  While the developing romance keeps you reading, it is really well rounded with the messages of acceptance, cultural diversity and stepping out for what you believe in.  Alex and Brittany may be the stereotypical gang member and cheerleader but they are very well developed and believable characters.  I love how the author explores the facades that many people work so hard to keep up and how letting them fall can be the best thing sometimes.    Again, great read.  This book moves along smoothly with short chapters alternating between Brittany's and Alex's perspectives. Draws you in quickly and hard to put down. As a mom with a 12 year old daughter, I would recommend it for older teens as there is some bad language (English and Spanish - not gratuitous but authentic to the gang characters), some gang violence and frequent sexual references.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|I've seen this movie many times and in several ways.  I suggest seeing it in the original Swedish with the theatrical subtitles only.  Amazon still hadn't clarified the availability of the version I wanted, so I finally bought it elsewhere.  Go to the Target website ([...]), search the title.  There will be three results (as of this writing).  You can click an icon for more details or just click the \\"Find it at a Target store\\" button. A small window will open and just type your zipcode or city/state.  A list of stores near you will appear with the availabilty in each store.  It cost me $9.99 for the theatrical subtitle version.

Of course it's a great great story, but the audiobook really does it justice.  The audio quality is top-notch, and the reader (Molina) does a superb job.  He does a great job separating out all the various characters, and even more impressive, he really does well with that old-English/pirate language.  Believe me, this is one of the very best audiobooks you can buy.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I turn to this soundtrack album to moderate my withdrawal from seeing the movie (more times than I care to admit). The very first thing which surprises me is how well the soundtrack stands on its own. While I watched the movie, it seemed that the music was pushed to the background by the stunning 3-D visuals, and that the score was done in almost total service to the action on the screen.<br /><br />My first sense that there was more here than met the eye was when I saw a portion performed during the Oscar presentations. My word, I didn't realize it was so good! I was doubly impressed when I read that Horner composed the score on two levels. The basic level was composed using lots of African instruments, rythms, and vocals. The overlay was classic Hollywood action movie 'Sturn und Drang'. The two don't often overlay exactly, but when they do, especially during the final battle scene, the impact is visceral. There is an even better transition from the opening arial sweep over the Pandoran forest with African themes, juxtaposed to Jake's arrival in the the interstellar ship done to very percussive Carl Orff flavored themes.<br /><br />My next touchstone was to compare this score to that of Lord of the Rings (all three movies) by Howard Shore, which won the Oscar for 'Return of the King'. As much as I love everything about LOTR, I confess that Horner's score, which did not win, for 'Avatar' is more interesting than Shore's. This is after a half dozen listenings of Horner, compared to hundreds of Shore's CDs.<br /><br />My only reservations about this CD is that pieces appear on the CD in a different order than in the film. It's not too bad, since it's only in the middle. I also miss the great musical accompaniment to the reveal of the AVATAR title at the end, but that's a minor point. On the plus side, this sounds very much like a different mix, or even a different performance than what is on the movie soundtrack itself. The differences are subtle, but several of the passages just seem a lot crisper and brighter. Maybe when the movie sound was mixed, the music became a bit muted.<br /><br />This is an very nice evocation of the film for us fanatics, until the DVD comes out!crisper and brighter.

B0036XN2L2|2.0|So this is it. Or maybe that should read \\"so this is it?\\" The last Scorpions studio CD hit the stores in the USA this past Tuesday and what are we to make of it? Is it great? No. Is it terrible? Absolutely not. It is sadly, a fair representation of where they are today. Done.     It must be incredibly difficult to desire artistic license but be trapped and pigeon holed by one's own successful formula. When this is the case there is no artistic progression, just essentially a re-writing and a re-working and a re-issuing of what has worked before. This creates staleness, and a paint by numbers approach. A bands sound is then dictated by what the fans demand or what the fans will accept. However, in the case of the Scorps, the fans are no longer ranging in age from 14 to 21. There are no 14 year old Scorpions fans today. There are no 25 year old Scorpion fans today. I'd have the odds on my side by venturing that perhaps there are but a meager handful of 30 year old Scorpion fans today. Perhaps one or two 25 or 30 year old's remember seeing  mom or dad's old Scorpions albums with kinky cover art, but that's it.     Their history spans nearly 40 years and their career can be broken into three chapters. Chapter 1 spanned the years 1972 - 1979, this was probably their most unique and \\"true to themselves\\" period. A hungry band with their own sound; one of the world's great guitar players in Uli Jon Roth and no label support, these were the RCA years and Fly to The Rainbow (1974) In Trance (1975), Virgin Killer (1976) Taken By Force (1977) and concluding with the incredible double live Tokyo Tapes (1978) showed the band a serious force to be reckoned with. Chapter 2 is the period from 1979 through 1988, which saw them become one of the planet's most successful groups, interestingly all the while being produced by Dieter Dierks. With the great Mathias Jabs now shredding for them, the Scorpion sound changed; in some respects became more \\"Americanized\\", but they penned nary a duff track for virtually the entire decade, and Lovedrive (1979), Animal Magnetism (1980), Blackout (1982), Love At First Sting (1984), Worldwide Live (1985) and concluding with Savage Amusement (1988) are all absolute killers and are definitive examples of the cream of the  crop of the great 1980's metal movement which dominated the music world at the time. Chapter 3 began in 1990 and spans till the present. This was a period of time which saw them record their biggest hit, \\"Wind of Change\\" from the  \\"Crazy World\\" CD. They become in a sense \\"global ambassadors\\" for music and peace, and at the same time shifted their focus to South America, Asia and Eastern Europe. \\"Face the Heat\\" (1993) was followed by \\"Pure Instinct\\" (1996) They brought in outside writers and changed bass players twice and drummers once during this time; they also changed producers on every studio record during that time span. Album sales began to decline; a series of \\"Greatest Hit's and \\"Best Of\\" packages were released, followed by the bad experiment called Eye II Eye (1999), the orchestral CD (2000) and the acoustic CD (2001), both of which were very good. A return to form took place in 2004 with the terrific \\"Unbreakable\\" and the very decent \\"Humanity Hour 1\\" (2007).     A couple months ago the Scorps announced that \\"Sting In The Tail\\" would be their final studio CD. They also said the creative juices were flowing at their peak and the new CD would be a very special farewell.     That's the problem. It's not special at all. The best songs on \\"Sting In the Tail\\" would be the worst song on so many of their previous albums. The CD kicks off in energetic fashion with \\"Raised On Rock\\", which is text book Scorpions, including the signature underlying guitar melody line. But where is the guitar break? Where is the screaming Mathias Jabs solo? It's just not there. We are only treated to a lead as the song fades out. Why have the Scorpions either buried Mathias in the mix or chosen to minimize the lead breaks for the last 15 years? His lead work from \\"Blackout\\" through \\"Savage Amusement\\" was nothing short of astounding, at times soloing throughout the songs, and helping to define their sound and his place in the upper echelon of great players. The title track begins with some weird voice box effects of Klaus saying something stupid like \\"bang bang, rock with the gang\\". The tune is ok, but.......you guessed it, no lead break. Up next is \\"Slave Me\\" a mid tempo sexy tale and finally we are treated to a lead break but a forgetful one which last for only about 8 measures. \\"The Good Die Young\\" features Klaus speaking/singing in a low octave. It's a fairly dramatic tune, not extremely heavy and with minimal lead break. \\"No Limits\\" is an up tempo tune with the positive message and again a minimal lead break. \\"Rock Zone\\" is the 2010 version of \\"Now\\" from 1982. But Klaus was 34 in 1982 and he's 62 now, and penning such non memorable phrases as \\"you're not alone in the Rock Zone\\". \\"Lorelei\\" is a beautiful ballad with a great vocal melody line and a Rudy Schenker solo, melodic but short...again. \\"Turn You On\\" is a really good Scorps song. It moves and it grooves. Nothing too deep here, but the underlying guitar melody line is just so catchy. Right after Klaus yells \\"I wanna turn you on\\", we are treated to the competent 4 measure Mathias solo. \\"Sly\\" is another ballad with great Klaus vocals and this is another example of how the Scorps have changed. They used to be the kings of the power ballad. While both \\"Sly\\" and \\"The Good Die Young\\" are ballads, they are not powerful. \\"The Spirit of Rock\\" is an extremely catchy radio friendly tune which could be a single but won't be. The lead solo is longer than 4 measures but it is forgettable. The final tune is a nice uplifting melody called \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\". Klaus Meine sounds fantastic throughout the album, as he always does. The years have taken nothing away from his voice. It seems to be as strong now as in 1982. Bassist Pawel Maciwoda and drummer James Kottak add much to the band; studio-wise they are up high in the mix, and are better, more imaginative players then their predecessors, Francis Bucholtz and Herman Rarebell, especially live, as they spice up older songs with a slightly more modern feel. The production is excellent, though for their final album I wonder if they considered Dieter Dierks. Perhaps he could have brought back some of the magic. Lyrically, I am disappointed as the Scorpions always penned clever, nasty, kinky lyrics (Blackout, Rock you like A Hurricane, Dynamite) and the lyrics on this CD seem trite.  Additionally, the selection of songs leaves me wondering if they really sought to do something special for this record. None of the songs on \\"Sting in the Tail\\" are classics and they did write classics as recently as 2004 with \\"Deep and Dark\\", \\"Through My Eyes\\" and \\"Love `em or Leave `em\\" The new songs are all just decent catchy, albeit forgettable tunes. On every CD going back to at least \\"Love at First Sting in 1984 they have had at least one tune with a social statement (\\"Media Overkill\\", \\"Under the Same Sun\\", \\"Wind of Change\\"), but not on \\"Sting In The Tail\\". Why not?  They could have re-recorded some of their 1970's classics in a medley. They could have created a 3 CD retrospective with all phases of their career represented and recorded with a modern sound. The bands \\"sense of self\\" seems to be missing, and I know I'm possibly over analyzing, but that is what a scribe is supposed to do. Since I truly have loved this band for 30 years and being as familiar with everything they have ever recorded and performed as I am, I wanted their last studio CD to be a celebration of who they are, who they were and what they meant to heavy metal, hard rock, and rock `n' roll in general. Unfortunately, that does not come across on \\"Sting In the Tail\\".

0061564893|1.0|The only valid reviews possible for this book must be done by academics who spend their professional lives delving into the primary sources cited in a history book.    This book is fantasy history.  It takes a true historical set of events, well-documented in and of themselves, and then extends it into fantasy using 'sources' that have been found, if you do your investigation like a number of academics have, to be either complete misinterpretations or unsubstantiating evidence.    Mr. Menzies is not a serious historian.  He is either deluded or paid to spread delusions.  That so many others have followed in spreading this dishonest and intellectually offensive as history is both an insult to historians and probably also a sorry reminder that the general public will eat anything as long as it is sweet and exotic.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is a mocumentary show (in a similar style to [[ASIN:B0009VBTP0 The Office - Season One]] or [[ASIN:B0010YVC9I Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Seasons 1-6]]) created by Christopher Lloyd ([[ASIN:B000VDDE18 Frasier - Complete Series]]) and Steven Levitan ([[ASIN:B0001Z3I0S Just Shoot Me - Seasons One and Two]]) and it follows the families of Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill), his daughter Claire Dunphy (Julie Bowen), and his son Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) who all live in Los Angeles. Claire is a homemaker mom in a traditional family, married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell); they have three children. Jay is married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sofía Vergara), and is raising a pre-teen stepson. Mitchell and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) are a gay couple who have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily. The families meet for family functions, around the neighborhood, and cross-family bonding.     I caught this show on the off-chance (luckily it was the pilot too) and was instantly hooked - it is hilarious! As well as being side-splittingly funny, the show is also very realistic with everyday scenarios that could (and do) happen to anyone and everyone. The chemistry and interaction between the actors' characters is spot-on and feels very genuine, so I truly admire how well each and every one of the cast perform in this fantastic new show. Each episode also revolves around a theme - whether it be fear, lying, Christmas etc, so never gets boring or short of variety. Thankfully it has been renewed for at least a second season so there's plenty more to come and I sincerely look forward to seeing where this show goes in the future. I highly recommend giving this a watch - this is definitely the best and most clever comedy series I have seen in a long time.

1439190275|5.0|Having read the 2002 version of Atkins, I was especially thrilled with the new book's easy to read and follow advice.  Lots of updated information.  The chapters on fats (covering the different types of dietary fats that we need), inflammation and CRP are extremely helpful.<br /><br />A wonderful feature of the new book is pages of suggested menus broken down by phase and carb increments.  The advice for vegetarians and vegans (complete with pages of sample menus) was outstanding.  In the past it was difficult for vegheads to follow Atkins...now it is outlined with simple, whole food choices that are attractive for even those who wish to occasionally eat meat-free.  The new book really IS a new Atkins for a new you!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebellum's  album \\"Need you Now\\"  contains some very fine music.  Enjoyable listening.  Loved it.

0802798225|5.0|Brittany Ellis for all intents an purposes is perfect.  Well to those who see her on the outside.  She's pretty, she's got the blue eyes, the blonde hair, the perfect body, and a hot boyfriend everything a high school senior could want.  But all this is going to change when the chemistry teacher decides to pair up students, rather than allow them to pick their own partners.<br />Alex Fuentes is a gangbanger, he's got tattoos, he carries weapons and he does certain jobs that most people would call criminal.  And he is now partnered up with the hottest girl in chemistry.  She's afraid of him, he doesn't care for her, so what it there to do but start falling for each other.<br /><br />Yes, this book is Romeo and Juliet-esque, West Side Story-esque, Beauty and the Beast.  But I found more depth to it.<br /><br />Brittany has a controlling mother who wants Brit to be perfect because her older sister, Shelly isn't.  Shelly was born with Cerebral Palsy and is the Ellis' family failure.  But Brittany adores her older sister, is able to communicate with her and play checkers with her.  Mom would rather send her away to a nursing home so that she is out of sight.  A way to pretend that she never happened.  Nice mom.  Brittany also shields what people see inside of her house, so not many people know about Shelly.  To them, Brit lives a normal life.<br /><br />Alex is the main male figure in his family and will do anything to make sure that his two younger brothers and his single mom are safe.  Even if it means his life to do it.  His path is not to cross with Ms. Ellis, and it's certainly not to develop feelings.<br /><br />My only issue with this book was that Ms. Elkeles included a dare that Alex would eventually make love to Brittany.  I understand the plot device, but as their feelings for each other grew, I found that device would be used to pry them apart and it did.  But not in a way you would think it would've.<br /><br />I really liked Alex a lot.  For all his faults, he was really a good guy and we get to see that early on.  The introductions in chemistry class by Alex/Brittany is hysterical and I really laughed out loud.  There was some typical typecasting of the best friends, frenemies, hot boyfriend, who went away for summer and got laid.<br /><br />It also addressed, that the grass isn't always greener in the other yard.  Brittany really struggles with her parents and their need for her to look pitch perfect.  Brittany's life was just as messed up as Alex's was, but in a different way.<br /><br />Each chapter is told in the POV of either Brittany or Alex, so you really get a sense of what they are struggling with and how their feelings evolve.  It makes life easier than if it was in third person and you just base the feelings on what is being said or done.<br /><br />This story does end on a happy note and the epilogue was kind of heavy-handed, but it was what it was.  I still enjoyed the story, even if it was a tale as old as time.  I still think it deserves the 5 bookmarks I gave it.<br /><br />The second book in the series RULES OF ATTRACTION, comes out on April 13, 2010.  Perhaps a birthday present for myself!to see that early on.  The introductions in chemistry class by Alex/Brittany is hysterical and I really laughed out loud.

B0034JKZ86|1.0|I thought the idea of animating the princess and the frog was a clever idea, but the execution left a lot to be desired.  This was hardly a child's movie with truly scary villanous shadows.  Normally, Disney does a remarkable job with their musical animated films, but this one left me flat.  Their music was not up to their normal standards, and jazz. . .  Well, let's just say I don't like jazz and leave it at that.  The prince came across as effeminent and a lazy bum.  What hard working woman would really fall in love with that type?  And he came across as a womanizer.  Again, a loser.  Our heroine was everything we could wish for.  She was short changed with this prince charming.  I did like the alligator and the witch of the swamp.
B001U7FWM8|3.0|from myBlog [...]<br />...When I first played this album, only two tracks grabbed me. Those two tracks still remain the standouts on this album, but I grew to love the laid back vibe and beautiful harmonies and melodies this group has put together on their third album which was released last summer. The albums first single (and now featured in a Volkswagen commercial) \\"Two Weeks\\" is a light, upbeat and a great showcase for all 4 band members talents. \\"Ready, Able\\" is a slower, moodier song that blends perfectly with the vibe of the album -- which is very moody, but also very relaxing and also very Earthy (I suppose this is what you might call Contemporary Folk music). Those two benefit from very strong hooks and melodies, but the entire album with their very textured harmonies is a great listen, a great example of a band that blend together perfectly.
0790733226|5.0|What's not to like about a film with so much passion?  Seeing the Deep Space Array is always a treat (try 2010) and SETI has been my favorite government program since Starman.
B002MXA7TC|3.0|from myBlog [...]... (check it out!)<br /><br />This groups break out single \\"Sweet Disposition\\" grabbed me when I heard it on the radio, but like Grizzly Bear I wasn't bowled over the first time I listened to the album. And that amazing single is still the only real standout to be honest. The powerful and unique vocals and vocal delivery of Dougie Mandagi, matched with the upbeat instrumentation and strong hook make this one of the better songs I've heard in a while. Unfortunately it seems like the group couldn't match the greatness of this song with anything else on the album. However, if you like that song (and I love it) the rest of the album isn't a big disappointment. It's very much in the same vein of that song, power hooks over very polished electronic/rock beats. \\"Soldier On\\" shows a lot more restraint than most of the tracks, with a soft guitar backing and very great delivery by the lead vocalist it also stands out a little more than the rest. However, this is their first studio album. So I think this group has amazing potential to be pretty big in the years to come, if they keep in the same direction as \\"Sweet Disposition\\"
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN THAT THIS MOVIE WAS FINALLY GOING TO BE COMING OUT SINCE HAVING BEEN A FAN SINCE THE BEGINING OF WHAT IS NOW THE CULT OF FOLLOWERS BELONGING TO THAT HOMMAGE TO JUSTICE KNOWN AS THE BOONDOCK SAINTS.  I FINALLY HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH IT LAST NIGHT AFTER HEARING MIXED REVIEWS FROM SEVERAL FRIENDS, SOME THOUGHT IT AWESOME AND SOME THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE, AND AFTER WATCHING A MERE 18 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE LATTER GROUP. THIS MOVIE WAS INSULTING, DEMEANING AND PITTIFUL!!! IT TOOK ALL THE THINGS THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL SO GREAT AND TURNED INTO A POSER'S DELIGHT. I COULDN'T BE MORE DISAPOINTED AND AM NOW DETERMINED TO PRETEND THAT I NEVER EVEN SAW THOSE 18 MINUTES AND ENJOY THE BOONDOCK SAINTS FOR WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE. NOT SOME CORNY KNOCK OFF OF WHAT HOLLYWOOD OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO BE MESSED WITH. I STRONGLY ADVISE ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO TRULY LOVES AND RESPECTS THE FIRST TO JUST LEAVE THE SECOND ONE ALONE AND TRUST ME ON THIS!! YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU DO!!
B0037AGASG|5.0|I love the album. Justin, did another great job. The album is great, for all ages. His vocals, are great, and so is he. The album will be Platinum I believe, in a very short time. Millions, around the world love you Justin, so don't worry about the few that don't!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album definitely carves a spin on the traditional Eurocentric Symbolisms of Dark, for Dark Side of the Moon is quite a beautiful, delicately balanced creation of peace and chaos. Be aware that this wonderful album will take you on a ride to the Dark Side if you let it, the way the instruments play is a precursor to meditation. The chaotic elements introduced- those of mundane objects like clocks and registers, create interesting, experimental cleavages (i.e., at once splicing and uniting), and precede two of my favorite songs in the album- Time and Money. I gotta tell you, though, prepare your soul for the soul wrenching 'Gig in the Sky' where a female voice moves up and down the sound scale with the facility of a warm knife through butter, taking you to extremes of euphorious highs and sexy lows.   CAUTION: THIS IS NOT AN ALBUM TO BE PLAYED ON RANDOM, it was masterpieced together from beginning to end, one song transitting onto the next. I recommend you take a long walk with your Discman and this baby in its womb down a quiet street, give yourself 50 minutes- From experience, my promise: This album will carry you... you will not feel that walk.
0765350386|5.0|BEWARE! Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn will keep you riveted to the point of no return. Once you begin your adventure with Vin and the other members of the criminal underworld of the Final Empire, you won't be able to stop. The book is well written and filled with intrigue. Each chapter causes you to ask more questions, wonder about people's pasts, and want to keep reading. This book has a little bit of something for everyone: action, mystical powers, an overthrow of the government, romance, and more. The novel discusses universal archetypal themes of good versus evil in a new, exciting way. You will travel the Final Empire with Vin, a young scavenger with Allomantic abilities (powers involving the digestion of metals to produce magical effects) she doesn't understand, as she is recruited by Kelsier for an elite team of cons and thieves. They work together, building up forces of resistance against the Lord Ruler, his Inquisitors, and the nobility. This Ocean's 11-like story will keep you tied to your seat as Vin and Kelsier attempt to plan a heist against the nobles of the city, in hopes of overthrowing the Lord Ruler and his minions to create a land free from oppression and filled with the bright hopes of a new day.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I am a true Sade fan and love her with all my heart.  However this has got to be her worst album ever.  I was eagerly awaiting this new release and couldn't wait to buy it.  Only to be overwhelmingly disappointed.  I can tolerate one song, and maybe not even that.  I'm used to her slow sad songs, but this cd just downright drags.  When I played it all I could think was \\"after all this time, doesn't she have SOMETHING she can sing happily about\\"?????    But I still love her,    weeping fan

B000002IRL|5.0|Best cd of Overkill the guitar sounds killer,the drums are speed, and the bass guitar is amazing , very goog cd,five stars if you like the trash buy this dont thing twice,
B0025KVLUG|2.0|A cute enough flick, but not much of an album, certainly not by Beatles standards. \\"Hey Bulldog\\" is the most interesting of the few new songs. The original l.p offered the first true stereo rendering of \\"All You Need is Love\\", but that no longer applies. And, George Martin, a true genuius of a producer, possessed little talent as a film score composer. Apart from the lovely \\"Pepperland\\", there's not much worth listening to in his contributions here. All in all, a pretty much expendable novelty from the Beatles catalogue. For completists only!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Well constructed, light-weight, comfortable, adjustable, plenty loud enough(even for a drummer)and a nice long cord.      Having used over the ear headphones nearly all my life for various applications, be it music, tv, practicing on the drums. I find it that over the ear headphones are the only way to truly get masterful sound. I don't care if you have a billion dollar sound system, you will never reach the level of sound intimacy that over the ear phones provide. And thats what makes these great.  Honestly, any over the ear will enhance your gaming/entertainment value, but with these, you get a mixer amp and a microphone to boot.  That's really all that sets these apart from any ole over the ear phones IMO. And it's enough to get a 5 star from me.      Had absolutley no problems hooking them up and the PS3 recognized them virtually instantly.  So, set-up is a breeze.    Some say that they are cheaply made, well, you pay for what you get, as is true with everything.  If you are like most people who work for your money and respect the things you earn money to buy, the construction is 5 star.    And, if the cord isn't long enough for you(About 16 feet). Simply buy rca extenders and a usb extender.     Well worth the money, if your thinking about buying them, STOP THINKING AND CLICK BUY!!!!!  You won't be disappointed.
B00000K0T8|4.0|This is a great album, Ghostface Killahs debut solo album, and his best.  I like all the tracks, up until the last 6, the album just falls apart for some reason, but my brother likes the whole album.    It has production from RZA at his best. The vocals are different from earlier Wu-tang albums, maybe due to different microphone and equipment.  Ghostface isnt on every song, and fellow group member have some of there most memorable verses on this album.  its barely a solo album due to all the guest appearances.    This is an awesome, awesome album, up until the last few tracks in my opinion, but you might like the whole thing.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Are you People serious about knocking this CD.A bunch of guys who some are pushing 60 Im sure, BLOWING AWAY ANY SO CALLED NEW TALENT.Its got everything a CD needs to have. For those who dont like it, PLEASE either take your ear plugs out or listen to it again.

1439190275|5.0|Recently started reading this book and was impressed with the up to date scientific information.  The doctors and experts really know their stuff.    I have been slowly and steadily loosing 1 to 2 pounds a week for the past 2 months - which is just what I needed to too.  I am very close to my goal wait and will soon be moving into the maintenance phase.  I really enjoy the recipes found on the Atkins website and can't wait to try some of the new ones in this book for commonly used items like ketchup, mayo, tartar sauce, etc.  Following this lifestyle makes eating healthy EASY!!!!    I also love the suggestion in this book where they provide helpful hints of what to order when eating out at various types of restaurants -  it makes eating healthy EASY!!!!    Looking forward to more reading this weekend!

B000005YZM|5.0|Answer:  When you are buying a copy of one of your favorite albums from the '60s.    The music was a \\"known\\";  I have been a fan for quite some time. This CD also had the mono versions of the songs which were originally mixed and not released. It was decided to release a stereo version which prompted re-mixes for that purpose. There are a few noticeable differences between mono and stereo that are interesting to someone like me. No \\"Paul is dead\\" moments or anything like that.    Included also is the \\"tracking session\\" (piano, drums, bass) for \\"Care of Cell 44\\" which, I suppose, one could sing along to were one so inclined. Most interesting is the alternate (and not used) mix of \\"A Rose for Emily\\" which is more Eleanor Rigbyish with cello accompaniment that did not find it's way to the released version.     My wife thoroughly dislikes \\"A Rose for Emily\\". Perhaps because I am so fond of the album, I tended to overlook it's somber tone. She's right:  it's a downer.    Priced right;  got there quick;  happy camper; max stars.....
0061964948|5.0|I was one of the original subscribers to the Hill House Publishers' Neil Gaiman Preferred Edition series and I thought I'd never get my copy of this gorgeous book.<br /><br />Thanks so much to everyone at William Morrow for taking over this edition and producing it so wonderfully.
1594488843|3.0|Pink appears to dance around the motivational theories of Maslow's hierarchy, without ever really referencing Maslow's work.     Citing just about every other work on motivational theory, Pink tries to build on these findings by creating his own theories and positioning them as something new, Type I & Type X. Type I (working on intrinsic motivation)mentioning that in the new world, people won't be driven by extrinisic motivators such as pay/financial rewards, but instead the challenge to seek autonomy, mastery and purpose in a role.  Seems a lot like Maslow's hierarch to me... i.e. basic needs for survival (i.e. food, shelter) having to be met before someone is ready to work harder to acheive 'self enlightenment' (intrinsic motivation).     Nevertheless, its a good read and I think works well to show why intrinsic motivation will be key, especially in motivating Gen Y and younger as they come into the workforce. But again, not something I found to be a groundbreaking finding that will re-define the way we see motivational theory for years to come...
0307269760|5.0|This Alice Munro's book of short stories is the first book of hers that I have read. I love short stories. As against the novel, writer faces a tougher job when writing a short story. And Alice Munro has mastered the techniques well.  There are ten stories in all. I read the hard cover edition. It has 307 pages. The longest story is the last one `Too Much Happiness'- the same as the title.  I loved this last story. All the stories are very good but the last one became my favorite. The setting is in the 19th  century in the Europe and takes place in Russia, Paris, Germany and France. All the rest of the stories take place in Canada.  I found all stories differ from each other in appreciable ways. In the story `Dimensions' the murder twist comes all off a sudden to surprise the readers. It's sad but pleasant surprise at the same time though.  The story \\"Fiction' about a carpenter husband's adultery ends in a predictable way but for more than half the stories the end feels too abrupt and is left for the readers to figure  out. This includes `Dimensions,' `Wood' `Wenlock Edge'. In this one I didn't understand the motivation of the older guy named `Purvis' ( a pervert) who insists on an unknown girl he invites for dinner to stay naked and why the girl obliges him.  Deep Holes is about a promising son gone wayward and leading a slacker's life. I could feel a mother's helplessness at the end. `Child's Play' is one of the most chilling stories in the whole book.   Many stories created a blue mood in my mind because the characters live such a pathetic, painful life. Only the last one `Too Much Happiness' lifted up my spirits.  But kudos to Alice Munro, who has written all the stories in her wonderful style. Few stories are written from a male point of view and they have worked well. There are sentences that titillate, passages that tickle and there are scenes and characters that will live in your memory for a long time.  I am glad I read this book and would highly recommendto anyone who enjoys short stories.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great plot ... what more could you want? Honestly though, I bought this movie because I know that I can watch it over and over. One of the key criticisms that people like to throw at Julie & Julia is that you don't get to see enough of Meryl Streep, but I find that there is actually a perfect balance. You see a lot of \\"Julie\\", yes, but the movie itself concludes with \\"Julia\\" : )
0307001369|5.0|All the illustrations my husband and I know and love from our own toddlerhood.  My almost 2 year old really likes this book and points out all of the familiar nouns!  I think it's kind of funny that the pages that show the family driving to town show a butcher shop... where the pig is a butcher.  I wonder what or whom he'll be turning into sausages.  Anyway, great book!
0307271862|3.0|Henning Mankell's books with the detective Kurt Wallander have always been rather heavy sledding for me with their melancholy, morose sleuth amid the cold Swedish landscape with characters that sometimes seem as if they have ice in their veins. His book \\"The Man from Beijing\\" was an even tougher slog for me. I had to do a lot of skimming to get through it. It begins with a very suspenseful, violent scene and ends with a very unsatisfying solution.<br />The novel's chilling and blood-curdling hook: eighteen elderly people, a twelve-year-old boy, and their pets are slaughtered in a small Swedish hamlet. The only three people who are spared are people who are not biologically related to the others. The scene is gruesome, overly graphic in detail. It turns out to be a revenge killing.<br />Judge Birgitta Roslin is a relation of sorts of the slain villagers, her mother grew up there, and she begins to investigate the case. She's not a very interesting protagonist. Mankell can really pick them. It's very difficult to warm to Mankell's characters, perhaps because the weather always seems depressing and gloomy with either snow coming down or about to.<br /> Long sections of the book deal with the past and are very boring. I think a good editor could have cut one hundred pages and made this into a fantastic thriller. Some books propel you along with their narrative drive; this one has the opposite effect.<br /> The judge makes a trip to Beijing as part of her journey of discovery, but that section is very strange and, in some ways, baffling and confusing. Parts of the book are very interesting indeed, but just be prepared to do some skimming.
B000NA2776|4.0|Very nice music, well arranged, good vocals, pleasant rhythm. I sepecially like the track Lollipop, which was further used by students to pefrorm a great piece of lipdub - see yourself at youtube under \\"HEC 2008\\".
1891252089|5.0|I've taken yoga off and on for years. But in the recent months I had been very focused on the practice. When my yogi decided to move away I freaked out. Then he told me to purchase this book and we spent 30+ hours going through it together. The combination of the book and personal instruction was amazing. Then I found out my yogi had studied with David for a year. The book had everything we have been working on for the past 4 months...now I am ready for \\"self-practice\\" at the primary level. When I master that, then I can move on to the second series with no problems with the help of this book. Breath follows movement was the essential element that has really transformed my practice.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a phenomenally told story of epic proportions. The characters seem so real, because they are, and hearing their stories first hand is both inspiring and heartbreaking. Though this was purchased on BluRay not all sequences of the film were in high definition ( though most were ) and the ones that weren't only added to the gritty war feel of the film. If you love true stories, war stories, and stories of relationships that survive when people do not, this is for you. My husband and I will watch this again and again.
B00361HV02|4.0|Another great album--more variety than on previous BRMC discs. There are three slower songs that would fit nicely on Howl, some good scorchin' rock songs, and a couple of slow stompers like War Machine, that aren't my personal cup of tea, but I'm sure some folks will enjoy.<br /><br />Not sure how I'd rank it with their other albums just yet, but it's worth having, for sure. One request to the new drummer: more cymbals!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|...and everyone I have suggested see it has loved it as well.  There is nothing else I can say which has not been said about this movie already.  Great voice acting, amazing stop-motion creatures and sets, quirky but appropriate soundtrack, and the elements which can be found in most Wes Anderson movies.  I like a lot of movies, but this is one of the very few I loved.  Recommended without hesitation.    For the videophile, if you are sick of showing off 'perfect' animation, this film will be of interest.  With the exception of a few trivial flaws found in just a few scenes for a few seconds, this is probably the best looking thing to come across my display.  This alone may be a reason to see it on Blu-ray.
0061735817|5.0|I was pretty captivated by Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book, so when I saw this book, I really wanted to listen to it. I loved it! Being a Christian, I wondered how this book would make me feel, but I was totally entertained. You've GOT to have a sense of humor about it, certainly!     I thought the narrator was fantastic. Because I had not read the book prior to my listening to it, I didn't have preconceived notions for the characters' voices. The CD's must have been updated, because unlike another listener's review stated, mine had announcements at the beginning and end of each CD.    I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did. I felt so sad when the book ended...and, Oh! The reference to the Harley in my title is because the Four Horsemen of the Apolcalypse--War, Pestilence, Pollution and Death--are all members of a motorcycle gang--the TRUE Hell's Angels! What fun!
B000MV90IU|5.0|Movie - pure fun. For Steve McQueen fans - a must. For anybody else - famous car chase on streets of San Francisco and criminial with a climat. Quality of picture and sound - just great.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a must see movie, if you love sports this is the movie to see and have.  I can see this movie over and over any time.  this is a family movie that anyone can watch and age can watch. The actor's and actress's are great in this movie.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|When I first saw this movie I thought it was weird.  Now that I have a chance to watch it again recently, I can appreciate what the director did with this movie.  The title to my review really says it all, this movie is as close as I've seen to a live version of a bugs bunny cartoon.  Yes, the humor is geared more towards those who are familiar to asian customs, but the actions and the story line are universal.  Plus I love the fact that the main heros and villians do not look like the cookie-cutter heros and villians that Hollywood bombards us with on a daily basis.  Check it out and you will love it!

0061122416|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho is already considered a classic. Despite the fact that it was only published in 1988 (1994 in English!), many readers have been captivated by \\"The Alchemist\\" and it has somewhat of a cult following. You don't know how many times I have heard \\"Everyone should read this!\\" when a customer stumbles upon it at my bookstore. And you know what? They are absolutely right.    Similarly to \\"The Little Prince\\" (one of my favs!), \\"The Alchemist\\" is a short, simple story with a deep, profound lesson. It begins with the main character, who is only ever referred to as \\"the boy\\" in Andalusia. He is a modest shepherd, but through a course of strange events, he decides to travel to Egypt to find treasure that he believes is buried at the pyramids. Along the way, this boy meets several people who influence his journey, including, but not limited to, a gypsy woman, a crystal salesman, a woman of the desert and, of course, an alchemist. The boy is also taught to listen to omens, which speak to him and help guide him to his treasure.    However, it is not the story that is of importance in \\"The Alchemist.\\" It is the beautiful lesson that Coelho teaches through this story. Coelho proclaims that everyone on Earth has a Personal Legend, but few ever discover what this legend is and fewer fulfill it. He urges readers to be aware and passionate, living life to the fullest, while working towards their Personal Legend. A charming twist at the end teaches yet another lesson (but I won't spoil it!).    I found \\"The Alchemist\\" to be an extremely inspiring and eye-opening novel. Rarely can a book make you re-evalute your existence as a human being, but Coehlo has achieved this feat. I guarantee that \\"The Alchemist\\" will get you thinking about your purpose on this Earth and what you really want to do with your life. With so many college students confused about their life and their path, \\"The Alchemist\\" is the perfect read for this age. Some guidance from wise Coelho and some self-reflection are all you need to get yourself back on track!

He always creates smart, funny, likable \\"heroes\\" and \\"heroines.\\" (I put it in quotes because even though they don't really contribute a ton as a result of the plot of the novel, they undergo heroic transformations!) The hero of \\"Paper Towns\\" is Quentin Jacobson. He is very normal, very smart and, as he says, very well-adjusted, thanks to his therapist parents. His neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman is pretty much the exact opposite: rebellious, popular, desired. Quentin and Margo were childhood friends, but clearly, their paths have since divided and Quentin has spent a good deal of time pining over Margo. One night, Margo appears at Quentin's window and takes him on a life-changing ride, pranking everyone who has done her wrong. And then she disappears.    Quentin is the last one to see Margo and also seems to be the only one who wants to find her.    Of course, this is only in the first few pages. Margo leaves Quentin clues, including a worn copy of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" by Walt Whitman (one of my favorite poets!) and paper towns, which are unfinished subdivisions and apparently, very popular in central Florida. Completing the book (and aiding Quentin on his journey) is Quentin's sidekick and best friend, Radar, who runs an online encyclopedia and helps deduce the mystery that is Margo.    Green is such a magnificent writer and really makes his readers think. His books always affect me WAY more than I expect, often more than any adult fiction book can. Perhaps because teen writers don't feel the need to complicate their works with jargon and complex metaphors; they just tell a really good story, simply and well. \\"Paper Towns\\" is interesting, endearing and well-written. The characters are multi-faceted and deep, each with their own story, thoughts and feelings. Again, Green's books, \\"Paper Towns\\" included, make me think, which I think is a mark of a great book.    Anyone who is looking for a nice, easy, yet impacting read should pick up \\"Paper Towns\\" by John Green.

1932100660|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for about 20 years, but have never known that there is more in it than just morals. It is amazing that animal protein can be this dangerous while it is still claimed it is our the best nutrition. I almost returned back to some meat, but now I feel no need and I am happy about my choice. I wish this information could be spread without any prejudices as much as possible. World diserves to know the truth and many people owe it a profound rehabilitation.

B0026RHR6K|4.0|BGS is one of the best written and produced series in the last decade.  Exciting, poignant, culturally relevant...all the qualities that good sci-fi should have.  Box is really counterintuitive though.  Not a huge deal, but I hope no one uses this design.
B002VH7P4O|2.0|The music itself is phenomenal, however this review is of the Apple 16gb USB. First off, around 9.2gb are used, this extra space could have been used for the mono versions, high rez booklets, etc. The tracks lack proper ID3v2 tagging, and in some cases have the wrong artwork. There are no lyrics or production notes. Overall, I am likely to rip the cds and rewrite the drive (if i can unlock it) with proper copies. I will keep the FLAC files, though I cant tell if they are actually any better.     Product support is nonexistent. Amazon wanted me to send the drive back, and EMI claims no responsibility. The drive shipped without the apple stem. I just wanted to order one or get a replacement, but I am left in frustration. I was hoping that the extreme cost of this item would at least leave me with a collectors item. I suppose I will see if Amazon will still swap me out one. Until then, It sits with an actual apple stem jammed in the hole where the one I bought should have been.    (update)   Amazon was no help. EMI was no help. They both basically referred me to the other. The natural apple stem does not look bad. From what I have been able to read, the FLAC files were generated from the CDs, so no improved quality there. The apple itself will sit on a shelf and pretend it does not suck. Luckily, Im the only one around here dumb enough to have bought this.     I am not impressed with EMI or amazon.com. Usually Amazon is great, but this was really unacceptable. This is a collectors item, and an expensive one. I received a broken item.
0307463745|5.0|Rework is the logical follow up to Getting Real. Like its predecessor it is clear, concise, and to the point. The authors distill their experience down into easily manageable gems of insight while empowering the reader to do it their own way.    I'm going to buy copies for several friends. You should do the same.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|We watched our DVD show last night that was presented in the beautiful huge Mandelay Auditorium in Los Vegas. There is a full orchestra and specialized instruments feaatured here and there.  It was absolutely the best, with a good variety of great singers and entertainers giving out their best offerings. A very likeable David Foster has a relaxed way of emceeing the show and introducing all this talent while playing the piano through most of the music.  The calibre of the talent is the best of the best. Song after song, it just gets better and better!  With High Definition, our new bluray player and sound bar speaker, it was like we were really there, but with a front row seat.  There was genuine affection between David and all these performers that he has worked with and helped with his own level of musicality and wide knowledge of the business.   After hearing all the performers and the musical enhancements that he has helped with in the past in various media, you have to know that David Foster is a great song-writer and an amazing talent himself!    Get this show.  You won't regret it !

B002XUBDZ6|2.0|This Bluray disc is not much better than a DVD.  I like to watch Bluray because of the high def sound and picture.  Some transfers are just not worth it.  If you own it on DVD, stick with it.
B0034EEE2E|3.0|I wanted to like this but literally every track has the same musical treatment.  Even some of the melodies are bit too similar to each other.  The tracks could use another layer of really anything (guitar or violin perhaps?) to make these tracks work better.  The vocals have an echo component to them, which is fine, but it is used on every track. There are subtle components to the tracks, especially with the vocals and electronic drums but it isnt enough to sustain _all_ of these tracks.  Sorry but I just couldnt get my head around how similar all of the tracks are to each other.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />This film is a \\"reboot\\" of the Star Trek franchise, putting new actors into the old roles, and painting a pleasingly modern gloss over the whole thing. This has stirred some controversy, but only amongst some of the Trekkers. I think, given that there's no way a big FX-heavy movie aimed just at the hardcore fans could make money, the producers were right to say \\"Forget it, we're going mainstream.\\" And there's so much hate in Trek-dom these days (sadly), the haters were going to hate it anyway...<br /><br />That said, my personal reaction is the same as most here: I'm ambivalent, but positive overall. I don't particularly like the popcorn ride aspect of the film, or the plot holes (throwing Kirk off the ship instead of into the brig). The callousness with which our heroes blew Nero away at the end left a bad taste in my mouth; and Bana's Nero was unimpressive IMO - not so much a cosmic villain, more a guy who picks fights in bars. And the engine room looked like a brewery ;)<br /><br />OTOH, we can agree that the casting was generally excellent, and the character interaction very enjoyable as well as being true to the original. Most of the cast bring their parts to life with the spirit of their originals. For me, Chris Pine doesn't quite have the quirky individuality Shatner gave to the role, but plenty of people love his performance, and it's hard to dislike his energy and enthusiasm for the part. Other elements were quite squee-worthy, of course: Sulu possibly even cooler than in the original, Scotty made even more Scottish; beaming with the original sound effects, Uhura/Spock, \\"Get out of the chair\\", the eager redshirt; the alternate timeline device, which I think in retrospect was the only way they could really go. I could go on. I have no problem with Kirk making captain - you guys never hear of a field promotion?<br /><br />In terms of production (sets, costumes, effects, sounds, photography), this film meets the highest standards. The music is very good, and extremely epic when it needs to be. (For music nerds: however, I think it's a shame that the new main theme doesn't resolve, it just repeats and then ends in a punched-out major chord. The optimism of the Trek philosophy demands a satisfying resolution to the main theme! Also, the brass playing occasionally sounded a bit coarse.)<br /><br />Unless they really jump the shark, I think the next film should be pretty good too.<br /><br />3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.<br /><br />***/SPOILERS***remely epic when it needs to be.

0312370849|5.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" just \\"sounded\\" interesting to me from the blurb on Amazon and from the few pages I read in Inside the Book. I ordered it for a vacation read and probably missed some of the attractions in Florida because I couldn' put the book down! Obviously, this is a fascinating story on its own but De Rosnay's style and unusual approach to the telling of two stories similtaneously is a creative plus! Immediately, I felt I knew the young girl on her way to a concentration camp with her parents. Immediately, I felt I knew the married woman living in Paris in the modern age. How their lives touch, years apart, is a jewel of writing that will bring tears, perhaps, but will also bring joy that life sometimes does move in circles, resolving and healing wounds of the past.<br /><br />This is a fine read and I want to read more of Tatiana de Rosnay's writings. She's good. She's very good!<br /><br />Joyce Norman<br />Author/Publisher
031606792X|5.0|This really is the best book in the Twilight saga. I cannot believe all the negative reviews. I think Stephanie did a wonderful job with this book. We finally see Bella grow up and come into herself as a women. She final does some standing up as oppossed to cowering behind the \\"strong\\" men in her life. I have read this book more than all the others combined. Please, don't let the negative reviews make you miss one of the most compelling books you will ever read.
B0009VJYKM|5.0|\\"God wants chain stores\\"  Walmartians rejoice! The lord has given you (at a discount) everything (except the one thing) that you need to be happy and content..................    I've been listening to this album for about 20 years now and it gets better every year. Roger was in a perfect space when this was produced and it seems unlikely that will happen again. Both historical and prophetic, this recording is the perfect example of why the music industry no longer allows anyone (who has talent and passion) to obtain the level of success that Floyd had. A searing rip of the marketplace and for profit religion, is tempered by the humanity and guilt of Alf.   If \\"I was stuck on a island\\" this album would be in the top five easily.

B002VECM6S|3.0|This movie first of all requires a suspension of disbelief. What high school coach puts a kid on the practice field without first going over the basic rudiments of the blocking game required of a lineman. Also, the film gives the impression that all major college coaches wanted Michael Oher solely on the basis of the one block in which he blocked an opposing lineman back into his own end zone and deposited him over a protective barrier. The football sequences were by in large weak and unimpressive.Lastly, I didn't get the whole NCAA interrogation thing. They should have been thankful that a family cared enough to take him in and given some purpose to his life, let alone a university who was willing to take a chance on him with his poor academic achievement records.     Sandra Bullock gave a creditable performance, but Academy Award status, I think not; Meryl Streep in a walk for sure. The best acting was displayed by the young man who played Bullock's son. Precocious doesn't begin to describe this young actor's ability. He steals every scene in which he appears.     This is certainly a feel good, inspirational story. But, somehow it misses the mark on drama and true reality. It is great for family viewing (Which is truly something hard to come by these days), but it lacks the biting edge (sans profanity) that is needed to push it into the classic or near classic film category.
0307454541|5.0|This is my favorite book of the three. Great characters. Wish he were still alive to write more....
B002XMGGK6|3.0|Well, I was expecting this to be an okay movie with everything on its place and nothing else. But actually this is one very good film with two MAJOR quality elements here:<br /><br />FIRST<br />The performances are amazing. Both Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are STUNNING. Their characters are complex and all motivational elements were beautifully written. Foxx is no surprise, but Butler did surprise me. I wasn't expecting him to be such a great actor... but he is.<br /><br />SECOND<br />The premise is brilliant: a man has to deal with the fact that the man who murdered his family gets a deal. This is amazing material,<br /><br />Not so great things: unfortunately, as the second half unfolds, the film tries to become a heavy thriller (and gets a little contrived) and somehow tends to forget the amazing premise and drama it started with.<br /><br />Still... this is a very good film to watch.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I rarely get hooked on a TV series.  Dexter is an exception to this.  This series is as close to perfection as a series can get.  Lots of action, very humorous, great plots.
B000RO9PXC|1.0|I went to the second show that night. The show started late on account of a fire next door. Morrison was so drunk,and incoherent,that the cops shut the show down. That's my one and only experience with The DOORS. Still loved them though. There has never been,nor will there be a performer like James Douglas Morrison. God bless the   Lizard King!
1439190275|5.0|Having used the original Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution when I was a young woman, and staying at a normal and healthy weight for many years, I would recommend that you enjoy this latest, most updated and complete version of The Atkins lifestyle and eating plan. It is well written, has pages of scientific references and easy to follow instructions for a wonderful and easy way to reduce weight, and correct many of the conditions that accompany being overweight, such as elevated blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. I am not a scientist or a doctor, but the facts are clear, the American diet falls short, and low carbohydrate living is easy and healthy. I loved this book!
B001NXDIMK|4.0|I loved the dvd. Very exciting. Great Characters.<br /><br />Very disappointed that I could not get closed caption in English. I had purchased this video for my parents with hearing difficulty.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|So, this takes 1.01, puts it over it's proverbial knee and... spanks it.  I'll be brief, Eva 1.11 is THE definitive Evangelion (part 1) movie all us Eva fans have been waiting for for so so long.. long.    I think my mouth was agape from start to finish.  I was excited when I heard about the Evangelion rebuild project and was pleased with what they managed to accomplish with 1.01 but after seeing 1.11, you will either a) immediately sell or b) never ever watch the 1.01 version again.    STUNNNING, absolutely STUNNING bluray visuals, sound and possibly even beter than those two points, the build and edit of 1.11 is far superior to that of 1.01 and as a result the viewer is compltely sucked in and enthralled throughout the entire motion picture experience and as exagerrated as some of this review may seem it is hard to fuly express how solid of a movie Evangelion 1.11 is without gushing... some. ;)    Even if you've never seen anything Evangelion related you can watch this stunner and rest assured your time and money will be very well spent.    Enjoy!
1439190275|5.0|This book gives a great way to improve your health.  There are options for people who are vegetarians as well.  Atkins recommends that you eat a lot of vegetables and other whole foods. Personally, I have lost 39 lbs in 6 months and I feel great.  This book is definitely worth buying and reading.  My labs are improved and my doctor is very happy with my progress.     This is the ONLY way of eating that really works for me personally.

0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins managed to continue the series with the surprise addition of an anniversary set of Games.  Now all the past winners must fight each other.  Now that they are all seasoned fighters and killers, and we are all over the shock of the concept, it is less disturbing than the innocent young children being forced to kill each other in Hunger Games.  This book focusses a lot of time on life in the district after the first book's ending and less on the fighting.  Relationships are detailed and characters are further developed.  This book has a lot more depth than the first.  Collins continues to surprise.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I have been watching nature documentaries before I knew how to use a toilet...basically I have pretty high standards for them. This Series is the best I've seen yet!!! Planet Earth Comes very close and may be as good...but this blu ray should be in everyone's collection! Get this BBC Version!
0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games exemplifies reality tv gone too far.  This is a dystopic take of Panem, the replacement for the US after the world collapses upon itself.  In Panem, the capitol controls 12 districts, which they keep near starvation.  Another method of control is by requiring the sacrafice of two children from each district, reminiscent of the short story Lottery.  However, in this case, the children are not just put to death.  They are sent to the capitol and put in an arena to fight each other to the death.  One of the 24 children will survive. Their motivation to try to win, is not only to stay alive, but to be a provider for food for their district that year and for their family for life. Hunger games introduced us to two children Katniss and Peeta who are sent to the capitol to be trained and then fight.  Katniss is sympathetic to us because she sacraficed herself so her younger sister wouldn't have to go.  However, she struggles throughout the book between what it is turning he into - a murderer - vs the chance to save her family.  As she struggles within herself, she also begins to care for Peeta.  However, there can only be one winner.  The fight will be broadcast nationwide for a mandatory audience who will vote and impact some of their survival needs.  The chidren must develop personas and play to the audience in order to help their chance of survival.  This is the aspect that makes the reader begin to look at all reality tv with distaste.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|True blood is a great series.  Purchasing the season set gave us a chance to see all the episodes we missed.
B00005NGSE|5.0|I don't like live albums - I prefer the studio versions of most songs.<br /><br />That having been said, \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" is one of the exceptions to the rule... an excellent live album, definitely one to get. (Others are [[ASIN:B00005R62N Judas Priest: Unleashed in the East]] and [[ASIN:B00005NY5L Girlschool/Live]])<br /><br />It's classic Scorpions - the 1970's lineup with Ulrich Roth on lead guitar. Songs like \\"We'll Burn The Sky\\" and \\"Polar Nights\\" are only enhanced on this album; in fact, they sound better than the studio versions. Some songs are ones that you won't find anywhere else, such as \\"Suspender Love\\", which is good and quirky.<br /><br />There's a lot of raw energy on this album - all the stuff they'd done to date (\\"Steamrock Fever\\", \\"Robot Man\\", \\"Pictured Life\\" are particular favorites) is amped up with some serious live energy. Even the poignant \\"Kojo No Tsuki\\" (a tribute to their Japanese hosts) has some serious power to it. The Scorpions' versions of \\"Hound Dog\\" and \\"Long Tall Sally\\" are nicely done as well.<br /><br />If you like rock and metal, you'll want to get this album - even if you're not a fan of live music. One word of warning, though - if you're buying this, get the two disc set... the single disc doesn't contain \\"Suspender Love\\" or \\"Polar Nights\\". Of course, the 2-disc vinyl version is even better, but good luck with that.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|These specials are the last times we see David Tennant performing wonderfully as The Doctor. As expected, he gives his best in each of these, giving us performances that we can definitely remember.    If you're a fan of the latest Doctor Who series, then you'll want to have this as part of your collection. The End of Time alone is important enough to have, as it closes out the Tenth Doctor's chapter.    It also is the last time Russell T. Davies is executive producer for Doctor Who. The stories and threads that are tied up definitely show us the end of one era and the beginning of a totally new one, one that will be exciting, to say the least.
1594488916|5.0|By Bill Marsano This is a fine, gracefully written book about the cat-and-mouse game between John Gilkey, persistent and multiply convicted rare-book thief and Ken Sanders, the rare-book dealer who is hunting him down. Bartlett gets close to both, and in doing so regales us with diverting stories of book crime and book criminals--appetizers to her main course, which is getting inside Gilkey's head. A tricky business, this, because by and large the real difference between Gilkey and other rare-book collectors that he steals and they pay. Otherwise he, like most collectors, is more interested in the object than its contents--the thrill of the hunt, the bragging rights conferred by success.<br /><br />It is also an important book for reporters. It is the story of a reporter who investigated corruption until it bedazzled her, until she became what she beheld. It is a five-star warning.<br /><br />As Bartlett learns in frequent interviews in and out of prison, Gilkey is clever and a master of rationalizations. He doesn't, he says, steal books--he `gets' them. Losses don't matter--the insurance company will compensate his victims. If not, no matter: then book dealers in general are crooked and charge too much. They deserve to be robbed. They should regard theft as part of doing business. He himself is never in the wrong, and actually he is far shallower than the shallower legitimate (paying) collectors. Gilkey has no interest in books except as expressions of trappings of gentility, as outward signs of the cultured person he wants, or thinks he wants, to be. And so he steals only books that are on this or that \\"100 Best\\" list. He's clever enough to makes suckers out of dealers and Bartlett, too. She sinks into ethical mire as she learns more and more about Gilkey and his crimes and lacks the courage to do anything  about it. Finally she winds up making excuses for him: he is, he tells her, enrolled in college. She believes him (fool, she!), and  decides to believe he's pretty much like other obsessed collectors: `I realized that the man I thought was stealing books so that others would consider him a cultured gentleman . . . was in fact working diligently to BECOME that gentleman. He was studying philosophy, researching authors, even writing his own essays and plays . . . . attempting to create his ideal self. Another way of begetting this self, I came to understand, was by telling his story through me.' (Bartlett is from San Francisco, where there must be something in the air that warps your brain as soon as the word 'self' comes up.) More than once Bartlett worries enough about her involvement that she consults lawyers. They--don't you just love `em?--say she's LEGALLY off the hook, so she largely ignores ethics and morality. What Bartlett tells us is fascinating; what she doesn't is morally important.<br /><br />Others here, although not criminal, are hardly blameless: dealers who whine about thefts they did little or nothing to prevent and won't report out of mere embarrassment, and the law, which often regards book theft as little more than a prank or a quirk.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning professional writer and a book- and map-lover whose collections may be small but weren't stolen.

0446560065|5.0|Well, first off, if you're expecting a comic strip like Garfield, your expectations will be only half-met.    The book consists mainly of sketches depicting Simon's Cat, and the other characters seen in the YouTube cartoons, as well as a few new others. That said though, I still found myself laughing out loud at most of the scenes depicted in the book, as my own cats have pulled a LOT of the same stunts!    Simon's Cat is a gem in a world with too few of them - I'm glad I made this purchase.

My child just loves to look at his, and the first night after recieving his he fell asleep with it. He takes it to school with him everyday to share with his friends and look at during his free reading time. I would have to say this purchase was money well spent.

The cooler fit snuggly inside the case and has taken my Idle temps from 23-24C to 16-17C and Load temps from 45C-50C to 30C-35C. I mounted it in the 12/6 o'clock position so that I can acess my RAM by just removing the 120mm fan instead of the whole cooler. My system is mildly overclocked at 3.4Ghz and this cooler handles that easily. The main reason I purchased this cooler is that my phenom II has a useable 4th core but I didnt want to unlock it with a stock HSF. This is my first performance heatsink install and while the instructions left alot to be desired, the install was not that hard. I also used Artic Silver thermal grease.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|Before seeing this movie somebody mentioned its very much like the movie Ferngully. After watching it it is very colorful with a setting in a rainforest and the aborigine's protecting it from the hi-tech intruders. Though the story plot is typical you know whats going to happen next. As another reviewer mentioned he left after an hour into the movie, I did the same as well. More of a movie for the younger crowd. Would really like to see some originality in the movies being produced nowadays (other than a different setting which was creative on Camerons behalf) but they are what they are cause this is what sells =/ ...
B0025KVLU6|4.0|What an excellent addition to my collection, this remastered copy was very well packaged and had great sound. I was not disappointed.
0316096199|5.0|By now, most of you have heard of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" ... a movie which started as a book written by Alice Sebold.  If not for her quick-thinking and clever strategy of getting into the mind of her attacker, Alice would never have had the chance to write The Lovely Bones ... instead she would have become them.  This book is the story of her own brutal rape as a freshman at Syracuse University, an act she tried very hard to forget but which became her driving force for justice, and then for a spiraling descent into the lowest moments of her life.  If you've ever wondered about the dirty little secrets entwined in this crime, Alice reveals them all ... even the bad side of justice as we learn about the revenge rape of her friend, whose friendship she ultimately loses.  As someone who was nearly raped by a man with a knife, I have always wondered \\"what if\\" I hadn't maneuvered my way out of that incident.  Alice's story gives me closure, and I now realize just how \\"lucky\\" I was.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I had no idea what to expect--I was actually hoping for some sorts of comedy. However, t turned out to be a sort of serious movie--serious in the context of evoking emotion. There are sentimental wrinkles, but overall a good movie. As I said, \\"it moves you.\\" I see other low stars. Everyone has his/her reasons, but I don't think it deserves just one star. Watch it. I am sure you will enjoy it.
0143038419|2.0|Was not happy with my purchase because I paid more for a nicer book, but the book was not nice. It smelled, was dirty and had bent pages.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|Mr. Verhoeven ought to record a director's commentary, with some Joe Esterhaz and Jacques Rivette thrown in for good measure.
1424817870|4.0|[[ASIN:B0001Z3TXE 50 First Dates]] is absolutely charming. Adam Sandler's girlfriend (Drew Barrymore) loses her short-term memory, so he must find a way to save their relationship when she doesn't remember it. Of course, it's totally unrealistic, but nonetheless heart-warming. This is a light-hearted movie and doesn't really get philosophical about amnesia and love, but it's good for a relaxing date movie.<br /><br /> The movie also has adorable penguins and walruses and other animals, which make great supporting characters. Rather than Adam Sandler seeking advice from wise old men, he asks the walruses - with bizarre consequences!
0061730327|5.0|I absolutely loved William's story. He provides a fascinating glimpse into African culture that is usually out of reach. I enjoyed reading about his life, especially his discovery of science. The hardship his community endured is staggering, but William's and his family's response to suffering is even more amazing. I highly recommend this book for adults and their kids.
B00003CXSM|2.0|There's nothing really exciting in [[ASIN:B00003CXSM The Wedding Planner]]. The plot is cliché - a chance encounter leading to \\"love on first sight,\\" but one of them is already engaged to get married. I feel like I've seen this story so many times, even though I've only actually watched this movie once. It also wasn't funny enough to be a romantic COMEDY. I can only recall one funny scene - involving a statute and a certain limb that falls off - but the rest is forgettable.
B00006AW2L|3.0|There's no indication on the Amazon description that this is a DSD Remaster. What's the difference? You can copy it to your computer and play it, but you can't copy it to any other device or blank CD. They should let the buyer know beforehand. I'm sending my copy back. The music's good, but I want to be able to play it without being at my computer.
B00328G4V6|3.0|A curious mixed bag. On the one hand you have excellent readings of Sunshine Of Your Love, Valleys Of Neptune and the great reworking of Stone Free done in 1969. For me that's a compelling reason to get this disk. On the other hand you have a lot of jammy stuff that's sometimes brilliant, but often lackluster. And for some perverse reason several songs are renamed to make them appear new. Mr. Bad Luck is Look Over Yonder and Lullaby For The Summer is Ezy Rider. Yeah these may (or may not) have been the original titles, but c'mon. Crying Blue Rain however is an original blues. Though the sound quality is often excellent, Valleys Of Neptune is merely an ok collection and is in no way a completed album. Rather its a grab bag of sketches, interesting sketches, but sketches none the less. If you're a Hendrix completist get it, otherwise I'd pass.
0061922315|5.0|Just read this book over a transatlantic journey. Couldn't put the book down once I started it. It's a simple tale of two families separated geographically but connected through a common bond- the secret daughter. It's written straight from the heart and one can empathize with all the characters, as they are so real. I seldom cry while reading a book but this one brought tears in my eyes. I would highly recommend it to all mothers, daughters and to anyone who has ever adopted or is thinking of adopting a child. Looking forward to Gowda's new book...
B00275EGWY|1.0|This is another proof (if one was still needed) tha Oscar is like politcs, but worse. This insane amount of awards for such a pedestrian war movie? Heck, \\"PLATOON\\" blows this out of the water anytime, even watching it today. Saving Private Ryan, same thing. I could mention a lot of others (Black Hawk Down; Cross of Iron).<br /><br />Direction is sloppy; acting is average. Photography is so-and-so. A lot of war movies managed to show the conflict, tensions, pscilogical doubts AND the action much better.<br /><br />Maybe they simply did not want AVATAR to gather all the awards (I'm not saying it did deserve it or not; I'm just guessing); maybe they wanted a female director to get it (no prejudice here-just analysing the statistics).<br /><br />Highly disappointing.
B0035G9ABQ|1.0|I'm a huge Gorillaz fan, and a Damon Albarn fan, but this album is a let down, its nothing but a snthy under produced, record. The only songs I like Are glitter frezze, and superfast jelly fish (the only track that has real drums). Its not even close to their self titled, Demon Days, or D-Sides. I thought this record was going to be amazing after hearing Damon on BBC Radio 1, play Electric Shock (NOT ON THE ALBUM), Stylo, and Broken, back in Jan. 09'. These demos blew my mind, and have better production than plastic beach. So I waited a whole year thinking plastic beach was going to be amazing, and before the realease of it they put (Gorillaz Teasers) on youtube I heard these awesome clips of songs that never ended up on the album. I was very disapponted this time around. Hope for the realease of those songs in the future. I don't think Damon made the right choice of producing it, he's a great musician, but should not have become a producer, this album lacks so much, he should of got back Dan the Automator, Danger Mouse, or a new producer beck would have been my choice, many others tho.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought one of these for the tool box and was pleasantly surprised at the edge it put on a knife. The ceramic side leaves a smooth, sharp finish to an edge and the rod, although a bit coarse, touches up a serrated edge just fine.  A simple product that does what it's intended to do.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Congratulations to Zowie Bowie!, what a great movie you have come up with.  Fed my imagination as a child with Gerry Anderson and such shows as UFO and Space 1999, I think Duncan may have also.  This movie is so moving, Sam Rockwell is excellent and totally beleivable as his clones.  The soundtrack completes the package.  I have only ever bought one soundtrack in my life, and that was \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" So praise to Clint Mansell.  Go on buy it....you will watch it more than once!
B00169N0BK|4.0|I was totally blown away by the before and after results of my first monitor calibration.<br />If you are serious about your pictures, do any post processing, or are frustrated with the way your prints look compared to what you see on your monitor, you need to calibrated your monitor and printer.  The ColorMonki is not the cheapest profiler out there but then you get what you pay for.  The ColorMunki is a breeze to install, use and produces printer profiles in just a few minuets. My prints have gone from barely acceptable to outstanding.
B000J3Q8U4|5.0|Also known as Emmanuelle in Bangkok, has to be the most erotic non-sexually explicit movie ever made. A gorgeous cast of women and men headlined by Sylvia Kristel, this was by far the finest movie in the entire Emmanuelle series. Francis Lai's beautifully seductive and haunting score throughout, adds to the rich photography and passion laced scenes. I've always said let me personally experience the massage parlor scene before I die. That scene features the beautiful Laura Gemser who went on the play \\"Black Emmanuelle\\" in a later series. This movie never fails to romantically stir both myself and my female companion who is watching at the time. I have given this as a gift on 6 separate occasions to good friends. If you're looking for porn, this isn't it. If you're looking for an erotic  stimulus for mind and body however...
B003102JDM|5.0|This movie serves well as an Obituary for American Judaism. The \\"golem\\" metaphor at the beginning of the movie is a reflection of Judaism itself. I say this as a Jew who has lived in Israel.<br />The main character's  pathetic nature is reinforced by all the worst in modern-day Judaism. This pathetic reflection of a man out-of-touch with himself, wife and kids, remains a harsh reflection of much of Western Culture, stripping bare of what in reality it means to 'yield-to-be-good' in a post-diaspora world.<br /><br />It is a rare movie that I finish and think to watch again very soon. There is so much power in the exploration of this weak, browbeaten man. I enjoyed the fact that he could appear to be more-than adequate at work, but a total wimp with wife, and stand helplessly cuckolded, even allowing the adulterer to dictate terms to him, and have him move to a motel as the wife's lover prepares to take over the man's wife, home and family.<br />The bribe business is merely the last piece of himself that he surrenders. He's already surrendered manhood and fatherhood, now he surrenders his integrity, honesty and professionalism even as he gets what he's seeking. The complexity of the summation is only made more beautiful as he gets the medical \\"bad news,\\" and the tornado is artistic perfection.<br /><br />It really is a bare-knuckle indictment of modern man as well as Judaism, within its stripping bare of the nonsense and almost paganistic ritualism of chanting irrelevent Hebrew, the glowing parents and his lawyers/co-workers' glowing-reviews of the stoned 13 year-old all combined to make a point brilliantly.<br /><br />I think in this post diasporic END TIMES, a film like this is a jewel. The dream sequences with the canoe and his brother were phenomenal. The sexy neighbor sequences were great, as you wonder if she will make a man out of him, sort of she's gonna 'save' him type thing with sex and marijuana, and when he suddenly wakes up in that motel room, you feel like it's YOU who have been dropped out of that exciting dream yourself.<br /><br />Just a great piece of work; brilliantly ending with the approach of apocalypse, which is what this kind of man, replicated by the tens of millions amongst us today, will bring to humanity to hasten its doom.ke it's YOU who have been dropped out of that exciting dream yourself.<br /><br />Just a great piece of work; brilliantly ending with the approach of apocalypse, which is what this kind of man, replicated by the tens of millions amongst us today, will bring to humanity to hasten its doom.
1400064287|5.0|I bought this book first on Audible (LOVE audible) and I'm now listening to it for the second time.  I run an IT Architecture group and this book is full of great ideas for those of us who are charged with explaining complex topics and attempting to drive change.  I bought copies for my entire team and we are reviewing it chapter by chapter.  Highly recommended.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I enjoyed the story but not nearly as much as the other titles. It seemed to keep going and going...and more than once I caught myself scanning. I wanted to know what happened ...I was invested, but I wasn't interested in the minute details that clogged, rather than improved, the story. I wouldn't reccommend it.
1594488843|5.0|I have been a business coach for near ten years and all I can say is that I wish I had stumbled upon Drive and its surprising truths when I first set out to coach others.  I have known for a while that extrenal motivation is fruitless for so many endeavors in life but until I read this book I have never been able to put my finger on how or why.  Daniel Pink does a masterful job of explaining the descrepancy between what business (and parents, teachers etc...) do and what science knows.  There is almost no other common thirst than to try and discern what motivates us to do some things and not others.  I get this question daily.  I further get to walk with frustrated individuals who have been trapped in old thinking that leads to a continual attempt to try and get themselves motivated to sell more, make more calls, finish a project or break a bad habit.  This book and its subsequent teaching does a materful job of explaining how so many of us have had it wrong for so long.  You will not be dissapointed by a single page in this book.  I dare say that if you read it and adhere to its principals you will be a much better business person and human being.  This book should be mandatory for any teacher, leader or parent who has knots on thier heads and holes in the walls having tried too long to motivate others using outdated and poorly thoughtout techniques.  Bravo, Mr. Pink.  I thought A Whole New Mind was brilliant - Drive is off the charts.  I feel freed from 2.0 motivation - thank you for helping.  You are a world class artist!
0061906220|5.0|I first saw this book when it was self-published here in Georgia and was amazed at the reception it received everywhere it went. The reaction of children from as young as 2 years old to seven was incredible. It instanly became their favorite book and was a nightly read. The accompaning music/story that can be downloaded(free) with this publication by Harper Collins actually means that it isn't long before the children know the story by heart and love to help read it sometimes with much gusto. A YouTube video of just such an occurence gives a clear idea of what goes on with children when two adorable little girls read Pete the Cat themselves at bedtime.
0307346617|5.0|It's the same story in most every zombie film. Walking dead appear and begin to sweep across the world, joined by their freshly gnawed victims to form an unstoppable army. Small pockets of determined survivors band together to battle the horde, a few die in appropriately horrific style and in the end humanity survives reduced but changed for the better.    These conventions form the outline of Max Brooks' \\"World War Z,\\" but there's a key difference between the book and films: the book feels real. Brooks, who became the most prolific zombie author since H.P. Lovecraft with his wildly entertaining \\"Zombie Survival Guide,\\" has written a contemporary holocaust novel which could become the definitive undead novel.    Brooks maps the entire course of the \\"Zombie War,\\" beginning with scattered outbreaks in the Far East and spreading through tourists and refugees hiding infected zombie bites. The hordes push humans to isolated locations - South Pacific Islands, Rocky Mountains and aircraft carriers - where they begin to fight back with new weapons and tactics, preparing to defeat an enemy that feels no fear and needs decapitation to finally drop.    The structure Brooks takes for \\"World War Z\\" is a masterstroke. Rather than write in conventional novel format, he tells the story in the guise of a postwar researcher collecting interviews for the reformed United Nations. The book consists of interviews with over 40 different subjects, written as though they were taken verbatim off a tape recorder.    This interview format allows Brooks to create stories worth listening to, as he can use an endless supply of voices to tell how the world dealt with the calamity. Soldiers speak in a veteran tone with \\"G\\" and \\"Zack\\" to describe the enemy, children who grew up in the combat emotionlessly describe dead parents and government officials desperately try to justify being caught off guard.    There's also some particularly entertaining individual stories, which will no doubt come in handy when Brad Pitt's film company develops its promised adaptation. Vivid entries include a Japanese hacker climbing down an apartment building armed only with knowledge gathered online and a supply pilot shot down in the swamps of Louisiana, working to overgrown freeways for pickup.    What the stories do particularly well, however, is depict a postwar world that feels entirely plausible. Cuba, thanks to its geography and shrewd dealing with refugees, is now the world's economic superpower, while a decimated Russia has reformed into a Holy Russian Empire. Iran is decimated by nuclear weapon use, Canada is deforested for fuel and North Korea's entire population disappears into underground tunnels - with no clues if anyone is still alive.    This keen interpretation of politics is central to \\"World War Z,\\" not only to create a new world but to implement zombie satire in the style of George Romero. In Brooks' world, Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War are only precursors to government incompetence - lying to avoid widespread panic, an impotent bureaucracy and an army devoid of volunteers all pitch in to hang bait signs on the average citizen.    By the end of the novel, Brooks will have his readers convinced that if zombies were to attack tomorrow, even with his guide no hope of survival is nil. It's that tension, imagination and realism that keeps a reader completely gripped by \\"World War Z\\" - a book which establishes Brooks as one of the cleverest young authors out there and reanimates the zombie genre.
1594488843|5.0|Dan Pink's new book Drive was fascinating.  First book I've ready by him and I'm impressed.  He had some interesting insights into what really drives \\"knowledge workers\\" and the types of work environments that are the best.     It was hard to put the book down.  Definitely recommend it.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is a quintessential action flick one must see! This is one of my top 5 favorite movies!<br />Cinema goers at the time (late 80s) are introduced to Bruce willis, from sitcom star on TV to action hero.... Willis is the man, my second favorite actor next to Harrison Ford (love to see those 2 together on screen), it wasn't just his performance as wise ass, average joe, always in the wrong place at the wrong time, New York cop John McClane, it's the way director John Mcterien handled the direction of the movie, using the Nakatomi building as an integral part of the movie, and of course everyone loves Alan Rickman as the baddie Hans (no other Die Hard villain comes close... well maybe Jeremy Irons) and when Hans changes accents when meeting McClane, ohhhh how conniving! Like I said this is a perennial in action movies, you have shoot outs, explosions, little T&A, a wise ass hero who does bleed, who is not invincible, can be vulnerable, uses his wits to survive, and of course utters everyone's favorite line, \\"Yippe Ki yay mother *****\\" I've seen this a hundred times and still get a kick out of it and after Die Hard we got similar movies of this type like Under Siege where the popular phrase to describe said movie as \\"Die Hard on a Boat\\", or Excutive Decision \\"Die Hard on a plane\\". This is how influential this movie is, it laid out the blue prints for these type of action movies.<br /><br />After Die Hard we got 3 more sequeals and all good in their own right, but the original is the best, haven't seen it on blu ray, own the 5 Star 2 Disc Collector's Edition and still looks good on the Flat Screen, might up grade... this movie is so worth checking out
B002VECMAE|4.0|A reporter (Ewan McGregor) goes to Iraq to learn about a secret U.S Army that train to fight with their minds. There wasn't a lot of critics that liked the movie, but I found it to be fun and interesting. George Clooney and Jeff Bridges are great together for instance. Bridges basically playing \\"the Dude\\" in the military, I found to be hilarious.<br /><br />  While Clooney's performance here is under-rated since he's not being cocky, nor does he stroll around like he's all that. When he's not just playing someone who thinks they're the hottest and coolest guy in the world, that's when he shows he can act. He's fun here as a soldier who really believes that he has special powers. Kevin Spacey also gets one of his better roles in awhile as a soldier who wants to take over the paranormal military. He has evil ideas, like training by seeing if you can kill a goat just by staring at it. I can also say that Stephen Lang (Avatar,Public Enemies) didn't have one bad role in 2009 and that he had a break out year. He's pretty funny as a Colonel who runs into walls to see if he can go through them.<br /><br /> The movie probably could have been just a little better. Everyone is in good form, but the movie is missing something. It could have been longer and we could have learned a little bit more about this nutty army. Either way, I loved the movie. I didn't expect anything special from it though. So if you don't have high expectations for it, you might it enjoy it more.
0307266303|5.0|If you are a runner you have to read this book. It is so motivating and not what you would expect. Each chapter is a surprise. It is one of those books you want to read again and again because the story is so interesting. It has made me a better runner, not because of techical tips, but because it reminded me anything is possible.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is a very good representation of Jane Austen's Emma.  Beautiful costuming, great sets, good cinematography, together with strong acting make this film rendition one to enjoy through the years.  The story lines stays true to the novel with only a few of the novel's scene's left out and the characters are all true to Austen's writing.  Very enjoyable!
B00081MUY0|5.0|The first Donovan-Mickie Most-John Cameron collaboration and Donovan's big step into the world of psychedelic rock. The tracks are all great...  Sunshine Superman- \\"Sunshine super duper man\\" as Donovan describes it in the liner notes. Originally retitled \\"For John and Paul\\", it was written directly for his muse and future wife Linda Lawrence to get her back into his life. And she did about four years later.   Legend of a Girl Child Linda- A six minute fairy tale again inspired by Linda. While one reviewer likened it to Narnia it could be more Lewis Carroll inspired, but I guess that was just that person's opinion.  Three Kingfishers- Actually the song is called \\"Twelve Kingfishers\\" (or King Fishers)  Bert's Blues- Inspired by Bert Jansch, whose guitar style was a heavy influence on Donovan and wrote \\"Do You Hear Me Now\\" and \\"Oh Deed I Do\\" which Donovan already covered the previous year. He would often sing other Jansch songs like \\"Running From Home\\" in concert.  Season of the Witch- The most famous Donovan song that wasn't released as a single nor was it a Top 40 hit. Yet it remains a classic song about paranoia and could be drug-influenced but it was alluding to Donovan's upcoming drug bust (he was the first British pop star to be busted for drugs in London later that year).  The Trip- A double meaning song as the \\"Trip\\" was a nightclub on the Sunset Strip but there are also mentions of drug references including a vision of \\"Bob Dylan he sat the Mad Hatter\\". This was of course to get back at Dylan poking fun at Don in the 1965 documentary [[ASIN:B000KJU1HI Bob Dylan - Don't Look Back (1965 Tour Deluxe Edition)]]  Gunievere- perhaps he is comparing Linda with Gunievere of the royal court of Arthur....  The Fat Angel- While dedicated to Mama Cass who Don met at the Trip (a club also mentioned in the Peter Paul & Mary song \\"I Dig Rock & Roll Music\\" which namechecks both the Mamas and the Papas and Donovan along with the Beatles) it is more associated with Jefferson Airplane who are namechecked here and later recorded it themselves.  Celeste- A lovely ditty again inspired perhaps by Linda.  In all a great album but it took time to get released. The bonus tracks include two outtakes, early versions of \\"Museum\\" and \\"Superlungs\\" (the later retitled \\"Superlungs My Supergirl\\") and an extended version of the title song.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a movie for romantics--there's no other way to put it.  It is aesthetically amazing and the acting is top-shelf.  It does a wonderful job using the lines directly from the book but not making it 6 hours ;-)
B000MGUZM0|3.0|3 1/2      While not as outright anthemic as what will probably become an overshadowed beginning, AF ensure sophomore slump avoidance with this consistently solid follow up, filling in generic writing with subtle wisdom.
0307454541|2.0|I couldn't get past to horrible violence in this book.  I read somewhere the Swedish title is \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" and I think that would be a better title for this book.<br /><br />The back cover says this is a \\"love story\\"??  I must have missed something since there is no love in this book, only sex.  I'm not usually a prude but I got tired of Mikael Bloomkvist bedding every female character he encountered.
0671015206|5.0|This book is a classic. It shows how millionaires think and spend their time especially in dealing with their finances and investments.
0812973992|2.0|I am utterly bemused by the positive reviews this book has received. Cleary those who give this book more than one or two stars are seeing and experiencing the book through a different colored prism than I am. Only one novel was more completely unsatisfying than Let the Great World Spin, and that was Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance - but at least Mistry has some writing chops, has the ability to generate empathy and sympathy for his characters, talents of which Colum McCann is deeply bereft.     McCann utterly failed to fully flesh out his two central characters, Corrigan and Jazzlyn; he failed to create characters with depth and resonance. My favorite writers draw characters and create worlds for them to inhabit that stir my soul and imagination; they create people I can identify with, characters with motives I can understand even when I'm rooting against them. They create human beings who even when imperfect, deeply flawed, or evil, draw me into their psyches and then motivate me to understand them. McCann never achieves this with Corrigan and Jazzlyn. I never felt a sense of character intimacy with McCann's characters. I was glad to say goodbye to them. I Never sympathized with them. Compare McCann to Khaled Hosseini, who masterfully demonstrates what McCann doesn't in A Thousand Splendid Suns. When Mariam is forced to marry Rasheed, the older shoe cobbler from Kabul - a character as vicious a villain as Dicken's Fagin - I not only felt Mariam's pain, I simultaneously understood and sympathized with Rasheed. And while I could never forgive Rasheed's reprehensible behavior, I could appreciate the causal roots of his behavior, understand what drove him. I could identify with this despicable human being.    Compare McCann to Richard Russo. Russo is a master at creating characters who get inside you, a master at teasing humor from sadness (read Bridge of Sighs), a master at creating character intimacy and introducing you to people who live on in your imagination long after you've turned the last page of his books (read The Risk Pool). We can identify with Russo's characters because they so often evoke our own dashed hopes and dreams, highlight our own flaws and imperfections, and in so many ways reflect the longing, expectations, hopes, disappointments and failures of the collective American soul.      Let the Great World Spin is NOT a book I would ever recommend. I book I recently read and do recommend is This is Where I Leave You by Jonathan Tropper. A very different book, but one that becomes very enjoyable company.
B001BWTVMO|5.0|yes, this SHM edition from japan sounds better than the same remaster launched anywhere else...don´t expect miracles, just slightly better, more present, more defined.
0375842209|5.0|Read a chapter.  If you're not completely hooked by this beautifully written, beautifully imagined book, then you and I are made of different stuff.  TBT is extraordinary in every way.  It is epic tragedy rendered in human scale, a children's story that (should) resonate with every adult reader.  It is an important book, a gift to the literary imagination and a gift to memory.  MZ is a master of his craft.
B0018BXN4U|4.0|Look somewhere else, unless you like ultra bass, this K2 edition is full of boominess and lost into it, even worse is  the distorted Shout remaster. Best sounding mastering....to these ears, still is 1990s Atlantic cd.

B00386EZJU|5.0|We're in a Golden Age of animated motion pictures. When I was a kid growing up in the 1980s you got one, maybe two films from Disney in a calendar year, plus the odd independent movie like Watership Down or The Secret of NIMH, or some arty foreign language thing with bad dubbing, but that was about your lot. Since the Disney renaissance began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid the strength and popularity of the animated feature has grown exponentially, to the point where every major studio has its own animation department, well over a dozen full length feature animations are released each year, and companies like Pixar break box office records with apparent ease. The competition is fierce, but the Dreamworks studio seems to have managed the right blend of hip comedy and family-friendly action, spinning off from their massively successful Shrek series with hits such as Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar, and their 20th and most recent feature, How to Train Your Dragon.    Based on a popular children's book by Cressida Cowell, the film is a tale of Vikings and dragons, set on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. Hiccup, the son of the Viking chief Stoick the Vast, is a brainy outsider with a smart mouth, and would rather not grow up to fight dragons; he is a terrible embarrassment to his father, who in an attempt to `toughen up' the boy, sends to the dragon-fighting school of Gobber the Belch. However, rather than becoming the fearsome warrior his father intended, Hiccup inadvertently saves the life and befriends the dragon he was supposed to kill... The film stars the voice talent of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrara, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill, and is directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, who previously directed Lilo & Stitch for Disney in 2002.    Musically, Dreamworks Animation has been the sole domain of Hans Zimmer and his protégés from Media Ventures and now Remote Control since day one. Having alreadyworked on Antz, The Road to El Dorado, Chicken Run, Kung Fu Panda, and the original Shrek movie, English composer John Powell returns for a sixth time - although, ironically, the first time as a sole credited composer - and has written the best score for the studio since Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas back in 2003, and overall one of the best scores of his entire career.    The first thing I should point out is that, while he is clearly excellent at music, John Powell could do with brushing up on his geography a ltitle. Powell was obviously playing with the joke that the Viking adults in the film are voiced by Scottish actors - Butler and Ferguson - but may have taken it a step too far by injecting the music of the Highlands into his score too. Bagpipes skirl, whistles dance and fiddles fly in a manner unbecoming a noble Scandinavian gentlemen. It could be that Powell used a Swedish säckpipa or a Norwegian Hardanger fiddle and not one of their Celtic cousins from across the North Sea, but there is still a slight, if fleeting, geographical disconnect that occurs, causing a brief moment of puzzlement when the score first begins.    This small issue aside, the rest of How to Train Your Dragon is an absolute delight. The word which keeps springing to mind when listening to this music is `joyous'. It's music that wows you with stirring action sequences, touches you with more lyrical material, and slaps a big, silly smile on your face from the first cue to the last. John Powell seems to excel at animation scores more than any other type of film he attempts; the level of inventiveness in works such as Robots, the Ice Age series, and his work with Harry Gregson-Williams on Chicken Run and the Shrek series is obvious, but these scores sometimes have a schizophrenic everything-including-the-kitchen-sink approach that can make the album a disjointed affair, jumping from style to style and theme to theme seemingly at random. How to Train Your Dragon is not like that; it flows beautifully from start to finish as a cohesive listening experience, and as such is probably Powell's most satisfying work, in any genre, in years.    The opening cue, \\"This is Berk\\", introduces the three score's main themes. It begins with a noble horn performance of what eventually becomes the score's `flying theme', and segues into a sweet woodwind piece for Hiccup and his would-be girlfriend Astrid that recalls the more low-key moments of Chicken Run, before literally exploding into the first performance of the score's main theme, a rousing anthem for the entire orchestra and a male voice choir that is simply magnificent. The large orchestra/male voice choir/Scottish instruments combination heard here is basically the blueprint for the entire score, with some variation of one of more of these elements appearing in every cue. The main theme re-occurs regularly throughout the score, receiving notable recapitulations in cues such as \\"New Tail\\", \\"This Time For Sure\\" and \\"Astrid Goes For a Spin\\" to excellent effect. The tender piano performance of the theme in \\"Where's Hiccup\\" is magical.    The flying cues, where Hiccup takes to the skies on the back of his scaly friend Toothless, are exhilarating in the best possible way, with the astonishing \\"Test Drive\\" capturing the spectacular freedom of flight in no uncertain terms. The music in these cues swoops and dives, and opens into expansive statements of the flying theme which are quite thrilling, especially when the bagpipes and an electric guitar join the orchestra. Listening to this music, you can almost feel the wind in your hair, taking your breath away, as you wheel through the skies. Occasionally, in some of these more open moments, the score reminds me of Hummie Mann's vastly underrated score for Year of the Comet, and those few who are familiar with that excellent work will know what a compliment that is.    The action music is equally superb; energetic, tuneful, creative, and often featuring statements ofor more of the main themes. \\"Dragon Battle\\" has some fearsome low brass chords mixed in with propulsive, urgent rhythmic writing, providing the fire-breathing beasties with a sense of menace and danger. Later cues such as \\"The Downed Dragon\\", \\"Dragon Training\\", \\"Focus, Hiccup\\", \\"Dragon's Den\\", \\"The Kill Ring\\" and the astonishingly intense \\"Counter Attack\\" are no less entertaining, running the gamut of emotions, occasionally tense and nervous, occasionally downright threatening, but often embracing a free-wheeling, carefree vitality that is a pleasure to experience. In each of these cues, the power generated by the orchestra, and the way in which Powell orchestrates each section with such apparent ease, is outstanding.    The score is not all bombast and histrionics, though. \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" has a dreamy, almost New Age vibe, with an unusual tick-tock percussion element highlighting marimbas and xylophones, a breathy female vocalist, and even sleigh bells, which gradually reveals itself as a creative variation on the flying theme. \\"See You Tomorrow\\" is a toe-tapping Highland reel with fluttering pennywhistles forefronting several huge thematic performances, and is probably the closest Powell has come to recapturing the vitality of \\"Building the Crate\\" from Chicken Run in over a decade (still one of the highlight cues of his career). The romantic theme for Hiccup and Astrid, hints of which appear in the opening cue, is expanded in the glorious, sweeping \\"Romantic Flight\\", another one of the score's many high points.    The score's finale, from \\"Ready the Ships\\" through to \\"Coming Back Around\\", represents 20 minutes of the best action music of John Powell's entire career. \\"Ready the Ships\\" had a determined, expectant feeling, although the hocking male voice choirs and martial percussion hits do give way at one point to a more subtle, reflective sequence which is quite lovely. \\"Battling the Green Death\\" is utterly spectacular, and even has a sequence of Erich Wolfgang Korngold/Max Steiner-style swashbuckling adventure music which gives the cue a wonderfully nostalgic Golden Age feel. When Powell restates the flying theme at around the 4½ minute mark, and in the conclusive \\"Coming Back Around\\", the music absolutely soars.    Possibly the only misfire on the album is the song at the end of the album, \\"Sticks & Stones\\" by Jónsi, better known as Jón Þór Birgisson of the Icelandic rock band Sigur Rós. I like Sigur Rós, and having an actual Scandinavian artist contribute to the project makes sense, but the downbeat introspection and morose style of Birgisson's music seems even gloomier considering the nature of the music that preceded it.    It's very rare that one can listen to an entire 70+ minute album and honestly say that all of them have musical merit, but that is genuinely the case here. Usually scores of this length have a fair amount of filler, and would benefit from a bit of editorial pruning to get it down to 45-50 minutes, but on How to Train Your Dragon every cue has worth, either through a thematic restatement or a new and interesting texture. What I also like a great deal about this score is the clarity of its sound. Although for a great deal of the running time the entire orchestra is in play, in virtually every cue there is a moment where one specific instrument will come to the fore in a featured performance, just for a couple of bars; the opening cue alone has moments for clarinet and harp that are excellent. Later, in \\"The Dragon Book\\", a harpsichord pops up playing off brass triplets - and that's just one of literally dozens and dozens of moments throughout the score that make you sit up and take notice.    I'm running out of superlatives now, but I think I've made my point. How to Train Your Dragon is a 5-star score all the way, a fine example of modern film music which reaffirms my faith in John Powell. I have to admit that, in recent years, his Bourne Identity urban thriller style had started to trymy patience, and I was beginning to wonder whether the composer who impressed me so much at the turn of the millennium was ever going to come back. Thankfully, he has, and with a score which sets the benchmark for 2010 almost impossibly high. In an already crowded market it's an early contender for score of the year, and anyone who revels in old fashioned thematic orchestral writing will absolutely love it.

B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|Latter day hippie communes populated by aging white progressive types, led by an all-knowing \\"Prophet\\" who happens to be a black Rastafarian type, an Evil Corporation, a Luddite anti-tech POV...all of your old favorite politically correct memes in one place!  If that's not enough, you also get - wait for it, you'll be shocked - an evil conspiracy involving the US Military and the aforementioned Evil Corporation!  Who'da thunk it?  It gets even sillier from there.  The progressive black Rastafarian dude is actually a rich old white dude, and...well, as I said, it gets sillier.    There are decent enough special effects here and there but wholly unbelievable outdoor action sequences as this \\"futuristic\\" world is loaded down with brand new looking Ford Crown Victoria cop cars and lots of 2009 Chevrolets.  There is the occasional shiny new Toyota Pious as well, and fashion seems not to have changed at all from, oh, I don't know, yesterday.  This futuristic world is about as futuristic as your trip to the grocery last week.    I'd have given it three stars for overall entertainment value (I did actually stay awake, always a plus), but had to subtract a star for its pathetic adherence to politically correct formulae.  It's par for the course these days, but that course has become annoying, stale and tired.  I hope Hollywood figures this eventually.

Tobey is Sam, the athlete and the military man. Jake is Tommy, the ne'er do well, just out of prison, for what we never really know, Sam is sent to Afghanistan, again as one of his kids says, and is reported as dead. He is actually taken prisoner and undergoes traumatizing experiences as a prisoner of war.  Meanwhile at home, Grace as played by Natalie Portman moves on. She grieves, she has loved Sam since they were sixteen. She has two children to care for, and let me say at this point that they are the hit of the film. The emotions that they relate are magnificent and bring us to tears. Tommy while dealing with his demons tries to help Grace and the family. There is an attraction between Grace and Tommy, and then Sam comes home, damaged more mentally than physically,<br /><br />This is a film about the tragedies of war, What war does to the soul and to the lives of the soldiers. However, it feels half-finished. There are a lot of undercurrents and the real emotions are never examined.  The dysfunction of the family is hinted at, what happens to the soldiers who come home so damaged? This film could have been so much more.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Currently I've watch only 2 disc's and they are very well remastered (Personal opinion only). The 7.1 sound quality is a bit above average but is an improvement over the mono recording. I found the colors excellent and vibrant. I recommend this Blu-Ray to anyone who grew up watching the original series. I haven't purchased the Second or Third Season yet so I don't know about them. I would believe them to be as good as Season one. Overall on a scale of 1 - 10 I would give them an 8.5 and that's only because they are remastered.

B002OSY2T6|4.0|Great toy.  Works on carpet and moves on touch.  Music is fun and toy is entertaining.  Not sure about the mirror and why it is there but love the toy and so does my granddaughter.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Superbly entertaining!  EPIC!  Characters and the intricacies of the ancient myths are well expressed.  Brad Pitt is AMAZING, well-cast as Achilles.  Eric Bana is excellent as Hector, Diane Krueger is loveliness herself and Sir Peter O'Toole, while I thought him too 'white' for the part, is such a good actor that I forgot his paleness and was thoroughly taken in by his performance, as well as everyone elses, right down to the baby playing Hector's son.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is SPLENDID and well-researched too.  The costuming and sets are very close to the time period, inspiring, including an ingeniously designed Trojan horse.  The acting, screenwriting, cinematography, special effects, choreography, music, etc, are all excellent.<br /><br />While the actual war lasted some 10 years (hence the thousand ships), it's considerably condensed for the purposes of movie making and though the ending has been changed here, it's thoroughly engaging entertainment.<br /><br />** HIGHLY Recommend
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Foot of the Mountain is better than I expected--and I expect a lot from this crew!  Morten's voice is golden (as usual) and Pal & Mags back him up flawlessly.  \\"The Bandstand\\" is current and catchy; a perfect to get you going.  \\"Riding the Crest\\" breaks into a nice moving bassline and Morten nails the vocals.  \\"Foot of the Mountain\\" is classic A-ha style (circa East of the Sun) and features Morten's melodic voice and expert finesse.  Sunny Mystery is a little more electronic and upbeat, but not overdone.  \\"Start the Simulator\\" began with a catchy riff and then Morton comes in with a dark, almost droning, melody... but keep listening, it's by design. The song takes a different direction towards the end and the harmonies are very unique.  Finding the intricacies in this song will make it one of your favories.<br /><br />It's shameful the U.S. still has no clue this band has put out more than \\"Take on me\\".  A few other must-have A-ha albums are: East of the Sun, West of the Moon; Lifelines; Stay on these Roads; and Scoundrel Days.  If you love the vocals, pick up Morten Harket's two commercial solo albums (also available on Amazon.com): Wild Seed and Letter from Egypt.
0872860175|5.0|In my mind, this is the best poem written in the 20th century, with T.S. Eliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" bringing up a close second. With Howl, Ginsberg totally reinvented the way poetry was written, and you can clearly see this influence in the slam poets of today. Howl is both raw and reserved, for while it punches you in the face with graphic detail it holds back key emotional points that leave one questioning. This is a very emotional poem, but these emotional points that I speak of are left vague for a very important reason: so that every single reader draws their own conclusions and so the reader is forced to bring more of themselves into the poem. Like \\"The Wasteland\\", Howl is not a poem you can easily read in emotional detachment; for, if you do, you miss the key elements of the poem. But, if you are searching for a poem that will first drag you to the lowest of the low and then, gradually, slowly but surely, bring you back up to where you can finally see daylight again, this is the poem for you. It is a sad poem, but it is also a poem that has the ability to take a sufficiently imaginative person from the depths of suicidal depression (which I know) and bring them back to where they are able to function as some kind of human being again.    In short, this poem gets a bad rap, but it is essentially optimistic, although it starts off from a pessimistic viewpoint. If you look, the beauty is there; but if you approach it with preconceived judgments, you will most certainly not see the poem's bright side.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I just got this and just in time, I broke my last case this morning when I dropped my ipod yet again on my treadmill. The design is exactly what I wanted and needed all in one. I wanted a hard case, with a sturdy belt clip, and arm band that didn't require changing the case or taking it off. The band is more than large enough (I have kind of big arms) with room to spare in both directions. I like that the case protects the screen, without making clickwheel use difficult. The design really is exceptionally useful. My only slight unexpected detail is that the case sticks out farther from the arm band than I thought. I don't think it effects the use in any way, but I was just expecting it to lay a little flatter. They should add more pictures to the description. I don't intend to use the belt clip as a stand because I'm a little afraid of breaking it and need the clip more.     Bottom line, I couldn't have asked for better in terms of design quality. Someone was very thoughtful and careful when designing this making it useful and convenient. I run almost everyday and who wants to go back and forth changing the case? I've seen others boasting a belt clip that is really just 2 slits in the back for you to literally loop it through an actual belt or arm band. Who wants that pain in behind?
B0001XALTG|4.0|While this movie definitely shows how heroin can destroy lives, there is, in my opinion, too much humor. I would rather recommend Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\" Although Trainspotting is excellently directed, and I have no problems with the acting, the screenplay itself seems to make light of a very serious subject. If you've ever seen anyone suffer the rigors of drug addiction, you know that it can be a hideous thing, and there is just too much comic relief in this film. Maybe I have a sick sense of humor, but I was laughing for almost a quarter of the film, which is way too much for this genre. I have only watched \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" 3 or 4 times, and I don't know if I really want to ever watch it again. That's not because it's a bad movie, but it just left that strong of an impression on me. So, if you really want to see how much heroin, coke, and speed can royally f**ck up your life, buy \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" instead. It may not be pleasant, but sometimes the truth hurts, and I feel as though Trainspotting just candy coats the truth with an idealized picture of what addiction is like.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I normally wait to watch movies when they come out on Netflix, but I took a chance on this one and decided to pay my $4.99 and watch it on demand the day it came out.  I was moved, moved enough to want to own it and to buy it as a present for several other people too.  The fact that it was based on a true story, and that this wonderful family could not only change Michael's life, but that he could change there's is wonderful.  If you don't like happy endings, if you don't like heartwarming, see the good in people movies, then don't rent or buy this.  But if you still believe there is good in the world and want a real break from all the media nonsense the nere-do-wells are shoveling these days, then this movie is for you.  I though Sandra Bullock deserved the Oscar for her fine performance in this movie.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|Update December 2010: The previous Kindle version made frequent references to graphs, tables, diagrams and images that were not present (limiting its value), however there has just been an update that includes all this missing information. This updated review reflects that change.    This excellent book written by the intelligent and entertaining doctor and health communicator Ben Goldacre is a must read for anyone who has an opinion about any health issue you've seen, heard or read about in the media. Although written in the context of the UK, its lessons and advice apply to anyone anywhere.     Covering everything from complementary and alternative medicine (including chiropractic and homeopathy) to vaccinations to self-proclaimed \\"TV professors\\" to the pros & cons of the pharmaceutical industry, the author shows the reader both sides of the story, shows the evidence, and explains the problems. But these are not just his proclamations on the issues: he points to scientific papers, additional resources, metastudies, and sites like the brilliant Cochrane Collaboration. While some of it is about correcting the egregious falsehoods proclaimed by journalists and snake oil peddlers, it is mostly about arming the reader with the tools to determine for yourself whether a topic or a position is as described or worth further investigation. Critical thinking, logic and scepticism... skills that everyone needs, but most are lacking.     Everyone should read this book.

0307388921|5.0|What a great book; Chuck continues to touch my funny bone.  I wonder if Chuck is a little crazy himself, because he describes this cast of sex/alcoholics with such detail, you wonder how he gets the inside scoop.  I feel so close to the main character that I \\"understand\\" why he chooses to make part of his living by choking in upscale restaurants and have people save him.  I see no moral problem with this, because he is giving them the idea that they really made a difference and for once in their lives they were heroes.  So what if the main character, Victor, sometimes asked for a little help or if he accepted birthday cards from those who saved him.<br />Victor did all this because he had recently dropped out of medical school and had to foot the bill of a nursing home for his dying mother.  He justified his actions in such a way that you could not help but to cheer for him.<br /><br />Along the way you get a glimpse into his addictive sexaholic life and his exploits in some of the most bizarre places.  It makes you wish you had the guts to do the things he pulls off; are there really people like this?  You will have all the questions you have about sex addicts answered in this book, and make you think about joining a support group in hopes that you may meet some people that Chuck describes.<br /><br />Another choice part of the book that I loved was Victor's best friend and how he chooses collecting rocks instead of acting out in a sexual life.  It is a classic exchange of one addiction for another.  I see part of this in myself as I choose running mile after mile so I don't drink beer after beer.<br /><br />Finally the most important aspect of the book is Victor's journey to find out what was written in his Mother's diary, which may unlock the mystery of his Father.  Along the way Victor befriends a Doctor at the nursing home, who just happens to read Italian (language his Mother's diary is wrote in), and she tells him that he was spawned of the reconstructed DNA from a religious relic of Christ himself (DNA from Jesus' foreskin).<br /><br />Victor doesn't want to admit that he really is a good guy, and one who brings a lot of joy to other peoples' lives.  Victor could be found accepting blame from all kinds of patients at the nursing home, and even though he was just trying to get them to leave him alone or to shut them it, he unwittingly gave them closure and comfort at such a vulnerable time in life.  He still is convinced that he is just a screwed up person making his way through life, however just when he is about to accept it, he finds out a tragic truth right at the time of his Mother's death.  He finds out that his Doctor friend was in fact a patient and crazy.  Victor really is not the child of Jesus.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for a light read that will make you feel good and give you a fun voyeur look into addicts' lives.

0143038419|3.0|Few of us can do what this author did.  Take a whole year off traveling and living off of supposed money that a book was suppose to generate.  She divorces her husband on unknown grounds of supposedly being 'bored' and goes into another affair with another guy without thought and now is depressed because it too doesn't work out.  She is working on her spirtuality which helps because honestly there is fundamentally something amiss in her soul and spirit for her to do these destructive things to herself.      The author's voice in this story is very down to earth and easy to relate to.  It's just a bitty depressing even though this author seems to be living the 'high life' of traveling as she pleases and enjoying her 'time off' for a year.  All in all, a good read but somewhat painful and long in some areas.  I had difficulties with the 2nd chapter and it's taking me a long time to get through chapter 3 because at this time it's not that interesting to me now.

B0000025VU|5.0|Mark Knoffler returned on this 1983 album 4 years after playing on on Dylan's first Gospel album, Slow Train Coming.  For me the best are first rate and the rest not memorable.  What Jokerman is all about is unclear to me, but it just flows with the Dylan wordplay and excellent production standards, I just love it.  Sweetheart Like You is a slower number which goes down well with me, License To Kill is another winner and finally I And I, Dylan puts in another class performance.  In 1984 I saw an outdoor Dylan concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Santana was the main support act, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton made cameo appearances.  If he is the Jokerman, he normally has the last laugh !
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I don't know where to start with this review.  First I want to say that I can't believe a band this awesome will not be making any other albums after this.  I just couldn't believe it when I read about it.  Bands like Scorpions need to be around and make true rock music!  We need this more than ever!!  It's so heartbreaking to know this.  I really hope they will change their minds and continue on.<br /><br />Also, I have to say that I really love the album cover, it's so creative!<br /><br />Now on to the review.  I won't review every song but one main point that needs to be mentioned first is the guest appearance of the Finnish symphonic metal singer Tarja Turunen (Nightwish), in the song \\"The Good Die Young.\\"  When I first read she was featured on this song, before I even heard the album, you have no idea how excited I got and I downloaded that song immediately before buying the entire album.  I even got a radio edit version, it's such an amazing and beautiful ballad that has such incredible musicianship.  I only wish Tarja sang lyrics but to just hear her vocalizing in the background is so awesome!!  I love how Tarja is working with artists like Doro Pesch and Scorpions lately, whom of all I love!  The other ballads are amazing as well, like \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Sly.\\"<br /><br />The rockers are so amazing as well!  \\"No Limit\\"  is probably my favorite rocker on here, it really rocks and it's an awesome song to listen to while driving!  I just love this album so much and cannot recommend it enough!  It really sounds so 80's and any Scorpions fan should be getting it!!

B00284BMBM|5.0|I absolutely love these songs! I play them over and over and never get tired of listening to them. One of my favorite songs, the Ghost of Me, tops the list. I can't help but sing along with the music. They inspire me!
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I was really excited when I heard they had a new album out. But I wasn't expecting too much, as they have been around for so long, and a lot of bands end up releasing mediocre albums eventually. But, this band has lost nothing with age. This is as good as any of their best albums. Great rockers, great ballads... I can't believe the singer is 61, he sounds the same as he always did. This album is just great. I don't see why any Scorpions fan wouldn't like this.
0307271862|5.0|This is my first Henning Mankell book (have seen the tv movies) and it certainly will not be my last. It grabbed me and I read it in two days, he is an excelent writer that keeps the reader engaged and curious, although the historical Chinese background gets a little heavy at times. Swedish Judge Brigita Roslin is not a profesional investigator, police nor a detective and she sort of \\"stumbles\\" into her discoveries while trying to save her marriage, yet I found her an engaging and believable character.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|The first time I saw this was when it first came out, and I loved it so much that I asked the screening room managers if I could have a copy of the poster, which they obligingly gave to me.    I was very young.    Now, having grown in knowledge and sophistication, I watched it again for the first time since then, and the best I can say is this:    It is a nice introduction to Austen-on-film for a young romantic, a good bridge, perhaps, from \\"Clueless\\" to the BBC, but it mostly suffices as a Regency-period fashion show for Ms. Paltrow, in all her swan-necked posings.  Her acting, however, is inferior to that of her co-stars as well as to the source material, but for that I blame the direction more than the actress.    What I find especially baffling is that, having previously read all of Austen, I liked this film adaptation at all, but I suppose I was caught up in the Hollywood glamour and likewise all too happy to uncritically embrace anything remotely Austen.  It is very pretty to look at, but basically unsubstantial and as Austen, quite unsatisfying.
B000002MZ6|5.0|The music on this album is astounding in its beauty!  I had the cassette years ago, and forgot how much I was missing.  This music intertwines the beauty of nature with human longing for home.  I once used one of the tracks for a ballet dance that I was to perform.  Perfect music for my dance.  I never get tired of listening!  The music is complex, but soothing.  This could have been a great soundtrack to the recent movie \\"Avatar.\\"

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for movies that have already had so much response, but I can't help it.  I totally agree that if you can see the 3D version, do it now before all theaters quit showing it.  I saw the 3D version 3 time and regular 2D once.  My only regret is that I didn't get to see the I MAX version.  I kept my glasses and used them each time, and hope that the 3D DVD comes out soon.  Anything less would be a slight disappointment, but once the movie starts, even 2D keep you captured during the whole experience.  Repeating previous reviewers advice, Use The Restroom Before The Movie, you won't have time once the movie starts.  Even the beginning is not slow, when the whole idea is being introduced.  Sam Worthington did a wonderful job of showing his human and Na'Vi side.  His character development, and his speech to gather clans was superb.  I would go the the theater now and watch again if there was one nearby.  Being Christian did not hinder my enjoyment.  Their Mother was created by someone. Loved the surprise assistance from the \\"Dangerous\\" animals of the planet.
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|I liked the visuals, It was like watching an impressionist painting at times. However, the plot was very screwed up. The Dad served only to eat up screen time and add confusion. The ending was pretty abrupt and anticlimactic. They spend the whole movie building suspense about ponyos mother, and setting her father up as the villan, only to have it nd with the dad basically \\"yes dear\\"ing as a form of plot resolution. I think one of the problems(and a constant problem with alot of the directors movies) is that they were trying to shoehorn to much plot into to small a length of time. IMO this would have been alot better as a short run tv series, they would have had more time to properly explore the kids relationship, both fathers relationships to their kids, etc.

1439190275|5.0|You do not have to be obese to realize value from this latest book highlighting the nutritional philosophy of the late Dr. Robert Atkins. How anyone can believe comments about this way of eating as \\"dangerous\\", or \\"unhealthy\\", must have read a different version than the one I purchased and read. The message I take away from my version is to avoid such things as trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, refined sugar, and grains that have been refined to the point that all that remains is fit only for use as wall paper paste. These and other \\"franken-foods\\" have been given to us by people with letters both in front of and after their names, so forgive me if I am not impressed when such an \\"expert\\" seeks to convince me that eating lots of nutritional whole foods is dangerous simply because it is occasionally consumed with a serving of delicious and healthy lean meat.  Anyone; fit or not, overweight or not, cannot but benefit by eating this way.   I found this book to be well written, easy to follow and the authors obviously went to great lengths to explain the science behind their position.  If the question were simply \\"is this book of any value?\\"; my answer to that is, \\"what are you waiting for, do something good for yourself: Read the book, get healthy.\\"

0439023491|5.0|At the conclusion of CATCHING FIRE two words entered my head \\"Wow\\" and \\"Really?\\" Then I caught my breath, checked my heart and re-read the final chapter because I'd been so engrossed in finding out how Suzanne Collins was going end this unpredictable ride that I'd really only scanned the words the first time through. Not many books have the ability to leave me breathless and on that note not many books surprise me anymore either. Catching Fire managed to do both and what a fantastic time I had.<br /><br />Starting soon after Katniss's victory in the Hunger Games we re-join her back in district 12. Now a reluctant celebrity of sorts Katniss no longer has to worry about money or feeding her family however things are far from perfect. At odds with both Gale and Peeta there is unrest and change brewing in Panem, old rules are being reinforced amid rampant rumours of a rebellion against the capital. A revolt Katniss and Peeta may have unwittingly started but are certainly being accredited for. As the pair make plans for the upcoming Victory Tour and the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games a visit from President Snow contains a grave warning, forcing Katniss to publicly reaffirm her love for Peeta as well as trying to find a way to stop the desired but deadly and growing civil unrest.<br /><br />Of course this is just the first half of the book (and the boring half too) Once the President decides on his form of revenge you simply won't believe what happens and then you won't be able to put the book down. I wondered how Collins was going to be able to trump the excitement of the Hunger Games well she does ten-fold and I never knew what was going to happen next. Full of surprises, innovative themes and fantastical creatures, we also get violence, heartbreak, page tearing suspense and a healthy dose of politics. The pace never lets up, making up for the weak and wandering part 1 where I felt like Collins was never really sure of where to take her story, giving us one possible direction before heading off in another. Silly me this was undoubtedly her intention all along letting me think I knew where she was going before she finally gives us...Wow.<br /><br />Events have now been set up brilliantly for the third and final instalment; MOCKINGJAY due Aug 2010 and I can't wait.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I enjoyed this version of Ms. Austen's book.  I went back and reread it after watching the dvd. The ending is changed but I liked this version, too. It was as if Miss Anne Elliot had decided enough is enough and finally took action.  I enjoyed the casting choices as well.  Sally Hawkins is excellent and I enjoyed the humour of various other cast members.  Definitely worth watching.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I thought this cd was one of the most well written (lyrically) albums I've heard for a long time. She no doubt deserves every grammy but her written is so well written. Highly recommened for younges in college who like something to play when their partner is around..

If you're a sucker for romantic comedies, thrilling adventure, an oft told tale told with an interesting new twist, Star Dust is for you.  I saw it three times in theaters, and now have seen it a like number of times in the weeks following its purchase.  Casting is spot on, no false notes for any of the actors selected for any of the roles.  This includes even the smallest speaking part.  So buy it rent it and enjoy a couple of hours with friends you hadn't known you had.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|It's amazing how much the food industry has changed just in the past 40-50 years.  I knew that farms were factory-like, but I really didn't know that it had gone to the extent that it has.<br /><br />I wish everyone could see this video so they would know what is being done to make food cheapest and fattest, and what is put into the food that they eat.  I think if the public was more aware of processes and origins of their food, they could make better choices, and vote with their money to buy less factory-like made food until some of these processes and procedures were no longer profitable.<br /><br />As I watched these factories where animals spend their entire lives packed in so tight to each other that they can hardly move and they hang out all day in their own urine and feces, where it's impossible to clean the waste out due to the packed conditions .... I wondered how in the heck could any of these animals be truly 'healthy', and how does it benefit people to eat an unhealthy animal?  A lot of the animals we eat are sick!  How can that be good???<br /><br />I was also astonished at the lack of control that some farmers have over their own farms, and at how corn works in America.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone.

0691142165|3.0|This book has impressive background research, and provides numerical analysis that could be very useful for further study of financial crises. However, it is written in a dry style that makes it a slog to read.  For the most part, the conclusions supported by the research are hardly surprising.  I suppose that I should have expected that from the title.  It is a worthwhile book, and I am glad to have it in my library for future reference, but I cannot recommend it for pleasure reading.
B001684L0A|3.0|This is a wonderful story; however, the disk behaves poorly.  There are times that we cannot even watch it.  I am terribly disappointed in the quality.  Our blu-ray machine is new so I cannot believe that is the problem.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|Watched it and wasn't very impressed. It was taken from a 30 min or less 70's TV show called the Twilight Zone which dealt with weird and whacky short ideas/stories that writers came up with. How to take one of those short stories, that by definition of being short does not have a lot of background details or a significant \\"plot\\", and turn it into a hollywood movie? Well, the answer appears to be that this particular director could not. There were holes in the story and overall it just didn't make much sense.<br /><br />Give it a miss, you won't regret it.

B0031ZWZR2|5.0|About the Set:<br />Barring the fact that this is only half a season of a show (you get 10 episodes - not exactly what I call happiness but a nice way to get a show fix), it is a nice little set to pick up. You can get an idea of what the show is about, if you like it or not, and if you want to continue with the season.<br /><br />The Show Idea:<br />For a little over 2 minutes, the people experience a blackout that seems to impact everyone. During that time, 20 million people die, a number or injuries occur, and people are left wondering why. What's more, most people experience around 2 minutes and 17 seconds of a Flash Forward and see what will happen to them on a specific day in April. Some people see happiness, some see revelations and infidelity, and some see other things. Some see nothing, however, and quickly come to think that they may have no future. This action leads the government to wonder a lot of things, amely if we were attacked and if it will happen again. This leads us to our main cast of characters, to a group of people that seem to have some sinister reasons behind their actions, and to the revelation that a man was caught on video not blacked out.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />I personally found the first ten episodes captivating when reviewed on DVD, and can say that the next two episodes on TV keep up the action. The acting in the show is top notch and a lot of people - both known and unknown - appear here. This leads to some seasoned actors showing off some really great performances and keeping my attention. Even the kids in the show - two main ones thusfar - have been great. They show the correct emotions and one of them seems frightened by something she will not talk about.<br /><br />The idea of the show is great as well. The Flash Forwards themselves are like a gargantuan web and, when strung, they seem disconnected and odd. One epissode shows just how many that are reported, however, with a website being put up by the government and over 9 million postings being shown. When a lot of these are put together they give you an idea that something big is going on and that one man is the key to everything. It also shows you that the main people are not the saints they may want to be, that the future can be interesting for the FBI and others, and that people are confused by what happened. Combine this with the questions (1) will it happen again and (2)can the future be changed (you get an idea about both of these) and you have yourself a show.<br /><br />Would I buy this? Yes if you want it now. You know a bigger set will come later BUT having it now has been nice. I saw a number of things I wanted to revisit here on the DVD and, honestly, I like having it without interruption. I also like the show a lot, wondering about the people with no future, the crows, the thing that happened in 1991, and so on.<br /> Hopefully this review helps to explain things and tell you if you need the show or not. I personally liked it, even if it was only 10 shows.a lot of these are put together they give you an idea that something big is going on and that one man is the key to everything.

B001OQCV6K|3.0|This incarnation of SHERLOCK HOLMES should be an excellent movie.  I enjoy all the actors, and most of the acting is very good.  They characters they portray are engaging and have nice chemistry.  The plot is decent, if a little worn.  The costumes are lovely and the recreation of 19th century London is outstanding.  Even the score is very nice.  Taken individually each of these elements appears to succeed.  So why is SHERLOCK HOLMES so much less than the sum of its parts?<br /><br />In my opinion, the cinematography, the writing, and the direction bring SHERLOCK HOLMES down.  The cinematography is dark and dim; the sun never shines.  At times, it is hard to see what is going on.  The perpetual storm over London stops any of the lovely costumes from popping.  Basically, SHERLOCK HOLMES is boring to look at.  The writing doesn't help either.  While the plot is entertaining, it is similar to many recent plots, including Dan Brown's current novel or one of The Librarian movies.  Not really worthy of SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Lastly, the direction really fails SHERLOCK HOLMES.  The film lacks suspense where it should be brimming with it.  It is a very one dimensional film, devoid of depth and substance, completely superficial.  The audience is never enveloped by the story.  And for some reason, the director allows Robert Downey, Jr. to mumble throughout.  RDJ is a better actor than that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like SHERLOCK HOLMES, but the misdirection and lack of execution left me with a very lukewarm impression overall.  It was very nice to see this SHERLOCK HOLMES hearken back to its roots in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and not the old Basil Rathbone films), but it just wasn't enough to get me excited.  And I wanted to be excited.  I hear that a second film is in the works.  I will probably see it, but with a little trepidation.  Let's hope that they can make the necessary improvements to make the next SHERLOCK HOLMES the outstanding movie that it should be.

1593083661|1.0|I give this a one-star only for the introduction.  The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic.  However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating.  If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti.  I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc.  It wasn't until later that I read the introduction.  Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis.  If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition.  If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition.  Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition.

0978053583|5.0|As of yet, I am on the third lesson, each one taking a week. I cannot yet tell you of all the glories that I have manifested.  However, I am in fact trusting that this IS The Key. I have studied psychology as a professional for decades, am an expert in various areas including cognitive therapy and relaxation therapies, and am certified in EFT and hypnosis. I use these modalities for myself, and also engage in religious and esoteric practice and thought. Charles Haanel's slim volume is the first to explain the WHY and HOW STEP by STEP. It involves firstly control of the physical body, and that having been mastered, proceeds. It is serious, scholarly, and well-ordered. It describes the nature of thought,and the 2 centers of thought, the brain and solar plexus. It is the first manuscript that I have seen outside of Hindu works identifying the solar plexus as the seat of will. One systematically develops control over the conscious and the subconscious mind.  The conscious directs the subconscious, which provides the power. My one criticism is that Mr. Haanel does not get specific methods for stopping thoughts or for ridding oneself of negative thoughts. However, my own background in professional and self-help methodologies works well here. I am working with a small group.  We use conversation with mutual support, NLP, EFT and Michael Losier's version of LOA with contrast, clarity and allowing. Additionally, we do Nichiren Buddhist chanting which provides for personal prayers and the granting of personal desires. Working with the Master Key System requires effort and courage.[[ASIN:0446199745 Law of Attraction: The Science of Attracting More of What You Want and Less of What You Don't]][[ASIN:044654504X Law of Connection: The Science of Using NLP to Create Ideal Personal and Professional Relationships]][[ASIN:B00006497C SLOW GONGYO NICHIREN DAISHONIN BUDDHIST MEDITATION CD]][[ASIN:1604150300 The EFT Manual (EFT: Emotional Freedom Techniques)]]
B0035OTPEK|4.0|I give this 4 stars because it didn't knock me down at first listen like their past albums. That doesn't mean this isn't a good offering though.

0140120416|5.0|I have made many half hearted attempts over the years to learn Russian using several cassette and workbook type courses, but I lost interest in them quickly.  After taking a brief two month intensive classroom course, I found this book and decided to give it a try based on other good reviews.  I am very glad I did.    Perhaps because the chapters are organized in a manner similar to the language textbooks I remember from school, I found this book easy to follow and very suited to my own personal learning style.  The sections in each chapter are short, and I have found that I can do one or two sections each night without being overwhelmed.  Vocabulary lists at the beginning of each chapter are useful for vocabulary building.  Noun declension and inflected endings were the most difficult concepts for me to grasp in the classroom, but thanks to the straightforward manner in which they are presented in this book, I am quickly coming to terms with not only how they work but also when and how to use them properly.     That being said, I agree with other reviewers who mention the need to hear the spoken language in order to acquire proper pronunciation, but there are resources out there online that can be downloaded, not to mention Russian language movies available even on Netflix!      For me, the key to learning is to stay interested enough to be able to continue practicing regularly.  Each chapter here builds on the previous one just enough to make me feel like I am learning and making progress with each lesson.  I also enjoy how the dialogues show easy to use and understand examples of the points introduced in each chapter. It is also nice to see how exceptions to the rules are introduced and demonstrated in a relatively painless fashion.    If you are looking for serious grammar and vocabulary help in a fairly straightforward format, by all means give this course a try.

B00275EGX8|3.0|This film seemed contrived and laughably absurd. OK, my standards were set a bit high after viewing the remarkably good HBO effort: \\"Generation Kill\\". Having served in the military, the latter accurately portrays the manipulation of innocents into gung-ho ate-up soldiers followed by a hard dose of reality and later reflection. I was fortunate to have just missed Viet-Nam by a few years. As an example, when I finished USAF boot-camp we had guys buying jackets emblazoned with hyper-macho stuff like \\"Death from Above\\". We were a bunch of youngsters trained to fold underware precisely and follow detailed instructions.

I don't want to give anything away in regards to the plot because this really is one of those movies that will be more effective the less you know about it. But for those who like the the Twilight Zone and even Lost, this one will be right up your alley as it is a very effective, creepy thriller.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|i believe this is the best season of the show SEASON 6TH !!!   this is where everything stars and will end ...    i know this show it might be confuse for some people but is not IT REALLY make sense I know they are some people dont like it cause  they are not into tbis show  to watch it  just because is too confuse but is not .... it will really will make sense at the end.     but to me this show is  a unique show and one of the best shows  ever to watch  it really got my attention to it , I cant wait till the end of this show I heard some rumors that the end it will be sad but it will make sense to everything.

B00003CXD0|4.0|Although he has won plenty of acclaim--including two other Leading Actor Oscars and five Golden Globes--Dustin Hoffman was never better than he was as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. (He was equally good in a very different role as Raymond Babbitt in [[ASIN:0792833260 Rain Man]].) Playing an actor (or actress!) who is playing another role is never easy, yet he handles the multiple layers brilliantly. The scenes between Hoffman and Sydney Pollack (who also directed) are the best part of the film, probably due in large part to their very real off-camera arguments.  This film also boasts the right amount of Bill Murray (not too much!), allowing him to make the most of his scenes. Jessica Lange won Best Supporting Actress for what was in my opinion a fairly shallow role (Teri Garr deserved it more!), and yet Tootsie lost out on EVERY other Oscar that year, mostly to Ghandi and E.T.<br /><br />Minus one star for the soundtrack which was awful at the time and has aged no better.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|Starting with an epilogue by Dr Sheehan, we walk the life of the book through the eyes of U.S Marshal Edward Daniels (Teddy) who was called to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane woman on an island that's set up to contain those who are criminally insane. Without much help from the director, it appears that there is more to the case of the missing woman and the existence of the hospital than there really is.<br /><br />It is a fast pace book, with things happening one after another and another, leaving me breathless at times and unable to put down the book willingly. So, thankfully, it was a pretty short book compared to some of those I have been reading recently. what kept the reader going is the constant mini-cliffhangers and twists in the plot that sometimes makes you come up going \\"what the.... how?!?!\\"<br /><br />Even at the end, you wonder what is real, what happened there but you will be left with only your own theories and answers (thus my 4 stars, rather than a 5), because the author isn't about to easily explain answers away for the reader.<br /><br />If you like psychological thrillers (and this one became a movie with just about everything intact from the book), this is the one for you - but don't expect clear and clean answers at the end of the book or you will be left feeling terribly frustrated.

B001UV4XWY|5.0|Richmond, Virginia, 1976: A mysterious cardboard box turns up on the front door step of middle-class American couple, Arthur and Norma Lewis (James Marsden and Cameron Diaz). It holds an innocuous wooden box topped with a button secured under a glass dome. The couple are initially befuddled by it's presence until the appearance of the enigmatic Mr Steward (Frank Langella), who offers them a most bizarre choice: if they push the button, they will receive one million dollars tax free but, as a result, the button will take the life of someone they don't know. Arthur and Norma, despite their apparent affluence, are struggling financially - but can they really take Steward's offer seriously? And if so, can they really put a price on a human life?     \\"Donnie Darko\\" alumnus Richard Kelly's third film, \\"The Box\\", takes the central conceit of Richard Matheson's short story, \\"Button, Button\\" (previously adapted as an episode of the resurrected \\"Twilight Zone\\" in the eighties) and uses it to weave one of the most ambiguous, suggestive and deeply satisfying films that I've ever seen and restores my faith in him as a director (something I'd previously lost after the messy farrago of his sophomore effort, \\"Southland Tales\\").     \\"The Box\\" is undoubtedly Kelly's most deeply personal film to date. I thought the characters of Frank and Norma were far more interesting than the usual stock sketches that populate this kind of film, and was pleasantly surprised to discover, whilst watching the extras on the DVD, that this is because they are based on Kelly's parents: Kelly's father, its turns out, really did work on the Viking Lander missions and his mother was genuinely afflicted by the ailment that afflicts Diaz' character in the film. But \\"The Box\\" is far more than just a love letter to his parents; It is also an homage to the classic Watergate-era paranoid conspiracy thrillers/science fiction movies. If you're a fan of films like Philip Kaufman's [[ASIN:B000QQJ3Q0 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)]], Alan J. Pakula's [[ASIN:B00000IRE9 The Parallax View]], Bryan Forbes' [[ASIN:B00005ASOL The Stepford Wives (Silver Anniversary Edition)]] and Nicolas Roeg's [[ASIN:B00007JMCX The Man Who Fell to Earth (Special Edition)]],  you'll notice myriad stylistic and aesthetic references to those films and others of that genre. In many ways the pairing of Matheson and Kelly is a match made in conspiracy heaven as Kelly, like Matheson, really excels when he pricks an audience's sense of unease by hinting at dark worlds populated by mysterious strangers and sinister organisations that function just below the banal surface of everyday life.     As with it's spiritual predecessor, \\"Donnie Darko\\", Much in this film is suggested and vaguely alluded too rather than made explicit and, as with Kaufman's \\"Body Snatchers\\", even the most innocuous background details begin to take on a sinister import (American bicentennial footage featuring the twin towers of the world trade centers playing on a television in a scene seem to suggest that the sinister machinations of the box's owners have played out ominously in the future). Kelly brilliantly captivates the audience's attention whilst working their nerves with his juxtaposition of the mundane and strange. There are moments in this film which are positively Lynchian.     Performances are excellent and unexpected: James Marsden is an actor who I'd written off following a couple of deeply unmemorable turns in the generally execrable \\"X Men\\" movies and Cameron Diaz is an actress who I'd mentally relegated to a file marked \\"humourous eye-candy\\", but to give both leads their due, they really do knock the ball out of the park here. However, the star of this show really is Frank Langella, whose turn as the ambiguous Mr. Steward is a masterclass in understatement. I can't discuss his performance without ruining many of the twists and turns of this film, but I will say that such is the strength of his performance that I found myself coming to empathise with a character with whom one should really feel no empathy.    To my mind \\"The Box\\" is a masterpiece for the same reason that William Freidkin's \\"The Exorcist\\" is a masterpiece: it took an abstract concept and treated it in a way that is simultaneously surreal, suggestive and grittily rooted in a sense of the everyday and yet still managed to make me buy into it's reality.     I very much doubt that I'll see a better film this year and I recommend it unreservedly.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|The show is entertaining and addictive. The interaction of the characters is what makes this show a must see. The two lead characters work together to solve white collar crimes, one is FBI, the other is former (or maybe still practicing) criminal on a work release. There is a light touch of comedy in their interaction with each other. They both work well together and are learning the perspective of the 'other side' from each other as they solve the crime. Both characters have appeal. Neal easily stretches the rules to get what he wants, Peter goes by the rules. But you can see Peter working on Neal to keep things legal, and Neal's pushing Peter towards the boundary edge of the rules. Peter is likable, very clever, by the book, knows a lot about Neal and is good at figuring out what Neal is up to. Neal is clever and has his own agenda that he conceals from Peter (or does he?), which is part of a story arc mystery for the first season. These two, Neal and Peter, respect each other, and work as partners, but the game is on between them. You are also treated to gorgeous shots of New York that make a beautiful backdrop when these guys go outside. I rewatched these episodes many times because its that good.
0786868724|5.0|It is through blurry eyes that I say, for me this is the best of Mitch Albom's books - the most touching, most insightful, and most beautiful in proclaiming in two wonderful parallel stories (one of a Rabbi, and one of a Black, ex-druggy Preacher) what we all want to know: \\"What is Life all about?\\" I cannot do this book justice in a review, and must just summarize by saying: If you only read one book this year, please let this be the one.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|While the watch has gone out of sync with the current time a few times , 98% of the time its perfect. I love the band. I've had this watch almost a year now and I figured Id give it a quick review.  This is the best watch I have ever owned.<br /><br />Edit: 3/28/11 a ~year after my review and it still kicks butt, I love this watch!!!
0525421033|5.0|I expected the overall tone to be sad, but while the author doesn't hide from the tremendous loss that is at the core of this story, and there are moments of searing grief, it wasn't a depressing novel. It is really a story about life, and about the myriad experiences -- and connections with others -- that make up our lives.    I was blown away by the richness of the characters in this short novel. The author didn't waste any words. Every line was focused on animating the people in Mia's life -- her brilliant, devoted parents, her quirky grandma, her quiet but deeply loving, compassionate grandpa, her beloved brother, her best friend Kim, who's quiet, bookish, and stronger than anyone suspects, and her boyfriend Adam, who has been torn between his passion for his music and his devotion to Mia.    The connection between Mia and Adam is wonderful -- we get a few windows into their relationship, but what we see is multi-layered, rich and satisfying. We see the excitement and awkwardness of the beginning of a relationship between teens, as two people tentatively learn to fit their lives together. We saw their passion and tenderness and also the tensions that ran through their relationship.    The vibrant and utterly believable way the relationships in this story were drawn was really was made it shine. Gayle Forman has a gift for concise yet radiantly vivid writing and for illuminating the things -- large and small -- that really matter in life.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Eight years after their disappearance, one time Boston vigilantes Murphy and Connor McManus (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery), are living a life of quite pastoral solitude in rural Ireland with their father, 'Il Duce' (Billy Connolly). However, their life in exile is rudely interrupted when they receive word that a priest in Boston has been murdered using their signature 'two in the back of the head and pennies over the eyes' method. Disgusted by this slur on their 'mission', the brothers head back to Boston armed to the teeth and with vengeance on their minds - but unbeknownst to the brothers, forcing their return is just the first step in an audacious plan initiated by an old enemy...    If you enjoyed Troy Duffy's original \\"Boondock Saints\\", then I fail to see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel, as it really is more of the same albeit with a slightly expanded canvas. Like the first film, it is consistently enjoyable, even if it doesn't entirely work all of the time. Why some fans have taken such umbrage at it, I've no idea; I can only assume that the original has become so much of a cult film in the ten years since it's release that it has been blown out of all proportion in some people's minds.     Myself personally, I enjoyed every Garth-Ennis-styled minute of the sequel. Sure, like the original, its nowhere near being the most perfect movie ever made, but I was entertained throughout because, lets face it, its vastly more entertaining than most of the mainstream action fare being made by big budget studios. That and it had an ending that left me genuinely desirous of a third film.     I say ignore the naysayers and make up your own minds about this one.

B0035KGWR2|5.0|I couldn't imagine a follow up CD could be just as good or better than \\"This Is the Life\\", but \\"A Curious Thing\\" is so fantastic.  Her debut was great, but I don't know, this may be better.  I can't stop listening to it.  The sound is basically the same and the lyrics are sincere and shows just how good of a songwriter Amy is.  The band deserves a round of applause.  The piano player is awesome--especially tracks like \\"Pretty Face\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me That It's Over.\\"  It's so wonderful listening to an album that doesn't sound like everything else on the airwaves.  She's unique and has her own sound.  She is herself.  That's why we all buy her music.  There is not one bad song on this CD.  If you can get your hands on the Switzerland or Finland import, it is well worth the price for the bonus track \\"Young Lovers.\\"  Only Amy MacDonald would give us bonus tracks and B sides that could be the next single.  Did I mention this lady is brilliant?!!
0446698342|5.0|As soon as I started reading this book I decided I couldn't stop. The main reason I like Nicholas Sparks' books is that I like to read about love and not in a way that makes me feel unconfortable. As a man I feel comfortable reading his books because it's more like real life and not fantasy romance. The Lucky One was another one of his books that does this very well along with the multiple views he uses to tell the story which were great.
0316069906|3.0|If you have read the works of Michael Pollan, much of this will look familiar; if you have read Foer's previous works (fictional, yes, but with historical roots), you will recognize his particular spin on things and the touchstones common to Holocaust survivors. Perhaps my feelings about this work has something to do with the trappings of this particular form of Jewish Guilt perfected by those from New York (my parents included), or maybe it is being middle-aged and seeing the difference between youthful intelligence and learned wisdom, but in the end, it is mostly \\"preaching to the choir\\": like an atheist arguing with a rabbi about the existence of God, neither is going to be convinced of *anything* at the end of the argument.     Educational, but not as satisfying as his fiction.

0545123267|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. The plot sounded unique and sexy. But the beginning of the story wasn't introduced very well and it was hard for me to get into even after 100+ pages. Reading Shiver became a chore and I just wanted to get it over with.     I found most of the characters to be extremely boring, stereotypical teenagers except for Sam. I wanted to cringe every single time it was Grace's turn to tell her perspective. She was really no more than a stupid fangirl wanting to get into Sam's pants. I hope she grows a braincell in the next book. Her friends were even more annoying, and her \\"parents\\" were complete idiots, never around. The \\"romantic\\" scenes were anything but romantic. I found them to be very juvenile and cheesy. The only people who would swoon over those randomly thrown in sentences are 13 year olds.     Shiver could have been so much better if it were only told from Sam's perspective, and if he got a girlfriend with some ounce of depth!
B002S0OBMS|5.0|The music and story are incredible, however, I could not tell by previous reviews what the difference was between this cd set and the \\"deluxe.\\"  Definitely pay the extra for the other one. It includes a dvd with footage from the theatrical performance and a book with all the lyrics and scene info.  Well worth the extra investment!!
0061120081|4.0|If you haven't heard of this book before, then chances are you've been living under a rock for the past few decades. This is Harper Lee's classic novel that came out in the early 60s and is now required reading in many school districts.    The story itself is reasonably entertaining fiction while at the same time examining themes such as overt racism, humaneness, fatherly love/protection, and childhood innocence. My main gripes with this book are that it doesn't really examine any of those themes on a any sort of profound level. The themes come up, sure, but Lee fails to deliver any kind of meaningful statement on any of them insofar as I can tell (unless you qualify things like 'racism is bad').    In addition, the language used in the book is clearly dated, which is distracting. Part of this is because of the book's examination of flagrant racism as it was in the 1960s and prior. Much of (though not all) that has significantly abated since then.    Bottom line: Good novel that makes for fairly easy reading. Just don't expect profundity from it.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Wes Anderson's sixth directorial feature and first animated film is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's book Fantastic Mr. Fox. With a script co-written with Noah Baumbach, Anderson's film stays close to the source material (though I can't speak on that completely having never read the source material), but his quirky, minimalist style is still identifiable.    The cast of voice actors, including several Anderson regulars, is top notch. George Clooney is Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep is Mrs. Fox, Jason Schwartzman is their alienated son Ash, Eric Anderson is the impressive nephew Kristofferson, Bill Murray is Mr. Fox's lawyer Badger, and Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Adrien Brody round out the rest of the voice cast. No actor is miscast in their voice roles and Clooney, Dafoe, and Schwartzman give particularly inspired performances.    The film's story is wonderful; both funny, entertaining, and having a strong moral/ethical lesson but its Anderson's direction and various technical aspects that make Fantastic Mr. Fox as fantastic as it is. It's rare for one to mention costume design when referring to an animated film, but the costume design here is wonderful. As many have said before me, it should have received an Oscar nomination and only didn't due to rules about animated features. The characters and sets are intricately designed, showcasing Anderson's attention to detail. It's a painstaking process to make a stop-motion feature and its clear watching the film that the filmmakers wanted to make sure that they were putting their time to great use. While there are plenty of stop-motion movies out there, none look the way this one does which makes it even more fascinating to watch. The animation should fascinate both adults and children with its detail and personality. The soundtrack also contributes to the overall tone of the film with its mix of classic rock and folk music.    More than anything, this film has heart, personality, and charm. It's intelligently written and very quotable, as well as very funny. There is some adult humor, but it's not slyly inserted to amuse parents. It's well-written, clever adult humor that is actually funny and relevant to the film. With that said, it will appeal to both adults and children for different reasons and it doesn't insult the intelligence of either demographic. In a display of very clever writing, Anderson has the characters say \\"cuss\\" in place of any cuss word, which is a rather brilliant touch. Finally, Ash, the teenaged fox desperately vying for his father's attention is actually more human than many live-action characters that hit the screen. Much of this comes from Schwartzman's voice performance, but it's in the writing too. In both personality and expression, I found these stop-motion creations are more expressive and emotional (especially in the eyes) than the majority of motion-capture films that have been released (particularly those by Robert Zemeckis). Even with Anderson's style, I think Roald Dahl would have been very pleased with this film.    This is the best animated film of 2009. Having seen it twice now, I can attest that it's also one of the top ten best films of 2009 and it's sad that many ignore its inventiveness and charm. Wes Anderson and co. have created something very special here.    GRADE: A
0547260695|5.0|Wow, what more can I ask for?  One of my favorite books in pop-up form!  I just love this book - it now occupies prime real estate on my bookshelves!  And it's quite a conversation piece to boot!

Talk about narcissistic!<br />Streep was over-the-top here, even though the best parts of the movie were with Streep and Tucci. I wished they had gone into it at the end just WHY Julia Child didn't like Julie.<br />The writers killed it with the excessive jabs at Republicans. We already know Hollywood hates conservatives but is it really smart to alienate half of your paying audience by insulting them continually? It just comes off as childish and immature, like bullies at a playground.

0756655307|4.0|Art: Interesting! I enjoyed the pictures and various incarnations of my marvel heroes in vivid colors.  Text: Quick tidbits of information from the big stars to the little ones. They also covered several recent events in the Marvel Universe in 2-3 pages mostly gratified in art. Be prepared to find grammatical errors and unfinished sentences (like how that one The Sopranos season finale ended abruptly).    If your a hardcore fan you'd have some doubt this being the bible of the Marvel Universe (always have room for improvement, or else capitalism would not work :-)), if your a casual fan its makes a good coffee table read/or a toilet entertainment/or the last thing you read before bed. Overall Its Alright (3.5 Stars) like the buyer I got it from.

0143038583|3.0|I have read both this and In Defense of of Food.  I just finished the Omnivore's dilemma. The premise of In Defense of food, makes much more sense.  It is about what you should eat, how  much.  He focuses on what you can and should do for your health and the ecology of your local community through your food choices.  It's good advice.  However, Omnivore's Dilemma is wishful thinking, and not at all practical.  Pollan advocates for the entire US agribusiness industry to change.  Yet, he doesn't address  people around the world might starve if the US produces less food.  After describing four meals, he advocates for buying from local producers of vegetables, dairy, poultry, beef, etc.  This is a good idea, but is much expensive that going to Coscto, Trader Joe's, or your local Safeway, etc.  Local Farmer's markets are a great choice, but again much more expensive.  He takes you through his own experience of being a true hunter/gatherer.  Frankly, this last chapter of the book was self-promoting, self-congratulating and quite boring.  In the end, even he acknowledged that this was not at all a practical endeavor, in this day and age. He also maligned that fast food industry, specifically a meal that he shared with his family at MacDonald's.  Granted, we all can limit our fast food intake, for the better. The two meals he clearly prefers, one using Whole Foods and the other being Polyface Farm (a natural farm) on the East Coast.  Again, these are expensive.  On the whole, OD gives an interesting look at farming and ranching practices, both small and much larger operations.  Interesting, but not compelling enough for me to change how I eat.  In Defense of Food, on the other hand does make me think about what I can do for my and my families health, and that of my community.<br /><br />While Pollan is a consummate story teller, in this book his writing style  was much less engaging. Furthermore, his message was that he is right and agribusiness is wrong, there was no middle ground.  He struggles with being an omnivore, but he has an interesting way of discussing it.  For example, he used the word \\"conceit\\" continually.  The overuse of this word was annoying, but I believe that he did so to extricate himself from any of his actions that might appear less than appropriate from his point of view, thereby holding the rest of us to a higher standard for our eating habits.<br /><br />To make my point, last Thanksgiving a I bought a totally free range, organic turkey from a local producer at $4.59/lb.  It was a $75 bird!  At Christmas, I bought the same size turkey,  but from Whole Foods, with some natural connections, but definitely NOT organic, and it cost $2.25/LB.  Still expensive,  this bird was half the price and it tasted exactly the same. So, I may supporting bigger agribusiness with my Christmas turkey, but it wasn't a budget breaker and the quality difference between the two was indiscernible.  I grow my own vegetables, look for sales and will by organic when on priced competitively and it looks. But his premise means to destroy agribusiness without regard for how the ability of the US to feed itself AND the rest of the world.  He condemns without offering real solutions. I cannot abide his ideal.

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis (Blindside, Moneyball, etc) has a nice follow-up book to his investment banking expose \\"Liar's Poker.\\" Essentially, this book is about the financial crisis and tells the story of the crisis through the eyes of people who saw the coming calamity and profited from it. Think George Soros made a lot of money back in the day? Some of these guys tripled Soros' fortune.     If you're looking for actionable advice from this book, you might come away disappointed. One take-away was I learned new ways to be skeptical of the financial markets and investment banks in particular. Other than that, feel free to settle in to a well-told story.     My favorite part of the book was Lewis' description of his lunch with his former Salomon Bros boss Gutfreund - this would be an encounter we all wish we could have!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This review specifically refers to the kino version. The kino version is as true to the original as anyone could ask. Anyone that is critizing it for altering/falling short of the original is asking something impossible or does not understand what this version accomplishes.<br /><br />First of all, the film is not tinted (that reviewer is not even reffering to this version). The restoration makes this 1927 film look very good. It is well known that there is much of the original film that is lost. All of the original film that could be used is used in the edition and where film is missing there is text to fill the viewer in on the missing plot. Also, the original score is indeed in synch with the film, and this is only made possible by these segments where time is elapsed and the plot is summarized with text.<br /><br />I watched the film originally on a disc that came with a fifty dvd 'horror' collection that cost $20. This single movie is more expensive, yet the film is so moving and original, it is well worth the money. Take for example the scene where Freder shouts: 'Molloch.' It has been cited as inspiration for the use of Molloch in Allen Ginsberg's Poem Howl.<br /><br />And this film is not just amazing considering the time it was made. True, there was nothing like it before, but there has been nothing like it since, which is exactly why I place it at the top of my list amongst my very favorite films. And Fritz Lang in general was an absolutely amazing film-maker. I wouldn't compare more than 3 or 4 film-makers in the history of film to him.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|What if? There are not many shows that subtly ask this question and then been able to sustain a tantilizing plot. I have truely grown to look forward to this show. I enjoy the twists and turns in the plot. The writers have wonderful imaginations. And the cast is superb at bringing those words and ideas to life. It is refreshing to be able to look forward to suspending my disbeliefs and delving into this strange little alternate universe. John Noble is brilliant as the questionably insane Walter Bishop. Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson work very well together. And Jasika Nicole cleverly plays the endlessly patient Astrid with a style of her own. These four provide the series with a refreshing camarderie that make you want to tune in next week. Lets hope the following seasons live up to this promising first season.
B000050XEI|4.0|This album is a different step for Enya. Instead of the gentle drone of the synthesizer, you get what sounds like an entire orchestra (but is purely electronic). The lyrics aren't bad either, and R. Ryan still has the touch at this point. As a result, the entire album has a very lush, rich sound with the theme of nature. Not one of her best, but it is a very pretty one. I wish it was longer, though.
B002WZNUJO|5.0|David Sedaris has the most amazing way of describe the human condition--even the most mundane ones. He has the ability of describing his everyday happenings in a way that demands every moment of my attention. The albums is about 9 hours and I cannot believe how quickly the time flies. He truly seems to be in his element in Japan; whether he is trying to learn Japanese, giving up cigarettes, or understanding cultural differences. When You Are Engulfed in Flames reminds me of why I love David Sedaris so much and how painful it is going to be waiting for his next piece of work.

0439023483|5.0|Wow, this book was amazing! I was pulled in from start to finish! I'm going to start on the next right away becuase I can't wait to know what's going to happen to Katniss Everdeen the main character in the story!<br />the ruins of what was once North America,is now the nation of Panem a capital city which is surrounded by, and harshly rules over 12 different districts. It is in district 12 where Katniss lives with her mother and sister. Fenced in their district they are forbidden to step outside of their district into the surrounding woods, and forbidden to make contact with other districts. Here people are starving, so Katniss and her best friend do all that they can to put some food on the table for their families, even breaking the law to do it, which is very dangerous.<br />As if all this is not bad enough there is something more to fear than starving to death. Every year the districts gather in their city squares for what is called the reaping. The reaping is when two names are drawn from each district, one boy and one girl, to fight in an arena til the death. Only one person can be victorious.<br />I feel like I have given away enough of the story already so I will leave it at that. This is an awesome book that you don't want to miss!

If the metropolitan opera can get it right on a live saturday broadcast, then a studio recording should be able to as well.  Also this production seems cold and distant.  A good production should come across like rich dark stained glass.  If you want a good recording tape the met broadcast of this opera.  Now if I can just find my tapes from the eighties.
0790744295|3.0|I remember the day \\"Creepshow\\" opened in 1982. I raced to the theater to see a film directed by George Romero ([[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)]]) and written by Stephen King ([[ASIN:0743437497 The Shining]]). To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Watching it again after many years, I now respect the film for its attempts, a comedic, gross-out horror celebration possessing the adolescent spirit of a live comic book, even if most of the segments are average at best.    Frankly, I still struggle with the comedy, though am aware this is a nostalgic tribute to those fiendishly clever [[ASIN:1888472553 The EC Archives: Tales From The Crypt Volume 1 (v. 1)]] comic books of the 1950s. Camp is never easy to create on the screen, and it requires good acting. Oddly, \\"Creepshow\\" has an impressive cast and even they struggle with the shaky material. The film is separated into six wildly uneven stories, with two being good, the rest average or poor. It opens with a clumsy frame detailing an abusive, beer-swilling father (Tom Atkins) berating his son for reading comic book trash. It's an unimaginative, mostly disturbing segment due to the portrayal of an uncaring mother who could care less her son is apparently slapped on a regular basis. This segue-ways into the stories, starting with \\"Father's Day,\\" a slow-moving exercise noteworthy for being the lone example in film history where (a young) Ed Harris gives a poor performance. But you have to love his awkward attempt at disco dancing.     Stephen King's acting debut follows in \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\\" as a Max Baer hillbilly who makes the mistake of poking a meteor. It's easily the worst vignette, compounded by King's flamboyantly bad portrayal. This segment is so supremely awful, it practically destroys the entire film. \\"Creepshow\\" rebounds with the following two segments \\"Something To Tide You Over\\" and \\"The Crate,\\" eerie exercises aided immeasurably by the fine acting of Ted Danson, Leslie Neilsen, Hal Holbrook and Fritz Weaver. These episodes are clever, if a bit shallow, but Weaver's freak-out after viewing what's inside the dusty crate is memorable.    The film closes on another mediocre note \\"They're Creeping Up On You,\\" with E.G. Marshall as a Howard Hughes-type battling a growing tide of cockroaches. My guess is in post-production Romero and King uncomfortably realized they were stuck with three bad vignettes and two passable ones (leaving out the frame here), thus confronting the great curse of anthology films. If you open with three bad stories, viewers lose interest in a marathon march of mediocrity. So the equation becomes two bad stories, followed by two good, closing with the lessor of the bad (leaving out the frame here). You can't fault the uneven quality of \\"Creepshow\\" too much as even one of the best horror anthologies in history [[ASIN:B000FFJZO2 Trilogy of Terror]], penned by Richard Matheson, sandwiched a weak story in the middle.     What's interesting is that \\"Creepshow\\" is far inferior to its lessor budgeted sequel [[ASIN:B0000509C4 Creepshow 2]], released in 1987. Every vignette in that film was strong, and the closing episode, \\"The Hitchhiker,\\" is easily the best story of both films combined. \\"Creepshow\\" is an average exercise, a disappointment considering the talents involved. The best that can be said is it's superior to [[ASIN:B00005JOJE Twilight Zone - The Movie]]. Perhaps these storied directors with blank checks should have watched 1972's [[ASIN:6305033048 Tales From the Crypt (1972) [VHS]]]?

B002YICN74|4.0|From what I have read, I gather that Nick Jonas desires a career as a serious musician.  This album is apparently a step in that direction.  Does it work?  I think it does.  All songs were written or co-written by Nick.  This is not a bubble-gum, teen-idol album.  The lyrics are simple and direct, as you would expect from one so young.  They are about relationships and self-examination.  But it is the general tone of the music that surprises me.  Nick is acknowledged to be the brains behind the fame and fortune of The Jonas Brothers, an accomplishment he can be proud of.  But this liberating success has not turned him into an over-the-top caricature of a rocker like, for instance, the 80's \\"hair\\" bands.  The songs on this album are not for partying.  They are for listening.<br /><br />The music and lyrics have frequent dark, or at least mature, overtones.  The sound in general is retro, vaguely reminding me sometimes of mid-90's rock (Counting Crows, Wallflowers), and sometimes of soul-influenced rock circa 1970, as in Janis Joplin's solo bands, or 70's funk.  The opening track, \\"Rose Garden\\", is in a minor key, about a girl who is \\"wise beyond her years\\"; it contains early 70's R&B guitar licks.  Another minor key song is the somber ballad \\"In The End\\", in which Nick warns, \\"Baby it all comes back to haunt you in the end\\".  \\"State of Emergency\\" opens with a funky Stevie Wonder hook, and the girl in this song will \\"...charge you by the hour for a straight trip down to Hell.\\"  Another touch of funk is heard in \\"Conspiracy Theory\\", which otherwise is a basic rocker with a good hook.  \\"Tonight\\" is more in a pop vein, but even here the situation is not bright: \\"As the morning sun begins to rise we're fading fast.\\"  The title cut asks, \\"I want someone to need me, is that so bad?\\" And some redemption comes in the final cut, \\"Stronger\\".  In this mid-tempo track with a thumping bass, Nick sings, \\"I wanna know that you'll be with me when everything around is fallin' down...you makin' me stronger than I've ever been now.\\" Probably the most teen-idol sounding number is \\"Last Time Around\\", which has a bit of forced swagger.<br /><br />So Nick, whom I have noticed not to be an extrovert in photos and appearances, seems to be able to unleash his passions in the studio with a group of professional rock musicians.  As far as his youth permits, he lets it all hang out.  His youth shows in his vocals. Not that his voice isn't pleasing or compelling, but hey, he's 17.  Even Dylan was young once, and youth is not an unattractive commodity.  I envy him his position at the threshold of so many possibilities.  Anyway, I find this to be a surprisingly satisfying pop-rock effort.  Furthermore, for those to whom this is important, it is comparatively free of electronic studio effects - it's mainly just Nick and his Administration.' me stronger than I've ever been now.\\" Probably the most teen-idol sounding number is \\"Last Time Around\\", which has a bit of forced swagger.

B001BMXFX0|4.0|This book was very different from what I expected. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, however. There were parts where I laughed. There were parts where I cried.

0061849928|3.0|Thomas Pynchon's novel of postal conspiracies, the dawn of the counter-culture, and the relaxed social norms of 1960's Southern California is considered classic enough to make Time Magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present.  This is opposed to the year 1966, when an unnamed critic from this same magazine, in reference to this same book, lamented, \\"What is the meaning of the gibberish literature that is currently being published as fast as it can be gibbered?\\"  I mention these things for two reasons: Mainly because I found the snarky commentary by Time's unknown reviewer to be funnier than anything I read in 'The Crying of Lot 49', but also because I suspect that the opinion on this book still ranges between classic and gibberish.      Despite its intricate wordplay and oddball narrative - characteristics that certainly have their charms - there are several reasons why I didn't connect with 'Lot 49'.  The primary one is that Mr. Pynchon's writing comes across as very self-satisfied.  I could probably study 'Lot 49' for a long time, and find something new years from now, but I just couldn't muster much interest in the clues he left during my first reading.  I found myself racing to the end of this short book, on past the standard post-modern ambiguous ending, and glad to move on to something else.    Oedipa Maas, housewife, is asked to serve as executrix for the estate of her former lover, the mutli-millionaire Pierce Inverarity.  As she delves deeper into the labyrinth of Pierce's holdings, she discovers (maybe) a strange conspiracy concerning an ages old postal feud, one that, once noticed, seems to stretch into every facet of life.  Aside from some rather dated commentary on the lifestyles of the mid-sixties, the book's main thrust appears to be not so much the mystery that Oedipa uncovers, but the existential effect it has on her.      I feel like much of 'The Crying of Lot 49' is cleverness for cleverness' sake (like the names Oedipa Maas and Pierce Inverarity, for example).  In this way it reminds me of David Foster Wallace's fiction - original, skillful, but ultimately unsatisfying.  (I suppose I should say that Wallace reminds me of Pynchon, since Pynchon came first - but I was already familiar with DFW).  Actually, I've come to realize that I feel this way about most post-modern lit, and certainly about 'Lot 49' - that it lacks substance (my disclaimer here is that I often feel like these books would have held a lot more appeal for me when I was a younger man).  It's as if the author, highly educated and incredible facile as a writer is at a loss for something pertinent to say, and, in order to avoid churning out a morality play, instead turns to self-absorbed tales of highly educated and incredibly facile characters who are at a loss for something pertinent in their lives.  This sort of writing would naturally appeal to highly educated, incredibly facile people - especially those who feel they're still missing something from life.  But while they may identify with the situation, I don't think they'll find any balm for their misery except company.
1594202249|2.0|Confession: this is the first book I've ever read by Pynchon. Unlike most, I was never assigned to read The Crying of Lot 49 in high school, and though it and V are on my long list of to-reads, I just haven't gotten around to it.     I bumped Inherent Vice up the list this past summer, when it made the review rounds as a fun hippie gumshoe novel. Never judge a book by its cover, but man if that isn't a perfect opening image to start a book. 368 lumbering pages later, and I'm wondering why I even bothered finishing it.     This book feels like a really light, really flat mess of subplots with bad humor and nothing driving the story. Our lead character, Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello, is a hippie private dick, and the possibilities seem endless for how such a character could be as memorable as a Marlowe or Spade. Except, Doc is just one of a zillion characters that feels completely flat. It's absolutely impossible to tell where Doc falls on the spectrum of hippiedom - is he a Shaggy, a The Dude, a Maynard G Krebbs? At times his responses suggest he's high as a kite, or has an IQ of about 40. Then, a sentence later, and he might be putting together a massive clue. It's like a dumb Saturday morning cartoon hippie caricature.     Early on, Doc is hired to look into trouble with an old flame's new lover. Sort of. Exactly what he's supposed to do is not really made clear, and Doc really doesn't seem to care. Then someone else hires him, and he doesn't seem to care about that. Throughout the book, in fact, Doc gets thrown into case after case after case, and it's just impossible to tell if Doc has a vested interest in anything.     Here's the thing: it would be FINE if Doc explicitly didn't care; that he was always too stoned to put much effort into it. But Doc wavers all over the ballpark, from sort of caring, then not caring, then caring, then not - and it's all too random to have him come off as anything but a poorly written character.     Ultimately, I don't get why Doc cares tosolve any of the mysteries. He isn't getting paid. He doesn't seem to have a moral or ethical issue. There's sort of a romance reason, but boy is that lost as the book goes on. And without this driving force, the book largely consists of a bunch of events that transpire around Doc; Doc occasionally pokes his head up to see what's going on, but for the most part, he could just as soon take a nap as help his ex-girlfriend out. One might make the mistake of comparing Doc to The Dude of Lebowski fame; this would be an incorrect comparison. The Dude had a goal: get compensation for his peed-on rug, something he cares way more about than Doc does about his ex.     As for the mystery: it's a complete mess, one of those books where a name mentioned in passing 100 pages prior suddenly comes back to the protagonist's mind as important, leaving you to search for just who this person is. There are TONS of unbelievable coincidences in the book that become insanely irritating, and lots and lots of exposition to fill in gaps in logic. It'd be one thing if we were meant to not focus on the mystery and more on Doc floating through it...but we clearly are, based on how little of the book is devoted to anything but.     When all was revealed in the end, it was utterly ho-hum. The sort of thing that feels essentially like a square peg mystery pounded into a round hole narrative that simply didn't want to accept it.    And it's not funny. It's painfully unfunny. There are certainly a few great moments, but those are overshadowed by line after line after line of \\"ba-dum-ching!\\" dialog.     Best thing about this book: the beautiful cover art. Everything goes downhill from there.
0393072231|5.0|As he has with other subjects in the arcane world of finance, Michael Lewis has turned a nightmare of complexity and secrecy into a remarkably readable narrative, populated with eccentric characters and fascinating skulduggery.  Some of Lewis' more subtle points might be lost on less informed readers, concerning the enormous fraud which was the sub-prime mortgage market and its derivative bond and debt default markets.  Other readers may find the language of Bond traders to be gratuitously profane (though this is a relatively minor distraction, given that traders actually think and speak this way).  But despite its difficulties, this is a MUST READ BOOK.<br /><br />\\"The Big Short\\" lays out details of a much deeper profanity created by Wall Street movers and shakers, by their too-close associates in securities rating companies (Moody's and S&P), and by colleagues and co-conspirators working in the Federal Reserve, SEC, and Treasury Department of the US Government.  But the really important point of all this is that Lewis shows us that NOTHING HAS CHANGED since the collapse of the markets in September 2008!<br /><br />Despite losing over a Trillion dollars for their clients, almost all of the people whose public lies and private self-deceptions created the ongoing worldwide financial crisis are still in the same jobs.  Nobody of importance got fired or prosecuted. The same legions of mostly ignorant and highly self-centered Wall Street securities sales people and \\"analysts\\" are still making millions in undeserved commissions by skimming from your savings and mine.  And they are still operating under the same systems of morally bankrupt personal financial incentives that cost many investors half of their retirement funds.<br /><br />The inmates are running the asylum!<br /><br />Among many disturbing and profound points made in this book, I particularly note the following.  [These are my interpretations, not the words of Michael Lewis.]<br /><br />1.  Those of us common people who still have any retirement savings think of our mutual funds as \\"investments\\".  But stock and bond traders and their bosses view stocks and bonds as an enormous betting casino, wherein they hope to manipulate the odds to their personal financial advantage. If the perceived interests of their clients ever seem to conflict with their own, such people are NOT our friends!<br /><br />2.  The two main companies whose business it is to assess and report risks of loss in financial instruments are -- in fundamental reality if not on paper -- \\"owned\\" by Wall Street insiders who stand to profit the most from unrealistic risk ratings and poor oversight.  Analysts who work for these rating companies are almost universally regarded as stupid, gullible, and easily convinced to overlook or simply not to understand even the most glaring or fraudulent misstatements concerning the securities they rate.<br /><br />3. The people who ran -- and who STILL run -- financial system oversight organizations of the US government, were not only badly informed concerning Wall Street players who bet against their investor clients in 2005-2008.  They were literally *disinterested* in clear conflicts of interest, fraudulent misrepresentation of investment risk, and other financial hi-jinks being worked by their former colleagues still on Wall Street.  They were either too stupid or too misinformed to recognize the financial debacle that would inevitably come at the end of the real estate bubble of the 1990s and early 2000s.<br /><br />The one missing element in Lewis' book seems to be some answers to the question \\"what next?\\"  How can the financial incentives of Wall Street brokerage companies be changed to reduce the present enormous pressure toward misrepresentation and fraud among the securities ratings companies?  How can securities sales people be effectively required to place the interests of their investor clients first, above and instead of their own greedy desire to get rich quick? How can the fools (or possibly thieves) who now run US Government financial regulatory agencies be fired (if not prosecuted and jailed), without bringing down the entire world financial system in a further crisis of confidence?<br /><br />Until we start hearing some answers to such questions, a piece of free advice:  if your teenager is talking about doing a college major in Finance or becoming a stock analyst, then DISOWN them!  As Lewis demonstrates in this book, many of the people they would work for are either crooks who should be in prison, or too stupid to tie their own shoe laces!run US Government financial regulatory agencies be fired (if not prosecuted and jailed), without bringing down the entire world financial system in a further crisis of confidence?

B00005RIKI|5.0|5 stars out of 5, no question.<br />One of the best albums from one of the best bands in classic rock, and one of the most overlooked.<br />My one-sentence review goes like this: \\"Free Bird. And several other brilliant tracks.\\"<br /><br />Oh, that track is brilliant (and it's already been said - and said - why), but its massive popularity has overshadowed many of the other tracks on this album.<br /><br />The band transitions effortlessly between the meditative songs and the upbeat rockers, and Pronounced provides a very good mixture of both.<br /><br />\\"I Ain't The One\\" and \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" are both brilliant uptempo numbers, but as is often the case with this band, there's something beneath the swagger: Ronnie & company seem to be trying to avoid trouble. Likewise, Poison Whiskey does not let up, but still delivers its warning about alcohol, at least the bootleg stuff.<br /><br />Tuesday's Gone is a great slow ballad number, but Simple Man seems to score even better in that department, probably because its message feels so on-target.<br /><br />Mississippi Kid is a little weird, but that blues/country style influence was probably quite important to the band.<br /><br />Bonus tracks:<br />Mr. Banker does seem to get a little maudlin, but Down South Jukin' is another great uptempo rock number. And alternate versions of songs this good don't hurt.

B00003CXWV|3.0|This starts off really well, with a guy who kind of stumbles into drug dealing and then applies his great natural talents to it with innovative audacity.  For the first half of the film, it portrays the whole hippy-to-coke era as a a kind of almost innocent frolic.  Then, once some real baddies emerge, it get really rough in the second half, leading to the downfall of a more or less good natured guy who wants to get out and raise his daughter, but cannot.  In other words, this is pretty cheaply romantic, almost making George into a feckless victim of the more ruthless players he is forced to deal with, to ever worsening betrayals.  That is what hollywood did to the story of a criminal who helped bring Escobar's cocaine into the US at horrendous cost to the society.<br /><br />That being said, the film is fun to watch.  You get a feel for the 60s-80s, music, fashion, and all.  For the first hour or so, the acting is also extremely good, particularly with Depp as the young George, and tightly edited.  Once the downward slide begins, however, the film's tone becomes rushed and sloppy.  That makes the second hour boring in addition to dreary and depressing.  OK, it does become a kind of morality tale, but it is rather heavy-handed to say the least.  Finally, it is not an interesting portrayal of the drug industry.<br /><br />I would recommend renting this, as you may not want to watch it over and over.

This book is such a deep and entertaining read. I recommend first reading Batman: Year One by Frank Miller, then this book, and then Dark Victory, as it is a direct sequel.

I gotta go PLAY!) and bloody noses (from riding too fast on a bike, without helmets, to the ocassional game -- when numbers were low, so short kids were allowed -- of sandlot football and/or \\"war\\")...for anyone that remembers summers full of popsicles, candy bars, adventures in the middle of fields, wooded areas (just behind the neighborhoods or even in cardboard \\"forts\\" set up in the vacant lots)...for anyone who still loves the feel of the wind on their face as they run like crazy beside their dog, when going for a \\"walk,\\" this collection, \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,\\" is invaluable.<br /><br />I bought my copy in Kansas City, when it first came out, at one of those giant, retail chain stores (which will go unnamed), so I've had plenty of time to read and reread.  So have others.  And I'd only be repeating the praise (of those who didn't come here to whine, that is) if I go into just a lot of detail about the strips (Watterson's Sunday layouts were/are GLORIOUS illustration/paintings unto themselves).  So I'll just say that Bill Watterson remains the King of Comic Strip creators who _know_ (really know) about the secret joys of childhood -- and the notion of being childlike (not to be confused with childish).  Calvin and Hobbes embody that spirit like no other comic strip characters before or since.  I'm glad that Watterson quit while he and Calvin -- and _Hobbes_! -- were at the top of their games.  And I'm twice as glad that Watterson agreed to this terrific collection which allows us to dip into fond memories of comic strips past, renewing the childlike joy and sense of wonder, which lies (albeit buried a bit too deeply), at the heart of us all.
0767817710|4.0|THE QUICK AND THE DEAD isn't quite the film critic's wet dream and, yep, it is western fluff and rife with cliches, but director Sam Raimi keeps things interesting with his trademark frenetic camera work and screwy pans and inventive points of perspective. Meanwhile, Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe maintain your attention when they're on the screen.<br /><br />In a bit of gender twisting, Sharon Stone plays the straight-shooting lead and, no, we're not used to seeing Sharon Stone other than in sexy provocative roles, and yet this is a diverting change of pace for her, even if her wafer-thin role doesn't give her much to work with. A mysterious female protagonist in a Wild West shoot-'em-up and an evocation of mythic archetypes straight out of the Spaghetti western, I can dig it. This flick is one of my top guilty pleasures in this genre.<br /><br />I liked it better when Sharon Stone's stranger was just known as &#34;the Lady,&#34; so evocative of &#34;the Man with No Name.&#34; And then someone lets slip that her character's name is actually Ellen, and a sliver of that mythical aura is suddenly shaved off. The Lady - or &#34;Ellen&#34; - rides into the dusty town of Redemption, the final destination of her vengeance trail. She arrives in time for the annual quick draw competition, the prize money of which is $123,000. Shifty pistoleros throw their name on the tote board, and each one touts an attitude. The Lady sees this event as her chance to place a killing bullet into John Herod (a bristling Hackman), the prairie town despot.<br /><br />The storyline is hollow and unfolds by the numbers, so instead relish the bigger-than-life characters and the peppering of cool moments. Several actors turn in flashy, memorable performances. A cocky DiCaprio is endearing as the fast-as-lightning Kid (&#34;I'm worth $3,000 in four states&#34;). Gene Hackman predictably chews up scenery as the despicable John Herod, and what he does to Lance Henriksen is sort of a repeat performance of his treatment of Richard Harris in UNFORGIVEN. But my favorite character is probably Russell Crowe's reluctant gunslinging preacher (he's kept chained up when not engaged in gun battles).<br /><br />That Sam Raimi directs with manic energy is like saying that John Wayne walked kinda funny or that Clint Eastwood likes to squint some. Well, of course. And if Raimi falls short of what Sergio Leone brought to the screen, well, hell, I'd like to have seen Leone try to direct the Evil Dead movies with as much quirky panache - although, okay, fine, Leone would probably more than hold his own. But different strokes...<br /><br />As for our heroine, Sharon Stone isn't required to be a great actress here (some would say &#34;As opposed to when? SLIVER?&#34;). She only has to demonstrate an understated flair, that bit of quiet swagger. And she has to look good dealing in lead, smoking that cigarillo, and walking with a purpose in that duster of hers. But Sharon Stone always looks good anyway, whether her choice of weapon is a pistol or an ice pick. And she gets the last word in right before she rides off into the horizon. &#34;Law's come back to town,&#34; she tersely remarks, and then she's gone, having settled her score at last.a repeat performance of his treatment of Richard Harris in UNFORGIVEN.

A man who has been through hell and back, and back again, one of the geniuses behind RHCP and an incredible person. This album, I didn't have the highest hopes for, but it has proved me wrong in so many ways, their is no way to describe the way he builds an entire incredible album on such simplisity. the melodies are so good, with backwards solos thrown in to boot. Every single song is fantastic! Hey, you with the soul! you'll like this album!
1608201236|5.0|The Dark Tide is a wonderful story, but don't read it until you've read at least 2 of the predecessors in the Adrien English series - that's necessary to understand the context of the main characters, and the mysteries in the prior books are astonishingly good (as is the one involved in The Dark Tide).  Once you read one of Josh Lanyon's books or stories you'll be hooked - there's seductive romance but sophisticated crime solving at the same time - it's like a wonderful meal accompanied by a great wine.  There's a real power in Lanyon's work - it draws you in, involves you in a really good mystery and then leaves you feeling comforted and satisfied at the end.  And his stories are enticing because they don't all fall into a single time period - except for the Adrien English series, read at random anything else Josh Lanyon has written and enjoy the ride  - in the different stories you can feel variously as if you're in the postwar 1920's or wartime 1940's, visited with flying aces of World War I, are driving around contemporary southern California or involved in a cold case resolving itself in the backwoods of New Jersey.
B0035V35PI|4.0|This movie could have been so much better if it was 15-30 minutes more. Has Hollywood decided to kill all movies over 1.5 hours? Well we should send ninjas on them after watching this movie cut into merely decent piece of 1.5 hours of entertainment instead of GREAT 2 hours of movie greatness.<br /><br />This movie reminds of the first Terminator.  Instead of a future Cyborgs chasing the protagonists, the ninjas are hunting people down and they seem just as irrepressible. The first Terminator was 108 minutes long and it uses every minute to a great effect. This movie does the same with 90 minutes, but it felt much of the critical scenes were cut.<br /><br />Sure, the plot is worthy of a comic book. But it started to develop real characters the audience could care about when the movie just ends. Hollywood should care more about the quality of the movie little more than the running time.<br /><br />I thought the last fighting sequences were way too video gamey. They were just too bogus and fake even by Hollywood standards.<br /><br />Rain has a real future as an action star. I thought his accent would be too heavy but they were very slight and did not detract from the film. I have seen movies with great Asian actors, such as \\"Memoirs of Geisha\\", that were unfortunately butchered by thick indecipherable accents. This movie isn't one of them.<br /><br />Overall, the action sequences are entertaining and well shot. This movie will leave the audience at the edge of their seats throughout the movie.<br /><br />You will like this movie. Just not as much as you could have.
B001HN694K|3.0|In many ways this is a good movie but is  it  Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice\\"?  Burton has taken some of the characters from Alice and \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" and stuffed them into this screen play which seems to be constructed from scraps of the books but with a  new and darker view.  The original works were very episodic but Burton has added details  and  more  of a plot in an attempt to make sense out of the original.  The result is a movie that is well done but barely resembles Alice.  However, many of the Alice characters are spectacularly drawn.  The Cheshire Cat is particularly well done as are Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but the Dormouse seems to have drunk to much caffeine.  Depp's Mad Hatter is well done but is a new  and different  character whose madness seems to be  in his dress and appearance rather than in any disconnect from reality.  Gone are the talking flowers, the Duchess, and  many other parts of Wonderland along with Alice the young girl.  Instead the movie begins with Alice -- who is now 21 rather than 12 -- at a party.  This sequence is too long too boring and a ridiculous attempt to avoid the governess and a bored Alice falling down a rabbit  hole.  The end  of the movie concludes with another 10 minutes of these ridiculous people which does nothing for the film other than extend  it.  But, as bad as this party is it  is trumped by the totally awful dance done by Depp at the end of the movie.  The Jitterbug scene  was scrapped from Wizard of OZ because it would have spoiled the movie -- the Depp Dance Scene should have been scrapped from this one because it really ruined this movie.<br /><br /> Burton's \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" was very well done and clearly he wanted to meet or  exceed that standard but alas he has fallen short.  Nevertheless this is a  spectacular movie in many ways.  Wonderland is truly a wonder and the various characters very well done.  But Alice In Wonderland it  is not.  It is worth seeing but not worth seeing  again.  It is a 3 star effort at best.a 3 star effort at best.
B000WQWPJQ|4.0|When I popped this Blu-Ray Disc in to watch, I find that it's high definition remastering is really no better than my DVD version.<br /><br />This is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it is certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I ran out to buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 24 in the past year and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I just wasn't that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually bought about 24 Blu-Ray discs, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47\\" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32\\" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47\\" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.

B0002EXH54|5.0|To me \\"Peace Sells\\" is one of the three classic Megadeth albums including: \\"Rust In Peace\\", and \\"Countdown\\". I've always had a fondness for this album but, until recently I never really appreciated \\"Peace Sells\\" until I heard this remixed and remastered version. I do own the other two albums remixed and original \\"Rust In Peace\\" and \\"Countdown\\". I did not like the \\"Countdown\\" remixes, the sampled snare drum killed it, in my opinion the original mixes were fine. I was hesitant to give this remixed album a chance. But after hearing previews of \\"Peace Sells\\" on amazon I was hooked. It's nice to be able to hear some of the subtleties that were lost in the original mix due to inferior technology and older mixing methods.<br /><br />However great it is to hear the extra bits here and there that were previously buried in the original mix, there are a few times that Dave embellished the original tracks too much. For example on \\"The Conjuring\\" the last vocal line last a few beats to long, on \\"Wake Up Dead\\" the guitar solo holds the last note too long.  During \\"Peace Sells\\" I could hear some heavy gating on the guitar tracks. At the same time, these are very trivial discrepancies and I must say that the drums and the bass have a much fuller, present, and punchier sound, while the guitars got an upgrade as well with a much more dynamic sound. All in all each instrument owns a specific stake in the frequency spectrum producing a much tighter, brighter, and bigger sound.<br /><br />The tracks that stick out to me as sounding better are \\"Peace Sells\\", \\"Good Morning/Black Friday\\", \\"Bad Omen\\", \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\", and \\"My Last Words\\".<br /><br />I think it's cool that Dave went back not to just remaster the original albums, like many lazy artists and cheap labels often do to generate new profit, but also tediously remixed them too. Though I may disagree with a small percentage of his decisions at the mixing console overall I am very impressed and pleased with how much better He made this album sound. I know some of you may disagree and that's fine but for me it's nice to re-experience this classic album mixed through today's superior studio technology.made this album sound.

6302470021|2.0|What can one say about this complete & utter mess of a movie. I was waiting for a good laugh, very few and far between. Yes I too noticed lots similar to the Austin movies, aleast they had a story line and a lot of laughs. I guess this movie made in the sixties explains why it is what it is. Too much of something they were on back then. After reading some reviews on Casino Royale I really expected more of a laugh than what I got. sorry, this one is not for me.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|It is a shame that this book has received best seller status - it means that the author will likely continue in the same vein.The premise is actually intriguing and is what brought me to it in the first place. I should have read all of the previous reviews and saved my money, but I had just purchased my first Kindle and was anxious to fill up the \\"Home\\" screen with titles. Big \\"OOPS\\"!<br /><br />I do not agree with those reviewers who say the book does not read like a fourteen year old wrote it - it is EXACTLY like a fourteen year old wrote it - tiresome caracters, simplistic dialog, trite ending. I tried so hard to care about what happened to these people, to love someone, even to like someone and there just wasn't enough of anything to hold onto. If Ms Sebold had developed even one character beyond the middle school book-report level I could recommed this book to some readers, but it is as though she comes to the brink and then counts the words and decides she doesn't want to go over the minimum required.

B001QTXM5Y|3.0|I was not a fan of this director, I found the 300 boring and dumb, but this is definitely a cut above that.<br /><br />Excellent special affects, camera work and characterizations make this a watchable comic book opera with dollops of graphic sexual content between evenly spaced jolts of extreme violence.  This movie is really RRR, twenty years ago It would have been X, in any case not for younger teenagers.<br /><br />The morally ambiguous ending which seems to be the mode now a days I find tedious.  The alternative reality with Richard Nixon as the perpetual president and the super heroes getting involved in politics is a nice springboard for the film but the smirking directors/screen writers left wing sympathies become a little annoying at times.<br /><br />The plot does plod badly in parts.  It really needed a crisper pace but for a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn you could do worse.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I'm a big gamer, so I am used to rapidly shaking and fast moving sequences; but somehow cloverfield still managed to get this very seasoned fps gamer massive headaches. I have attempted multiple times over the span of a month attempting to try to enjoy this movie without getting sick but I just can'd do it. The stupid 'shaking' camera is almost taken to excess. There was one scene where the monster is right in front of him destroying the city with the army bringing in tanks and soldiers to try to gun it down, and instead of focusing on the action, he decided to constantly pan back and forth between looking at the monster and looking at his annoyingly scared friends. Not only did this intensify my headache, it also made me rage to no end! I just want to see the friggin action, not your stupid scared friends doing nothing!!!    I really really wanted to watch this movie and enjoy it because it did seem like a entertaining movie. I enjoyed what little of the movie I was able to watch, but the stupid camera work totally kills it.
B00154GEFU|1.0|This Album didn't do it for me.  Usually a great prog album will grow on you and get better the more times you listen to it.  This album did the opposite I like it at first and found it borring with age (except he instrumental that ran into the song NO WAY BACK, that was good).  Before I bought this album or knew about Asia Featuring John Payne, I had a pre-idea of how it would sound.  I thought it would come in like thunder like Neil Pert on Rush's Vapor Trails and have a good solid first song radio single.  As long as these guys had to work on their return \\"they could have done better\\".      I am a little excited about Omega but part of me doesn't even want to give it a chance.    Although I love the musicians that Make up the Original Asia band (A TRUE SUPERGROUP)  I find myself shocked that I would concider turning away from musicans that make up my favorite bands.    Original Asia (OA) or Asia Featuring John Payne (AFJP)  IF YOU HAVE TO PICK, WHO WOULD YOU PICK AND WHY     This is very interesting to me as I have have heard both singers in the band live at different times.  John Payne plays music spanding the entire carrer of the band while he older musicians don't really want to acknolwege the last (what? 6 albums where John Payne was the vocalist). If I remember correctly Howe, Downs, and Palmer were on the Aqua album with John Payne (Giving REAL Credibility To John Payne's HISTORY with the band). YES has had a revolving door and like the new singer or not, the band still loves to play the music (new and old).     I'm going to side with John Payne's new line up.   The Reason is that, I love the John Payne attitude. \\"Another Chapter for the Band.\\"     Original Asia,   YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE A WHITE OUT PEN AND REMOVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE BANDS HISTORY.

0061922315|5.0|When Somer and Krishnan meet and marry while after medical school in San Francisco, their future looks bright.  They are in love, and they are both destined for successful medical careers.  When they make the decision to start a family, everything seems to be falling into place for the couple.   When the miscarriages begin, the relationship between the young couple becomes strained; and when Somer's physician confirms that she is actually premenopausal, it becomes very clear that their plans of having a child of their own would never become a reality.  When Krishnan suggests adopting a child from his native India, Somer is a first resistant....but eventually the two make plans to do exactly that, and adopt a little girl from an Indian orphanage.    An amazing story and peek into a country that many know little about.  The author's tales moves between two worlds and two Indias; the reader sees the lives of the Indian villagers whose very livelihood depends on their ability to harvest their crops, feed their families, and the choices that come about as a result of that.  There is the affluent India of servants and jewels and extravagant weddings......and then there is the United States, to where Krishnan has emigrated, Somer is from, and the two adopt and take their baby girl.   It is a story that confronts the very definition of family; it is not to be missed.      DYB
0141439475|5.0|Today the story of Frankenstein and his \\"monster\\" is thought of as a horror story, bringing to mind the performance of Boris Karloff and bolts in the neck. But the original Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's literary creation, is in fact more science fiction than horror, asking us the question of what is man in a world where science can work miracles, even with life itself? Or are there things mankind should best leave alone? The \\"monster\\" in this novel is therefore not the frightening thing, but rather a victim of the strange experiment, an involuntary resurrection, the tragic result of man tinkering with the provenance of God.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this question is one which is still with us today, in our world of medical miracles, and the fact that we still wrestle with questions about when to let death take its natural course shows that Shelley and her story were more than just idle speculation, but a deep examination of the question of what it is to be human. For death remains frightening today just as it was to our ancestors, and you cannot read Frankenstein without wondering if, given the same opportunity to defeat mortality, you might make the same decision these characters do.

1439190275|5.0|[[ASIN:1439190275 New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.]]    Do you have the \\"Edge\\"? I do. And thank god for that. I've lost 52 pounds using the Atkins Nutritional Approach. However, \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\" really helped me understand the metabolic process behind the \\"Atkins Edge\\" and how the \\"Metabolic Bully\\" keeps me from having that edge. When I lower my carbohydrate consumption, my body begins burning up stored and dietary fat for fuel. If my carbohydrates are above what would be an individual number for everyone, the metabolic bully is there to keep my fat safely stored in the fat cells. High carbohydrate consumption keeps the metabolic bully strong and energy will come primarily from glucose/carbohydrates, leaving my body fat right where it is.    That's a very simplistic description of the metabolic changes that occur when  you use the  Atkins Diet. It is fleshed out in depth in \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\". Once you have the Atkins Edge, you won't ever want to go back to a high carbohydrate diet. The`vitality you feel, the mental clarity and the increasing slenderness of your body will convince you that this is the way to eat for life. It's an incredible feeling that you have to live to understand.    Get the Edge! You'll be so glad you did.

On side 1, I knew what I was getting with Sky Moves Sideways 1( I had already heard it on \\"Stars Die-The Delerium Years 91-97\\").\\"Dislocated Day\\" moves up the speed of the first side and moves into a very strong, but subtle \\"The Moon Touches You Shoulder\\".\\"Prepare Yourself\\" is a great lead-in to \\"The Sky Moves Sideways 2\\", another great song. Disc 2 starts with the complete version of \\"Sky Moves Sideways\\" -alternate version (34 plus minutes), which if you love extended songs is a joy to the ears. \\"Stars Die\\" is a great song to listen to. Next we have the two version of \\"Moonloop\\", both of them are fine songs, although I prefer the longer 16 minute one myself.

If you want to know technical stuff about it go to wikipedia.    Interesting points: The \\"title track\\" \\"Houses of the Holy\\" was bumped over to their next album Physical Graffiti (no \\"fillers\\" on this album, it just didn't fit) The \\"Fantasy\\" sequences from their \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" film feature it's title namesake plus the Rain Song & No Quarter.  No Quarter was Plant's  Tolkienesque styled offering, harkening back to Ramble On & The Battle of Evermore.    My personal favorite track is Over the Hills & Far Away. The combination of acoustic, metal, synth, love song, & philosophy, where else do find that?

B0039UTDFG|1.0|A great documentary, but I absolutely cannot believe they had Oprah narrate this.  The BBC version with David Attenborough is worth 5 stars.  This Oprah dubbed version is worth 1 star.  If you enjoyed Planet Earth, you should enjoy this.
0345495004|4.0|I thought this was an interesting story and very well written. It would make an excellent choice for a woman`s book club to discuss.
0553278398|3.0|For Foundation series followers, this is like the dessert at the end of a sumptuous meal. For those beginning the series, I would still recommend that it be read at the end of the series. A little self-indulgent, slow-paced at times. The usefulness of this novel is more appreciated after or as you read the subsequent Foundation novels. To that extent, it may be a good idea to read this first book first, and then start on to the next ones. On the other hand, you will not miss the plot or feel it is incomplete.<br /><br />The novel starts off with Hari Seldon giving a talk on psychohistory at a mathematics convention at Trantor, the capital of the Empire, thereby inviting the attention of the Emperor, Cleon I, who thinks Seldon would be best manipulated into extending the life of the decaying empire and its rule over 25 million worlds. Chetter Hummin thinks differently, and wants to have Hari Seldon develop psychohistory so that the period of chaos that would follow the demise of the empire can be shortened. Cleon's right-hand man, Demerzel, on the other hand, wants to give Seldon a long leash, allow him to complete his work, and then reel him in. A twist in the tale at the end, the revelation of a robot, and the novel sets things up nicely for the second book in the series, Foundation.
1592402038|3.0|A love letter to punctuation. This book dissects and instructs punctuation in our lovely English language, explaining not only the proper uses but also a justification for punctuation. Truss illustrates the logical uses and needs for punctuation that rings so true for us sticklers/lovers of grammar. Her prose is often times annoyingly hyperbolic, pedantic, and trivial, but many of her explanations, clarifications, and justifications are useful and right-on. Her focus, rightly, is always on logic and the powers of our dynamic written language. Though British, it is applicable to American English. You know whom I would love to see a book about grammar from? Bill Bryson. Heck, yeah. Grade: B
B000VE439Y|5.0|This disc is excellent, as are the special features.  My only regret is that neither this edition nor any other edition of the Life of Brian have yet included outtakes from the Biggus Dickus scene.  I'd love to see outtakes/gag reels from any scene, but that one especially.  I'm sure they must be hilarious, as Michael Palin can barely contain his laughter in the final cut!  So here's hoping that Monty Python will someday WELEASE...a GAG WEEL!
0199535523|5.0|Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for? Grade: A
0307463745|4.0|A page turner! I read it in one sitting (2.5 hours).    A nice sequel to 'Getting Real'.
0316017922|5.0|This book's seeks to find the 'factors' that makes people successful. Not only does it analyzes most of its cases through their different variables, but it gives plenty of examples to prove his hypothesis. Well-written, bold and hard to put down!
0380788624|5.0|The tacit, though eventually explained, thesis of the book is that cunning and wit won the WWII, with seminal spin-offs like digital computers, instead of mighty brawn. So, instead of focusing on the figureheads of brawn in WWII, who usually get the most attention (e.g., Hitler, Churchill), these people are only comically peripheral to this book's main focus on a battle of cryptographers and conspiracies to dominate the world's currency/banking. Though it may sound cliche, this gives the reader an entirely refreshing perspective on the events and significance of WWII, in a way that will make seemingly dry topics such as cryptoanalysis seem like wizardry (there is also a quasi-wizard in the book!). Therein lies Stephenson's talent.

1416594787|5.0|Creationists are History Deniers. Like the willfull denial of the Holocaust, dispite all the evidence, so too must History Deniers willfully ignore the evidence in fossils, our genes, morphologies, and biogeography, to assert their ideologically-driven hatred of evolution.     But, I don't want to talk about the \\"debate\\" of evolution. The \\"debate\\" merely provides a compelling framework to explore many facinating facts and stories of natural history and science. Indeed, evolution and the very history of life is the greatest show on Earth: thats why I read it. I certainly didn't need Dawkins to debunk Creationist ideologies; rather, I treasured Dawkins amazing talent to weave together the very story of evolution and science into a compelling read.     My favourite Dawkins book is the Ancestor's Tale, and it has much in common with this book too. In AT, Dawkins weaved together an amazing collection of stories of life and evolution, each one worthy of as the cover-story in a National Geographic, into a backwards-journey through human speciation to the very origins of life. The Greatest Show on Earth tackles complimentary stories of equal delight (from bacterial evolution experiments, birds-as-dinosaurs, to radioactive clocks in the Earth), and sets it up to show that evolution is the only sensible explanation to the multitudes of evidence in fossils, genes, morphologies, and biogeography. (Mixed in are some funny acounts of History Denialism: if Norah did save all the animals who lived to repopulate the Earth, wouldn't Mount Ararat be the epicentre of biodiversity, with concentric circles of increasied speciation away from the mythological landing-point of the Ark? Hahaha!)     I don't know if Dawkins actively does science anymore, but he has an uncanny insight into the field. This book is not like some cozy popular science books, but is well-written and has detailed accounts of some of the most important studies on life, accessible to everyone, but deep enough to captive scientists too.
0446677450|4.0|I noticed most people taking offense to the way Robert Kiyosaki describes the term \\"losers.\\"  Obviously, the people who take offense to this did not understand what that term means in this particular context.  The reasons why savers would be \\"losers\\" are the following:    1.Inflation.  Even though you continue to save money in an account, the actual value of the money fluctuates because of inflation.  You may have $10,000 physical dollars saved but the actual value of that $10,000 may be more like $8,000.    2.  The dollar collapses.  I'm not here to argue whether the dollar is going to collapse.  However, if that scenario was to play out, guess what happens to the money you have saved?  Again, we are only talking about value.  Sure, your money is insured but if the money has little or no value, what's the point?    Robert Kiyosaki is not looking down on people because they save money in a bank account.  He says several times that that is a step in the right direction.  When he uses the term \\"losers,\\" he's referring to the value of the dollar, not the individual.    My only complaint about the book is that it tends to be repetitive.  It is possible, however, for some people, that repetition is necessary or a better way to absorb material.    Bottom line:  Robert Kiyosaki has written a book to make you think.  If you need concrete, step by advice, this may not be the book for you.
B00008BXJG|5.0|My opinion on AC/DC is that, in the Bon Scott days, they gradually became more and more consistent with each new release.  Despite that,  I still believe Powerage is their best overall album.  This one comes close, though.    The title song has been played a thousand times on a thousand different classic rock stations around the country, and probably around the world. Not a favorite song of mine to be honest (perhaps due to overexposure, or perhaps I just don't think it's that great) and probably the weakest big hit they ever wrote, but who cares?  Because starting with the next song, this album just turns incredible.    \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" has always been one of my favorite songs.  An immediately enjoyable guitar riff, STRONG vocal melody, and one of the most spectacular songs in the bands career.  Clearly AC/DC was not influenced by the disco movement.  I bet they even laughed at the thought of writing a disco song and wrote off the whole movement.    \\"Walk All Over You\\" has one of the most passionate verse melodies in Bon Scott's short career.  Seriously, listen to how much emotion he puts into this song when he's singing it.  He nailed a perfect performance.   Moments of his singing almost make me cry, but something tells me getting soft and tearing up is definitely *not* what the band was going for, haha.   Oh well, I love it all the time.    \\"Touch Too Much\\" is incredibly melodic.  This sounds like the kind of song that should have been a major hit all across the world with a verse melody and chorus that's *amazingly* memorable.  Why wasn't it?  I have no idea.  Should have been bigger than the title song even.    \\"Beating Around the Bush\\" features an extremely raw rock and roll style to the way the verse melody is delivered, and I love it.  Great guitar solo too.      By the way, while it's one my mind- what's most amazing about this album is that, in my opinion at least, the guitar riffs themselves aren't the greatest.  I can't think of a single guitar riff that really jumps out to me the same way, to name one example, the one in \\"Down Payment Blues\\" does.  Powerage and High Voltage smear this album in terms of guitar riffs alone, but despite that, the songwriting feels significantly stronger this time around, and Bon Scott's vocals are really on the money as well.      This album *does* show a turning point in the bands career however.  They were obviously going in a more commercial direction regardless what would have happened with Bon Scott.  That doesn't take anything away from the music however (at least not on this album).      \\"Night Crawler\\" never used to be one of my favorites, but now that I'm older, wiser and smarter, I can appreciate those slow, creepy vocals, along with the underrated guitar solos.      Overall, yes.  This is one of the best hard rock albums of 1979.  A must own.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a huge fan of both movies and music. I am such a fan that I'm not sure if I enjoy more! With that in mind, you can probably only imagine how many soundtracks I've bought over the years. Many soundtracks seem to have one or two great songs and the rest of the music on the CD just seem to fizzle out in comparison.<br /><br />This is NOT the case with the Twilight Soundtrack!<br /><br />The Twilight Soundtrack is _by far_ the BEST soundtrack I have come to listen to and own!<br /><br />If you enjoy the books and/or Twilight Saga movies, you will enjoy this soundtrack even MORE than the average bear.
B00000JCY0|5.0|Sweet Fanny Adams marks the period when Sweet were determined to prove to everyone (and perhaps even themselves) they could actually write fairly sophisticated pop songs and rock out with the best of them.  Did the band succeed?  How about a huge YES!      What makes Sweet Fanny Adams a bit different compared to later albums is the way this album feels.  It's heavier than later Sweet albums by just a tad, and as a result, the songwriting is probably not *quite* as good as the tunes you'd hear from future Sweet albums.    Either way, none of that matters a bit.  Why?  Because the music featured here is all about having FUN and rocking out and partying and cheering and screaming... AND I can just keep going and going, haha.    \\"Heartbreak Today\\" is a mighty fine pop song with a great, memorable chorus.  I love this song a lot.  \\"No You Don't\\" has a chorus that feels like it probably influenced the 80's hair metal band Ratt, and probably Twisted Sister as well.  In the context of this album however, and with the glam-rock movement in full swing during the mid 70's when the song was created, it's quite appropriate and listenable.    \\"Sweet F.A.\\" absolutely COOKS with adrenaline.  Mighty fast and powerful guitar riff, memorable chorus... perhaps the only thing that slightly hurts the song is that brief synth thing that appears right after the chorus.  It sounds dated and reminds me of the Brady Bunch, but who cares- it only lasts a few seconds, and doesn't distract from the song *that* much.    \\"Restless\\" and \\"Into the Night\\" are more highly enjoyable pop songs, and to be honest, these two songs do more to signal just how amazing Sweet would be in the near future, but for what they are, these two songs are quite listenable all the same.  Maybe just not quite at the level of songwriting brilliance that would appear on later Sweet albums.    Overall, Sweet wanted to prove they were the real deal, and guess what?  They definitely proved it, hard and heavy.  Pick up Sweet Fanny Adams.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Excellent product, great condition, amazing movie, fast shipping, best price    You have to buy this; you will not be disappointed.
B000056VJ7|4.0|So finally, after all these years, I get to hear the greatest album ever (or one of them, supposedly) in Bat Out of Hell.    I was already *very* familiar with three of the songs going into the album, but it's good to know the rest features mostly high points (with one big low, but just *one*).    The title song is a thrilling display of vocal talent.  Meat Loaf sings with such determination, passion, and originality (hey, *I* certainly have never heard a guy sing with a voice like that) and the title song is simply the most astonishing example of vocal range I've heard in quite some time.      In addition to vocal range, he also has a warm and comfortable vibe that immediately springs from his voice box, which explains why some people feel so passionately about his music.      It does not explain however, how in the WORLD the people responsible for preventing Meat Loaf from making this album back in the late 70's SOMEHOW couldn't hear a distinct singing voice when it was clearly right in front of their faces.  That's a huge mystery in itself, especially for the 70's when the music industry was supposed to be about signing and recording original musicians.  Maybe it was just an example of Meat Loaf performing in front of -and trying to impress- all the wrong people.  Oh well, the album got made, and that's all that really matters now, isn't it?    \\"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\\" is a VERY good song.  A song that immediately reminds me of somewhere extremely cold, and definitely lonely and depressed- Meat Loaf's vocals here take this song to new, previously unexplored heights.  Simply an amazing song.    The one song I think absolutely stinks however, is \\"Heaven Can Wait\\".  This sounds like some kind of cheap, predictable songwriting attempt to copy what Peter Gabriel did with Genesis, or maybe even an attempt to copy what Kansas did when they made the occasional cheesy ballads from time to time.   Whatever it is, this sounds like a really bad song to me.\\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" was never a big favorite of mine either but at least Meat Loaf's voice is brilliant on this one (even if the melody itself is nothing to write home about).    \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\".  What MORE can possibly be said about this epic progressive rock track?  Hey, if you don't think it's prog, by all means, disagree, but it sure was written in a way that *feels* prog-ish.    Anyway, it's a great song, but I'm not always in the mood to hear it.  The baseball segment of the song is the obvious weakpoint, and even my dad doesn't particular care for that part of the song despite being a minor Meat Loaf fan himself.    \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" ends the album with some really emotional vocals.  A great way to end an album- showcasing Meat Loaf's distinct vocal style one more time... for over eight minutes.  Overlong?   Nah, not particularly.    No, it's not the greatest album of the 70's, but it's original at least, thanks to Meat Loaf's voice which honestly sounds like *nothing* else out there and therefore makes this a pretty good album overall.
0061245097|5.0|I love this series! Frost is a great writer and this second novel doesn't disapoint. I was dissatisfied with the ending of the first novel. However, this book picks up the romance a couple chapters in. The relationship between Cat and Bones really excels in this book. Also, we learn a lot more about the vampire world! Frost is an excellent writer and I'm looking forward to reading more! This is a definite must if you enjoyed the first novel :)
B002VECMAE|4.0|It's been cited by various people that this among this movie's weaknesses is the fact that it falls in between a drama, a comedy, a satire, and who knows what else. I agree with those people, this movie has aspects of all those things. I, unlike many others, do not believe this to be a weakness at all. The strange fusion of all the different genres combined in this movies creates a brand of humor and storytelling akin to a that of Terry Pratchet. Unlike many comedies, which recycle the same gag and situational comedy over and over, this movie has fresh plot driven versatile humor, which continues to entertain, rather than getting old once you realize that you are seeing the same joke over and over again in different contexts, as happens with many comedies. The satire is not particularly biting, but it's not mean spirited as much military satire is, so again, I for one, approve of the decisions they made in that area. If this film has a weakness, it is character development, which relies a great deal on the narrator to progress. This movie is entertaining, I came away from the experience feeling I was glad I'd seen it, rather that wishing I could get two hours of my life back. I certainly recommend this movie.
0743289692|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ.WE ALL SHOULD READ IT TO UNDERSTAND HOW SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFER AND DIE  BECAUSE OF PREJUDISM,IGNORANCE AND RELIGION.HOW IN THE NAME OF GOD PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE A LICENCE TO KILL,PUNISH,TORTURE ,IN THIS BOOK WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE THE VICTIMS,ALSO AN INSPIRATION ,AS THE AUTHOR HAS MORE INTEGRITY THAN MOST PEOPLE ,IS BRAVE AND A REAL SURVIVOR.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000000WHH|5.0|Without question one of the top 5 recording sessions of the 80's in Rock/Pop - if not THE BEST.  Boy George & his band at the height of their powers bang the cosmic gong loud & clear on every number. I still can't get these tunes out of my head a quarter century later.  Colour this one GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003AYDPYQ|5.0|This show catches you and doesn't let you go.  The actors, the story, the drama...it's all great.
B002YOKVU4|4.0|I was very happy with the movie quality. But some of the sound quality could be revised.in some scenes the audio quality gets louder than lifter in the same scene. Overall it is still great to own on blu Ray.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Jake Johnson, Washington Coastal Salish. I am a writer of fiction, poetry, and screenplay. I must say Eric Kripke is the man for putting this show out there for us to watch and be a part of. Supernatural is the best thing to happen to television since Rod Serling widened our mental state of being with The Twilight Zone. The Winchester family is the most intruguing in the history of fictisious hero families. The team of writers, directors, producers on down to the actors must have a love and dedecation to the show, it seems that way. I have seasons 1-4 on DVD and not one episode is a disapointment. This show rocks. As a writer who is picky with what he is entertained by, Supernatural is a sure winner, and should stand the test of time along side X Files, Star Trek, Twin Peaks and all the other shows from the depths of darkness. I advise, ney dare anyone to enter the world of Sam and dean Winchester. Check out this product, Eric Kripke is a sure talent, a name that will be remembered.

B001PHTPDU|5.0|why you can never get ahead?  Why it seems no matter what you do with your money, it always turns sour?    Read this book and you'll see why the game is designed to take your money, not grow it.    1) \\"Privatization\\" of public money, jobs, schools, jails, war...  money from millions handed over to a few.  If you profit from war and throwing people in jail, where is the incentive to end any despair or injustice?    2) \\"Deregulation\\" of huge corporations who invent schemes to steal your money. Since I've read this book, I've seen Sec. of State Hillary Clinton admonish Argentina for not adhering to \\"free market\\" ideology, watched her ask countries to accept the coup d'etat in Honduras, and seen Euro banks and the IMF lurking over Greece, Haiti and Chile, just waiting to \\"shock\\" them into unemployment and poverty.  It's always a double \\"shock\\" whammy that makes whole countries defenseless to loan sharks who then force conditions that allow multinationals to loot them even further.    3) \\"Union busting\\", or class warfare that Milton Friedman, Ronald Reagan, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, have waged on billions of people, so a few thousand can get rich beyond YOUR dreams.    Ronald Reagan once said \\"government is not the solution to our problem, it is the problem\\".  I guess it is, if you put a biblical conservative in office.    This is an important book that everyone with a brain should read.

This is pretty much what I'd hoped for in their (unfortunately but well deserved) last album.  It has a sound a lot like they're last but it really kicks it up a notch.  The writing is better and the songs really jam.  It's sad too see the end of an incredible legend of the Rock world but these guys deserve to do anything they want.  They've done so much for us!  Thanks Guys!  You Still Rock!

0743581601|5.0|In this review, I planned to focus mainly on aspects of the unabridged AUDIO version, since plenty of other reviews describing this book are already here.<br /><br />The unabridged AUDIOBOOK version is one of the best narrations I've listened to.  Beyond the basics of speaking clearly, the narrators have expressive voices without being overly dramatic, and know just when to add a pause or hesitation in the reading.  Their voices conveyed so much of the characters' internal emotional states -- widely ranging amongst worry, anger, wonder, fear, surprise, dawning contemplation, to name just a few.<br /><br />In a way, this is a story within a story.  An introverted, bookish young woman is asked to listen to the story of an elderly woman with a mysterious past, in order to write her biography.  This is the story of the bookish young woman, and nested within that, it is the dramatic story of the elderly woman, who gradually reveals layers of her mystery.<br /><br />During adulthood, both of the main characters are stoic and introverted, with strong emotional control, who value their privacy, and tend towards quiet contemplation, carefully considering all angles before making a decision.  The personality of the young biographer is the extreme opposite of the flamboyant, impulsive, outgoing diva personality that actresses enjoy playing.  I think it takes an excellent narrator to speak for such introverted characters; it seems a subtle art.<br /><br />I highly recommend this audiobook version to those who are not in a hurry.  The writing style, and the speaking styles, are to be savored, slowly.  It is not a quick read.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Its was a awsome movie. I bought parti-1 \\"Ice Age\\". Now part-2 \\" Dawn Of The Dinosaurs\\". Can't wait to see part-3 hihihi....
B002S0OBMS|2.0|Yes, I have been a \\"phan\\" of the original show since the early 90's.  Like many others my age, this show is what made me decide to pursue a career in musical theatre.  To see what Lord ALW has done with this \\"sequel\\" is incredibly upsetting.<br /><br />The plot for LND is so poorly thought out and ignores pretty much everything that was accomplished in the original production.  The characters in LND bear little to no resemblance to the characters we are all familiar with in the first show.  The biggest problem is, none of these character are LIKABLE.  If this were a stand alone show (as ALW keeps insisting it is) with NO reference to the original show and different character names, I still wouldn't like it because of how unlikable the characters are.  With the exception of Christine and Gustave - who simply walk through the show and let things happen to them - the characters in this show are selfish, self serving, and destructive.<br /><br />I give it two stars because I DO enjoy some of the music.  I have been in love with the title song's melody since I first heard it as The Heart is Slow to Learn at ALW's 50th birthday concert.  The new lyrics in the show are very dull and not nearly as effective.  Luckily, the music is the same, and I can FINALLY get sheet music for The Heart is Slow to Learn.  Til I Hear You Sing is also enjoyable - more because of Ramin's voice than anything else.  Again, the lyrics are pretty banal.  Beneath a Moonless Sky also has pretty music, but, AWFUL, AWFUL lyric which completely destroys the original story for me.  Frankly, I feel the wrong lyricist was hired for this project.  Over all, the music doesn't fit and flow stylistically.  Several pieces are jarringly out of place - The Beauty Underneath, which sounds like it was left over from Jesus Christ Superstar. Bathing Beauty, which belongs in Guys and Dolls as a Hot Box number rather than a story about the Phantom of the Opera - and someone did point out the similarity in melody to the Bunny Hop.  As with most ALW shows, you can hear music from his other productions - as well as productions which are not his (Guys and Dolls, Chicago).  Most predominantly, I hear Sunset Blvd.  Others have mentioned hearing a LOT of Woman in White - Woman in White never interested me, so I don't have reference for that.<br /><br />I feel for the performers on this disc.  They are all incredibly talented, and doing the best they can with the material given them.<br /><br />I don't want to give \\"spoilers\\" here, but, I did write a song by song blog at [...] if anyone is interested.<br /><br />Bottom line - while some of the music is good, overall, this is bad phan phic at best - which took FOUR people to write.As with most ALW shows, you can hear music from his other productions - as well as productions which are not his (Guys and Dolls, Chicago).

B00005JNJV|5.0|I did not care much for any of the previous Batman films.  The first movie, which was directed by Tim Burton, was okay I guess.  I had some major problems with it, but it wasn't horrible.  I just didn't think it was very good.  (A position I have held since I first saw that movie, not just since I saw the Dark Knight.  Although I don't see what difference it makes if Dark Knight had made me like Batman '89 less).  I got some serious heat when I reviewed that movie.  There's nothing else I can say about my position on that movie that I haven't stated many times already.  You either agree with me or you don't.  I can't do any more to change your mind.  Batman Returns was, in my opinion, the closest that the Warner Bros. Batman series came to making a great Batman movie.  Again, many people disagree with me, but that's my position.  Batman Forever was not good, but I don't hate it.  It was meant to be a lighter Batman movie that younger kids could enjoy, after the parental backlash that Batman Returns got.  Batman and Robin was admittedly a fiasco, but I actually enjoy watching that movie.  It's what could be called an unintentional comedy, a movie that sucks so badly that it is actually funny.  Nevertheless, that movie killed the Batman movie franchise, and it was not resurrected again until eight years later.  Batman Begins was at the time the best Batman movie by far, and is still one of the best superhero comic book movies I have ever seen in my life.  It doesn't just fix all the problems of the previous movie series.  It erased those movies from my mind and showed me what Batman really looks like on the big screen.    Man, where to begin.  Let's start with the plot.  This movie abandons the continuity of the previous series, and starts a whole new story line from scratch.  This was definitely a wise choice.  In this movie, we actually get to see the origin of Batman, who he is, his training, and we actually explore why he became Batman, something Batman '89 neverreally answered.  At all.  It was probably a wise choice not to put Batman's origin and the Joker in the same movie, mainly because the Joker is more interesting than Batman.  I didn't like Jack Nicholson's interpretation as the Joker, but he still overshadowed Keaton's performance of Batman.  No matter how you play the Joker, he is always going to steal the show away from Batman in any film.  That's what happened in the Tim Burton movie, and that's what happened in The Dark Knight.  Except it was okay in this instance, because this movie is centered on Batman.  In Dark Knight, the Joker takes center stage, but we already have been introduced to Batman in the previous movie.  The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison, a man who has pretty much lost his way.  He is approached by Henri Ducard, who wants him to join the League of shadows.  Through a series of flashbacks, Bruce's childhood is revealed, and how his parents were murdered in a random mugging.  It was nice that they put in Joe Chill, the man who killed the Waynes in the comics.  I didn't really care for the '89 version which had the Joker killing Batman's parents in order to set up the complicated relationship that Batman and the Joker have.  In this version, just like in the comics, Bruce feels animosity towards crime in general, not just against one person.  The fact that Bruce is never able to take his revenge on Chill really generalizes Batman's mission.  In the '89 version, when Batman finds out that it was the Joker who killed his parents, then after he killed the Joker, why would he continue to be Batman?  He would feel a sense of finality in avenging his parents' murder.  In this movie, he lost his parents without ever really being able to avenge their murders.  The only way he can truly avenge their murders is by destroying the thing that killed them: the corruption in his city.  He wants to clean up all of Gotham, and in so doing come to terms with the loss of his parents.    Bruce enters training as part of the League of Shadows, but when he realizes that he will be expected to kill criminals, he turns on Ra's al Ghul, the mysterious leader of the League of Shadows.  Fighting for his life, Bruce unintentionally causes Ghul's death.  Ducard, who had supervised Bruce's training, almost falls to his death, but Bruce saves his life.  Bruce returns to Gotham to implement his training.  He becomes Batman, and no one suspects him even though Batman appears right after he comes back after being gone for seven years.  I do love this movie, but that is a small plot hole.  Batman apprehends Carmine Falcone, one of the city's biggest mob bosses.  Bruce then discovers that Falcone was working for the League of Shadows, and plans to introduce the Scarecrow's fear toxin into the air to cause the city to destroy itself through mass panic and hysteria.  Bruce also discovers that a recovered Ducard is in fact the actual Ra's al Ghul, and the other one was just a decoy.  Batman stops Ra's by destroying the train that Ra's was using to disperse the gas.  I didn't like this scene when I first saw it as a fifteen-year-old kid.  Batman actually killed someone.  And I'm going to go off on a tangent here to talk about Batman killing people.  Batman does not kill people.  Yes, I realize he did in the old, old comics.  But that was in the early days of Batman, before he really became who he is today.  In today's Batman comic continuity, Batman does not kill.  It is because his parents were murdered in front of him.  This is one of the defining attributes of Batman.  He hates killing.  If you say that it is okay to make a movie about Batman which depicts him killing people, then I make this argument.  In the original Superman comics, it is not revealed where Superman is from.  Jor-El and Lara are not his parents, and nothing can hurt him, not even Kryptonite.  You can't use Batman's ancient history as a way of explaining away huge errors that some movies have made about him.  So as I was saying, I didn't like this scene as a kid.  But then I realized something.  Batman didn't put Ra's on the train.  He didn't force Ra's to drive toward the Wayne tower.  He just left the car when the train was about to crash.  Anyway, after this Batman and Gordon agree to finish cleaning up the city.    Let me get into the casting.  They originally wanted David Boreazaz to play Batman, but he declined the role.  Which is a shame.  After seeing him on Angel, I think he was born for the role.  Regardless, Christian Bale is by far my favorite Batman.  I know some people prefer Keaton, and I kind of understand why.  The thing is, Bale is much better rounded than Keaton.  Because Keaton plays a horrible Bruce Wayne.  Christian Bale is the first guy who could successfully play both Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Some people complain about his voice, how it's so loud and raspy.  My argument is, it scares the crud out of the bad guys, and that's kind of his main purpose in being Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals.  Bale also is great at beating up the bad guys.  Some people complain that the action is to quick and jerky, and you can't see much of it.  But the thing is, Batman is supposed to be one of the most advanced martial artists in the world.  Very advanced martial arts like that is pretty hard to see, even in real life.  Of all the Batman movies, I thought this one did the best as far as choreographing the action scenes.    Just about all of the other cast members were perfect in their roles.  After Batman and Robin, I'm surprised they got so many big names in the movie.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant as always, in his performance of Lucious Fox, Bruce Wayne's business manager.  Michael Caine was perfect for the role of Alfred, Bruce's butler/father figure.  Liam Neeson was great as Ra's al Ghul, and he is my second favorite live action Batman villian, behind Heath Ledger's Joker.  Cillian Murphy was great as the Scarecrow.  People complain thathe didn't have enough screen time, and he was underdeveloped.  I thought they spent as much screen time as was necessary.  They hit on his obsession with the mind and it's power over the body, and his obsession with fear.  I don't really know what else they could have done with him.  I really don't think the Scarecrow is interesting enough to be the primary antagonist in a Batman movie.  In my opinion, Gary Oldman is the best actor in this movie.  He completely disappeared into his role.  He became Jim Gordon.  He even made himself look like the drawing of Gordon in Year One.  It wasn't even Gary Oldman anymore, it was actually Jim Gordon.  If there was one performance that was a little weak, it was Katie Holmes' performance as Rachel Dawes.  She was way too self-righteous, and she got on my nerves.  She was supposed to be the voice of reason, I guess, but to me she just came across as an egomaniac with an annoying holier-than-thou attitude.  She wasn't horrible, but she is definitely the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.    Overall, this is not just a great superhero movie, it is a great movie period.  I think this is far better than the four previous Batman movies combined.  Not only did it get Batman right, but it got all the other characters down, and there were a lot of them.  This was possibly the best comic book movie of all time for a while, until it was topped by the Dark Knight three years later.

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|On a diffrent website I've gave it a 3, but it was meant to be a 3.5/5. As I listen to the tracks multiple times after a few weeks of having it, I've grown to love it but still can't stand sweepstakes, I deleted that after I downloaded the album on my computer (I did bought the cd). Also the ending is still not as great as their last one they put out, and that's why I've gave it a 3.5. Since they won't let you give half stars I'll give it a 4 since I've taking off sweepstakes and accepted the last song for what it is, it's nearly perfect, for that it a 4/5. Now a list of my favorite tracks;<br />Rhinestone Eyes<br />Stylo<br />Superfast Jellyfish<br />Empire Ants<br />On Melancholy Hill (grown to love)<br />Broken (also grown to love)<br />Plastic Beach<br />To Binge (grown to love)<br />Cloud of Unknowing<br /><br />Enjoy.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is a fantastic box set, but unfortunately very expensive.  The first box set I bought was from a 3rd party seller and ended up getting a counterfeit version, unfortunately.  The authentic version is a must have for the avid Beatles fan.  Up until the White Album, The Beatles only cared about the mono mixes of their songs and the stereo mix was an afterthought.  Some songs are significantly different in mono, and even in different keys or feature different effects.  It is interesting that stereo and mono mixes are that much different.<br /><br />When the CD versions of the albums came out at the beginning of the CD era, the early technology was so poor that people were recording MP3s from records and they were better than the CD version.  That goes to show how poor the first pressed Beatles CDs were.  I know I have always hated listening to Sgt. Pepper in particular, because it sounded so flat on CD.  Now with the mono remaster, it sounds much more lively and actually packs a punch.  Heeya!<br /><br />The differences, admittedly, are probably going to be picked up by the audiophile a lot more than the casual listener.  With that said, it is great to get mini replicas of each mono album (does not include \\"Let it Be\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\") with record sleeves and plastic wrap for the CD as well as each individual album.  Be wary of counterfeit box sets, and if you are buying this used, be sure you know how to differentiate it from the real thing.  Also, be sure you can return it if you do get the counterfeit.

B001TH8UUA|3.0|All those 3 stars are saying \\"I am neutral on the product.\\" I have not used this product because the HDMI TV that I ordered along and planned to use this product was not shipped to me.  I had to cancel my order for the TV because the vendor did not even contact me to advise whether they ship outside the US or not. I have had dozens of orders and more in my wish list that I will be glad if Amazon and its vendors ship overseas like car parts, computer peripherals, home appliances, etc.  Living outside the US is a hardship by itself although we have APO, FPO, DPO addresses and personal pouch facilities.  Amazon.com could be an excellent venue if there are no restrictions in shipping to APO, FPO, and DPO addresses.  I don't blame Amazon.com or the vendors if they suspect some greedy Americans have import/export businesses that are totally dependent on APO, FPO and DPO addresses.  However, to think that everybody abuse the system is equally wrong. And worst yet is the vendor not communicating with the person placing the order.  I am airing my frustrations when I load my Amazon.com shopping cart then I have to remove everything because of shipping restrictions. This has happened so many times.  To Amazon.com and all vendors, IF WE ALL AMERICANS HAVE TO RETURN TO THE STATES TO ENJOY DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU, THEN THINK OF NO TROOPS AND DIPLOMATS OVERSEAS.  THAT IS JUST AS BAD AS ISOLATING YOUR OWN COUNTRY.  HOW CAN BUSINESSES SHOW THEIR PATRIOTISM? ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

1423119509|3.0|A great series for children and young adults (teenagers).  However, although I would recommend these books as a good series to read, the author definitely leaves you wanting something more.  Each consecutive book appears to shorten in length, which surprised me with the abundance of mythological lore and the creative liberty the author could have used given it was a fictional book and the audience it was geared towards.  In doing a comparison of the book for the price paid, this is probably the greatest reason this review received only 3 stars instead of 4.  I would definitely recommend buying these books used.  The price for the books new leaves you feeling a little bit jilted.
B0038BZ9JU|5.0|Tilbury Town railroad station, Tilbury, Essex, England - a common event unfolds on the train platform. A young woman is arguing with her boyfriend. But what seems like a natural occurrence to the naked eye is a turning point in nineteen-year-old Katie Jarvis's life, as an Oscar®-winning director, Andrea Arnold, was watching the argument unfold from across the train platform. And thus begins the story of Fish Tank, a gritty and gripping 2009 drama, set in England, directed by Andrea Arnold. Katie Jarvis, the volatile and angry girlfriend on the platform, stars as Mia Williams, a fifteen-year-old binge drinking high-school dropout, living in a small tenement with her single mother Joanne, played by the British Independent Film Award nominee Kierston Waering, and her younger sister Tyler, played by Rebecca Griffiths. Mia is an expelled student, a volatile adolescent, and a passionate street dancer. After a day of picking fights with fellow street-dancing females, illegally purchasing alcohol from street dealers, avoiding a conference with a secondary school representative and trying to rescue a white horse from a seemingly abandoned lot, the teenager returns home to find that her mother has brought home a young man, Connor, played by Hunger's Michael Fassbender. Connor is a seemingly nice man, who takes Mia, Joanne and Tyler on a family drive to go fishing at a secluded pond. But Connor is sheltered beneath a shell that hides the man's true colors, as his eyes are not focused on Mia's drinking, smoking, abusive mother - they are focused on Mia.    The style in which Fish Tank is filmed resembles that of Christian Mungiu's 4 luni, 3 sãptãmâni ºi 2 zile (known in English by 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days), in that what is being filmed is almost a documentary. The camera shakes when Mia is attacked by three tough boys when trying to rescue the white horse. The camera shakes when Mia chases after Connor's car after he walks out on her mother, and as Mia flees from the clutches of the three thugs in the lot. A handheld camera is used for scenes when Mia is in the abandoned apartment, practicing her hip-hop dancing to Ja Rule and Nas. The brilliant and engaging \\"new\\" camera style enables the audience to engage more sufficiently in Mia's life as she lives it.    Rarely do I ever close my eyes in films, and rarely do I have to reach over and hold the hand of whomever is sitting next to me in the theatre, whether it be my mother, father, sister, or that woman sitting next to me who keeps chatting with her girlfriend, but Fish Tank and Katie Jarvis's exhilarating, awe-inspiring, heartbreaking performance made me do both. Her role pins you to your seat from the very first scene to the very last moments, which has been seen once before this year in a young newcomer's performance in a motion picture - Gabourey \\"Gabby\\" Sidibe in Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire. In fact, Fish Tank has been referred to as Britain's Precious, two motion pictures with hauntingly similar yet eerily different plotlines - a high-school dropout, living in a bad area, with an abusive parent and troubled lives. Like Sidibe, the debutante Katie Jarvis outshines and upstages veteran actors such as Michael Fassbender and Kierston Waering, and offers an authentic and breathtaking role in an unfortunately relatable part.    Fish Tank: Directed by Andrea Arnold. Starring Katie Jarvis, Michael Fassbender, Kierston Waering, Rebecca Griffiths and Harry Treadaway.
0385341008|5.0|A beautiful and emotionally engaging story that will appeal to women of all ages, but has much more depth than most of the fiction marketed to this demographic.  In 1946 Britain, where recovery from World War II has barely begun, a young writer receives a letter from a man in Guernsey who has come into possession of a book that once belonged to her.  Intrigued by his reference to an oddly-named reading group on the island (he Literary Society of the title), she wants to write about it for the Times Literary Supplement.  This leads her into a correspondence with an expanding group of island residents, and an understanding of the little-known story of  German occupation of Guernsey and the other Channel Islands.  Many of the characters fit the familiar image of the dotty English lady, but others are more complex, and one of the most important appears only in the stories told by people who knew her.  The characters are variously courageous, compassionate, obstinate, and wonderfully ordinary, but all are developed with gentle good humor.  If you aren't smiling when you finish this book, you deserve a stint of kitchen duty peeling potatoes.

And give it to them I did, I sent or lent this book to several men I know and I am waiting for a good bulk deal where I can send it to everyone else for Christmas.    P.S. I read a lot of these relationship books and this is the one. The other I would suggest to any couple is the \\"respecting your husband\\" chapters in the Love and Respect book by Eggerrichs.

The biggest letdown is that they advertise it to be a hilarious comedy, when it is just a story about a guy that has mental problems.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|So, I finally got all of Britney's older albums (...Baby One More Time - In The Zone) and once I listened to this CD, other than \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Me Against The Music\\" (which I had heard before), I couldn't understand why this was everybody's #1 favorite Britney CD. I think it will probably grow on me eventually, but right now... I'm in the middle.<br /><br />In \\"Me Against The Music\\", Britney does a duet with her #1 hero, Madonna. But let me tell you, the Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix is a little weird.<br /><br />\\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" is okay, but the Yin Yang Twins' rapping kind of makes it a little annoying.<br /><br />\\"Showdown\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", and \\"Early Mornin'\\" are some of my favorites from the album. If you have Britney's album, Circus, \\"Early Mornin'\\" sounds kind of like a combination of \\"Blur\\" and \\"Mannequin\\".<br /><br />\\"Outrageous\\" is a great song if you don't mind overly se*y songs.<br /><br />I don't really have much of an opinion on the other songs yet, but like I said, I'm sure it will grow on me.<br /><br />You should buy this album if you like Britney or great club/se* songs.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|The answer: yes, he does.<br /><br />I thought I would get this question out of the way, as that is what my friends wanted to know upon learning I had seen \\"The Ghost Writer.\\" By now I suspect McGregor has a clause in every contract that stipulates million dollar fines from the producers unless the actor is allowed to flash us on film. Cheeky sod!<br /><br />Back on topic:<br /><br />Former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is staying on Nantucket, writing his memoirs. When a body is fished out of the sea near Lang's house, it turns out to be that of his ghost writer. The death is quickly pronounced a suicide and a new ghost writer is dispatched. Enter Ewan McGregor (still fully clothed at this point). The man quickly realizes not all is well in the house of Lang. Dead body, witness in a coma, group of seemingly innocent photographs carefully hidden under the dead man's sock drawer... Lots of questions, few answers. Alas, once The Ghost Writer makes the decision to step foot on the path of discovery, he cannot turn back. The unfolding events promise a sinister conclusion, and do not disappoint...<br /><br />The tense story is courtesy of a book by the British journalist Robert Harris. The book caused a bit of a stir upon its publication back in the UK as the character of Adam Lang is clearly made in the image of the actual former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The insinuations the author makes about the ex-Prime Minister and his possible involvement with the CIA are so preposterous they cannot be believed. According to Harris, the low probability of the events was the very reason he avoided being sued by Blair. And yet, the suggestions are so deliciously scandalous, some part of us cannot help but wish they were true... Harris and Polanski, the film's director, expertly transformed the book into a script. The slow boil of tension the film delivers reminds me somewhat of \\"Touch of Evil\\" by Orson Welles. No CGI, no gimmicks; just good old fashioned filmmaking supporting a clever plot... It has been a while since going to the movies felt so good. Do not deprive yourself of the experience.has been a while since going to the movies felt so good.

B000003TA4|5.0|Easily the greatest album of the 90's. Went global overnight and knocked off the Michael Jackson, Def Leppard, M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, Poison, Ratt etc. Mercury may have died that year but this was a newborn gift from the music Gods that was a breath of fresh air at a stagnant time.

Listening to \\"PAFUERA TELARANAS\\" is an excellent ride of the mind and the soul.  And you don't have to be a woman in order to enjoy it, or you need to be is sensitive enough, and a lover of beauty and creativity.

The authors' choice to tell the story through a series of letters is perfect. The charm of letter writing allows each character's personality and intermost feelings to come out in a way that makes them real to the reader. Some of the stories shared by various members of the Potato Peel Society were so touching. In the end, the story conveyed the importance of trusting yourself and following your own heart in the more important matters of life.
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|I just can't get into this one.  And I really hate to say that, because I've loved BSB from the very beginning!  Yeah, it's okay...but just okay.  The only standouts are the lead single, \\"Straight Through My Heart\\" and the last few tracks, \\"Shattered, \\"She's a Dream\\", and \\"Undone\\".  I like their more mature sound on the last two albums (Unbreakable, Never Gone) a lot better than this one.  Overall, the problem with this new release is that I simply don't remember it after a few listens.  It's not stuck in my head constantly like other albums I have.  And the majority of the tracks are just a bit too juvenile given the group's ages now.  I've got the few songs I like ripped onto my iPod, but the CD itself is just collecting dust on my shelf.  Maybe next time around?

This is a fun action packed adventure<br /><br />Now to the bad part... The Blu Ray isnt worth it because this came out before Blu Ray was made so its not necessary. Of course there is a slight quality difference from the DVD version but its not a major issue.

But we are such idiots as to basically starve ourselves to death or so stupid as to not realize that you don't go even 800 yards off a highway and \\"Into The Wild\\" and try and prove it without a plan for either survival or recovery....Quite frankly after reading this sentimental version of what is a very sad but pathetic existence and waste of a young life I am sorry that I didn't die of starvation in reading the book...it certainly didn't feed my mind or soul with anything other than pity for both Chris and the Author.  Forget the book.  Rent the DVD and then get distracted, so you can say you watched it and won't feel guilty about perpetuating the idiocy of this type of drama.
B000AP04NI|4.0|GUESS WHAT?  The BLU-RAY is out, and the Todd-AO version is now far, far superior to the DVD.  The following comments are based on the old DVD and the Todd-AO version in the theater:  Fox shouldn't blame the fledging Todd-AO itself, even though retrofitted onto existing cameras, for any of their problems with the Todd-AO transfer.  I saw the original 70 mm Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! in the '50s, in San Francisco.  I was a dedicated amateur photographer, working in both 35 mm and larger formats, and my photography friends and I marveled at the detail that got on the screen in Todd-AO.  &#34;Everyone&#34; was talking about it!  One day I was getting my hair cut and the stranger in the next chair started telling the barber how great Todd-AO was.  It turned out he was a photographer too.  There was only one brief series of shots that was not clear -- during the &#34;Many a new day&#34; song, the young women toward the extreme right and left sides of the screen were not sharp in certain shots.  Words like &#34;sharp&#34; and &#34;clear&#34; may not be the most descriptive.  At that time Kodak divided sharpness into two correlated properties &#34;acutance&#34; and &#34;resolution.&#34;  &#34;Resolution&#34; had the same definition as it does today, and, in use,  was practically a synonym for detail or definition.  &#34;Acutance&#34; was the capacity of a medium to make sharp edges -- like a knife edge -- look sharp .., and it was associated with a number of other factors, like contrast, and appropriateness of the brightness.  The first two Todd-AO films, Oklahoma! (1955) and Around the World in 80 Days (1956) films had very high resolution, but very slightly softer acutance than some of the later 70 mm films (some of these later films had what reviewers commonly called &#34;an etched look&#34;).  They both had very natural appearing color, more natural than usual in the movies, and more natural than we were used to seeing with the color print and slide films we were used to using.  Oklahoma! & 80 Days could both remain clear and detailed even when we moved down very close to the screen (row 9).  Even people sitting farther back were treated to a very large image, because there was no stage, organ, or orchestra pit between the viewers and the screen ... the seats went right down almost to the chord of the curved screen's arc (at least in San Francisco).  We measured the apparent size of the image with a calibrated detachable viewfinder, and found that the Todd-AO image (AR of 2.2:1) from the 20th row at the Coronet was about the same size in the viewfinder as was a 35 mm widescreen image (2.35, approximately) in the 5th row at the Grand Lake in Oakland, a movie palace with organ, stage, and pit taking up space.  It should be noted that after a dispute between formats as childish as the VHS/Betamax or Blu-ray HD-DVD wars, the size of the image at the Coronet was reduced, when they took out the deeply curving Todd-AO screen, and put in a very shallowly curved screen that would be compatible with competing 70 mm formats.  We simply moved closer after that change.  They left the deeply curved curtains in place .. did they think nobody would notice?  One last note: The 6 channel magnetic sound was magnificent, and had really high dynamic range.  The trombones and tuba between stanzas of the &#34;The Farmer and the Cowman&#34; song seemed to nearly rip the roof off.  It was responsible for making me an audiophile.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|A Perfect Getaway: 7 out of 10: For a slow moving thriller that cheats... a little, A Perfect Getaway isn't that bad. It has gorgeous cinematography and while it moves slowly, it successfully builds up tension with character development rather than relying on black cats jumping out of closets or severed body parts every ten minutes.     The tale is about three couples in Hawaii and one couple could be a pair of murders from the big island.     Our protagonist couple (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) is a bit nerdy and a bit goofy. Jovovich in particular gives a wonderfully awkward performance in body language and facial expressions.     Trying to get into the Hawaii spirit our protagonist honeymooners attempt to do a favor for a second couple hitchhiking (Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth), but Hemsworth gives off such a bad vibe that the Zahn and Jovoich are naturally concerned about running into him on the trail again.     They take refuge with the \\"cool\\" couple (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez). Olyphant in particular simply cascades charisma onto the screen even when attempting to convince others he has a plate in his head from his Special Forces days. But even the cool couple could just as easily be the killers (after all Olyphant seems to like fondling his special forces knife a bit two much and this is a movie.)    All this interaction is among well placed news reports that a non-nondescript couple is wanted for questioning for a murder and are suspected in being on the same trail as our plucky honeymooners.      Director Twohy isn't back in Pitch Black form but he shows a surer directing hand than he did in Chronicles of Riddick and he gets better performances out of his actors than he did in Below. In fact for a movie with basically six people and very little action the film rests almost exclusively on the actor's shoulders. The actors certainly hold up their end of the bargain across the board.    The movie does cheat a bit as I stated before but this isa thriller rather than a mystery (after all there are only three couples in the whole film) and the journey is more fun than the reveal. In fact the movie has such a relaxed pace and vibe you can easily forget it is a thriller at all. That's when it gets you.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is an emotionally draining book and I mean that in the best way possible. I found myself crying by the end of the very first chapter. I continued to cry on and off throughout the entire book. Being someone who doesn't cry often, these tears signaled something monumental. From word one, The Hunger Games draws you in and holds you captive. It provides beautifully written (and uniquely named) characters for you to love and then brutalizes them until you think you can't take it anymore. After it hurts you, you beg for more.<br /><br />I was afraid to read The Hunger Games. I was afraid of the hype. I hadn't heard one bad word about this book. It seems everyone in the world has read it and it's universally loved. It was a recipe for disaster. It couldn't possibly be as good as everyone said. Yet, somehow The Hunger Games managed to actually exceed every expectation I had. I completely get the obsessive love, the rabid forming of Team Peeta vs. Team Gale, the desperation to acquire the final book.<br /><br />I could continue this gushing love-fest for thousands of more words, but I have to rush off to get a copy of Catching Fire. I must learn what is causing the rampant teach choosing. In a nutshell, the concept put forth in The Hunger Games sucks you in, but it's the pure emotion that makes this book unforgettable.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. When I saw it for the first time, from the opening scene, I knew 12 Monkeys was not going to be anything like I thought it would be. The movie darted back & forth from past to present to future in a dizzying manner; then about midway through the movie I had an \\"AH HAH!\\" moment when it all made sense! What an imagination. And it was the first time Brad Pitt was almost unrecognizable...by his own choice. The Special Edition version goes into deep detail how Terry Gilliam & crew created 12 Monkeys on a small budget.

1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot's \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is an enthralling look at the origin of HeLa cells that grew \\"with [such] mythological intensity,\\" that they \\"seemed unstoppable.\\"  They were a \\"continuously dividing line of cells all descended from one original sample\\" acquired from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who suffered from a particularly virulent form of cervical cancer complicated by syphilis.  During the Jim Crow era, many hospitals refused to treat black patients.  Therefore, Lacks traveled twenty miles to Johns Hopkins, where black people were segregated in \\"colored wards.\\"  After enduring heavy doses of radiation that charred her skin, Henrietta, who was thirty-one and the mother of five, died in agony.  Neither she nor her family had any idea that the cells obtained from her cervix in 1951 would eventually number in the trillions and become a vital part of medical research all over the world.<br /><br />Henrietta, who was one of ten children, was born in Virginia in 1920.  She grew up in a \\"home-house,\\" a four-room log cabin that formerly served as slave quarters.  She later married her cousin, David (known as Day).  Neither Henrietta nor Day had much education.  They spent their childhood planting and harvesting tobacco, milking cows, and feeding farm animals.  One of their children, Elsie, had an undiagnosed mental condition that left her unable to speak.  She was eventually sent to an overcrowded, poorly staffed, and unsanitary institution named Crownsville, where patients lived under horrific conditions and were subject to dangerous experiments.  Henrietta and Day had few resources to cope with life's tragedies and were at the mercy of an exploitative society.<br /><br />The author expertly depicts Henrietta, her extended family and acquaintances, as well as various scientists and physicians who either knew Henrietta or worked with her cells after her death.  In addition, Skloot traces the incredible odyssey of HeLa cells that \\"went up in the first space missions\\" and contributed to \\"the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, [and] in vitro fertilization.\\" HeLa cells also were instrumental in the development of drugs to treat such conditions as hemophilia and Parkinson's.  Rebecca decided to track down the family and find out how they felt about what had happened to Henrietta.  At first, the Lackses wanted no part of her. They were bitter and angry over the racism and condescension that they had endured over the years and had no reason to trust anyone outside of their immediate circle.  In addition, they suffered from a variety of serious ailments such as diabetes and prostate cancer, but had spotty health insurance coverage and little money to pay doctor bills.  They received no profit from their mother's unwitting donation to medical science.<br /><br />\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" touches on the history, sociology, science, and ethics of an era when the chasm between black and white, rich and poor, educated and unschooled, was very deep.  Henrietta's descendants express themselves eloquently. They are confused and incensed over what was taken from their mother without her knowledge or permission.  Nor does Skloot skimp on the science; she explains how and why certain cells are more valuable than others.  In addition, she discusses the legal and moral issues raised when someone takes tissue from a patient and then gives or sells it to researchers.  Rebecca admits that \\"the Lackses challenged everything I thought I knew about faith, science, journalism, and race.\\"issions\\" and contributed to \\"the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, [and] in vitro fertilization.\\" HeLa cells also were instrumental in the development of drugs to treat such conditions as hemophilia and Parkinson's.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm very out of shape. I need to lose 20lbs to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight & be happy.  I've never done aerobics or any classes at the gym. I've also never used a video workout before I got this DVD...   While doing level 1 I had to keep stopping because I was tired! I say to myself that I'll never get off level 1! I do feel myself getting stronger everyday & I'm able to keep up better & better.   This workout is perfect for a mom like me because it's only 30 minutes (27 minutes including stretching) and it kicks your ass! You do need a yoga mat & hand weights (weights I got at Walmart $3 each I think). If I remember I'll update this review after 30 days with total inches & pounds lost.  I would buy it all over again if I had to. I would recommend this DVD to a friend too.

B002Q0F6V0|4.0|As someone that went and saw Alice in Chains during the Clash of Titans tour in Fayetteville in '91, after watching their progression during the late 80's grunge scene, it was an incredible experience. They are no doubt my favorite band of all time. I don't think I am alone in saying that when I heard Jerry and company were putting out another album under the AiC moniker I hovered between ecstatic desperation and mind-numbing trepidation. The album could be a new beginning or an absolute disaster and for me at least, without Layne at the helm, I was putting money on the latter.    I am very happy to say my fears were unwarranted. Does the album reach the heights of their previous work? Absolutely not. But it lays the groundwork for what I expect to be some great music in the future. I see a lot of knee-jerk reviews on Amazon about how great the album is or how it is little more than poser music. The truth is somewhere in between, and in my opinion some of the songs here could easily have landed on previous albums without a hiccup.    There is no doubt that 'this' Alice in Chains was shooting for something a little less black then previous works, the fact that it still succeeds in being the AiC that I know and love without Layne is something just shy of a miracle.  I have no problems shuffling these songs in with my other AiC tracks and that's really more than I ever hoped for.    3.5 out of 5 stars

0385504225|3.0|I just finished this tome, hoping for some glimmer of greatness like I felt in his blockbuster creation. Alas, it wasn't to be.<br /><br />If The Da Vinci Code was his only book, Dan Brown's place in the firmament of popular authors marrying controversial material to tight-paced action would be assured. But, despite meticulous in-depth research on the masonic order and various symbols and vivid description of Washington D.C. and its historic monuments, it left me disappointed. I couldn't help but wonder if he simply get corralled into producing another blockbuster under deadline, and scrambled to assemble a less gripping payoff in plot with the usual Disney-esque good guys and black-hearted villains. Was he simply lured into coming out with another inspired effort, or, short of that, a semblance thereof -- huge sales guaranteed -- once on the merry-go-round of celebrity? Alas, that's how the mish-mash of a book struck me, anyhow, and I loved DVC so much I've read it four times.<br /><br />It's unfortunate our materialistic culture encourages writers to keep cranking out new creations whether they feel inspired to or not, replicating the old structural formula of past efforts and in the process lose the kind of cohesion, pacing and inspired, integrated thought of former, more original glories.<br /><br />Granted, equaling such an effort with the follow up was virtually impossible. But I wondered about my inability to get into the book with more than a fraction of my enthrallment over DVC. I've changed since then; Brown has changed; the level of humanity's collective consciousness has changed. Why did I find myself objecting to the black-and-white blending of profound enlightened thought with evil, violent characters? It worked before; why not now? I'm not sure, but found it so off-putting, such an oil-and-water mix effort, that, frankly, I resented the two being under the same cover. The extremes seemed to cancel each other out, like a good formula gone awry. the material covered is so fascinating, it might have worked better as a creative non-fiction work.<br /><br />Is it possible we've turned a corner in our consciousness, so that trying to blend pure, expansive knowledge with dark, contracting evil just doesn't work anymore?erial covered is so fascinating, it might have worked better as a creative non-fiction work.<br /><br />Is it possible we've turned a corner in our consciousness, so that trying to blend pure, expansive knowledge with dark, contracting evil just doesn't work anymore?

B002VECMAE|3.0|While I was excited about seeing this film when I first saw the trailer, the actual viewing was  a letdown. It had a long list of well-known and popular actors in it, it wasn't too lengthy,and  it's ending was unambiguous. I was not impressed, however. The story lacked depth and emotional  attachment. I found myself not caring what happened next. I watch a LOT of movies and this is the  very first review I've written on amazon.com. Lately I've had the honor of watching some fine films  (notably District 9, Departures, The Hurt Locker, and others); all of which overshadowed this one  completely. It was mildly entertaining, but in my opinion, not worth purchasing. I rented it at a  red box for very little $.
B003B13QQU|5.0|Goldfrapp is one of those groups that you simply cannot pin down to any one genre or style of music.  Each of the groups's albums is unique, and range from the exotically esoteric, to super-charged, ultra cool dance, to bubble gum synth-pop, to hippie-era style folk music.  The group's newest album, Head First, is no different, and seems a throw-back to the late 70's, and early 80's music in its sound.  Simply put, this is not Seventh Tree, or Felt Mountain, nor is it the lushly cool Supernature either.  Head First is all early 80's sounding synth-pop music, very danceable, and to some, may sound very dated.      Personally, I love the album in its entirety.  I've come to expect nothing less from Goldfrapp then the unexpected, and totally different from album to album.  It's what I love most about Goldfrapp's music - you never know what to expect, and it always takes you on a different journey each time, in very profound, very beautiful, and very unpredictable ways.    Honestly, most fans are probably either going to hate Goldfrapp's newest album, or they're going to absolutely love it.  There's not much to this album to be merely \\"luke warm' about.  And if you think that this is \\"the direction\\" that Goldfrapp is going in, and are disappointed in that \\"direction\\", then you aren't a true Goldfrapp fan in my opinion, because if you were, you would know that Goldfrapp hasn't really settled for any \\"one direction\\" where their music is concerned - on ANY of their albums thus far.  They just continue to be Goldfrapp, which is what I love about them and their music.  :)
B001FB5634|4.0|Do you want to die? No, it is foolish to ask for luxuries in this world. (Question by Viggo Mortensen's character to Robert Duvall's, with the answer)<br /><br />I am not an admirer of McCarthy's writing. I find it much overrated. I tried two of his novels and categorized them as `style over substance'. I disliked the movie `No Country for Old Men' and got a lot of flak here for saying so. Why did I watch The Road at all? Out of spite? Mainly out of curiosity, and then a general interest in the genre: some kind of apocalypse has happened, and then what? We have a fusion of the lonely island genre of Crusoe & Co with the science fiction specialty of the post-apocalyptic world, like in Mad Max or in I am Legend.<br /><br />In summary: this film is much better than I expected. Can one make an interesting movie based on nothing but tristesse and hunger and cold and hostile nature and the assumption that anything alive will try to eat you? Yes, one can, if one has this Danish madman Viggo Mortensen for the main part. An absolutely brilliant performance.<br />There is not much of a plot, it is a linear tale and there are few surprises. A father walks southwards to the sea in a wintry desolation after almost everyone else has died. Food is hard to find, shelter is often dangerous, any other homo sapiens is mainly suspicious and dangerous. Animals seem to have been eradicated in a wholesale way.<br /><br />I would propose that you turn off your DVD or walk out of the movie theatre 5 minutes before the end, but I can't tell you why I propose that, for spoiler control reasons. Only so much: another nice bit part for Guy Pearce. (Is the man out of leading parts?)
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|I'm not going to talk about the movie at all because you must have been under the biggest rock ever to not have heard about it by now.    But as far as the blu ray version goes...I was very skeptical at first when people said it was worth buying even if you had previous versions, but I'm happy to report it looks awesome! Sure, it's a 20+ year old movie and never looked that great to begin with, but they really did a fantastic job in the transfer. Looks spectacular in HD! The sound is also very good. I have the criterion collection version on DVD so I didn't really want to waste any money buying yet another copy that is only marginally better in picture. However, this version is a LOT better. Highly recommend if you're a fan. I did manage to find it for under $13 though on sale at a major big box store this week which is a stellar deal. It's a movie I love but don't watch as often as I'd like to anymore. So buying a new version every couple of years gives me the excuse to sit down and watch it once again :) Verdict, noticeably better than any other previous version for picture quality and sound.

B002RSDW80|5.0|If there was ever any doubt about arguably the most talented actress in the history of film, Meryl Streep erases it with this performance--a characterization of such startling verisimilitude that any aspiring actress sensitive to what she accomplishes--with voice and phrasing, posture and movement, facial and vocal nuance--should immediately perish the very thought of pursuing the profession.  It's like a neophyte pianist who, upon hearing Art Tatum, vows on the spot never to practice the instrument again let alone go after a career in music.  (Of course, there will always be those \\"new-age,\\" \\"creative\\" players who compose original songs based on 3 triads  and who, upon hearing Tatum, are clueless to not merely his genius but the repertory of standards that he plays).<br /><br />Not that it's a perfect performance. At times Streep's Julia verges on caricature, not because she overacts but because she's filmed--through camera positioning, angle, props, supporting actors, etc.--to appear as though she's at least 6' 8\\" rather than 6' 2\\".  But watching her perform in effect makes all else--direction, camera work, score, co-actors, even script--of secondary performance.  Of course it helps to have seen her in previous roles, ranging from \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\" to \\"Prairie Home Companion.\\"<br /><br />It's more than the French setting and the jump cutting between France and the U.S. that causes \\"Julie & Julia\\" to bring to mind, more than any other film, Bernard Tavernier's \\"Round Midnight,\\" the best film about jazz to date.  It's difficult to say which is the more difficult to film--the making and tasting of food or the creation and enjoyment of music.  Tavernier succeeds by framing the story of an ex-patriot, ex-junkie jazz musician (played by jazz great, tenor saxophonist \\"long tall\\" Dexter Gordon) within the narrative of a French jazz devotee who will go to any length first to hear his hero play and then to insure that his alcoholic, addicted American jazz hero has every opportunity to draw one more breath for one more precious note.  By seeing the utter and complete devotion of the fan to  what would otherwise appear to most as the ordinary music of a decrepit musician, the spectator comes to hear the music and its importance all the more acutely.  In \\"Julie &  Julia,\\" Amy Adams as Julie serves much the same function, leaving no doubt about the importance of Julia along with the centrality of cooking and eating to living and loving.<br /><br />The film is about lips and mouths, chewing and kissing--not necessarily \\"romantically,\\" since the story begins with two married couples (practically a first).  Yet it works, at least for this viewer, to a degree not seen in \\"Babette's Feast.\\"  That film, like some others, uses food as metaphor for service and grace; this film, on the other hand, settles for singular good food and its sublime sensual enjoyment, presenting it unapologetically rather than pretending that it's symbolic of some other idea or that it's marginal to human experience.  As the film makes all too clear, food is more than our survival: to quote Julie (who sees herself as a \\"foodie,\\" it's our salvation.<br /><br />[Husband Alert! (since most will watch this movie only with their wives): Julia's husband, Paul, is inarguably the most perfect husband ever to appear on the silver screen--not tall and handsome but an unfailingly adoring, selfless, supportive (and virile) mate who, if he hasn't been fantasized by a spouse prior to this film, will certainly become every female spouse's standard of an ideal to which few if any of us can measure up.  The male spectator's only saving grace is Julie's husband, who becomes a bit of a slacker, even abandoning his wife during her cooking obsession.

B00005MNP7|5.0|Released after Blondie's first American number one (Heart of Glass in early 1979), EAT TO THE BEAT sounds like a band bursting with confidence.  True, PARALLEL LINES was more eclectic and arguably had better songs, but EAT TO THE BEAT's strength lines in its singular sound, propelled by Clem Burke's son-of-Keith-Moon drumming.    Drenched in studio echo, Burke's bass and snare drums leap out of the speakers, starting with the opening bars of DREAMING.  They continue to dazzle with THE HARDEST PART, UNION CITY and particularly SHAYLA.  Those first four songs plus the infectious ATOMIC (a UK number one) define the sound of a band that feels like it's walking on air.  Indeed, they were one of the hottest bands on the planet.  Add to that catchy melodies and sharp, yet supple vocals by Debbie Harry.  EAT TO THE BEAT is the sound of Manhattan's Studio 54 c.1979: cool, assured, urban, focussed, and tough.    True, not every song is great.  VICTOR verges on the comic with its quasi-Medieval backing vocals by the boys  SOUND-A-SLEEP is so long that it can put you to sleep.  However, SLOW MOTION is a charming homage to the girl groups of the early-60s.  EAT TO THE BEAT is perhaps the hardest and fastest song the group has recorded.  DIE YOUNG STAY PRETTY is a white-man's version of reggae, but it's no better or worse than say Led Zeppelin's Dyermaker.  It's plain ole fun.    My brain tells me that PARALLEL LINES is Blondie's best album, but my gut screams EAT TO THE BEAT.  This album energizes me whenever I hear it.  Play loud.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I pre-ordered the DVD and we watched it as soon as we received it. Laughed, cried, laughed some more. Bullock is outstanding in her performance and her supporting cast was excellent. I enjoyed Kathy Bates role as Michael's tutor, and Jae Head's performance as her son. Best movie we have seen in a long time. Bullock's award was well deserved.
B0035FQ1UU|2.0|OK, I could maybe believe the limo scene but after that it goes downhill in a hurry. First of all, if I want to watch a disaster movie, at least make the peripheral parts believable.    First of all, we have an unlicensed pilot with one lesson fly a twin engine plane with 4 passengers to Montana from California then make a perfect 3 point landing on a primitive supposedly secret uncharted airstrip..AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN NO WAY NO HOW!    Then at the end, we have 2 or 3 arks or whatever (I lost interest by that time) built high up in the Himalayas or wherever by the Chinese. So tell me how you were going to build such large sophisticated machinery that these arks obviously were supposed to be in a remote area with primitive mountain roads as the only means of hauling large heavy equipment?    Watch this movie for the terrific CG graphics and forget the rest of the nonsensical story line.

0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" is one my all-time favorite science fiction novels.  In this book, Card tells the story of young Ender, a boy-genius selected into the International Fleet to go through years of intensive military training.  The human race, after being attacked twice by an alien species called the Buggers, about which we know almost nothing, has militarized itself to prepare for the next war for survival.    I have read this book three times, at three different stages in my life, and gotten something different from it on each reading.  On one level \\"Ender's Game\\" is an interesting story of a future in which the human race is embroiled in struggle for survival against an alien civilization.  The story poses difficult moral questions about genocide and the moral standing of foreign races.  On another level, this story describes the loss of innocence of a young boy thrust into an unforgiving system of military training, and the necessary sacrifices of our youth for our race's survival.      This is an excellent, easy-to-read story that has an impact on many different levels.  Although Card continued the story of Ender through many more novels, this one stands head-and-shoulders above the rest.
4770030088|5.0|The best all around series for serious at home learners.  This book will teach you the very basics.  It does not get very in depth about grammar and such.  However, if you are just beginning and have little to no Japanese language experience this will get your feet wet and leave you with a basic understanding of the language and the ability to speak and understand some basics as well.     I was very ambitious, as I want to really learn the language well, and tried some of the larger more in-depth texts.  For at home learning they were simply overwhelming.  After completing this series I am now going back to them for more advanced study and they are much easier to understand and use now.    I recommend for the serious learner to also use [[ASIN:4770030347 Japanese for Busy People I: Workbook; includes CD (Bk. 1)]] and [[ASIN:4770030371 Japanese for Busy People: Kana Workbook Incl. 1 CD]] (This teaches you to read and write Hiragana and Katakana) if you are willing to spend the extra money also get [[ASIN:4770030096 Japanese for Busy People I: Kana Version includes CD (Japanese for Busy People Series) (Bk. 1)]] (This has the same content as the Romanized text book, but written in Kana) which will reinforce the your Kana skills but you will not be able to use it until you have begun to learn Kana first.    If you wish to continue with the series, as I highly recommend, you MUST learn Kana as [[ASIN:477003010X Japanese for Busy People II: Third Revised Edition incl. 1 CD (Bk. 2)]] and [[ASIN:4770030118 Japanese for Busy People III: Third Revised Edition incl. 1 CD (v. 3)]] are both in Kana.  Good luck and have fun!  FYI- This series was developed by AJALT a group created by the Ministry of Education in Japan.

1932100660|4.0|The book is easy to read even if the basic point is repeated over and over with emphasis.  His argument is so well documented that is difficult to ignore the reasoning and logic. His main claim is that an animal-based diet causes diseases...while a plant-based diet does not.    However, it is hard to undo a lifetime of habits.  I always felt that eating protein kept me from being hungry and kept my blood sugars even.  Now I am forced to look at animal products differently and am beginning to recognize how well one can feel by limiting their role in a healthy diet.
B002WY65VU|3.0|I know Zombieland is more of a comedy than a real zombie movie, but they did everything right for two thirds of the film.  This movie was absolutely BUTT KICKINGLY AWESOME from the beginning until you get to the final act.  The characters are real and smart and full of surprises.  It doesn't matter if the whole thing is poking fun at zombie lore.  They did it in an intelligent way.  We loved this film!  LOVED IT!!!  But then... it's the end of the world.  The dead have risen.  So you decide to drive into the heart of Los Angeles, one of the biggest, most sprawling cities on the face of the planet.  Why?  Are you worried about the 10 million zombies you'll find there?  No.  All you want to do is go to  Disneyland where you leave all of the gates open, then power up all the big blinking super loud rollercoasters and ferris wheels and blast happy music at full volume while you hang out and ride the rides while 18000 zombies surround you from all sides.  Duh!!!  IDIOTS!!!!!!  It wasn't funny.  It was dumb.  Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.  And this decision was made by a lady who says just minutes before she runs off to enjoy the free rides, \\"We're going to do anything to survive.\\"  Right.  The movie saves itself a little bit with topnotch action sequences for the big finale, but we walked away wondering why they couldn't have written a better climax.  It was just stupid.

0451209338|3.0|This book was great in a lot of respects. Fantastic plot, page-turning suspense, fresh take on the spy genre, believable tactics by Israeli intelligence.    What was completely laughable however was his use of the 'supermodel' as a spy. Please, no Israeli agent would use for a covert operation a woman whose face is plastered all over magazines and billboards for more than a decade. And no woman like that would prostitute herself for just about any cause.  And let's talk about Sarah / Jacqueline / Dominique. How trite could Silva make her: first, she prostitutes herself. Second, she was a model so therefore she had a cocaine addiction and (of course) lost of all her money (of course) made modeling.    When the truth is most models today are brilliant businesswomen and quite savvy. The women he's writing about may have existed in the Ken Follet / Sydney Sheldon spy era (she certainly seemed highly derivative), but that was the 1970s and 1980s. Newsflash: women have evolved. In short, she became a pathetic character, despite how strong Silva tried to make her with a heroic few acts in the end.    So boo on the female caricature, but if you can manage to ignore the ridiculous choices he made for her, a decent read.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The driving force behind this film isn't the action, which is predictable and a bit over-the-top; nor is it the plot, which is ludicrous even by Doyle's latter-day standards.  The reason to see this film, the sole reason, is the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, who nail their characters perfectly. Downey imbues Holmes with the intellectual charisma we've all come to know, with the raw physicality that is only hinted at in the stories.  Law's Watson is a feisty man himself, smart and witty and not afraid to shoulder his share of the burden (we often forget that Watson was a veteran and rather intellectual himself).  The two bounce off each other marvelously; their one-liners are so sharp, it's hard not to suspect a bit of improvisation on their part.<br /><br />Why?  Because the rest of the script sags so horribly, the film itself doesn't keep up under repeated viewings.  The plot revolves around Holmes and Watson investigating the death--and subsequent resurrection--of Lord Blackwood, a serial killer who claims to have the powers of the dark side.  As Blackwood, Mark Strong is sneering and menacing; unfortunately, he's given little else to do.  Strong himself is a supremely talented actor, but he's got absolutely nothing to work with.  The same goes for Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler (very little comparison to the original Adler), who serves as Holmes's female foible and nothing more.  Some will view her as a strong female protagonist; rightfully, we should see her as filler, which is a shame, because McAdams deserves much better.<br /><br />Still, when it comes to delightfully mindless action, you could do worse that Guy Ritchie's take on the Sherlock Holmes mythology.  And the film definitely sets itself up for a sequel, which I'll be seeing (assuming Downey and Law are on board).  This is the start of a franchise that probably won't get any better, but could definitely be a whole lot worse.  For traditionalists and purists, stick with Basil Rathbone; this film will just frustrate you.  For all others, hopefully this will encourage to seek out older film versions; and hopefully, if there's any hope for humanity (and I tend to be pessimistic on that point), then you'll even go out and read the stories.ll just frustrate you.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|Scorsese is fond of old Hollywood and genre pictures. Although hard core Scorsese fans prefer his more original work, his remakes like Cape Fear tend to appeal to filmgoers who might not usualy go to see a \\"Scorsese\\" picture.<br /><br />Those who like the film are speaking of the way the film messes with your sense of reality but then so do films like Kubrick's The Shining and just about everything else in the psychological suspense/horror genre.<br /><br />This is psychological suspense amped up with a good dose of gothic horror. Scorsese is certainly bending genres here, but the content is pretty typical of those genres that he borrows from--good v. evil, trauma induced identity crisis, alternate realities as coping mechanisms for the horrors of the real one.<br /><br />I'll admit that the film does some masterful (CGI enhanced) things to create mood & atmosphere but I think most film fans want something more than a thrill ride from this filmmaker.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Oprah may be fine as a talk show host, but she doesn't have the depth or presence to carry a documentary as stunning as Life. I have no idea why Discovery of BBC would have allowed or accepted such a move. She narrates as if she is speaking down to a group of small children, and her delivery is overwrought and wooden. Get the David Attenborough version, for narration worthy of the awesome footage.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|When the late Anthony Minghella (1954-2008) made a film, you knew it would have a handful of things in common with every other Minghella film:<br /><br />1. A serpentine story, usually told across years or decades.<br />2. A love story turned tragic.<br />3. Themes not far below the radar of the main story.<br />4. The potential for award-winning performances.<br /><br />\\"The Reader,\\" Minghella's final film before his March 2008 the resutl of a post-surgery hemorrhage, represents all these trends in his earlier films. Like The English Patient [[ASIN:B0001WTWCO The English Patient (Miramax Collector's Edition)]], it won a major award (Kate Winslet's best actor Oscar), involved a tragic love story, had a winding story told over decades, beginning 1995, going back to the 1960s, then forward again, and involved World War II. Like Cold Mountain [[ASIN:B0001MDP3G Cold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], it had a tragic love story and was about war (the Civil War in the case of Cold Mountain.) Like Michael Clayton [[ASIN:B00121QGPY Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)]] and The Talented Mr. Ripley [[ASIN:0792165020 The Talented Mr. Ripley]], it dealt with themes that transcended the main narrative.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\", taken from Bernhard Schlink's novel of the same name [[ASIN:0307473465 The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)]], is Ralph Fiennes character, a fellow (Michael Berg) that, in his teens, meets and has an affair with an older woman (Winslet playing Hannah Schmidt in her award-winning role.) He's called that because he reads books to Schmidt, first during their affair in postwar Germany during the 1960s, and later when he sends her books on tape while she is serving a prison sentence.<br /><br />The reader's role in this film is essential to the subterranean themes that dominate the Schmidt character. A German, Schmidt becomes a member of the Nazi SS during the war and takes part in a pogrom of Jewish women and children. When tried for the crime, her court testimony indicates she had no option but to do this because she was programmed in life to do exactly as told. This typical Nazi theme carries over to all parts of her life -- first as a ticket puncher on a railway car and, later, as the willing participant in the affair with the younger man.<br /><br />Her roles in both places are described for her by the other participants in her life, not by her. She demonstrates a near total lack of initiative and personal decision-making. At one point in the trial, the judge asks why she allowed all the prisoners to die. \\"What else was I to do?\\" she replied. \\"They'd have escaped otherwise. What would you have done.\\" The \\"reader\\" also does something for her she cannot -- read. This terrible secret, Hannad Schmidt's illiteracy, also forms the basis for everything that happens in her life.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" is an involving film that forces viewers to re-examine old ideas about good and evil and the differences between personal and national will. Winslet's performance is marvelous, always credible and two-dimensional even though she is the victim of poor makeup work late in the movie that works against her. She is not a fully developed human being but more comprehensive than the usual Nazi criminal. Ralph Fiennes, who is not a great actor but always gets great roles, seems both sympathetic to her and abhorrent to her at times in the movie. The fellow that plays his role as a teenager and young man, David Kross, is more convincing and has the meatier part of the role to play during Schmidt's trial for war crimes.<br /><br />This film is worth buying and watching though it lacks the package that made \\"The English Patient\\" the Oscar winner for best movie in 1996. In a world full of flicks made on a dime with no thought whatsoever given to what they are going to say, \\"The Reader\\" tells a story and is full of ideas and conflicts you may not have seen in cinema previously. It's a fine film but, like all thelate Minghella's movies, it is doomed to be tragic. Sad for that, although perhaps his final film told his own end as well.lthough perhaps his final film told his own end as well.
B000RO9PXC|2.0|I think I would enjoy this CD more if they had simply deleted Jim Morrison's vocal tracks entirely.  Ray, Robbie and John do their usual outstanding job with the music, but Jim is so drunk that he trashes the whole show.  He's not particularly coherent in his banter and most importantly, his state of intoxication is so severe that he can't even sing really.  His vocal range has shrunk to barely an octave, and he cops out on every single high note; with the exception of a few trademark shrieks (most of which he flubs), he delivers a performance that is monotonous and lackluster at best, and downright embarrassing at worst.  He sounds like what he basically was at this point - a mumbling, washed up drunk and a shadow of his brilliant self from just a few years prior.<br /><br />I excitedly purchased this concert CD the day it was released and was utterly dismayed when I listened to it.  A few more listens have not changed my first impression.  The three real musicians in the band must have engaged in some serious soul searching and career contemplation during shows like this; Ray, Robbie and John all turn in first-rate performances only to have the whole package ruined by the drunk idiot at the mic.  As a longstanding Doors fan for the past 30 years, I felt gypped by Morrison's half-a$$ed performance.  It would have sounded better if Jim had just passed out and Ray had sung instead.<br /><br />This CD offers a vivid example of the ravages of alcohol and drug abuse, and a sad testament to Jim Morrison's stupid waste of his talent and ultimately his life.<br /><br />I don't know what any of the other newly-issued concert archives sound like but this one sucks.  Again, the BAND plays extremely well, but Jim is so weak it spoils the party.

1571200851|5.0|I purchased Fantastic Fabric Folding by Rebecca Wat when I was looking for ways to use what I knew of origami in different and novel ways.  It is a lovely book, and I enjoyed it very much.  While I was not always impressed with the author's projects or with her choice of fabrics--which I thought were often rather dull--I  was very impressed with some of the designs and uses for the folded objects (usually flowers) themselves.  My favorites were Ms Wat's Inside-out (pp. 24-32) and Polygon Flowers (pp. 49-74).<br /><br />While, as I said, I'm not certain I'd use these in quite the way Ms Wat does--she appears to be a professional quilter, which I am not, with all the patience that that implies--I can definitely see myself using them for simpler projects of my own.  I have a good friend who invites me to all her family holiday dinners, and who enjoys decorating her table for the occasion.  I plan to make a table runner for her using the book for both my inspiration and my instruction.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money.
B0035V35P8|5.0|There's hardly anything bad I can say about the movie... I loved it! It was awsome! With all the cheesy \\"Ninja\\" movies done over the years finally one that puts an entirely new spin on the concept. 5 Stars! There so many ways they could have gone wrong with this film... but everything they did was so right! Watching this you almost think that ninja's are supernatural they way they are portrayed in this film... which is close enough to what people thought about them durring the era when they actually existed and were active. Absolutely awsome flick! Nothing to say but watch it for yourself!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|[[ASIN:0756982863 Fantastic Mr. Fox]], a children's book by Roald Dahl, is the basis for this stop animation film featuring the voices of George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox.  A good choice for an entertaining family film, but some of the humor will go over younger viewers heads.  Where adults would say a 'bad word', the writers have the characters simply say 'cuss'.  As an adult viewing the film, I found this really funny because my head naturally put to mind what words 'I' would use in a similar situation!<br /><br />Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cute story of about a fox who upon learning of his wife's pregnancy with their first kit agrees to give up his profession \\"stealing chickens\\" and settle down into a more sedate life as a columnist.  All is well until 12 fox years later when Mr. Fox becomes unsettled by his 'poor' lifestyle and decides to go against the promise that he made to his wife.  He convinces his landlord (a possum) to join him in a heist, and it feels so go he goes for another... and another... and another.  Eventually this risky behavior puts Mr. Fox, his family and the other friends (creatures who share his life) in danger from the three disgruntled farmers from whom he's been stealing.<br /><br />The animation is different than anything in recent memory and a nice divergence from the digital animation we are all now used to viewing.  It's neat to see the animals fur and feel like you could touch it.  It's also kind of weird to see them run and get taller and/or smaller depending upon the scene, but after awhile you get used it it and immerse yourself in the story.<br /><br />Fun music, sharp dialogue done by actors we love, a fun story done in a new way, made Fantastic Mr. Fox an enjoyable movie for my family.  I'd recommend it!
1932100660|1.0|I tried to read this book with an open mind, I really tried. I got as far as the blatant pot-kettleism between the nitrite studies and Campbell's own casein study and the diagram portraying cancer as Pac-Man with sharp teeth and then had to put it down.    D. Tosh, Joseph DeMarinis, and other reviewers have done a good job picking apart the obvious errors and propaganda in this book so I won't repeat them. Suffice it to say that if you think anything in this book provides a scientific basis for vegetarianism or veganism you are sadly mistaken.    If you don't eat anything containing animal products due to your moral views, great, good for you. But propagating obvious errors and outright lies because they happen to agree with your personal biases is not \\"science,\\" in fact it's the polar opposite of science.

0143038419|3.0|This was a very good book. I enjoyed it and it is very entertaining and well written.  Two items that jumped out at me were:<br /><br />I found it interesting (like only an intellectual perspective can tell) that she actually went and chose worldly travel to seek and find God.  Any faithful person can tell you that faith and God are inside us all....not \\"out there\\" somewhere to be found??? If she is a theologian of sorts or other authority I would give a pass, but she seemed to me as just a woman running away.<br /><br />Second, her journey was backwards.  She started in Italy to only eat, get fat and learn Italian. What faith outreach was reached here? Fast forward all of civilization (not just Western) and maybe she should have started with the witchdoctors of Indonesia and ended with Christ within the last two thousand years of the faith journey here on earth. I found this a bit odd.<br /><br />I see she now also finds herself an authority on marriage for the self-absorbed modern-mind set.  I think I will kindly take a pass on this and let her keep running right on by me! :)
B001OQCV6K|1.0|The movie is great! What stinks is being force fed the 3 format edition and the inflated price!   I have waited this long so I will continue to wait for the single Blu-Ray edition or that they discount the current offering!  I have Blu-Ray for a reason, and do not buy standard dvd resolution dvds anymore!

B0010X8NF0|1.0|I usally enjoy Wes Anderson's movies.  I Loved Royal Tenenbaums and also enjoyed Life Aquatic to a good degree.   Unfortunately The Darjeeling Limited features none of the charm or fun of those previous films.  The movie is just dull from beginning to end.  The characters are boring and uninteresting.  They are not likeable or relatable in any way.  Quirky should also be fun, but this movie is just quirky for it's own sake and it fails to entertain.  I literally did not laugh once while sitting through this.  My mother actually fell asleep during most of it.  This is a film to avoid at all costs, unless you suffer from severe insomnia, then it may just do the trick.
1582701709|1.0|This book claims that optimism will solve all life problems. This is the most ridiculous claim I have encountered for a long time. In rare occasions where the situation is laid out such that your attitude determines the outcome, this might work - however, these scenarios are so rare that the unrealistic outlook presented by this book is not worth mentioning in isolation.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have read the book and find that most of the the script is taken directly from the book. It would be difficult to include everything into this movie but they picked the best parts to add. I thought the acting was incredible, both Mr Thornton and Margaret are very expressive with their eyes, it shows how they feel. Some comments have been made at Daniela (Margaret) being dry or not showing emotion BUT that is how she is in the book! You can see that she has feeling for Mr Thorton but that she tries to keep them reserved. This was a GREAT adaption and I loved the actors in it. The cast was OUTSTANDING every one of them!
B001OQCV2O|4.0|This a a Roland Emmerich movie. So it's just a popcorn/'suspend all belief' type movie. I like most of his movies (still can't sit thru 10,000BC) & know well what to expect. Story wise this movie is all over the place, just a series of vignettes to propel us to the astounding special effects scenes. And what special effects, this blu ray is a reference quality disc. The seamless intergration of real/CGI is jaw-dropping. Sound quality is top notch with every explosion/debris perfectly set in motion.<br />Overall, it makes for great entertainment but don't expect anything deeper than a 'eye candy' buffet.
140272666X|3.0|This version of Frankenstein, Classic Starts: Frankenstein, presents the reader with the original story, taking some liberties because of the targeted reading audience. (For example, the monster kills little WIlliam.  In this version it is portrayed as an accident because the monster tried to keep William quiet, while in the original, the monster grabbed William by the throat.)  Although the original version is difficult to read because of the dense style of writing, this version lacks the romantic charm of the original text.  It does, however, allow the younger reader or poorer reader to access the story and learn the true story of Frankenstein, not the Hollywood movie version.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />It hit me about midway through the movie that there were two possible endings to this film. One, the story is as it is told from the outset - he's a detective that has uncovered some horrible Nazi-like mind experiments of mental patients on Shutter Island; or two, he himself is crazy, and this is all just an elaborate story he has created in his mind. I was happy with the ending we got, but I thought it would have been a nice twist at the end to leave it sort of unknown whether he was really crazy or whether they had simply succeeded in convincing him that he's crazy, and Shutter Island really is a place that carries out these horrible experiments.<br /><br />The story itself is good though a bit slow moving for a thriller of this type, and not entirely original. For those that have seen \\"Identity\\" (2003) or \\"Memento\\" (2000) this movie treads on similar ground, especially similar to \\"Identity\\" where the \\"hero\\" of that film actually turns out to be a killer with multiple personalities. However, this film brings a certain philosophical debate to the idea of being \\"crazy\\" that the other aforementioned films did not. As DiCaprio's character says at the end of the film \\"is it better to an alive murderer or a dead hero?\\"
B00337KM2S|2.0|Yikes.  I was really looking forward to seeing this much discussed film.  My review will not help the review of my reviews in general, since most folks seem to like it.    The premise is fascinating.  The execution seemed to me two-dimensional and predictable.  The writing had a couple of good moments, but most of it was wooden and \\"mannered\\"--not the way real people actually talk (except for the real people actually in the film).    George Clooney's acting is likewise self-conscious and two-dimensional--as though he is always looking in the mirror, watching himself being the actor, George Clooney.  Maya F. who plays Alex, is a far more natural actor, and contributed the single memorable performance in the film.  She also had better lines and a wider range to work with, so that certainly helped.    It's too bad that such a potentially interesting film turned out almost never to leave George Clooney's head and enter the world in which he works, which supports the work he does, and which includes the actual other people with whom he interacts.  Ironically, the air bubble in which he exists would have stood out much more vividly, and interestingly, if there had been more in the film ... besides air bubbles.

B0016BWACI|5.0|The timeless excellence of this fantasy classic has been well-described over the decades, so instead this quick little review will just make notes regarding the recent blu-ray incarnation.<br /><br />Put simply, the film overall looks incredibly sharp, colorful, and vibrant.  Swords gleam with the sharpest of edges, the most exquisite details of the often ornate clothing become clear, forests burst in luxuriant green.  The age of the film is still treated with appropriate respect, as film grain can be seen in wider outside daytime shots that always make it more visible, as well as occasional flat grey-suffused zones where background art was later overlaid.  I can't imagine a better balance in bringing an older movie to--not just adequate, but top-flight--blu-ray quality while staying so true to the original state.<br /><br />Audio is also nicely improved in terms of clarity for the blu-ray, though there is less opportunity for improvement here than for the visuals.  In addition, a great many welcome extras complete the package.  Highlights from the past include the nearly one-hour archival documentary \\"The World of the Dark Crystal\\", an aged but still entertaining and thorough look behind the scenes of the original film production.<br /><br />Finally, there are a few blu-ray specific extras.  Best of these is the superb \\"Storyboard Track - Picture-in-Picture\\" function, wherein panels will pop onscreen (such as \\"Concept Art - The Castle of the Crystal\\") to provide background info or concept art for immediate comparison to the currently playing scene.

0312427999|1.0|Naomi Klein is notorious for her somehow unbalanced view of herself and the world at large. She created a reputation for being pro-Islam in all matters where the Western civilization is in conflict with the followers of Muhammad the last prophet on earth. In other words, she sells us plenty of B.S. such as \\"the burkah is really not that uncomfortable as most people think\\" - to quote but one of her infamous pearls.<br /><br />In the \\"Shock doctrine\\" she is trying to promote more of her old and too often recycled ideas no one truly accepts. There are her cohorts, of course, trying to defend her absurd posture and strange ideas, but no one seems to follow such lead. At any rate, save your hard-earned money and buy a book about economy in general written by a competent and serious professional - something Naomi Klein is not and never was.
0393072231|5.0|When the NYT book section said if you wanted one book about the financial crisis, this should be it, I was frankly skeptical.  But Michael Lewis can tell a story and get his financial facts straight, so I gave it a try.  It is just excellent.  Every writer has to find a balance between drama and substance (a little technical here), and Lewis finds it. So if you want some unusual people profiled along with an easy introduction to what really went wrong, this is your book. To those who lost so much money for their stockholders, the government and all the rest of us, he is if anything too kind.  But the facts are there. The pace is fast.  And the story is the story of our times.
0061703087|4.0|I liked this book, altho I felt he did too much explaining of concepts involved in nanotechnology. He managed to work it in well enough, and I don't know how he could have told the story without it, but it was a bit to chew. The story is cliched, yet there are certainly unthinking corporate people who make bad decisions about dangerous technology. I could have done without all the domestic detail, the sister babysitting, the kids duking it out. Still, a fast read and recommended for a plane ride or beach weekend.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|I first saw There Will Be Blood without knowing anything about the plot or who was in it. I'm kind of glad I did it that way now, because nearly every review you read has people on one of two sides: that it's pure genius and one of the best movies of all time, or that it's boring and nothing happens. I can totally see where the bored crowd is coming from, since this really is a movie where nothing really happens. It's more of a character study than it is of anything else, despite what plot summaries may lead you to believe. As for it being one of the best movies ever made...I can't quite say that, though it definitely is in my personal top 10.    Daniel Plainview is running an oil business. Oil and money are the main things that make him live. He has a son of sorts (a baby he took in from an employee who was killed on the job) named H.W., and together they go around getting the trust of towns to let Daniel drill on their land. When he starts to really get things going, he encounters a bit of a road block- a young boy named Eli who's the definition of 'crazy Christian', who can see Daniel for who he is, and also wants in on the money.    That's the basic plot summary, but the majority of this movie revolves around Daniel and showing just how far he'll go to get what he wants. Murdering people isn't a big deal as long as it means making more money, and he even goes so far as to get baptised in Eli's church to win over one man who wouldn't let Daniel drill in his area unless he joined the church. As the movie continues, Daniel essentially snaps and becomes consumed by his hatred. THAT'S what the movie's really about. Eli's in the movie for a good while, but not even half of the run time when it comes down to it. Personally, even with this movie being as long as it is, with 'nothing happening' since it's very dialogue driven, I loved it. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, and I'll never forget the name of Daniel Plainview. Even peopleI know who were bored out of their minds watching this remember the character's name because he did that great of a job with the character. Paul Dano does excellent as well, making you hate him whenever he opens his mouth, and especially when he tries to be seen as a prophet.    There are many long shots where the camera will just pan around or very, very slowly zoom in, and the first 15-20 minutes of the movie is sure to test anyone's patience if they're a casual movie watcher. Don't think I'm one of those artsy movie buffs, I can't stand those types, and I won't call the director a genius, but the fact that I wasn't bored for a second while watching this really says something, where I'm the kind of person who wants story progression at a steady pace and no slow spots. If you're looking for action, this movie doesn't have much aside from an incredible fire scene, some people getting shot, a short fight and of course the final scene that even people who haven't seen the movie know about. I also have to give credit to Johnny Greenwood for providing the film's score. For a period piece, there's a lot of experimental music, and his track titled Convergence was used flawlessly here. If I had to say anything bad about the movie, it's that I would've liked some more closure on things, mostly because so many people argue if the ending was a dream, in Daniel's head or real.    For the blu-ray, this is a standard release, matching the quality of the dvd in every aspect, but slightly better for obvious reasons. So I won't waste time there, but things do look and sound good. Audio is in English, Spanish and French, as are the subtitles if you need them. The special features are all the same as those on the special edition 2 disc dvd set. You get the pictures and research featurette for the making of the movie, the trailers, the Fishing bit, the haircut and interrupted hymn deleted scene, and the Dailies Gone Wild feature. Finally, there's the History of Petroleum short film,made in the 1920s, and eventhough it seems a little out of place here, it's worth a watch, especially since they did such a good job of cleaning up the picture quality for it. The main complaint anyone who cares for special features is that there's no commentary track. I hear Paul Thomas Anderson isn't big on those, and I can respect that. But for everyone whining about the ending, I'd appreciate it if he would just come out and confirm the ending so it can be put to rest. I don't think he'd be one of those 'every movie should be like Fight Club' kind of people.    I doubt a special edition or anniversary set will come out for this movie with the commentary track that everyone wants, so as it is, this blu-ray gets a 3 out of 5 from me. But the movie- the most important thing, gets a 5. Just know what you're getting into before you rent or buy it. This is a character study, plain and simple. But it's a damn good one with one of the finest performances ever, and Daniel Day-Lewis earned every bit of that Best Actor award for his portrayal as Daniel Plainview.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This is a great movie with really good animation. The storyline follows the path of traditional fairytales, and it is different than the fairytale it's based on. My only problem with the movie is that Tiana's only wears her dressed for a very short amount of time at the end, and I wish the end had showed more of after they were turned back human.    I used the digital copy for my iPod, and it worked fine. The blu-ray has more special features than the dvd. I was pleasantly surprised to find that dvd had special features (including Disney Princess game hosted by Mama Odie). On another Disney blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy combo I got, the dvd was just the movie with no special features.

The box is a must have for any Britney or anyone who just knows that the collection is full of great songs and music from our generations most beloved artist. one major flaw i noticed is, that the box just fits it perfectlty and yet it is a bit to tightly packaged. it makes it hard to get discs in and out but still it is a GREAT item to own, I am so glad I got one!!
B000NY12CI|5.0|Infidel is one of the most shocking books I have ever read and knowing her story is a must. Ayaans story is a recent story that recounts unknown suffering and calls us to take action. Ayaan is brave and courageous and her book is an inspiration. The work that she's been doing ever since she escaped her arranged marriage to Holland is noteworthy.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'm usually into reality shows and comedy. My favs are The Hills, So you think you can dance, American idol, Scrubs, various judge shows, and much more. So when I first saw the commercials for this new show called Legend of the Seeker, I wasn't by any means interested. I just happened to be home the Saturday it premiered when I found the first episode to be rather good. From then on, I would watch when I could on Saturdays although I did miss several episodes bc of work. But every episode I watch made me love it more and more. Then for one reason or another, I missed many episodes in a roll. I noticed then that they were on season 2 and I had no idea what was going on. So I decided to buy Season 1 and good thing I did. I just finished the last episode last night and it was incredible!! I loved all episodes, some more than others, but overall great. I've missed most episodes of season 2, but I will definitely buy on dvd when available.   Most of my friends don't want to give this show a chance because they think it's all like old, boring, crazy wizards and stuff, but it is not boring at all, though it does have a crazy wizard lol. Zed. But if they were to watch it, they'd love it.   And for the girls, Craig Horner, or Richard Cypher on the show, is hot!!!!lol

B000069HZP|5.0|A friend and I first watched The Game during one of Florida's back-to-back hurricanes. It had such an impact on us we now see it once or twice a year and spend hours discussing the film, its meaning and how it reflects what's happening in our lives at the time. We see new meaning and perceive deeper insights on each viewing. What's especially interesting is the playing out of early childhood trauma in adult life. The Game can be enjoyed on many levels, from a exciting thriller to a mind-expanding blow up the side of the head.  Highly recommended for those looking for a excellent film and especially for anyone who appreciates mysticism and/or metaphysics imbedded within popular entertainment.

I have not finished them yet, preferring rather to take my time with them and go through a story or two every few days. But everything I have read so far has been highly enjoyable.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|Not my cup of tea,would recommend to die-hard scifi fans. I should have known since Peter Jackson(Lord of the rings EW!) presents it, and this is a rookie director's first movie(hopefully the last? or no sequel)The movie is not bad, it's just the message that somehow Human beings are bad and greedy. That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.  Second, Yes it's science fiction. but poor science fiction. sorry but I don't want preachy over-lying \\"Anti-Imperialist\\" themes that are so passe.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson  Good characterization throughout, especially with the women. A thriller with layers and layers of subplots, but the central mystery uncovered is about a serial killer. The author creates a truly kickass heroine who may or may not have Aspergers, but who is tattooed and pierced and not someone who will put up with the abuse and mistreatment of women. There's also some friends with benefits type of sexual arrangements between various people which I have not seen in a mainstream thriller. Is this indicative of lifestyle in Sweden, where it's set? One can only hope.<br /><br />Also liked the high-finance description of Swedish corporate life, the look at investigative reporting there, as well as the glance at their judicial system particularly in regard to \\"guardianship.\\"<br /><br />On a side note, we see a lot of the mundane side of life in small town Sweden, and the food that goes with it. The cuisine was abhorrent. I could handle the lamb chops cooked in red wine sauce, but the kipper, cheese and pickle sandwiches I'll skip on a visit there. They drank so much coffee in the book, I felt an attack of acid reflux imminent.<br /><br />The book suffered from poor editing, and the translation seemed stilted in parts. Still, the author kept up the suspense and once we got past the boring details of financial misbehavior, there was sufficient momentum to carry the reader into the real mysteries of the Vanger family's assorted Nazis, social isolates, misogynistic paterfamilias, alcoholics, and cold-hearted mothers.<br /><br />Originally appeared at [...]

0307269981|4.0|In Larsson's first book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, we're introduced to one kickass heroine in the form of the petite and punked-out Lisbeth Salander. She returns in the second book sans one tattoo and her nose ring, but with breast implants.<br /><br />Larsson underlined her boyish appearance in the first book, and the sadistic pedophiles she attracted because of it, so the new boobs are a dramatic departure. On the other hand, they may just be another couple of piercings for her. We are meant to see a softer side of Salander, but don't let her new toys fool you. Once she takes them for a test run with a new guy and an old girlfriend, she's still the same feisty-cum-deadly adversary we've grown to love.<br /><br />Her bisexuality fits right in with the popular freewheeling stereotype of Sweden, but homophobic cops do not, nor do the unequal treatment, sexual harassment, and brutalization of women, especially the psychiatric professionals who have \\"a state-endorsed mandate to tie down disobedient little girls with leather straps.\\"<br /><br />In addition, while Blomkvist, the other central character in both books, is fine with his primary lover, Erica Berger, being married, and she admits to enjoying the occasional m&eacute;nage, even he would never consider a three-way with she and her husband. That just doesn't seem Swedish, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />In Larsson's first book, each chapter was introduced with a statistic of the abuse women suffer in Sweden at the hands of men. Indeed, the original title of that book was \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\" In The Girl Who Played With Fire, big money criminals, petty thugs and a corrupt SAPO (Swedish National Police Board), collide with a thriving sex trade. If sex is so freely available in Sweden, how do prostitutes and their pimps thrive?<br /><br />Larsson gives us a birds-eye view of ordinary middle class people living conventional lives. The other lesson is that purchased sex comes with permission to be brutal, and therefore attracts a certain brand of customer. With the former, we indulge in one of the primary pleasures of foreign fiction - a glimpse at how other people live their lives, but with the latter we get the author's point-of-view through both Salander and Blomkvist.<br /><br />\\"What's right,\\" is something both characters contemplate. Loyalty is at the top of the list for each of them, and Salander is learning about friendship. A major turn for Lisbeth is her growing ability to trust men. Frequent coincidence is an all too convenient authorial device to move the plot forward. Both the police and a private detective agency are a bunch of inept bunglers, but I ignored them because I wanted to find out what happened next.<br /><br />I was hoping that Salander would mete out her particular form of punishment to the bad guys with a full charge of her taser. I was not disappointed. Even without that charming bit of modern technology, Lisbeth is a quick thinker, lithe, and she fights with everything she's got.

B001AEF6D6|4.0|A unique movie. Jeff Bridges fans will love it. He make the role look so easy. Jeff Bridges should have won an oscar for his performance. One of his famous roles. John Goodman as always the perfect gentleman who gives life to all his performances. He matches Bridges scene to scene. Perfect casting. Nice laid-back soundtrack too.  After watching this movie, one realize the importance of recreation and friendships. The dude rules alright. It's worth buying and watching. The special features are great.  Listen to the dude and enjoy life!

B002T9H2L0|1.0|I hate to pan films, but this one was just bad; nothing like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, both of which were great films.The plot was ill-conceived and simply not believable. That the Nazi High Command, including Hitler himself, would all go see a movie in occupied France only to be trapped by a band of vigilante Jewish commandos is almost as fatuous as their all going on a sleigh ride on the Eastern Front and becoming transvestite communists.     And while there clearly were contrived elements of / references to the Spaghetti Western in the movie- if this is Tarantino's \\"homage\\" to the genre he misfired entirely. But beyond being unbelievable, the movie was simply boring. We've always known Quentin was different, and capable of flashes of brilliance (I refer to the 2 movies mentioned above), but it would seem this self-proclaimed genius has finally split from the program. The only 2 good things I can say about this movie are: it wasn't as bad as From Dusk Till Dawn and the characters played by Brad Pitt and the German guy (whose name escapes me) were mildly entertaining. Big disappointment!
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books i've ever read. You don't have to be a dog lover to read it. I was crying on the first page and the last. I didn't want it to end. I can't wait to read it again.
1439190275|5.0|A few years ago I lost a little over 100lbs on Atkins. I continue to follow eating low-carb and have kept the weight off and keep it off this whole time. My health is excellent and I enjoy eating. My doctor has about 50 patients who have followed the diet and have kept the weight off. Several of them HAD diabetes or other health problems that cleared up.    I use to eat the way the USDA stated everyone should eat, and I just got fatter. Maybe eating the way some government nutritionist who has never been fat states is fine when you are already healthy and you eat whole, unprocessed foods. But when you are 100lbs overweight eating 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice or pasta is not good for you.    I bought this book yesterday at Borders and read it in about two hours. It is a good book and I like the fact that it takes the best of the books Dr. Atkins wrote and combines it with new research. There is less emphasis on low-carb products than on other books written by Atkins Nutritional after Dr. Atkins died.    I don't understand why people get so upset with the principles of an Atkins. I have a blood sugar of 65, my blood pressure is 110/65 and my HDL is 80 and my LDL is 20. I will still have someone who follows the USDA diet and is 50lbs overweight telling me I am killing myself with eating a lot of fat. In reality, I am probably eating less `bad' fat, and eating more veggies and fruit than someone following a `healthy' diet.     I have met people who eat low-carb and are not healthy and those that are. I have met vegans that are healthy and those that look sickly and 20 years older looking than they really are. Find what works for you and don't knock what everyone else does.

B0000033PB|5.0|Black Moon has to be one of THE most underrated albums in the history of music. First of all, The timing of the album and its featured sound were out of sync. So what? Evidently, people were listening to alternative in the early 90's, along with grunge. ELP experienced the \\"Boston Effect\\", as that group struggled with sales with their later releases, due to the music being outdated for a particular point in time. Why do people care so much about what's popular? As long as it sounds good, it shouldn't matter WHEN the album came out. ELP gravitated toward a more popish sound for this album, to accomodate what people were listening to in 1992. The result? Alienation of it by disappointed fans. So, what we have is a paradox--no matter which way you turn, fans are unsatisfied. They want an album that's consistent with what's current, along with those who want their old stuff on every album. Now, the songs: These extremely talented guys put out a nice variety of songs to appeal to many people. The title track (while not my favorite) is nonetheless a strong opener. PAPER BLOOD is a fairly solid song that sort of picks up where BLACK MOON left off. AFFAIRS OF THE HEART is a great song, and is one of the few ballads that ELP did, and they pulled it off easily. When listening to this song, you're reminded of just how versatile these guys are. ROMEO AND JULIET is classic ELP in the familiar instrumental capacity. FAREWELL TO ARMS is an awesome display of Greg's vocals. Greg can be a great vocalist--he just has to have the right type of song, and this one showcases his talent best. I will add that Greg does some great acoustic work on this album, as well. CHANGING STATES, BURNING BRIDGES, and BETTER DAYS fall into the same category of pop rock strength songs. They're pop rock with a little more punch. CLOSE TO HOME is classic Emerson on piano, and he does a superb job as usual in this instrumental. The album closes with FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, which features excellent acoustic work by Greg. Again, his voice shines through this one, and reinforces how good he is on the slower songs. Overall, I give this album 9/10. This is 90's ELP, and it's great.work by Greg. Again, his voice shines through this one, and reinforces how good he is on the slower songs.

B002P5XXR0|5.0|I'm just reviewing the song by the amazing Leona Lewis, who has become one of the greatest vocalists of all time, just like Mariah, Celine, and Whitney!!!<br /><br />This song, \\"I See You,\\"  I just cannot put into words how much I adore this song!  It's filled with so much passion and emotion, like her \\"Run\\" masterpiece!  The soundtrack is more than worth the purchase for this song alone.  Oh and the music video is so amazing, it's so magical and enchanting and perfect!!  Please watch the music video on YouTube, it's such a wonderful song and video!!
B002IVLH60|5.0|This was, in my opinion, their best work since Vs.   They remain true to their genre while demonstrating they've matured along the way.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I bought this cd right when it first came out and I have probably listened to it more than a hundred times since then. I'm not lying. I love the music on here and while at first a couple of the songs (specifically the last 5 or so) seemed a bit boring the first time I listened to it, they are now my favorites. I love every song on here and honestly this soundtrack is probably my favorite of all time. I usually don't like soundtracks because they are generally full of silly unoriginal songs with maybe one or two really good ones, but this soundtrack is amazing and the songs are all really unique. I bought the first twilight soundtrack though and enjoyed it so I took a chance on this one and it really paid off. I love every song and the soundtrack has actually inspired me to try listening to some of the bands on the soundtrack I hadn't ever bothered to listen to before like the Editors, Grizzly Bear, Bon Iver, etc. I think my two favorite songs are \\"White Demon Love Song\\" by the Killers, which I think is perfect for the movie and really sums up Bella and Edward's relationship, and \\"No Sound But the Wind\\" by the Editors. Both are amazing. Really though every song is great and I think they definitely fit with the overall tone of the movie. You should definitely buy this soundtrack, you won't be sorry.
0307341569|3.0|Gillian Flynn has given us a novel of very dark proportions, indeed.<br /><br />I cannot say that I liked it, nor am I able to say that I did not find myself anxious to \\"find out what happened\\" either, and I read it through in a fairly short time. However, I found it fractured in its presentation...like a broken mirror...which, while interesting from a construction standpoint, was at the same time hindering in the presentation of the story in a more clear to understand manner. However, I did come to a point where I became caught up in the story and it was sweeping me along in \\"finding out what happened\\" to Ben and the other members of the Day family.<br /><br />Somehow, this story \\"ground down\\" to a feeling of \\"let's surprise them with this\\", and then, \\"let's give them this, too\\", etc., so that so many possibilities of \\"what happened\\" were presented in this same \\"broken mirror\\" style that I was just not ready for the \\"last\\" presentation, which was totally \\"out of whack\\" and unbelievable...just \\"one-too-many\\" surprises! I hated the ending of this book, totally, after having slowly been brought to a place where I eagerly worked \\"to find out what the final results were\\" throughout 2/3 of the story, which had held me, to get to this bogus, sort of \\"pasted on\\" final detour of an ending, which was totally unfitting, I felt for a story of such sad and dark, deeply haunting proportions.<br /><br />Truthfully, this could have been an absolutely breath-stopping \\"horror story\\" had it been edited into a more fitting format of presentation, and re-writing the ending out of the book, and adding one that was more logical, and fitting, for the level of horror that had happened to the Day family.<br /><br />It doesn't wash, folks, save your time and money.

1441419519|5.0|The sources of this book include classics like Nietzche's Thus Spake  Zarathustra, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and elements of Buddhism.  It is the story  of a quest that mirrors the quests of several Indian sages from the Buddha to countless Sadhus since.  It is important to let go of preconceptions when reading this book, it is however probably more suitable to westerners who don't appreciate Indian religions that don't bear comparison with monotheistic traditions that seek salvation using one totem.  Indeed, Hess seems to treat Buddhism just like another totem to be ignored given that as a religion it implies \\"allegiance\\".  Taking refuge with an open mind is not the same as swearing allegiance.  Everyone has to discover realisation/s for themselves.  The Buddha said this.  Leaving this aside, Hess is deeply sympathetic to Buddhism but prefers instead an individualistic path based on love and a simple appreciation of the world, the way many human beings come to terms with suffering.  It is not necessarily the path to the realisation of ultimate truth, but more coming to terms with the problems of life.  I was especially touched by the descriptions of listening to the soothing river.  Chapter after chapter offers various teachers and the book as a whole is about the quest and not necessarily about answers.<br /><br />Philosphically the book is about independence and individualism and makes the case for a lone seeker \\"fare lonely as a rhinoceros\\" as a Buddhits text has it.  This means being wary of any religion or movement and understanding the limits of concepts.  Many of us do have to join groups to come to understand this and it has to be borne in mind that Siddhartha, the protagonist finds his way by forming relationships, not by being entirely alone.  Siddhartha asks questions and is keen to form bonds with sources of wisdom.  In the end, he only has so much time and when he is old he has that much wisdom to offer.  It may not be the whole realisation, but it is what is suitable for most readers of this book.<br /><br />The book is a light and pleasant read and needs to be read slowly with enough time for digestion of each of the chapters.  It is well thought out and enjoyable and though it may not be on the bestseller ranks, it is just the sort of book that someone may need and enjoy.is what is suitable for most readers of this book.

B003AYDPYQ|5.0|I eagerly anticipated the start of season 3 of Breaking Bad.  But I was nervous.  Here in the U.S., we have a tendency to beat TV series into the ground, until they no longer possess the qualities that made us love them in the first place (see, for example, season 6 of The Office).  I was nervous that Breaking Bad would stray from what made it my favorite show of the past few years.<br /><br />And yet, season 3 has done it again...it was worth the wait, and I'm optimistic that season 3 will continue to live up to the high standards set in seasons 1 and 2.  Some new villains are introduced in episode 1, and Giancarlo Esposito is back in what seems could become a dangerous and pivotal role.<br /><br />I shut off cable a year ago, and get what TV I can for free through Hulu.  Breaking Bad is one of only two shows that I love but can't stream for free (the other being another AMC show, Mad Men).  Breaking Bad is well worth the per-episode cost.  I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|WOW!--in caps!<br />This was an excellent movie--a Martin Scorsese picture.  I call it a psychological thriller because it really messes with your head.  Through the whole movie, I didn't know what was real and what was imaginatory.  It had me hooked. I was engrossed in the story from the very beginning right through to the end, and the time passed so fast.<br /><br />Our story begins in Boston Harbor Islands, 1954.  Ted/Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a U.S. Federal Marshall traveling on a small boat with his head in the commode, barfing away from motion sickness.  (Don't worry.  You don't see anything.)  Charlie/Chuck is another Marshall traveling with him--calls Ted \\"Boss\\".  They are enroute to Shutter Island, a one-of-a kind Federal psychiatric treatment and housing facility for the severely criminally insane.  Of course, this is a high-security facility, surrounded by an electric perimeter and police or guards (not sure which, but will call them \\"guards\\" here), and is on an island with high, rocky cliffs.  The only way in or out is via ferry, and the ferry is controlled by the federal facility.<br /><br />As Teddy and Chuck's ferry docks at the Shutter Island pier, they are met by guards and transported to and inside the facility perimeter.  The outside grounds are beautiful!--pretty as an English mansion.  Some of the \\"guests\\" are manning the grounds as the guards explain to Teddy and Chuck that buildings A and B house the better adjusted guests while building C is for the most dangerous ones.  These are the incurables.  Building C is an old fort.<br /><br />We soon meet the primary doctor, played by Ben Kingsley.  He explains basically that the concept of the hospital is to provide treatment for the severely criminally insane who are beyond help at other facilities.  If the hospital cannot help the guests, they claim to at least try to provide a means of comfort for the guests to live in.  We also soon meet Max VonSydow (Needful Things, Buck Rogers, Three Days of the Condor, and many other movies) as another doctor and primary member of the hospital staff.<br /><br />Teddy and Chuck were sent to investigate the disappearance of a guest, Rachel Solondo.  Rachel drowned her three children in the lake but believes they are still alive.  She also believes the facility is actually her home in the Berkshires and the others are all attendants, so it is unlikely that she would try to leave, besides--there is no way to get out and no where to go if she did.<br /><br />Teddy also has his own demons to deal with.  He was one of the WWII soldiers who got to bust up the Krakow concentration camp at the end of the war.  Seeing the piles of dead bodies (men, women, and children) and the living victims of the camp left him with nightmares and flashbacks.  In addition, he is tormented by the memories of his pretty wife dying in a fire caused by an arsonist.  In the midst of his investigation and a raging hurricane, he becomes convinced that this facility is a house of medical experimentation in the use of psychotropic drugs, brain surgery, and barbaric torture.  Although he is told to \\"RUN,\\" he is determined to find out the truth.<br /><br />As I said before, this is a \\"WOW\\" movie.  It kept my mind completely engaged throughout the entire movie.  DiCaprio did a fantastic job in his role and you really could not second guess what would happen next.  Even though I know what happens, I would watch it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Note that I do NOT suggest this movie for your children.  ADULTS ONLY is my strong recommendation--as in age 18 or older.  I believe the concepts are too harsh for a developing mind.

The duo balance each other well, and the round performed in Crystalised is gripping.  My personal favorite track is Infinity.  Also, the XX remix of Florence + The Machine's You've Got THe Love is an outstanding track.

B00386EZJU|5.0|John Powell is without a doubt one of the most unique voices in film composition. His style is nothing but his own. I have never heard another composer come close to his sound and what he's able to do with it. John Powell also has the honor of being the best modern day composer of animated films.<br /><br />How To Train Your Dragon is Powell's first animated score since Ice Age 3, which I will admit was a disappointment even though I loved his score to Ice Age 2. How To Train Your Dragon is a much more inspired film, and John Powell brought every ounce of effort he had to the table.<br /><br />The score itself is just beautiful if you had to describe it in one word. There are two themes that Powell uses variations of. The themes themselves are 100% pure Powell. Fans of his may hear a bit of Kung Fu Panda in it with a touch of Ice Age. However, the score as an exercise in storytelling is just brilliant and one of a kind when examined that way. It will gently carry you and lift you up to a level you could never imagine. Beauty emerges from its simplicity and the emotions that grow will remind you for just a moment how unique it is to be a human being and feel these emotions. Tracks like \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" and \\"Where's Hiccup\\" will move you in a delicate fashion. Examining moments of fear with curiosity and a growing companionship, or moments of loss and hope and the ability to come back when all seems lost.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Test Drive\\", \\"Romantic Flight\\" and \\"Coming Back Around\\" soar high on human spirit and are just pure celebrations of joy and love and will likely bring you to tears. Powell does incorporate a Scottish sound for one of the themes to add flavor and atmosphere to the setting, but it never outweighs the true identity of the score. The song \\"Sticks & Stones\\" is included near the end of the album and is performed by J&oacute;nsi who is part of the Icelandic group Sigur R&oacute;s. It's a perfect closing to an amazing album.<br /><br />Full of Powell's trademark percussion and signature descending note progression this score is an absolute wonder. It reinforces just how powerful an inspired score can be and what it can do for the film. It's a beautiful celebration of the human spirit and the bond of friendship. This is a score you won't want to pass over. I always felt that Happy Feet was Powell's best score up to this point, but I do believe he has topped himself.escending note progression this score is an absolute wonder.

B000O599XK|5.0|Other than \\"How the West Was Won,\\" \\"Rio Bravo\\" is my favorite western.  It is my favorite John Wayne western (and thats saying a lot) and my favorite Howard Hawks film.  The creation of \\"Rio Bravo\\" is Hollywood legend.  Supposedly Wayne and Howard Hawks were disgusted with the film \\"High Noon.\\"  They did not like the Marshal, Gary Cooper, begging the townspeople for aid in fighting the villains on their way to town.  They also did not like Coopers throwing his badge away at the end.  They wanted a film of just the opposite with the lawman turning down assistance from well-meaning amateurs who want to aid him in keeping the villain, a rich rancher's obnoxious brother, in jail awaiting the U.S. Marshal.  (Wayne is the town sheriff, John T. Chance.)<br />Assiting Wayne are former deputy, now town-drunk \\"Dude\\" (Dean Martin,) young gunfighter \\"Colorado\\" (Ricky Nelson,) crippled deputy \\"Stumpy\\" (Walter Brennan) and a very attractive female gambler in town \\"Feathers\\" (Angie Dickinson.)  Wayne is also offered aid by a friend Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) who is soon shot in the back for his trouble.  This causes Bond's employee Colorado (Nelson) to join the team.<br />I love everything about this film: the action is great, the dialogue is terrific (I never tire of it) and the acting on every level superb.  Wayne is his usual great self as the put-upon town sheriff, Chance.  Dean Martin in one of first solo dramatic roles since his split with Jerry Lewis acquits himself nicely.  Nelson also does a nice job as Colorado.  But it is Brennan and Dickinson who really steal the picture.  Angie in her first major role really holds her own against the veterans in the cast.  Not only is she wonderful to look at but she is both funny and serious in various parts of this film.  As the potential love-interest for the Duke, while she is obviously quite a bit younger, she is still believable and terrific.  Finally there is Brennan as the deputy \\"Stumpy.\\" How this man did not win a best supporting oscar for this film I will never know.  (I don't even think he was nominated.)  He is incredibly amusing.  The villains are played by Warner Bros. contract players John Russell as the rich rancher \\"Nathan Burdette,\\" (not long afterward Russell would begin a nice run as Marshal Dan Troop in the excellent Warner Bros. western \\"Lawman,\\") and Claude Akins as his vile younger brother \\"Joe.\\"<br />A lot of people criticise a nice sing-along between Dino and Ricky Nelson in the jail as a blatant attempt by Warner Bros. to sell some records that would be released as singles.  (The Duke wisely does not join in although Walter Brennan does!)  I love this scene and never fail to enjoy it.  The great soundtrack was by the legendary film composer Dimitri Tiompkin who a year later would compose the magnificent score for Wayne's \\"The Alamo.\\"<br />This film was a great success.  Hawks liked it so much he basically remade it in 1966 as \\"El Dorado.\\"  In that Wayne played gunfigher \\"Cole Thornton\\" who is assisting the drunken sheriff played by Robert Mitchum.  They are assisted by a young James Caan in the Nelson role (now named \\"Mississippi\\") and the fantastic Arthur Hunnicutt as the ex-indian-fighting deputy \\"Bull Harris.\\"  (Hunnicutt is almost as good in this film as Brennan was in \\"Rio Bravo.\\"  They both steal every scene they are in.)  I love \\"El Dorado\\" but I love \\"Rio Bravo\\" just a little more.  Hawks went to the well one more time in 1970 with \\"Rio Lobo.\\"  However it is nowhere as good as these two.<br />Warner Bros. initially released this as a nothing DVD with no extra features.  For years I could not believe they would treat this film classic this way.  They finally woke up and rereleased it in this beautiful double-disc set with numerous special features, retrospectives and audio commentary by John Carpenter and Richard Schickel.  There are also small reprints of the original lobby card set and a small reproduction of the Dell comic book.  This great film has since beenreleased on blu-ray as well.<br />As stated, I love this film and despite its rather long length, I never tire of it.  It is a joy from start to finish.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Being a horror/suspense movie freak since I'm 5 years old (I'm 41 now), I saw every imaginable horror movie so far: from the Hammer classics to Italian gialo/gore flicks and more. Paranormal Activity is certainly among the top ten scariest movies off all time - which makes me wonder: how good are all the special effects from stupid movies like \\"the unborn\\", \\"The Eye\\"  or \\"Shutter\\" if they don't give you a single chill? On the other hand, I couldn't even sleep after watching Paranormal Activity. I guess that only \\"The exorcist\\" and \\"the Shining\\" made the same impression on me before. Actually, I'm scaried as hell right now only from thinking and writing about the film.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I would think the audience is limited for this kind of animated film but, thank goodness,I'm one of those people who loved it. \\"Fox\\" is written for other adults, let's be honest. This isn't a kids' movie because most of the dialog would go right over their heads. However, intelligent adults with a vocabulary and a quirky sense of humor should love it.  The details in the drawings also come through nicely in the Blu-Ray version.    The story is typical; father finds out family is more important than anything and young son tries to win approval from dad - but how this is executed is really \\"clever\\" to both see and hear.    If you think animated films are strictly for the young; this movie will change your mind.

1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is a novel about slavery in Louisiana in the late 18th century, the characters rich and fully drawn, particularly the lives of those who work in the kitchen for Capt. Pyke and his wife, Martha, at Tall Oaks. Like any other plantation, Tall Oaks has a hierarchy, from the big house and the kitchen servants to the field workers. Although their duties are not as physical, they are equally as tiring, perhaps more dangerous for the proximity to the Captain and his opium addicted wife. The family is shocked by the arrival of a seven-year old Irish immigrant. The Captain has purchased the red-haired Lavinia, delivering to her to the kitchen help. Unable to recall the terrors of the voyage, Lavinia is at first mute, fearful and ill, gradually nursed to health by \\"Mama\\" and the other kitchen slaves. More difficult is Lavinia's relationship with Belle, begotten of the Captain and the bane of Martha Pyke's existence. Martha believes Belle is the source of her misery, turning to opium after the loss of two babies, although she has a small daughter, Sally, and a son, Marshall. Marshall is influenced by his mother's anger towards Belle, further damaged by a relationship with the overseer, Rankin.<br /><br />Grissom relates her story through the character of Lavinia, subject to the same restrictions as the other slaves and just as vulnerable. As Lavinia gradually learns the parameters of her new life and relives the horrors of the ocean voyage, it makes no difference in her position. But this is the South and there is a difference between Lavinia and the others- the color of her skin. Lavinia is given opportunities unavailable to the others, an education in Philadelphia, marriage to Marshall Pyke. Lavinia returns to Tall Oaks with her new husband, only to learn once again the limitations of a rigid society. A violent, angry Marshall turns his rage on the helpless servants, his wife unable to intercede on their behalf. Lavinia is powerless to protect those she loves as the realities of slave life are drawn in sharp contrasts to the freedoms of the white owners.<br /><br />Grissom exposes the harsh realities of slavery  in this taut tale, exploring the relationships of those in the kitchen house and the daily dangers they endure, Lavinia accepted into the heart of a household that survives in spite of the Pyke family and their eccentricities.

B0036XN2L2|4.0|I was a fan of the Scorpions back in the 80s, in fact one of the first concerts I ever went to, was The Monsters Of Rock Tour in 1988, where they were billed 2nd to headliners Van Halen (Kingdom Come, Dokken, and Metallica before them).  I played the Hell out of their World Wide Live cassette back in those days.  I hadn't paid any attention to what they've been doing for years, until 2007, when traveling for work in Costa Rica, I saw a their video \\"Humanity\\" on the TV.  I really liked the tune, and as it turned out, soon after I met Scorpions lead singer Klaus Meine at \\"work\\" and told him how much I liked it.    So now they have released a new album titled Sting In The Tail (I see you smirking, its a 40 year joke about scorpions ok, get over it), but also announced that it, and the 3-year World Tour they are about to embark on, will be their last.  Now we all know about \\"Final\\" tours, we have been fooled so many times with that statement, and one would hope we \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" (1982 Final Tour my ass, Pete Townshend).  But, considering they offered a code for an internet presale for concert tickets with the Itunes download of the album, I figured let this be a good time to check out these mostly German (their current bassist and drummer are Polish and American, respectively) leather-clad rockers who actually pre-date the hair metal era (like Judas Priest, they've been around since the early 70s), and what kind of album they consider to be their \\"last\\".    Scorpions are:    Klaus Meine (age 61) lead singer since 1970  Matthias Jabs (age 54) guitarist since 1978  Rudolph Schenker (age 61) guitarist and founding member dating back to 1965  Pawel Maciwoda (age 43) bassist since 2003  James Kottak (age 47) drums since 1996 (also played drums in Montrose, Kingdom Come and MSG)    Sting In The Tail    Track 1:  Raised On Rock - the Scorpions \\"final\\" album kicks off with a riff so ridiculously similar to their most well known song, Rock You Like A Hurricane, that you might either chuckle or cheer.  \\"I was born in a hurricane (!!!), nothing to lose and everything to gain..\\"  The Scorpions are here, and they are here to remind you that they were raised on rock (like we had any doubts), and in verse two they are back to talkin' up the ladies and wanting to get with their lips and hips and everything else.  A catchy mid tempo rocker to start us off, with that Hurricane riff used again towards the end, just for good measure.  Thumbs up.    Track 2:  Sting In The Tail - zee title track.  This one is a little faster.  Starts off with a growly vocal line that I believe is \\"Bang bang, run with the gang\\" but honestly, reminds me a little of Burgess Meredith's \\"Penguin\\" cackle ;).  Follows a good AC/DC like groove and  \\"Yo yo, I gotta go, there's another showwww!\\" says the man.  The chorus is simply, \\"hail, hail, Sting In The Tail\\", so what that has to do with the previous line, I couldn't tell ya, but then again, we're thinking too much.  Just enjoy it in all its 3 minute and 13 second glory, with solo.  Thumbs up.    Track 3:  Slave Me - slower but heavy.  You can probably figure out the general idea of the subject matter here.  It's all about trying to find a place for one to put one's \\"stinger\\" so to speak, but not without still being in love - even it's just one night.  However, and this may where the German influence comes in, but there's a surprising refrain before the solo, about where and how hard they want it, and we're not talking with candles and rose petals.  The hardest and shortest one so far (I know there's a joke in there somewhere), clocking in at only 2:45.  Thumbs up.    Track 4:  The Good Die Young - I sense slow rocker here.  Ballad-ish, but not yet the real deal.  Acoustic intro over electric solo to start, but grows to a big sound in the choruses.  A tribute to the troops, pleading the \\"bring the boys back home again\\".  Angelic background vocals in the verses.  But again, this one rocks.  Thumbs up.    Track 5:  No Limit - back to mid tempo rock with those classic European metal riffs that immediately provoke air guitar riffing, and headbanging, or at least, bobbing.  What we're doing here, is jumping in our Maserati, setting our sights on \\"Tomorrowland\\", and livin' it up, and as we're reminded in the big chorus, there's \\"no limit\\" to the possibilities, so \\"reach for the sky\\", uh, man.  Jokes aside, nice snarly vocal and a classic metal sound.  Thumbs up for sure.    Track 6:  Rock Zone - the fastest rocker yet.  Reminiscent of AC/DC, and something that could have been on the Heavy Metal (the movie) soundtrack.  Is she from Heaven, or is she from Hell, that is the question.  \\"Bad girls keep coming / showing all the rest / what Rock n Roll girls really do best\\" - well that should help you make your decision.  Either way, \\"you're not alone in the Rock Zone\\", remember that.  This is fast, catchy, with big fat chords.  Thumbs way up.    Track 7:  Lorelei - ah yes, we have zee Ballad.  Lorelei it seems, had a hidden agenda, despite her loving persona.  But, he seems to have smartened up and moved, as in \\"Lorelei, this ship has passed you by\\".  Big emotional chorus of course.  These are the kings of the power ballad.  Thumbs up.    Track 8:  Turn You On - back to mid tempo rock.  More puns on the band name \\"do you wanna feel the sting... come and baby shake that thing\\".  The first one that seems a little too 80s, especially with the \\"come a come a come a\\"s and \\"mama mama mama\\"s.  Eh, Thumbs down.    Track 9:  Lets Rock! - slow & heavy rocker.  \\"The parties on, we're havin' a ball!\\" - indeed.  And in regards to the lady in question, he hopes she \\"has a little thing for Scorpios\\" - ok I wasn't aware that the Scorpions are all honorary Scorpios as well.  More big choruses to hook onto.  \\"We're gonna leave, a sting in your soul\\" - this is starting to sound like a concept album ;)  Thumbs up.    Track 10:  Sly - zee tear jerking ballad to end all tear jerking ballads.  The story of a rift between daughter and parents, and the silence between them is deafening.  With your standard angelic backing vocals.  It still works.  Thumbs up.  Track 11:  Spirit Of Rock - once again following the formula of mid tempo rocker after the big heavy ballad.  \\"The Spirit Of Rock will never die\\" and we're going to tell you why, all the while giving making references to the Beatles \\"She Loves You\\", especially with the \\"yeah yeah yeah\\" s at the end.  Positive vibes all around.  Thumbs up.    Track 12:  The Best Is Yet To Come - see, that's why I never believe this \\"final album\\" hype.  Always with a wink they are when they say something so final.  Unless their idea of \\"The Best\\" is growing tomatoes and playing with the grandkids, is see more music in their future.  Power Ballad which doubles as the \\"end credits\\" on this project.  Why criticize at this point?  Thumbs up.    So in all, hardly a complaint.  It's a Scorpions album.  And hopefully not the last.

B00275EGX8|3.0|The explosions are cool, the acting is horrible, the plot is bad, and it is so far off base from what EOD is, it makes Avatar(also terrible) look like an accurate representation of what is like to be a Marine or scientist. Don't go with the 25m suck radius of this film. It was cool to have a movie made with EOD as the main point though.
0786868724|4.0|I may be the only person in America who hadn't yet read Mitch Albom. If so, he has officially saturated the market as I just finished Have a Little Faith.<br /><br />Albom writes poignantly without pretentious wordiness but instead his factual sportswriter training comes through. In Have A Little Faith he writes three connected stories. One is about a rabbi, Mitch's only rabbi, who asks Mitch to write his date-to-be-determined eulogy. Mitch doesn't know \\"the Reb\\" outside of \\"the Man of God,\\" bigger-than-life, sainted rabbi of Mitch's formative years, so he begins to visit with \\"the Reb.\\" Between visits and the story of the human being he unearths, Mitch shares a winding journey of his own slip from faith and the longing he has to rediscover it. Finally, he tells the story of a reformed drug addict who preaches in a church with a funding problem as big as the hole in the roof.<br /><br />Memoirs, especially one's containing faith journeys, are showing up more and more on my to-read stack. Untainted by preconceived expectations because I hadn't read Tuesdays with Morrie, I opened Have a Little Faith with a blank check list. I found much I liked in this one. Albom's experiences with these men of faith, and those who had little faith at all, caused me to stop and consider my own faith. Why do I believe what I do? Is it tradition and connection to those who've gone before me and those who will remember me? Or is my faith based on a God whom I've seen working on my behalf? Or is my faith the result of seeing the God of miracles and marvels who inexplicably loves me though I've behaved so badly? Or maybe it's a mixture of imperfect people, a God who seems to care but feels unapproachable, and a longing that drives me to seek Him. I think it's a very good idea to occasionally check our motivations, drives and needs to see why we believe what we believe. A respectful and wistful look at faith and hope is a great place to start that inventory of beliefs, and this book delivers.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|I had the opportunity to review the tracts from this album and enjoyed it enough to buy it . I also played the tracts from \\" Lady Antebellum \\" and thought it even better that \\" Need You Now \\" . Both albums are worth your money if you like that kind of genre .
B001AQT11M|5.0|All families should create a library for their children. My pics for the Timeless 5 of Disney's Classics, (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Dumbo and Pinnochio) a must. I loved these when I was growing up in the 50's. We had LP's with the movies soundtrack. Owning something like this was just unheard of in those days, We knew the music and dialogue by heart. Then came VHS. Now we can buy or rent a copy, and build our own library My son has enjoyed them. And I know his kids will also. Digital Remastering has cleaned up the wonderful animation, making the colors vibrant again. Bringing them into the next millenium. These stories not only entertain and have a moral lesson to learn. But also teach the  importance of sharing and kindness. Good quality, hard to find in children's entertainment. Disney should always be the standard, which all family entertainment should be measured .
0385737424|5.0|This is a polished gem of a book.  Beyond the compelling story hook, the novel touches on some profound issues: how too much common sense can interfere with your ability to see a whole picture, that sense of a veil being lifted when you are able to make deep connections among things that previously seemed unconnected, the potentially huge effect on the world of even tiny actions and decisions, the new perspective you get on your own prior behavior when you reach a hand out to help someone for the first time, and the fact that you shouldn't prejudge anyone's behavior or motivations, either positively or negatively, because you may be dead wrong.  At the same time on a more prosaic level the author conveys the need for common sense in many situations, including walking the streets of Manhattan as a 12-year old, how stuck you can get when you are unable to make a decision, the sense of seeing the familiar in a different light when you start to see it through the eyes of a new observer, etc. etc.  This is a the rare \\"can't put down\\" story that can be read on so many different levels, and in this respect the only book I can think of for middle readers that is comparable to it is \\"Tuck Everlasting.\\" Congratulations, Newbery committee, on getting this one right.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|The third season is not as intense as the second, but I am looking forward to the fourth season.

0195067142|5.0|I have read a number of books on WWII, both historical and personal, and this is without a doubt my favorite of them all.  Professor Sledge conveys what it was like, fighting on the beaches and among the rocks of those terrible tropical islands, fighting against the fanatical resistence of the Japanese garrisons.  He really lets you know how horrible war is at first hand.  This is definetly one book I will never forget.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I was surprised to find that this film goes beyond animation in its design execution and even its visuals.<br /><br />We see Carl Frederickson (voice of Edward Asner) spending his life planning a great adventure. His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.<br /><br />The story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living  a lifetime together.<br /><br />There is so much depth of thought and dimension of story that you could forget it is animated.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make. Luckily, you can ignore all this extra stuff and just play the movie if you like<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00273D47O 99 Luftballons]]

B002ID08QS|5.0|I love George Benson, singing or playing. I just happened upon this and hadn't heard him lately and also saw that it was an HD disc. The sound quality is equal or superior to my Blu-Ray music discs (primarily 2L, for those familiar with classical). And his playing and singing are great, as usual. This plays a little closer to smooth jazz than bop but it's so good, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed. He and Norman Brown trade 4's on one track - wonderful.    This is a label to watch for those who like higher quality recordings.
B003102JDM|2.0|I was waiting for something to happen.  It never did.  Thought it might have some Jewish humor but I couldn't find it.  I wouldn't recommend watching this.  Only if you need a sedative to help induce sleep.  Guess it's a great movie for insomniacs.  Did have a good cast and the acting was good.  It just never takes off the ground.  Good sound track though.  As a matter of fact the sound track is the only thing in this movie that's not grounded.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I recently heard Celtic  Woman from a friends advice, I love them. I will be buying their new songs as they come out, Marvelous singers, and music.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|WOW DOES THIS CD ROCK!! UNBELIEVABLE!! THIS IS A MUST BUY!! SOUNDS LIKE IT CAME RIGHT OUT OF THE 80'S. THE BALLADS ARE AWESOME. EVERY SONG ON THE CD IS AWESOME!!!! AFTER A CD LIKE THIS PLEASE PLEASE SCORPIONS DON'T RETIRE!!!!! THIS CD IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER PUT OUT. MAN I LOVE THIS CD!! KILLER KILLER KILLER!!!!!!!! HARD TO BELIEVE KLAUS AND RUDY ARE 62 YEARS OLD AFTER HEARING THIS MASTERPIECE-THEY SOUND LIKE THEY ARE IN THEIR 20'S AGAIN. SCORPIONS HAVE PUT OUT THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD FROM ANY BAND IN A VERY LONG TIME. THIS CD DESERVES TO BE IN THE BILLBOARD TOP 10. THIS IS A NUMBER 1 ALBUM IN MY OPINION.
159102594X|4.0|I read \\"Best Served Cold\\" first and enjoyed it very much. I picked this one up to read at work while on lunch or breaks and enjoyed it just as much as \\"Best Served Cold\\" Biggest complaint is no map. I find maps help me to visualize the story and the settings the characters find themselves in. Other then that, I'd really recommend the book.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|While not my favorite 'Star Trek' series - that would be 'Deep Space 9' - I'm just commenting on the quality of the product. I purchased the complete series from Amazon.com for $176.49. (The same item lists for $400.00 on the Paramount site.) What I received was each season shrink wrapped in its own hard shell case and the entire series in a cardboard base which was in turn shrink wrapped. It looks just like the picture. After reading some of these comments I immediately opened each season to check them out. While I can't comment yet on the quality of the duplication of the entire set each disk certainly seems to be professionally manufactured. I watched the first four episodes this weekend and the quality appears to be top-notch. I don't know where these foreign-pressed sets are coming from but it doesn't seem to me that they would have come from Amazon.

B002I9Z8EO|5.0|\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", the first and most famous sequel series to the classic 1960s TV series \\"Star Trek\\", ran on TV from 1987 to 1994, accumulating a large fanbase and tremendous critical acclaim, particularly for years 3 through 6.  Following the end of the program, it moved to take the place of the TOS film series, which had wrapped up with \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" in 1991.  1994's \\"Generations\\", a passing-of-the-torch film, was a middling endeavour.  \\"First Contact\\", released in 1996, represented the highpoint of the new film series (and, of the run of the original ten films, is at least in the top two, in contention for first).  With series co-star Jonathan Frakes, the TV show's best actor-turned-director, at the helm, the production crew delivers a great sci-fi action film, one that simultaneously manages to do quite a bit with the main characters.  It has rereleased on DVD and Blu-ray following the success of Star Trek XI (or just plain \\"Star Trek\\"), and now in much more convenient packaging (and also, I note, with the numeral \\"VIII\\" added in, something that they pointedly avoided using on initial release).  Spoilers follow.    \\"Generations\\" ended with the Enterprise-D being destroyed in battle, allowing the filmmakers to introduce a new and more film-friendly ship and sets, the Enterprise-E, which is indeed a lovely looking piece of work.  There are a number of other updates here, significantly a new wardrobe for the cast that is probably the highpoint of 24th century fashion (later adopted by \\"DS9\\" for the rest of that series).  Similar to \\"The Wrath of Khan\\", \\"First Contact\\" is a sequel of sorts to an episode of the TV series, in this case \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", the season three/four two-parter that really pushed the show to superstar status.  Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Sir Patrick Stewart) has recovered from being assimilated by the cybernetic Borg, but he is still on some level traumatized by the experience, and when a new Borg invasion begins, he defies orders to take the Enterprise to the front lines - said front line being Earth, as the new Borg cube has cut through Starfleet with ease.  Picking up Worf (Michael Dorn) from the wrecked USS Defiant, they soon find themselves in the 21st century, where the Borg plan to abort first contact between Humans and alien life.  While Commander Riker (Frakes) leads a team planetside to get the spaceship ready for its rendezvous with destiny, Picard and his allies on the ship confront the Borg, who have taken root within.    The Borg are arguably Star Trek's greatest villain race (at least, they were at this point; \\"Voyager\\" would, as with many other things, drive them into the ground through overuse and villain decay), and they were probably never more effectively used than here.  Much like Starfleet, they've been redesigned to look more more sinister, with a tremendously scary new method of assimilating enemies.  The Borg Queen (Alice Krige) was a controversial element to introduce, but I think she makes sense as the synthesis of the Collective's consciousness (\\"Voyager\\", of course, would overuse her too), and the dynamics between her, Picard, and Data (Brent Spiner) are great.  Data, whose quest for emotions was played for laughs in \\"Generations\\", is treated properly here, and his scenes here really progress his character (unfortunately, the later films would abandon this without explanation, one of their bigger problems).  The epicentre of the drama is Picard, of course, and Stewart does perhaps his best work here, with Picard's quest for revenge gradually overtaking Picard's normally level-headed disposition.  Krige makes a great villain, and the two major civilian characters, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) and Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) are well-handled; Cochrane is an especially interesting and funny take on the reality behind supposedly great men.    Highly recommended.
B00005QEO2|4.0|Aerosmith has many compilations, and this is the strangest. It is one of several covering their Geffen years from 1985-1993, the band's most commercially successful era, but does not do so in the usual way. Like Big Ones, the prior collection spanning the period, it has all the hits, but this two-disc set is significantly more comprehensive. It includes a number of album tracks, many of which are at least as good as the singles, often more interesting, and certainly more diverse. There are also three tracks from Done with Mirrors, Aerosmith's first Geffen album, which is nearly always overlooked; it is widely considered one of their worst albums, or even the worst, but some will appreciate its inclusion. A few songs are also here in alternate versions previously available only as B-sides. \\"Livin' on the Edge\\" is acoustic and \\"Amazing\\" orchestral; both are interesting but inferior to the famous versions. We also get Aerosmith's historic 1986 Run-D.M.C. \\"Walk This Way\\" collaboration. In addition, there is a significant amount of songs that had been released only as B-sides or on various side projects. Some (\\"Don't Stop,\\" \\"Can't Stop Messin',\\" etc.) are throwaways, but a few (\\"Ain't Enough,\\" \\"Deuces Are Wild,\\" \\"Walk on Water\\") are excellent, including a killer cover of The Doors' \\"Love Me Two Times\\" that is far better than the original. Finally, there are four live cuts from 1998's A Little South of Sanity live album. Two - \\"Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)\\" and \\"Hole in My Soul\\" - are from 1997's Nine Lives album, thus bringing the compilation up to the first post-Geffen release. The other two (\\"Dream On\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\") are classics.    All told, it is hard to know whom this release targets. Hard-cores will be glad that some obscure tracks have wider release but will of course already have them; there is nothing actually new to attract them. Casuals will have little interest in anything but hits, making Big Ones a better buy. However, anyone wanting a morethan usually comprehensive overview of this era could do no better.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this on blue ray. Funny and family friendly movie that we used to watch on a vhs that was recorded off the t.v. Well  worth it, to have it on blue ray.
0844659770|5.0|I've been thinking and thinking about this book since I read it. To be honest, I'm at a little bit of a loss how to construct a review.<br /><br />It isn't a straightforward book, and the chronology seems to wander across the pages. By all accounts, the trial was absolutely mind-numbing, so perhaps we're getting a taste of the flow Arendt's thoughts took?<br /><br />Even before I read this, I'd read many commentary pieces about it-- some extremely critical of what they saw as Arendt's efforts to excuse Eichmann. I didn't have that experience of the work at all. Arendt makes the clear point that he was not a cartoon monster, nor a true believer. I, however, found the picture she draws of the thoughtless bureaucrat more terrifying than the worst serial killer. The thoughtless bureaucrat capable of mass murder seems to me quite a bit more common. There's also a really good point in there about needing to learn to fear precisely this sort of person. The point she makes about the Jewish leaders not recognizing the inevitable comes in part from the unwillingness to believe that something that looks so harmless (bureaucracy) can be worse than a horde at the gates. People all over are like this-- if there are *rules* it can't be that *bad.*<br /><br />Anyhow. I'm still thinking. I learned a lot from the sections on the various European countries and their responses to the Final Solution. Some of it I knew, some of it was new.<br /><br />This is, to my mind, a book that should be read. If only for the food for thought.
1416594787|5.0|For me, I would not even rate this book in terms of myself.  I'm educated and very familiar with its contents.  However, I got it for my grand-children, in case their church twists their minds against science.  It seems to good a good job in presenting the facts for corrupted minds regarding how the world developed.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Lynch is certainly in control of this film from every angle, and it is a carefully crafted noir that is haunting, hypnotic, and wildly inventive. I understand that is about Diane's dream and its fractured nightmare logic, but it seems to be more about pure mood than anything else. Lynch is certainly a master of evoking a sense of paranoia and fear, but the film, like many of his others, left me thinking, so what? I've seen it three times through and there are certainly clues to its oneiric logic, and it doesn't really \\"cheat\\" the viewer with contrived twists out of left field (not a shaggy dog story). But, that being said, it comes off as more of an expert exercise than an unforgettable experience. Again, the exercise is handled skillfully, but ask yourself, so what? Is it another example of excessive style over substance? Do we ever really care about these characters? And if some of us eventually do, does it not come long after having to rummage through all of Lynch's tedious individual scenes, some with characters and narrative threads that never go anywhere? There are other stylistic exercises full of nightmare logic, like Scorsese's \\"After Hours,\\" that work wonderfully; something about \\"Mulholland Drive\\" just keeps me from jumping on the bandwagon. I sometimes think Lynch's film are dark in-jokes told for exclusive kicks, irrespective of the audience. There is a gentleman on youtube who I've heard explain otherwise impenetrable films like \\"Lost Highway\\" with recondite discussion that seems both post-modern and quasi-spiritual. If what he expounds is truly Lynch's philosophy, than I fear only Lynch and coffee shop regulars interested in esoteric academia will ever know what exactly is going on in some of these films. Don't get me wrong, I find 'Mulholland Drive\\" much more fascinating than both \\"Lost Highway\\" and, I'm sorry to report, \\"Blue Velvet.\\" The former seems incomprehensible, and the latter needs to decide what kind of movie it wants to be (I may be one ofthe few who agree with Ebert on Velvet, even though I disagree with him on Mulholland). Sometimes I feel that directors jettison those parts of a movie that are most taken for granted--like story, plot, etc.--for the sake of experiment (not always a bad thing), occasionally making a movie entirely inaccessible to an audience. Obviously, by the explications provided here, there is an audience adept at \\"reading into\\" Lynch's work. I'm glad. Maybe they will have to let me in on the Lynchian mystery.
1592332803|4.0|This book is a must-have for people who are vegan but don't want to give up sweets.  Truthfully, giving up meat is way easier.  I definitely recommend this book of baked good recipes for everyone who wants to stay healthy AND eats sweets.
B0007R4TAS|4.0|the suffering caused by a time when religion dictated no divorce for any cause, when there existed no psychotropic medication to aleviate maddness and people were simply locked up in back rooms (remember \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\"?) , when the humiliation of being a mistress, instead of a wife, when illigitmate children were \\"bastards\\" and  scorned at best?  Only viewers who understand that world can also understand the suffocating \\"smallness\\" of at religious society which makes the story of Jane Eyre so near a tragedy.     ( Although to enjoy the the story with a cast and director who seem to understand the tragedy and ultimate triumph of Rochester and Jane Eyre I recommend this version with George C Scott etc in VCR form since the DVD is cut so drastically that even with having read the book, the movie is hard to follow.)      Other more recent DVD versions treat this story like nothing more than a paperback  romance, a \\"bodice ripper\\"  with pretty men meant only to sexually tittilate with their in your face over acting.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I was in no hurry to see this, just because of all the hype. I needn't have worried. It was absolutely enjoyable. There was just the right balance of drama and humor; it was compassionate but not at all maudlin. Several treasured Hollywood-PC stereotypes got kicked to the curb, and \\"family values\\" got respect, rather than mockery. How did this movie get made, let alone released to the attention of America? Bring us more, and maybe we will go back to the theater, again.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I hardly everwrite a review but this book was so good that I had to share my opinion.  This book was one of the most engaiging and exciting books I have read.  rich character development combined with a thrilling and unpredictable plot made his a cznt put it down til Im finished read.  Lizbeth Salander is totaly fascinating
0307463745|5.0|If you're used to other business books spending lots of time and pages to make a point, this book will seem a bit sparse at first...    In this case, less is definitely more-- they get straight to the point as they cover all the topics that they've run into while building their business at 37signals.       Definitely worth a read, especially if you've flirted with the idea of starting your own business.

1594488843|5.0|Drive:The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Dan Pink offers the reader a new theory of motivation--one that resonates with today's reality. Why is Google so innovative, and how do they attract the best and brightest to work there? How did 3M come up with those sticky notes that I use all the time? And why is Best Buy thriving while Circuit City, formerly a Good to Great darling,now in chapter 11? Look closely at today's most productive organizations (Google, Best Buy, Amazon), and you'll see a new \\"operating system\\" working--often humming behind the scenes--especially when you look at organizations populated with engaged, happy, and productive people. Pink calls that new operating system Motivation 3.0--based on intrinsic drivers, not carrots and sticks (of an older, more linear, manufacturing-like Motivational 2.0 system). Specifically, Pink's model, Motivation 3.0, depends on three constructs (like a three-legged stool): Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose, which I'd call A-M-P--as in: \\"I'm all amped up!\\"
1569242739|5.0|I love this book! This was given to me by a friend and is one of the best gifts I have ever received. I regularly bake vegan (I'm allergic to dairy and eggs), so I'm used to doing lots of substitutions. VCTOtW, however, already incorporates these into the recipes, making vegan baking as simple as following a recipe for those with varying degrees of experience. The cakes are delicious, and so are the frostings. There is a ton of variety within the book (from basic to gourmet) and lots of ways to customize your cupcakes. If I had a complaint, it would be that I always get WAYYYY too much frosting when I follow the recipe. I don't know if they mention this in the book, but from now on I'll be cutting my icing recipes in half since I always have some left over. I'm sure this isn't a problem for everyone, I just hate to throw it away since I don't think the shortening in the frosting will keep for very long.  This book is awesome--for vegans and non-vegans. Delicious, and definitely worth buying!!!

B002K0WBXW|3.0|Why is it that Hollywood cannot make a good movie?  This movie follows a pattern that seems to plaque Hollywood--some great jokes and funny scenes in the first half and then a rapid decline into cliche, formula,  and manipulation in the second half.  Every time you see the marginal notes of the script on the screen you are painfully aware of the incompetence of the writers and director.  In case you do not know what I mean concerning marginal notes, watch the scene when Bullock gets in the boat and starts driving at full speed--the notes in the margins of the script will dictate that \\"at this moment, Margaret takes control of the situation and reverts to her masculine side, compensating for the emotional (feminine) connection she just felt discussing family with Gramma. This scene needs to move the movie forward by making her vulnerable, especially after she falls into the water and faces her worst fear--not being able to swim (which we made sure to have her mention in the earlier scene).  Let's make sure that she is rescued by the male and then comforted by his strong embrace.  We must make the audience connect to her during this scene, otherwise the rest of the hastily constructed movie won't work!!\\"    I do not understand why Hollywood needs to emphasize these elements so strongly that it interferes with the viewing of the movie.  As long as Hollywood is crafting jokes the comedies work, but they cannot stop themselves from inserting a strong moral into the movie and this is always the movie's Achilles' heel.  Just watch the first half and you can anticipate how it will end.  So many bad scenes/lines in the second half I wanted go watch a Shirley Temple movie for something good.
0061914177|4.0|He did Crush It in this book. Its almost auto-biographical in a sense, but through his story and examples, you can better understand the entrepreneurial spirit that exists in everyone. Gary just shows you how to light a fire and crush it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have been aware of Food, Inc. for some time, but watching it kept getting lost in the shuffle.  Now that I've finally watched it, I'm sorry that I let it get lost in the shuffle for so long.  Saying that it is one of the most important films you'll ever watch seems rather bombastic, but I'm serious about that claim.  I had already begun to change my buying habits at the grocery store and to begin to consider what I am putting my body and the bodies of my children, and this film made me more convinced than ever that this is not only the right thing to do, but also the only responsible thing to do.    What was really telling for me was how the major corporations that were examined (Tyson's, Monsanto, etc.) refused to comment on the film.  When we walk into a U.S. grocery store, we have certain expectations about the quality of our foods.  When a film like this starts to poke holes into those illusions, and the major corporations concerned with these products refuse to comment, what should we, as consumers, think of their lack of response?  The current climate in the U.S. has shown us what happens when capitalism is allowed to run amok, when the dollar becomes more important than the person who is holding it.  It's not overstating things to say that what's going on in the food industry right now is every bit as alarming as what was going on in our financial institutions.    I think what this film best illustrates is how our politicians (on both sides of the aisle), our government, and the heads of the departments we've entrusted to ensure our safety (USDA, FDA, et al.) have routinely sold us out for the sake of the almighty dollar.  The production of food has become so industrialized in this nation that the focus has shifted from ensuring safety to turning a blind eye in order to ensure the continued padding of the bottom line.  If Upton Sinclair could see what's going on today, he would despair over how we've learned nothing from his groundbreaking work, \\"The Jungle\\".    My one issue with this film is its delicate handling of the new organic food industry.  I have switched to buying mostly organic foods, but I often wonder if this really is the solution to the problem, as it claims to be.  As these large organic companies (Stonyfield Farm, anyone?) start to grow to conglomerate status, do we run the risk of finding ourselves right back at square one?  I think the producers should have considered taking a harder look at these companies as well.    Still, this is a film that is essential.  If Americans do not stand up and demand to know where their food comes from, demand to know why current practices are accepted, we all run the risk of a public health disaster.  This may sound dramatic, but one need only look at the rampant e. coli outbreaks to see that the proof is literally in the pudding.  We have grown far, far too complacent about the things we put into our mouths, trusting to regulatory agencies that are no longer operating under the mandate of ensuring public safety.      The best lesson anyone can take from this film is that each and every one of us has the power.  Yes, these are huge corporations that command legions of lawyers and billions of dollars in profits, but where do those profits come from?  If we vote with our wallets, if we refuse to accept the presence of cloned meat and bio-engineered corn products in our foods, these companies will have no choice but to stand up and take notice.  We all need to go to the grocery store, pick up a container, read the ingredients, and walk away from anything that has unnatural ingredients in it. In this way, we can all become agents for the changes we want to see effected.

B00328G4V6|4.0|This is a pretty good album.  I was especially interested because most of the album is done by the orginal Experience band.  The sound is clean.  The band is usually tight.  I particularly like Lover Man and Sunshine of your love.
0307394549|5.0|I'm an avid baker, and I have lots cookbooks with lots of cookie recipes.  This collection from Martha Stewart has become my first stop when I'm looking for a recipe though because it gives you lots of different types of cookies, using lots of different types of ingredients, and it includes unique variations on some classics.  The book is organized by the texture/type of cookie--soft cookies, crunchy cookies, thin cookies, etc. which makes it easy to know what your cookie is going to come out like in the end.  The thorough index in the book make it easy to figure out which cookies use which ingredients, so when for example, you have a bunch of ripe bananas that you need to use, it's easy to quickly locate all of the cookies that use bananas.<br /><br />Every recipe I've tried from this book has been stellar.  They're easy to follow and they've all turned out great.  Martha even offers some instructions on how to decorate, along with how to package cookies for gift giving and some tips on tools and ingredients.  This is a great book for a serious cookie baker--it will become her go to resource for delicious cookies every time!
0061703257|5.0|I was immediately sucked into this incredibly written, highly suspenseful psychological mystery.  I knew instantly that there was something sinister afoot, but it revealed itself very slowly, until the final pages delivered a dynamic conclusion.  While I'm not typically a fan of dream sequences, the scenes illustrating Teddy's nightmares were haunting and full of significant imagery.  The tension was palpable and I devoured this book with a sense of anxiety that I rarely experience while reading.  I could easily elaborate more on the foreboding atmosphere, the well written characters and the extreme sense of paranoia infused throughout the novel, but I'd rather just encourage readers to discover it for themselves.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This movie is definitely worth seeing! It was really amazing. The story begins with Gandhi being assassinated and then flashes back to a run in he had on a train while he was seated in first class. From there, Gandhi begins his journey of showing the world that we are all children of God, not only certain people. You see his transformation from a young brilliant lawyer to a man of few possessions and many followers. It was truly amazing to see and hear what Gandhi had to say to people in high government positions and those who were in severe poverty. His outlook on life is one that I wish we could duplicate and give out like a drug. His passion for all men, women and children and for non violence is something that I will remember for a lifetime.  This movie is one that should be shown to every person in the world. It relates to world religions in many ways. First, it is a teaching that we should all, no matter what religion we are, should follow. One of his quotes, \\"I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you\\" ([...])is a powerful statement and shows how passionate he was about all people. If everyone thought like Gandhi and truly believed in the above quote, this world would be a much more peaceful place for all of us to live. Another way it relates to world religions is that it teaches acceptance and understanding of all religions. Gandhi is a Hindu, but has a love and understanding of all religions. He believed that we are all children of God and that we should all be treated fairly and that no religions is lower to any religion.    I truly believe that this movie should be shown to each person living on this planet at least once, if not once a year. It is an astounding look at the human being we all have inside of us and the fact that one person can, and does, make a difference.
0312330537|5.0|I loved this novel. I had trouble putting it down once I started it. I loved the author's writing style and the beautiful way he put together his thoughts.  His words were delightful. The story was so engaging and brings to light a whole world of the Mumbai slums...I read this before slum dog millionaire came out and I think this would even be a better visual. This author did convey a visual experience to me. I read it twice and will keep the book around to read again.      I wouldn't put this writer in the league of Faulkner but I would say he is one of the better contemporary writers.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|While I've seen only 2 in the series, the Discovery broadcast version is inferior to the Attenborough bluray from at least 3 points:<br /><br />Winfrey's presentation is contrived and pretentious; she tries to sound like a naturalist, but it pales to the more sincere presentation of a real naturalist like Attenborough.  The scripts contain the same basic content, but the words used seem geared towards high school level comprehension<br /><br />The music is not identical, its timing and orchestral quality varies from the Attenborough version, so the scenes do not have the same buildup or dramatic impact<br /><br />The Discovery version scenes are shorter, which worsens the impact as with the music<br /><br />Life seems like a re-edit of a lot of unused footage used to make many prior BBC nature productions [[ASIN:B001957A44 The BBC Natural History Collection featuring Planet Earth (Planet Earth/ The Blue Planet: Seas of Life Special Edition/ Life of Mammals/ Life of Birds)]].  If you've seen one of these linked videos, Life takes off from where much of the footage in these prior versions end.  However, it only seems like a continuation if you watch the BBC/Attenborough version.<br /><br />Overall, the Discovery version seems more commercial than a more artistic approach taken by the BBC/Attenborough team.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love Supernatural. The third season of supernatural is as Epic as the first and seconds but the focus narrows, which is what happens as the boys learn to specialize in demon hunting! I love this series, I own all the other seasons available and am saddened that the fifth season is the last. The extras in the collection are great and fun!
B000002MU3|5.0|For some perspective my favorite REMs are Monster(94)-Murmur(83)-Document(87)...This review is simple- ALL the things that make/made REM a powerhouse are here and then some. The catchy yet atmospheric sounds,the jangly intricate music/vocals&harmonies- its all here just mixed in with some thicker guitars & louder drums for a wallish kind of sound (Ronettes&Slowdive had that wall of sound-does that make them too heavy or grunge(?) u cryin babies.) People be acting scared like this is heavy and loud like Testament or Madball WTF.      To me its mindboggling how supposed \\"hardcore REM fans\\" talk down on this all the way. I can understand if these \\"fans\\" don't dig every song on this record but with songs like \\"I don't sleep I dream\\",\\"Strange Currencies\\",\\"BangBlame\\",\\"Let me in\\",\\"You\\"- these softies are as beautiful and haunting as anything they've done before if not more.And its not like the harder songs lose REM's trademarks. Monster is everything REM ever was up to this point but with more ideas & sounds. Dosen't nessecarily make it better for those reasons but I hear this record beginning to end and enjoy the ride. If Sabbath,Stooges,Jane's Addiction, shoegazer style sounds aren't too heavy for you to handle and you already like/love REM then Monster should entertain and move you.

1594488843|5.0|It has some interesting points and good arguments for how humans are motivated and how the workplace is changing, or a change is necessary because of the new generation's perceptions, habits and demands. I think anyone who wants to understand how to successfully lead their employees, team, etc. as well as anyone who wants to understand more about themselves and how they can be happier and better at what they do in general should read this.
0312370830|4.0|Sarah's Key was in my pile of books to read during my school break.  What a treasure to read this book.  It is a book that lingers in your mind long after you close the book. I had to find every article and Youtube that the author did, so I could get inside her mind to understand the book at a even deeper level.      I too was one reader who was not familiar with the July, 1942 round-up of Jews in France by the French police.  It was heart-breaking reading the angst and pain that Sarah endured when she realized what she had done to her little brother.  The weaving of the two women's stories (Julia and Sarah) was effective tool that helped the reader compare and contrast the lives of rich characters with very different personal struggles in two different time eras.     Albeit, Sarah's struggles were much more drastic and dramatic, nonetheless, the modern woman could relate to Julia's dead marriage and could only imagine the depth of despair of Sarah.  Sometimes, Julia's story seemed contrived but, given the horrific events of Sarah's life, I am not sure the author could have written Julia's story in a more compelling manner.  Read this book for a deep emotional understanding of another horrific event of the Holocaust and for joy of peering into other's lives
B00003CXBH|5.0|This epic film on Blue Ray rocks on the rocks with the ROCK! With all the trash and garbage on BD how about watching one of the best films ever made that is a true story! Real life is stranger and more exciting than any science fiction you will ever watch. Struggle between absolute good and absolute evil. This mission was the real deal folks!<br /><br />This film reminds me of a priest that I knew first hand in Guam during the Vietnam war. He was tortured for years in a prison camp during WWII. They told him to deny Christ and the torture would stop. He looked at me and said, \\"I just couldn't do that\\".<br />I was a Baptist but now just a Christian. Drop the labels folks!<br /><br />Thanks for the BD version! Very nice gift for every Christmas.
0312370849|5.0|This work of fiction, is actually two stories, one set in modern times and one from true events that took place in Paris under the Nazi regime of World War II.    It is extraordinarily well written, a real page turner - but it will break your heart when you learn the truth about what happened to thousands of French children.    Please read this book, you will be very glad you did. And add to your knowledge of \\"NEVER AGAIN!\\"
B0007KS7D0|2.0|I bought this after reading an article in Popular Photography. The article said it was a good, cheap alternative to buying a macro lens. It also showed a sample photo taken with the product, and the quality was quite good. However, the product did not work well with my lens, the Tamron 18-250mm. The vignetting was so severe the image was just a circle in the center of a dark frame. The quality of the image in that circle was not bad, and with certain lenses the product might be worth the money. I would recommend researching what lenses it works well with before buying it. I also think it makes the most sense to use extension tubes for macro work. They don't add any glass in addition to your lens. The only reason I didn't use extension tubes is that they are not made for my camera.
B000002L7G|5.0|one of my favorites. mark knopfler and dire straits are great. my favorite song has to be walk of life. i especially like the video with the sports bloopers in it. i have brothers in arms on cassette, but not on cd until now. the product arrived on time, in the condition they promised and i am very satisfied with the service. amazon.com is the best. thanks.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I was a tad skeptical that a $9ish HDMI cable would work. I could not have been more wrong. This cable works flawlessly and I plan on ordering more! I thought about some of the cheaper cables, however I went with the cables sold BY Amazon.com so I would have the comfort of knowing I had a reliable seller with a easy return policy.     If you are on the fence about these cables, like I was, take the leap and buy one today!
B00332GA8I|5.0|This is a 'State of the Art' way to present media that everyone is seeking! Please put all my movies on flash drives! That way I always have my movie with me and it is easier to put on my TV, since it is already hooked up to do so, I can happily eliminate my DVD player and all the disc's that way! Michael Jackson would be proud to have his 'state of the art' work on the 'state of the art' venue! The movie was great anyway, but FANTASTIC idea, I want more!!!

B000IOEQ1M|4.0|Just picked this up for 2 Singapore Dollars (1.50$ USD) without knowing the author, but I have to say once I started, I found myself committed to finishing. Instead of a clear seamless front-to-back flow to the story, we effectively had 5-6 set pieces hung together by bare threads of plot.  What that focus did was to allow me to enjoy each of the short set-pieces without getting hung up on the overall arcs. That was refreshing and fit my attention span/schedule well. All in all - it was a good read and I will be picking up Kilo next.
0761119752|5.0|We love all of Sandra Boynton's books in our house, and this is no exception. We like to make this one into a bedtime song. It's an excellent story and a durable book for little ones. I definitely recommend it!

B0021L8UPS|5.0|First off, whoever gave this 4 stars and under sucks anyway. The last time I saw a movie this good through it's entirety probably was The Mist maybe. Let me explain to you how a movie is good or not. a movie has to have some type of drive and character to it where you can get your mind to stay focused and really care about the dialouge and the actors and etc...if the films boring or drags you find yourself losing interest in the characters, the script etc...then when someone ask you how was the film?? You say \\"ahh it was alright, or terrible, or whatever\\" becuase the movie gave you nothing to feed off of you lost focus. Orphan doesn't do that. This movie was unpredictable, Isabelle Fuhrman acting was superb to the fullest. She did a excellent job. This whole movie was just refreshing seeing so many bad movies and remakes come out lately. I actually had my eyes glued to the screen for once the entire time, and the ending just made my day. Every so often a movie comes out like this and I can't wait to own the Dvd and this was one. I think I've watched the Orphan over 50 times. I hope they never make a remake. If you don't own this get it. I'm a movie critic, and I've seen 100's of movies old and new, so it takes a lot to really make me watch it more then once, or reccomend it to someone else......but that's just my opinion...I'd give it 10 stars if they had 10 stars to give
0064430227|5.0|I was so eager to buy this for my daughter that I probably bought it a little too early. At 18 months, she was totally uninterested, but it wasn't long before she learned to love the story of Harold and his magical purple crayon. Who wouldn't love this story??
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The movie was nominated for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards.  I now know why.  Very good film.  Very informative.  Sure makes you  want to grow your own food!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|FANTASY, Fictional. I love it! My only caution is that I wouldn't want weak persons to watch it that may be influenced by the teachings in the movie. Each person has their own strength, not given by the creater or the keeper. Rubbish. The keeper wants to destroy the world because the world is evil and wants to destroy this evil. Ha! But it works for me if you pretend you're living in the Old Testament times. The movie is for purely entertainment purposes only. I'm a Netflix member and I must confess to the Confessor - \\"I've watched each episode as soon as possible, the only distraction was much needed sleep after watching continuously for 36 hrs. Upon awakening and attending to the most mandatory obligations, I again watched uninteruptedly. And, I must confess again, if anyone was to get in my way, I would have killed without magic or potions. May the Light protect me from the underworld.
0446364495|4.0|Just a few weeks ago, I spent some profitable time viewing Clint Eastwood's film version of The Bridges of Madison County. I've since written a Film Review for Amazon. It then seemed logical to read the book - which I've now done twice - and make a few remarks about it.<br /><br />I quite like Mr Waller's book. I like its simplicity, the lack of clutter, and the conscious choice to impress the reader with a shorter story well told. It would have been OK to have added characters and tangential story-lines, fleshed out the detail, and told us more of Iowa and covered bridges and Summer vegetables. And too, I would have been pleased with more description regarding disparate mind-sets and life experience and local color. Mr Waller didn't seem to want to do all that. TBoMC is what it is.<br /><br />One might suggest that denser material such as that of Tom Clancy and Stephen King is quality work within their respective genres, and that person would be correct. But then, so is just about any volume in the `Nancy Drew' series. And is anything more profound than Dr Seuss's The Butter Battle Book?<br /><br />I've come to appreciate such simplicity in my middling years. I don't believe this `thinness' to which some take exception of necessity diminishes the quality of the writing or the satisfaction to be gained by its reading. Neither should it minimize the stature of the author.<br /><br />If I had been editor, I might have advised Mr Waller to publish without the chapters: `The Beginning,' the `Postscript,' or the `Interview with \\"Nighthawk\\" Cummings.' These are not necessary, are actually somewhat distracting, and don't quite measure up in quality to the core of the book. Bets are even they were actually added last. TBoMC would have been a wonderful novella without those pages.<br /><br />Ehhh, but it's all just my opinion anyway.<br /><br />Four Stars is entirely appropriate though. This is a fine piece of writing and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Russell de Ville<br />27 March 2010
0689825498|5.0|At first, I didn't really love this book. I'd read in an article in a parenting magazine  that this was a \\"must have\\" book, so I ordered it from Amazon.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie while whatching cable about 3 am a few years ago. I've loved it every since. A wonderfully told story with lots of well known and little known actors and actresses. Personally I think that Steve Buscemi's small parts make this movie over the top funny. Danny Devito, Jessica Lang. So many actors in this flick.     This is a story of a man's tall tales coming to life as his son is telling them to his fiance. This film is funny, touching, and has lessons learned as well. Of course I own it and I highly recommend it.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|This album does not disappoint. I have been an obsessed Him fan since 2002 and these guys continue to impress me. I do admit,it is a new sound,but I LOVE IT!!!
0312945973|3.0|Just know that I really enjoyed reading this book.  My crique's tend to point out a book's weaknesses.  Hopefully, I succeed in setting your expectations so that you can enjoy this book as well; maybe even be pleasantly surprised.    1st.  Calling all librarians!  Please shelve this book with other adventure novels, not in historical fiction.  I don't know much about Egyptian history, but my gut tells me neither does Wilbur.  If you are looking for historical fiction about an ancient civilization, I recommend Aztec over this one.  Aztec has it's issues, but at least I came away from the novel feeling that I had gained a true understanding of the people, their culture, and way of life.  With River God, I was hoping for the same.  And, I got some.  But in the end, I don't \\"know\\" the egyptians like I do the aztecs.      The character developement is good, but the action and pacing is close to perfect in my opinion.  A couple hundred pages could have been trimmed.  I guess what keeps me from singing high praise of this book is that I much preferred the first Wilbur Smith novel I read -- Birds of Prey.  I'm not a pirate book kind of guy.  And would much prefer to read about egyptians.  But Birds of Prey was a superior story in every way.  Better character development.  Better scenery.  Better action sequences.  More adventure.  Maybe less politics, but that would be it.    So, had I not read Jennings' \\"Aztec\\" or Smith's \\"Birds of Prey\\", the tone of this critique would accentuate my praise for the novel.  Which I did enjoy.  Very much.  If you haven't read either of these, read River God, you'll love it!!!
0689835604|3.0|I read an article in a parenting magazine which suggested several \\"must have\\" books for babies/young children. This was on the list, so I ordered it from Amazon. I have to admit that I was personally disappointed. I find the story overly simplistic, even for a young child. The flaps aren't very sturdy, as it usually is with any book flaps. My daughters enjoyed the book well enough when they were very small, but it really isn't meant for children older than maybe one year or so.

I used to watch the cartoon after school when i was in high school and my mom babysat a bunch of kids. i never read any of the comic books (i know, bad for me) but i loved the cartoon enough to be excited when they anounced a live action movie.<br /><br />I have heard from MANY friends that the movie doesn't hold up to the history of the franchise, but i still love it, and the three that followed.<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE

B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie has it all.  Forrest Gump goes through the most important events from the 70's, 80's, 90's.  The story is just amazing.  This is my favorite movie and will continue to be unless they make a Forrest Gump 2, which I think they should do.  They have little Forrest go off on the bus and I think that is where Forrest Gump 2 should start out.  I would make the 2nd movie somewhat similar but make it from the events from the 90's, 00's, and now 10's.  They should have begun making this movie by now but I guess they just want to leave Forrest Gump rest as one of the best movies of all times.

The traditional Dr. Seuss illustrations bring me back to my own childhood, and I'm happy my girls will share some of those same  memories. It's also a nice introduction into rhyming and onomatopoeia.

1932907009|2.0|Read Kingseyeland's review for an accurate review of this book. I also flicked through the book at a bookstore. Let me say the title is very misleading. Aside from tips about how to sum up a film in a sentence (the log-line), the book didn't offer much. I also thought Snyder stuck the boot into the film Memento unfairly. Momento is mentioned in various film study books due to its creative editing and manipulation of narrative structure. Snyder's barbs just sounded bitter. Really, Snyder wrote (and freely admits to writing) \\"Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot\\". Is that the voice of wisdom? Log-line for this book: Old hack writer name drops incessantly and attacks independent films whilst offering little to no original information himself. Do yourself a favour and go and purchase a better book on this subject.
B002VECM72|3.0|Good movie, but it is a real shame that it was not shot in a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1 or 2.40:1.  The aspect ratio this film is shot in (1.85:1) is now the standard for TV shows.  In my opinion, all theatrically released movies should now be shot in either 2.35:1 or 2.40:1.

0143116177|4.0|Controversial counterfactual historian Niall Fergusson here turns his considerable talent for lucid explanation of complex historical developments to the evolution of credit and debt and the growth of what we call `money' in all its forms. In six clear chapters, he does a mainly excellent job of laying out the evolution of ever more complex economic systems through the three thousand years since the ancient Mesopotamians used clay tablets to record debt and credit over decades of commodity transactions, to the hedge funds and derivatives which have featured so prominently in the recent global financial crisis.<br /><br />On the way he explains the origin of the modern banking system in the `ghettos' of Venice in the 1300s, the adoption and later the abandonment of silver and gold to underpin national currencies, the first truly global currency (the Spanish `piece of eight'), the origin of the first stock exchange (in Amsterdam) in the 1600s, the innovation of scientifically calculated actuarial insurance tables by the Scottish Widows insurance company in the 1700s and the modern obsession with property as a store of wealth and as collateral for credit loans. He discusses the concept of the welfare state, the government bond market and the reasons for occasional total financial collapses, as in Germany in the 1920s and Argentina several times in the past 150 years most recently in 1989.<br /><br />The causes of booms and busts, bubbles and crashes are analysed with knowledge and insight. The author demonstrates in his best-seller `Empire' and more thoroughly here his thesis that poverty in the `developing world' is caused by the absence of stable financial institutions because such jurisdictions are outside the global economic system rather than the more naïve and simplistic narrative of `exploitation' by international institutions (business, the world bank etc.). At a more local level the same principles operate with the same results: loan sharking grows where there is lack of access to normal credit and this is the main cause for the perpetuation of the poverty trap.<br /><br />A final chapter deals with the rise of `the wonderful dual country of Chimerica' the interdependent symbiotic relationship between the USA and China which accounts for one tenth of the world's land surface, a quarter of its population, one third of all global economic output and half of all economic growth over the past ten years. He explores how this important relationship is coming to dominate the global economy.<br /><br />Ferguson is a champion of the globalization of capital markets and makes a strong case for the liberal economics of Milton Friedman. He has a habit of distilling down complex and bewildering subjects to their basic elements and explaining the underlying processes clearly and with great insight. Recommended reading for anyone who wants a more than basic introduction to the history of the global economy and how it works but does not have the time nor inclination to do all the reading necessary for a degree in economics and finance. He knows his stuff, and is a lively and interesting writer.ess to normal credit and this is the main cause for the perpetuation of the poverty trap.

Not only did I enjoy the story, I appreciated learning more about the culture in Malawi, for example their belief in magic, unusual food choices, family relationships, etc.  I also enjoyed hearing about the people who helped William receive the recognition he deserved and achieve his goals. Great book!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|this was quite possibly the worst movie ever...I found no redeeming quality to it..from the gratuitous violence to the idiocy of Brad Pitts accent.  If you want to waste money then by all means buy it ....the rest of the viewing world won't miss you from it ranks.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I just finished watching my Lots DVD.  Started getting hooked watching season 2 on TV, so I had a lot of catching up to do.  I absolutely love this show.  Started out not so hot with the first 2 episodes, but boy did it take off after that.  The storylines are great and well acted.  Never heard of most of the cast before, but they click together and are believable.  One of my favorites in season 2 is Richards Mord sith bodyguard, Cara.    Can't wait for season 2 to come out, be buying that as well, so I can get my fill anytime I want.    T
0061767581|1.0|I love the hills. and I admire Lauren on the show, so that's why I wanted to read her book. When I got it, I thought it was going to have the same drama, that love- tranglie, friendship feeling you see on the show, but it wasn't! When I read the first 10 pages, it lacked a story, the whole story was run-on, there was no \\"drama\\" in the book.  There was so much profanity in the book, the whole story fell apart. It lacked creavity, and reading that book was like reading a bad movie you don't like. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE AUTHERS NAME, THIS BOOK IS TRASH AND NOT WORTH READING!
0060558121|5.0|In a previous review I said that Neil Gaiman's writing style reminded me a lot of Douglas Adams and now I wonder if I was more correct than I originally thought. American Gods is a story about the Gods and mythical characters of various pantheons and folklores living in America, mere shadows of their former selves. Taking on the roll of semi leader is Odin himself who now eeks out a living as a con artist. `In Life, the Universe and Everything' Douglas Adams had Arthur Dent meet the actual Norse god Thor at a party and in one of his final books, `The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul' Adams explored the idea of Norse gods living in Britain in a greatly weakened state. Odin, in particular, had descended into a condition where he lived only for the luxury of a nice hospital bed and an attending nurse. So is it just a coincidence that Douglas Adams and Neil Gaiman wrote about nearly the exact same topic? There is also a tie-in with Gaiman's later book, The Anansi Boys, as Anansi the Spider is featured in this book as an aging black man with yellow gloves and wonderful stories. Regardless of whether this is an homage to Adams or merely some cosmic coincidence this is an absolutely fantastic book. You could also argue that American Gods is a continuation of the theme established in the 1984 film The Neverending Story where the power and ultimately existence of fantasy creatures are dependent on peoples beliefs or lack thereof.<br /><br />Between Douglas Adams and Neil Gaiman, Adams had a much keener wit but Gaiman is a better storyteller, in fact he is one of the best storytellers I have ever read. Gaiman's first novel, Stardust, was a good but flawed effort but the other two I've read including American Gods' have been spectacular. Gaiman is one of those writers who makes it look effortless with a light breezy style. He manages to bring the reader into his world which is always just slightly askew from our own.<br /><br />My biggest and perhaps only issue with the book is that it reads like the directors cut of a film with all the deleted scenes left in. At just shy of 600 pages I would say that trimming the book down to a leaner 400 or so pages would have tightened up the story significantly. There are even a few side stories completely separate from the main one that, although well written, could be jettisoned with no loss to main plot. If you just can't get enough of Gaiman's writing you may want every sentence retained but personally I found these occasional diversions unnecessary and even the main plot felt like it could have used some tightening. Still, I never found it ponderous despite its length.<br /><br />I read this entire book during a two week trip to Asia saving at least a quarter of the book for the flight home and it definitely made the journey easier. This one is a page turner and I was more than pleased with the ending. From my experience endings are the hardest thing for a writer to pull off and after nearly 600 pages Gaiman had damn well better deliver. Although I'm giving Gaiman top marks its unlikely I will read it through a second time. It has neither the brevity of a Douglas Adams book or the grandeur of a series like Lord of the Rings but with some serious trimming might make an excellent film.that it reads like the directors cut of a film with all the deleted scenes left in.

Jack's solid assumptions about human nature are mixed in with wild guesses out of the blue.  NYC is the city that never sleeps, except when it does.  The Patriot Act has turned the USA into an oppresive police state, and yet nobody seems to have throught to install security camerss anywhere.    Jethro Gibbs at NCIS could have wrapped this one up in an hour, with time out for commercials; Lee Child pads the word count out to a [...] buck paperback.

B001OQCV2O|1.0|This movie was ridiculous!  I really expected a more serious approach to the fear of the day of apocalypse recognized by the Mayan calendar of Dec 21st, 2012.  The story was extremely weak and yet they felt that they had to stretch it for more than 2 and a half hours.  What you would usually think that are the best CGI effects of the world falling apart, it seemed extremely ridiculous that the family running away from the world crumbling all around them, were always just a split second away from falling through the earth themselves.... all the way through the silly film.  It was so unrealistic that it upset me that I kept trying to appreciate the film, but I never could.<br /><br />This film insults your intelligence.  The movie \\"Deep Impact\\" approached the subject of an extinction level disaster much more realistically than this stupid movie did.  Does anyone else agree?
0385341008|5.0|wonderful book not to sure at first but loved it, amazing how a story can be told by just letters
B00008LOS1|5.0|In any sauce you wish to cook this album, the core strength of the songs is immutable: \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" alone propel the album into the pantheon of the forever great testimonies of rock 'n'roll. The previous (1995) edition was already wonderful, and so was the now despised first-edition CD. Frankly, the remastering does add some crispness to the whole, but I can't really tell what else makes it all that important. Okay, so we've remastered to heck and back, made money all over the place with the original edition, second edition, deluxe edition... and the SACD is probably not far off... but how about a bit of remixing? Now that would be truly useful, it seems to me. The Who albums are notoriously poorly mixed, and if you've read the liner notes for the 1995 version, you are no longer surprised: since everyone, including the band's manager and co-producer, was either shooting up during the sessions or in a perpetual alcoholic haze, god only knows what they heard in their heads when they recorded this. But some things that would definitely benefit from remixing are blatant. Take just \\"Fooled\\" for example: we have vocals up front, and the drums also straight ahead, giving the illusion of being everywhere, which is perfect and is the Who's trademark. So far so good. But we have both the bass and the electric guitar pushed into the left channel, and what is that buzzing mosquito sort of in the distance, desperately trying to be heard? Why it's an acoustic guitar, buried under the booming electric instruments because it has no space of its own - it, too, is way on the left, fighting for life so sadly that you have to wonder why it was used in the first place - unless you have a pretty decent pair of speakers or headphones, you're probably not even aware of its existence. This is because the synth got the right channel all to itself. I could speculate as to why this was necessary, and I'm sure that at the time of recording the technology made it necessary, but it really doesn't matter now - what does matter is that it could be improved, and it would change the recording in a significant manner - I mean, a whole other instrument to be heard, that's a pretty big change, right? Plus, unlike many remixes where stuff has been re-inserted that had been omitted the first time around because the consensus was that the song was better without it, in this case Pete and Roger should presumably be enchanted to have such \\"extra bits\\" brought to the fore - they never omitted it, they just buried it because they had no choice. Similar improvements could be made throughout the album.  As for the extra material, the deluxe edition includes selections and versions that in my mind are just that: extra material, in the hope that you'll buy the album because you want everything from The Who you can possibly lay your hands on. The 1995 edition's bonus tracks were sufficient, and they were and are undoubtedly a big bonus. \\"Pure and Easy\\" is surely one of Pete's most beautiful songs (I choose the word \\"beautiful\\" carefully, to convey its melodic grace, perfect compositional structure, and lyrical meaning - rather than exclusively power chords and rockin' appeal). And \\"Baby don't you do it\\" is a rare gem because the lads didn't always do covers with great seriousness - viz. their \\"Barbara Ann\\", you can just see Keith having a ball without any particular regard as to how the overall result might sound. Here, however, we're talking a serious achievement, a great rocker by a great band, with Mountain's Leslie West on the guitar just to embellish the tasty thing. And it's important to note that you can distinctly hear Leslie on the right, while toward the end Pete comes in on the left, as if to say, \\"I, too, can play solo, dammit.\\" And yes, he could. Because he spent most of his career with those enormous chords, he became underrated as a solo guitar player, and when he soloed on stage, the drawback was that there were no chords to backhim up. He was damned if he did, damned if he didn't. Every once in a while, in a studio recording, you can hear just what he was capable of; this is one of those times.

B002LLE3Q8|5.0|This album is the original progressive rock masterpiece.  Although I don't know a lot about the recording, I have heard it several times.  Robert Fripp was the major player behind this album but others contributed to it as well.  The music reminds me of ELP a little bit, or maybe Gentle Giant.  But this album truly started the progressive movement, which was largely centered in Britain at the time.  Many of today's bands are influenced by this as well, including The Mars Volta.    I gave this album 5 stars because all of the music is great.  All five tracks are excellent but in particular 21st Century Schizoid Man, Epitaph, and In the Court of the Crimson King stand out as perhaps the best material.  The music is very complicated and focused on instruments especially guitar.  It is noted for use of unusual instruments such as mellotron.    Buy this album, or at list give it a listen!  It just might expand your musical horizons and open your mind.
0312370849|5.0|After reading \\"Those Who Save Us\\" by Jenna Blum, I started reading this book and found it was not as descriptive concerning the horrific treatment of people during the Holocaust, which left me pretty depressed, but this story alternates in chapters with the tale of a little girl, Sarah, taken from her home with her star sewn on her clothes, and the journalist who delves into Sarah's past.  It's a lighter read and one I could not put down.  Both stories begin to connect and I liked the idea of the different chapters depicting  alternating worlds between the 1940's and 1990's.  The author has said this was not meant to be a historical novel--it had to have  a more contemporary feel to it, which it does.  I believe the ending could have been different and was too coincidental, but still found myself turning the pages and finishing this book quickly.  The lesson learned between both Blum and De Rosnay's books still will remain \\"We must not forget - We will not forget\\", whether it be a deeper version or a lighter fare.

Looking past the bad direction, writing and delivery of lines, I thought the actors were passable except for the guy who played Dali. I was only peripherally aware of Robert Pattinson's existence because of his \\"Twilight\\" movie fame, but I totally forgot he was in \\"Little Ashes\\" when I began watching it. I kept saying to myself this guy playing Dali was fresh from a high school theatre elective and was badly miscast. The other reviewer did the right thing by hitting \\"Eject\\" after 20 minutes of this DVD.

I personally do not like to have to purchase multiple copies of a movie or double or triple dip so to speak.

It is difficult to determine how accurate this description is although clearly as McDonald observes Lehman's risk managers failed appallingly to do their job and greed appears to have trumped `common sense' as Lehman poured more and more money into what to any thinking person was a very fragile real estate bubble.<br />Much of the rationale driving Lehman's focus on real estate apparently was a mantra which McDonald repeats at least five times in the book that \\"the U.S. real estate market has never dropped more the 5 per cent since the [great] depression.\\" Although he doesn't make it clear, it is this belief that must have made selling mortgages to people who clearly were major default risks an attractive proposition. This presumably was why Lehman and other investment banks bought these dubious mortgages and then bundled these \\"sub-prime\\" mortgages into \\"Collateralized Debt Obligations\\" (CDO). They assumed that even if the original mortgage holders defaulted, the value of real property would seemingly go up in price as would the mortgage to buy it. For the same reason the rating agencies, such as Fitch, gave the CDO triple A ratings; each mortgage in the package had appreciating real property as the ultimate collateral.  At least that is what one can infer from this book. This is also presumably why Lehman also found buying commercial development loans an attractive proposition and then bundling them into the commercial equivalent of a CDO, Collaterized Loan Obligations (CLO). Yet one also has the impression that these \\"wizards of Wall Street\\" were mentally isolated from the real world of tangible goods, services, and property. They thought only in terms money and paper without really caring about what the paper might represent in terms of the U.S. economy and the people that were the heart of that economy.e \\"wizards of Wall Street\\" were mentally isolated from the real world of tangible goods, services, and property.

B002VWNICW|3.0|I bought this for my wife who loves the movie and has been waiting for it to come out on blu-ray. Her wait was not rewarding though.  The blu-ray quality is disappointing.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand is addictive! The first episode is kind of cheesy with obvious CQI backgrounds etc... But as the show goes on you really start getting into the story. You feel for the characters and you find yourself on the edge of your seat hoping for certain outcomes. Often you are taken by surprise! Though the show is pretty explicit and violent it is not obscene, defiantly for adults though.  I highly recommend watching after the kids are put to bed. I'm not one to watch much TV but I do find myself throughout the week waiting for the next episode. If you read all the one star reviews you see that none of the people made it through the first episode... Albeit it's not going to be for everyone, however if you like a good action/drama this is it.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|We love this series of '24'.  I just read where this is the last season of 24 and it makes me very sad.  We always looked forward to \\"Jack Bower\\" and especially Chloe.  She is the greatest! Keifer Sutherland may be making '24' into a movie.  Something to look forward to.

B000002J09|5.0|5 out of 5 stars, no question. Maybe isn't perfect, but to me it seems damn close.<br />To call it the \\"Stairway to Heaven album\\", as great as that song is, is to shortchange the other seven.<br /><br />Zeppelin has huge stylistic range, and this album does a great job of tightly encapsulating that.<br /><br />Stairway: Led Zeppelin seemed to excel at songs with an epic-length-storytelling feel, with Stairway as the prime example. We still don't know exactly what the story is here, but after 39 years, I doubt we'll ever figure it out entirely. This song seems to have everything, as so many different sonic elements come together. And even after the culminating explosion of Page's epic guitar solo, they still ain't done. No other song is so gripping.<br /><br />The Battle Of Evermore has a similarly epic feel to it, and to me, it's the one that makes their Tolkien interest most obvious. The smooth integration between Plant's and Denny's vocals is handled brilliantly.<br /><br />From the first Zeppelin songs I heard, I was amazed by how well they fused heaviness with sophistication, intricacy, polish, whatever you wish to call it, it's something I feel many heavy bands miss. That's on full display in \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" in particular.<br /><br />Zeppelin's blues influences can't be denied, and while they have many such songs in that vein, \\"Levee\\" stands out because it seems to be the most uniquely 'Zeppelin' take on such material.<br /><br />The acidic feel of Misty Mountain Hop, itself with classic Zep instrumentation, seems to be in part a parody of hippie music, and Going to California is in part their attempt at an actual hippie song. Both succeed in that and in many other aspects.<br /><br />My favorite album ever, with my favorite song ever. And for darn good reasons.
0451228731|4.0|For some strange reason, I couldn't get this out of my head. I'd see it at every book store imaginable, and I kept passing it up. Until finally, I gave in! I admit it. And if you're looking of something a little out of the ordinary with plenty of action to keep you going, then DAEMON might just be for you.<br /><br />Ok, NEWS FLASH...Matthew Sobol is dead. So what? Right? Wrong. Because although a legend of computer games might be rotting in his grave, he's still striking somewhere, through what we learn as Daemon. And this thing is killing people, and people aren't exactly able to stop what it does. So with Sobol in the grave, this crazy thing wreaks havoc on humanity and on society, or rather hacks into society, and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Peter Sebek is caught in the middle, and the world is looking to him, despite his lack of game knowledge. And the FBI, CIA, NSA, more like all of the above are doing what they can to contain this thing. In a world of deception where everybody looks out for #1, either the Daemon can be the god you never serve, or it can be a lifesaver, depending on who's side you're on.<br /><br />Let me get one thing straight. I don't agree with a viewpoint out there that offers no belief in God. Thinking like that is pathetic, and it allows constipated thinking that says there is no hope. So in the end, I can't wait to read the follow-up Suarez has to offer, \\"Freedom,\\" but I don't buy his theory, unless his sole purpose is to offer up some great entertainment. If entertainment is his only goal, then that alone deserves my 4 stars. But to take it seriously? Not in my lifetime. But I enjoyed the thrill!!
0385342039|4.0|This story was really cute. I wasn't sure about it when I started it but quickly learned it had certain trademarks of some of Kinsella's books, like an annoying sister character, a strained parental relationship, and some struggle in the workplace. Of course the odd family dynamic takes an even stranger turn when the main character, Lara, starts seeing the ghost of her great-aunt Sadie, which makes Lara seem like a nut job throughout much of the story. There are alot of hide your face embarrassing moments that you want to make better. Kinsella does do a great job of making you like Sadie and Lara, and really wanting everything to be okay for the ghost and Lara, both for the task at hand and Lara's professional and personal life. I do think that she could have worked out Lara and Ed's relationship a bit more. It seems a bit shortened in spots or something, and it would have added a bit more interest to the last bit of the book. The last couple of chapters almost seem hasty. That is the reason why it got 4 stars instead of 5.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This dvd opened my eyes to a lot of practices in the food industry such as the possibility of having up 1,000 different cows in a single hamburger patty. I quickly stopped letting my child eat certain foods after seeing what the mother on this film went through. It helped me make better decisions about food quality and I plan to watch it every now and then to remind me of why I don't eat certain food anymore. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little faster in its delivery and they probably could've gotten a lot more intense footage if they let people and locations remain confidential. That way we might have been able to go inside chicken houses, etc and people not get let out of their contracts as a result. Overall, great film!
0440242401|3.0|I guess I had higher expectations having just read \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" which I adored. The book started off interestingly enough in the first 2 chapters, even if it was a bit Lifetime movie-ish. I thought it would gain speed and start to flesh out. But that is how it stayed--like a Lifetime movie. I suppose it is hard to be too involved with characters when they themselves don't know who they are, but still...There were parts that had me chuckling and feeling pity, and I was still cheering for more. But that was what it was, I always cheering for more, and more never really happened. I tend to re-read the last chapter of a book a few hours after I finish it because there is usually something grabbing or completing, and I enjoy the final moments. Instead, I just sort of went \\"okay\\" closed the book and that was it. I finished it yesterday and already I am forgetting parts. Just not memorable.

160024842X|5.0|I listened to this audiobook and have to say it's one of the best books I've listened to or read.  There was very strong character development and an emotionally powerful story line, one that leaves the reader wondering about life and death long after finishing the book.    It seemed a bit long, but after it was over I found myself wishing it wasn't.    I highly recommend this book for anyone who has experienced the loss of a loved one.  Just make sure you have a box of tissues nearby as you will probably need them.

B00337KM2S|2.0|What is with the adoration for this movie.  Stupid premise (are there really companies who are contracted out to fire employees of other companies - I doubt it), and a plodding plot line that made no sense in the end.  And Clooney was better in other movies, including Burn After Reading.  I only gave it two stars because somehow I made it to the ambiguous ending.   (Serious Man I turned off after ten minutes).
B001992NUQ|4.0|I have to admit from the beginning that I had never seen FIGHT CLUB before 2010. Yes (hangs head in shame), I'd heard all the hype and thought it to be just that: hype. Although I did notice that most of the kudos came from guys, not gals, even though the well-built Brad Pitt ([[ASIN:B002T9H2L0 Inglourious Basterds]]) was liberally smeared on cover displays along with witty (and not unhandsome) Edward Norton ([[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]]). Hmm. So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu-Ray copy.<br /><br />Although brutal along the lines of [[ASIN:B000LPS4BG GoodFellas]], Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark. It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter ([[ASIN:B001BN1ZHW Sweeney Todd]]). I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles. She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.<br /><br />If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.<br /><br />And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together. In 1995 they did the excellent film [[ASIN:B001RV53RG Seven]]. If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one. Fincher loves to play mind-twists but he doesn't do it in a heavy-handed way or even in a directly misguiding one (unlike M. Night Shyamalan with his groundbreaking [[ASIN:B001BRZ5J2 The Sixth Sense]]).<br /><br />Although the twist towards the end was enjoyable, I was an astute enough viewer to realize what was going on long before its reveal. Which didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.<br /><br />Some of those who haven't seen the film might want a kind of blow-by-blow description ...and many reviews like that can easily be found. DON'T READ THEM! They will absolutely ruin the film for you. I have, in the past (and probably will in the future), given descriptions of films, but not here. This one needs to be experienced without foreknowledge. Kind of like a surprise punch to the face...eviews like that can easily be found. DON'T READ THEM! They will absolutely ruin the film for you.

0393324818|5.0|\\"We take fifty guys (in the draft) and we celebrate if two of them make it.  In what other business is two for fifty a success?  If you did that in the stock market, you'd go broke.\\"  Billy Beane.<br /><br />Billy Beane was a supremely talented major league prospect who somehow never made it to the big leauges.  However, his contribution to baseball is far reaching.  The volatile and enigmatic Beane, as GM of the Oakland Athletics, brings analytics and economics into the mainstream operations of running a ball club.  This new management approach represented a sea change in baseball philosophy and is the basis of Michael Lewis' dynamic page-turner, Moneyball.<br /><br />Lewis has a financial analyst background (his latest book, The Big Short, about the free fall of the US economy, was just released) and is able to describe Beane's thought process in economic terms.  Specifically, that some player statistics (for example, On Base Percentage) were undervalued relative to other statistics (for instance, Slugging Percentage) and that created market inefficiencies, read buying opportunities, for small-market teams like the Oakland Athletics.  The market inefficiencies allowed Oakland to compete across a number of years with the likes of large-market teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox.<br /><br />The book documents the \\" religious war\\" between traditional scouting, which has  been goverened mainly by a scout's gut instinct, and a new methodology, based on rigorous statistical analysis.  Some of Beane's operational principles cut against the grain of conventional wisdom.<br /><br />--On Base Percentage is more important than Slugging Percentage in determining a player's worth,<br />--Drafting college prospects has a demonstrably higher chance of success than drafting high school prospects.<br />--Sacrifice bunting and stealing bases are, statistically-speaking, poor moves.<br /><br />After his fledgling playing career came to an end, Beane got his start with Oakland from then current GM Sandy Alderson - an Ivy---League educated, military trained disciple of little known baseball statistical guru Bill James.  Alderson told Billy to go out and find undervalued players.  However, Alderson's charge needed some intellectual firepower.  For that, Beane hired Ivy-league educated Paul DePodesta as his statistical right-hand-man.<br /><br />The analytical, objective lineage was passed from Bill James (and his ilk) to Alderson to Beane to DePodesta carried on to other teams with the hiring of J.P. Ricciardi by Toronto and Theo Epstein by Boston.  The Moneyball philosophy  is now embraced by almost all MLB teams.<br /><br />Moneyball however is more than just a statistics lesson.  It is a fascinating personality study of Billy Beane and an inside look at the entire front office operations of the Oakland A's.  The book makes readers feel as if they are inside the draft room when decisions are being made.  Readers will no longer think about the annual baseball draft or, for that matter, watch a baseball game in quite the same way.<br /><br />[...] Rating  Home Run  (a fantastic read, whether you are a baseball fan, a historian, a Sabremetrician, or a MBA student)League educated, military trained disciple of little known baseball statistical guru Bill James.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|As a film, Avatar is the Star Wars of this generation, in more ways than one.  Its story is mostly derivative, taking some of the best elements from dozens of stories that have already been told, and covering it with a glossy coat of paint the likes of which filmgoers have never seen.  Also like Star Wars, its journey from concept to completion took so long that its creator was able to write more stories within the universe (the forthcoming sequels).  I enjoyed this movie, despite its flaws, much like I enjoyed the original Star Wars: familiar, predictable, simple, and a feast for the eyes. \\"Greatest movie ever?\\" Not really.  Groundbreaking and entertaining piece of cinema history?  In my book, yes.    That said, I'll definitely be getting this on Blu-ray for showing off my HDTV.    (Editorial note: As for everyone who hates others for hating things you like: it's called fanboyism, and it's as narrow-minded as any other sort of prejudice.)

I started listening and tried to turn up the volume so I could hear it, then I realized that not only was the narrator getting louder but the STATIC WAS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER! The sound quality was so bad that turning up the volume just made it worse. They must be recorded at 8 or 16 kbps, if you don't know--that's really bad.<br /><br />$50 or more for this cheaply made, plastic mp3 player with the cheapest, flimsy headphones that they could get. Don't do it, don't buy these. You will regret it. Don't waste your money. Use your own mp3 discs and mp3 player. At least you'll be able to understand what's going on.
B000002GK1|5.0|'Badmotorfinger' would have to be one of the most under-rated albums of its time. It certainly got a bit lost among 'Nevermind' and 'Ten', with some people even drawing comparisons to the squillion-selling duo to conclude this album was a flop. But while certainly less accessible, 'Badmotorfinger' is easily the best of the early 90's grunge albums. Soundgarden were heavier than most other Seattle bands, but they were also much artier as well. So 'Badmotorfinger' both hits harder and has more interesting diversions than the offerings from Nirvana or Pearl Jam.<br /><br />While there's plenty of the typical \\"grunge\\" sound on offer here, 'Badmotorfinger' is full of unusual ideas. The heavy Sabbath-like riffing of 'Outshined' or 'Slaves and Bulldozers', the nightmarshing dissonant squall of 'Jesus Christ Pose', the almost mantra-like 'Mind Riot', the frenetic punky 'Drawing Flies' or 'Face Pollution'. Also, the psychadelic influences that would characterise 'Superunknown' are clearly evident, most notably in Kim Thayil's guitar lines (the main riff of 'Rusty Cage', the swirling drone of 'Room A Thousand Years Wide'). And there's also a clear prog-rock feel to many songs: odd time signatures, unconventional tunings, tempo changes, stop-start dynamics, out-of-nowhere spiralling sax blasts. All these odd diversions keep the music sounding fresh and interesting twenty years later; unlike some other grunge albums, 'Badmotorfinger' doesn't feel dated or of-its-time.<br /><br />While it does lack the immediate pop hooks and polished production of 'Superunknown', these are twelve strong songs with twelve memorable choruses and riffs. 'Badmotorfinger' is a consistent, powerful album that hits really hard at gut level, while also providing plenty of challenging material to get your head around. Highly recommended.

B0036XN2L2|5.0|I have been a fan for over 30 years and never get tired of listening to them and this cd is no different. I first saw them in the late 70s opening for ted nugent and I have been a fan since. They are the hardest working band of all time and there live performances are spectacular. Listen to it loud and enjoy. Klaus is amazing still at 61 years of age and though it is sad to see them go I am sure it will be even harder for them.Thanks for almost 40 years of music that has occupied most of my music listening. I have purchased 5 copies and hope to get one signed at monsters of rock this june. SCORPIONS there is no one like you. IF you love the scorpions lets support them and make this another gold album.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This album has always been a favorite of mine, even though I don't play it so often nowadays.  I bought it on record in the 70's when I was about 13.  I even like the cover art, but it doesn't look as good in small CD form, the 12 inch vinyl gate fold sleeve is where you most appreciate it.  The best songs are perhaps Citadel, 2000 Man and 2000 Light Years... but really I like ALL  of them,  even though I feel the mixing could sometimes be better - on Citadel and 2000 Man, Jagger's voice is mixed too far back.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Supposedly this is the last film Eastwood will appear in.<br /><br />Frankly I believe this because he looks like warmed over death (and it's not the makeup) and titers around the screen looking like he is going to tip over at any moment.<br /><br />He pulls from his quiver the usual gruff, no BS, hard characterization to play a recently widowed retired auto worker who finds his neighborhood, to his displeasure, largely populated with Moungs. There develops a relationship between him and some of his neighbors whom he slowly comes to like.  Alienated from his own sons he starts to mentor the boy next door who lacks a father figure and is under pressure to join a gang.<br /><br />Eastwood has made many many moves.  Some terrible in ever aspect, some well crafted.  Consistency in quality is not Eastwood's strong suit.<br /><br />The film is good, not one of his top efforts but worth watching.  If you like Eastwood's acting then this is a must see as it is apparently the end of an era.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I only bought this album because I was trying to reach the $25 free shipping minimum. I'm glad I got it though!<br /><br />Alicia Keys has been a great artist since her debut Songs In A Minor, but I was hesitant to purchase this album because I hadn't really heard any songs. Now, it's on constant rotation in my car and home.<br /><br />Alicia is definitely freer on this album. She's such a gifted song writer, pianist and singer, that she really can't go wrong!<br /><br />I would strongly recommend the purchase of her CD.
B001HN694K|3.0|If you're looking for a modern version of the original tale Alice in Wonderland, you won't find it here.  Now, if you're no longer familiar with the fable, you might want to flip through the novel version to help you through.  This movie should be called Alice Returns to Wonderland (at age 19, obviously with amnesia about her journey there as a 7 year old) or simply ALICE, who is still as mouthy and defiant as the novel-protagonist.  But definitely not as cute.    Young children who have never seen the Disney version or read the Disney book will surely be confused by the complicated poetry (stanzas from Lewis Caroll's \\"Jabberwocky\\" thrown in to assure everyone that a battle with the monstrous Jabberwock is coming up) and other squeeze-ins that don't really seem to make much sense to a young viewer.  Most kids from 3-7 might want to break it down to this question..is the red Queen bad?  There is also a white queen, poorly played by Anne Hathaway.  The white queen tries to make herself appear feminine and ethereal but spoofs with her pretentious swanning around(and what's with the awful Goth lipstick?)  I will say the costuming was superb but the makeup and wigs, just amatuerish.  Even Mad Hatter's orange eyebrows looked glued on.    The movie also gives Johnny Depp, the Mad Hatter (previously a minor though memorable character in the original book), a fleshy and admirable role.  In the original, he's gross in his troll like ugliness with no interest in Alice whatsoever.  In this \\"sequel\\" he is colourful, attractive and charmingly persuasive of Alice's help..she is after all the 'one' to slay the Jabberwock and return their Queer-dom to the white queen.  True Hollywood style, there's a strange 'attraction' between Hatter and Alice, who has just turned down her a wedding proposal back on Earth.    If I can stretch my interpretation here...one of the later scenes paints Alice as some sort of Joan of Arc venturing to slay the Jabberwock dragon against the Red Queen (whoI see as a reference to Queen Elizabeth I).  The white queen dare I say was an allusion to her half-sister Mary Queen of Scots.    On a final note Alice in Wonderland, the original was silly, bizarre but oddly witty.  Tim Burton's rendering of Alice in the Future is as well bizarre but macabre (chopped off human heads floating in the castle moat that Alice has to step on to enter the red queen's castle).  Not to mention LOUD!  Bring ear plugs for the kids.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is so thought provoking that I've decided to send copies to everyone I know. It is really eye-opening to discover where our food is coming from and why this nation's continues to pack on the pounds.<br /><br />Many parts made me angry; others made me sad. Overall, it's definitely changed how I view food -- what I eat and chose to buy. This documentary should be shown in schools, at town hall meetings and on regular television.<br /><br />I, for one, will be contacting my Congress people to demand some changes because if things continue down the same path, America is in big trouble!
B0027BOL4G|3.0|This is a topic I am very interested in and wanted my family to see, however this dvd is so insanely slow and boring that I have not been able to watch it thru to the end yet. My kids walked away very early on as did my husband. Its an important topic, and I am not criticizing that, its just simply way too slow and you wind up drifing off.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie has one of those special wonderful stories that puts it in a class all by itself.  The story equals anything you may have seen in live action films.

It has become one of my favorites.
B00164EAC8|4.0|First, let me start off by saying that this movie is no Godzilla, in the traditional sense. What one has to remember is to watch this movie without thinking that it's a Godzilla movie, it's simply a very good American kaiju movie. Once you get past the \\"Godzilla\\" brand name, it's entirely possible to enjoy this movie.    Now, with that said, you cannot ask for a better science fiction movie than Tri-Star's Godzilla. It really is an enjoyable movie. With recognizable talent such as Matthew Broderick (The Producers, Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Jean Reno (Ronin, The Professional) and Hank Azaria (The Simpsons), the movie has a lot of acting taltn to go around.    Matthew Broderick headlines the movie as the protagonist of the movie who discovers the nature of Godzilla's origin and ends up discovering the fact that the monster is about to lay hundreds of eggs, which could hatch and be unleashed upon the world, signifying the end of the human race. With Hank Azaria, Jean Reno and many others, they eventually discover how to stop Godzilla from hatching the eggs. Many who are reading this review have undoubtedly watched this movie before.    However, if you're contemplating purchasing this movie on Blu-ray, you will not be disappointed. I've watched this movie on a Samsung 32\\" 720p HDTV and the quality is astounding and very impressive. If you have a chance to purchase this movie on Blu-ray, I would highyl recommend it. You won't be disappointed.

B00009L1UP|5.0|This is not only one of the best music albums of the 1990's, it is one of the best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal albums of all time.     You hear about those special albums that come along every so often, where there's not a bad song on the album...this is one of them.      With fantastic songs like the classic \\"Silent Lucidity\\", the passionate rocking love ballads like \\"Hands On Heart\\" and \\"One and Only\\"  to the great title track,the upbeat \\"Best I Can\\", and the heartfelt, spirited, fantastic epic song \\"Anybody Listening?\\" this album rocks.  The remastered edition is even better, because it contains one of Queensyryche's hardest and best songs of all time....\\"Last Time In Paris\\".  The song is fast, hard, and funny as well.      Queensryche's \\"Empire\\" will go down as one of the best hard rock/metal albums of all time, along with Led Zeppelin \\"4\\"(pretty much any Led Zeppelin album), Bon Jovi's \\"Slippery When Wet\\" and \\"New Jersey\\", AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\",Metallica's \\"Black Album\\", Guns N Roses \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" etc.
1400032717|4.0|I have just learned something: there does not seem to be a character limit on blog post titles. If for no other reason, British author Mark Haddon's novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, has been helpful in this regard. (In the spirit of generosity, I will also attest to Haddon's wisdom in neglecting to include a subtitle.)    Fortunately, the virtues of this work extend far beyond its function as a test of software capabilities, as Haddon lends a powerful voice to a mentally disabled boy living in England. At once a mystery novel and a compelling journey into the mind of a very unique child, The Curious Incident is savvy enough to allow the reader wide room for interpretation while still relating an extraordinarily accessible tale (and in the first person, no less). Christopher John Francis Boone is an autistic child living with his father in Swindon. (In an interview, the author preferred to define the protagonist's condition somewhat more ambiguously, stating that \\"there is a very true sense in which there is something more wrong with the people around Christopher than with him.\\" A bit trite, yes, but not without validity.)    Throughout the course of the story, it becomes obvious that -- surprise, surprise -- not all is as it seems in Christopher-land. And yes, it is as if he inhabits an alternate world, likely one of his own making or, at the very least, bounded by the despotic tics that frequently shut down both his mental and physical faculties. When composed, however, Christopher is something of a math prodigy, and his embrace of sheer logic (however illogical his idea of rationality may be) is as heartwarming as it is frightening. In a rather characteristic example, Christopher postulates on the difference between his memory and the imagination of his peers: \\"Other people have pictures in their heads, too,\\" he writes. \\"But they are different because the pictures in my head are all pictures of things which really happened. But other people have pictures in their heads of things which aren't real and didn't happen.\\"    Like many children, Christopher is often funny without intending to be, but his limited mental agility renders his many evaluations of his experiences extremely affecting. It is not what he takes note of, but instead what he does not, that exudes the beauty and sadness of a life lived within the constricting walls of mental illness. And in a strange way, Mark Haddon's seemingly cliched remark about Christopher is spot-on: the childlike gravitation towards (il)logical deduction provides a far more elegant form of commentary than do the voices of those surrounding him. Christopher concludes his journey secure in the knowledge that \\"[he] can do anything.\\" Readers will have little trouble believing that, but Mark Haddon's challenge with his next novel will be attempting to live up to Christopher's high standards.

0385512058|5.0|The book is actually three different themes artfully weaved together, informing and reinforcing one another.      Keith Ferrazzi's own journey from a small steel town in Pennsylvania to the executive suites of Starwood Hotels & Davos World Economic forum is inspirational.      The book details specific advice and practical strategies for establishing and keeping connected with your network.  He elaborates actionable advice for finding mentors, managing gatekeepers, building your brand, pinging and following up.     While all these tips from an artful practitioner are valuable, he delves into a more profound theme as we progress into the book. He espouses a way of life built on symbiotic social relationships and social karma - a way of life build around generosity, social arbitrage by helping connect those in need with those who can help, and not keeping a score. He perceptively identifies the emergence of a connected age and a new way to create and reach markets through social networks.
0393075966|4.0|\\"As the United States entered the first Gulf War in 1990, General Colin Powell articulated what came to be called the Powell Doctrine, one element of which included attacking with decisive force. There should be something analogous in economics, perhaps the Krugman-Stiglitz doctrine.\\"    Yes, Joseph Stiglitz, the author of Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy, has a fan. This ardent devotee is not, as one might suspect, a fellow academic scrawling her mark of approval onto the book's cover, nor a book reviewer writing for a newspaper or magazine. It's not even Paul Krugman, although presumably he too has fallen victim to the spell of his fellow Nobel laureate.    No, the fan is Joseph Stiglitz himself, the author of both the book Freefall and the above quote, found in its second chapter. And as self-aggrandizing as he can tend to be -- he joins the litany of economists, politicians, and pundits who vociferously trumpet their early predictions of the current financial crisis -- his words are bolstered by an undeniably credible resumé. As the former chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, the senior vice president and chief economist at the World Bank, and the 2001 Nobel Prize winner in economics, Stiglitz has combined his enviable pedigree as a top-notch economist with the political savvy gained through spending many years in the halls of power.    In the course of reading Freefall, it soon becomes abundantly clear that Stiglitz is not especially fond of deregulation. However, in a departure from the current American zeitgeist, he does not embrace populist rhetoric or condemn bankers unduly for their greed. (In writing this last sentence, I vacillated between enclosing greed in quotes or not; either choice seems equally prejudiced, so I arbitrarily chose not to.) \\"Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so, and that is what has to be changed,\\" Stiglitz writes. \\"Besides, the basis of capitalism is the pursuit of profit: should we blame the bankers for doing (perhaps a little better) what everyone in the market economy is supposed to be doing?\\"    This is an interesting question, and one that is not normally asked in today's politically charged environment. And yet Stiglitz is just about the furthest thing from an apologist for the banking industry. Responding to central bankers' claims that allowing inflation hurts those with low incomes, Stiglitz deadpans, \\"One should be suspicious when one hears bankers take up the cause of the poor.\\" Elsewhere, he states that \\"there is an obvious solution to the too-big-to-fail banks: break them up. If they are too big to fail, they are too big to exist.\\"    Obviously, large-scale problems in the financial sector led to the collapse of the markets and the economy at large, but Freefall is not content to stop at causes. The responses by both the Bush and Obama administrations come under heavy fire too: the former for not recognizing the severity of the crisis or forming a coherent rescue, and the latter for choosing the politically safest responses (tellingly, the author dubs this the \\"muddling through\\" approach). A key problem, if Stiglitz is to be believed, is the misalignment of private and social benefits. When banking executives' compensation is based upon short-term stock price gains instead of long-term profitability, when regulators and top government officials at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury turn a blind eye to the mounting risks in the housing bubble to avoid slowing perceived economic growth, when financial innovations that produce high fees and low efficiency are encouraged instead of fined or prohibited, eventually there will be hell to pay, and we as taxpayers will be the ones paying it.    Indeed, this is exactly what we're doing right now. Regardless of one's feelings on Stiglitz's policy prescriptions -- some of which, not unlike those of his earlier book, Making Globalization Work, appear more grounded in political idealism than in reality -- the fact remains that it has fallen to the taxpaying public to bear the risk created by the masterminds of Big Finance's increasingly complex securities and other derivatives. To Stiglitz, this is ample reason to hit the reset button on the American financial industry -- or perhaps more accurately, the reformat button. His vision is of a world of free markets, yes, but not completely unfettered and left to their own whimsies.    Instead, President Stiglitz would beef up the regulatory framework: ensuring that banks' leverage ratios do not stray too high, that conflicts of interest (such as banks running their own real estate appraisal subdivisions) cannot occur, that predatory lending is prohibited (or at least heavily restricted), etc. Furthermore, Keynesian economics would experience a renaissance. (Stiglitz has little patience with the Chicago school, which he finds too theoretical and based on fallacious assumptions anyway. In one of the author's weakest moments, he shamelessly deconstructs a straw man only vaguely resembling actual conservative ideology.) A global reserve currency would be created, similar (but not identical) to the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDR), to prevent the contagion of a worldwide crisis started by one currency's downward spiral.    By the time one has finished this book, it seems that there is not much to look forward to in Joseph Stiglitz's version of world events. He sees a financial market in disarray, being slowly rebuilt by the same hands that led to its destruction and leading inevitably to another instance of the same shortsightedness followed by more devastation. This is a hard pill to swallow, but it sheds light on why Joseph Stiglitz chose to write this book so soon after the financial earthquake. An undesirable future can be prevented, and we're in the ideal scenario to start again from the rubble. By the time the economy begins showing serious signs of recovery, all resolve to change course will have evaporated. And so the gods of irony may be leaving us a silver lining after all in this prolonged economic massacre: the longer we suffer from the effects of past miscalculations and neglect, the more time we have to formulate a new, healthy, and safe framework to avoid a recurrence.

B001PKHS68|4.0|This has to be regarded as something less than a completely successful film.  There are many reasons to watch and enjoy this movie, including the extraordinary location shots and seeing the surreally gorgeous romantic lovers Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. The location shooting was quite unusual.  Hitchcock famously hated shooting on location.  He detested how much time it took and how much he was at the mercies of the weather. The helicopter shots of the car chase at the beginning remain among the most breathtaking of the fifties and anticipate some of the visual aspects of the James Bond films.<br /><br />As an aside and continuing the James Bond connection, the influence of Hitchcock on the Bond films cannot be overstated.  Many of the suspense scenes in the Bond films utilized many of the narrative techniques that Hitchcock pioneered, but they also utilized the exotic locales utilized in both NOTORIOUS (which was a film, after all, about espionage) and TO CATCH A THIEF.  There is actually a quote of a Hitchcock film in the way that Sean Connery's Bond makes his first appearance.  In NOTORIOUS the back of the head of Cary Grant's character Devlin is shown for a significant period of time before his face is shown.  Similarly, Connery's head was shown from behind in a casino for several seconds before the camera cuts to his face and his utters his famous initial line in the series, \\"Bond.  James Bond.\\" But the introduction of Bond was lifted directly from NOTORIOUS.<br /><br />The film represented Cary Grant's return to cinema after a very short retirement, undertaken in part because of his anger at the mistreatment of actors, directors, and writers by the HUAC hearings in the first wave of the Red Scare in Hollywood, especially the abuse of Charlie Chaplin, and at his disgust at the increasing dominance of method actors.  But the retirement didn't last very long at all and the chance to make a big budget film with Alfred Hitchcock and Grace Kelly in France was irresistible.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about Hitchcock in the early fifties was the way that he was constantly experimenting with the new film technologies that were being invented to make the movies more and more exciting in an attempt to entice people into coming to the movies.  The movie was filmed in a three-strip process that provides an unbelievable degree of clarity and detail.  The colors are remarkably vivid and it was made in true stereo.  He had also made REAR WINDOW in a widescreen format, following DIAL M FOR MURDER, which was not only widescreen but in 3D.  He would continue to push the technical possibilities of film all the way through PSYCHO and THE BIRDS, but he never allows the film technique take over from the narrative.<br /><br />Critical opinion of TO CATCH A THIEF is divided.  Some regard it as one of his masterpieces.  Some see it as standing considerably below his best fifties work like STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and PSYCHO (released in 1960 but filmed in 1959). I'm definitely in the latter class.  I find the film interesting at times, the location shots mesmerizing, and the two leads delightful, but I find the overall story weak.  Among the \\"wrong man\\" stories that he filmed, this is among my least favorite (my least favorite being the blatantly named THE WRONG MAN). The film can be profitably studied by film students, but I simply don't find the film as emotionally gripping as his best films from his so-called Golden Period.  In my own ranking of Hitchcock's fifty-odd films, I would rank this in the 15 to 20 range, probably closer to 20 than 15.  A film definitely worth seeing and then seeing again, but not quite up to the level of his greatest films.<br /><br />The scene where Grace Kelly drives wildly along the treacherous road is tough to take because she died in a car crash not too far from where these scenes were filmed (the extended scene is a combo of on location scenes and back shots in the studio) after suffering a stroke. Real life imbues the scene with meaning for us that did not exist for anyone seeing it at the time.<br /><br />One awkward moment in the film comes from watching Charles Vanel perform his role.  He could speak no English at all and it is excruciating watching the remarkably poor dubbing job.<br /><br />On a personal sidenote, I rewatched this with Shirley, one of my two solid black cats - sisters - on my lap. She bears a striking resemblance to the black cat used in repeated shots in the film. She had no opinion on the film.Real life imbues the scene with meaning for us that did not exist for anyone seeing it at the time.

0393072231|5.0|If you read only one book on the financial crisis -- probably too late for that! -- this should be the one.  Lewis knows his way around Wall Street and managed to locate a number of people who early on realized that once the housing bubble popped, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) would plummet in value.  In telling the story of these investors, he provides a vivid account of how the market for MBS and CDOs worked.  He also provides what is by far the best explanation of credit default swaps and how they were misused.  At the heart of the problem in Lewis's telling are Moody's and S&P who were apparently too scared of losing the business of rating MBS and CDOs to ask the relevant questions that would have revealed just how risky these securities were.    A couple of small quibbles:  As with Lewis's other books, the characters in this one may be just a tad too colorful to be completely believable.  Some of the anecdotes also read as if they may have been improved on, if just a trifle.  More seriously, because Lewis is interested in telling a good story rather than writing an analytical treatise or providing a carefully documented history, some of the larger issues are lost in the details of the deals being carried out by the investors he focuses on.  The last chapter is a partial rewrite of the article he wrote for Portfolio magazine in which he describes a lunch with John Gutfreund, Lewis's old boss from his days as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers.  In that chapter, Lewis repeats his view that it was Gutfreund's decision to take Salomon public that set in motion the train of events that ultimately led Wall Street investment banks to the calamity we have just lived through.  An interesting argument, but one that would have been better made at the beginning of the book and then used to help understand the story of the meltdown as it unfolds in the book.  But that structure would have made the book more analytical at the expense of probably reducing some of its entertainment value.      Quibbles aside, if you want to understand the financial crisis, you have to read this book.    A final note to the many people who have been leaving reviews entirely based on issues related to the Kindle:  You do realize that you are doing a disservice to the people who are expecting reviews to be substantive discussions of the book, right?
B0031RAOVY|5.0|As the owner of an Akita for almost 12 years (now at 'The Bridge'), I have been anxiously waiting for the Hachiko Monogatari, 1987 Japanese production, to be adapted for the American audience. I was so pleased that they kept the story simple; one of a man and his dog, of forging bonds of unconditional love and devotion. And, even though I knew the story very well and, prepared myself in advance, the tears were inevitable.<br /><br />Going straight to DVD, this film will not be a big money maker, therefore, I consider it a timeless gift and treasure, from all involved with the project.  It was not easy, taking a year to complete, clearly becoming a labor of love.  Watching Gere interact with the dogs, you can tell he is truly in his element. The joy on his face makes you believe that Hachi really is his devoted companion. I truly thank and respect Gere for joining such a challenging endeavor and I can't think of anyone more perfect for the role of the sensitive Professor.<br /><br />Throughout the film, it was made fairly clear, that Akitas are not typical dogs. This was further evidenced in the 'Making of the Film.'  The trainers thought they had met their match, when two months into the project, the dogs simply would not perform.  They found that Akitas are no trick-ponies; they are stubborn and don't suffer foolish tasks.  With much patience, the project was eventually successful. You will also find a comment following the credits about how Akitas are NOT for everyone.  I consider these additions to the film to represent responsible education regarding Akita ownership, and, I applaud them for the inclusions.<br /><br />I must add, that although I dearly love Akitas, they are not the only breed with histories of bravery and devotion.  Given proper training and bonding, some mixed breed dogs that we unfortunately see chained in backyards, might show the same call of duty. It's not so much about the breed, but creating the connection---opening one's heart, and truly letting that furry creature in, which Gere lovingly demonstrates in the film.<br /><br />I think Hachiko's story is a good reminder, that ALL dogs have thinking, emotive minds; that they are, family, not something to be possessed. That said, Hachi will continue to educate us from the grave, for generations to come.  I can't think of a more profound legacy.<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered, family film---one that, once watched, will never be forgotten. It is destined to become a classic.  I can't recommend it highly enough; just have tissues at hand.eature in, which Gere lovingly demonstrates in the film.

0393072231|4.0|This is another of those OMG! books I read every now and then to counter any undue optimism I may be feeling. And, sure enough, about 30 pages in, my eyes began bunging out and my head felt like it was going to explode.    In this tale of the greed and arrogance that caused the great meltdown of 2008, even Lewis' heroes are villains--there are no redeeming characters in this story--just greedy bastards eager to rip each other (and you!) off.    This is a narrative of the easily-predicted subprime mortgage debacle and the few astute players who saw it clearly enough to go short when everyone else was going long. In other words, they bet against the big investment banks and insurance companies and made a killing as the US economy lay wounded and dying. Of course, those who tried to warn everyone of the looming disaster were ignored, or worse. So, who can blame them? They got theirs and we got screwed.    Lewis provides a basic primer on all things subprime--mortgage bonds, tranches, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and something called a synthethic CDO, made up entirely of toxic subprime mortgage bonds. He also explains the culpability of the so-called rating agencies--Moody's, S&P's, and Fitch's, who enabled the big steal being perpetrated by the big banks and insurance companies. It couldn't have been pulled off without them.    In addition to buying and selling financial \\"instruments\\" composed of total crap, the big banks leveraged themselves beyond any known rule of safety. Leverage (the amount of exposure to risk for every dollar invested) went from 20 to 1 to as high as 33 to 1. This is what caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and the implosion of the entire financial system when the subprime mortgage market began unraveling in 2007.    What really irks me about this sad story is that everyone in on the scam acted as though it was a big game. And, while some of them lost a lot of money, none of them lost everything. Which is something you can't say about their victims--you and me and our children.    My advice? Skip this book if you're feeling the least bit depressed.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I cannot believe that this movie won Best Picture. What was the Academy thinking???  The writing was poor, the acting mediocre at best. The action in this film was very predictable and not suspenseful. I was VERY disappointed with this film. I am glad I rented it before I purchased it. I would not recommend this film for purchase. It simply is not worth the money.  The most absurd part was one of the last scenes, where the \\"doc\\" was trying to get some locals to move their cart... you knew he was going to get it in the end.. are people that stupid?? Come on.. where is the credibility here? While the story is okay for the most part, I am sure this film does not do justice to what our soldiers actually go through in the field.  I support our troops, but I cannot support the poor quality and judgement of the film makers of this film.

You cannot deny that this is one of Andrews best works showing vast eclectic talent for writing music.<br /><br />However, the poor and prosaic lyrics (please- can you not rhyme every other rhyme with simple rhymes like goodbye and sky all the time)really bring down the beauty of the score. Also, the abysmal book does not help matters either!<br /><br />Love Never Dies! Really?

0393072231|3.0|Very much along the lines of Zuckerman's \\"The Greatest Trade Ever,\\" Lewis explores the cast of characters who correctly deduced that the sub-prime fall was inevitable. Lewis' book arguably had much of its thunder stolen by being beaten to market by Zuckerman. Deciding between the two books, Zuckerman is marginally ahead, but Lewis' treatise covers enough new material and his style is different enough to make The Big Short a worthwhile read. It is an easy, uncomplicated read and flows quite well. It is not technical in nature, but should be more viewed as a populist commentary of characters and events. Lewis' analysis can't be viewed as being too in-depth (especially by market professionals) but then this book is not aimed at a dry academic market, but rather the general public interested in finance and the sub-prime crises. I enjoyed the book, but I'm still searching for the definitive account of the sub-prime debacle.

B000007O9L|5.0|Having been an institution since the better part of the 1970's, who could have predicted that this would stand by and far as the Stones' most valuable live document? They take some worthy risks here (e.g. \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\") and they dig out a number of excellent obscurities.<br /><br />Now they don't improve (or make worse) \\"Angie\\". But the stupidly overlooked \\"Let It Bleed\\" still sounds fine. They magnificently revamp \\"Not Fade Away\\" into a shuffle that's more akin to the Buddy Holly original, but with just enough of that Bo Diddley beat. The greatest revelation of all, however, is the unearthing of one of Mick and Keith's best, \\"The Spider and The Fly\\". They manage to redefine this 1965 nugget by combining blues guitars and piano against the backdrop of a jazzy rhythm. Jagger's understated vocal and slight lyrical alteration serve this cut perfectly. A stone-cold classic like a miracle out of nowhere.<br /><br />The three rehearsal pieces that conclude this CD are essential too. This may be my favorite version of \\"Love In Vain\\" ever. I never tire of my beloved \\"Sweet Virginia\\" performed with equal gusto as the \\"Exile\\" classic. And they show what they're all about on Willie Dixon's \\"Little Baby\\".<br /><br />Celebrate as Mick lets his hair down, reaches for his harmonica and sings looser than ever. Pinch yourself in listening to Keith and Ronnie ground the music in authenticity by playing the roles of the elder bluesmen they always envisioned themselves to be. And marvel at the way that Charlie lays down his jazz groove like never before.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|God Bless John Lasseter  and Disney for labouring to bring Miyasaki movies to the english language!    The english versions of Whisper of the Heart, Kiki, Totoro, and all the rest are superb - real works of art in themselves. Magnificent!    But the english production of PONYO is trash!  What a catastrophe!    What went wrong here ?!    Let's set aside the fact that the kid actors are approximately 250 years too old for the parts they are playing.    I think the primary problem is that the screenwriters in english went wrong:    The script in English actually tries to explain - believe it - fairy tale mechanisms.    So, imagine you're watching Snow White...    She takes a bite of the apple, and one of the characters says \\"Ah hah, Because of the GENETIC POISON and the dwarf's TIME CONTROL DEVICE, that's why she will GO TO SLEEP...\\"  Ridiculous!    Of course, newsflash, FAIRY TALES DON'T MAKE SENSE. \\"Crazy\\" things happen in fairy tales, just like in dreams. Pigs build houses of straw, cows jump over the moon, kisses change frogs .. it's a fairy tale.    I feel that this explains the fundamental problem with the english version of Ponyo.  The screenwriters in english rather bizarrely try to \\"explain\\" a (totally phantasmagorical) fairy tale.    The movie is PRETTY HORRIBLE in english.    It's reminds me of ... those very awkward \\"orchestral versions\\" of Beatles songs - just doesn't work.    The french version works great, as does the japanese version.    Also, perhaps because the movie is operatic, a stunning interplay of sound-visuals, it just doesnt work unless the voices \\"fit\\" really well.    It's a catastrophe!  We've been watching the french and japanese versions for months (they were released earlier) and the english version is very sad!    Most of the people who watch this film will be two years old - consider just flipping it to the french or japanese track when playing the movie for your two year old! The pacing, feel, everything is then flawless.    As for themovie itself - everything that can be said has already been said.  Miyasaki is a visual and conceptual genius on the level of Michelangelo or Homer.  The film is one of the most important works of visual art - ever.   It is \\"the end\\" of animation, nothing can surpass it - as everyone now knows the film was produced completely manually, on paper and celluloid - just like a movie in the 1960s, no computers at all. It's difficult to believe you are looking at 180,000 individual stunning drawings, each one a masterwork in itself.  The \\"feel\\" of \\"water\\" in the movie has never been found in any other art or depiction of water. The \\"epic\\" scenes of Ponyo on the waves and so on are now instantly formed in to human civilisation like the statue of David or the cave paintings in Lascaux.  Blah, blah, blah, it's an unlimited masterpiece - there is no doubt!    But, what the heck went wrong with the english screenwriting!  Bummer!    My prediction: within 20 years, someone will produce a different english-language version of Ponyo (phew!)    Regarding the Blu-Ray, the production technically is simply as good as it can get, the work of the world's greatest technical geniuses obviously.  The miracle of BluRay.     A note for the many overseas buyers who are having the english-language version shipped to them.  Don't bother, it's trash, just get the french or japanese version - just joking!  Technical tip - if you have trouble or if it is slow launching the disk in English, launch it in French and simply then change to english-soundtrack.  With the endless combinations of firmware versions, etc etc, this may be necessary and fixes your problem.    The \\"new generation\\" (6th gen?) of blu-ray players just released, eg the LG 350 model (which is all of 100 bucks) plays the disk stunningly and loads fast...as my children say \\"it's not a dream, it's bluray...\\"
0812979656|2.0|The God of Small Things was the 1997 Booker Prize winner.      There are definitely some good things about it.  I think the writing style was interesting.  Roy's turn of phrase is poetic and authentic.  The story is straightforward and it is very accessible.  I read this book quickly and did not find it to be unenjoyable.  I found it mildly pleasant.    The core event of the novel, which is revealed very early on, is the death of a child who is visiting India from England.  The ending is revealed early and then the book alternates between events leading up to the death and events following the death.  It is a very deliberately structured book.  The prelude pieces and the aftermath pieces all center very directly around the death of the child.    Unfortunately, I don't think the event itself sustains the length of the book.  Perhaps this could have made a good novel of about 2/3 of the length of this one.  I think it needed more of a driving force.  I was weary by the end of the book and it moved from mildly pleasant to somewhat tiresome.    I found the characters to be quaint and a bit contrived and this also detracted from my interest.    I don't recommend The God of Small Things even though it has some positive attributes.

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|This movie really hit me 25 plus years after my \\"500 Days of Summer\\".  The Graduate (which this film has nice clear scene from) was my template for persevering in a relationship when you could not gain traction anywhere else when figuring out who you were when society deemed you an adult.  Benjamin going against the establishment and pursuing Elaine against all odds and finally winning her love was how I viewed romance.<br /><br />500 Days of Summer shows how that determination gets shattered when hitting the stonewall of someone like Summer.  And then when Tommy picks up the pieces, the cruel irony of Summer being inspired by his determination and belief in love.  The flash of the wedding ring followed by the expression on Tommy's face made me remember the time years ago I wanted to scream \\"Why was it not me!\\" when I saw a similar ring flash.  Pay attention to the initial dedication in the movie, the reflections of this relationship condense to that raw feeling years later.<br /><br />This movie will definitely go into my view every few years pile.  The Graduate is in that pile already and apparently I need a Blu-ray version of that after seeing how clear the clip was in this movie.<br /><br />I did see some one star reviews on this movie because the Blu-ray edition would not play.  My Blu-ray copy would not play either.  It would get to the opening menu and I could not move the selector around on the screen.  I then restarted the disc and noticed that it gave a warning about updating your firmware since this the latest edition of Blu-ray formatting.  I hooked my player up to the internet via network cable and sure enough there was a firmware update available.  After about 10 minutes of updating, the movie played perfectly and all features were available for selection.<br /><br />I also like the full digital version packaged on another disc.  The disc allows the movie to be downloaded into iTunes and I enjoyed watching sections of the movie on my iTouch while commuting.

B000JML7EC|4.0|This was my first time around with \\"Treasure Island\\" and I must say it was a well written novel with plenty of action, plot, suspense, and thrill!  Long John Silver was a well developed character and really defines the moral struggles of mankind.  The outright greed at first and then the ultimate fate he was to endure at the end of the story (no spoilers) was written in a way that I could identify with.  Jim was such a strong and courageous character that doesn't seem to avoid confrontation that he keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire book.  A few times during the thick of the plot, I actually gasped aloud thinking it may be the end!  Altogether, this was a very good and easy read.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic sea/pirate/adventure novel and with the lack of foul language it is deemed appropriate for all ages.

1439190275|1.0|While it's common knowledge there are good carbs and bad carbs unfortunately most people still don't know the difference.  They are also very unaware of the functionality of a carbohydrate in general.  I read the \\"China Study\\" which is the most comprehensive population study on diet that has ever been conducted.   I read \\"The New Atkins\\" expecting it to shed new insight on the whole no/low carb madness backed by facts and studies much like that in the China Project.  I was sorely disappointed by not only a lack of scientific fortitude but an overall feeling of what I like to call \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" science quotes.  Poorly constructed studies looking at less than optimal conditions, often borrowing conclusions from one another.  If you'd like to truly impact your physiology in a positive, long term manor then pick up a copy of \\"The China Study\\".  One word of caution: after reading it your expectation levels will significantly rise but you'll be able to filter out good science vs. bad.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|In honesty, I loved the film \\"Once\\", but the soundtrack itself overall left me a little...ambivalent.  I adored a couple of the songs from the film, but others were less compelling.  Subsequent tracks put out by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova under the band name \\"The Swell Season\\" were equally touch-and-go for me.  There was obvious talent and emotion, but only a few of their songs really resonated with me, or somehow, the arrangements seemed to fall short of the musicians' talents.  However, when I heard a preview of the upcoming \\"Strict Joy\\", I was absolutely captivated from the start.  There is a maturity and professionalism that has come to touch upon The Swell Season on this album, which I find both compelling, soothing and with each progressive listen, more addictive.  The album as a whole has grown on me, like a familiar pair of soft, old, comfortable shoes.  The nuances in production value as well as mostly subtle tempo changes from song to song are endearing, pleasant, easy on the ears, nicely put next to each other.  But the songwriting itself is the real treasure, here.  The raw, unabashed truthfulness in each track wreaks of frailty, longing, failure, tenderness, and even through heartbreak, ultimate joy.  Not that it should matter, but Hansard's and Irglova's well publicized romance and subsequent breakup (despite their admirable staying together in a professional partnership) makes each song all the more powerful, raw and almost uncomfortable in their intimacy, offering a voyeuristic view into the very private details and unraveling of their romance.  But in truth, there is power.  The truthfulness and sensitivity of this album really strikes a chord, offering a glimpse of real struggle, despair and ultimately, growth.  Although there are no clunkers on this album, the tracks that struck me from the start were \\"Low Rising\\", \\"In these Arms\\", \\"High Horses\\" and \\"I Have Loved You Wrong\\".    This album is beautiful, raw, emotive and so far, my favorite for all of 2009.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I have laughed so much, that each time I see this movie I find something else to laugh about. Alan Alda and Ellen Burystn are so perfect for these roles, I cannot image anyone else in those parts. All the little things that made the movie, his watch that was an hour and 25 minutes ahead and that she was supposed to be at a retreat.  When she went into labor and he had labor pains also, it just goes on and on. Just a wonderfully funny movie that I never tire of watching.  I recommend it to all my friends.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|If you've seen a Miyazaki film before, you already know what kind of experience you're in for. Miyazaki's movies are some of the most imaginative, clever works you will ever witness. Ponyo is targeted for a younger audience, but it's still really enjoyable for adults.   In most Japanese to English movies, I almost always prefer the Japanese voice acting. In Ponyo, I like the English voice acting a lot more. This shouldn't really come as much of a surprise with some of the big names in this movie.
B00275EGWY|4.0|I really wanted to like this movie. And I did.  The performances were strong, the direction was decent, the script had some kinks but overall it worked for me.<br /><br />Now there will be a lot of Vets who will destroy this movie over technical stuff or just unbelievable plot turns.  I could even add my own: you don't key a radio next to a bomb.  Never.  When the bomb tech holds his radio up to the unfortunate Iraqi forced to wear a suicide vest, I cringed.  You don't do that.  No cell phones or radios.  Ever.  \\"You're 10-2.\\"  Ka Boom.<br /><br />But it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.  And any movie that tries to show what our soldiers are going through is always a good thing (unless, of course, it's JARHEAD, which I didn't see but read the blistering review in the New York Post by a furious Iraqi Veteran).<br /><br />It takes a while but the characters start to emerge and you like the three guys the film focuses on.  Especially the \\"wild man\\" who discovers the one thing in life he loves.  Excellent actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce make appearances.  And some sequences are very well edited for maximum suspense.<br /><br />Another thing that hurt this film: Hollywood politics.  Kathryn Bigelow, the director, beat her ex-husband James Cameron (AVATAR) for Best Director. I knew that was going to happen.  In a business where powerful men (like Cameron) who dump wives for younger women (like Cameron) deserve to have their comeuppance, Hollywood-style.  That dynamic, I believe, diminishes Bigelow's win.  Sadly.  Yes, it was about time a woman was honored for Best Director, but Hollywood's zeal for drama and their taste for revenge sullied her win.  It will always be there.<br />I'm not saying she didn't deserve it...I just wish it had been under different circumstances.<br /><br />So I liked the cast, loved some sequences.  I will appreciate any film where our boys are heroes.  So check it out.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|After two decades of releasing the kind of music that is prone to attract college-aged males, REM finds themselves making music under a new record label and Accelerate is their latest implementation unto a record-sales anomaly. As R.E.M. started to record under the new label, their music has been faster paced, more tongue and cheek and more focused on the instrumental advances that their music is able to achieve.  Since the departure of R.E.M.'s percussionist(multi-instrumentalist), Bill Berry, the band was not able to regain their original popularity or power.  Accelerate shows that R.E.M. is ready to show the world that it is going to make records that still break boundaries, for years to come. Being that this record was recorded within a smaller amount of time that the band has ever finished a piece of work in; one might have expected less of an album. Accelerate was that of genius and having been recorded in Dublin, Ireland, as well as their hometown in Georgia, one only needs to listen to one song from this album and they will fall in love with such a masterpiece.

0743289692|5.0|The first half of this autobiography tells of Ali's early life in the Muslim world.  Born in Somalia, she also lived in Saudi Arabia and Kenya.  Though Kenya is by far the best of them, all three were depressing places for anyone to live.  Women are profoundly oppressed, and given few life chances.  Seeing the contrast between the Christian and Muslim communities in Kenya, Ali slowly comes to believe that Islam and not \\"culture\\" is the core of the problem.<br /><br />When forced into a marriage she doesn't want, she manages to jump ship in Germany and seek asylum in the Netherlands.  Ali is stunned to see how well these countries work, in matters both big and small.  She works for a while as a translator, goes to university, and then works for a  Social Democratic think tank.  There she manages to stir up controversy when she blames Islam for the plight of Muslims, and warns that Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands threatens that country's success.<br /><br />That view brings her death threats, which probably continue to this day.  Ironically, those threats, and the murder of her associate Theo van Gogh, provide additional evidence that she is right about (significant parts of) Islam.  The storms around Ali, van Gogh, the assassinated Pim Fortuyn, and populist politician Geert Wilders have led to a dramatic change in the political scene of what used to be a politically boring little country.<br /><br />Ali writes simply but forcefully, and her message is important whether you agree or not.
B0000044J0|5.0|Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier is superbly rendered by Enrica Cavallo. These disks were recorded in 1994-95 in Genoa, Italy, and the room in which the music was recorded gives a delightful, sparkling reverb to Calvallo's piano. Calvallo's tempos throughout are perfect. Her playing is smooth and entirely without any kind of artifice or monkeying around. This is an artist fully in control of her medium, very skillful, and with an assured vision, faithful to the music. I count myself lucky to have come across this recording - this woman was a great pianist. Highly recommended!
B00337KMAA|3.0|I just received this dvd and was looking forward to watching it.  Actually I had just ordered 5 blu-ray discs from Amazon.  Imagine my surprise when none of them would play in my blu-ray player.  There was a disclaimer with the disc that it was recorded in the highest possible fashion and might not be rendered as well in an older player (mine is 2 years old), but nothing to the fact that it would NOT play at all.  Also, the trouble web site displayed is nonexistent.  Although this is not Amazon's fault, I wanted to warn other blu-ray buyers.  I think this is a lousy way for Sony to treat customers who have previously bought blu-ray products.  I've been a Sony purchaser for over 30 years, but they just lost a consumer.
0451228731|1.0|The only reason I don't regret wasting my time reading \\"Daemon\\" is because I read it while serving a jury duty summons.  It is marginally more entertaining than solving a jigsaw puzzle or watching (a very fat) Drew Carey host the new \\"The Price is Right\\" with the other poor slobs in the jury pool.    Daniel Suarez appears keen to establish himself as the Dan Brown of high tech: his characters are one-dimensional and easily forgotten, his story is more dazzle than thrill.  But Dan Brown at least knows how to finish a book.  The end of \\"Daemon\\" is just a bridge to the next book in the series (\\"Freedom\\"); there is no climax, no resolution, just a character resurrected from death some 200 pages after his execution following a virtual blue line over the distant horizon.    Maybe I'll read \\"Freedom\\" if I'm summoned for jury duty service again.  Otherwise, I'm not missing anything, and you're not missing anything, either, if you skip this book.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I listen to Audio CDs on my netbook with a disc drive attached while riding the Public Transportation bus to and from work and needed some extra volume to hear comfortably over the noise of the diesel bus and occupants.

I can charge it at home on at work.  It is a great device for my needs and not expensive.
B001FB55L2|5.0|It takes extraordinary courage to place a film like BROTHERS before the public, and it is to the credit of director Jim Sheridan that this superb study of the effects of war on everyone around the globe is so fine.  Based on Suzanne Bier's Danish film 'Brødre' concerning the same timeframe in the Afghanistan war, this screenplay was successfully adapted by David Benioff from Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish screenplay. It is delivered in somewhat choppy format, throwing the audience one minute in the US and the next in Afghanistan, and while it does take getting used to, this choice of storytelling ultimately works splendidly, heightening the tension in a very steady unrelenting way.<br /><br />The Cahill family consists of alcoholic, Vietnam Vet father Hank (Sam Shepard), stepmother Elsie (Mare Winningham) and two brothers - 'perfect' athlete and successful USCM Captain Sam (Tobey Maguire) and the recently released from prison 'worthless' Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam is departing for Afghanistan, leaving his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two daughters Isabelle and Maggie (child actress par excellence Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare).  Sam entrusts a farewell letter to his best friend Major Cavazos (Clifton Collins Jr.) in case he doesn't return.  Sam is off to war and is very soon shot down and taken prisoner by the Afghanis: the report sent home is that Sam has been killed in action. Sam and Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) are starved, beaten, and abused as prisoners until at one hideous moment Sam is instructed to kill the doomed Joe - an act he carries out and absorbs all the subsequent anguish and guilt that results from his act of survival.<br /><br />At home Grace and Tommy become close: the girls love Tommy, Tommy works on Grace's house, and when the report of Sam's death reaches them they are bonded even more tightly - despite Hank's hateful attitude toward the 'failure' Tommy. But when word reaches them that Sam is alive and when Sam returns home, the trials begin.  Sam is wasted physically and emotionally, forever devastated by his war experience and his guilt.  The story form here on must be seen to understand just how bitterly cruel the aftermath of war can be.<br /><br />This is truly an ensemble movie with every character perfectly cast and giving memorable performances.  Few will be able to erase the images that Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman create - and hopefully those bleak images will force some reality testing on the ongoing question of the 'worth' of war.  A brilliant film.  Grady Harp, March 10Sam is wasted physically and emotionally, forever devastated by his war experience and his guilt.

Delayed viewing the film for several weeks -- but what a surprise when I did slip that DVD into the player. Probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time dealing sensitively with the subject of death (sending off) and reinforcing the value and appreciation of life. The other movie I so loved was the French movie, titled, Ponette (1997 I believe) that dealt with death from a child's perspective. Although a difficult topic -- this is not \\"a downer\\" and will send you on a whirlwind of emotions from moments that justify sobbing to outright laughter.

It took a month to get and when I did I went trough the book playing most of the songs I already know, the chords seemed off.  The author does warn you of this saying the Beatles sometimes play tune down a semitone or below concert pitch and if you want to play along with the record tune your guitar  higher. It would have been nice to know where/which songs to do that.    The format of the book is for reading only.  You will find yourself using 10 lb weights to hold the book open while you try to play along. Beginners stay away.

In the book, it provides research data on why we should eat plant-based diet. Dr. Campbell himself is the first beneficiary of his own research. Initially, he was a meat eater, after the research completed, he changed his diet. It's not like other books which is based on biased research (e.g. supported by meat/diary industry, so their data will try to convince people the benefits of meat/diary consumption) For you health, you should read it.

B001B51B9M|5.0|I actually bought this because my wife loves musicals and this one especially. I'm not a huge fan of them, and only watched it to make her happy. In the end, though, I wound up watching the entire movie and will watch it many times more, not because of its inherent charm (which it does have in plenty; can you say young Ron Howard faking a lisp?), but because of it's amazing picture quality (PQ) and sound.    I didn't know this film looked this good. The large scale dance scenes are marvelous because of the colorful costumes and sets and the non-stop action, all captured beautifully in 1080P with extraordinary detail. The recorded sound has a great depth and punch to it. The barbershop quartet scenes will make you crank your home theater system out of sheer enjoyment. This transfer competes with the quality of the 2001: A Space Odyssey transfer that I consider a high mark. I'm not fascinated by special features and so I haven't really evaluated the ones available on this disc, but it doesn't seem lacking for those folks who really enjoy these features; especially when you consider the age of most material associated with this film.    Summary:  -Surprisingly *EXCELLENT* PQ  -Excellent audio  -Reasonable price, especially if you or someone you love loves this film as much as my wife

0767817486|2.0|I can't understand how so many people think this is such a great movie.<br />When I first saw it, having read & enjoyed the book [[ASIN:0445043024 Midnight Express]], I waited for the incredibly exciting escape, and then went \\"Huh??\\" A really thrilling escape story was completely cheapened by the totally bogus ending of this film. Perhaps I'd have liked the film more without reading the book. Some books can be improved when turned into films, such as [[ASIN:2290038164 Forest Gump]] or [[ASIN:0345408926 For Love of the Game]], while some, such as [[ASIN:B003JTHSQ8 Q & A: A Novel]](upon which \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" was very loosely based) really suffer when they reach the silver screen.

0307454541|1.0|Stieg Larsson, the author of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" has an unhealthy fascination with violent, sadistic sex in its most depraved forms.  Larsson fabricates a paper-thin plot peopled with characters as lifeless as the Swedish winter as an excuse to subject the reader to his horrific fantasies.  And they are horrific: forced incest, torture in every conceivable form, sexual brutalization, and murder. This is violent pornography masquerading as a murder mystery.<br /><br />In a pathetic (and offensive) attempt to justify his obsession, Larsson begins each section of the book with a statistic on violence against Swedish women.  Yet the zeal with which Larsson describes sexual horrors reads more like a celebration of these gruesome deeds than a condemnation.  The impression is heightened by Larsson's inability to infuse his female characters with any life, depth or compassion.  They are uniformly uninteresting and one-dimensional and all, regardless of age, share the common trait of immediately offering themselves sexually to the story's main character, a fifty-something failed journalist. The twenty-something girl after whom the book takes its title (and who, of course, also jumps into the journalist's bed) moves through the story in a catatonic state, except when she explodes into a violent rage.<br /><br />Larsson devotes hundreds of pages to an unbearably tedious exposition that develops several wandering plot lines.  Several of the subplots are dropped by the end of the book, leaving the reader to wonder whether the author simply lost interest or forgot that he had started them.  Either way, the reader is the beneficiary, since none of the plot lines are remotely interesting or believable.<br /><br />The \\"mystery,\\" such as it is, consists of the disappearance of a young girl decades before the story takes place.  The events surrounding the disappearance are simply not believable, and the subsequent \\"investigation\\" by the failed journalist is utterly lacking in credibility or interest.  Although the book is peopled with a variety of characters from all walks of life, they all plod like zombies through Larsson's dense and poorly written scenes. The plot lines are so simplistic and predictable that the solution to the \\"mystery\\" becomes self-evident well before the brutal end of this endless story.<br /><br />The unfortunate conclusion is that Larsson has created this excrutiatingly boring tale solely to serve as the backdrop for his obsession with the violent subjugation of women.  This impression is only strengthened by the publisher's unfortunate choice to include the first few pages of the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" which opens with --- guess what --- a 13-year old girl bound hand and foot to a bed, held sexual prisoner by a much older man. This window into Mr. Larsson's soul would have better been left closed and tightly shuttered.nterest.  Although the book is peopled with a variety of characters from all walks of life, they all plod like zombies through Larsson's dense and poorly written scenes. The plot lines are so simplistic and predictable that the solution to the \\"mystery\\" becomes self-evident well before the brutal end of this endless story.     The unfortunate conclusion is that Larsson has created this excrutiatingly boring tale solely to serve as the backdrop for his obsession with the violent subjugation of women.  This impression is only strengthened by the publisher's unfortunate choice to include the first few pages of the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" which opens with --- guess what --- a 13-year old girl bound hand and foot to a bed, held sexual prisoner by a much older man. This window into Mr. Larsson's soul would have better been left closed and tightly shuttered.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Let me start by saying I have seen almost every horror film you can name, and probably some you can't. This film will stick in your mind long after you've finished watching it. Unlike Hostel or Saw, this film is a hundred times more cerebral, unpredictable, and willing to push the envelope in a way most American films will not. There are no punches pulled. There are no heroes. There are only human monsters.  Horror lovers, I strongly recommend you do not read anything about this picture before watching it, which will ruin its power to scare. You will be entertained. You will think about it after it's over. I promise.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|This is a horrible film. It is slow and boring for the first 50 minutes. Then it began to show how a 9 year old child could brutally kill a nun! It continued with all destructive behavior, not just mildly destructive but to the extreme! Now we wonder how why our children have respect issues--- maybe it is because it is becoming socially acceptable.  This movie had no content or reason to be made and is not worth the purchase price.
B001QOGYBI|3.0|So you take big stars for the voice over but then they use crappy stop motion techniques for the animation. What you end up with is a product that is good<br />but could have been better.<br />What bothers me is that they still charge you a arm and a leg anyway.<br />Good movie, rent it  ...and if you like it buy it second hand...so you wont feel<br />ripped off.<br /><br /> The story is good but not too complex. Its like watching one of those family<br />episodes on TV where they deal with different issues...but done with animals instead<br />of humans.
0316044695|4.0|Very good look inside the mind of a Navy SEAL and the rigors of today's battlefield.  It will make you thankful men like Luttrell are out there protecting us.
0307463745|5.0|Though not a new business bible, this is a great resource for small teams trying to solve big problems. Working as a part of one such small team for the last five years, there's a lot here we do, there's a lot we should do, and there's a lot we would never do.

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie! I'm writing from the standpoint of a young adult, African American man(since some people think it's offensive to blacks). The colors were vibrant and the animation is so very familiar of how Disney used in their classic animated films. I'm very happy Disney did something different than the typical Broadway type of song. Great jazz feel to the whole thing with the colors, accents, dialogue etc. It seems Disney did a lot of research on Louisiana culture before doing this movie, which made it incredibly believable.<br /><br />To some, the voodoo aspect may be \\"too dark\\" for kids. However, not everyone grows up the same. Voodoo is a part of Louisiana culture, and maybe the kids in that area grow up learning about it. All in all, great movie for EVERYONE and gives people an open and none judgmental feel of how others grow up/perceive the world
1423101499|5.0|This is another great entry in the Olympians series by Rick Riordin.  He has a talent for capturing his ready from the very beginning and holding them enthralled through to the last word on the last page.  This is an all around great story and I can't wait to share it with my children.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|4.5*s.    Riveting from start to finish, and humourous too.     No cheesy Hollywood hero. The main character is an anti-hero. You hate him to begin with and he deserves his fate at the end.    Very original and one I'd watch again.    Only downside is the flaw with operation of the weapons. Why could the aliens not operate them? Only one person could. An explanation would have been nice.    Notice the least-helpful reviews give it 1* .. just an observation.
1557048630|5.0|If you are big fan of the film, then you have to get this book. It includes beautiful art and design from the movie. Want to know more about Berk, get this book!!!
B00288KNL8|5.0|My 6-year-old daughter and I saw this for the first time on HBO. I frankly would not have expected her to love this film as much as she does. I would have thought it too dark, weird and spooky for her, and I still think if she'd seen it for the first time on the big screen it would have frightened her. But now, she wants to watch it practically every day. Go figure. Most of her 1st-grade classmates thought it was too scary. I think it helped that we saw a \\"making of\\" featurette before we saw the film, so she was prepared for the dark turns of the plot as well as reminded that everything was animated from puppets.    But if your child can handle this film, it's a true masterpiece. The artistry is amazing -- I believe the scene where Coraline first encounters the other-worldly garden belongs in the recordbooks as one of the greatest animated sequences ever. The voice talent is flawless; I wouldn't have thought to cast Dakota Fanning as Coraline, but she ends up fitting perfectly.    I especially like the messages this film gets across. Some reviewers have taken away negative \\"messages\\" that, frankly, make no sense from someone who's actually seen the film. For me, in addition to the \\"careful what you wish for\\" tagline, the film demonstrates for kids that 1) having real parents who love you is more important than getting constant attention 24/7, 2) if something looks too good to be true it probably is, and 3) escapism can be fun but hiding from the real world is dangerous. It's this anti-escapism message that I find to be particularly valuable, as well as extremely rare in any Hollywood film, let alone a children's film.    Now if only the Coraline dolls weren't so ridiculously expensive and difficult to find. Of all the throwaway films that get merchandised to death, it's a shame no major toy company picked up the license for this film.
B00247RVGS|5.0|It was a really good movie. Now I know why it won so many Oscard rewards. The DVD was cheap and good. I loved it!
0312360266|4.0|This book took me a while to really get into. In fact, i may have even pushed it aside to start somethign else had I not already bought teh first and second book in the series. I'm glad I kept reading though. About half way through is when you really start to wonder how and when you'll put it down. I think some of the language and sexual innuedos are unnecesary but not so much that it completely takes focus from the story. Good one sitting read and I immediately picked up the second book 'Betrayed\\" the moment I was done with the first.
1591843162|4.0|I like Seth Godin, and this is one of his better books.  The first half of the book is brilliant - very insightful, smart and well written.    The second half of the book is slightly more episodic.  It feels like a series of blog posts that are not as connected as the first part of the book.    In any case, it really got me thinking: what is my contribution to my job?  To my career?  Am I a linchpin or a drone?  Or somewhere in between?    I'd buy it again, and in fact, have given it to some of my direct reports for inspiration.
B002VECMAE|1.0|This one did  nothing for me.  Well, that's not true, it did temporarily break  insomnia's hold on me.  A solid cast but a weak story.  Should be Zero stars.
7799623519|3.0|I think most people looking to buy this product already know The Wall is a masterpiece, and know it is a story of a boy named (or nicknamed) Pink, his childhood, his rise to fame as a rockstar, and ultimately his fall from grace as a result of a nervous breakdown and drug addiction.  For more complete reviews, see the original release of this CD which contains over 1000 reviews.    Unfortunately, this Chinese release of The Wall is missing the song Young Lust.  Upon receiving this CD, I was saddened to realized this fact and The Wall as a whole seemed incomplete.  If you are someone who has never listened to The Wall, I would still have to recommend one of the other versions - one of the complete versions with all 26 songs.    If you are a collector who enjoys different versions of The Wall, then perhaps this has a place in your collection.  Otherwise, I would skip it.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Wasn't ready for this flick to be this good.  A pleasant surprise.  Everyone's been pretty clear on the storyline.  I do wonder however, whatever happened to Michael's brother?  He was introduced, the mother said we'd like to meet him someday, and that's all, folks.  Just seemed a bit odd.
B00338QENI|5.0|A MUST READ!!!  What a profound story.  My first thought was...I am a 40 year old college graduate & I've never heard of Henrietta Lacks and her contribution to Science, not to mention her contribution to American History! There's no mention of Henrietta in my kids school textbooks which is such a shame because this story needs to be told.  Mrs. Lacks is the foundation of Science as we know it today!  Bravo to Rebecca for telling the story and to the Lacks Family for enduring!!
0765356147|5.0|While book one was perhaps a bit slow in its plot development, this third installment in Sanderson's Mistborn series is fast paced, intriguing, and does a nice job of wrapping the intentionally confused plot he left us with at the end of the second book.  Here we get a clear picture of the world that the Lord Ruler (or Sanderson...take your pick) has created and how all the disparate elements are intertwined and to what purpose.<br /><br />Sanderson continues to draw his readers in by featuring different characters in his \\"starring\\" roles (Spook, notably).  This keeps the series fresh.  Three books about the growth of a character can be a bit much; in altering his major players, Sanderson injects new life into the plot.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fine ending to the Mistborn series.  The plot was resolved in a satisfying way and I look forward to more from this author (including his finishing of Jordan's Wheel of Time series!).
0385341008|5.0|This book arrived quickly, which was great because I had no time to shop.  It's a very satisfying story.  I recommend it.
0393072231|4.0|I read \\"Liar's Poker\\" and loved it so of course I wanted to get this one too. I've read a couple of other books about the fascinating spiral our country has gone through since Spring 2008. But \\"The Big Short\\" captures important background you can't get by following the Bernake, Paulson, Geithner's around. \\"The Big Short\\" is about the few who swam against the flow and like \\"Liar's Poker\\" it follows smaller fish, which makes it more realistic to those of us working in Banking/Mortgage for the past 20 years. There are no heroes in this story, only those who saw a huge opening and exploited it.<br /><br />Liar's Poker's most memorable quote for me was \\"ripping faces off\\"; for The Big Short my favorite was \\"F-you, I'm short your house!\\" I thoroughly enjoyed all the players in the book, Burry, Vinny, etc. but by far my favorite is Eisman. I believe a bit of hyperbole was used by Lewis on this character, but Eisman is so brash and so over-the-top crazy that he jumps off the pages at the reader. To me, he is pure capitalism. I think if the SEC or Fed had one guy like him on-staff, things may have turned out different.<br /><br />Also, Lewis does a great job of spreading blame all around - SEC, Fed, Moody's/S&P/Fitch, repeal of Glass-Stegal, etc. But I wish he had gone into OFHEO and HUD more - those guys were totally asleep at the wheel!  And the Fed? What happened to their predatory lending department? Staffed with monkeys? What's clear to me is that there was fraud here, so why has no one been prosecuted? So many people looked the other way its a miracle it didn't all fall apart sooner. Everyone was complicit in the mess.<br /><br />I would have preferred Lewis went into more play-by-play starting spring 2008 and bring the reader through the sheer terror of fall/winter 2008/early 2009. Those were the days when sane, educated people were buying guns and stuffing mattresses! It was scary and might help more folks understand Bernake/Paulson's actions by bailing out AIG, etc. I'm not sure the general public realizes how close our country came to the abyss.general public realizes how close our country came to the abyss.
B00328G4V6|3.0|The other day I stood in a record store and listened as they played the new Hendrix release.<br /><br />I paid special attention to the title track. There are two main impressions I got from it.<br /><br />The first is that it is unfinished. If Hendrix lived long enough to release it, and chose to do so,the song would not sound like it does. Consider the period it was done: 1969. The influence of &#34;Axis: Bold as Love&#34; was still strong in his music. &#34;Axis&#34; was an important work in that Hendrix mastered the art of using the recording studio itself as a musical instrument. With &#34;Valleys&#34; he'd laid down a foundation; like a background in a painting. What was needed was the subject. The lyrics / singing formed only a part of this. What was needed were the melodic ornaments, the sonic arabesques Hendrix was so brilliant at. A good example would be &#34;Castles Made of Sand&#34; from &#34;Axis&#34;. We have the rhythmic foundation (listen to the bass drum part: pure hip hop!), the lyrics / poetry, and then the guitar parts weaving in and around the other elements of the song. This later is what's missing from &#34;Valleys&#34; - and as it stands now, nobody can finish it. The only man capable of doing so is gone forever.<br /><br />The second is the lyric. The first two verses are pure psychedelia. It may be interesting to dissect whatever symbolism can be cross referenced with arcane systems of knowledge. But as the song progresses, Hendrix starts speaking about what may be described as near-prophetic visions. Massive changes in the earth and in human society that are troublesome. What is really fascinating is that now, almost 40 years after Hendrix' death, these things are starting to happen in the world. It's rather like in another track from &#34;Axis&#34;: &#34;Up From the Skies.&#34; In that song, he spoke of being here &#34;before the days of ice&#34; - the ice age? - and returning to &#34;find the stars misplaced and the smell of a world that had burned. Well maybe it's just a change of climate.&#34; And of course, now this is happening in the world. Could it be Hendrix was &#34;tuned in&#34; to something?<br /><br />The saddest part of all this, the new releases, contemplation of Hendrix' biography, and the world we live in, is that few realize Hendrix' true historical significance. I often wonder who is / will pick up the gauntlet that Hendrix threw down when he died. Who will continue where he left off. Now, I don't mean the usual assortment of &#34;Jimi Clones.&#34; I mean that all inclusive, transcendental approach to music. Hendrix showed us what could be done - and like the Buddhist admonishment, the finger pointed toward the moon; most people stare at the finger, and all that heavenly glory was missed.<br /><br />The posthumous release &#34;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&#34; was probably among the best that came out. It was produced and engineered by Eddie Kramer; who was there with Hendrix when he recorded the tracks. And much of it was music Hendrix himself had approved. There were some others: Cry of Love and Rainbow Bridge were marvelous. War Heros had a few moments. But most of it is just us picking through the scraps, trying to find hidden gems.<br /><br />Of course, since Hendrix is now an historical figure, analysis of his music is useful. And he should be remembered. But sometimes I wonder if a better way to honor Hendrix would be to cultivate those musicians and artists (and whoever else may have been influenced by him: his impact cannot be confined to music alone) who will pick up where he left off, and take their work to the realms Hendrix pointed us toward. Once that is done, Hendrix may rest peacefully, knowing his life's work made a useful impact on humanity - even more so than we already enjoy.ust a change of climate.&#34; And of course, now this is happening in the world.

B00275EGWY|4.0|I did not find the movie to be all that it was hyped up to be. Although it was still enjoyable to watch. My 2 cents: rent first then, if you wish, pick it up from a discount rack or a bargain bin.
B00006CXSS|3.0|the product itself is excellent.  Was advertised as like BRAND NEW., but when received, the collector tin was dented in one corner, and the cd's were covered in fingerprints.  This was to be a gift, and I was not happy.
0812550706|5.0|The book is easy to read, not filled with fluffy elaborate detail. I prefer this, but the author has received criticism exactly for this.<br /><br />I haven't read fiction in years; I remember not liking to keep up with all the intricacies some authors pride themselves on. So, I enjoyed this book. I took my time with the first half but got really into the last half and finished it up in two days, which says a lot for me.
0545123267|5.0|an overall awesome read! very sweet love story with a great ending. i was a big fan of the twilight series and have been looking for another story that had that same something that was so appealing. totally got it with shiver! looking forward to the next one! :)
B000Y179KO|2.0|Love the classic Eagles. Saw this in a store and thought what the heck. I wish they had a listening booth. Most of the songs are drivel, slow, and boring.... I listened to the album 3 times and only found 1 or 2 songs even enjoyable as a tune. Then when I listened to the lyrics I got even angrier.... I cannot stand liberal propaganda crap, and this album was full of it. Too bad the songs sucked, but what made it worse was the bs politics of Don Henley.... what a shame. This album could have been a LOT better.
1557048630|5.0|Awesome book, great art, tons of design drawings by Nico Marlet so if that is what you are looking for definitely pick this one up.
B00003CX8N|2.0|Spurred on by the reviews here, I tried it. Anne Bancroft acts SO badly in this flick, it's a wonder her mannered accent and in-your-face New Yawker shtick hasn't been roundly panned.
B000001E21|5.0|I have recently listened to most of their material over again and this Is TRULY a GREAT CD!.. You can't always produce a master piece and when you do it somehow is always is expected  from that point on. However, Once in a while everything  seems to fall in place with the least amount of effort + when you least expect it to . Friends this CD is worth IT!. I can see the progression in their music over the years and how they  have tried to replicate  \\"The Past \\" and try some NEW things with a lot of hit and miss and never  WOW'g the fans like in the past. But this is one of their best  \\"solid\\"  album. Cheers! U will Love IT!
B002UXRH10|2.0|OK im going to keep it honest, this album was ok, GGGB was way better. its like, after being beaten she is trying to convince the world that she is so hard, or a gangsta for life. Hard, G4l and another are like the most memorable tracks, the rest is so forgettable. i mean, that incident with chris brown really helped this album out because it really average. i love you rihanna but i have to be honest with you, its not your best. i actually wish i had bought Chris browns instead, because i love that cd. All this fake stuff from rihanna is a turn off...
B00004XMTJ|5.0|It is a beautiful DVD. I have been privileged to see the On-Stage performance in Seattle twice, and nice as that was, this DVD reveals costume and make-up detail that is even better seen. CATS DVD is near the very top of my collection. THANKS... to the creators!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|I could not believe how big this thing is.  When I got the box and pulled this thing out I could not believe it was goign to fit in my computer case.  It does take up a large amount of space and makes working on any other parts hard.      It does a good job of cooling my CPU and is not very loud (depending on the fans you attach to it).  Overall it is a good cooler just be aware of how large it is.
B002OHB3CG|4.0|I have reviewed this group before and nothing has changed, they are still a superior group of musicans and writers. They decided to do a live acoustice set,<br />similar to the old VH1 style. It's very good, reminds me of one of my favorite<br />70's bands Renaissance with Annie Haslam.<br />Would love to have been there, BUT I would love to see them anywhere !!! (in the USA)
B00275EGWY|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, action packed, thought provoking, seeing what our troops have to deal with on a daily basis
B0024F08UG|5.0|The action was directed by Irwin Allen, who is a philosopher, so his interview is interesting. In a sense this is classic adventure directing (45% of film). This is the blueprint for the blockbuster, they were here filming behind the scenes and used 4 film crews, so there is McQueen footage behind the scenes, though there exists no film of McQueen being interviewed. Though a lost interview was found of Bruce Lee, who was the Martial arts instructor for McQueen and Stirling Dale Silliphant - the writer of the film! I guess this makes McQueen the old version of Tom Cruise, who does own one of McQueen's bikes. Perhaps Newman represented a version of Denzel Hayes Washington. Lines were added to Mcqueens script so he had the same number of lines as Newman, and his name is to the left in the main titles, so his name is read first. Who also worked with real life fireman to help the role.    The dts HD MA really sizzles out, and the music is mostly on the front, I prefer this because old films can sound fake when you insert rear effects; the film also has an Academy winning song, and a film sound track by the person who did the Star War's theme next.    It does a mythic quality, which can be a good or a bad thing, though it may be a bad thing in this film, I would have preferred something more realistic, and less wanting.    The twin towers were the tallest building then, but in 1974 it was surpassed by the Sears Tower, is a 108-story building. But the Towering Inferno represents the tallest building in the ideal sense, which connects itself to the Tower of Babel, which was in Iraq, so things have turned. So the themes taken on are adultery (Richard Wagner), lying (Fred Astaire), and greed (Richard Chamberlain).    It may not look big, but it feels big - using space within space.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Wonderful movie that puts music to whimsical imagery. Some of the musical pieces used present a clear story when they are animated and others are more abstract. Having this movie on DVD is a real treat because it brings me back to younger days and I still watch it with the same fascination.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I wasn't sure what I would think about a book that is set from the point of view of the sole survivor of a brutal family killing.  Normally, I tend to not enjoy delving into \\"Dark Places\\", but Gillian Flynn makes this dive much easier, because there's no \\"cheesy\\" cliche situations.  In fact, the heroine doesn't want to be reminded of her past at all.  The interesting thing is that the writer also has journal-like chapters from the point of view of the victims and the accused.  In the end, you barely care about \\"who did it\\", you just want the heroine, Libby Day, to be in a good place.  She's barely lived at all, trying to avoid her past and avoid any connection to the world at all, and through her struggles with the past, that she's forced to deal with, she becomes what anyone of us could be.

It's a little technical and assumes you know at least a little about training, but there is nothing else out there that even comes close!
B001HN694K|5.0|I recently saw the IMAX 3D version of this film. As usual, Johnny Depp performs with amazing magical skill to his part.  What really stuck me, is Burton's visualization of a number of neurological afflctions in his characters.  As a practicing neurosurgeon, it's hard for me to miss these things.  For example, The Mad Hatter has asymmetric pupils and his eyes are incongurent.  These represent at least two cranial nerve defecits.  The original author, Dodgson, or Lewis Carroll as his pen name, may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy or migraine disorder.  His mother, according to the Wikipedia page, died at an early age of meningitis or encephalitis.  Dodgson may have well studied neurologic disorders as a result of his personal experiences.  Tim Burton hit these abnormalities spot on.  Furthermore, did you notice the wierd large skull of the Red Queen?  This is precisely how children suffering from untreated hydrocephalus appear.  I'll have to watch this movie several times to look for more neurologic anomalies.  It definitely adds a new dimension to this wonderful film.  I plan to buy the BluRay version as soon as it comes out.  This film is a classic!
B00362J7LM|5.0|i thought this was awsome. Omg. It was better than watchign it in the theatre.... picture was crisp, sound was incredible and the extras were worth every friggin penny. Definately a must by for big fans of the one and only King of Pop, Michael Jacksonj.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I had a old school LCD monitor arm (converted from model for CRT) which is very heavy duty but somehow like a robot arm in a factory.  This Neo-Flex is totaly different from my previous one and designed for LCD flat panels. Its arm is somewhat more organic and well built. Although someone may concern about the limited vertical move ability, I think it is fine as long as I don't move it verticaly often. (moving in horizontal directions is very easy by the way)   The most impressive part is the joint of the arm. It uses cupper (or something look like the cupper color)washier in between the sandblasted-silver color main parts. I'll feel comfortable to see it in any highly decorated office or even display in art musieums...(not DMV though...lol )    Overall  Pro: great build quality, elegent design, does what I need it for, reasonable price.  Con: limited vertical movement.    I'll recommend this item to my friends!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Hi everyone, just doing my part to explain that Oprah Winfrey's narration could not kiss the sandal straps of David Attenborough's narration.     She over enunciates everything and speaks very matter-of-factedly.  Furthermore, she patronizes the audience, as if they are a bunch of kids hearing a teacher read, \\"See Spot Run.\\"    I'm no Oprah hater, but I don't know how she got this part.    Finally, I hear the footage on the David Attenborough version is more \\"honest,\\" regarding what actually happened to the cute, cuddly animal.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A great mini-series, I highly recommend it!  This is NOT a family show.  Scenes of tarring and feathering and an amputation at sea make it most definitely a show that is inappropriate for kids, but it will bring back everything you learned in history class and more.  Highly recommend you read McCullough's book (that it is based upon) too.

I've heard that the ending of the book makes it worth it - that there is some amazing revelation at the end that ties everything together - but what's the point if you can't get there? I don't recommend this book at all.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|The series is a next step in a trend that emerged in the 1990's, to make Sci-fi: darker, \\"edgier\\", and more violent.  It's unfortunate because the trend ruined stand-outs like \\"Sliders\\" after it's first two seasons.  I didn't dislike like Torchwood, but it seems to offer nothing original nor has any particular strong points; if one takes away the \\"flash\\", there is little left.  As an example - The first show after the opener is very similar to a \\"New Outer Limits\\" show staring Alisa Milano(sp).  She was possessed by an alien that wanted sexual energy; Torchwood just re-presented this theme with more \\"flash\\" different cast and venue.  The \\"Outer Limits\\" version spent more time on character development and plot, the actors were more engaging and it was simply a better (deeper, richer) story (and I'm not that much of a fan of the New Outer Limits).  Torchwood seems geared to \\"entertain\\" a certain demographic, and it's following a formula to do it.  The series is not up to what one would expect from the BBC with respect to story quality and acting.  I may have been somewhat entertained, but it's basically junk food.

B002S0OBN2|2.0|When I first heard Love Never Dies, I was absolutely discussed. I was comparing with the original POTO, which heard hundreds of times. The music in between songs was terrible.     Then after reading so many good reviews I decided to give it another try. Honestly the music grew on me, but because I disconnected myself completely from the original Phantom. I had to, because the continuation Phantom story is very poorly written. I could think of a dozen of stories that could very well flow with the first POTO.     ALW, took a huge risk to make the sequel of his best work. I don't know how he missed so many details, for example in his produced motion picture, Christine dies 40 years later. Its different in LND. It says on her grave stone at the end of the movie, that she lived to be 63. Also the movies ending was so beautifully done, when Raul sees a rose and the diamond ring left by Phantom on Christine's grave.    The music is not as \\"original\\" as Phantom (discounting Pucini).  You can hear some similarities, from Guys and Dulls, Chicago, Aspects of Love and others.     The conclusion, LND should have been a new musical, without any masks or traces of Phantom. 2 stars for his music effort.
0060934913|5.0|I watch Bourdain's \\"No Reservations\\" television show on a regular basis.  His narrations always interest me, they being sadistic, off-color, perverse, and need I add humorous.  His love of classical music that originated at CBGB's in New York only added to my interest.  But the real deal with this \\"cook\\" (read the book and you'll find the meaning of this word) is that he loves and appreciates food and those who prepare it.  His book \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is an informative, amusing, and provocative look at the food industry.  As I read this classic novel, I could hear his voice speaking the words as if I were having a conversation with the chef.  It is an absolutely must-read for the Bourdain fan and anyone else who has found Monty Python's true meaning of life!  A great read from a great gastronomist (Is this a real word?).
0385338910|5.0|I'm a fan of Nick Hornby's work and I was taken in by the paperback's prominent People-provided blurb that states \\"there a touch of Nick Hornby in this winning tale.\\"  Having concluded this very enjoyable book, I agree with that assessment.  Hornby's talent (at least in his first three books) was his eerie ability to get inside the head of man-as-still-adolescent.  Jonathan Tropper does the same thing here.  Having experienced the sudden death of his beloved, eleven-years-older wife, Tropper's protagonist Doug Parker is left in the grief-stricken position of being a twenty-something widower.  Not only is he unsure how to handle it, others in his circle are as well.<br /><br />The book picks up one year after Doug's wife's death.  Doug remains mired in his grief.  Family members are trying - one way or another - to get him to move along.  The next few months of Doug's life - the focus of this book - prove to be very messy indeed.  The book is equal parts grief and comedy.<br /><br />I'm surprised that 'Widower' hasn't been made into a movie.  At many points in the novel, it reads more like a screenplay.  I have to think Tropper wrote the book with a screenplay in mind.  Most notably, I imagine every teenage actor in Hollywood itching to play Doug's 16-year-old stepson, Russ.  Of note, is the scene where Russ (gaining courage from some furtively imbibed drinks) lays his heart on the line for Doug's younger sister, Debbie.  It's a page-long toast that Russ gives at a wedding rehearsal dinner.  It'll be the knockout highlight of the film adaptation.<br /><br />I did do some scratching around and found out via IMDB that there's a related film project 'in development' with a 2011 target date called \\"After Hailey.\\"  I won't count my chickens here though: Tropper signed this deal in 2006 and Scott Frank ([[ASIN:B0035WTJFW Minority Report [Blu-ray]]]) mentions it as his 'next project' in a 2009 article.  It doesn't yet show up in Frank's 2009 IMDB profile.

B002UJIY70|4.0|A PERFECT GETAWAY<br /><br />STARRING: Steve Zahn, Milla Jovovich, Timothy Olyphant, Kiele Sanchez, Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: David Twohy<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: David Twohy<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Thriller<br />Release Date: 07 August 2009<br /><br />Steve Zahn has done it again. The guy is brilliant. Few actors can laugh your socks off, make you cry, and freak you out; Zahn is one of the best at all three and he's only getting better.<br /><br />He stars in A Perfect Getaway as Cliff, a Hollywood screenwriter on his honeymoon with Cydney (Milla Jovovich). The two lovebirds have decided to `get away' for their honeymoon, to Hawaii. Things look promising that they'll have a good time; save for the fact that another couple on their honeymoon was murdered very recently, on a nearby Island. Surely they have nothing to worry about though, because what are the odds the killer would come to their island? To them - not likely; for us as audience members watching a thriller - it's as good as inevitable.<br /><br />So we know the killer will show up at some point, but what we have to do now is figure out who it will be. We are introduced very early on, to a couple of hitchhikers, and when things don't go over so well between the two couples; we have our first suspects. Surely they will pop again sooner or later.<br /><br />Crossing a dangerously slippery waterfall, we meet a guy who could easily be Rambo's long lost brother. The sensational Timothy Olyphant plays Nick, an ex military stud who is, and I'm quoting him and his girlfriend here, \\"Really hard to kill.\\" Nick and his girl Gina have us suspicious but could they really be the killers?<br /><br />Cliff and Cydney aren't exactly sure about them, but they seem to know their way around the island pretty well; and when the hitchhikers show up again, anyone would make better company. So they tag along with Nick and Gina and things get very interesting.<br /><br />There is really no way to describe much more, without ruining the film. It's a fast paced, in your face thriller. It's edgy and full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing. The characters are all beautifully designed and well-acted. Everyone was believable and kept your head spinning in regards to who was really who. The film had a Hitchcock feel to it, but it also had the hype and current look that a film like Scream would bring you.<br /><br />The film is written and directed by David Twohy. Between both trades, he's given us a ton of great films to include Pitch Black and its sequels, Waterworld, The Fugitive, The Arrival and G.I. Jane, to name only a few. His latest film, A Perfect Getaway is exactly that, for any fan of film with 97 minutes to invest. It's the kind of movie you see twice.paced, in your face thriller.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|I can't explain it but I just get filled with so much joy watching this, and all of Miyazaki's films. Ponyo is such a charming movie. Made for children but adults can enjoy it just as much in their own way. For me, just looking at the breathtakingly gorgeous animation is enough. But the story and characters are filled with so much heart and spirit that you can't help but fall in love with them. This ranks up there with my all time favorite Miyazaki film, Spirited Away. I can't wait for his next film.

The characters that placed the bets on the dark side were almost fictional but like they say, you can't make this stuff up! Also, the cocky buffoons who took the long side of the trade were so cocky and condescending (and clueless) that you wanted to see them get blown up with their positions. It just sucked that they took most of the country down with them.<br />Michael broke down the bond derivatives operational machine as best he could for the non-financial person to understand what was going on (turns out most people in the finance industry needed this translation as well).<br />Highly recommend this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of those books, like the Harry Potter series, that adults should read also.  Don't let the category fool you in to missing an excellent book.    Since there have been plenty of reviews of this book already, I will simply touch briefly on the main topic already covered and why you shouldn't care.    On the book being not entirely original.    Yes, this book is reminiscent of \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", \\"The Lottery\\", \\"The Long Walk\\", and \\"The Running Man\\".  It doesn't matter.  The take is unique enough and the add-ons original enough that you find yourself not caring, even if you have previously read all 4 of the stories mentioned above.  Since the first two of these stories are considered classic literature, it should give you an idea that the topics resonate enough to have a lasting impact.  Many greats works can be considered derivative if you go back far enough.  For those who read this book and enjoy it, but haven't read the 4 mentioned stories, I highly encourage you to read them.  Two of them can be found in one book:  [[ASIN:0452277752 The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Richard Bachman (Rage / The Long Walk / Roadwork / The Running Man)]] This is Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman.
B001CB2A1I|3.0|I've been reading SK's books for 20 years now and was almost always impressed by his way with words. Somewhere along the way I did encounter a couple of books which I found disappointing, but with King's productivity level it's a very small ratio. Sadly this is one of those books.    While it's definitely King's writing style, it is overloaded with invented words, which make the reading difficult and instead of adding to the plot they seem to only take from it. The plot itself is quite interesting, but the deliverance is tiresome as the story keeps jumping between different time-lines and events, some of which seem to be pointless to the story.    I wouldn't call Lisey's story a bad book, but it's not a masterpiece for sure. Quite average for SK and thus - disappointing.
B000GIXIGY|5.0|I confess a bit of bias - I have always been fascinated by rock-orchestral collaborations, fascinated and usually disappointed, but not here.  This cd captures renaissance at their artistic peak.  Every song is perfectly crafted.  Annie Haslan's voice is unparalleled. The orchestral parts, for once, seem perfectly complimentary to the prog rock song structure.  The result: gorgeous, phenomenal, triumphant.  I have had this album/cd for 35 years, and it has withstood the test of time.  Much of the prog rock from that era now sounds abysmally self indulgent, a little like a lot of modern jazz - it's like yeah you produced something different but you forgot to put in a little melody.  Emerson Lake and Palmer, Yes, even the Gabriel-led Genesis were all guilty.  To my taste, this cd, as well as Scheherazade are the pinnacle of prog rock artistry.        With respect to the issue raised by another reviewer related to the 2006 version, no comment; just get SOME VERSION of this monumental work and ENJOY!!!
1579126898|3.0|It sometimes felt like watching Craig Ferguson's \\"murder she wrote\\" - without the scottish humor, the style feels old fashioned (in the bad sense of it), the mystery/murder sequence seem dull compared to the violence we're flooded with these days.<br />Not the best Agatha Christie in my opinion; despite its \\"classic among the classics\\" tag, \\"And then they were none\\" would be the one I'd recommend to put in the suitcase heading to that desert island of indispensable books because its plot is so much more revolutionary than this one.<br /><br />Playing my own devil's advocate though, I gotta say the last Poirot I had read was during my teenage years, some 20 years ago, but, despite the style's simplicity, the heavy impressions the plot made on a - then - young person are still vivid today - I guess Agatha wasn't the queen of crime for nothing, there's something genius in the simplicity, the mathematical, cold analysis of the human dark side.<br /><br />So all in all, as an adult, it still is a good read to fall asleep onto, you turn the pages (too ?) quickly and before you know it, all is well that ends...ooops. Mysteriously!
0671449028|4.0|The Going to Bed Book is my son's favorite book by Sandra Boynton. I received it at a baby shower before he was even born. I've been reading it to him aloud since he was a tiny infant. Now he's two, and we love to read it together.    Besides fun illustrations and a cute, simple story, this book has great connections for babies and toddlers at \\"going to bed time.\\" The animals take a bath, hang their towels on the wall, find pajamas big and small, brush their teeth, and then exercise! Tired out, they go back down the stairs, say good-night, somebody turns out the light, and they rock and rock and rock to sleep.     The rhythm and pacing is perfect for getting ready for bed. My son has already taken his bath and brushed his teeth, so it's fun to see the animals do the same things as they get ready for bed. The book slows and ends with repetition, like the rhythmic rocking that we do in his glider as we read. It's a great winding-down book for the end of the day.
0375507256|2.0|I liked the concept of 6 sub-stories  (from life in Belgium 100 years ago to futuristic science-fiction are topics that  can only be appealing to a reader with my caracteristics) but only liked them, didn't love them  : there's better sci-fi books or short stories around, better  novels about the early 1900s in central Europe, and so on...everything it does, it does \\"just ok\\" . The conceptual idea of having 6 half stories as the first part of the book and then going backwards to their unsolving in the second half of the book is what attracted me to the book in the first place-  but  the way they were intertwined was pretty weak, failed to add more than one extra-dimension to the story or some tension to the plot which  would have made it much more appealing and therefore was just a disappointing gimmick.<br />Page turner ? nope<br />Stylish ? Does that mean anything anymore ?<br />Makes you stop once per page to bring you a new idea ? niet<br />All in all, a \\"tepid\\" book, one of those that will make you enjoy the next one even more - but hey, we need those too.
1579128149|5.0|While I am a nerdy person (I teach chemistry), I actually purchased this book at the request of my 11-year-old son. The book is simply gorgeous. Two pages are devoted to each element, and they include a description of some of the properties and common uses of the element, a full-page photograph, and several smaller photos of applications, minerals, or historical references for that element. The pages of the book are black, providing a nice backdrop for the stunning images. The text is interesting and presented at a level that should appeal to non-scientists (and there is a nice introduction to provide some background information as well). For the science nerds among us, each page also shows an emission spectrum, density, crystal structure, graphical representations of melting and boiling points, and other data for the element. Money well spent.
1400063736|3.0|I'd recommend this book only for its middle section which is genius...but the trouble is that you need to read the rest of the book to fully comprehend its power.<br />The book is made of several stories intertwined, the focal point of which being Philippe Petit's walk on a wire between the 2 WTC towers in 1974.<br />It's another story about NY, a story about 9/11 (even if not mentioned, you can't escape thinking of it).<br />The wire journey/middle section is only 10-15 pages  but is the most striking part of it (I discovered I could still get sweaty hands turning pages of a book), the other 400-some pages giving you a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu (there's so many other excellent  - better ? - books about NY, about the past 30-40 years of western civilization out there), a very good d&eacute;j&agrave; vu but one nonetheless.<br />It's fast, stylish (a diet version of de Lillo ?), easy to read, full of political correctness (I gotta say I'm pretty insensitive when it comes to reflexions on priesthood and their actions, whatever they might be) it's got all it needs to be a contemporary classic....but a classic, that'd be a long discussion ? Guess we're still waiting for THE book about 9/11 (or is it already out there ??). In the meantime, I guess this one is not a bad place to start reading about it.<br />NB : get the \\"man on wire\\" DVD and watch it while reading ; on top of being a 5 stars documentary, it gives the book's climax a boost and, well...who would say no to that kind of feeling ?

Since that very first reading, this classic novel of suspense has occupied a place among the very small, very select \\"club\\" of my all-time favorite books.  These are the books that I have read many times and will doubtless read many more times in my lifetime.<br /><br />So many reviews have already been written about this book, and so much has already been said that there's really nothing for me to add.  Except to say that Anna Massey's narration is absolutely superb.  She manages to do what so few narrators can --- she actually makes this book even better.
1591396190|5.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is an outstanding book. It clearly outlines the steps to developing new market space and breaking out of the trap of competing head to head with competition. Red oceans are defined as bloody battlegrounds where companies compete against each other in a head to head fashion. Blue oceans are new market space conceived by forward thinking managers to de-commoditize their businesses. Examples of this are provided such as Curves, Southwest Airlines, Cirque du Soleil, Yellowtail Wine, Bloomberg, and even the New York City Police Department.    Tools such as the strategy canvas, the four actions and the blue ocean idea index are provided to assist the reader in visualizing how to create a blue ocean in their industry.    The authors also provide relevant direction on how to successfully integrate a blue ocean strategy into any company by selling it into the organization correctly. Finally, the very useful appendix provides detailed examples in history of continual blue ocean creation over decades. Examples given are the automotive, computer and theater industries.    I would highly recommend this book to any business person or business student.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|MOON is a beautifully crafted, well-acted play unfolding on a delicate framework of simple music perfectly suited to the desolate mood of the story. It's about a man who suddenly finds himself in a lonely place doing a tedious job for a big impersonal agency. He can't recall his decision to be there. When he wears out, he is replaced with another just like him. He is everyman who finds himself in an empty place doing meaningless work for a system that doesn't care. The movie ends suggesting escape is possible. In real life, however, there is no escape.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|A loathsome claim, of course, but can you argue that \\"Cloverfield\\"'s premise is anything but?  The Empire State Building collapses floor upon floor, pancake-flat, while a cloud of debris billows from the urban canyons; a rain of office papers falls upon the survivors staggering about, their hair plastered with ash.  Brand me a stiff, but I avoided \\"Cloverfield\\" for a long time due to moral objections.  Curiosity eventually got the better of me  -  but served only to reinforce my original opinion.    The 9/11 imagery is not only tasteless but ensures that the movie never works.  We see all this real-world imagery, all this terror with which we're familiar, and then we see that it's being caused by...a giant lizard-thing.  It's as if we were expected to take seriously the latest Al-Qaeda taped video threat were it recorded by Popeye.  The dissonance never heals; I could never suspend my disbelief, and this is from a woman who sat by happily while Jeff Goldblum once disabled an alien fleet with a mid-'90's PowerBook.  The scenario's not scary when it's wrought by something that can't possibly exist because we've already seen it happen from something that does.      The other elements of the film fail to mitigate this.  Of the characters, only Marlena is sympathetic and sensible and dares actually to do stuff despite the perceived handicap of two X chromosomes; the rest of the cast consists of spoiled prissies waiting for the men to rescue them or dudebros, both types badly acted all around.  The camerawork, particularly in the first half, is often poor  -  and, yes, I know it's a cinema vérité shakycam effort.  Compare it, though, to \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"REC,\\" which were convincingly on-the-spot amateur yet allowed us to see what the filmmakers needed us to see; in \\"Cloverfield,\\" it's often just plain impossible to make out ongoing events.  (Plot necessity, though, makes the camerawork unbelievably, ridiculously perfect in certain scenes near the end.)    The film doesget better when it kicks the 9/11 stuff  -  see the effectively creepy subway scenes  -  but it never develops into anything worthy of the imagery it invokes.  \\"Cloverfield\\" isn't disturbing; it's just stupid.

B0035G5IOE|1.0|The praise is evident for this film, but look at the numbers - it barely regained its $40 million budget domestically, and there's a reason for that. The movie is awful by animation standards and there was little 'must-see' buzz about it. Here are a few reasons:<br /><br />- Stop motion animation is creepy, and parts of it look like a very bad Saturday morning cartoon (particularly the parts where they're digging)<br />- The voice acting in this film is horribly bland. Instead of using talented voice actors, like they do in Shrek or any Pixar films, they use an all-star cast of actors who sound as if they didn't know they were recording for a movie.<br />- The characters are not memorable. They won't be living in our memory and kids won't be buying their toys (since there aren't any). Compare this to Up, or Toy Story.<br />- There are no memorable original songs in this, but instead The Beach Boys, for a movie about foxes stealing chickens on a farm.<br />- The story is very predictable.<br /><br />The voices of those who enjoy this film are severely beating those who feel the same way as I do, but ultimately its box office numbers should make it obvious. Good animated films make hundreds of millions of dollars, easily. This didn't come anywhere close.<br /><br />Can those who 'do not find this review helpful' explain why this film was a FLOP and that few people, relative to GOOD animated films, want to see this? Didn't think so.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Several reviews already describe how fascinating this series is, so I just wanted to say something (in a few words) about the blu ray version (region 2) I own.     In short, if you're thinking about purchasing the series, you should absolutely buy the blu ray version. It looks and sounds at least as good as Planet Earth (in blu ray). The picture is most of the times crystal clear, very detailed and rich in all the colours of the natural world. It is basically demo material to show off your HDTV to your disgruntled and jealous parents (in my case). Furthermore, I was also pleasantly surprised by the sound: it is very clear, and it sounds like you are within inches of the events displayed on your screen even when it is about miniature animals such as frogs of 1 cm or something.     After every episode, there is a short making of about the crew and how they did some of the shots in the episode you just witnessed and some more insights about the animals.     I also recommend to get the version of the BBC that is narrated by David Attenborough. I am sure that Oprah Winfrey does an admirable job, but in my opinion it can never replace the enthusiasm and warm voice of Attenborough. Try looking something with him as a narrator, and you'll know what I mean.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|I love Muse, and I am a fairly new convert.  The Resistance is a strong album with one very pop song, \\"Uprising,\\" some more traditional ballads and melodies that are also easily accessible for all music fans, and then the extravagant symphonies at the end.  And these are all good things.  I loved this album.  I love how they are artists of range.  You know they are unique, you know they can cover, and you know they can manipulate familiar sounds to be totally their own in a hip and nouveau way.  And this album proves it all.<br /><br />I always thought their albums were mini symphonies, operas, or soundtracks (whatever you prefer to call it) all their own.  You hear a complete story through the album. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" is a monster!  \\"Guiding Light\\" is powerful and sickly sweet, but in a good way.  \\"I Belong to You\\" is a love ballad by Muse, weird and sweet and ends oh so wonderfully.  Exogenesis is excellent/genius.  I highly recommend this album for someone looking for somethign decadent and over-the-top.  This is a real treat!
156224003X|5.0|Although the book does start slow and just give you background, it does help a musician get over a hump of not playing well. The book also gives one a new way to think about playing. So if you're a player in a rut of your playing this book is a good read and will help get you out of it.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|In this stylish, political mystery-thriller a mostly drunken (unnamed?) ghost writer (Ewan Mcgregor) is pulled in by a publisher to write the autobiography of the ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang, a fictionalized Tony Blair (played by Pierce Brosnan). The PM of the story is now retired on an island off Massachusetts, like Martha's Vineyard, although I don't remember it actually being named. The island is only reached by ferry. The ghost writing job was started by another writer who has died, mysteriously falling off the ferry to the island. Did he commit suicide?  The house where the PM, his estranged wife Ruth, and staff headed by tart mouthed assistant Amelia played by Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City), seems less a home and more a fortress, or a bunker with armed guards. I guess that is what is needed today. The concrete and steel house and the lonely, desolate island with sand and oatgrass, wind, the gray churning stormy skies are symbolic and materially contribute to a sense of gloom, oppression and menace throughout the movie. This mood is enhanced by the cameraman's consistent use of blue and green filters. The house, the environment, is a star of the movie, in a sense.<br /><br />The \\"ghost\\" is given a ludicrously short timeframe, first a month then two weeks to clean up the dead writers work and finish the bio. The PM seems rather reluctant to talk much which makes the writer's job all the more difficult. All involved seem to not want to fill in the bio gaps, they just want the ghost to hurry up and fix the phone book sized bio written by his predecessor. The ghost starts asking questions...<br /><br />Suddenly things turn ugly as protestors start to question the PM's involvement or complicity into Bush Administration policies Guantanamo, rendition, waterboarding, etc. The PM and other people in the bumker house seem to have a bumker mentality. The ghost takes a ride around the island to ask questions of locals and takes the ferry to the mainland to research some ambiguous statements and some pictures he finds. Are there people following him or is he being paranoid?<br /><br />Ex-patriot director Roman Polanski has made a deeply atmospheric movie in the old sense, Hitchcockian (as is mentioned elsewhere), a thoughtful, tense, topical mystery movie for adults, which is so much a rarity today. I will avoid comment on his legal problems and just say that he is a great director and I hope these problems end and he returns to this country and continues to make movies of this quality (like \\"Chinatown\\") rather than the mindless dreck Hollywood mostly cranks out today. It it a sad commentary that this movie isn't, as of today, in the top ten box office releases.<br /><br />This is one of the most intriguing and consistently interesting movies of the new year.us statements and some pictures he finds.

B0002YLC24|3.0|3.5 stars.  If \\"Before Sunrise\\" is as much a valentine to Vienna as it is a story about a youthful romance that only lasts one night, then its sucessor is a valentine to Paris, and what a wonderful Parisian evening it is to reconnect with an old lover.  Jesse and Celine, two young 20-somethings that met on a train 9 years ago and spent one magical night in Mozart's favorite city never kept that appointment to reunite on that train platform in six months.  Jesse, now in his 30s and a successful novelist on the last leg of his first European book tour, has never quite gotten over that fact, nor over the beautiful French girl who captivated him over all those hours all those years ago.  In a cinematic reunion tailormade for Paris, he spots Celine on the periphery of the crowd in Shakespeare & Co. bookstore and instantly is transported back nearly a decade.  Not that he's ever forgotten Celine--she is the heroine, \\"fictionalized\\", he claims, of his novel.  Time once again is a cruel mistress, as the two former lovers have just over an hour to get reacquainted before Jesse's flight departs for the States.    Paris couldn't look better, but it doesn't take more than a few minutes to realize something uncomfortable: our two young lovers, no longer so young, aren't very likeable anymore.  Age and their share of mutual disappointments have honed the less appealing aspects of their more youthful selves into sharp edges.  Jesse has aged worse; Hawke's cheeks look positively gaunt under an unflattering beard, making his teeth look enormous, and his formerly luxurious head of hair is shorn into a trendy, but aging buzz cut. It is nearly impossible to detect remnants of the exuberant American boy Celine met 10 years before.  Delpy is still beautiful, but she looks tired and is noticably thinner, giving her a brittle aura.  This Celine has become the shrill and neurotic harpy that Jesse circa 1994 joked that she might.  Increasing age has not diluted our two protagonists' self-absorption any, but rather has only increased it to near-toxic levels.  It is a very awkward reunion, indeed, with both halves of our truncated couple nursing their private grievances against the other and dealing with adult lives that have largely failed to realize the promise of that night in Vienna. The stiff and careful way Jesse and Celine metaphorically circle one another as they edge tentatively toward bridging the gap of 9 years' worth of time and separate histories in an hour feels real--this project deserves kudos for staying far away from the temptation to make this reunion conform to Hollywood standards of a 'romantic ending'.  Indeed, our two former lovers feel as ambivilent about each other as we do.  Should they, can they, even attempt to reconnect when they still have the problem of continents and an ocean between them?  And, of course, there is the small matter of Jesse's wife and son back home.      After a coffee, a stroll, a ride on the Seine & a tense conversation in a town car, our boy and girl arrive at Celine's door.  She invites him in, gives him tea, and a song and dances to Nina Simone on the CD player.  Her last line is \\"Baby, you're gonna miss that plane.\\"  Do they stick together for good this time, or will it be \\"Before Sunrise, Part Deux\\"?  It is left for the viewer to decide.  Jesse and Celine's rocky romance just may be the last one of its kind put to screen; after all, in this electronic age, with the Internet, Facebook, ubiquitous cell phones, texting and GPS, would it be possible to remain undiscovered by an earnest lover even if you didn't want to be found?  Had Jesse and Celine met just a few years later, it seems inconceivable that they wouldn't have kept in touch by text and Skype for all that time, their electronic connection no doubt becoming as commonplace and dull as they feared it would.  In the end, the lesson our two lovers leave us with is this: if you love someone, don't hold back.  Communicate.  Tell them exactly what is on your mind (and how they can reach you).  The regrets to keeping things to yourself could be too heavy to carry around for a lifetime otherwise.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|Last time I bought any music was a CD in elementary school when everyone was still carrying around portable CD players and thought it was cool (some of us were even still sporting cassette walkmen). Then I got into vinyls and started building up a small collection for the past couple years. This was the first vinyl I bought that was released as new on vinyl. Just received it today in the mail and been playing it on my turntable. All I can say is WOW. The quality is amazing, the music itself is something that cannot be explained, and the overall experience of this music and the fact of it being on vinyl put together makes for an incredible experience. I don't even think I'll get any sort of digital or other format of this album. This is how Jimi was meant to be heard, and I really cannot see it being as good any other way. As for the music itself, some of it is previously unreleased versions of songs you have heard before, and others have never been commercially released at all before. THANK YOU Hendrix family for releasing this, but I hate how now you've broken the flood gates that held back my bank account, and now it's flooding the valleys of the vinyl world (or of neptune ;) pun intended..) But really, if you have a turntable, and any interest in Jimi, do not think twice about this purchase. Great price for a 2LP set of amazing quality (180 gram). I'd start repeating myself if I keep going on, so I'll save you that and just tell you to buy this now!
0790729652|5.0|I ordered the Batman DVD for my husband as this is his favorite movie in the Batman series, and I like as well.  I ordered the movie on 12/4/2009 and received it on 12/8/2009 - very prompt and courteous service from \\"bigredsmitty.\\"  Thank you!!!!  The movie is directed by Tim Burton - full of action, adventure, humor, and a good storyline.  Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Bassinger, and Robert Wuhl are great in their roles.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This movie left me filled with turmoil. I expected a feel good type of movie about a young impoverished Indian who wins it big and immediately improves his life. That is not necessarily what I got.     I did not expect the violence and utter desperation of these characters. It is a heart wrenching story, but also a beautiful love story. I am glad they ended the movie on a happy note. It was certainly well acted.
0345441184|4.0|As a bonafide mythology geek I was gifted with this novel for my 29th birthday. I have read it twice already and I'm going for a third. This book has so much in it! Marion Zimmer Bradley is obviously a lover of Arthurian legend because she goes out of her way to weave everything in there beautifully. Mordred frightened me to a point I could nto describe. A dangerous person raised by a dangerous woman. I want to keep writing but I'm afraid I'll give something away if I do. A brilliant book by a brilliant writer. Nuff said!
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|The Heath brothers offer a very well developed and easy to understand methodology for implementing change in your organization, family, or personal life. The authors build on the concept of boiling change down into three critical activities: 1. Direct the Rider (analytical, rational understanding); 2. Motivate the Elephant (emotional engagement); and 3. Shape the Path (environmental factors). There is not a lot of new content, as the authors use a great deal of research and examples from other Change Management professionals. However, this book is extremely valuable as a concise collection and presentation of a large amount of industry research and real-world examples. The authors did a fantastic job of writing a very readable and engaging book on fairly complex subject.
B001FB55L2|4.0|Brothers is an amazing story that deals with the psychological effects of war.  Both timely and thought-provoking, it deftly illustrates the hardships for soldiers returning home from battle and trying to readjust to civilian life.<br /><br />This movie is packed with stellar performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman.  I was especially surprised and impressed by Tobey Maguire.  This was a different role for him.  He plays a Marine who is sent to Afghanistan to join the war efforts.  His plane gets shot down, and his family is told the tragic news.<br /><br />His brother (Gyllenthal) tries to somewhat step into his shoes and give support to his widowed family.  He left behind two daughters that are still in need of a father figure, and a wife (Portman) that might possibly have needs of her own.  They carry on in his absence, and are shocked and overjoyed at his return.  Although he is definitely a changed man.<br /><br />War is utter hell.  It places an immense burden on all those involved.  What seperates this movie from other \\"dead hero returns home\\" stories is it presents an alarming and intense quandary in the battlefield that also seems very authentic.  The sort of life-altering predicament that has no easy answers or no heroic solution.  Soldiers might be placed with some unfathomably tough choices.  It is easy to contemplate how you would react, but really you have no idea until you are put in that situation.<br /><br />Don't be expecting lots of explosions or battle scenes here.  Brothers is a slow-paced drama that examines themes of family, trust, and insecurities, all of which are effected by the tribulations of battle.  It also profoundly demonstrates the atrocites of war and the horrible burden it places on all of humanity.
031606792X|5.0|I bought the entire set of books just before Christmas. Amazon gave a better price than local book stores, and delivered in plenty of time.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I bought this knife a little while ago and immediately didn't like the grips that it came with, they felt cheap and kind of slippery with wet hands. I took them off and initially wrapped the knife in 550 paracord but was not too crazy about that so I ended up taking leather shoe laces and wrapping the handle and sanding and oiling them down, I wrapped the handle with the leather wet and it has made a very nice comfortable grip that doesn't slide even with wet hands and ( I think) looks a lot better. The edge on the knife came out of the box fairly sharp, definitely good enough for doing most things. I prefer a knife to be extremely shard and don't mind sharpening it a little more often. The steel this knife is made if sharpened at the proper angle will get scary sharp and still hold up to plenty of cutting. I have used this knife for some heavy cutting and chopping but not for log splitting ( you may want to leave the original sharpening angle on it for that kind of work). I would recommend this knife if you are looking for a heavy duty knife ( I use mine for backpacking) but it is kind of heavy. The sheath is pretty good, its not fancy but it gets the job done and the kydex type material its constructed out of should withstand years of abuse. So overall the knife is great with the exception of the grips, definitely recommend the leather wrapping or paracord wrapping (plenty of videos on [...] to show you how).
B0030IIZ56|4.0|wasn't quite sure how much of an upgrade the picture quality would be for blu-ray considering it was one of the \\"older\\" Pixar films.  definitely a BIG jump in quality compared to the DVD.  it's almost like watching a different movie altogether!
B0036JU6CY|5.0|Like another reviewer said, if you're coming to this movie with the mind set of catching some deep philosophical flick, turn around and walk away, this is not for you.<br /><br />That being said, it's a great flick if you're 1. into martial arts and/or like great fight scenes or 2. love love love Rain and would appreciate seeing him in various degrees of disrobe or 3. Both of the above. I'm 3 so this satisfied all my needs. The movie was bloody as hell and was alternately a bit laughable and uncomfortable for that reason, but I found myself looking forward to the awesome fight scenes regardless, I learned something new about Rain as well, as I didn't know he was a martial artist as I haven't seen any Korean films and he is an excellent martial artist.<br /><br />All in all a kick ass good time. Rain is a decent actor, he was neither over the top nor pitiful. The one thing that irritated me about the film was that the lead actress Naiomi Harris is a Brit, but she plays an American, why? I didn't get that because there was no back story to her character that would have deemed that necessary. A good flick though, I recommend.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|After seeing Avatar, I use that movie as a base to rate every other movie I see. It was the most amazing movie I have ever seen!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|If you are a true Mike fan, get this and watch the magic that he was so ready to show the world again!! To me, it was the vintage Mike that we all remember. Even at age 50, he was wowing the younger dancers that was dancing right along with him. This concert would have been one of his greatest ever!! Michael is truly missed and loved and it's still hard to believe that he's no longer with us! I just pray that he gets the justice that he deserves and I pray that his family are all doing well! Michael was (and still is) a gift from GOD to us all!! Let's keep his spirit alive!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not into YA novels and didn't really understand the crossover aspect into adults - but this book hooked me after I downloaded the sample on the Kindle. I couldn't stop reading it - I had to know what happened to Katniss and Peeta. The world Suzanne creates is compelling and believable and many young people spend their lives hunting and surviving, so it also has an important morality lying beneath the story. It was original and enjoyable. Brilliant! and highly recommended.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Just finished the first of two seasons and I have to say that Rome is awesome.  I remember most of the stuff from history classes (e.g. the civil war between Pompey and Caesar), but the way the team portrays events and adds fictional characters to round out the story is great!  I definitely recommend this series and watching it on Blu-ray is a big plus.

B001ECDVYK|1.0|Blood.  Guts.  Foul language.  Psychopathic characters as heros.  Typical Tarantino film even though he did not direct but wrote the script and offered a terrible acting job.  In this case, he added a sharp and unexpected left turn into a vampire flick that turned the film from awful to a total joke.  I missed mentioning one other characteristic of Tarantino movies:  They're all bad.  Not just some - all of them - at least to the extent I can tolerate watching them.  I usually turn them off midway because they have no point beyond violence and evil for the sake of violence and evil and are fundamentally dull no matter how much blood gets spilled or karate punches get thrown.  I watched this film because I had the rare treat of having nothing else to do for two hours, and Showtime was free for the weekend.  If that ever happens again, I'll never make the mistake of filling the time watching anoher Tarantino film.  If you really love his films, you might want to consider counseling.
B000001EC1|1.0|There was a  Jazz CD, in the case, not Bon Jovi.    Since I did not pay much, did not make a fuss, but disappointed.
B002ZNJWI6|4.0|What's not to like here? It has quasi-immortal humans, galaxy-wide sagas that span millions of years, very high technology with a reasonably scientific base, and a portal to the Andromeda galaxy. To top all of this off, the book is essentially a rather moving love story.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I was very happy with the how quickly the DVD arrived, and the condition it was in. Played just fine. Everything was as advertised.
B002VECMAE|3.0|This was a half-enjoyable movie. I'm not sure it said too much but then again, maybe it did.  3.5 stars.
B002VECM6S|4.0|As a based-on-truth film \\"The Blind Side,\\" well-intentioned and uplifting as it is, falls short of a compelling drama. The true story of Michael Oher, a real-life pro football player, and Leigh Anne Tuohy, his adoptive mother, is certainly inspirational, but the film's storyline itself looks sometimes formulaic, or even predictable. But where the film lacks creativity and imagination, the star Sandra Bullock almost single-handedly makes up for them with her strong performance.    It is Sandra Bullock and her Oscar-winning performance that lifts the film from being an average bio-pic to a first-class dramatic piece of work. She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a wealthy wife and mother who takes in Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a homeless boy who later becomes a Baltimore Ravens player. It is great to see what Sandra Bullock can really do. She plays the role with warmth and humor.    You may say \\"The Blind Side\\" is a feel-good film, but for some viewers \\"The Blind Side\\" feels too good. Director John Lee Hancock (\\"The Rookie\\" \\"The Alamo\\") forgoes opportunities to create dramatic tensions, such as Leigh Anne's decision to adopt Michael. Some episodes look out of place. Strange remarks about the \\"dead bodies\\" by Michael's private tutor Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) is one example. Did he really believe that?      \\"The Blind Side\\" is a good example of a film where superb acting of the star lifts the drama above the genre. This happened many times before - Richard Dreyfuss did it in \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" or recently Emily Blunt in \\"The Young Victoria\\" - and this happened again with Sandra Bullock and her wonderful performance.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Ghost Ship is a cut above the typical horror movies churned out with no-name casts, poor acting, and little imagination.<br /><br />This movie has a solid cast, great special effects, and errie scenes that make this movie on par with movies like \\"The Shining\\" (Jack Nicholson). ..The very young Emily Browning really shines in this movie.<br /><br />The only negative is the DVD cover. It looks like something designed for a low budget, 2nd rate, waste of time. ..But like they say, \\"You can't judge a movie by the DVD cover\\".<br /><br />Ghost Ship is on my horror movie Top Ten List. ..<br /><br />--
B002BIULQ2|5.0|Hannah Montana The Movie is a great movie. It's a touching story about staying true to who you are and where you come from. I was happily surprised and I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie too.
B00008R9KF|5.0|I am a huge fan of Daniel Day-Lewis so I had to see what all the fuss was about...they were right, this is a great movie. It's a British Dramedy about a Indian family and their trials and tribulations in London. Great dialog and writing. Don't think you'll see another movie with Daniel Day-Lewis like this in it??
1410420442|5.0|I am really not sure how to review Catching Fire without spoiling book 1, so I am going to keep this brief.<br /><br />Just as they did in Hunger Games, the characters in Catching Fire captured my heart and didn't let go. I sobbed several times and I will even admit there were times I wanted to throw the book. The story and the situation surrounding Katniss feels so desperate, its emotionally exhausting. I kept muttering to myself how things weren't fair and at times I questioned my sanity for becoming so emotionally connected to this story. But isn't that what a good story is supposed to do for you? A great book binds you to its world and the people in it, it keeps you reading even when your heart is breaking.<br /><br />Catching Fire easily earns a 5 star rating from me. Once again Suzanne Collins delivers on the emotion, character depth, and suspenseful plot that keeps this Vixen coming back for more. If you haven't started this series yet, I ask... what are you waiting for? The final book, Mockingjay, comes out this summer and you won't want to miss it.
1408460300|2.0|I enjoyed Angels & Demons and the Da Vinci Code, but Dan Brown's latest effort was a big disappointment.  While I don't expect great English literature when I read Brown's books, I do expect a cohesive plot and interesting dialogue.  The plot was very simplistic and it felt like Brown was stretching at times to tie things together (the silly sensory deprivation chamber is a good example).      While the villans in his previous books were interesting, I think Brown was just going for shock factor in the Lost Symbol.  The dialogue is very unrealistic and has a sappy quality to it.  The characters constantly speak to each other as if they are teaching a college level course on Masonic symbology (a lot like the preachy quality of the dialogue in the movie adaptations of A&D and Da Vinci).  I expected a lot more given the amount of time Brown spent on this one.

B001FB563E|3.0|I have to admit, after reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I was curious about how they could make a movie out of it. The book had very little dialog, the characters were never really developed, and no questions in regard to how their situation came about were addressed. In effect it was a tale of a father and son surviving. Period. There were no extended plans for a better life, just survival one day at a time. I found it to be dreary, depressing, and largely without a coherent direction. The movie does a decent job of bringing the bleak hopelessness of the novel to the screen, and maybe a better job of forming an attachment to the characters, but overall I found the same lack of hope and direction. I found the story to be a good intellectual exercise, but as entertainment I can certainly understand why the movie didnt fare well.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games drops you into a future where the United States has been destroyed and all that remains is Panem, a dystopian civilization made up of 12 districts and a Capital city. The Capital controls everything with an iron fist and a previous attempt at rebellion by the 12 districts resulted in the creation of a disturbing event known as the The Hunger Games. Every year each of the 12 districts has to choose one girl and one boy to compete in this televised game of survivor where you either win or you die, and there can only be one winner.<br /><br />Katniss is a 16 year old girl with far too much responsibility on her shoulders. She protects and provides for her mother and sister with no regard for herself. She is independent, caring, and humble. When her sister's name gets pulled from the glass bowl as this year's female tribute to the Hunger Games, there is no question that Katniss will take her place. I loved Katniss from page 1 of this book. She is so strong, and yet still a vulnerable 16 year old when no one is looking. I had tears in my eyes and a sob in my throat before I had even gotten to page 25 because of the lengths she went to for her family. Katniss is a character you will root for and become emotionally attached to.<br /><br />The beginning of the novel started a bit slow for me, it was all necessary to the story but I was anxious to get to the games and to find out whether Katniss even had a chance at staying alive. Once I got a third of the way through, I simply could not put this book down. The story was action packed, smart, and captivating. My pulse raced and I held my breath along with Katniss every step of the way. I felt her despair and desperation. I felt her joys and her I cheered her on.<br /><br />If you are looking for a smart, fascinating, unique story with noble and likable characters then Hunger Games will not disappoint you. Don't let the Young Adult genre designation dissuade you, book lovers of all ages with enjoy this one.
B002VECMAO|3.0|The premise of The Men Who Stare At Goats should be enticing enough for one to jump in on, and it proves to be a plenty enjoyable satire that boasts great performances from all involved.  What stops it from being something truly great however is that it isn't nearly as funny and comedic as it could be, and the end result is that the film overstays its welcome.  Ewan McGregor stars as journalist Bob Wilton, whose wife has recently left him, and thus has embarked on a journey to Kuwait.  While there, he meets Lyn Cassaday (George Clooney), a self-proclaimed \\"Jedi warrior\\" psychic trained by the Army years before.  Claiming he's on a secret mission, Lyn and Bob soon embark to Iraq.  Clooney and McGregor, along with Jeff Bridges as the pioneering Django and Kevin Spacey as the nefarious Hooper, give great performances.  However, The Men Who Stare At Goats simply doesn't have enough satirical moments to fully propel it forward.  Not to mention that by the end of the film, you're left wondering just what was the point?  Still, there are much worse ways to kill time, and for what it's worth, The Men Who Stare At Goats is breezy, enjoyable entertainment.
1423101499|5.0|It's a good book.  I think that even adults that are young at heart would enjoy reading this!  As a matter of fact I like the whole series......  This series makes Greek mythology much more enjoyable than school.
1423113497|5.0|My boys love these books! Just saw the movie and they can't wait to finish the series!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|This is a great movie.  The only thing I don't like is that I was not there with Jack White, The Edge, and of course Jimmy Page.  If you are a guitar guy you will love this movie.  It gives great insight on the music, the beginnings, and encourages you to keep rockin.  \m/
031606792X|3.0|I love to hate this book! Ok, maybe hate is too strong a word but I'm so disappointed with the premise this whole book is built on. The showdown with the Volturi is made null and void with Bella's transformation so now we need something else to trigger a showdown...enter: Rename please, I mean Reneesme. Stephenie Meyer did two no no's. In Twilight when Edward and Bella were discussing sexual urges Edward responds to Bella stating \\" I may not be human but I'm still a man.\\" NO EDWARD! If you are NOT human you are NOT a man. You are however MALE. Stephenie makes this same mistake again on pg.126 of Breaking Dawn. She goes through this lengthy explanation of how Rosalie could not have children because \\"She was frozen in the state in which she passed from human to inhuman. Totally unchanging(pg.126).\\"  This setup begs the question: If Rosalie is inhuman, isn't Edward also inhuman?  She then continues to argue the HUMAN perspective stating Charlie Chaplin fathered children well into his seventies and that \\"Men had no such thing as child-bearing years or cycles of fertility.\\" Okay, that's all fine and dandy but EDWARD IS NOT A MAN! See my frustration?  But oh it gets worse.... when Jacob imprints on Reneesme I had about all I could stand. Why Stephenie? Why?! Even though Rename me is not venomous she is still HALF vampire... a NATURAL \\"enemy\\" of the wolves! What they are designed to kill! Her somewhat sticky sweet smell should have repulsed him for crying out loud! And since wolves don't imprint on the infertile (Leah Clearwater became infertile because of her wolf transformation) I guess we should expect a wolf/ human/ vampire offspring should you continue this story?    Billy Black called the wolves spirit warriors then shape shifters 9Eclipse). So Stephenie, why is Jacob puzzled shrugging his shoulders when Aro says this? Jacob should know he is not part of the \\"children of the moon\\"!!!    You know what else grates my nerves? Stephenie was too intimidated to write a tasteful love scene but she went no holds barred in a very agonizing birthing scene, and to add insult to injury Edward initially intended to transform Bella via a needle shot of venom sraight to her heart. It took her almost \\"dying\\" for him to bite her... how disappointing.   Last but not least, my favorite Cullen disappeared the majority of the book (Alice) and the Volturi showdown... what showdown? This was a big let down of epic proportions. An anti- climatic end to an entertaining series. I'll pretend BD never happened : ) This book should not have made it past her editors desk!
