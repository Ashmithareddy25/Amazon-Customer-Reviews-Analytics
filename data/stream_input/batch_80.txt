B00QK40D4I|5|Fast delivery. Easy to install!
B0035XGPNA|5|This stuff is awesome.  Best stuff to keep your rims clean.
B0053SKJAK|5|Threads mate-up just fine with those on my 35-gal. water barrel, plus it pumps (& siphons) just fine so far.
B0034BWF5U|1|Absolute Garbage<br /><br />Worked for 13 days, can not get seller info for return or replacement.<br /><br />Avoid Product<br /><br />Avoid Seller
B000NVW1LM|3|No miracles on rear main seal on a Subaru.  Still consuming about the same.
B00FC22AS6|3|Headlights have an issue with only one light turning on instead of both. Can be cured by turning lights off and then waiting a minute or so then turning them back on.  Lights have not even been installed for a whole year and I had the wiring on one of the ballasts short out and stop working. Aside from that they are amazing for dark roads at night, and low beams are more than enough.
B00VMMALKY|5|When I bought my new car a few months ago, I wanted license frames that showed my inner comic book geek. This was an awesome fit! The only issue I have with this frame is that non-comic book friends think that I have cute flowers on my license plate.
B009MATA0A|4|Effective but at the cost of being bulkier to roll versus accordion fold. Worth the extra $ for quality otherwise
B00NBEY3PA|5|Very happy with purchase. Couldn't have been any better.
B006QGD9QY|4|As described
B00XMFAY8I|3|Software will not load properly unless you have a copy of IE4.01 (SP2) -- not suited for all computers as software was designed for win95 win 98  though using virtual machine you can run this with XP
B00Q7P9WHO|5|Free shipping from Amazon and amazing peace from ETS
B000C5M272|5|Fast delivery and no more vibration in my car and very very very easy to install on a 97 toyota corolla.
B0006BJRH0|5|this product is wonderful
B00KXSDJIY|5|no review
B000C9WJ3A|5|They wanted twice as much at the local auto parts store. I paid $15 and with the help of a Youtube video, had it changed out in minutes. Thanks for saving me  $$$$$$!!!!!!
B008SEM724|4|It seems to me that the quality of this product is very close to the factory one.<br />I recommend.
B003V0GG18|4|Smallish bag but fits great in my MINI!
B000TK3TMC|5|Easy to install and VERY bright!!
B00SDMJLQ6|2|I bought this after switching my daughter to a high back booster and her having trouble buckling herself. It is made very well except it does not fit my 2014 Honda CRV.  I was so bummed. Will be sending it back.
B00UBIUOV6|4|I love it. Very nice.
B00EDG0MTG|5|Easy to install,easy directions, a big money saver!
B0042HU3GS|2|New to detailing, but I used a Porter Cable 7424XP with Hex Logic pads and the Chemical Guys' V Line before applying this wax/sealant. I was working on a '66 Mustang. The paint looked great after using V36 (orange pad) and V38 (white pad). Very shiny, very glossy... the ol' ball and chain said it actually looked like I had got a new paint job.<br /><br />This wax, however, was much harder to wipe off than I expected. The product instructions say to either let it dry to a haze for a few minutes or to wipe it off immediately. I tried both methods, but either way I had to apply a lot of pressure and rubbing to get the wax off. Maybe that's how all waxes are, but in the end it actually looked like this wax dulled the paint in some spots... which was a shame because it essentially undid my hard work with the V36 and V38. Maybe I did something wrong, but I think I'll try a different wax/seal before going back to this one.
B00Z515O5K|5|These Jump Start It Jumper Cables are exactly what my fiance needed since he's been driving around for years without any. There has been a time or two when I would think to myself &#34;what in the world is he gonna do if his battery dies and needs a jump with no jumper cables?&#34;. I have little to no car knowledge but I do know that jumper cables are pretty much vital for any car driver no matter what so I decided to get these jumper cables for him. When I gave them to him and told him to put them in his car he was really appreciative and said that he had been wanting to get some but it just never dawns on him when he has the chance.<br /><br />These jumper cables are 12 feet long so they will definitely not be too short. They aren't cheaply made or flimsy at all. The jumper cables come with a carrying bag which my fiance really liked because he doesn't have to worry about the cables being all over his trunk and he doesn't have to worry about anything damaging them. Taking the cables out and in of the bag is very easy because they fit in the bag perfectly! I would definitely recommend these Jump Start It Jumper Cables!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**
B00N2RCYHA|4|Thank you
B0040CVV4I|1|didn't match the vehicle stated
B000HBNU9K|5|Worked great.  Good product.
B00GWGWML6|1|Pretty crappy. I could've got the same quality of not better at the local flea market for $1.00. Will not purchase again.
B00O3TE3EI|5|awesome stickers!
B00MRHKHDY|1|Horrible quality. Would never recommend buying them. When you torque them down the paint goes away and they don't really hold your wheel properly......
B000VTULPY|4|works, but its over priced imo.
B009FUF6DM|5|Great to deal with a great product!
B000IG20RW|5|Good product
B00MJLCV5U|5|Fast delivery, bulbs included and plugged right in!
B00EEEB77I|3|These are very effective at sucking up water, and can be wrung out quickly and easily. Would work really well for drying freshly washed cars. They don't hold nearly as much water as Absorber towels, though. For grooming purposes, Absorber is still the top dog.
B004IA7SC6|5|Perfection
B00KGGTF9U|5|Seems to work well to keep car interior cooler and to prevent UV damage. Too soon to comment on durability. Folds easily and compactly. Excellent value.
B000E3V9R6|5|The only odd thing about this is the instructions tell you to use a hole saw I'm fairly sure doesn't exist (at least in most hardware stores). It says to use a 2-7/8&#34; holesaw. A 3&#34; seems to do the job just fine.
B00BZSDZSK|4|A little hard to put on but worth the effort. Looks great.
B00V8K9PU2|5|Was what I expected and came when expected
B0107WKYV0|5|The stickers look just great on my BMW and fit really well. Before sticking, I just cleaned my grille, then the sticker affixed very good and fast.
B00BGJBMC4|5|Been good to me so far. Used one to replace my license plate light and two for map lights on my 2009 g6.
B00MR1LVZS|2|charp!
B004EIAADG|2|I bought this from Lowes and really liked all the features and capacity, but after having it only two weeks it started leaking battery acid and burned a few holes in my favorite leather computer chair (attached photo) that I had the misfortune of setting it down on. So back to Lowes it went for a refund. Sad, I had high hopes for this.
B00LNGHHEM|4|Perfect pipe after I cut off the muffler that came with a broken weld on the end cap. Sounds,looks,and performs well.
B000GV96F8|4|Worked well gained a little over 2 inches
B0068OZ25K|1|Don't buy this. Cheap plastic poor quality
B004F63RYQ|4|I wanted it to be more sturdy but it gets the job done.
B002UC4YFI|5|Perfect size to accommodate my receiver extension. Fabrication is very neat and the harness works as expected.
B00MRCK23E|5|These LED lights are actually a positive surprise. They really light up your license plate and nice bright white light. Very readable, much brighter than the stock halogens.
B00822YV3A|1|I learned the hard way - better put some anti-seize under aluminum valve stem caps!!! Had to cut the whole stem off to check my tire pressure. Also the scorpions fell off after a month.
B00MFZA61Q|5|LOVE IT!!
B004GZMQS4|5|looks nice no rust...I do recommend this item
B002X9ULF0|3|I have 5 vinyl decals on my car right now. I've probably applied about 50 of them in my lifetime. This has been by far the worst quality, oddest sized one I've ever purchased. It's just awkwardly big and has very cheap thin vinyl. It's the only one I've ever had that has bubbled up so much and not had a clean application. I'll probably end up removing it if it doesn't get damaged in the winter.
B000C55V52|5|These springs worked pretty well for me. When I fist installed them they gave my 4Runner a super aggressive stance that has since leveled out to a mostly even look to the ride height of the front end. Here is a link to a video of me installing these springs on my truck https://youtu.be/TEiWxJJzKbg It went very well for me. Now over a year later I am still happy with them.
B0045MVJEU|3|It arrived quickly and looks great!It is just very thin material. I am not really sure how well the material will hold up in bad weather.
B00KTJ7U3M|5|Awesome  got it worked perfectly would deal with them anytime
B000IDUW5C|5|Bought one for myself and one for my son, just in case to save a life.
B0006MQIY4|5|has exactly what was in the description in a cute easily carried container.
B00ONJ9K46|5|Unlike Meguiar's quick spray detailer which is like water, this has some substance to it, it works perfect on those in between wax days when a little dust/road dirt gets to your car and you want to remove it without scratching the finish. Quality product
B00P2D471I|5|Just installed these today and they work well for the price paid.  Would recommend.
B00AN5RF4G|2|Wrong parts
B000HEBR3I|5|Love it and it works really good,.
B0009H52BG|5|I know Fram has a bad rep with some people, but I've never had a problem. I love the grip on these, it makes it easy to change without a filter wrench
B006MX8196|5|I bought this for my 2014 Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab. Although they seem cheaply made, they are quite durable. I use my truck for work, and they have stood up to mud, rain and everything between.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Great
B00VQ6LN4Y|5|Very happy, these lights fit in bumper of 88-91 honda CRX perfectly. Shipping quick, honest seller. Very good price & product. 👍👍👍💯%😸
B003KTWKX8|5|Perfect fit for my 93 Suburban!
B00NQM480C|3|Honestly, the picture adverstised does look better than the actual product.  I do like the idea and the material is decent quality but the 3m tape on the back just does not stick!!!! I read a lot of the reviews and they said the same thing but I didn't listen.  Go figure.  Kind of hard to cut to exact measurements also so that it looks like a good fit but I do like the idea.
B00QMSRXJK|5|Reasonable price, works out great
B00MS97L6W|4|great LED lights no major wiring
B00V2XHPLQ|1|Terrible I never did get the entire set as advertised. You can't comunnicate with the people that sent me the light. I don't advise anyone to purchase it. Light is ok for the money.
B001FCAYYO|3|Quick and easy to install, but needs to be wider.  Approx. 4-6&#34; on each side is left exposed/unprotected...
B008YFHKYM|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B007V2EKRE|5|Very good quality.  It's a bit expensive but well worth it.  Easy placement and removal.  Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B004ZIX1J0|5|I love steel sprockets from Sunstar. This fits my 2013 YZ250 perfectly and allowed me clearance to run a sand paddle tire without having to remove the stock flap that protects the rear shock. And with a -2 tooth on the rear (stock is 49), this gives more top speed for the sand dunes. I am very pleased with the price, durability, and fitment.
B00A7YUIO2|5|It's a brush that cleans pipes.
B000CNJN6M|5|Perfect for my 351 with a hard to beat price.
B0009H51U8|5|Delivered on time. Product as expected.
B00C7I4XQ0|4|Good for a picnic or toiletries kit fora traveler.  It's in my shave kit and working out just fine.
B000H6MNRU|5|Works  great  makes  it  easier  to  polishing  much  faster
B009AZ58L2|5|I like the color better than the beigh this is a tab darker it better for the dirt.
B0010B00IA|3|doesn't keep liquids as cold as i would have hoped but i should have known being a soft shell cooler
B00KY9BX6C|2|It turns on but after a minute it turns off . Not satisfied at all.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|great fit would buy another one
B00HJ6O4A0|5|So easy to use! Love how quickly I was able to set it up and take it down by myself. Very spacious. Sand bags worked great for holding it down on the beach. So glad I went with this product!!
B007GT7IQW|5|Wanted floor mats that could blend in, yet still sport the Audi emblem. These fit my expectations perfectly. Have had them on for almost 6 months and have yet to see any wear or tear!<br /><br />Note to manufacturer/seller--- Would have liked to purchase the front two mats separately. None the less, thanks for the great deal!
B00Q8IZQLQ|1|Started leaking right after putting on and they wont return an item that has been opened. Defectived product.
B00U26LTZW|5|Easy to install and good quality
B000CRO4IK|5|good
B00LPIOZ7K|5|Fit right and not too bad to install, took under an hour.
B008BSB03E|5|It fit my sons 110 without any problems.  The Handle was a little shorter the the original one.
B0007IFXHA|5|Fit my 2004 Jetta TDI easily and didn't take me long to install having never done it before.
B009B42GKI|5|Easy
B008J151H4|4|Could be more louder but defintely better than my oem miata beep beep horn. 👌
B00HR0BCZI|5|As expected
B00S4HHVLW|4|I just installed this unit. It was the only one I could find that would hold a 6 lug wheel. Some of the galvanized coating was chipped off on the end of the pipe when it came in. I would expect the hardware to rust pretty quickly as it is not heavily coated and I will be using it on a saltwater trailed. I had to mount to aluminum, so I made some plastic insulator pads to keep the steel from touching the aluminum and corroding. The 6 lug wheel fits but just barely. It does not fit 2 holes straight across from each other, it actually fits between two holes on one side of the wheel. I sprayed the hardware down with some corrosion protection spray, so hopefully that helps.  It looks to be a decent unit, but it has not been to the water yet, so I will keep an eye on it and update any issues.
B000S2UGWC|5|Excellent.
B00JXS39VC|3|package was all ripped up and some parts where missing.
B00CNI1SDA|4|My leather couch looks great!
B00B5ZY07I|4|Simple to install and certainly look better than plain screw heads!
B007F12VEA|5|Just as expected the sticker arrived in great shape and I used it to dress up a barstoll in the man cave.
B00A763TC8|5|A++++++
B004B68XGC|5|This is an outstanding system. Using it it pump up 90psi RV tires
B000VA93MK|5|A GREAT AMERICAN MADE PRODUCT! We NEED more like it!<br /><br />Bought this little Oiler to lube some electric fans and locks. Works great. The trigger is a little sensitive so don't pick it up with the trigger. I have not had any leakage issues, like some others. I don't leave it out in the sun. And its made in the USA!
B0034EM93U|5|excelent. It was that I need......
B00A2XD8SQ|5|I MOUNTED THIS SPARE TIRE RACK ON TO MY TRAILER AND IT HAS WORKED GREAT ! !
B000OV32MI|5|very handy. really helps keep up with parts
B000182B9Y|5|cant beat the price  thanks bb
B00U3D90LY|4|It help me
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Can't say I use this very often, but it does work great.  It helped me realize the fuse in my battery tender was blown, even though I couldn't tell by looking at the fuse.
B00GLJYLKO|5|2003 Pontiac Vibe.  I wanted something brighter at night, and wanted more of a white light to keep my headlights from hazing over again. This work excellent at seeing clearly at night. At dusk they can be a little iffy to tell if they are on, as they are is no yellow line to follow anymore. I went and added Hipro Power 9006 5900K 100 Watt Super White Xenon HID Fog Light Bulbs for my fog lights, and those work excellent for adding something to right in front of the car.  Have not had these for very long, about a month or so, and am hoping they last for a while (6 months), I know that they won't last as long as traditional headlights, but I will be able to see more clearly at night.
B00OXPXUAK|1|does not work at all defective
B00FQ0ROZS|4|What a smokin deal for 4 of these. Tons of places to put these. I'll now be able to update my work truck and remove the four ugly &#34;Old School&#34; lights from the 90's I had on there. They put out about as much light as you would expect, ( they are not mega dollar lights ) but for this price I'm happy with them.
B00EKCZKVI|1|didn't come with mini emblem like shows in picture and that really upset me!!
B007NZ91S2|3|Replaced both sides of a 2009 Subaru. One side only lasted 6months before a boot cracked.<br />The other is still going about a year later.<br />For the price I might buy again but you do so at your own risk.
B0006U21MO|5|excellent
B004AG8Q56|5|I was looking for a quality  brake rotor that can withstand harsh winters without rusting. Bosch QuietCast part has a durable protective aluminum/zinc coating that covers the entire rotor, inside and outside. The immediate benefit is that rotor will less likely rust into the wheel hub -  a common problem for cars driving in the &#34;salt belt&#34;.<br /><br />Prior the installation I washed the rotors with mild soap per manufacturer's website guidance to wash out any manufacturing debris.  After installation the rotors exhibited no vibration nor any squeaking noise (I pared them with ACDelco Professional brake pads) even during the brake-in period. The rotors match the color of my car open aluminum wheels and look great with them. It is too early to tell how long the coating will stand, so I will update my review in the future.
B0010E00T6|5|do the job
B0009PSJ22|3|not as strong as I expected
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Nice quality.
B007P73XRS|5|came quick , no damage , thankyou
B007OW672M|5|Wiper blade fits and works great
B001BN3KHA|1|How about some product information!!!!!<br />Seriously the name/model only.<br />If you have to use other people's site for research then why not just buy from them also.
B00DSD4MO6|5|Now I have to figure out where to stick it!
B00DF4JPAE|5|great
B012FLOEYY|4|I got four of these since many people I've read the reviews from said their new ones failed. I have a 2000 F-250 , two door work truck and I'm ready to install my 2008 and newer mirrors I just purchased from Amazon. Since I will already have the door panels off of the truck, now will be the time to change out the bad actuators, and keep the two other new ones as spares.
B00ETHGCDY|5|It looks awesome!!
B000182ESC|5|Love the way it looks on the front of my 1998 Chevy Tahoe
B00AI5X8J2|5|Its a steering wheel cover. It says JEEP. It fit. Nuff said =)
B00P2VMFFU|5|PERFECT FIT !!! nothing else to say about it.
B0029UM2A0|5|good
B00VHGBVW2|5|Good Solid Product.
B00Q7G2O0U|1|The mounting bracket doesn't align between the rear brake caliper and pipe mount. It was off by about 10mm. From experience most solid mount pipes like this crack from vibration over time. The sound and power are good.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Long life
B00THRJZSK|4|Used on 2015 Dodge Ram, crew cab, husband said it was big but he is still using it. Has to use something to hold down the cover from the wind ( Monterey, CA).
B00SQTZ1II|2|I purchased these for a 1995 Cadillac Eldorado. These links do not have a allen/torx socket in the stud or a wrench flat to keep the ball stud from spinning during installation/removal. That's probably fine on some applications, but for mine I would prefer a way to keep it from spinning. I do like Mevotech products, but I won't be using this one.
B00BOEFEPC|5|Fit perfectly in rear cupholder
B00UMWZVV4|4|The wiring was not clearly explained.  Other wise works great.
B00469L0KA|1|Left lots of smears and spots and not absorbent.  Material seems too slippery to work well.  I don't like it.
B0009VF1DQ|5|Great Gift !
B0056OFWVM|2|I wanted to love these straps.  I hate having all the flapping ends of the standard tie downs.  Also they are quick and easy to tension, solid build and seemed like a great product....until I tried to tie down a Polaris on a trailer.  I had 4 of these each mounted to a corner and I guess I surpassed the 1200 lb break strenght 400lb load rating when I hit a bump and the polaris bounced because one of the straps snapped as if it was yarn.  Before these straps I used the same rated standard ratchet straps and never had one break on me.  I guess I am going back to the standard strap and tying down the loose ends since I have lost faith in these retractable straps.  3 other 3 I have will be relegated to holding down canopies and maybe coolers.  I will also say that with the ratcheting mechanism they are a lot heavier than the standard strap.
B00NWO3S50|5|Fit perfect genuine Toyota part.
B0013FWACW|5|Solved my issue whereas I had a intermittent miss on acceleration until engine warmed up.
B00KNEG1MY|5|Good drift wheels and tyres. Grip well but also slide well.
B00FEDKOPE|5|Very nice piece,
B004RFT3KM|5|This tool is amazing!!  No more pinched fingers while trying to fish the valve stem through the hole in the rim!!!<br /><br />After using this tool a few times, I ordered a second one.  I keep one in my tool box in the garage, and keep one on my bike.  This tool makes road side tube fixes so much faster and easier.  After using this tool, I can't imagine changing a tube without one!
B00ECJJYAC|5|Good product, sealing the bottom of a WW2 trailer and all areas exposed to the elements. Prompt arrival and a good price.
B000VXH88I|4|works great easy install
B0053OIITS|5|Cheaper than the auto parts stores's price, and I don't have to waste any gas driving there.  What a great deal!  Prime it up and two days later you are ready to paint!  I have always like duolicolor color match, it sprays on very evenly and the colors are pretty close to dead on!
B00L4IAXJK|3|Worked fine. Does not come with a screw.
B00L84EKI0|5|Works great...remember to lube the inside of this tool with some grease...if not the plastic oil filter housing will get stuck to the tool...& you'll have fun trying to separate it.
B00P2QLN2G|4|Decent for the price, like the pictures of V-Twin.
B00NLOO6Y8|5|Side window deflectors snapped in easily and fit perfectly. They are very low profile which I love because they do not look foreboding on my coupe.
B000182EXW|3|Improperly made for the truck I ordered them for. The rear vent shades were 6 inches too short and the front ones were bent wrong. I sent them back for a refund. They were good for the refund. Their bug shields are 100% first rate though I love them.
B00GZHC0G4|1|Get serious GE! I thought with a name like that, they would come through with their advertised features. Yes, brighter, but nowhere near white, which is what one is looking for when buying this product (even at the expense of only 100 hours of lifespan). The word xenon in the name is totally deceitful. They are 30% brighter at most (definately not 130%) which is not much when you take into account that their lifespan is 10% that of the car's original bulbs. I returned them because the are yellow and not as bright as the manufacturer claims.  I should have listened to the bad reviews, they were all true.
B00651CLCS|5|Worked perfectly!
B000JLNBW4|5|fridge literally holds six 12 oz. cans  but they are cold
B00YHY10XQ|5|Great product, fast delivery, just as described.
B00B0PAUVI|5|It fit perfectly in my ATV
B000CN937G|5|Awesome product!!! Super fast shipping!!! Thank you VERY MUCH!!!
B00B4CTKA4|5|It was a perfect fit and my vehicle is running great.
B000XRHRZQ|5|Great material and price. Just love it.
B005VPSENE|4|matches my trailblazer, just need to buy one for the driver side so they both will match.
B000GZHYNK|3|Good quality - very thick and easy to apply.  Do not care for the &#34;swiss cheese&#34; look with all the perforations in them.
B0002NYE5W|5|great job ! A +
B005J43I56|4|Good 1&#34; mount for my iPhone 6 or other RAM products.
B009BNFNJA|5|Fun!
B00CM57YEQ|5|These are really excellent towels!  For drying a car these are superb - just the right size to pick up a good bit of water and perfect size for squeezing out. Great for removing wax haze, too - can use one in each hand!  They're thin enough to work easily, yet not so thin as to be useless. The light colors let you see when you're picking up dirt, too - so you know when it's time to switch to a clean one.  I haven't used any around the house, but am sure they'd be good for that as well and, supposedly, microfiber will pick up bacteria better (up to 99%) than cotton or other cloth (about 33%).<br />FOLLOW-UP:  These wash up really well - wash a group of them together - certainly not with anything else, particularly clothes!  Do NOT use softener - it will ruin microfiber! Air dry in dryer - they dry quickly and they come out nearly like new.  The microfiber composition of these (80% polyester - 20% polyamide) is excellent and much better than slightly cheaper ones (often 100% polyester) that can be purchased elsewhere. More % of Polyamide seems to make for a much better towel with more absorption.
B0051RI3RE|5|Great look fits well...
B000KK92WW|5|I attached these to the roof of my Ford escape so that I could fit my rods.  One in the back, one in the front.  Works great.
B007MNUAIA|5|thanks
B00JF5LRN0|2|One tiny lip around the edges would have been all I needed.  There is none so things smaller than the upper bar slide right out.
B00AWYD7RC|5|Quick Shipping- Item just as described
B000C2A3IK|4|Came guick
B001PYRB84|5|Works well for my dodge neon 2005 SXT. I would say way better that the actual stock parts.
B00H874CMA|5|Does its job. Installed immediately. Looks good. Delivery fast and well packaged.
B005C2PT2K|5|Beautiful an sparkly just what I wanted
B008KPYCVU|4|I like the secure fit
B00MW4MY4M|5|nice little sticker, actually sticks well and last even in the desert heat!
B005LSPX30|1|It's not really rubber. It's a foam that's just as slippery as the carpet. Waist of money.
B00AQI8SH8|5|It works great. It was hard to install this with given pins. Used the old black pins that goes into the sockets and it was a done in 1 min. It looks original too.
B00YE5Q132|5|I love the idea of a portable car jumper that will also charge your cell phone (or pretty much anything else).  It's compact-- it'll fit in the glove compartment, remarkably light weight, and comes in a well-made case that has places for the charger, the auto cables, and the eight adapters, for charging everything from your phone to your laptop to your electric razor.  In addition, it lights up!  It has a broad-beamed flashlight to illuminate your work area (because car batteries tend to die at three in the morning), and bright red/dim blue emergency flashers to keep you from getting run over while charging the car at three a.m.<br /><br />As a car charger, it's a piece of cake to use-- attach the clamps to the battery (red-red, black-black), then plug it into the DBPower.  Turn on the DBPower, and start your car.  Get back out of the car, turn off the DBPower, unplug the cables, and take them off the battery.  And driver happily away.<br /><br />Just to confuse the reviewer, the DBPower has two shiny strips of metal on the top, that look like they should be battery terminals or somesuch.  So far as I can tell, they're just decorative.<br /><br />I was sent this gratis in order to evaluate and review it, and my expectations were exceeded.  This is a fine addition not only to a car kit but to a household emergency kit for folks who live in the sorts of places frequented by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or zombie apocalypses.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0073MF7QA|5|Works better then expected twice the cooling abilities of stock
B0044A9HYC|5|fast shipping great price
B00B22P3WA|1|This article only lasted one months in good condition , and then broke and disintegrated , I could not talk with the seller, I lost my dollars , really bad ...
B000IYU7PG|5|Arrived on time. Bolted right in place. Starter works like new!
B007DKQGQC|1|Of course the gun is pointing at the heart.
B008032QBA|5|Works great. Very satisfied with seller and Amazon.
B003L31RAU|5|Exactly what I ordered, Fit good and truck is running great.
B004VRJ9FU|5|Love these just perfect for my grandaughters room,smell just like baby power!
B0002JM69W|1|Would not buy this product again. Thought it was comfortable at first but, after sitting for a period of time the coils became irritating. It also didn't last long. The coils ripped through the mesh like fabric in less than two months.
B00GUDCVN0|5|Awesome. Liftgate on 2007 Tahoe stopped latching and stopped auto working. This fixed everything and was very simple to install.
B004XONSJ4|5|Works great and came as described.  I have a Derale deep transmission pan on my 2006 Dodge 3500 and didn't originally have this.  Its not needed unless you do a lot of steep climbing or on a slant (oil pickup can be compromised).  I ended up installing this thinking it might help a little with trans temperatures since it would be picking up from lower in the pan.
B0050NARPU|5|Beautiful product - Changed the feel of my truck overnight.  Easy to install as it's backed by poly instead of foam - so can bend and flex into position.
B0041DK44O|4|I've used this on wood and aluminum for various projects now and it give a nice texture finish but looked better on the wood than aluminum.  Perhaps I need to prep it differently than I did but overall I was happy with it.
B006GX08CU|4|They were shipped fast and did the job just fine
B004QJLEOM|5|It was perfect for removing the fuel cap on the outboard motor.
B00K9BFRSK|4|Nice size and easy to install. Well needed item for a wheel chair van.
B00042KG3A|5|Easy to use and easy to store under your JKU back seat if you do not have the mounting kit. I bought this for my husband for our Jeep and he loves it. Great price, great product. Solid construction and easy to use.
B0099M2RYC|5|Use this all of the time in our RV.  Works awesome!
B00DGRR6DI|5|Fit my 2003 RSX type S perfectly!
B0085LO2NW|5|This is so much easier (and faster) than using a chamois to dry my motorcycle. It makes a great leaf blower for the driveway and sidewalks too.
B010A9N7Z0|5|Super cool upgrade to our RV bedroom lighting.  the two settings, from real blue to reading light with a high kelvin is GREAT!!!!
B00D2QL0DU|1|Worked fantastically for one use with only water.  I tried to use it again yesterday and it won't suck up a drop.
B004VVNUVA|5|Love it.
B00H3LMDO0|5|Very satisfied
B00CBLW3EW|5|Works well in the RV and removing that coastal humidity
B000KIPA98|5|bought it for my granddaughter she loves it she wish u had the years on it but we solve that a permanent markers thanks
B001EOWR3Y|5|Bought for scooter carrier and ramp. Works great. Not too hard to insert, just need an appropriate wrench handy. Makes the rack wobble free and has stood up to some bumps fairly well.
B0002SA21W|5|Everything fit perfect! Quick & easy installation. Thanks!
B0016KA9PY|5|Works great!  I installed it in our motor home so we could haul our three large touring bikes with us on vacation.  We traveled up and down mountains from  central Texas to South Dakota without any problems!!  The price was great and I recommend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced trailer brake. (we ended up bringing four big bikes home)
B012Z8DCC2|5|very good product. Did read a 2001 Audi A6
B00N36OP7W|5|Holds the charge, great to take in boat just in case.
B004RNR9QY|5|Great hose at a great price
B0031I4HOI|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00KTHZJ1O|4|Good
B004YMRIC8|5|GREAT product. Gets behind calipers and cleaner very well... The fibers has not come apart yet or anything so I will keep Amazon buyers updated.
B001I3C9SY|5|This is the second vehicle I have purchased this product for ... and both times the cover arrived quickly and is working perfectly.  A great value.
B00K2SLS7O|5|Fit right in easy to install
B00OQ1F7PM|5|Great little trickle charger.
B000C9ULOE|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000VBA6ZW|5|This was exactly what I was looking for and is as described. LED is not super bright and is more of a diffused light versus a bright beam.  The switch does get a little warm with the light, but nothing to be worried about.  I use it to turn on my auxiliary transmission cooler.
B00BTGSGFK|4|Okay products.. IMO they should be $5 not $10 for 8...
B00B7SJIC0|5|Arrived fast, great quality, felt really durable.
B001C9E51S|4|Not the correct pulley
B0048SKOHO|5|Arrived on time and were very easy to install.  They are working well so far.
B001GN6L4Y|5|If you are building your own hitch and need a quality receiver tube - this is it! Made and designed well and welds good the hitch structure.
B00EQ1PVLW|5|haven't used yet but when I need it I got it  great price
B00NQ19AG0|5|Just as good as the brand name for less money. I love them.
B000BOALF4|5|Fast shipping a a good product
B00DBERI1Q|5|Worked great but I guess discontinued
B000VFZYAK|5|Good replacement for my tired m3 knob. It weighs more and looks pretty good. The knob will serve as a good place holder till I buy a zhp.
B002ZKEV44|3|Product worked out fine, but the pigtail plug in was falsly represented.
B004AIFK8A|4|pretty easy install
B0028JQYSS|1|Be extra cautious when using this Brand, after 3 uses, one of the 360deg wheels came off.  1st I noticed ball bearings rolling around the garage floor, then the nut & lock washer popped off as the wheel came with it.<br /><br />Not a good situation to be in when you are under the car.  Got out in time, no injuries.  But not worth the pennies saved considering the potential Health Bill you'll be paying.
B0002JMU2U|5|nice
B002P8SXLI|5|Very satisfied with product and service.
B000GU5IRY|4|Didn't work for my intended application, I'm but keeping it with my other spare parts because it seems well made.
B0096R06VG|4|No regrets with this purchase. I've ridden in below freezing conditions for two hours straight and if I had some wind brake, my fingers would have been fine.
B005GLNAFK|1|head too big for fixture opeing.  returned
B00EJVQ2X0|2|Meh. The smell wasn't that vanilla-y. Nor did it last very long. I like the clips because I could slide them into my central air vent perfectly, but without a lasting smell (of longer than 3 days) that is reminiscent of the scent it claims, this product is pretty useless.
B00F8FVLEQ|1|these Brake Shoes were too tight to fit the drum they claimed to fit. Ended up tossing them. Wasnt  worth the return shipping cost.
B005532BWW|3|Every thing work out great
B00C5RBRA8|5|Perfect kit, only down fall it wont fit in the bumper
B008BP0G1O|5|fits perfectly. I can really feel the horsepower with the sticker addition
B0027EUPFC|5|Exact fit for my pool. Nice product!
B00TQ07IOQ|3|Decent quality. Does not fit properly as stated in the listing. Highly disappointed. I drive a 2014 VW Bug and these floor mats are way too big.
B00KY09OA8|5|Perfect fit
B00279Z3T0|1|wrong part
B005N71YKU|5|LOVE IT
B005FLZ3SS|3|The product was not fully assembled and had marks on the chrome items and a scratch on the plastic above the Hyundai symbol location
B0093A9F4A|5|Fits the windshield of my 2004 Lexus ES330 perfectly.
B005345DBY|4|Essential for all-weather riding. Good quality/fit.
B00QK403SO|4|The packaging was not that good but the product arrived intact. They are just as good as oem wipers at half the price.
B009IKIB36|5|WORKED GOOD
B00H88E81Y|5|Love these they bring a nice look to my Xterra easy to install and very durable
B00ESBOL3E|5|I reckn this light bar is great
B004K0TJRG|5|Great fit and good quality.
B00PFHC15K|2|It tore at the seams really easily when a juice bottle fell over during a stop.
B00077ZDUS|5|Works as it should
B00XU8KRKC|5|Nice product and and customer service
B001KH7BMM|3|Only enough in bottle for two pumps.
B00HQJF52G|5|Perfect solution to eliminate your stubby antennae when going to stretched bags and fender. Thank you!!
B007TJXHZA|5|Got to me in 2 days and fits perfectly on my John Deere lt155.
B000KZ20HG|5|Good
B00RKV29LU|5|Restores power window operation to like new condition. Much cheaper than the big auto parts stores. The plastic sash pieces that come with these units are a great help because the original ones are usually broken.
B009Q0XVAQ|5|What an amazing tail light. It fits in the spot where the tail light goes and does all the tail light things a tail light is supposed to do. BEST. TAIL LIGHT. EVER!!!
B000BPSW7C|5|OK shipping time / nice product / i like it.
B00BVL7ZBY|5|It just works..
B007KPWBXC|5|thanx
B005I4DO5G|5|Fast shipping,  super easy install,  very bright even in broad daylight.
B00IIVUXLO|5|I got this Cargo Net to use in my Jeep GC Limited. It does not come with mounting clips but is the perfect size. Since it doesn't come with anything to attach it to the cargo area I also bought Nite Ize Size 3 S-Biner clips. The biner clips onto the existing rings in my cargo area and holds the cargo net perfectly. The way I have it setup the three openings of the cargo net are closed unlike the picture, which is fine with me and keeps everything secure.
B00IO98YJI|1|The pads produce much more brake dust than the factory semi-metalic pads.  Rims are black two days after washing which is totally unexceptible.
B000C2Q8FW|4|Be aware that you will need to purchase the required gasket / sealing washer for the discharge side for some applications (Certainly a 95 F Body LT1, likely others). This is Four Season's Part 24356. Every other compressor I've purchased before had this seal though admittedly were significantly more money. Other than that, it's an AC compressor - it seems to do what it's designed to do.
B0061R3HUG|5|Product was perfect and made for a comfortable ride on my 2012 Street Glide. Follow the directions and they are easy to install
B003G7Z8VK|5|pay attention everyone
B002NLLG02|5|Very Nice Plate. Looks nice on a black car.
B00LNIPBH0|5|Easy-to-use
B004GC4SOW|5|Fit was perfect on my 06 Escalade and it was easy to install
B00AL1KK9Y|4|The tent is good, but not trivial to fold up. I don't think I'd take this backpacking, but for car camping, it's good. I was worried the poles would break when folding it up, but they haven't. I've set it up and put away about 5 times, and taken one trip with it.
B00T36HLYU|5|I've used these a few times now, and they go on easy; come off easy; and there's no significant vibration in the mirror while driving.  All in all, very happy!
B004ZF3WII|5|great quality
B000C42RPK|5|Good shocks will buy again
B00G9CS4LU|5|Best deal I could find on this cap.
B009G9SGN4|5|Works great!!!
B00HPTDUTM|5|Exactly what my dad wanted
B00MGGDTNQ|5|Nicer quality than I expected.  Perfect!
B003LLRZLC|5|prefect fit for my air compressor and saved me about $ 30.00 over buying a new one.
B00T6J9TL2|5|Easy install looks great and good quality chrome part.
B00YWDCUOU|5|This works on a long driveway in a rural area.  It communicates clearly and picks up all incoming and outgoing traffic...both on wheels and foot.
B006YTMCFW|5|great decal can even tell it wasn't a factory ad on I have to point it out lol
B00NWS2Z5K|3|Wasn't an exact fit, particularly between the seat backs
B0007UC8VC|4|Good, easy install and shipped fast.
B0046I3I8I|5|Will help save my tires from the sun
B00GWWUJJW|1|Too bulky, wasnt the clean fit I was expecting.
B000COCRHI|5|had to modify slightly
B00VGOKCBQ|5|Great having Jack come along for the ride. Easy to install. durable.
B001RKH7FS|5|This is so nice to have for my husband who does a lot of traveling.  Keeping his drinks cold or his soup warm it works off the power outlet in your vehicle and is perfect for everyday or small trips.
B003LZ4IK4|5|works good
B00WW0LIOS|5|Works great. My husband loves it. Easy installment. Perfect for when we go off roading or when we just take a trip to the river not far from our house.
B008L17JRC|5|I like the lights !
B000E4B7SG|5|LOOKS LIKE ORIGINAL AND EASY TO REPLACE.
B00B0QWXW6|4|Works as promised. It's soft though so anyone that backed into you can dent your license plate so be aware of that. Ours is dented in the middle. Over all, pretty happy with it.
B00C873Y60|5|Hey, it's r134a at a good price in a recognized brand name. What else can I say?
B000C5PY1S|5|great price and product
B000BO22NS|5|Great oil ! The engine hasn't exploded yet and it's been almost 700 miles. Awesome engineering !
B00IDHFBWY|5|It was exactly as described and just what I needed.
B000E81VN8|5|Fit perfectly in my Equinox.  Well made.
B00F8KP9SA|5|Nice set works like a charm  no problem with this... Nice case
B0054RGGH0|5|Bought an OEM donut gasket off Amazon too and used them together to adapt my 3&#34; grimmspeed DP to my Cobb 2.5&#34; catback on my 07 WRX
B00VXFKGE6|5|Works as expected . No leaks Haven't had a problem yet but its only been a month or so.Would love to get at least 2 seasons out of it and it does look durable enough to do at least that.
B00ONDM07G|4|It's quite expensive, but I guess it's made specifically to fit perfectly in a Jeep Wrangler, so the price makes sense as it's not suitable for any other vehicles and is technically a custom design for us. The install was a piece of cake, but like most reviewers stated, it'll scratch your dash. The scratch will make you a bit uneasy at first, especially if it's a brand new Wrangler like mines was, but after a couple of weeks I completely forgot about it and you really can't see it unless you remove the mount. As for functionality, I guess I should have thought more about it before making the purchase; it is quite high and at an arms length away from the driver's seat.<br /><br />As a pure GPS mount, it's quite good (but I already have the uConnect GPS). As a dash cam type of mount, it's very stable, not shakey at all, and is directly in the middle at a very good height for a dead-on centered point of view. As a phone holder for changing music, it's quite far and your arm will get tired if you're looking through your phone for music or text messages (if you text and drive).<br /><br />Fit = 9.5<br />Quality/build = 9<br />Functionality = 7 (in my particular case)
B00SIBZR60|5|It right kind helpfull
B001AMA6OM|2|Very happy
B00DRZXRO6|5|Highly recommended! Helped keep the light out that was beaming in.
B0087XOTWW|4|Quick and easy
B00E4QHN0Q|2|I was excited about this sticker when I got it. Great price for what it is. However, I've only had it on my car for 3 months and it's already faded significantly. I removed it last weekend because it didn't look very good. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll look elsewhere for my sticker and I suggest you do too (at least if you plan to use it as a bumper sticker).
B00TOZONP0|1|The spacer itself is fine, however the stud is too small. IE the stud size is smaller than what's on the truck. So it doesn't work with my truck. Additionally the stock nut doesn't fit in the opening. So these do not fit a 2010 Chevy Silverado 1500.
B00PUY6FOQ|5|Perfect for my 2011 Ultra.  It looks more streamlined and much more a part of the bike now.  And I can use my bike cover without bending antennas or taking them off (over time, the bending will create a permanent bend in the antenna).  Met my expectations and more--great!
B00OQTFSHQ|5|Ships quickly - ultra high quality - bright LED
B0045WBVUM|5|Use this on at 2300 mile trip.  Loved it.  I have trouble getting comfortable even on my Mustang seat.  Adding this pad, at about 1/3 inflation, was perfect.  I highly recommend.
B00LG6GIQC|5|Great floor mats!  I bought them for my 2004 Grand Am, and they fit perfectly.  The original floor mats were getting pretty worn.  These will work a lot better - will very easy to clean, especially during our messy winters.  These are very sturdy, and I imagine I'll get many years of use from them.
B00Z515O5K|5|My previous set of jumper cables felt like I was picking up a small child, they were so heavy. The Jump Start It Cables are lightweight and are 12 feet long which truly comes in handy in situations where you have cars surrounding your car. The cables are easily color coded red is for positive and black is for negative which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't really know their way around the under the hood area of a car.  The clamps are firm but not difficult to attach to your battery.  These would make a perfect item to put in to a car for a teen going off to college or even a new driver so they are never stranded if they find themselves with a dead battery.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.  My reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinions.
B005EMHQ1A|5|it´s works well
B0012DKFEK|5|Fits about perfectly, and makes an amazing difference when parked in full sun.
B005DM5MX0|5|Quality As expected, delivery wait time too long.
B003GCSJAC|5|Just another tool for the tool box. Glocks, and small Batons
B007Y8IKMG|5|easy to install A+ works great !
B00A0OTOJE|3|Good.
B0002SR7TC|3|Works as advertised. The houses and connectors when used in warm engine oil obviously will deform shape. This makes storage of the varying house sizes a challenge. There is also no way to completely remove the lid which makes cleaning the interior tricky and time consuming.
B00M9NXUHG|4|Wanted one of these for a while before purchasing.  Seems to stir the dirt more than actually cutting into the ground.  works o.k. on small plots when soil is a little moist.  It is not going to take the place of a disc behind a tractor, but if you do not own a tractor, it is better than nothing.
B008VPUILC|4|just installed, reason for 4stars is that it was not disclosed that i would need a longer u bolt because of leaf size. time will tell preformance
B00GHTDGAO|4|Fits perfect on my odyssey  2001
B000HRAWEK|5|work great.
B0001EW4DG|4|We had to stick to the same stick on kind vs. the ones that go in the inside track.  The last set we had stayed on for over 10 years! - different brand. The plastic weakened over time - of course and pieces broke off with our last hail storm.  As we removed the remaining parts, a tiny bit of the paint came off therefore we had to stick to the same type of product.  So we'll see how long these stay on....
B00YHEIIQ8|4|Worked as described.
B0016LE80K|5|It works just fine, no issues with it.
B00EECLMWK|5|2000 Acura TL. Replaced the driver's side light in about 20 mins.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Exactly as advertised, does what it does.
B0014HLSA4|4|Good part
B004619X8E|4|easy install
B001B5INNO|5|unused condition, got a bargain
B00PS69DZE|2|The concept is great, but it does not work. The keys are stiff and don't slide in/out easily of the knob. More importantly, while turning the key prevents a person from unlocking, they do not actually lock the threads or anything. This fell off three times on my first off-roading trip since installing. If you are driving around town and your Hi-Lift is purely for the look then this might be for you. If you actually intend to go off-road, do not use this.
B000CFQMNC|5|Just as described.  Thank you!
B00JR2J0CG|5|Love these seatbelt covers. Looks very good
B0064MK44A|5|great product
B00W8ADB1K|4|The HangPro Car Organizer has 7 compartments that help our family hold everything we need for quick clean-ups and entertainment for our five kids.  It's small enough so that it's not in the way, and seems very rugged and durable.  My only suggestion for this product would be that it could use a little more support in the center to keep it from sagging forward.  However, it doesn't sag so much that it interferes with it's usefulness.  Overall, we found this product super useful.  It even inspired me to give my van an overhaul.<br /><br />*I received a sample product to review.  Opinions are 100% my own.
B00JBI9VHA|5|These are so awesome. they look great, they work perfectly. took me and my buddy maybe an hour an a half total time to install, did the grill at the same time. Sorry about all the dead bugs on my bumper, but these lights are sweeeeeeeeeeeeet! they are super bright too, even brighter than the stock lights. :)
B00BEN22BM|5|good
B00LAV2BVO|3|One coil failed after 24 hours of use (approx 100 miles driven). Otherwise working good enough to get a car with high miles down the road a bit longer.
B00GLLW3AM|2|These lights are bright and mount perfectly under the rear bumper of my truck. They are wired directly to the reverse lights with no need for a relay.<br /><br />However, one of the lights has condensation inside and its getting progressively worse. I even applied some silicon to the edges of the front bezel and where the wire feeds into it.<br /><br />For the price and light output you can't beat it. But the water getting inside makes it a deal breaker.
B00009PGNR|5|Excellent for running on solar in the household. No need to buy the adapter. Just install a 12v outlet off your home dc solar and presto! Also works well in the car. Keeps things nice and cool. Thank you, koolatron!
B00008RW9U|2|I have ordered several of these in that past and this is the only one that leave a layer of red residue on my car after each wipe, there is no static electricity on it at all or even the waxy substance that holds the dust which the others have had.  NOT impressed with this one at all. What happened people - summer help at the factory?  I have to use my old one after I use this one to pick up the red particle bits this one leaves.  I'm not sure if this one is a rare occurrence or if they are all being made this way.  I have been very happy with this type and brand of duster in the past, now I'm leary of ordering it ever again.
B00IO962L0|5|Perfect love them
B00JYMZ8HK|3|I assume it works, no way to really tell
B00L4H13HC|5|Excellent case for acura tl 1999
B00QULZ9G8|5|EXECELENTE
B00BXLSRIC|5|Excellent, was a gift for my wife, she loved it inmediately!!!! Tanks!!!!!
B0007RDVGQ|5|Worked great!
B001GMX9OK|5|product as described, no issues, great seller
B00AWE0FPE|1|They are not sturdy and were bending under the front forks. Bike fell off the front stand and I immediately requested a return.
B004NFXA7I|5|I personally think Aquapel works better than rain x and lasts quite a bit longer. We use these for all of our cars. During a white wash you are still able to see clearly without even turning on your windshield wipers. Definite stress reliever when the rain is really pouring.
B006ODSZ18|3|Its good but not great. The final adjustment to put the backrest up to my back needed a more precise feel. It was either to close or to far against my back . Also my wife and I don't like the Frankenstein look to all the expiaed hardware. But its inexpensive and kinda works
B007V2D1P6|5|Great quality product, fits perfectly on my 2015 wrangler. It helps a lot with the heat!
B000AMD18Q|5|Works well looks good.
B003BZD06M|5|As advertised
B00DHVOG8G|5|Exactly what was described
B005FCIEDI|2|Its fine - works ok - a bit expensive
B00K6498D0|1|This is one of the worst products<br />I have ever purchased.  Software supplied will not install on any computer I own and is dated to 2006 model year cars.  I downloaded other vag com software including Ross-Tech's lite version.  Still no luck.  Just a useless cable  Don't waste your money or time.  I spent hours trying to get it to work, more of a loss than the $12 bucks for the cable.<br /><br />Back to square one.  will investigate better options or go to dealer and pay big bucks to hook up my back up camera
B00BDVNE2Q|1|Price good. But if was mis-wired. After mechanic realized it and reverses polarity it works ok.
B00BNIOH84|3|Compact design, Easy pass fits well.
B0002SQYF0|5|Great for cleaning
B00AC8G64Y|4|I wish it was a little taller, but for the price I am very pleased. It's well made and installation was easy. It really cuts the wind compared to the stock screen, but only up to my eye level. If I wasn't 6 foot tall, maybe it would get up over my head.<br />I do like the looks, it fits the style of the bikes modern lines.
B002XM5G70|1|Pump is advertised as new and when I received it was wrapped in dirty plastic in a brown box, not the original box. The pump had a liquid in it and had been used. New units should be dry and now I must assume it's not sanitary to drink from?? It's supposed to be brand new. New pumps come in a new box and dry. I will not buy from this pump again.
B0040M30O2|4|made it easy to get a whole set
B00HX6P7YI|5|Works like a charm.
B002MQCYO0|4|Was recommended by the manufacturer for my windshield and seems to work well.<br />Time will tell.  Not the cheapest ,but buying a new windshield isn't cheap either.  And it<br />looks like it will last quite a while
B009QLBDSW|5|I hesitated because of the Cal-Hawk brand name, but don't let that disway you. This is a well made set and worth every penny.
B00H874928|5|Looks really good on my truck.
B00757JUOI|2|Looks good but gave poor reception on my radio stations
B00O8GXK8G|3|Would reviewed higher but when the decal was cut the paper under the decal was also cut which made it VERY difficult to remove.
B003BKRYTQ|5|it worked fine when it was installed.. after heavy rain the first led's burnt out..manufacture is replacing original product with new one..
B000BRJTZE|4|Took a little modification to fit but its sturdy
B00HUM5ME0|5|good fit
B00F4MQJ5O|4|Good light bar. Have to seal it up but really bright worth the money

B00BHD6HK6|3|Just ok
B00FSKSM5C|4|Descent quality. Worked for my intention.
B005JVFTTM|1|After only 3 uses, I now have to wiggle the cord around for it to work....I kept it safe &amp; always took the cord off before putting it back in its case.
B00ZG6JKUO|3|Not very random. The stickers were good, there was a wide selection. But its 100 stickers duplicated. Not 200 randomly selected stickers.
B00063X7KG|5|Worked as advertized on my '66 Tahoe Turquoise Thunderbird convertible and '69 black-on-black Stingray convertible.
B00NXRXNMO|4|These wipers blade assemblies are kind of funky looking, but installed easily and work well, so I'm happy.
B0024NWUCC|5|Easy to install. I can see at night again. Definitely would recommend.
B00R6S0MEI|5|These nozzles are extremely rugged and provide the level of control we need at our winery.
B002Y1VY30|2|Need to specify the states that can't use that license plate.  I live in Georgia and was unable to use it due to where we are required to place our sticker<br /><br />The license plate frame was what I expected
B0084F8LC2|5|I love it! And I didn't have to fight to get it on!
B004MSA3OY|5|Nice, clean looking tip...made a great edition to my old T-bird!
B000KC41FS|5|Great item.
B00RETZWQ2|5|Love it the look dope on my bike
B00DUTDZIC|4|It did not fit my 2014 Wrangler Rubicon exactly.  I needed to drill a couple holes for mounting but it is strong and low profile.
B00JA3BMDW|5|great product
B000CINFNY|5|perfect fit
B00D8RYGOI|5|Everything was as described
B000N9HZRY|1|After installing this pump,it worked in the driveway. After putting my boat into the water, it quit. VERY disappointed
B00HTOB0NG|5|My first set (Back in 2004 and from another company) would always flicker when turning on. When I went to Kensun products I purchased this item, and it eliminates all flickering. These are very easy to install and just plugs in to the Kensun Xenon Conversion Kits.
B00063X7KG|5|My car loves it. It takes the bird scat off my car effortlessly. It's also a great value on Amazon.
B00JCE5XN4|5|Great product and fast shipping!!
B001KR75N2|5|Easy install plugged right into harness
B00KCYLLNO|5|Great quality sticker, exceeded my expectations!

B0068C2K16|5|EXCELENTE
B00EN0E7NO|5|Came fully assembled. Installed alone in 5 minutes. Could not ask for more. A+++
B000B8JUNY|1|It is no good
B00GHT8CXK|4|Great replacement part
B005ZZOEUM|5|As described. It fit and worked.
B002NAS052|4|Fits perfect. Didn't have any problem putting it in. Now headlights are clear.
B00ZVJ38XQ|3|We needed a new seat cover set after years of kids and 2 over-active dogs! When I was able to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review I knew it was time to get rid of the old set. It took two of us to get this new set on and after two days, here are my thoughts.<br />Pros:<br />This is a complete set which includes the seat covers, head sets, a steering wheel cover and seatbelt covers<br />Two tone color, making it more attractive than an one color set<br />I like the fact that there are seatbelt pads for the backseat as well as the front<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very time consuming installation with strength of two people needed to get the pieces on correctly<br />The bench seat must be lifted way up, or removed completely, to install the cover<br />Rear seat belts need to have the cover cut in order to be pulled out, easy to see where people may cut before properly fit and therefore need to cut it again<br /><br />For whatever reason (mine or the design) I have had to refasten the back seat three times, each times there were people sitting there! Since this has been a pain, it caused me to drop the rating down to 3 out of 5 stars.
B00407V4F4|3|I can see little different shade with this.
B003P9YPRC|5|Great part
B0068WS2XG|5|Put one on each side window of the jeep
B0031I808M|5|Happy
B001EIWC8A|5|Perfect fit met all specs.
B000B5QFE4|5|They worked great, was able to see around my 33' travel trailer much better than before.  There was no wobble or shake.
B00407YQ04|5|Bought this to repaint some 97 Ford silver rims and it worked great. Remember to sand, prime, and clear coat too.
B001UCCNEI|5|Fit like a glove.
B001NZ6FSW|5|Works great! Comes prefilled with enough oil for the whole job! Comes with correct seals also. Read instructions before installing.
B0006JLW4S|5|Vinyl trim was an exact match to replace my weather stained trim around the three storage bins. The trim was used by my manufacture to cover the door's installation screws. Tip: Use a blow dryer to heat the vinyl and make it pliable  enough to bend into the retaining grooves. Manufacturer should have said that rather than our trial and error😀
B006YXVRUE|5|Good product. Was shipped quickly.
B004809YBE|5|I always have this with me and use it at home but never camping.  That is until this weekend, 90° and high humidity, the outlet went out at my campsite, the breaker would not reset.  I was able to hook into the next camp site over and not move the trailer.  I would definitely recommend a 50' cord to anyone who is going camping.
B001C6N6YI|3|Gasket for manifold bent in three places but a arrived  on time.
B00IK21RFW|2|Did not cover well was disappointed
B000CP8N5M|2|Beware if its in a product box there will be missing parts namely the washers. One came in a bag the other in a box . verry frustrating !!!!
B008899HSG|5|Looks good on a computer, as advertised.
B000CIPUU0|5|Quick shipping, great price!
B00L39VJY8|5|Pretty good product. Almost more silver than black, but they look pretty good. Quick service.
B00062ZORG|1|these are tiny, will not work with a normal size hood pin
B00SISKEIY|5|Nicely styled, heavy grade metal.<br />As near as I am determine, an exact match to the original.
B002FE3VLE|5|it was just what  i wanted . it was a good price and it arrived when they said that it would.
B00WGCOINK|5|Direct replacement for my old bulbs and priced right.
B0081SAY1S|5|This starter is a direct replacement for the stock starter on a silver top RB20DET!<br />The same in every way including wiring.<br />I am very pleased with the starter and it saved me a lot of money vs. buying one from a specialty online seller.
B00UV78Z18|5|Got these guys in yesterday.  I received them at a discount for an honest review.  These lights have some good weight to them.  The fins run deep for added cooling.  I hooked them up directly to the battery and they are very bright, even in the middle of the day.  They come with a small mounting bracket that I don't plan to use.  I plan on cutting holes in my bumper and mounting them flush to the rear bumper.  These are going to make the perfect work lights.  I will run them to an auxiliary switch to use when backing up to trailers.  I can't wait to get them mounted and wired.
B001TNR63G|4|works well.
B0006IX850|5|Works really well.  Tube is flexible enough to reach down the bend in the filler pipe of my campervan.  Shut off valve is solid, and can be used to continuously adjust flow rate.  Nice!
B000SZUMQY|5|love it.
B007IQ58UG|5|My husband LOVES this polish!! Excellent results everytime!!
B0010E1LY4|5|It is working just fine.
B00CO045AU|4|As described. fast shipping.
B00VULOB2Q|5|The frames are good quality.  They were mailed very quickly and easy to put on my car.  Great value too!  You basically get 2 frames for the price you would normally pay for just one.  Definitely recommend.
B0043063JU|5|I use this on my back patio so my kids don't slip on the concrete slab after swimming.
B00T6B53HO|5|Love it...I have matching lips  decor on my truck.
B00A7B7QJA|5|easy install,great fit, stopped my leak,great product for my 1988 wrangler
B00PCME822|5|Factory filter, form fit and function perfect.  It is not worth it to me to save a few dollars and get a no name brand filter.  I feel the engine is designed around using this filter so why risk it for a few dollars.  Never had a problem with these so I see no need to use anything else.  Would buy again
B00OZXDDS4|4|look good
B00KTIXICK|5|GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN BEAT IT.
B0010GAZOE|5|Of course with an ACDelco part, it fit and functioned perfectly and my customer was happy and back on the road in no time.
B00A6GG5KC|5|Doesn't come with instructions but once you have them in they look GREAT!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|they work great
B00IQFE2O6|5|Great product!
B00480GZ8O|5|Great Product
B00XM5RN5K|5|Better than expected.
B00V4049K2|5|Definitely noticed a good difference after a few days. Two weeks later my car still smells fresher
B00IM6UMKC|5|OEM plug at great price---
B00JJ6DN1O|5|Fast delivery, good product
B000CQVWTA|1|Lousy rotors....knew they are a American company but made overseas(import junk)..happy showed up quick but that's about it...couldn't get them to fit on without rubber mallet (not hitting rotor pad surface)......once one they didn't run true, back off and shipped back to amazon and cancelled the fronts I ordered before they shipped....ordered  the &#34;dura&#34; brand and fit like a glove
B00G0DYIVS|5|Good product, bright and nice color. It gave a new life to the interior of my car.
B000XEBI9K|5|I hate when people drive around with these things out but I like it overall. The only thing that kinda sucks is if you have a lot of stuff in your trunk you will have a hard time flipping it in and out - but that's your fault not the product's. The sucky thing is, if a) people knew how to park properly and show some courtesy or b) everyone had one of these (or a bumpshox on the front) there would be no need for this product. It sucks that we have to buy this kind of stuff but if you live in the city it's the cost of owning a car.
B00407V70G|3|Expected it to be shinier.
B00SXIB8KW|5|wonderful vibrant colors and shipping was fast came from Greece and in an envelope awesome
B000IZSB2Q|5|You just insert into your fresh water tank & walk away if you want. This makes filling your fresh water tank SO much easier! You don't have to stand there holding the hose to fill.
B0002SR8AK|5|perfect tool for product
B000SOIRCG|5|Used this to successfully remove water and crap from 9 year old diesel before using it in a home oil water heater.  No issues.  Good investment.
B001URVKEC|5|great
B00BFDG4QU|5|great gas cap. no issues so far and click into place firmly. seems like a very robust, high quality cap and seems pretty original. highly recommended!
B0055O6RMQ|2|Installed them myself. But the nuts and bolts always come off when i put up the window. They still stay up though lets see for how long.
B009A186Y2|5|Items were packaged well.  Products look gorgeous on my CTS!!!  I was very pleased with these products how they fit on my car. And especially how they look on my car!!!  The only thing i would say is that it doesn't come with an outer perimeter seal.  The lights themselves are sealed but the perimeter of the lights aren't sealed.  You have to use the stock rubber seal and that doesn't work too well.  But other than that good product!  Thank you!!!
B00L7E80IW|1|A box of .99 cents tissue paper is better quality this this.  Better off going to the dollar store.  Horrible quality and definitely NOT the original tissue that the Tempo came with.  Save your money and purchase some Kleenex.
B00BITIV8U|5|Arrived within a week, and ended up being a better quality than the handle the car came with! My husband did have to remove the entire door to install the handle in our car, but he said it wasn't difficult. Just tedious. All around I am extremely satisfied.
B00AO4QP3S|5|Good
B00K8HXGH4|5|Absolutely stunning! My daughter placed this on the back of her car window and looks great!
B008DREON6|5|everything is fine
B000COCUF2|5|THESE BULBS WILL HAVE LONGER LIFE AND WONT FADE AS TIME PASSES.SOLID COLOR AND WORKS AWESOME.
B00M0CBV9U|5|We read all packing and install instructions. Packed bag and strapped to crossbars. Heard noise as we got on highway. Checked bag and saw we had a crease on the front of bag. Went through sun roof and pulled crease out. No more noise. Hit a very heavy rain storm. Worried about cargo, mostly pillows, sheets, large dog beds and other soft stuff. When we arrived at our destination, took bag down and checked cargo - all was dry. We were very pleased. Think the most important thing was we read all material with product and knew what to look for when we first heard the noise and made sure to have logo toward back. We've had hard case roof carrier and tailgate carrier. Roof bag is the most simple and secure.
B00KTHZ8CY|5|finally the correct size for my Lexus RX 350 2008.  took it my local ace hardware store to cut it for me.
B00LEBLI82|5|Quick delivery and items were as described. Happy.
B00F8MJBOQ|4|My husband uses this in his truck (truck driver) to keep the seat cooler.  He likes it, but the bottom part slides forward.  I'm going to sew a second strap or something to the bottom half and hopefully that will work.  That was the only issue though!
B00FJX8DXY|5|Rags vary in size and shape. All rags are white.  They are good for cleaning glass, and plastics. Good deal, I would buy it again.
B001U60T9U|5|Exelent
B000COB5MQ|5|Perfect for my issue with my truck.
B00OO1GVOA|5|Very satisfied
B003V0GG18|3|cute but not super useful.  must empty fastidiously or run out of room.
B002M3KSK0|5|Used this on our Volvo XC60 to keep luggage top on the car.  Worked great!  Good value for the money.
B000PWV19C|5|Excelente fit, sound and performance
B002E5HMT6|4|Not the same quality as the original equipment, but for a vehicle with 200,000+ miles it was more than adequate. Price was much more affordable. It matched right up to original mounting location without a problem. It might have taken twenty minutes to replace it and I was up and running again.
B00DP46AAM|2|I took this to the dealer to have the key cut but they were unable to program the keyless features. I would not get this product
B00FGR8XF6|4|Small, and kinda cheap. They look cool, and if you dont pay much you get what you pay for.
B002WHABHQ|5|excellent.  perfect fit.
B00YC177B8|5|They do what they're meant to, and they're blue. What more do you expect?
B00INCGQTG|1|The front rotors weren't bad. They fit fine. The brake pads are very poor quality and are not holding up well at all! Also there are no clips with The pads so I had to use the old ones. The rear rotors they sent were for a different vehicle! I will not but from this company again!
B00NIA4WCQ|4|Looks slick on my indicators
B0060LTNDS|5|Have had them on my car for a few months now. Still working great no leaking. Changes the whole appearance of the vehicle. Fits like factory possibly better.
B0058DIDTY|5|Love this stuff. I use it to wrap everything and it looks so professional looking
B00XTY2CHI|4|Like them  wish  they had red to
B004RNSO2M|5|Liquid gold!  My car told me it likes!
B001DBZUF0|5|Didnt fit but lookrd nice
B00ITYPKO0|5|Exactly what I expected. Definitely an improvement over my old faded emblems.
B00D8WHI8O|1|i bought 2 sets of these valves, after a month one of the valves that i gave to a friend as a gift failed and released the air. two month later valve failed on my car. Visibly i could not see any damage to the valves. On both tires the release was rapid. I do not recommend them.
B004BTF3M6|5|It's a GM headlight dimmer switch and it works just fine. This switch probably fits a couple hundred different cars (mine went in a '68 Pontiac Tempest). Mine managed to disappear somewhere inbetween projects on the car, so for just a couple bucks I picked up a new one. It connected right to the stock harness and the holes matched up to mount on the floor. The switch has good, solid action and a very audible and tactile click response.
B00N49I3O4|3|For the price I got this set for, I am overall happy with this set. Fit is pretty good, with the exception that they are slightly too tight and I can't get the underside of the top parts of the front row covers to reach the velcro on the backside. While it does not seem like they will come loose, only time will tell. Also, when putting on the first cover, a side pocket ripped slightly so I am a little concerned about the long term durability. Other then that, they look and fit pretty good and are priced right. I will say some of the descriptions/pictures provided by this seller are inaccurate for this specific item. The color is black by the way.
B000C5WD08|5|It fits perfectly!
B001MTRIB2|5|Works perfectly, inexpensive. Put in a 1997 Civic.
B004A6JA2O|5|It works fine .
B0024GQ1AG|4|suprizingly confortable
B010GW2TGE|4|It was tough to apply, mostly because of how slim the outline is. Other than that, exactly what I needed, great for my laptop!
B00RNJPXEO|4|Product came in perfect condition. Light weight and assembled quick and easy!
B007PL1EWA|4|I love it it's perfect on my red hyndai accent!
B00RVATBUC|5|Very bright and was delivered fast. Everything you needed to mount the light came with it.
B005ASY23I|5|It is very useful and can inflate an almost fully flat Nissan Patrol tire to its specs in a jiffy. I am considering to purchase another one to be carried with the Grand Starex, trouble is the price and the cost of delivering the item to the Philippines.
B00FJDL0J8|5|Does what it promises and with zero odor. A little goes a long way and looks amazing! People ask me what I used to make my trim, tires and dash look so &#34;juicy&#34;...
B00N77WSDA|1|The rubber bands broke not even a month after i put them on (both side)...  I would love to get more rubber bands
B000CPI5Z0|1|I bought this at Oreily auto parts because of the rave reviews. I thought there was a chance it would help a very small miss in my Honda Ridgeline. I mixed the bottle in a full tank of gas and ran the whole tank as low as I could. Never noticed any improvement. Now the next tank of gas and all I notice is that the miss has gotten substantially worse and so has my MPG. Maybe this is all coincidental and I probably have a bad coil pack or something but this stuff along with seafoam and techron do NOTHING for ANY vehicle I have tried them in that was fuel injected. Seafoam has helped a carbureted lawnmower engine run smoother but that's a whole different thing.  Don't waste your money thinking this kind of stuff is going to do magic.
B001KZFEVY|1|.No Not original Airtex
B0009IR056|5|Fit my tractor.
B000AMOEGY|5|I haven't used these yet... But I have use Victor plug tool before & liked them
B007453K9C|4|Yep, works, good price.
B007VRC8DW|5|Item has worked very well. It was shipped to me quickly and very happy with the product and service I received. I use roll bar pads on equipment at work so I do not bang my head on equipment that I have to reach in to get the product out.
B00R1FIWXY|5|This starter worked great im totally happy.
B00ES5Q63S|5|These provide a great wipe.
B00P8E2L2I|5|When I first received my steering wheel, it was not the color I had wanted. This company worked with me for over a month, by corresponding with me through email with pictures. We eventually arrived at a color that matched my interior, and I couldnt be happier with this company and my steering wheel!
B00NXRXGO4|4|They work great !!
B011M66G5I|3|Overall quality was excellent, but the bottom strap at it fullest extension did not wrap around the lower portion of the front seats in my 2012 Toyota Tacoma.  I would have given 5* if it had fit.  I'm returning for refund.
B003Y8L6OO|1|Really like the gel palms...NOT....if there was any! Very disappointed!  Sewing was poorly done. One hand fit, the other had excess material, and was sewn crooked in a wavy manner. I would love to send them back!
B00K0OFSUS|5|Just got this today. I needed a bumper to haul my trailer for my quads. First impression- it's very well built roughly 53# and looks like it will last. Mine did come with all the bolts unlike some others have experianced. I also have the nerf bars to match from Tyger and they do pack them lose in the box. I can see how they could get lost. Installation was simple my son and I had it in in less then a hour. There is NO need to drop the tank in a YJ. It is rough getting the inside Bolts on but a little patience and luck they do go on. It held me and my son both of us are over 6ft and 200 plus each bouncing in it and don't flex or budge. Well worth the money.
B000X25Y1U|5|Great deal!!!!
B003VAWO8M|5|The longer cable was what I needed and was easy to wire into the electrical box on the trailer. Everything worked like it should.
B00O5E4PEO|3|Price seems a bit steep for it. All plastic. Seems kinda flimsy. Front is high gloss like a mirror.
B00KY0ND7I|5|It starts.
B00EVMT6A8|3|It work but the image is too small.
B005ETQ650|5|as advertised
B009DJSSXU|4|Excellent nock off.
B0058PN7WU|5|great
B005DUN08Q|5|Great stuff, will order this again.
B00P82P8AM|5|This should have came pre-installed with the car.  It looks clean, and protects from rocks and debris
B00SK12GKS|5|Awesome windshield! Does everything they say it does, highly recommend! Great customer service!
B004RNR9QY|1|very dissappointed.  I ordered two of these as a gift for my husband.  The end metal nozzle came off of one the first time used.
B00S1EONGO|3|It's about half an inch longer than the original Honda part for the 2015 Honda Fit, but it'll fit by just pushing the lid a bit.
B0030MNMTG|5|Cleaned both &#34;no clean flux&#34; and rosin flux similar to the  Flux Off  I used as a professional.  Smells better too.
B001AGJ4RS|4|So far, so good. Working fine. Will be nice if gaskets and hardware be included for a reasonable extra.
B001KSGIKM|4|Fills in the bass and sounds great. The old ones were blown by previous rental car drivers.
B00HE4Y1S2|1|rusting badly. not worth the money. will have to replace.
B000AMLWH8|5|Has a funky smell but cleans and protects without a nasty greasy feel. (Armor all) just clean.
B006MIWA6Q|5|nice fit as expected matches top
B000LEPT5G|5|Arrived quickly and gives you codes just like it's supposed to. I got it for my 2006 Charger (which is always having problems).
B0088OO4RK|1|2007 bmw 335i 3.0L 6cyl.E90/N54 is tht right?
B000WJAH5M|5|Easy way to add cushioning and size to stock grips.  Even works well with my heated grips on the Concours 14.
B00JDHQN6G|2|This bracket with the attached mirror does not have enough range of motion either up and down or side to side. I should have bought the other model.
B001AJH1HK|5|Great build quality. Should fit most mirrors easily.
B00KGN6WCQ|1|The white turned tan after three days.  BTW this car is garaged half the day.  I thought it would fit the hood and trunk on a '05 3 series but it only fits the hood.
B006G2MJZU|4|Great piece
B003CMIH2Q|5|This sticker looks great on the car window. It peels off the paper exactly the way it should and the material feels very durable.
B00096S214|4|Nice stool. What I expected. Only reason I gave 4 stars was it does have slight wobble to it nothing major but perfect for the price
B00S1M5L0S|4|Delivery on time. Quality product. Some confusion on my part about the stripe design. The advertisement says these Rally stripes are for the 2014 and 2015 Chevy Silverados. Which, is true, these stripes do fit these Silverados. However, they are not the new Rally stripe design that Chevy is currently installing from the factory. Shame on me for not recognizing the difference right away. I was truly disappointed to discover the design difference after I had already installed this older design. Hopefully, Custom Auto Design will point out the design differences in their future advertisement presentation. Note: CAD did offer a refund only if I returned the old design Rally stripes. CAD also stated that nowhere in their advertisement did they state the design offered is Chevy's new factory design. Beware, you be the judge
B008G3A67A|4|lights are as good as oem for quality and fit. you could no tell any difference other than cost was more reasonable than oem
B00S6B2RHO|1|I THINK IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK, THAT SHOULDN'T BE SOLD.
B00KA4NFGW|5|Great Transaction, Just as Described, Quick delivery, A++++
B00NJYE2HG|3|I was originally looking for the hatchet girl but didn't see her until after my purchase. The item is awesome!
B009AQS5JS|5|Looks amazing on a bright red sports car (when paired with the screw/nut covers).  Is REALLY reflective.  When following or pulling up on this, it looks like it's lighted like a tail light.  I followed my car with my wife's, and this looks great during day and backlit at night.  I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that the end caps (sold seperately) are as reflective as this border.  Being so small, I was skeptical.  I bought two sets of the ends so I'd have spares if they fell off.  I've had this on for over 3 months, and it looks like they'll all hold.  You'll probalby need an optional mounting frame if you want to use all for holes.  No regrets.  Looks great.
B00KBQB1SS|5|I just got my order yesterday I'm really happy with my fuel tools every do it yourselfer need this set its well made free s.h it only cost me 4.34 it was a little bit of a wait on delivery because it came from China thank u
B0082ARSBY|2|Overpriced, poor fit, poor quality.  If you want this low of quality and poor fit just go to a local store a one size fits all cheapo for $20.  Some of threads came loose before I even put the seat covers on, fortunately I'm quick with a needle and I fixed the area with minimal effort; but for the price I paid I shouldn't have had that problem.<br /><br />I thought &#34;I'm going to spend money to get a quality product with a great fit,&#34; the fit is marginal at best.  The front passenger seat keeps slipping forward and towards the center council.  Because it visually skews the orientation of the seat you feel like you're sitting down crooked when you get in the vehicle.  The quality was significantly lower then my expectations, its extremely permeable.  The seat covers only protect my seats from UV rays and crumbs, any liquids would soak right through.
B000C9QPKS|5|Mine are PRC made, but are clearly marked Toshiba.  Not sure if that makes them good or bad, but they are Toshiba made, unless counterfeit.
B0068MZJT6|2|It showed it fits my car but 98 avalons don't have indoor cabin air filter
B000CB1MS6|1|I was disappointed because I expected to received two boots as a kit. the steering pinion rack uses two boots.
B00U8O69AS|1|My copy was defective. Had to return, oh well.
B00F5MU5YY|5|Our camper has very little water pressure where we are set up, I purchased this hoping for a miracle! I have very thick long hair and it was impossible to wash with the original shower from manufacturer,  I installed this upon arrival and was so excited that it works wonderful!  Yes it does run a small stream of cold water when in off position but I face it toward the shower wall, no big deal. Love it!
B000O51VJ0|5|Awesome little fire when you can't have a wood fire.  Works like it says it does.  Compact, easy to carry, hook up, use and store.  I like it, I still like real wood camp fires best, but this works.
B00V7DRP5M|5|Stainless steel braided silver line hose can be used for many purposes such as fuel, oil and gas transfer. If you think about what this used to transfer, it is kind of obvious that these are some dangerous liquid/gas that should be handled carefully. Now this is the main reason why you should buy this hose.<br />Design of this hose is well thought. Basically outside of the hose is stainless steel braided. This outside feature is very important. Especially in application of racing fuel, pump gas users of this have to drag the hose. so if the hose get leaked it will be a big problem. Also to avoid rust this hose is stainless steel. In that way not only this is safe to use, this can be used for a long period of time. Inside of the hose there are two layers. The outer layer is 304 stainless steel wire and the middle layer is 304 stainless steel wire mesh sleeve. After these two layers there is a CPE synthetic rubber which is the core of the wire and through this fuel will be transferred.<br />This 304 stainless steel wire is about 5 feet long. Inner diameter of this about 0.22”/5.56mm and the outside diameter is 0.44”/11.18mm. This hose weight about 6.1 ounces and the product dimension is about 8 x 1 x 8 inches.<br />This hose’s working pressure is 1000 PSI / 69 Bar and the burse pressure is 6000 PSI / 420 Bar. Operating temperature of this hose is -40 degree F to +350 Degree F. As you can see this hose is made to resist extreme heat, abrasion and corrosion. Also this offers superior flexibility and bending with maximum vacuum service.<br />If the length of the hose is too much you can cut the hose using a cutting wheel/ hack saw or a steel braided hose cutters. Also you will need a duct tape or electrical tape. First you have to measure the desired length you need and then tape the hose at measured length needed for application. The cut hose threw the tape you have placed and then remove the tape. After that slide one end of the hose into end of fitting and insert the other half of fitting into the hose and begin to push and screw the fitting together. Make sure that all connection are tight and then it’s ready to use.<br />Likewise there are many advantages and benefits that can be gained from using this hose. This hose is made using quality materials to make sure that this is 100% safe to use and there are many customers who are happy with this product. Also if you can use it with care you will be able to use this for a very long time and you won’t have to replace this time to time because of leaks and rust. This comes with a very good length so you can cut it and get the necessary length. There are many thing you can observe in the product and this can be called as one of the best product in the market.
B00KL3ALGO|2|These came and were not as good as I was expecting. Barely darker than my already tinted windows.
B000C7XQB6|4|Easy replaced, fixed code issue.
B002OH8EVO|4|works great
B00CIYH6FI|1|I am very disappointed that here it is a few months later and the switch needs to be replaced again.  Left turn works great, right turn does the rapid clicking and no light action that the original did when I replaced it.<br /><br />As it is too late to return to Amazon, I'm going to have to eat the cost on top of taking apart the steering column again.<br /><br />Not happy.
B000T2W336|5|Glad I can still find these around, so I can re-use my 15 yrs old rack
B00GM4UUZS|5|a nice soft carrier. plenty of straps to attach to roof rack. thin material, good price.
B00TQPS23W|4|WORKS FOR ME....I HAVE AN ELECTRIC FRONT WHEEL & KEEP IT ON BOARD &USING WITH ONE OF THE 12v BATTERYS W/12v CLIP ON CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTER.....WORKS LIKE A CHARM
B00KN0UOEE|5|Great for ceaning the kayak.

B00I2JHNR4|5|Fits like a glove in 2013 CX5. Identical to OEM filter
B007JMOY22|5|No problems worked great.
B00YG6ZCVQ|5|WILL IT FIT THE BMW 650 I 2012?
B00W63X0LA|5|Great quality!  Just like the real deal only smaller.
B0083Z2S7M|5|Unable to turn right due to arm injury. This will assist during recovery process.
B003CJ95V6|5|Clearly I can see it working!!
B00NAV1Y3I|3|It works, but nowhere near as bright as my previous light. I intend on finding another LED to compare and hopefully it's better/brighter... SAFER!
B00URH56CI|5|I just installed them today and they did fit into my base on my Audi TT. I am including pictures to show the difference. I love how bright they are!! The left is stock and the right is the led. In the pictures it shows up almost a neon yellowish color but it is still amber but really bright. The last two pictures are both the led lights.
B00FRHOJYE|1|I'm not sure if they changed something or what these didn't work well at all! They just seemed to smear the rain around and not give you a clear view of the road. I'll be looking for a different brand for my next pair!
B00V3PWPYU|4|returned cause i accidentley ordered 2 but it looked good.
B00IZAJMLK|5|excellent product
B00KHUQGGA|3|This product sheds black lint For a while my light blue dress shirt was full of it! Thats wy the 3 star rating.
B0011TXE48|5|Works great thanks
B00AKFXNAO|4|Pretty good, but my handlebars periodically slip a little.  I need to find a good way to fix that.  The product could be better if the smooth mating surfaces were ribbed like they are on the handlebars.
B0065FRBZ6|5|Love it
B00837Z4L2|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B000FQ7QJM|3|Fit wasn't as good as the original one, but for an 19 year old vehicle it'll do.
B001AGLAFC|5|No complaints worked awesome
B0006FKDVK|5|I used this on my chrome running boards on my truck with the Griots 3in polisher and orange pad, and also with a microfiber towel. The results were great, it removed mild water spots and oxidation that I was not able to remove by washer or with OPC. I would definitely buy this product again.
B00CMY2XJI|5|The product was exactly as described.  It arrived on time. I love it. Thanks will order again from vendor.
B00164RJCG|1|Color does not match MB Blue.  The decorative cover is glued and 2 of them fell off with 2 hours of driving.  Concerned that the rest will fall off at the car wash anytime.  Spend the extra money and get MB Parts from the dealer.  Tried to get refund but offered replacements from seller, which will likely have the same problem.  Very disappointed with this purchase.
B012X4Q2VG|5|Item arrived as advertised. Fits well the track. Beautifully packaged and at a great price. Will bookmark this page to purchase more when needed.
B007OW6MD6|3|These do what they're supposed to do and fit properly.
B00AMPP25G|1|Didn't fixt what i need.  I lost $40 dollars to return this item.
B000C9LNWS|5|Worked great as all oem parts do.
B001KRH71W|5|Worked really well, didnt line right up on my 95 Jeep Wrangler, but a bit of fab work and it fixed my overheating problem, and looks great from the front. A cheap and quick fix that will last a long time!
B000E9VGNM|4|Pretty cool. Works pretty well
B00GSAUHB8|5|Bottom line: high quality prodcut worth buying<br /><br />The Shade-it windshield sun protector is easy to open and put up. I love that it also came with a bonus gift of a sticky type of that I can place anywhere in the car to hold my phone up, or other accessories. The windshield shade protector is flexible and can easily be folded back up and put into the little bag it comes with. There's a strap that secures and holds it in place. It helped keep my car cool and my seats and interior from overheating. The windshield protector material is made well so I don't have to worry about the material breaking, or tearing after a few use.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
B001EOV492|5|Works just as intended.  I love Curt Products.
B00496GUC8|5|Great
B000GG1IHC|4|These are SO nice to have on the bumper. This one came to me fast and in good shape. It had a bit of a &#34;crimp&#34; in the middle but I think it's not going to matter at all when I get it installed.
B000GZPH2U|3|This is not the first CrampBuster I have had, but I am very disappointed that the rubber band that holds it in place is oozing what I suspect is plasticizer.  First, this is not healthy to get on your skin.  Second, the CrampBuster does not stay in place like it should because of the slimy ooze.
B008HU853Y|5|Really nice!!
B005OVD2AU|5|Graphics were a little different from OEM, but the fit and function were perfect.
B000E300OE|3|This reservoir works very well as a replacement in my older motor home.
B00RNITVCU|3|they were ok not much room to adjust. with wind guard.
B000BYB1Y4|5|Great fit for my 93 Suburban!
B00WQHMMVK|1|Zipper broke on the first day.  stitching and materials are cheap, won't last long.
B00CU4J6KE|3|The quality of the item, as far as materials, is high. However, the screen left too much gap around the rearview mirror. There was also a noticeable gap around the lower corners. I ordered the gold color screen to match the car - which is tectonic silver. The screen is an odd shade of gold and the finish is matte. I was expecting a color that was a more subtle gold, with a tiny bit of shine. I returned the item and went with the Intro-Tech windshield screen. I had one for my Focus (which I loved) and thought I'd give the Covercraft a try. If you're undecided, go with Intro-Tech.
B009IJQ8HS|2|I've had two of these and won't buy a third. Neither lasted a full season of camping with only intermittent use. While I appreciate the compact size, both hoses sprung leaks after just a few uses.  I bought the second hose thinking the first one was just a bad sample.  But the second hose was no better. I attribute this to the poor quality of the woven material. I previously owned another brand of a similar hose and it lasted a decade. It will kink if you don't shape it into a series of large radiuses. Also, it has to be completely straightened out in order to drain it. But that wasn't a problem once you know the technique. The poor quality of the hose however, makes this a product I would not recommend.
B0038EPGC2|5|Came in just in time for my fathers birthday and he loved it! The reflective metal is pretty sick too! Great product!
B000MPQKXY|1|The center caps do not fit ITP Delta steel wheels 4/110.  I would rather buy a set of caps that fit my wheels than pay the shipping to return these.
B0023VKVV2|5|looks like original, easy install
B000CFOJ96|5|Easy install, perfect fit, work great! Two thumbs up!
B00NQ19AG0|5|We bought a Yakima Skybox and a set of 58&#34; crossbars and 4 RailGrab towers. I wanted a 6-pack of lock cores so that the towers and the cargo box would all be keyed alike. These ZeLock cores are great quality, easy to install and the company quickly answered my questions about how to remove the original lock cores. Thank you!
B00265M9SS|5|Pretty damn impressed. Easy, simple. Does the job.
B0028PJ10K|5|These work just like they said they would.  Love the interlocking capability, makes it easy to drive up onto and off of them.  Easy, quick leveling of our motor home
B00IO95B8K|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B00WGU0UCU|5|Protects the floor under and to the side of my boot.  Excellent design
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Good
B0049CM1LG|5|Easy install on my 2004 Jetta TDI.
B0006Q7H36|5|This stuff work's great!
B00407XAIS|5|Absolutely love this color I love the difference it made and how the color came out! You really can never go wrong with gun metal grey paint!
B002OVI9JC|5|Perfect, easy to use, and did what they stated.
B00N6D7K38|5|very nice
B00KZD8ME8|5|I am not the most technically proficient guy but after spending 5 minutes installing the first one, the second one took less than a minute to install. What I found worked: Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the housing. Use your nails to separate the lens cover from the rest of the unity. While pinching the two metal clips on either side, use the flathead screwdriver to press down on the pushpin connector. Tug very gently to release the connector. Plug in the new light and pop in back into the door, making sure the emblem is oriented correctly.<br /><br />This certainly adds a unique and classy look. Not visible during the day but shines brilliantly at night
B009TAWAFU|3|The product fits relatively well, but the color clashes, I have an Infiniti FX35 with a Wheat Interior, the pics look like a good match, but it really isn't, the mats are more light brown or off tone, it's not beige which I was expecting, but it wasn't worth shipping back for the price....
B000E2AQXA|5|Excellent filter, excellent delivery.
B00UEC87QS|5|Looks great, already had friend say he was going to get rid of his expensive ones and get these instead
B000RXKR6M|5|nI ordered this wash mitt for my boyfriend to wash his new black BMW 330i. This car is his absolute baby, so he doesn't take lightly which products he uses on it. While using it today, he said that it was &#34;the softest wash mitt he had ever used,&#34; and it made his old one feel like garbage. (In it's defense, it was pretty old and worn.)<br /><br />To use it, we had one rinse water bucket and one soap bucket, as you should to properly wash a car. He washed the car with the soapy water one area at a time, then washed the mitt out in the plain rinse water bucket so as not to contaminate the clean soapy water with dirt. After getting the dirty gunk off the mitt, he took it back to the soapy bucket to pick up more suds. The mitt held suds VERY well. It did a fantastic job, in collaboration with his new car soap, to pick up all the gravel-road dust and grit off of the car without scratching the paint.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this mitt to anyone that cares about their car and plans on thoroughly cleaning it.
B00TE42PME|5|I used this to replace the burned out motor on my Craftsman Bolton drill. It worked perfectly.<br /><br />This motor comes with wires that are soldered to the tabs, so if you are connecting this to a drill such as the Bolton, which has clips that are meant to attach to these tabs, you will need a desoldering iron to remove the wires.
B00HESVTPQ|4|worked well installation relatively easy
B0066SMFEO|4|This might not be original quality, but it does the job.<br />There were molding marks and a bit of flashing on it. And it felt a lot lighter than the original part. But if fit well, and doesn't leak at all after several months. So I would say that it's not just good, it's good enough.
B00W8HT70C|3|It doesn't fit like it should
B000NCMS7I|1|Does not work with Battery Tender. Too costly in time and money to return so I'm just out my money.
B000FCH0BK|5|perfect fit item to my 2006 Lexus IS, it does work better than anything I had before, keeps the temp a lot lower, I always crack open the sunroof to help lower the internal temp also.
B006VN38M2|5|Works very well and easy to use.
B011NSN3MY|5|great
B00IL04VNI|5|Put these on my 14 Jetta and am very happy with them. They fit perfectly and I had them installed in minutes. Feel and look nice and durable and you can't even tell they are not factory. These are a must if you want to protect your paint from chips from rocks.. Or if you just want to keep your car cleaner a little longer. They look quite stylish too.
B00Y4G7WIE|5|My son loves his helmet, gloves, and glasses. The quality of the helmet is fantastic and the packaging was superb! I was very pleased.
B007PBACH8|5|After retiring my trusty old BMW Gore-Tex boots, I was looking for an affordable alternative. The TCX X-Five's fit the bill. Very well made and fit great. They are still breaking in, so I can't comment on how they will do over time, but so far so good.
B00F676FH4|5|perfect
B0093LYB20|5|works as described.
B000KKPFFA|5|I used this to patch some dings in my kayak not cracks but holes and the stuff works great.
B00HQETDWO|5|It's more like the one I have at home. Easy to install l would highly recommend this toilet.
B000BYGFXG|5|For the price, and changing the plugs already. Its one less thing to do again, or worry about.
B00LU4L7V6|5|Love these little alien guys... for my antenna... helps me find my car!  :)  Kinda fun too.
B00VKM3PSQ|1|Starting ripping after a short time.
B00BKPR61A|1|Installed this two weeks ago, the plastic collar already broke.  Buying a rule instead
B005G5SD7Q|1|Even though I love the look of these grips. My motorcycle place refused to install them. They said that they use to install them and they ended up paying for injuries and repairs to customers after they would come apart during a ride and make the bike flip and/or crash.
B000CCFGMS|4|Ordered for a 2006 GMC Sierra 1500 4X4. I made the mistake of not measuring the clearance of the passenger side exhaust pipe crossover and had to cut roughly a foot of pipe to allow me to install it (my manifold flange bolts are rusted so I couldn't just drop it). I was planning to get my exhaust redone but now I'm doing it sooner then I planned. Just make sure you have the clearance before you purchase as it can add some pain to the job.
B0058DIDTY|5|worked like a charm
B009XIY22C|4|Easy to install, useful lock.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Works great!  Bought this twice as my poor car got spray painted twice in less than a year.  The 1st time it was silver metallic paint which was very hard to remove, but this product did it. I was devastated when I went out to go to work and found the whole side and windows of my car spray painted.  Googled how to remove and this was recommended by someone who is a professional car detailer. 3 weeks ago I got hit again w/ orange spray paint which was much easier to remove. GRRR too bad delinquents have access to spray paint!!!
B000AL8VD2|5|Great tune-up grease
B004ZO3VN0|5|I'm a believer ! Getting all the power and performance out of my motorcycle and better gas mileage !
B008B03PE4|5|Love love love! Super cute and promptly delivered. Thank you!
B00HY073LS|5|Fast shipping very bright
B0096QYZ8M|5|Was the right part and better than the original  factory part had to pay a muffler shop 150.00 to weld it in
B001TH4NZG|4|Leather is not as thin as I had feared. Stitching is good and the vertical zippers are a nice, heavy, metal construction. They come with leather cords to tie to the saddlebag support you must use. I shopped for days looking at everything in this price range. I'm happy with my purchase, so why only four stars? The other reviewer was correct, there is no hidden pocket. That is unless of course it is so well hidden neither of us can find it. Over all these seem to be a nice fit on a 2004 Harley Fatboy.
B002M3P828|1|I purchased this item because I was moving across the United States, (1,500 miles).  Within 25-30 miles at no faster than 40 mph the entire side had blown out spilling my belonging all over the highway and soaking wet with the storms.  I had extremely high hopes this would be the perfect item for my Subaru and was extremely disappointed.  With 4 ratcheting straps I threw everything back into the bag and hoped the rest of the ride was better....don't buy this item it breaks too quickly!
B00VKS1PQE|5|It fit just like an OEM part would . It was perfect and delivered on the day they said it would be.
B000A6Z9LO|5|Perfect fit and fast delivery.
B000BSY9J4|4|It worked.  When I was a young man I heard about induction coming.  Then 40 years later I finally got one.
B00I1FTXI6|5|good
B00DQJ8G6C|2|ANTENNA COLOR FADES TO GOLD/BROWN COLOR AFTER 3 MONTHS!<br /><br />I really liked this antenna at first - great look and almost no loss of reception. Neighbor and I both bought them about 2 weeks apart.<br />Fast forward a few months and the black has completely faded to a gold/brown color - looks terrible. Contacted the manufacturer and received no reply. If you do buy, plan on repainting it yourself!
B000JKBVL8|5|Works like it should. Nice to know parts are still made for 50 yr. old vehicles
B00KWLMXCK|5|Very good, durable, non fading
B00F0M6RKA|5|Works great on my 2013 F-150 Crew Cab eco<br />easy install, great price
B002XUXUTS|1|I thought this would be a pretty easy install but after 3 hours of trying to splice wires with the &#34;vampire clips&#34;, I've decided the return it. The wires from the sensors aren't a heavy enough gauge to be used with the clips and the clips could never strip and splice my truck's wires. I finally decided to just manually strip and splice the wires, but when I tested the sensors I never heard a beep. So now after I've spent hours trying to install this low quality sensor and stripping wires, I've decided to get a better backup cam system. And I really think Hopkins owes me fresh wires to my reverse lights. Now they're all patched together with electrical tape.
B00563S1HA|5|Works great!  Just I what I needed when I lost my extra set of keys.
B00AY1CEY0|5|GREAT
B008564ZQG|2|Tank is decent enough, but the clip and sensor both arrived broken. I did not have time to wait for a replacement, so I ended up using the clip and sensor that were removed from the car. Would not buy this again.
B007HG7M38|5|perfect
B004I0YD1A|5|Fit my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Perfectly. The connection for the lights was much more simple and easier to connect than the factory taillight. This product was half the price of what they wanted to charge at AutoZone or any other auto part store i searched. Great purchase!!!
B00WPW6BAE|5|Great product, works well with dash command on iPhone.
B00XQVA6GI|4|love this my grocerys do n ot rol all over the car
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Works great!
B00KRPUOR2|5|are you a man or a woman? If you're a man, you shouldn't need instructions. If you're a woman, GET OUT OF THAT TRUCK AAND MAKE ME A SAMMICH!!!!!  &#34;No instructions&#34; she says... It's an armrest cover! You want me to write a book on it?!? Get back to the kitchen LI HE! And don't you ever, EVER, think about purchasing a truck again.
B00QK12DVC|5|Fits like a glove. Looks great, feels great. Thanks
B00MYA6AXA|5|Perfect fit no problems at all,would recommend these anytime.
B00GJSWIPW|5|Awesome star wars vinyls very cute
B0049Z8X4C|5|love it good pricew
B008ESJEY8|5|I swear this is an OEM part!! Fit and finish is exactly like my factory part it replaced.
B004GF3OV2|2|Part came fast and fit perfectly .. Only problem the bolt size is different and there was not any nuts for installation in the box and I couldn't use the original ones from the car because different size so I had to drive all the way to the hardware store and buy nuts that would fit the bolts ...
B009IAIX7A|5|The product is definitely what it is claimed to be.
B00H5F3OU6|5|Fit well will buy again
B0081SDEG0|5|Absolutely perfect match and returned my A/C to like new. Took a bit of work to install, but that is mostly because it was my first A/C repair and I had to learn as I went. Overall, not a very tough task. The real tricky part was maneuvering the compressor around without fully removing it - I didn't want to have to remove/replace the coolant. Once the replacement clutch was in place, the rest of the job was just getting the compressor and alternator back in place and bolted on. The other tasks were a cake walk compared to those two.<br /><br />This kit had everything I needed, including the shims that I didn't even know I'd need. I believe i needed two of the four included.
B000GBD2X0|5|Snapped right in!
B001FANQAA|3|They do the job but they have an edge that can snag and tear your shoes (or a toe if wearing open-toe shoes or barefoot) when getting out if you brush your foot on them.<br />Manufacturer should either round off the sharp edges or plane them down to better fit the body of the vehicle.<br />They look okay, though.  Nothing fancy and okay for the price.
B006X8BATI|5|This fit perfectly and filled the unsightly hole in the center of the bumper. Great protection for the intercooler as well. As others have said, the hardware is sketchy at best. Get some stainless bolts and nylon locknuts for extra security. Heavy duty zip ties also do the trick nicely. Fits my 2012 F150 superheroes with ecoboost.
B00335F7RU|3|fits not perfect
B001UCEKSU|5|Exceeding our expectation! Good quality parts with no issues. Very pleased.
B00STNDYIA|5|It surpassed what I was expecting. Very durable and breaths great.  Heavy stitching and will last a long time.
B00T3TQLKW|5|Couldn't get enough airflow over the condenser on 18 wheeler to keep the cab cool when not running down the highway. Strapped two of these to the condenser in push mode and our problems are solved.
B000BQYA7W|5|Works great!  You must spray and leave on for a few seconds....
B004O80QP8|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B001EOWRUW|4|It has worked well with what we have done so far.<br /> I will know more as we use it more, how it will hold up but it seems to work well.
B004AGC0LC|5|Great!
B008F8Q8K0|5|Exact replacement and very simple to swap out good looking parts  I'm very happy with them
B00M29BICQ|5|very fast delivery and working well, fair price
B00292H7AI|5|Great value ,other companies were much  higher  got just what I order easy for me  to install  . Thank you
B0073MEIC4|5|It is just what I orded worked just fine thank u
B000182ES2|5|Item arrived on time...fit perfectly!!! Took a grand total of 5 minutes to install.
B003P64XU4|5|Bought 2,both look and work as stated.
B0002SR8AK|5|Works very well, well worth the investment!
B003UM7B98|5|Was looking for a new jack for my hot rod shop. The 20 plus years old craftsman finally gave out.Didn't want a China made jack.  Read all the great reviews on this one and I made the right choice buying it. Quality piece!
B00WFJ633W|5|perfect match
B00AZ4S904|3|It works but not a perfect fit.  I have to glue the edge as well for the deflector to stay in tact and prevent damage from the wind.<br />This review is specifically for dodge neon 2005 SXT.  Like I stated, other than that it works.  price was not reasonable for the quality and fitting.  Will see how it goes a year from now
B008HZJWKO|4|They work fine but they squeak when they are cold. Usually goes away after slightly braking once or twice. Good product for the price.
B00BCATXKK|3|The bolts that came with it definitely are not long enough but overall for the price I'm satisfied
B0070NNUQG|4|Look great and very easy to install. Delivered promptly.
B00Z7KIZPA|3|I have only used the product of few times.  I like the fact that I don't need to worry about my purse ending up on the floor and items falling out.  Getting the purse in and out is a little difficult right now, (can't just drop/grab and go) I'm hoping with time the opening will stretch out and make it easier.
B000C2MARW|5|It works.
B0068JTEUY|5|Love these butt containers. No chance of cigarettes falling down on car floor. Great for any smoker!
B00KNMKRU8|5|Great charger and priced perfect!
B00WT68KB4|2|Product delivered was defective. It is basically second rate junk from China. I opted for a refund instead of a replacement. I was responsible for return shipping (plus the cost) and had to send several emails to get reimbursed for it. This just reinforces the old saying &#34;if it's too good to be true it probably is&#34;.
B002L6L8XY|1|Installed about a yr ago. We live in a rural area, so not a lot of stop-and-go braking and I installed Autozone pads at the same time. These already have a very defined wear groove and warp pretty quickly when using the brakes moderately. I find it hard to believe that the pads from Autozone are that great to wear out these rotors. Seems they are soft metal and certainly not &#34;Professional Grade&#34;. I expected better than factory performance and these don't provide that.
B00E24ZR3K|5|Excellent part, a must for any MS6 owner. Drive-ability is greatly improved with this mount, and shifts feel much smoother.
B000E4SQIA|5|Part came in on time and is working good
B0035XU9ZA|4|Fits perfect.  Helps the heat, but not drastically.  Don't fold up small.  It has to ride shotgun when the german shepherd is behind the seat in the extended cab.
B009BGP4NM|5|Perfect fit great price
B00TT3GGRU|5|Easy to use
B00412YT8W|5|Good part, no problems so far.
B005MPSQFY|5|I love how beefy this club looks and my car has yet to be stolen again. So far so good. Easy to install.
B00RVECNMQ|2|After being on my car for about a week , the corners became not sticky and starting to fall off
B00L78OFI2|5|Very happy.  Excellent product for the price.
B00M9MWFFK|5|Nice fit
B00MPDA3YS|1|Piece ofpoor quality material. Thats all. Nothing functioned.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Good one
B002PQQ86M|3|yes they were great they came on time everything was really nice when it came in it was packed right I love this item make my truck looks brand new
B004GCFAM6|5|Exactly what was needed to replace a broken sideview mirror.
B0013FSWQU|5|as expected on time and factory fit
B001247092|4|Good quality but it's totally a scanned version of the original
B000C5DUN2|5|great fit
B001TNFF0W|4|easy install. I put inch spacer and did not remove tires. Was easy job. But what took the longest was finding A 15MM WRENCH..ha! OLD SCHOOL WITH USA TOOLS. lol!!
B000FW4LIK|5|did not think that it would fit but it did.  Might be ordering a replacement soon.
B0061FY004|5|Perfect for when you need to make a straight, level hole.
B00857CM8S|5|Bigfoot Research Team Decal Sasquatch Yettie...  This is a fun and whimsical decal for the Bigfoot hunter in your life.  I bought this for my uncle who is a BIG believer in the Bigfoot and I'm pretty sure that he will like it.  And seriously for the price...
B0048ENEE8|1|The rear third row mat does not fit in a 2009 Buick Enclave. When we received the first set, the mat did not fit so they sent a replacement which was exactly as the first and did not fit.
B00I3N86HK|5|Haven't tried this out on a car window but I have it ready for an emergency and at a great price.
B0031726YM|5|works good
B00XV4G0GU|5|great e z to install
B0018CWG5G|1|To start off hookup was straight forward & simple. Calibration using my GPS took about 2 miles, stopping to adjust that little screw. After that it went downhill, when accelerating my speedometer would hesitate then jump 5-15 mph in a second. While using my cruise control my truck would constantly accelerate & decelerate every 2 seconds and never hold a steady speed to save on fuel. I'm just going to buy a programmer to reset my computer for my taller tires. Using the stock with modifications program, which will be as accurate as stock settings,like I did on a previous truck. I purchased this thing hoping to save a couple hundred dollars,but at least I did get a refund from Amazon.
B000CSD6RE|4|Just what i needed for a tune up on my honda rancher 350
B005ZWN5FU|5|Great product.  Very satisfied with the process.
B004L7I70I|4|Its great, and its a perfect fit<br /><br />It slides around a little too easy, one quick brake tap and all your stuff slides with the matt.<br />Put one side of Velcro tape on the bottom so the matt can stick to the carpet.
B003ECULUU|4|Works very well in my Chevy Sonic.
B001GS0DAC|3|rear very hard to get in place ,  eventually lost left rear  Amazon replace  year later right  one gone waiting on response from Weathertech
B007Y555JU|5|Perfect fit, simple to use. Time will tell if it's durable (cheap ones usually shed fibers and fall apart).
B00AWPHG32|5|Luv the stickers I got no complaints on anything even though some I had to return for sizing all was done professionally
B00ZBK2LNS|5|Excellent
B00BYH6C1E|5|great idea
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Expensive but it's a name brand. QUite bright. It replaced an incandescent bulb in my trunk.
B00W4G3WSK|4|this met all my needs and made it much easier to use my gas storage cans
B007576MDK|5|OEM equivalent to BMW, worked as expected.
B00PNUIKDG|5|Great purchase.  My son looked at a few YouTubes about replacing the door handle, and using this replacement and the one necessary gadget had the repair done in less than half an hour.  Saved gobs of time and money.
B007MUY6LA|5|Replacement was perfect
B00YJTQU98|5|This rebuild kit worked perfect to repair the fuel cell pump on a used toyhauler I purchased.
B00WT93L7O|5|Is working good
B000GOG3PG|4|Plug and play (once you can actually get original assembly out - your &#34;fun&#34; will vary depending on your vehicle - A little noisy/squeaky but not noticeable over the radio.
B000GVNXWU|5|My husband loves it. He bought a 2006 Porsche 911 Carerra S and it fits perfectly. We'll house it in a garage in the winter months but for now, it's parked outside our townhouse and this does the job.
B004PGLFRM|5|All parts packaging and instructions were just what I needed. Was able to call for additional help and the folks there were first class
B00BLQEN9Q|4|Good kit for someone wanting to do it themselves. Would have liked more heat shrink, but overall very happy with it. XL1200L 2009
B00QRHDIPY|4|Looks to be just what we need to &#34;top off&#34; the batteries on both our small boat and car we leave in the lot when off cruising. Will use it for the car when sailing and the boat when at anchor.
B005FG63DC|5|fits great
B00CD7EMKW|5|yes worked great and got here quick!
B000GZO6CM|5|I've wanted a mikuna for years but it was never in my budget until i found a great deal on Amazon. The Carb is everything i believed it would be. Instant response and smooth power top to bottom
B004IARFHO|5|Awesome intake kit came with very detailed instructions and all hardware. Very impressed given the low cost, significant change in noise and throttle response.
B00407TURI|5|Good for my old car to improve apperiance
B004OSSCYA|5|Big help for towing my Toyhauler.
B0031I4HOI|5|Happy.
B00NX4RIO6|5|Used these for my road bike. Everyone loves them.
B00IOU1BPQ|5|works great on my 2015 crewcab Silverado. Just be sure to follow the directions lol. big help in the acceleration paired with the airraid spacer I was able to go from 27 best mpg to 33.
B001PYDZ34|5|Perfect fit for 2000 ranger
B003UMRXSW|2|Laying under the car, trying to do one crankshaft cap, and one connecting rod cap I didn't have the patience required, to try to screw the arm down, and try to use it properly. I ended up just giving the angles my best guess. For the head I used a protractor I bought at Walmart for a $1.97 plus tax. The protractor even has a swivel arm to mark the angle. I believe I was able to approximate the angles pretty closely. So far the head gasket hasn't leaked. I ended up sending the angle gauge back to Amazon.
B00PB4GLQC|5|Was a quick delivery very pleased
B000LE6AXG|4|Great gift
B009DJQKOY|5|perfect fit
B0012RI5FW|1|Wish I had read the comments before I ordered this.  DOES NOT FIT Hybrids.  I clicked on the CHECK FIT option prior to ordering and it told me that it was compatible with my 2006 Hybrid, IT ISN’T.  The quick connect is like an 100th of an inch smaller than the SUVs connector.  I mean it is just small enough that it does not match the plug.  I had considered the idea of shaving the plug down to allow it to work but thought better not; this is going back to Amazon
B001C6NL52|4|Good quality piece but doesn't have grip on the bottom so you have to line your tool box with foam or something similar.
B00BCRMA9Y|3|Good
B000AM8BF4|3|Cover was bent and one screw gone, still loose fit, will it contact electronics<br /><br />Inside who knows. where is quality control and workmanship, little scary for a product that could blow a 12volt up in your face. but who cares right, will not<br />buy from Schumacher again. tag said in oz
B00APOFQYQ|5|Shipment was fast and product was good.  Very helpful item.
B004P22CJ6|5|They arrived on time, they were easy to install, and they fit and work perfectly.  All at about half the cost of what my local Jeep dealership wanted - WITHOUT the clever center cross-bow and replacement for the rear window bar!  I am totally and completely satisfied and would highly recommend these to anyone looking for new surrounds.
B000C2PI7G|5|exactly what I needed -- fast shipping
B00KD134PY|1|Like the look and comfort but the locking mechanism fell off so had to modify it and make it permanent
B00KTHY2DA|5|Excellent case for rav4 2003
B00E8HGCEY|5|Just what I hoped for.  Wish I would have gotten the cruiser model though.
B00KMDSNAE|5|Worked great on my 1993 toyota
B00JDASJMY|5|Direct replacement for stop light bulbs in my RV.
B007YDBJD8|5|great product
B00XS0IORA|5|Love it!
B00NQCTSLQ|4|outstanding ! took only a couple of minuets
B00OJXJU8M|5|he is everything
B0051WVPB0|5|What a great value! I popped this top on in about 45 minutes. (Assembly note: the tag marked front actually goes towards the back)  I was thinking it would be an okay top to get me through a year or so until I could afford a nicer one. Forget about it! This top is of sturdy construction and the material is very durable especially for the light weight. I have run at speed with it up and it doesn't seem to bother it at all. The rear support poles are included with this top as well. With most tops you have to buy them separately at a cost of about $80.<br /><br />I guess gray is the only color, but if you're not too worried about that, this top is great!<br /><br />Multiple people at the marina have asked me about this top and I recommend it highly. Happy boating!!!!
B004XOQ0GM|5|works great,, either use teflon tape or another sealer on the ports not in use,, fram ph16 works well with it
B000XBNYYK|5|Worksgood
B005EKY1EM|5|excellent product - everything i expected.
B000ACM0T2|4|They go on very easy. Only noticed a slight improvement in trailer movement, though.
B00718W5GQ|5|works great.
B001JT5LJG|4|good stuff, made taping curved lines far easier than the wider tape.
B005OD8KAU|5|Great OEM product
B00DL6T2YK|5|This is a really nice air gauge.  I recommend it!
B00BNFVQ6I|5|This is perfect for my project car. Quality is great and it looks awesome.  I recommend it for sure.
B000E2CVIS|4|Great idea for installing and removing.  This + Socket wrench + Extension and your life becomes a lot easier every few thousand miles.
B009DJY4J2|4|For the price is ok
B00BSZ7JPU|3|This is NOT the H-D 100th Anniversary color!  It's Gunmetal Gray, which is still a very cool color!  I'll find something to paint with it.  If I wanted Gunmetal Gray it would get 5 stars.
B00J5GW7P6|1|This stuff is a mess! I followed all the instructions to the tee and when I got to the end where your put the lacquer on, the stuff is black. My rims are gray. I put it on anyway cause I thought it was going to change colors, but it did not so now I have this black paint on my grey rims and i'm going to have to have someone re-do them.
B000IG3JJA|3|You get what you pay for.
B00EC0YX70|5|Perfect
B00GU5JVKO|5|Goodnight
B00802GIW4|5|Best headlights bar none...super bright..makes night driving a breeze...my 2nd car that I have put them on.
B004APTGV0|4|It fits pretty descent could use a small altering but I was satisfied
B00YC28OUU|5|Big help for people getting in and out, I hit my head on it alot though, I don't use it
B002809JAM|5|fits good
B007TJWF30|5|Thanks , it took two orders .  Correct product tho .

B00L2NUTGO|5|Perfect fit... used video &#34;how to video&#34; on youtube installation
B0009XT7NY|5|Perfect
B0024NT250|4|Looks great with the new headlights!
B000COWANY|5|As expected
B008E951R6|1|the s*** sucks!. it said it was gonna fit my car and they lied it doesn't. Not happy
B006N95TWQ|4|they've only been in 2 weeks, but so far so good.
B0016HYEL2|5|To be clear this kit is not a direct replacement for the 004 Pontiac Bonneville SLE however it has the part you need, the wiper blades for the resistance contact.  At $43 this is the less expensive fix there is for the fuel gauge not showing the correct fuel level.  Picture #1 has the retaining clips for this item.  The fuel pump does not have the bracket that will accept these clips.  Picture #2 shoes the broken metal tips on the sensor rotor, one set is longer than the other.<br /><br />What you need to do is pop the sensor rotor off the purchased part, them pop the bad sensor rotor off the part that is defective.  To pop them out use a small socket as a punch and gently tap the pin/rivet out of the rotor.  The old pin/rivet will work with this rotor.  Assemble the new wiper on to the old retaining clip and you are ready to reinstall the fuel pump back into the fuel tank.<br /><br />In case you are wondering the original equipment fuel pump should last 250 to 300 thousand miles.  This beats $200 for the fuel pump assembly if you do it yourself of over $600 to have a shop do the work.
B00B1UYSA6|5|Awesone seller! Highly recommended!!!
B000BZJT7O|4|Works great. No wiring diagram.
B00OFU33PU|4|This is very functional. It provides a lot of storage for grocery bags (or whatever you decide to use them for). I have used all of the sections at the same time with cold/frozen items in the insulated sections. My only issue with these is the zipper used to seal each of the end cooler sections. They work very good but the zipper is manufactured with fine teeth and a small pull-tab. It functions just fine but requires a more precise alignment of the zipper sides to actually connect together. I would definitely purchase this again and would recommend it for anyone.
B00LL6PK2K|5|I love this little nifty device. Works exactly how it's explained. Definitely recommended
B007GS7HK0|5|On time and as described
B00KL27PQO|5|Fits perfectly... love it. Ordered one for my daughters car.
B00G65PJF4|5|Outstanding product for my 2015 Orange Civic Si  key !
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Added these on my atv in addition to the 20&#34; light bar I installed. Angled them about 10 degrees to the side and love it! They help give a wider view of the trails and surroundings.
B009FU7RZM|5|Replaced all for with bilsteins and its like driving a new truck without the payments
B000A0EJ66|5|it works fine
B00G5UXQ8W|5|Good fit...
B000BWDXFG|3|A decent distributor. A good application for an Oldsmobile HEI conversion from points. The vacuum advance failed after only 2 years and a replacement was $30, so that's why I only gave it 3 stars.
B00UZRC3O4|5|were tricky to install the lower section but love the look and they work well
B002UC4WAU|5|applied this several times after using the Bio-Kleen Multipurpose RV and Marine cleaner, letting soak in between coats. the boat is 12 years old, seats were in bad shape with stains and feeling dry. they aren't like new, but they are in much better shape then they were. highly recommended. betting if this had been used all along, they would still be like new.
B006X8BZJ8|5|No surprises, had this grille custom cut for a Datsun 280z. Very happy with the result.
B007AOQW24|3|Good
B0083TYGW8|4|They look really nice, I like the fabric a lot, delivered on time and in good condition. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the stitching looks a little thin, like it may tear.
B0002M7DHE|5|Excellent quality and appearance
B00TEG3GXE|5|Very detailed, Incredible. Easy to apply. These stickers are the real thing.<br />I'm going to buy some more. Thank you!!!
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Excellent!! Love that it attaches directly to the rear seat or cowl, looks a lot nicer than having retention straps placed on rear foot pegs and such. enough space to keep change of clothes and shower necessities when going to the gym, and thats without the extended storage zipper.
B0072W2V9W|5|was exactly what i needed.came on time.
B002L1F08I|1|Don't buy it. You're limited to the number of times the device works then you get screwed by SCT for $65 to unlock it for continued use!!!
B005UGG7U6|5|As described.  Fit perfectly.  High quality.
B00V5LKGJI|5|nice
B006YCMRD6|5|This is the same motor that came from the factory.  It fit perfect on the 1997 Honda Accord it went on.  This fan fits the left hand side fan as seen from the drivers seat.
B00IO0CN7Q|5|Excellent stabilizer!
B005DCKRP8|5|love it and it was delivered quick! thank you!
B00IQZB40G|5|Good quality just a lil off on fitment for lights but happy with how they look on my bike
B001VYO9JC|5|Great quality
B004MDEV38|5|Perfect fit.  Quick install, and looks nice.  Everything I was hoping for and way less expensive than the dealer option.
B00CWGEB28|4|Give my truck a very nice look,  I'm happy with it. Got delivered early.
B001UP0ENM|5|Very nice and very happy with the part. Thank you for getting it to me as fast as you did.
B005WTPC2A|5|Finally a VW alternate better than OEM and not at a dealer!
B00MA7744G|3|works good - not as bright as I expected & the power cord  was miss represented &#34;Wire length: 2ft coiled, stretched Roughly 9 Feet&#34;  - could barely stretch it to 6'https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA7744G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
B00INVEUP4|4|Works fine.
9744493380|5|EXCELENTE
B001O1O9YW|5|They are the perfect fit.
B000HBNUTA|5|hold tight and dry fast.
B00FN4PFQM|5|Works great.  Plenty loud. Easy enough to install if you can wire to your fuse panel and horn switch.  I would recommend this item.
B000EDST1K|5|Stays put going down the road, gives you much needed counter space.  They are expensive but work good and seam like they will last for a long time.
B001HLIMD8|1|Ordered two and they look completely different, one is thicker and yellowish the other not as plush and white.
B000CSEWLI|5|A+
B003E20RKE|5|Installed on my 08 c300 .....works awesome
B000VSFIWQ|5|New addition to my tester, to keep up with the newer radiator designs.<br />I got mine specifically for a 97 Ford truck.<br />Very nice; well made. Shipping was fast.
B008DX6VHC|5|Key chain is great good build
B001NZ6WXU|1|This product does not fit my 2007 ford explorer eddie  bauer , the connectors are different.  My original part number ends in an AB and this part ends in an AA.  Now cost me 6 bucks to send it back and I went to the ford dealer to get the correct part.  I was assured by the website that it would fit my truck
B0011O0YDW|5|Nice addition to my workbench!
B0056OFWVM|5|You need two of them to hold down anything sizeable, but totally love the retractable nature of the thing.  Best tie-downs I have ever owned.
B005992U4G|5|Just what I expected, works great and is very light.
B00H7LPKKU|5|handy piece really works
B005FTW69E|5|excellent fit
B00VQBXBXK|5|perfect for what I need.
B000C71BV8|1|This is the second one I returned because the piston does not have the emergency break feature pressed into the piston.  These caliper pistons are for the rear calipers that have an emergency brake feature. This feature is a device that is pressed into the bottom of the caliber piston.  The picture used to illustrate this piston shows the Emergency brake aspect installed into the bottom and It looks like a nut but is actually a device that rotates when the emergency brake is actuated to allow brake fluid to push on the piston to set the emergency brake.  Without the Emergency brake feature, this piston is worthless.
B0079GQA0C|5|SAVES ALOT OF TIME !
B001PNPMHC|1|Did not fit my '11 335i E93, despite other reviews saying they fit perfectly. I might have been able to get them to fit if I had really worked at it for a long time but it wasn't worth the effort. Plus, the quality wasn't what I was hoping for, esp. since I paid more for these than other ones available. Disappointing
B001EA0LI6|5|looks great, good value
B004DRWP54|5|Looks great!
B00UBCQ6GY|5|Easy install on my 2010 Nissan Maxima. Did not have to take the front wheels off to access. Great look. Should have done a longtime ago.
B00PCZFEAE|5|Love it!! Soo Cool!!!  :)
B000221M94|2|On Amazon, these looked great, so I ordered them. I got a new white car and could forsee a problem if the black rubber rubbed against the car. When I saw that there was a definite problem, I looked at our garage door. There are screws and a bar exactly on my garage door where the holes are in the black rubber, when I went to install the other set on the other door. I do thank the other reviewer for the foam floatation device idea, which I will do.<br /><br />As for the rubbing against the white car, I didn't even try that one. I needed to return these, and Amazon made it easy, thank goodness.
B004A6LASQ|4|Slightly more Heavy than OEM. but better quality.  this Item went into a CBA GT-R
B00006JBL4|2|This does not hold any 2 adult bikes--maybe certain ones depending on the frame, but for your average adult bikes they will bump into each other and can't really both be on at once without at least scraping. I returned mine.
B003IS3HV0|5|Works  really well.
B00LZKHKA2|5|Great batteries, these have worked perfectly since I purchased them.
B000CJ0626|5|I received the part and it was installed into my transmission pan one for drain and one for temp sensor.
B000GVEMZM|4|Awesome product. Seller was a bit slow to ship though.
B0058WXNOK|1|Very poor quality, difficult to use does not dry easy and the texture has no relation to leather when it is cured
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. Just as advertised and easy to fold back into storage pouch.
B003VDX5D2|5|I love it!
B001P4FPPK|4|Quality seat. Very good looking but after over 1,000 miles still VERY firm.
B00LX2D94I|4|good so far they pretty much do what they said,  but you have to buy a kit for the instalation
B003O387TQ|4|I have nothing to say. It looks like the picture, and it stuck to my car just fine.
B005YP3CWO|5|Very pleased with the product
B00JRE1TAA|5|Super easy to install and looks great. Didn't come with instructions but its not rocket science. Love it!
B001KZJ85M|3|The pump worked. Car started right up after I installed it. Of course time will be the real test. We shall see...
B00EQ9JMTQ|5|Best hand guards purchased for kids sx 65 ,look asome heavyduty great price and delivery
B00CCYW9HO|5|Good.
B00Q4O1HQC|4|I ordered a size 6. I am 117 lbs and 5'6&#34; and normally a size 4 - My hips are 36 inches and the sizing states that a size 4 will fit up to 36 inch hips, NOT TRUE. I could barely get the size 6 on. I am going to try an 8, but do note, these run small and while I think they should fit snug, being comfortable (like being able to sit down on my motorcycle) is preferred :) I'm giving them a 4 cause I am hopeful the 8 will fit well.
B00FJVAHG2|5|good
B0018N0XAU|4|Works great! I wish the parts were metal not plastic but no issues with that yet.
B00E7871NA|5|it's a choke. it did it's thing.
B00OV7HKA6|5|Great product! We are going to buy another one!
B00IXDN0Y4|5|Great lights for the price. Sturdy housing, installation is pretty simple. Choosing the flood light option it covers everything close to mid range.
B009MATAEG|5|This sunshade fits perfectly in 2015 Lexus GS 350.  Very high quality.
B00EO0RN5M|5|it's pretty and it works.
B00L7E80IW|4|Tissue size matches the case but after pulling out the first tissue, subsequent tissues will pop out so it will dangle in front of you so I just tuck it back in.  The original tissues packet that came with the case did not do this.  A minor inconvenience for me.  I have 4 in my SUV, 2 in the front and 2 clipped to the back seat pockets.  Will buy more refills as needed.
B0023VBHOW|4|Prompt delivery.  It arrived within couple of days of order.  Initially, tail light did not fit properly and had to fiddle around it.  After about 15 minutes, it snapped on and working properly.
B00XINZ8TO|5|Mirrors worked well on my KIA Sorento to eliminate the blind spots. Great fit on an SUV size mirror, without impairing the remainder of the mirror for regular viewing. Good construction.
B00LIS2ZJW|5|Excelent! It fit on my 2013 honda civic ex take note it only 1 pc.
B00KWMP6ZA|5|Happy, Happy Thanks A+++++++
B000GU3MRM|5|The fit my bike perfectly!
B00S9YI84Y|5|Easily replaced the factory high mount brake light on my 2001 Yukon.  It is useful to have the new gasket because the original becomes cracked and brittle over time.  I did not have to replace the factory wire with the included piece, so it was not necessary to remove the interior trim and drop the headliner to get to the connection.  I only needed a Phillips head screwdriver to make the swap.  If you have a lift gate it may help to slightly lower it when you are removing and replacing the lamp assembly as it is a tight fit.  I used a silicone lubricant on the rubber to help preserve it and improve the seal. This item allowed me to pass state inspection with no problems.
B00RM6X9I0|5|Great knee pad. The size are spot on. It's comfortable and well made.
B010F66C96|5|I got one of these for one of my cars and then ordered another one for the other car. Not sure why that other guy says its to small... It's your standard 3 by 7 bumper sticker and it clearly says that in the title. GO BERNIE SANDERS!!!!
B000N9NARS|4|Looks nice and does as they should.
B00429NKWK|5|This took a lot of elbow grease but was worth it.  Headlights are clear and you can easily read the small print at the bottom of the lens.  My only worry is how long it will last.
B000EDQR5U|5|I've used these for a couple of months, including a 1600 mile trip.  They have held up well.  They are easy to install and easy to use.  Mine hold an aluminum step stool, and two folding aluminum tables with room to spare.  Update:  Oct 2016.  Still working well and holding the chairs and step stool over 8,000 miles of travels.  A lot of Camco stuff is junk.  This product is pretty good.
B0026JAKDK|5|Solid jack that I got because it matched my colors on my Jeep. Haven't had to use it yet but we will see if it holds up...
B002YCEIRS|5|We had to replace the factory regulator for my husbands 98 camry. This part worked perfectly. It doesn't look exactly like the original, but it works just the same.
B004PILLZG|4|Its not sticky enough, I had to add some more adhesive
B007H2RDHW|5|Paid 30 for some metal polish used a mothers power ball to polish it spent 2 hours doing my sled tunnel ordered sledbrite and use papertowel and its ridiculous how well this works gives it a mirror shine with zero effort.
B00K779ECG|5|Just what I was looking for for my 9 yr old splash trailer fits perfect.
B00KN0UOEE|5|The absolute best stuff to take care of your car and boat!
B00199FYKW|5|Perfect fit for my 93 Suburban!
B003EOZH9S|5|These are a great addition and provide some extra flex space for your tires. I plan on running these in the summer and OEM back on for the winter for extra coverage due to the installation being so simple! Don't expect to lean these up against a tree for protection they are not designed for it however it's exposes the tire more so you don't really need it anyways. I have received ton of positive comments and the when I tell them the price they even are more amazed.
B00R6IWASE|3|THE FABRIC IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT BUT IT´S OK
B00TUKXO5Y|4|It's pretty but too big for my Prius steering wheel. It fits my husband's Lexus though.
B003D4KA32|5|Awesome. A bit bigger than you think but as described and seems to be of pretty high quality
B00A82A4GA|5|Great battery. Need to slowly charge when you first get it. Test it, then put it in the transformer. Horse wire is back in business!
B00CTUD48O|5|All 100% ok Muchas gracias
B00FPW5WGU|5|Great quality. Super shinny
B000C59ZUY|5|Vic drives quiet and smooth once again , get theses forget the cheaper brands
B00EGSFFNY|5|Exact replacement for my application. 15 min install, and it ran like a top afterward.
B0024GJ568|5|This is a really good charger. I had one just like it but it was hit by lighting so I replaced with the same charger. Very good charger, meet my needs.
B00CFALFXY|5|Perfect replacement for my ratty old rags that were well past their prime.  They work wonders cleaning my granite counter tops and stainless appliances with just a little water.
B00X9E0HRK|5|I gave this one to my stepdad as a replacement to his power outlet on his truck. He said i was very to install and the wire was just right. He said it works and he likes it a lot. I got this under promotional value in exchange with my honest review.
B00X2KPCDK|5|I like very much is what I was expecting to get.
B000F5JLP0|4|works so far
B00T3TQLKW|1|Fans move very little air. One of my Stock 98 camaro fans flows way more than both of these fans combined
B004FFHI8I|5|Great sunshade! Easy to use and store.
B00EKTJT9U|5|I LOVE IT
B00BPFGALC|5|A good buy.  NGK plugs work best in my Echo engines.
B001HT44P0|5|We needed to replace the seat on our 1979 Honda Goldwing and it did the job great! Yes, we have a 1979 Goldwing, running. The seat was terrible and we couldn't find a replacement anywhere that said it would fit our bike.  We are so happy with this seat, it was a screw on and go.  We would definitely buy this again! The price rocked!
B00KPHM060|1|I bought an extra large and it fits a little snug inside for me.  Also, the size of the exterior makes it look extremely large on my head.  I would have returned it, but overseas shipping would have made that too expensive, so I have an expensive decoration for my shelf now.
B00WQHMMVK|4|Very handy to have things within reach, I'd like it to have a bottom strap as it sways back & forth on the seat. I add a freezer gel pack & find that to be a big help in keeping things cooler in our Texas heat. Overall a nice organizer & I'm happy with it.
B00176DDPK|5|Make sure you shake a LOT, even while you are spraying. Also, lay a thicker coating down with this compared to normal spraypaint.
B00NOKPPK8|5|It's awesome very bright. Good for off road use and even good for a work light
B008E9LWEM|5|Great product. Stuck very well to back window of vehicle. No air bubbles to worry about. Gave rainbow pride sticker to someone who was happy to get it. Got here faster than I thought it would. Thanks!
B0009JB7GI|5|Awesome!!!!!! Looks very real and pretty bright at night. Fooled some people but mainly use it for car shows. I added a white led light to spice it up. Good buy for the money and had no problems with it yet!! Thanks for the awesome master piece
B003IHKXKY|5|Works great on the trailer I put it on, good and strong, simple product.
B000CPCCFY|5|I bought 4, 2 below the tripple tree, 2 above. A little big for the xj750 forks, but looks so much better on a blacked out bike.
B005HAP2ZG|5|ok
B005LGWRZY|5|I broke my last one trying to get in my truck with a milk jug in my hand. I bought this and it looks better than the original. It's clean. Love it.
B00T3TK3EW|3|not powerful enough to do much good.
B000CHGIFM|4|Works great!
B000NKCM58|5|This kit is easy to install and the it looks great under the hood.  It has increased my fuel mileage by 2 miles per gallon and gives the engine a healthy growl.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00DBMLY8G|5|great solid tools save me lots of time, highly recommend for DIYs
B00VZMY1I4|3|When wet very heavy  but can wash my car. With less dips in the bucket. Cleans up well
B00U1KMFRU|5|perfect fit!
B00HDOU60U|5|A++++++
B00Z515O5K|5|Excellent customer service! Jumper cables exceeded my expectations
B00496LM4E|5|New filter works very well and a/c unit works better as well.<br />D
B00KY08Z8A|5|long lasting
B008DY5GDQ|5|A++++++
B000C9SOHK|5|Perfect fit for my 93 Suburban
B001FIDNGO|5|boyfriend put them on and so far they have stayed in place. No problems what so ever.
B00BSEJYCM|5|Batteries came in record time, the fit was perfect and hopefully will last as long as the original ones.
B00HR26U0S|2|Less than a month, two of them are gone
B008RAAOJW|5|Working great. No rtv needed. Just as advertised.
B00MWPC3N8|4|Impressed with the material on top and the red stitching, however like other covers I've bought, the straps are cheap and don't hold it down very good but I tucked it in pretty well. As with other covers the headrests don't fit my 2007 Dodge Charger very good either. The display picture says it all, and when I put them on there are still creases and wrinkles which I think will eventually smooth out. On the day I put these in i left the windows open and it poured on them, so I ran out and with one swipe of a paper towel they were completely dry. Very nice water repelling material. All in all I like this product, but only time will tell if they wear well. And by the way, they come one per box.
B000182EWS|1|Broke before I even put them on
B00KH8GW48|5|Excellent product for the money.
B00W9ODC0A|5|Absolutely love it excellent
