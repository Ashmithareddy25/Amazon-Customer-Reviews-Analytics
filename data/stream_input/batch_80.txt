B00O9A37IY|5|Great hat...just what I've been looking for.
B00N6ELPY2|2|Smaller in size than expected
B00NW7LJO4|5|My daughter loves it.  Very comfortable and is durable.
B00B2G187A|1|chest is a bit large, arms are a bit to short, the outer fabric seems really old, however the inner lining is fine
B00CB84OGU|4|I bought this as a nursing top, not for maternity. That being said I think it would be a little small to wear during late pregnancy. The ability to nurse with this top is nice, the configuration works better than with other nursing tops.
B000UJY3W2|5|Good
B00QRBZY48|3|Expected higher quality from Lacoste, but acceptable.
B0052BAKUC|5|Wife has been looking for some overalls that fit her, and we finally succeeded.  Got them for her for Christmas.  Good quality, look good and are comfortable.
B00IZT7OD4|5|The fabric is thin, but I love the way it hangs. No sewing to hem...just cut...straight.
B0039824PO|5|I've been using these socks since birth for my 7 lb 7 oz baby. They stay on his feet great.
B000RWH8U6|3|I love to wear toe covers in the summer to avoid getting blisters and keeping my toes dry.  These are well constructed and I love the padding on the bottom.  They are too big, though, for most shoes, in that they show above the front of the toe box.  I have older ones that are shorter on the top and I wish these were the same.
B00ACD8O0I|5|I got this shirt a few days ago, and its so cute!  I generally wear smalls, and ordered one size up, and it looks just like in the picture. I can't wait to wear it out ^ u ^!
B000SKLTI4|2|They are over the calf, at least for the first 10 min. Fabric is very thin and cheap. I'm figuring these socks will last 6 months. If you bleach your whites, possibly only 3 months.
B00CUMKI44|5|Most of the sazac kigurumis don't come with pockets. I was so happy when I got it for my boyfriend and saw that it does. I searched high and low with his last kigurumi to make sure it didn't have pockets. But that one wasn't fleece. We gambled with this one because he wanted the lemur. What a lovely surprise. Plus it's made with that sazac quality that can't be argued with.
B00D3D4IOA|2|This item came to me with a whole in one of the pockets. I ordered a medium, but it fit like a large.
B000NZVD3A|5|I needed a new beard and wig for an appearance as a school Santa - wouldn't wear the one that's been around for years there. This set was full, soft, and curly. The wig is full enough to cover the straps from the beard, and the beard has a wonderful shape. The beard and wig were packed neatly in netting for safekeeping, and to prevent tangles, and the items arrived quickly. Over 100 kids and noone pulled my beard to check if it was real. I guess they believed.
B005HQHPRI|5|Arrived very quickly and true to size/fit. Nice lightweight hoodie, seems sturdy. Will change the review if it falls apart anytime soon.
B0046IHUF0|4|Beer-tastic!
B0042QOBQW|4|at first i wasnt sure if was gonna fit me or not. but it did because its an ajustable halter that ties on the neck and the back so it will fit anyone. i just wish the that band had more detail to it. but overall it was a good buy for the price.
B005GCMTG0|2|Didn't like
B00IPFVKFG|1|Ordered an XL for my wife who wears a medium in all of her other coats and blouses.<br />This in XL is still too small for her.
B00LZOQ3KG|5|Perfect Elsa dress at a great price. I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter- the largest size is comparable with other dresses she has in size 6x.
B00V961WX8|5|Lovingly Organics makes a super soft high quality smart suit! My little boy was looking good in his and I was happy knowing he was dressed in high quality, eco-friendly material.
B0001ZO3WU|5|Most comfortable briefs ever used.
B00APK50YG|4|I bought the dress in two different colors. It is a little long otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B006HT37F8|5|It is a nice weight of denim not too heavy or thin.  If I take it directly from the dryer it is very nice.  Once I forgot and it sat several hours in the dryer  and the wrinkles were minimal.  The seller sent the new shirt still in the original packaging and within the time stated.  I'm a happy buyer.
B00S7SZ0GG|5|Gifted this cute bag to my niece who I think will grow up to be a crazy cat lady. She absolutely loved it.
B00BNQSA3O|4|Very good quality belt.  The black and brown combination means I can wear it with anything and it looks good.  The belt is a little wider than most dress belts but still fits the belt loops without a problem.
B0047N10GY|5|They look nice and fit great.  I would advise these as a good value I do not have 6 more words.  Whoever thought that up is nuts.
B008BP5WBI|5|My toddler wore this today for the first time. We got compliments after compliments. She felt like a little princess. Too cute!
B00EPPRQI0|4|This shirt is a paper thin flannel, not the weight I expected.  It did not shrink up in the dryer, so that is a good thing.  Is a pretty print and nice color.  Will only last one season though.
B00HTS8PVC|4|A size 16 cannot wear a XXL. I will have to remove a seam and put new elastic in the waistband. The pants are good quality other than that. Soft, nice material.
B008MATQCS|2|Way too tight for size large, which I wear in all my shirts. Too difficult to put on and take off, especially in the Phoenix heat. Might be better in the cooler months. I would recommend a the size larger then what you normally wear. The slim part is nice, but they need to figure a way to get it on and off.
B00FW6AYC6|5|nice shirt
B00EDTLUSA|5|I purchased this pair of jeans in a size 18.  Normally I wear a 18W from Cato's, but I had been looking for a pair of skinny jeans that would fit a big girl the right way.  I was hesitant about purchasing them because they were a Juniors plus size and my thought was, &#34;I'm 35 so I shouldn't even consider a juniors pair of jeans.&#34;  My second thought was to take the chance and at least try them on.  If they didn't fit I've never had an issue with returning the through Amazon so why not try it.  I have to say I am so glad I did. These jeans are VERY comfortable.  They stretch to fit my curves in all the right places.  There is no issue with having a muffin top. They are truly a skinny jean and even though I have a hard time wearing rider boots because of my large calves.  I could still wear the boots over top of the jeans because they are snug like a skinny jean is supposed to be.  I literally wear them all the time for almost a year.  I am so impressed with Wall-flower that I'm purchasing another pair today.  I would recommend this jean to everyone I know. If you are having reservations on whether to buy this jean I would definitely take the chance with this pair because you will be pleasantly surprised.  What's the worst that could happen they don't fit right and you do a refund or exchange through Amazon? The only thing your out is time.
B000922TIU|5|Perfect.
B003XDTBH4|5|Very comfortable, and I love them. Wore them for softball this year mostly, but come winter time they will also be great around the house. Great shipping time. Have a great day!
B00GZ0RXKE|4|It's a great cover up over a bathing suit.
B00OAU9WZ0|4|Love it! Fits great. Just long enough to cover my rear. Smooths my belly too.
B003APIRAM|1|They were terrible!  One Shamrock fell off within 5 miuntes of wearing it and the second (including the spring) fell off 5 minutes later.
B00C66HU68|5|i LOVE this suit!!!! It is padded and has an underwire so it keeps you in place! the price and shipping is fantastic, and it is so super cute! fit perfectly!
B005CSNTQW|5|it is warm, soft and very comfortable. I really like it. But it might not be useful in cold winter.
B007RZ8PEY|5|Still fits good, This shirt shrank in cold water.  That's why I bought it 2 sizes too big.  Kick ass shirt!
B00NX37XNS|5|One of the t shirts,the 3xs one,because the style or the fabric was somewhat small,it does not fit well,I need some info. regarding how to change it ,Idont think you have a larger size,or get a refund or a credit,please let me know what to do
B002QQCJLY|3|These are very pretty but they are not a 1 size fits all or even most.  I usually wear a 1 size or a small/medium and they fit perfect but these went a few inches above my knee and did not stay up very well.  I will wear them but I will not purchase again.<br />If you are very slim they may be ok but they still do not stay up very well without a garter.
B005C4Y56Y|4|These are pretty good costume gloves for the price. The material is not too cheap but I already see a hole in the stitching after wearing for 20 minutes. I'm petite and this glove fits perfectly--fingers, length, etc. Now I just have to practice my princess wave, and all will be good.
B007RX49NC|5|Really cute and well worth the price. Runs a bit small.
B00EVIXGDK|4|good pucharse
B00C43M7M0|5|Absolutely love the mask, well made, fits very well.
B003ZZEDZ0|5|Fue lo que se pidio, de buena calidad y lindas, lo unico malo fue el embalaje, resulto muy costoso cuando llego a mi destino.
B00A3ITSAM|5|Got these for hubby they are true to size so if he likes baggy go up a size  great price you cant loose!!!
B004RDQWEE|5|Made in USA.  I ordered XXL size; fits just right.  I'm 5' 10&#34;, 250 lbs.  I just ordered a second pair.
B005H27CD4|5|The item arrived in time and was exactly as pictured. Bought the item as a gift and my niece loved it.
B004G181CI|1|better off running to your local Wal-Mart for this shirt. Sizes were more like mens, and took a long time to arrive.
B00JQWEJ46|5|I wore with black sari, exactly what I needed.
B00MA794US|4|Not bad but slightly loose on me, ordered size 5.
B005NKKK8E|4|I got these for Christmas. I've worn them twice and so far they are holding up well. I didn't give 5 stars because they tend to slide down once in awhile, so I have to pull them back up.
B007WADUVC|5|My daughter loved this shirt!  It fit as expected!
B00CPJDMUE|5|Very comfortable
B00MEBAMI8|4|really liked
B00F93DOGA|5|Gave this to my husband for Christmas. He has worn it every week since!  It washes well, dries quickly and has kept its shape.  He does wear a heavy shirt under it though, but he's rather cold natured. It was a good purchase!
B002KIZOSI|5|This is a really cute poodle skirt.  Good quality for the price.  Sizing is as listed.  I am excited about this costume
B00KM597ZC|1|It fit as far as the size, however it was too short.  I'm 5'4&#34;
B00J8O15CQ|5|Fits like a glove I love these
B001BL7CF8|5|I LOVE these pants...finally a pair that's long enough!  I normally wear an XXL, and was happy that I could get into these pants (with no room to spare.)
B00CP8O11O|4|Not what expected but it's still a nice top
B0009JE7DS|4|These fit our son well (he is in the 50% and wears clothing true to size). The only thing I've noticed is that the neck opening is large and stretches out very easily.  We use the more for under bulkier clothing, so it doesn't bother me, but it does look funny when he has one on by itself.  On the plus side, they're VERY soft and made of great fabric.
B00EI3XUXE|5|I'm satisfied
B005EVQ3EW|5|It fits perfectly, comfortably.  I  appreciate the pockets--all six.  The price better<br />than I can get elsewhere on a similar jacket.  RGB
B00558PA34|1|Very bad quality. I went to the beach in a family vacations to nice 5 stars hotel and, guest what? I was laying down in a chair in the pool and place a towel under me, and after some time I get out of the chair and the towel that was under me was completely stained the color of the swimsuit . Days later when we got home swimsuit washed by hand and It got faded. I was so embarrassing!!!
B00KV30MIG|5|I purchased these because I love kissing cleavage.  They turned out great and lasted a long time.  It was an easy decision to purchase from this brand again when I finally had to replace.
B008U7U6EA|5|Excellent price reduction before Christmas. My son loved it and the sleeves are long enough for his 6-4 frame. He finds it warm enough and loves the chest high pockets.  Excellent value for me. And super look on him.
B0006LP3ZA|4|No real complaints except that Bare Essentials uses the United States Postal Service which is very unreliable in my neighborhood (believe it or not -- Northern Manhattan) so I didn't get my product. UPS ground is much better and I'll often not order from those who use the post office.
B0010ZAV80|1|The socks do not stay up after one washing. They were the most expensive socks I have ever purchased and are not worth the price.
B00IE8W5F8|1|Thought I was getting a casual pair of shorts. Received a pair of swimshorts. Not what I expected. I could have bought the same shorts at Walmart for $7.99. Very very disappointed.
B008I0JAWS|5|I have had these gloves for a couple weeks now. They are well-made and comfortable. I would highly recommend them.
B00ACIGNJW|5|Outstanding product, genuine Hanes briefs.  The fit is perfect and material is extremely durable.  Care is very easy and should provide many years of service.  Items are exactly as described.  Reasonable price, great value; highly recommend.
B00BMJHHUE|4|I love Rachel Pally's clothes & was thrilled to find this particular jumpsuit here. It was sold out everywhere else & I really wanted it. Looks great, especially on curvy women. Really cinches the waist & flatters the body!
B00HIILIO4|5|This is an edgy slant on a traditional  hoodie.<br />And warm too!<br />I'd buy them in every color!
B00T12AGF2|5|Nice item
B008H5TD8U|5|Received early, the packaging was well worth the money paid. They take extra care! GOOD quality cloth too. Fits great. would order again!
B00J0QC4KY|3|Fit on the big side! Quality is good as unfortunately they didn't shrink in the laundry.  I would buy these again,
B00HS5P442|3|The tie is really okay, the material is not too great but what you see is actually what you get -no deception. The product came on time and all four ties were okay. The tie looks really spectacular when worn on black or appropriate color match. It is slightly on the wide side though. Otherwise it is very good.
B0045H0L1W|5|Kids of all ages love these!  These have kept the kids happily occupied for many hours!  A very good price too.
B00BHLEZWA|4|I bought this shirt and didn't realize it was a adult small. I was trying to order a child small so it was way to big on my toddler  but the shirt its self was nice. Would purchase again only double check size :)
B00IFHPOR4|5|I really like this it fit nice and looks awesome.  the shirt fit me perfect and the R on the shirt isn't ironed on
B00G43EXKA|5|I love this sweater. I live in Texas ( yes it gets cold in Texas) and this sweater is very warm. The only complaint I have is if you need to take it off, it's a hassle to undue the buckles and snaps. It looks great and is very comfortable.
B00B01HKDI|4|The shirt looked exactly like it does in the picture, however when I got it and tried it on, it was way smaller than expected. I do know quite a few Whovians though. Maybe one of them will appreciate it as a gift if they don't already have one.
B000ZQAFIQ|5|Thanks to this mask, another successful B&E is in the books. I barely got away. The cops got on my trail; I stashed the goods and ditched the mask before they picked me up. The witnesses on the scene could not positively identify me.<br />The $6 I paid for this mask more than made up for itself, saving me 3 to 5 years. Since I lost the mask in the pursuit, I will be buying another.
B00ECIYWA0|2|It's not long enough I thought I ordered the one with the longer torso but it turns out that it's to short
B000N3RU1Q|5|Great pair of pants. Very comfortable. Glad that I ordered them. May order more in different colors. More than satisfied.
B00GKCAKCA|4|Fits as expected and like the color. I also like the material and that is it supposed to protect me somewhat from the  harmful sun rays.<br />Can use it in the water (pool, pond, etc.) and also for day use with some pants.<br />Good product.
B00PWRLNHA|5|The wallet is very nice and has lots of room in it.  I  am very pleased and it looks great!
B000E61LWQ|4|I bought a large but it was way to tight. I struggled so much to put it on but when I did, I was amazed at how affective it was. Im sure if I get a size bigger Id be even happier. I will purchase an XL next time. The delivery as always was fast. Very high-quality product
B00IWBFQIU|5|Highly recommend this product
B00J93XVK0|5|Dress is really cute.  I like the material, it fits well.  Great for Summer.
B002HOQVVO|5|I was very impressed with this costume. I love it! It looks just like the picture. The material is very soft and feels good, very good quality for a costume. The headband and the dress fit very well. The only downside is that the dress is pretty short. Unless you want everyone to see your underwear you'll need to wear something under it. But great costume! Especially for the cost.
B004QFUI02|5|He has an array of underwear to choose from, yet always wears these. Always. He loves them. I guess he likes the way they perfectly cradle his man-package is soft, cool comfort.
B0050275SI|2|I bought this bra based on it's 4.5 star review and the shape/silouette it gave in it's model photo. I wanted something comfortable that I could still wear out under fitted shirts without looking like an old lady.<br /> Once I got this in the mail and actually tried it on, this bra is hardly better than going with a cheap walmart sleeping bra. I bought the bra in a size smaller than what I had found at other retailers, simply to avoid the baggy, \\"torpedo\\" look that some soft cup bras gave. Even after my milk came in, this bra did little that my breasts didn't do for themselves. The cups themselves have no formation, just jersey-like knit that will keep them from moving around too much. Fine if that's what you want ,but with the beautifully photoshoped model in the pic, I think its not represented accurately at all. The under \\"nursing\\" part of the bra is not hidden by the overlapping cups, something that I always found looks tacky. Great if you want something minimally shaping and comfortable under your clothes for around the house, but disappointing if you wanted the shape and support of the photo, to wear out. Would not buy again!
B008OENKV0|1|Loved it while it worked.  While it is heavy, it gave me a very long battery life for my phone.  Unfortunately, it stopped working about a month after I started using it.
B00872DI02|5|I had questions about how the belt was made. The manufacturer called to educate me and offered to do just about anything to satisfy me. World class customer service. Really exemplary. Love my belt and recommend them highly.
B002R0FA9C|5|I was really impressed with the quality of this leotard.  It is silky smooth and super stretchy and has lasted through many washes. It doesn't pill or snag and is lined in the front. Great value!
B000JG9VGE|2|My wife thought the sweater was of poor quality and not up to the standards of the women's clothing industry.  We will not buy this brand name again.
B00EE0R8UC|4|Muy daugther so happy,perfect birthday present
B00JQLYQ68|5|Great fit, can be dressed up or down. Washes like a dream
B00CQG4GT2|5|Beautiful
B008KE51PW|3|Size ran two small
B00DV0NR9M|4|Soft.. cute shirt
B00MQB5876|5|love this shirt. fits nice. got a large and it fit like i thought it should. great quality. very happy. looks like my rescue!!
B0009IYRBQ|4|My son loves it!!
B0027VT60A|5|The costume was great,good miterial, mask ok, price was great, Halloween Express wanted $85.oo dollars for it.I paid way less money for the costume on Amazon. Big hit at the halloween party. As with any mask hot,stickey and sweaty, be better if you paint you own face, just saying, as for some of the other review's on this costume some people are never satisfied.. bitch.. bitch.. bitch.<br />Go buy the materials and make you own and see how much money and time you spend on it.
B00MWHQDOQ|5|Love carters, these were a perfect Christmas morning pj set
B00ECWFV06|5|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas! She absolutely loved it. She thinks she's a diva anyway, so when she wears this coat, she has extra pep in her step! Great price, too!
B00FQLK62U|5|these ear muffs keep my ears so warm and toasty and sit the sit perfectly on my big head.  Also, when i Leave my Hair out (afro), it gives me such a cozy look :)  great purchase!  and it they ever break, I would certainly buy again
B00K72F4UW|3|The material is good but not too stretchy, had to give it away because it was too tight.
B00J8WIR6K|5|Love these pants, they are so comfortable and look awesome on.
B00N23HCFS|5|Comfortable and fits great!
B00WB1PEHA|3|nice shirt to large
B00EZYRWQ2|5|Wife loves it!
B005UA89O4|1|The listing for this item is misleading, the images show an attached (or detachable) skirt/bustle but it was not included. I should have read the reviews more carefully.
B006UJFOI8|5|This shirt fit perfectly according to juniors sizes! I have washed and worn it several times already and it hasn't shrunk or lost coloring! If you love Doctor Who then this is a great shirt for you!
B00DUAI04A|5|for those of us who don't like the tight leg fit.
B00UI2USQ6|5|Beautiful, high quality shirt. Better than expected!
B008YN4I44|3|I ordered a large, but it was too small.  I thought it would fit loose, but it didn't.  I gave it to someone that wears an extra small.
B00JGC4YMI|3|definitely not for running and more for yoga, but comfertable
B00S4AF5K8|3|Good for the price.
B00C9HBRJK|5|Love, Love, Love these jeans. I have searched high and low for a comfortable pair of jeans for years. I finally found them in these. The After Midnight does shrink differently than my other pair the Atlantic Blue. I think the After Midnight are a little bit tighter now that they have been washed a few times. I probably won't put them in the dryer again.
B00553Y21K|4|I've always liked my Glamorise bras but felt an underwire would give me better support.  I bought this exact same bra but one cup smaller and liked it but noticed a gap between the girls.  So I ordered the DD and it is a better fit but I'm surprised at how snug it feels and still a small gap.  It does however have a good firm support.
B003R8CNV6|2|This fits very snugly. I ordered my normal size, but it is form fitting and I prefer loose. Recommend going up a size or even two if you want a looser fit.
B000VCQJES|5|Just what I wanted
B00CTRSCVG|2|doesn't look anything like it does on picture. It is much more smaller and even if it fits you, its more of a blouse than a dress, too short for a dress
B00SKA5OOE|5|Beautiful fit and flow
B002LSI2ZO|2|These ended up getting donated.  And while I was washing them and trying to get them ready for hemming they picked up an ung*dly amount of cat hair which no amount of lint rollering removed.  Very annoying fabric blend, worse than others I've had in this already-cat-i-fied household.  Would NOT recommend.
B00IB69DQ2|5|I purchased these shirts for my 2 year old grandson. He doesn't like to keep shirts on, he says the tags bother him or the shirts are too itchy. We put this on him and we didn't hear any complaints, he just ran off to play again. I will definitely be buying more! I would recommend these shirts to anyone with sensitive children/grandchildren.
B00AP7JM7A|5|It's thin, and it can hold lots of things.  I also like that there's no hard material on the outside, which damages your pants over time.  The smell wasn't as strong as I thought it would be (given a review I read on here).<br /><br />I like it, and I'm sure as heck not going back to a trifold.
B00KW61OAC|5|Fantasy c.f.
B00JO7BYAU|1|It was entirely to small I can't enjoy this piece on th beach reason for buying it
B00AL8I7E2|5|I absolutely adore this shirt! It has a softer fabric, and has been washed two or three times and has not seemed to shrink! I often wear it out in public, and this has earned me some jealousy from other Hetalians. Of course I don't mind it at all, because i would be jealous too! its a great investment and I know I will be wearing it for a long time.
B00A2IDU5M|5|very happy with the purchase! it fit as expected!! Love the colors
B00CXMZ2G0|4|After purchasing, low prices and friendly guidance was in a good mood
B008G4PIBS|2|Don't waste your money.  This is too small.  I think it is meant for little girls.  It looks like it will fall apart any minute.
B00CRXKJTK|4|The package arrived on time via Prime and are as described by the seller. These Levi's are great and the only ones that I have purchased for some years now, albeit in various different sizes as my waist changes  They fit great and wear extremely well.
B00STTXKYC|1|Way too small! I ordered a 12 and it didn't fit my daughter who normally wears a size 4.
B000JE7UDM|5|Quick shipping and great price, exactly what I was looking for!
B000GA75PW|5|Suddenly my bras felt too tight, and I kept throwing money away on new ones. Then I came across this bra extender and solved the problem while saving money!
B005C2PXGM|5|The jacket fits great and it is of very good quality. I am a 2 sometimes 4 size in petites. This works well in 4 petite for me in Anne Klein brand.
B00MTWRZB4|1|It was ok.  I don't think it was worth the money
B00M5CV9F6|5|I love it.
B002FB2XU2|3|This is decent quality beret but unfortunately Kangol seems to have lost their tape measure.<br /><br />I wear an XL and already have older Kangol hats in that size that fit quite well.  When I opened the box and put this hat on I was very surprised that it was quite tight.  I double checked the tag and info on the hat itself and yes, both indicated XL.  Since XL is the largest size they offer I apparently can no longer add to my Kangol collection.<br /><br />ShoeBuy handled the return efficiently and professionally.
B00D2PPA1E|1|I tried on one of these dresses it was like fitting into a very tight nylon glove.<br />The style is very nice.  If the material was anything other than it's present fibers, I would purchase them again.
B00ILS32XK|5|Exactly as described. Comfortable and look nice T the same time.
B0093KTQ6C|3|read other reviews. so purchased a little larger and still slightly tight
B00HRCO9TW|5|I LOVE this top! And I plan to get in all colors. I got an XL and I'm probably a 38C. I also have a little bit of a tummy and the rouching combined with the racer back really flatters my figure. I highly recommend!
B004TFIROI|5|I love the olive color so much, it's soft and warm and I am stoked.
B00AQT7ZQM|5|They were a perfect present. Great fit & look. Would buy from Elite Hero again!
B00VSZNEZY|2|I had to return it. The fit was all wrong and the sleeves were way, way, too tight. The fabric was okay. It looked more like a linen and from the picture I thought it would be a softer cotton. The color was more yellow than I like and the length is not as long as it looks in the picture. Really disappointing.
B00VRAL1S2|3|This dress arrived before the stated date. However it is really thin. You have to rear a slip, and the top of the dress does not close over my breast, like in the picture.  I had to wear it with a tank top. I was able to make it work,  and received several compliments in this dress.
B008TOSMAY|5|I was worried this wouldn't fit. It is really hard to find a good sports bra for the larger cup sizes and then to add no bounce. I was impressed! I wear a 38G-H. I think I ordered a 38G and it is awesome. One of the best parts is it takes most of the weight off my back and I don't feel pain there while exercising.  I would definitely purchase another!
B000PD7RQW|2|They look really cool but I never managed for them to stay on, maybe I needed a stronger glue? I don't know, I was really excited about wearing them for a party and got really disappointed
B00DCTLRQM|5|Perfect dress!<br />I wear it on a date and to work!<br />Love it!
B005SICIPY|5|just what i need to play on computer and talk on cell  phone when its too cold in the house, and i don't want to turn the heat up.
B00FPKO2B8|5|Ordered up a size and glad we did as it runs small.  It worked well for snorkeling and swimming.
B00CQS9PUK|5|Very happy with this purchase.  Arrived as promised, and fits as expected.  Was a bit concerned when it arrived as the package was super small.  Item had been vacuum packed, but fluffed up nicely.
B007DWLULG|5|it looks even better than the photo, its as small as i wanted it to be  but holds everything.<br />So glad i got it!
B00M49F1QI|5|Very nice and has a good look
B00GJOAZWE|3|I really like the color scheme of this sweatshirt and it fits as expected, but I don't like clunky metal logo on the chest.
B0036BD304|2|These are fit for a child's wrist. Wish I would have known that before buying them!
B00HZLQDU8|5|Fits great!
B009NDGEFA|5|These were as expected.  The fuzzy type and warm.  My 13 year old enjoys them.  Nice to wear around the house.
B00B2VAKBU|5|These are very comfortable and great looking. I'm 5'8&#34; and 130lbs and I ordered a small and they fit perfect.
B00ZXR6E46|2|I did not realize that I was ordering 'extra large' size nine.  I can wear them but they bag and are not regular size nine, so I'm not happy, but not willing to pay to send them back for a smaller size.
B00H810XOM|5|Just received my belt only 2 weeks after placing the order!  I emailed the seller with a question & received a fast response (less than a day later).  The belt looks exactly as it does in the picture, very comfortable fit & looks great with my dress!  I'm very happy with the product, the customer service & the incredibly fast shipping (2 weeks).  (Happy Face)
B00JX4BSZA|5|I was looking for a higher quality Tee too wear under scrubs and other tops.  This Tee beat all expectations! Great quality, excellent fit.  I am a small and this fit great all around particularly in the arms. It is a longer fit (but not too long) and lays nicely.  I will be buying other colors and wearing alone as a great looking and great fitting Tee.
B008UH74SG|5|Love it
B00H5XT0HY|4|My nephew loves his new pajamas
B005CSOHAY|5|fit as expected....nice!
B004HJ6V80|5|Purchased as a Christmas gift, along with the umbrella and boots, for my great niece. She absolutely loves them.
B00LH3O04G|1|I ordered the shirt pictured above and received something completely different. It also took two additional days of shipping.
B008M3JXCI|5|As a working chef I go through chef pants like crazy. Chef pants tend to get weak and start to fade fast. Within six months they are worn. About seven years ago I started buying Dickies. They are basically a stronger chef pants. They do fade, but after a year or two instead of months. The material is even similar to good chef pants, only way cheaper. You can't beat it. They're more durable, harder to stain, and cost a lot less. Good chef pants run from 60-100 bucks and Dickies are 20 dollars with better pockets. Door handles and fryer corners don't tear these suckers. I must mention though, rounder chefs find them uncomfortable. They prefer the drawstring.
B007MD4MUM|5|beautiful in style and meaning,very sturdy and WELL MADE
B00AEMCJLW|5|This is so cute and practical - gift for my great-niece. Quality garment and 100% Cotton which is something I always look for!
B00G6OVL2U|4|I have the Safety Green (Green is the most visibal to the human eye) I Feel that it is too dull to call safety (If I knew it was not bright I would have gone with blue)
B00WL4UK8A|5|Perfect!
B0064Y7E50|5|I think I might have a long torso in the area from where the bra bottom in the front is to the back because I have to have it on the max length.  But I love these bras.  Have had previous ones and they last quite a while, that material is very nice, and I really like how it feels on my skin and body.  Wacoal is a nice brand. I don't like having to do the clasps, so the pull over top is great.  It is a nice design so that you can were v-neck tops without it showing.  Barely know it's there :)
B005JL6WDE|4|This is a great t-shirt for Queen. As I said it was a little larger than I expected, but it is still quite comfortable. The picture is more faded than I had originally hoped, but adds a little antiquity to the shirt. Overall a good product.
B00OTP5LC4|5|Very cute.  Not a tight fit.
B00CLCWZ08|4|Great belt, has the adjustable clip to fit many sizes but ,I find it to loosen at times but ,overall a great  belt
B00CDKWZJY|5|This is the prettiest shirt I've ever owned - the shade of green is so delicate, and the embroidery is perfection! The tiny sequins make it sparkle beautifully in the light. Because it doesn't stretch, I'd order a larger size.
B009EF1B0U|5|i Purchased this item because I was looking for a camisole to use for layering.. After viewinf how many colors they were available in, I ordered several colors,  The fit is perfect due to the stretch in the fabric. The lengh is absolutely positive and the adjustable straps are a bonus .  This item is perfect for layering or in warmer weather or climate to wear as is in comfort.
B00BIKZ6EQ|5|Adorable little headband for ages 3 months to 4 years depending on head circumference. Its very beautiful and stretches real well. Love it!
B0063KDX3W|5|Always good products.
B00ZUE1A5U|5|Very cute!
B00UWMHV8A|5|Am loving IT!!!! in the process of ordering more.....this is a MUST HAVE!
B00PW3CGVG|1|Ew,yuck,HIDIOUS!!!!
B00MW1L9SC|5|We are going to Frozen on Ice. I bought this tee-shirt in medium for my, slightly taller and larger than average, 6 yr old son. It still is a bit on the larger size, but I rather it be roomier than too small.<br /><br />The material is soft, and it's even tagless! That is a BIG PLUS for my &#34;itchy&#34; little guy.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy.
B00006VXX2|5|This is a great bra!  I am a 36AA and hate trying on bras because I never fill them out and they just bunch up, or creep up my back.  This is a perfect bra for wearing under a clingy sweater and it doesn't push me around and try to make me something that I am not.  The back and straps stay in place.  Wacoal understands what my first boyfriend used to say, &quot;anything more than a wine glass is a waste&quot;.
B00KRM4W9Q|3|Smaller than expected. Somewhat transparent which means this shirt would need a t-shirt underneath.
B00I12RGDS|1|YUK.  The fabric is fine, the fit is fine.<br /><br />BUT WHY of why did the manufacturer use a thick, hard, plasticky transfer to put the lotus on?  why not print it on with INK?<br /><br />The plastic &#34;iron-on&#34; effect is awful.  It crinkles, it's stiff, it's got a sheen that I don't like.  I washed it to try to soften it, to NO effect.  It's mine now, like it or not.  And I like it---NOT.<br /><br />If you want a stiff sign-like lotus on your chest go for it.  If you'd rather not crinkle, skip it.  SO disappointed.
B0002TOZ0A|4|If there was ever a  contest for the most comfortable socks I've ever worn, these would be a shoe in.
B001PITBJ2|5|I love this shirt and was very happy when I got it in the mail, I ordered a couple with different sayings and wow such fast friendly service.  Very high quality t-shirts.  Great sellers and Very FAST and Friendly service.  My package arrived in the mail the very next day.  Thank You!!
B00B6EA4MI|4|I guess I don't know what &#34;slim straight&#34; means. I thought it meant it was gonna be some nice fitting pants. I was wrong. Oh, I was wrong. These things gripped my legs and groin like no tomorrow. They were so tight that I couldn't button the top button without almost crapping myself. Not what I expected, but they're great for that &#34;I'm not sure what my style is, lets try skinny pants&#34; phase. Solid material, not stretchy, but that's what some people are into.
B00NXWX4XW|1|I read the earlier review mentioning yellow spots and figured it was a one off thing. Ordered anyway. Stupid me. The one I received also has a huge brownish yellow streak which covers about half the front on one side. The stain is impossible to miss. I'd stay really far away from this thing since two out of three reviewers so far have had the same experience, receiving a product with obvious stains.
B00E1BGXH8|5|I ordered this U.S. Polo Assn. Juniors Long Sleeve Striped V-Neck reason. However, when it received was very surprised - he clearly is the size of it of excellent quality, it has a good look. I'm impressed.
B00W2NQ93U|3|Size seems a little small.. The material is very thin
B00MA7ATWA|5|good
B0016L0TGC|5|The kids loved this!
B003L4YVGQ|4|These are truly the thickest, softest socks you will find.  My husband has worn these for years. He sticks with the black and the navy. Our most recent order finds that the \\"navy\\" are now \\"business blue\\" which were not to his liking.  Still hoping to find the dark navy as in previous orders.  Returned the \\"business blue\\" but are quite please with quality and wear of product.
B00NHO1OTW|5|This jacket was so warm and made for the perfect ski jacket. I would suggest getting your normal size as if it were the gap or any other US retailer. Size 6 worked for a size 4 upper body with a sweater and a two other layers underneath.  The customer service was also phenomenal- there were some product quality issues in my first order and they couldn't have gone to greater lengths to make sure that it worked out for me. I was very satisfied with the way they treated my case and did so just as well as when Amazon is the supplier.
B004LRO45K|3|This fits nicely and fishnet garments seem to be one of the safer one size fits all types of lingerie to purchase. It is delicate and attracts fuzz and hair which drives me crazy. I would probably look for something similar at a lower price since I don't expect it to hold up long.
B00LV557PQ|5|It is a Christmas gift
B008R7FGJ8|1|the sleeves are so narrow from elbow to wrist i couldnt get my rms through. i think they are cut/manufactured poorly. these are very thin also.really fit more like a slim fit shirt.
B0028OKUR4|4|I agree with the first reviewer's comment, that this is a nice shirt.  I have an athletic build and it's difficult for me to find shirts that accomodate my shoulders w/o being too baggy around my waist.  I like the fit of this shirt.  The shoulders and arm holes are a little wider, while the shirt seems to taper slightly at the waist. The fabric resists wrinkles and can be worn right out of the laundry w/o ironing. The metal Oakley \\"O\\" logo on the breast pocket is stylish too.  I can see myself wearing this shirt when I'm hiking, at the beach, or having a casual bite out w/ friends.  I like this shirt so much, I'm looking to buy another in a different color.
B00BLMC414|5|Great fit.
B000632SFG|5|Fit in any pocket. Warm and comfortable.  Great price too.
B009JYF954|5|comfy quality!
B0043ATLRQ|5|I bought this for my sister who was having trouble finding a butterfly mobile or set of butterflies that she could hang up in her new home.  Evertyhting she found was either for infants or just plain ugly!  I looked online and fond these Monarch butterflris and placed my order.  I had them shipped to me so I could see if they were nice enough to send to my sister as a housewarming gift and I was concerned because they so inexpensive.  When  I received thm I was amazed at how beautifu; and delicate they were.  So I shipped them to my sister and when she got them she was overjoyed!
B0037J5132|5|wish it was brass
B00HEBFZCQ|3|I would've given the shirt 5 stars, however the buttons are not as pictured. I ordered the black one and it arrived with bright white buttons - which I will be replacing.<br /><br />The bulky fabric in the center is sort of odd when buttoned up as well.<br /><br />Had the shirt not had these two issues, I'd have thought it deserved 6 stars rather than the limit of 5 as it is a great fitting shirt.
B002ONESQS|2|Costume its self was what was pictured and yet the goggles were different and looked broke gloves were not ment to fit a human. Way to big and hardly a thumb
B00M0J6GBG|5|beautiful top, great price,
B0016A90E0|4|Fabulous work pants! They fit and feel great.
B007VWXLIS|5|Hat was as described and the Med fit fine. It arrived very soon after ordering in a box designed for a hat so even though hat is crushable it came out of the box shaped as nice as pictured. Now I don't even want to try crushing it since I like it so much but it's nice to know the hat is durable and will always look great. I really appreciate the email order/shipping confirmations and the accurate tracking ability. Excellent service and an excellent product!
B00DSGDI2K|2|Asian sizing - otherwise it would be great
B005SZJ8YG|5|great fit and good look.
B00MMMSA6A|5|They are nice, warm and silky but what I like most is they are very roomy - sort of double gored, allowing a much more comfortable, nonbinding fit.
B00OLFOM6I|5|love it!!
B0072D7EGG|4|Thank You
B0058ZW438|3|I have a lot of NYDJ, and most of them are long enough that I can wear heels. These are shorter than I normally wear. I'm not sure if they are intended to be.
B00EKQEL9G|4|The look is adorable with a pair of jeans and a cute top.  It does run small, I'm a small in Express to give you an idea, no matter wear I buy a jacket I always but it a size up (medium).  So I ordered this in a medium and it fits okay with a light sized sweater but I don't think that you would be able to wear it with something a little bulkier.  I think I would have liked to have bought this in a large better.  Nevertheless, I still love the jacket and will continue to wear it regularly until I need to start dressing warmer.
B005Q3KQT6|1|this is very cheaply made, not at all worth $50 it shipped from Hong Kong so it is made like it is from there. The thong it came with reminds me of medical underwear they make you wear when getting cosmetic surgery it is very cheap material. The sizing is all wrong. I bought it a size up from what the size chart said to because of the review about the sizing being too small, it would fit my waist and bust but I can't even get it over my head and so I tried feet in first and I can't get it past my thighs. I would say if you are a women with curves or a little bubble in your butt, do not get this. If you are a twig stick figure then this is for you.
B005S8M8BI|3|Although the pins were nice they were very small. I wished they were a larger size.
B00DQFFK9W|3|Beautiful top  but not been able to wear due to the small cut.
B00ITKOW2U|5|I have never bought bra on amazon or online in general before this purchase. I was looking for something comfortable for everyday wear. This bra is amazing. It fits perfect. I wear 36 C. It is so comfortable that its hard for me to believe that i didn't spend a fortune buying it (which has mostly been the case so far). I am definitely going for some more colors. I haven't washed it yet (since i just received it recently) so i am not sure what the bra will feel like after the first wash. However, for now i am very pleasantly surprised by the comfort, style and the great fit.
B00MF9O1RC|4|Warm and cozy although not the best textured wool mix. The hand is not as smooth and soft but still a great set.
B00GICVPCG|1|This was made for a women the size of a small toddler. I am a small in everything I wear but this I couldn't even get past my kneecap.
B00BLRDUU8|4|Great shirt, good brand of clothing to use. Sturdy and washes well. Would package a little different as the ink does stick together in shipping.
B002K8PC76|5|Me gustaron mucho estas gafas, lo único es que toca esperar por lo menos a los dos meses para ponérselas poner al bebe.
B00GHHOKH4|5|This scarf is beautiful!  It's lightweight so it's perfect for the fall season.  I will definitely be purchasing a few more.
B00GX0JYHQ|5|Beautiful buy for hubby. Hubby loves this shirt. Colour and fabric is nice. Perfect for the office. Can be worn with a dress pant or even a jean at work.
B00L2E7E9I|5|Worked perfect for my Carl Grimes costume. Also bought the 112oz of pudding to make it complete. Walkers got my shoe. Didn't get me. I win.
B00K000I9I|5|Awesome shirt! Good quality, washed well. Slightly big but shrunk in the wash. Now fits perfectly.
B00FBCH2A8|5|It's a bazillion degrees in TX. These shorts are comfortable and lightweight. I normally wear size 6-8 woman's size ( I am a woman) , small fits great.
B0032CCYQQ|2|This was a nice product and what I wanted, BUT it is light pink and came on a black hanger which the black ink ended up being imbedded on the product.  Had to wash it right away and still have a big black spot on the pink socks.  NEVER got to wear them because of this.  Need to fix this before ordering these.
B000SKLT5M|5|i recomend this product ( low cut socks), every day my girlfriend bother me to change the old socks.  I feel very confortable with this new low cut socks
B006PI26FS|5|I used it in Spain. Its small, convenient, and safe. I also stored my money in here. Great product. Awesome.
B00HNMIK00|5|good
B00CIZJPVK|5|Fits as expected. Looks more expensive than it is.  Good bargain
B0018OSCKC|5|this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact. very very good
B00EVJRWY8|5|I love these socks. They are so comfortable and thick. These are probably the best socks i ever purchased. They arrived quickly and packaged nicely.<br /><br />I will definitely buy again.
B00306GBVI|5|good while driving, walking with my phone in my palm (no texting while walking)<br />Always good to keep some extra pairs.
B00CHSA7DS|5|Fast shipping, item as described. Thank-you!!
B00BRDDINA|5|My son liked these boxers,  he is a big guy and it is very difficult to find his size in the stores so these xxxl sizes were perfect.. He said that they are very comfortable and I find that  they wash very well.
B007XPI4I0|4|the terminations are very good, and it is a good quality Jacket. Colours are like the photo. It's what i expected.
B00HV6GIUC|5|I bought this to make a Todd Ingram costume. Fit well and looked great once I painted on a 3. The shirt is soft and a little stretchy which I liked.
B00KM2A73G|4|Lovely dress! Fits perfectly
B009390Q8A|5|Love these!!!
B00IO3VYNW|5|Hat fit great!!! I added some flowers for opening day at the races at Del Mar in San Diego CA.
B0014IXX4C|5|I bought this for a friend. I did underestimate (or overestimate rather) what size he wears. I ordered an XL thinking he was a Large and it would \\"run small\\" and/or shrink some, but he is a medium. Long skinny dude, so I figured he needed the length. Anyway, it was really big, but he wore it and said it was fine. Either way, when he saw it, it was blown away by it's awesome. If I ordered it again, I wouldn't worry about the sizing and just get him what I thought I should get him. I should have ordered a large.     Cool shirt either way.
B00BQ0VKDO|5|Love them! Feminine yet practical.
B00I6A6IV6|1|Looks nice, but the large is actually a medium.
B008EKN528|3|Had to return for a size larger. It fit everywhere but across the chest.
B00F9T624A|1|I cannot dissuade you from Lee products enough...I bought 3 pairs of Lee capris online and they all stinker like a mildewed warehouse...the corporate office was nasty and rude about returns. A terrible company that does not seem o like its customers...
B00061O5LI|5|I was concerned these wouldn't be classy enough for my nice tux, but they were great.
B00EZJIGA8|4|I love the style and print. little small by my upper arms. it is very pretty
B00B58GFK0|5|Excellent
B00NYK08YG|5|Fits her perfect.. The material is great doesn't feel or look of poor quality.
B00DR9HTQY|5|The tops look n feel great ! !  They launder up really<br />Well , no shrinkage. I would recommend to every girl<br />Out there buy!
B004K41TY8|5|I could not believe these fit so well. I am 5'9&#34; and weigh more than the package weight limit so I was a bit skeptical on the fit, but suprisingly these fit great and come all the way.
B00M30FFJG|2|Pretty color but material feels like a wrinkled rough sheet even after washing it a few times. It does say 100% cotton but I was expecting it to feel like my 100% cotton pjs from the same company. :(
B00B280WNE|5|I bought Nike, Adidas & Golden Toe, in the hopes of getting something that stayed on like these!  Nope!  Those will sit in my drawer, and even though they cost a little moe, I'm getting more SoleHuggers, because summer's finally here, and I need socks that don't pool in my arches!
B000TRJ0VO|5|Nothing needs to be said.  Just look at it.  Great detail.  Added bonus is that it's actually made in the USA, too.
B000BROCII|1|this was falling apart after the 3-4 use<br />the shipping was great and fast but because of the quality ... It was only 1 star
B0007X6DBU|5|These are great yoga shorts.  Comfortable and cool.  They never rise up or sag down and keep everything in place (for the most part).
B00CTUW8VS|5|i love it. material is ok. makes me have a nice waist. i love my under bust corset so much =)
B00NWNOLKC|4|Glad I ordered xl. It runs 1 size smaller.
B006L3V55E|5|I needed something for my dress shoes.  I was hesitant to purchase socks in fear that I would have to constantly be pulling them up.  These socks rock!  The grip on the heel prevents slipage.  I love them!  They are comfortable and fit well with the dress shoes I have to wear.  Thank you.  Definitely buying more.
B000REM3HW|1|This would be so awesome and impressive in size if it actually stayed inflated. Also, see how oddly bent the end of the gun is in the picture? Well, it's even more bent in real life. I tried taping the nozzle to keep the air in the gun since I could not detect a leak anywhere. Even that did not help. The gun deflated in about 10 minutes. I sent it back.
B000WN45WO|5|So much prettier in person I couldn't believe it. I can't say enough how much I love it. Tried it on and now I'm twice as excited for Halloween! Just enough sparkle and shine. Very delicate look perfect for the girly girl, or any princess. Stands perfect height to be noticed but doesn't take over your head. Excellent quality doesn't bend or look cheap. But also note this means you can't bend it to your head and the band is very rounded. But the size is great and the rounded shape will keep it from squishing my hair and giving me &#34;headband hair&#34;. The combs are perfect size and excellent quality as well. I have very thin fine hair and the combs will hold in any position I want on my head very comfortably and are the perfect size to tuck under your hair and remain hidden. The little dangle jewel is the perfect little dainty center piece. I couldn't be happier! Excellent value and arrived right on time with prime. Love love!
B009WLK8AA|5|That may be all I need to write.  But this is the best pair of jeans I've ever owned and I can't believe nobody else has reviewed them before so I want to say more.<br /><br />I normally wear Levi's 505 jeans, because after trying on all the different Levi's styles a few years ago my wife and I decided they looked the best on me.  For Christmas I asked her to get me a nice pair of jeans since I don't wear slacks and I wanted something for going out at night.  I told her just to make sure she didn't get them too skinny in the legs so I wouldn't look foolish.<br /><br />She ordered my normal waist size for jeans.  I was nervous when I saw that because they are a slimmer cut than the Levi's so I assumed they would be too small and make me uncomfortable or look bad.  However, somehow the way they are cut the waist (and the fact that there is a little bit of stretch in them) made them fit perfectly.  I am actually more comfortable in the waist in them than in my 505s.  And the legs are fitted without being tight or sticking to my legs. The legs fit much closer than the 505s but not so close that an ordinary-shaped man is going to feel like they are too tight.<br /><br />So they feel better and make me look a lot better.  Perfect!<br /><br />They are LONG, so we had to get them hemmed, so unless you are 7 feet tall, factor that into the cost.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I'm waiting for them to go on sale again because I'm used to buying Levi's.  If they go on sale I'll buy two pairs.  Even if they don't, I plan to buy another pair soon.
B00OKWTVSG|5|My gf loves them, and they have a great feel to them.
B00SNM5O80|4|A bit large but a great product. Well sewn and thin enough material for summer; ironed easily. Would say that it is wrinkle resistant.
B00SXY61Y4|5|Love the pants!!  Fits perfectly and very comfortable.
B00ABKSGGO|5|This Bohemia scarf is just the right length and it is super soft. I am so happy with this purchase!
B009POFUWU|4|Good quality and good fit.  What more is there to say except it coulda been a few bucks cheaper.
B00AIHRNJ6|2|Not long enough as indicated. Only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because I love Jessica Simpson
B007494P2O|1|When this arrived it was missing a stone in the center of the tiara but since the communion was within week I did not have time to return.
B0052XWG8Y|5|It's a good lifter panty really.
B00DF46CF0|5|Fit great look great too. Arrived in a reasonable amount of time
B004RBRPSI|5|I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend last Christmas. They came in on time, and he loved them! I think he likes that they're a spandex type of material so they stretch and stay tight on his leg. He could care less for the colour and design, but I think they're cute!
B001C4RC18|4|The product description said it was clear but it isn't. It does serve it's purpose though and I can still see the colorof my phone. It fits perfectly and the price is right. It came before the estimated delivery date so I was extremly pleased.
B003LNRNP8|5|Love it
B00F6CKPSE|2|The color is not the same as picture, material cheap looking and the size is not true to size.
B00CFGH4LU|4|While this dress arrived quickly,  the first was not made well, uneven shoulders and waist.  I contacted the seller and they resolved the problem promptly,  and the next dress was perfect!  I was able to wear it in time for event without alteration.  I am 5'2, 36DD and 128 pounds. MED was almost perfect! May take in waist later but that is only because I am large busted my waist is tiny.  Overall,  great company
B0050QISS0|5|will buy again
B00N5G9KBQ|3|Color is lighter than pictures and the fabric has no give. So standing it fit nice but moving was super uncomfortable.
B0009JE77O|5|Very soft fabric - medium thickness (not lightweight but also not too heavy). It has well-made bottom snaps and comfortable sleeveless design. The size is appropriate for the given 0-3 months age range. The tags in the neck are huge but at least soft (and of course could be cut off to avoid scratching baby's neck).
B007JAA4EG|5|We bought this for our 2 month old son's first Halloween. What a great costume! He was born with a full head of black hair so we didn't need to use the hat, but I am sure it would've been cute. We got so many comments on it at a Halloween party.
B002RGAAFK|5|Increases comfort without adding additional bulk that would require a bigger size of Vibram Five Fingers.
B003GWM4RQ|2|I expected the suspenders to look like the picture but the back is just one piece if you know what I'm talking about. Other than that they came on time and everything else looks fine. Only two stars though because it's not the same as the picture.<br />update:<br />I've only got to wear it twice before the little metal thing on it snapped off in the middle of German class! That was embarrassing! I'm glad we were doing partner activities though because no one was really paying attention to their surroundings. Still though I wished that wouldn't have happened!
B00XT459XC|5|Satisfied
B00J8C7R66|4|I love this jumpsuit and I gets lots of compliments. The only issue is that it's nearly impossible to go to the restroom once you are wearing it. The chain comes out of the neck hole and you can't get it back in unless you use a safety pin to feed it through. The first time I wore it to a gala and once I went to the restroom I couldn't get it back together so we had to leave. I learned my lesson the next time and had the safety pin ready to feed it back through.
B000W4S2HW|5|Very nice, very warm. Minimal hat hair, fits my boyfriend's huge dome without a problem. No itchy forehead. Highly recommended.
B003KGIZ12|5|I bought this robe for my son.  He is a big guy.  He wears an XXL in shirts.  I bought the 1X / 2X for him and it fits him perfectly.  It's a very well made and absorbent robe.  He uses a robe more like a towel when he gets out of the shower and, therefore, does not like the microfiber robes at all, even though they are lighter.  He loves this robe.
B000FBYYFG|5|Like it
B003VY7KYG|1|WARNING! This is not the real Columbia Bugaboo Woman's glove. Look closely at the product you are about to buy. It is not marked right. The real bugaboo liners and shells
B000SP6UVK|5|My boyfriend has size 14 feet and always has problems finding socks. This year around his birthday, I noticed he had holes in over half his socks and decided to go ahead and give these a try as a replacement. These fit him great and do not stretch out very thin when put on.
B00N72J66C|4|I am 5'9&#34;, a size 16 (42,32,45). The dress was light weight (outdoor summer wedding). I had to add black lace slip because it wS 3 inches too short. 5-7 and it would hit the floor. Got rid of static with dryer sheets. Curve hugging but comfy!
B00RSKKYZG|5|Love em
B0063OPY6M|5|Perfect transaction. My 4 year old granddaughter loved the jacket and with all the rain we have been getting, I am sure she is wearing this often.
B00J1Y3C42|5|Great robe. Love it
B002UIHVD4|5|Yes, they are expensive.  And YES, they are worth it.  Give them good care and these bra's will last a long time. Ever since I found a Wacoal at Nordstrom's Rack I have hoped to find one that inexpensive again; I have not, but I haven't purchased any other bra but a Wacoal, either!  Amazon will find you the best price.
B0018LYJRA|5|This thing is absolutely beautiful! The image doesn't do it justice. I have to agree, though, that it is sized more for a small- to medium-sized person. i wear a 14 pant and only have a few inches to tie in the front, but I guess I can think of it as an incentive to lose weight, which is why I bought it in the first place. It's too pretty not to wear!
B001SLFAW8|5|The concealing petals work fantastic.  No show through!  Im going to make this the only bra I wear
B00HANKQZY|5|Love it! Fits my 16 lb 3 month old big, but I wanted something for the winter that would last all winter, this is perfect!
B00EZKJ746|5|Bought this for my sister and it's so soft and fits so well on her. And it also came early, so that's a bonus as well.
B00GOGBGSY|5|I am very pleased with this product and love how the cotton is made. I think I got a very good deal while it was 70% off and the size can as expected.
B0018OMIOI|4|Ordered since I've worn these for years--these, however, must have used a slightly different pattern-- fit very snug for &#34;relaxed fit&#34;
B00EA4PQII|5|Received this in the mail today and LOVE this top !!! Completely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this sleeveless top ....
B00AMEZI24|4|Pretty good quality, although I think it could have been better.  Instead of a blue shirt, I received a black one, which I wasn't thrilled about.
B00HLC22KG|3|great item I ordered the same size in black and white and the black is extremely small and is made out of strong material and doesn't stretch much, looks like they would fit a very small person about 100 lbs or smaller in size. So kind of disappointed with the black set! Also shipping took a while and package arrived damaged.
B00GUDPOLQ|5|Comfortable, look good, and a step up from just wearing a T-shirt ( I wear them with levis or cargo shorts )
B006EVCT2Q|5|This is such a nice wig! It's really soft and it looks like it floats in the air when you walk. It is also not as long as I thought it was, but that's good. It also came with a wig cap to my surprise! The only bad things about it is that the color of the wig itself is kinda green and that the back of the base wig is kinda short. Other than that, this wig is amazing!
B00OJFRHLC|5|Perfect
B006J79X5Q|5|These are so comfy, I wear them around the house as well as at the gym.  The fabric is soft and smooth, and they wash well.  I think they run large because I ordered my usual &#34;small&#34; and could have used an &#34;x-small&#34;.
B00KOS6OBW|2|it's not good
B00B8H6PKS|4|Just wish they made them shorter<br /><br />I hate limits on how many words I need t  use, I will us as many or as few as i like so get off the edit train and learn brevity is best
B00AOUVWSK|4|Fits my pretty good, and it's a good quality maks. The coloring could have been a little better though. Fast shipping! ++<br />I recived it in Norway in less than week after I ordered. Good customer service as well!
B0089IAC80|1|i cannot put, xxxl is SMALL in USA.
B00ANKOOX6|5|I love this dress what else can I say. Very beautiful rosette details and such a beautiful pink. Sewn perfectly, no threads hanging or any part of the dress pulled. I think a pastel blue or yellow of this dress would look just as beautiful. Fit my daughter really well.
B005OFLSZM|5|Perfect, I would suggest going for a darker color if you're prone to leaving racing stripes!
B002MGB5CC|4|Good fit, material and price, but they are really long for a large.  I even double checked to make sure I didn't order extra tall.
B0087KOBH8|5|My husband prefers long sleve for motorcycle riding, and he loves this T-shirt which I bought for his birthday. We wish to visit the Maui HD Shop personally in this life. :)
B00EWASFQA|1|i wrote a letter a couple of weeks ago stating that the top to my swim suit was too small this is poor customer service because i have not heard back from you guys at all. i am very angry at this point
B0055QE8V6|5|I got this one on black, and it was a hit for my black dress which didn't have any accents. It made my dress pop and I love the belt. I am a size small and it worked great for me.
B006SFSDCI|5|Nice and silky feel, perfect under winter clothes.
B00CGV59VQ|3|These are very nice briefs but the fit was tight and even when I ordered a size up next time I will have to order two sizes up! and also long shipping time ordered on 11/18 and received on 12/28 wow, but customer service did keep me in the know when asking questions about order.
B010DMBQ2A|5|Lovely product met all my expectations. I'm an size 18/20 and xl fits good
B00ZYZ67EE|1|This shirt was NOTHING like the picture and the material is very cheap. It is also much larger than expected. I will never wear this shirt. Very disappointed.
B00NI4ULJK|4|The skirt hugs a bit if you have curves but looks great. thin material but the pattern hides all sins. Skirt's height is slightly adjustable depending how much of the top is folded over. Fun casual summer skirt. Yes, pattern does not line up at the seams but it works for me. I am thinking about buying other patterns. Delivery was fast and no problems.
B003LS1JX0|4|I really like these socks! I got these for a Halloween costume and still find myself wearing them around the house. My only gripe is that they aren't made of the strongest material. The heals are already starting to go out. Still, pretty nice socks.
B00MY5UEW8|5|Comfortable, thick but not too thick..
B0018OSM7K|5|I love Levis and I love the cut.  Shopping at all my brick and mortar stores locally I was sad to see that the Levis 557 were no longer in stock and the ones that I would find were the least desirable color/washes.  Thank you both Levis and Amazon for not only carrying this cut but carrying the varying washes.  I'm 6'2\\" 225lb and this cut is really comfortable.  I wear these to work and are still work appropriate yet are stylish.  The Levis store locally only carry the skinny jeans / similar or ones that have holes on them.  These were perfect and Amazon ships to APO which is a plust.
B00NC5OP7O|5|great product, smooth transaction. Thanks!
B00R557812|3|I chose these for hipster fits but they're  like bikini sizes
B00OZ6I8HM|3|My 10 year old daughter loves it but she won't be able to wear it very long. She is a Jr size small and really tall for her age.
B00COYNT44|3|Pretty cute light weight..
B00N25YFR4|5|Couldn't be better!
B002JY4JWU|3|Like many Halloween costumes, the quality is poor and this purchase is no exception.  However, I didn't expect the corset string to unravel at the end of the night.  I would not recommend.
B008LXTIW4|5|Very happy with this purchase, it is very comfortable and still looks great! Received several compliments when I wore it.
B005WUQYP8|4|I really like the hoodie just wish I would've order an xs. I'm 4&#34;11 110 lbs for those who are trying to decide between a small and xs.
B00NPGIY2W|5|Great fit! Nice fabric.
B00ABBUAXU|1|fabric  did not feel good. uncomfortable. Should have returned it
B001E7P5HG|5|Lee pants are the only brand that fits me well, and I have pairs of this style in several colors.  The indigo rinse ones (jeans) are by far the best  They are lightweight, super comfortable, nice fabric that looks a little more dressy than most jeans.  Have bought at least five pairs so far.  One slight negative is that the sizing varies a little from pair to pair, so I am always careful to try them on before assuming that they are the perfect fit.
B00D6KCF4K|5|Let me tell you, I used to have really bad judgment when using commas. One time I ordered &#34;Eggs, Toast and Orange Juice&#34; and my sarcastic waiter threw my toast in my orange juice, that was the last straw. I saw this shirt and knew it would be sure to teach me everything I need to know about commas. I can now dine with Mittens, my Abyssinian cat, without worrying about someone getting the wrong impression that I wanted to eat Mittens. I feel like anybody who struggles with day-to-day grammar needs one of these shirts to help them get by. Not recommended for wear inside of the local humane society.
B00TWKMA8Y|5|very comfortable, light, and great for summer wear.
B000UCP1K2|5|Perfect
B005174XVO|5|We shopped around for awhile to find a nice wool shirt. We even went to the Pendelton outlet and this was a better price! I highly recommend it for a snazzy look/camping layer. It is warm, but breathable.
B00755L60G|5|Lots of compliments on this shirt.
B004Q62A7A|3|its not a thick material. its exactly the same thickness as a tee shirt, or my underwear.  Therefore, I'm unclear what makes it moisture wicking.  its everyday material. comfortable though.
B00LSUG406|5|Best shirt I own
B0089ATURM|1|These were very poorly made, not at all what I expected for the money.  Sent back right away since when trying them on one laeg was too big and the other was so tight I could barely get them on.
B0001CYJP4|5|I was initially wary of buying a bra online without trying it on first, but I didn't have any luck finding what I needed locally, so I took the chance. I'm so glad I did - this Fancee Free bra is wonderful! It's very comfortable (no areas in it that poke), has great lift, and it's easy to unhook when I need to nurse. I did want to mention that when it first arrived I found it almost stiff, but after a few uses it has softened.
B001HL4BGU|2|My Santa is a big guy but this belt can wrap around him twice.  It is unusable and should have listed the size.
B006Z5U1GC|3|Ok
B008MFSKJ8|1|So i bought this one thinking (wrongly) that it would be ok for me (5'11 204lbs). It seemed L was ok for my body (i hit the gym 5/week). Guess what? If your arms are over 17 inches and your chest over 40 inches (like its my case), you will look like the incredible hulk is about to join the party. Not to mention that oversided traps will not help aswel. You may say \\"you are dumb you bought something small thats your problem\\" but no, thats not the case. The real problem here is that this product says \\"SLIM FIT\\" but not EXTRA SLIM FIT or whatever the heck was the name printed.<br />So there you go, i wouldnt recommend it, i just lost money and time on this one, got it delivered to chile so no way to return it.<br />If it helps, if you are skinny, this a beautiful shirt, so buy it.
B000N8THUS|4|These pants are perfect for me. They fit well and wear very well. I am extremely hard on work clothes, and for the price they are the best.
B00TATO1XE|5|true to size and cool for summer
B00RTAOJRE|3|It smells TERRIBLE. The buckle is nice, a little smaller than I thought but otherwise a decent product.
B00EFEPIMW|5|👍
B008C6U11C|5|Exactly what I ordered. Totally pleased with my purchase.  It was exactly as advertised by the manufacturer of said product.
B008P0M9G0|5|I love this dress! The material is so slinky and forgiving. And the style is an absolute classic!
B00DSVBR7S|2|The size says XL-XXXL so I thought they would be great for my growing pregnant belly. Turns out they are really just the same as the XL size I have in another brand so they aren't going to work for me in a month or so. If that wasn't disapointing enough I also found that they have extreme static that my other pair don't have so wearing them is super annoying since my skirt sticks to my leggs whenever I move. I only wore them once and probably won't wear them again.
B009WS5S2Q|3|This is an attractive leopard print, although the construction of this scarf leaves much to be desired, as the stitching in very sloppy. However, when worn looped around the neck as pictured, the flaws are not apparent. The fabric is extremely thin, so do not expect this scarf to keep you warm. It is merely an accessory.
B00CJQGO2G|5|Beautiful color and material!
B00IF27T4A|4|I was happy to learn that CafePress makes larger sizes inclcuding tall.  It fits very well and hasn't shrank like most t-shirts.
B00BHA941S|1|Too large and wrong color.  Returned/
B00L8WBEMW|2|It was cute, the top fit perfectly but doesn't have much support, but the bottom was way too big. I had to return it the day after it arrived.
B00D6CNMCC|3|Shirts are actually not sized right. A medium is really a small. The size is Asia sized from what I gather.
B001PU9A9Q|5|These are definitely worth the money.  I hate bras, so I've tried lots of different versions of these, but this brand is by far the best.  And they've lasted at least a couple hundred uses at this point.
B00AFY3U8A|3|This dress is a nice soft cotton material, but it's not a flattering fit. At 5 -6 months pregnant it made me look twice as big as I was!!!!  I ended up wearing it as pajamas!
B002G9UEHM|5|have several caps, I wanted the visor and this one is great. good thing my head is not big and my hair short, but works super for me and is NOT a death band around my head, Keeps my ears warm!!!! need it this year.
B00EOICRNC|5|Beautiful set
B000O7PB62|5|The Kenneth Cole REACTION Men's U-Turn Reversible belt is economical, smart-looking and long lasting. It is the perfect men's belt for everyday wear.
B00M2RBOLS|4|Much longer than expected,  but i don't mind, fabric is very thin,  so reserved for warmer months.
B00899XAVU|2|Very cheaply made.  I'm going to keep it because I really need a belt this color but I'm not happy with the quality.  Especially the extremely cheap &#34;buckle&#34;.
B00AJMGBQQ|4|Fit is small material is kinda cheap it looks ok on  I was hoping for a little better
B0099ICCXW|5|Love it, I still wear it around the house.
B00HL1G0N2|2|cute dress however the quality was not up to par as I would have liked it to be. The bottom looked cheap.
B00IN8AQ28|4|It fit well, except for its really short. I am 5'8 and it barely covers my rear end.  LOL...  I will wear with leggings and boots in the winter.
B000EDF1N4|5|I love this summer robe (duster). It fits well. Not too long, not too short. It has two large pockets. I love the fabric design and color, as well as the robe design. The last similar robe I had I used for about 30 years! I loved it so much that I wore it until it totally wore out. I had been looking for a similar summer robe in my local stores but hadn't been able to find one. This new robe is designed almost exactly like the one I had. And the price was so reasonable that I won't need to wait another 30 years to replace, if it wears out from frequent use before then!
B008SONN2C|1|Really didn't like the quality
B00DOPIE42|4|A bit wider than most for a 2x.
B00LVUT9S2|5|with this petticoat having elastic waist band it is very versatile in waist measurements
B00JLBFPNG|5|Great shirt. My husband loops great.
B00ARH8XWI|2|Very comfortable fit.  Washed and dried and didn't shrink.  Love the snaps on the back pocket flaps.  There is a cell phone pocket on the outside of the cargo pocket on the front right leg - very convenient.  Bought my first pair at a big box retailer.  Ordered second pair from Amazon.  Very happy with this purchase.  Update - After having owned these shorts for slightly over a month, there is already a wear spot/hole where the cargo pocket is on the right leg. This is very disappointing and is a huge product flaw. The other pair of shorts that I bought is also starting to show the same wear spot on both cargo pockets. I will not be buying these shorts again.
B00NFBX3JG|5|Great shirt!  Love the look!
B00835OUPA|5|Very cute
B0024YTCRW|1|By the time you put a couple of credit cards and a driver's license in the wallet not much room for cash
B005R3GLNA|3|I need to order larger size but size drop down does not show larger size than 4T.  Need 6T.  let me know if available.
B001EIT7UQ|5|Great belt
B00331IOGA|5|Bought for my dad after his last raincoat didn't hold up, and he loves it. It fits very well, looks great, and keeps him completely dry. Great purchase!
B00FIZYPXU|4|Size was a little small so order larger. Other than being a little tight in the shoulders I love it. It's also a little shorter than I thought but I still like it. It comes about to the belly button area and the front sides are longer.
B00ESZD00A|5|The color and fit for me. I will buy more. They are comfortable for a form fitting shirt. Very easy to clean them as well.
B006TC5AHG|5|I bought a black one and a white one and I love them both! They are incredibly trendy and cute!!! If you love hats you will love these! Definitely recommend picking some up! :D
B0087JB6J0|5|I loved this coatumed. It looked very nice
B00F65OSSE|2|Sizes are off u would need to get a size bigger than u normally wear
B002SDCEZG|4|I liked these. Very comfortable.  Would purchase again if the dress would have been what I wanted.  Boots were better than expected
B00F6OBJ0K|1|In the interest of fair disclosure, I didn't buy this sweatshirt, but I did serve on the ship.  The date for the commissioning is wrong by 2 years.  The ship was commissioned in 1976.  And the spelling of &#34;tyrannis&#34; is wrong on the shirt as well.  And the reproduction of the crest is pretty sloppy.  Sad that they didn't do a better job.
B00LU5KKYK|1|The coat is way too small , wrong color, wrong length, cheaply made, some one's name was on the front and it wasn't my son's name also a cheap patch was painted on the left sleeve - I am hoping this is the wrong item
B00PM5I7N0|5|Very good～
B005S2ADC0|4|Fits great.
B00N5JF18E|2|I purchased 3 pair for our winter trip up North. We were experiencing 10 degree weather and the gloves did not keep our hands any warmer than my $5 gloves I purchased to wear under these. The touch screen feature also did NOT work as our fingers were not warm enough for the touch screen option to work. I would not recommend this product to anyone that's looking to stay warm in any weather under 40 degrees.
B004VS0DOU|3|bought for a 96 year old Alzheimer's woman who doesn't want to wear a bra because they are all too tight thought this would a good alternative.
B00HT1V0VQ|2|Top was too small.The bottom was perfect it was high enough on my waist, but I had to purchase a larger shirt at another store. I generally wear a size 9 man and a 36DD. The way the top is made it could never be a fit correctly no matter what size it came in.
B00ET1V60Y|4|Great.
B00A02H5HE|5|Nice reversible infant hat! It's adorable, soft, and washes up nicely. It's a great size for younger babies (3-9 months), I had a hard time finding a sun hat for that age in stores.
B007850GBS|5|Amazing top!  I LOVE this piece and would highly recommend it!  Extremely flattering plus size cardigan! Creates the illusion of a slimmer waistline (or gives the appearance, even if you don't have a defined waist).  Comfortable fabric that's not too hot.  3/4 length sleeves makes it very versatile for different seasons.  Appropriate with dresses & jeans.  A great (fun & practical) addition to any wardrobe!
B004FWZUAO|4|I (a dude) got this as a back-up to the more ornate &#34;Long Nose Adult Venetian Mask&#34;, in case the latter didn't fit. I'm glad I did; this one was much more comfortable. The masquerade lasted for several hours and I was able to wear it the whole time. The ribbon ties can be tied tight enough, and the size was large enough so it wasn't constricting and small enough so it wasn't slipping all evening. The eyes are large enough that they didn't constrict my peripheral vision.<br /><br />The mask is labeled &#34;unisex&#34;, and it works fine as a men's mask. There is a subtle glitter effect but it is offset by the rest of the mask, which is solid and matte. I got several compliments and nobody questioned whether it was for men. Overall, not the fanciest mask around, but doesn't look cheap and is comfortable enough to wear for an evening.
B00BLV7VJ0|4|I live in NY and used this throughout the winter. It kept my face warm up until a point. If you breathe with your mouth open while wearing this, the condensation in your breath will collect on the mask. That condensation will freeze and make the mask very cold, which will make your face cold.<br />That is my only complaint for this mask. It fit well (I have a large head) and looked cool.
B00LFU41G8|5|love love it. Was exactly what I wanted
B00HXATNKI|5|I needed matching outfits for my 3 grandkids and I love I didn't have to leave house to do so  Thank God for Amazon Prime acct I have
B0007XTN8A|4|Great out fit. Runs ling
B00QKS5LGO|1|Super bummed about these jeans! They smelt like vinigar when I opened them from the plastic it was so gross.
B007O0FR9S|5|Super cute. Perfect fit on my 4 year old. She is a cheetah print freak! So of course she adores it.
B00CA2HO5U|5|Exactly what I wanted, very pleased with this t-shirt!  Perfect fit, color, and design.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
B00HFRGFDW|5|I love this shirt. Looks so pretty and I get compliments on it! :)
B00L2NOLMW|5|My wife and I went to celebrate our great granddaughter's fifth birthday... She wore this shirt... I wore a shirt featuring Olaf ... Been a long time since we've been in a place with thirty five year-olds running around... The birthday party had a &#34;Frozen&#34; theme complete with Anna and Elsa look-alikes, all sorts of &#34;Frozen&#34; decor and many of the children dressed up as characters in the movie... This shirt (and the one I wore) were huge hits... Colors are bright, fabric quality excellent, lettering and screen work superb... Most theme shirts are wear once and donate... This one is so well made will use it again and again...
B00MM2XYBG|1|This jacket does not look like faux fur! I have heard the Chinese are saying &#34;faux&#34; fur but is really dog fur! Amazon needs to seriously look into this urgent matter!
B000ZKJAMO|5|The silicon cover was thicker and fitted more snugly on my Verizon VX6900. The only bad thing about these silicon covers (not specifically just this  one) is that they attract lint and it sticks between the cover and the phone. So once in a while, i would just rinse the cover off with soap and warm water (of course without the phone in it).
B00JAKFL5K|3|&#34;Fits as expected&#34; is not quite accurate, It is shorter than expected. It is nice and roomy. You can have layers under it.. The color is exactly as pictured, but it does not show the very nice texture that looks like wool.<br />The model in the picture is shorter than I am. I am 5&#34;7&#34;. See how the sleeves blouse at her wrists? See how long the sweater is on her? She has to be 5&#34;4 or shorter. It fits, but on me exactly on the wrists. and above jeans pockets. .<br />I order big sizes. I try to find brands that run long. I can work with clothes that are too big but can't do anything with those that are too small or short.. I work in the cold and have to bend, reach, stoop, so I order clothes that are longer.<br />So, I guess that unless Carhartt has tall women's clothing, their tops won't fit me.
B00PQAYHJO|5|Fit awesome very happy
B00MJR2C1M|5|Absolutely adorable. Fits great.
B00F2MYBJM|4|Good quality. Very comfortable on both end. I like the vent in the back too. Super cute design. Wish a little traction on the form to make it perfect.
B00OO7RR60|5|The fit is perfect and I absolutely love it!!!
B003Y29HZA|5|these were long as advertised. lasted quite a while. were very opaque. if i could buy more i would - sadly they're out at the moment. I will be keeping an eye out for more of these because they were such a great product
B00RDQXIJO|5|Very cute and durable.
B00VZZNFCO|4|Skirt fits true to size. Disappointed it doesn't look like picture. Thought I would get the white petticoat that is shown underneath but not at all. Material is ok but thin
B00E64R9AU|5|It was what I wanted and was delivered earlier than I was quoted.  I was told 8 business days and it was received in 5 days.  The fit was great since Im a little bigger than a 7 and 1/2 and just a little under 7 and 5/8
B003ZSH8YK|5|They look good for any occasion and go with almost any color of clothing. I like it because they are casual.
B00EID4GNW|1|The pants came and they were very small! They were also see thru!! Very thin! I asked for a refund and the company was negotiating with me how much yo give back! They were nice and I was finally refunded but product definately not what was pictured!
B00DHKRQNO|3|Love the lace detail and adjjustable straps, but they fit a little snug. Smaller than the size guide stated. I wish I would have ordered one size larger.
B004Y6R61M|5|Very cute and flattering. I am 5'1&#34; and the length was good. I washed it to soften the fabric slightly.  It came out of the dryer without needing any ironing.
B007ZK3HAS|4|THIS SHIRT HAS BEAUTIFUL VIBRANT COLORS AND THE FABRIC IS GREAT QUALITY! IT DOES FIT A LITTLE BIGGER THAN THEIR T-SHIRTS SO BE AWARE OF THAT. I ORDERED A MEDIUM AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE GOT A SMALL BUT A LITTLE BIG IS BETTER THAN A LITTLE SMALL!!!
B00DQ59IUE|5|Some of you people are ridiculous. The top is beautiful and it fits well if you know your TRUE size to Asian sizes. These China stores are getting low reviews because some of you just  don't know how to convert your own size or you're just lying about your real size. Its not fair to them. It's not their fault you don't know how to shop. I give this store and the rest of China stores 5 stars because I know how to convert my own size to theirs and I don't have any dissapointments. Their clothes are perfectly fine. If you all can't accept it, then shop elsewhere.
B00AIBHHR0|2|What the hell is this I thought that it would be great to boost and lift your butt being that I don't have any problems in that area just need a little boost and this product gives u a look of  being deformed. Would not recommended this product to any thick in the hips  girls that  have a natural curve maybe for the skinn.. Bitches lol the only reason I gave it a two star because I have a flat stomach already and I like the tummy control
B00FPTSBWU|1|Says it is a woman's t-shirt but it is actually child size.
B005FIXPKO|2|Loved it when I first got it, but the bottom stretched out almost immediately and won't shrink back to the snug fit it was originally, even after washing. (I'm a size 2/4 and I bought a medium, so I am not stretching the thing out). Now it looks like I'm wearing a bag. Would not purchase again.
B00243FXLC|2|I bought this belt too big but made it work. The piece that goes through the hole broke off after only a few months (I had my previous belt for over 3 years). I was able to use pliers to re attach it but the quality is poor.
B00KCP7RUO|4|Should have ordered a slim fit. Big in the butt and thighs.
B000FGU8OC|5|Light weight hat to keep the sun off your head.
B00BY2XPVY|2|The shorts are made of nice material and look nice until you try to put them on.  Im 5'11 165 lbs with a 31&#34; waist.  I ordered the 31-33&#34; waist option.  It took weeks to arrive. When it did, I opened the bag and said....they look nice.  I tried the XL shorts on and the crotch was so high they were unusable.  If I pulled them up past my hair line,... instant wedgie and uncomfortably tight in the front (both visually and physically).  My wife couldn't stop laughing for 5 minutes when I tried them on.  It was pretty amusing, but I can't justify sending them back to china and can't really wear them.  The XL I bought was the largest size offered.  If you are my size or bigger they probably won't work for you.  If you are smaller than my moderate size...buy big...they might be ok.
B0065FF5KY|3|To be a coin change purse is okay. I just thought it was a little bigger. The color I got was way brighter than indicated. The zipper is a little hard to open. But I'm keeping it; for what I need, it's fine.
B00ACIH7UG|2|The legs are to wide. I had other one from hanes i dont need the type there was okay. Maby i find this anothe time
B009YRLI3I|1|Had to return
B005SW29O0|4|I will wear this all summer and with it being black it will go with any top. I Love it.
B002GHC5YY|3|I order XL tall and this shitprt fits like a blanket! Im not sure who the tall sizes are meant for but they are way to big. I should have got a large regular.
B00Q7PAMQY|3|the seams around the bust have these white stabilizer pieces sewn in. man are they uncomfortable. I bought 3 of these and the black one is the best. the back material stretches quite easily, but not at all on the black one. just saying.
B002QQ7TH8|4|Christmas present for my wife, and she tried them on.  The fit was good and true to her size, but they are pretty light weight, summer time type pajamas, so she really hasn't worn them much yet.
B00BBRL3BQ|5|Bought this for a friend that was expecting.  She adored it and it was in my opinion true to size.
B003JCZQT6|1|Only received half of the mask.  Cheap plastic.
B00F9LLUZ4|5|Looks good, seems to be well made.  I plan to wear fishing in the Florida sun.
B00KLTE9PC|5|Great<br />:)
B00FBD2G0I|1|Terribly cheap quality.  It's clear Hanes is attempting to meet a low price point, and care nothing about quality any more.  These socks are horribly thin.  It's disappointing when you can't even trust a name like Hanes any more.  Really disappointed that I wasted money on these socks.
B0056DK9DO|4|Great sleeveless, exactly what I was searching for to use underneath my white shirts.  Only con is that they are pretty long in length, could have been short but at least they wont slip out of your pants..
B00JQGJ9CO|5|The size it´s really exactly.
B00ES8XPNY|3|They fit very well and are uber cute !!! I love these leggings so much ! If only they weren't sheer-ish !!
B00BPFNEB6|4|a flexible fabric so it fit well. I'm 38d.  far less cost on amazon then at other online lingerie stores.  a real deal.
B00B6E9NZ2|5|Love,love,love! Very well made. Fits just right. Soft and feminine. Just what I wanted. I cannot find these in local stores so Amazon was the way to go!
B001FENH1E|5|These boots are great.<br />I ordered a size medium, which is a 7-8, i thought they'd fit. but when i got them home they were too tight. so i exchanged it for a large.(9-10)the service was great, i got them two days after i bought them online, and once i returned them they came one day after i ordered them. their sexy, stylish, and are great for my pirate costume. the heel is a great height, not too high, and not to flat. i thought these boots were going to be pretty crappy, and not made well, but they are just great. the only compliant i would have with this product is the price of the larger size. the first time i bought it, the medium, the price was around 27 dollars, and the second time it was 47 dollars. defiantly not what i was expecting, but i'm still glad i got them. again great service, fast shipment and just overall great product.
B00856LESS|5|SOOOOOO LONG!!! I'm so excited! i've searched all over the web and i've finally found these! do get them! the size fit me very well. i will be ordering in different colors
B00BGSMUWQ|3|They are very thin!
B00KDLOQ9C|3|Item arrived on time in good condition, however it is smaller than I had expected - it provides plenty of stretch, don't get me wrong but it definitely runs on the smaller side, the 1X is actually more like an L for a proper fit. Wish that it is available in a size larger but since it's not - I'm keeping it for future uses.
B009P9I3GU|5|Fits well. I have an &#34;I'm in the army now hair cut&#34; and this fits well. It's not too tight or too big. It fits just right. Very happy with the color, it looks the same in person as it does on line.
B005POLLQS|5|Love ordering from this seller. The spaghetti shirt is true to size and is very nice! I ordered other colors. Also it arrived in a timely manner and the price was right on!
B00925VEOA|3|I really like the hat, but I can't wear it because it's just to big. I understand I can adjust the back but then it's just fits on weird and uncomfortable. If there's anything yall can do to fix that, it would be much appreciated. Thank you
B008RMKN2I|5|Christmas gift for my brother -- he loved it -- its a nice medium brown -- not so dark it looks black and not so light that its off colored -- fits very well
B00OSJLDFK|5|Very cute!
B00SKAQ9U2|4|These are going to look great for our honeymoon. The womens extra large fit a little snug but I do have a large ches area so it shouldnt always be tight.
B003DVL0SE|4|Like the material, wish the collars were a bit stiffer from the rest of the shirt so they would stay up and look more presentable on the jobsite.
B00KZ1BGHU|3|Okay for the price
B004TERLF0|5|I love this robe and it is very pretty. It's very soft and comfortable to wear.  The fit is perfect!
B00157SXZ6|4|Got exactly what I expected. Though I ordered two and only one was in stock, that was the only problem. I love them!
B00VKF3UP6|3|some what large, but fun!
B007W0XRAG|5|I really love this. I placed both of them ( black and nude). They are well made, nice. I am a small woman ( event  too skinny). it makes me feel good when I wear it with my dress. Highly recommended.
B00P66GNYU|3|This dress is not made for tall women, I am 5&#34;9 and it just barely hits my ankle. Other than that the dress is a beut!
B00CC7F0ZE|5|I have not washed it yet, but so far I absolutely love this outfit. Great winter, holiday, picture outfit and fit my daughter well who usually wears 3m. Would buy again if it holds up in washer!
B00E41Y0CU|1|This is not the shirt that I ordered! The picture shows a dark blue denim shirt which was what I ordered but instead I got a light blue denim from a totally different designer and I don't know why?
B00J11XVAU|5|Excellent as expected
B00L3P0DLW|5|Beautiful socks that fit perfectly!
B0053HX6BU|3|VERY fast shipping, however it is not fit for an adult as the hat barely fits and the beard covers my eyes.
B000MOM228|1|I paid extra for expedited 3 day shipping and saw on the delivery information that it was going to be delivered in approximately 8 days time.  When I called them to ask about this they told me that they had fulfilled their part of the purchase and that I needed to call FedEx with MY problem.  I told them.. no.. I paid THEM the money and not FedEx and that this was THER problem.  Then the operator asked me.... what I expected HIM to do?  He told me he would check into the matter and reply through an email, an reply I never got.  Im tired of poor service from companies that dont care that I spend my money with them.  Never again.....
B005SICJZ8|4|So far these have worked quite well for me.  The conductive tips work really well, don't feel abnormally cold compared with the rest of the fabric and fit well.  I always get holes in the tips of knit gloves since most bought ones don't bother adjusting the finger lengths.  These do.  And by the way, don't knock a knit glove for having little holes at the base of the fingers -  it is a necessity to have increases there.  A needle and matching thread can cover the gaps.  I only wish I had bought a second pair.  Then I would have mending yarn if any tips needed re-knitting next winter and could see if a  matching fingerless second layer works for really cold days.
B00VWNLQ4S|5|Beautiful dress, I Bought it for my daughter and she love it!
B00AJD6NEK|5|A co-worker of mine has a leather shirt jacket, which is where I found I just had to have one of these. However, her's is not as thick as this one, &#34;her lose.&#34;<br />I LOVE LOVE LOVE this jacket, and Amazon even more so for the great price, NICE!  You'll love how soft it is, so warm and confortable you won't want to take it off. Don't worry about the fit either, just order your true size and you'll be fine. It even allows you to wear a sweater underneath without a too tight fit.<br />Oh, and expect a lot of looks from other ladies too, because it's unique in style, and that's just the type of fashion I love, uniqueness, which is what caught my eye about it from the start!  Trust me ladies, if you don't get one of these, you're losing out on something special. Wear it to the game, out to dinner, shopping, I even wear mine to work for dress-down Friday. Put it over a color of pants that really show off the shirt cut of it in the back - love it!<br />It makes a great gift idea too. And guys, you can't go wrong here, if you know her size, just order it, it'll fit great, and she'll love you even more for it. Have fun and enjoy wearing it ladies, I know I am!!
B0099JQMAU|5|This was my go-to piece of holiday clothing that was comfortable, looked good and his a lot of the flaws I acquired while indulging in holiday festivities.
B000N3RTL2|2|Way too long.
B004D69ZAI|5|I love these pants. They fit great. I am a little over 5' and they fit perfect. Definitely make spinning class more challenging.
B00800AIOK|5|Great work belt. Why ruin your dress belts? Excellent quality.
B0003DKV8K|5|These &#34;clip&#34; on to my belt securely and stay in place.  I use a wheelchair and these even stay on with all the scooting and sliding around I do.
B00917OTKK|5|great top comfortable washes great soft material
B00DWYI9MW|4|These socks aren't thick, the top reaches a bit lower than my knee, but I'm 5'8 and used to that in 'Knee socks&#34;.  The cuff doesn't cut too badly into my calf and yet holds them up, so that's a big bonus.  I've only worn them twice so far, but for the price they're decent socks.
B00YVESSNC|5|WAS A GIFT BUT TOO SMALL STRANGE FIT
B00LEWUIUA|5|good
B00UO226YM|5|This is a great robe perfect thickness and size. 5'10&#34; 210lbs fits great Im a xxl shirt size the robe is roomy.
B009QYQOB0|5|it's a thinner material, but I have received so many compliments about the top. it is quite versatile in the design because you can undo the buttons and change the neckline to suit you
B00YRLAEU4|5|the bottom of the sleeves are way small with no give in them. Other wise we love the shirt
B00M4UZ06S|5|fast5 shipping good quality
B004HG2F56|3|It's a great bathing suit. My only issue was that although it looks black in the picture it's actually brown and yellow.
B00G9W9YXC|5|Good quality.  This is a versatile blouse that can be worn with layers or beautiful without in warmer weather.
B00TKM51T4|5|I love this capris. They fit perfect so I went ahead and bought to more pairs.
B000OBXB0Q|5|I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH
B00GMNWGW4|5|The length prevents the bottom of the tank from rolling up during the day, which is great.  Comfortable and helps smooth the look of jeans under tops.
B00FXUP7A0|1|Came too small, and not nearly as long as you might be led to believe from the photo.<br /><br />If you're going to buy these, buy at least 2 sizes larger than you, and buy a belt (the one shown obviously is not included), and be prepared for the bottom to sit well above your knees.
B00HRWEB6I|4|Amazing! Love it
B00CLQLNXE|5|Super cute and soft.  Can't wait for my lil guys head to grow just a little more
B0060RL4AW|5|Love them!
B00I5V0J02|4|This dress is very fun & looks elegant when paired with the right accessories. Very &#34;Grecian Goddess&#34; looking! It is also pretty comfortable. One small issue, however, is that I expected a brighter more saturated coral shade & the color of the dress I received is a softer, more subdued shade of coral, almost a peach. Still a pretty color though, so I will NOT be returning this beauty! It will be sailing the Caribbean with me in a week or so, & I think the ability to pack one dress & alter its look with accessories & variable wrap options is a clever travel tip! It also doesn't wrinkle like most fabrics, so packing this dress is easy breezy!
B00V5PP8RE|1|No it didn't fit me, it runs smaller to the size you order.
B003ZAST6E|4|It is ok for the price.  It fit my 14year old and his friend. Only its a bit on the small side tight if you will. I would classify this as small men's large boys not standar.
B008XCIV7Q|5|I bought these gloves for my husband for Christmas because he always buys cheap gloves for himself.  After using these gloves once when shoveling snow, he raved about how warm they are.  So I decided to try them out, too.  They are not only ultra-dry inside, they stay dry outside as well.  The cuff is large enough so that snow will not get on your hands or into your coat.  I wish they offered the gloves in a few more colors, though.
B00BBWC9UU|2|I did contact the seller; they did offer to do a refund. I ordered it for a Thanksgiving hunting trip in bright orange and will use it and then put in the rag pile; no time to replace or return it now. A size 2XL T shirt should be too big for me; this is what I wanted in order to be able to dress in layers and wear a short sleeve T shirt under this long sleeve shirt and then have the freedom to wear these under a flannel outer shirt. This 2XL long sleeve shirt is tighter than any XL shirt I own and have washed out for a good long time.
B00SU6G9Z6|5|Beutiful. Way nicer than the picture. It's extremely comfortable. I am about 5'3&#34; and had to have it shortened a  couple of inches.
B001UIJMZK|5|As a college student I had internship interviews lined up and desperately needed to get a blazer ASAP. Living at a university in the suburbs, I didn't have time to go out to the mall in Boston to find a blazer. Thank God for Amazon Prime and Calvin Klein, I was able to get a blazer in my hands in less than 2 days. I was about to buy a blazer for 90 bucks online at Macy's (also Calvin Klein's) before I found this for 20 dollars cheaper which was AWESOME. While the one button was more cheaper looking than the Calvin Klein blazers in Macy's, I didn't really care. It did the job and I will certainly wear it many times. A great investment for a broke college student! :D
B00OALS8P4|5|It's fairly long – about hip length on me when not folded, and I'm 5'8&#34;. The colors are really vibrant and the material is soft and chiffon-y. Will be wearing this a lot, great scarf for the price.
B00765LBWS|5|I have this blouse in several colors and love them all. They are very versatile, they look great with a pair of pants or skirt and can also be used under a jacket or sweater. The blouse is very well constructed to last you a long time and it is true to size.<br /><br />As an Amazon Prime member I received free 2 day shipping on this blouse and it arrived on time in great shape.
B0083J7FE4|5|As described fast shipping
B000TJP2PA|4|The same shirt my husband wore for many decades.  It was probably well sized, but he had lost a great deal of weight.<br />We still love the hickory shirt style.
B00RXXGJ8O|5|Amazing bra at an amazing price. I do not consider it a sports bra. It would definitely not be appropriate for running. I wear 34 G when nursing and the L fits comfortably. I ordered two more.
B00GFS5AOM|4|It fits like a dream and the front faux wrap design works really well to hide the tummy if you are worried about one.
B00APDBTS4|5|I got this for my friend who loves the show and when she saw that I had one myself I didn't want her to feel left out so I got hers. and it served also for a great present to since it come very early. other then that she really loves it.
B00RY7WF6O|2|only wore it twice and its already falling apart
B00JKNZFX0|5|I love this shirt! Living in the deep south it gets very hot and humid. This shirt is light and airy. Love the color too!
B00F8A8TTQ|5|My 3 year old rushes home so she can wear this dress, its perfect for both play and sleep wish I could get more for her
B00NILHO3O|5|I ordered this jacket because my old one was no longer keeping me warm. It just so happens that I ended up booking a trip to Michigan mid-February after I ordered the jacket. The jacket came way before I expected it, which was great! Then the real test came, Michigan in 0 degrees before the wind blew and -17 after the wind blew. The upper part of my body which the jacket covered was nice an warm. My legs not so much, but my top, nice and warm. The bottom portion of the jacket was little tight, but the top was roomy.
B001D09SVI|5|Great wallet.  Leather is soft, holds all my credit cards just fine.  Only thing I wish it had was two window ID holders.  It only has the one. Other than that it is a good wallet, I'm happy with this purchase.
B00J39E0C8|5|Fits perfectly, well made, and comfortable. thank you for a quality product.
B007EKQMFQ|4|They work well and have kept my ears warm.  My only issue was that the case that held the 180's (not the Amazon box) looked crumpled so it appeared that they may have been used.  Hopefully that wasn't the case.
B00JJZ4H8S|4|Its really nice pajamas but sizes run way too small... order at least two sizes up!!!
B00AC3675C|5|worked great!
B00NNFP252|1|Ordered an extra large and it isn't super tight but it's not loose like I wanted either. There are threads hanging out all over the shirt and I don't even think I got the shirt that I ordered. My shirt does not look anything like the picture and is sheer enough that I have to wear a tank under it or else you can see right through it. I am not happy at all.
B003YYCMN2|4|Just what I needed.
B00MQJ7BMI|1|I ordered Large size and I received XL
B00JIHIO9U|4|Absolutely beautiful! Fits a little odd on the halter part {I.e.} Cuts a little too close in her arm pits making small red marks.
B00GYLD1DW|5|It's perfect it fits to exact size . It looks great with a pair jeans and boots.<br />I recommend it great for a nice cool evening
B00BR0MX3Y|5|Perfict Thank you Angelica M
B002SQIAAQ|5|These fit well and have held up well over dozens of washes and several months of wear.
B00EI3E6OQ|5|WOULD BUY AGAIN EXCEPTIONAL
B00HZHSR1K|5|I love this robe. I ordered it before I had surgery and I'm so glad I did. It is so comfy and soft. And it washes up beautifully.
B00ELC5832|5|Love this jacket. I use it everywhere, not just for the gym. The only negative is that it runs small around the arms, but I do have somewhat muscular arms. But everywhere else fits perfect.
B00NC5JXXU|4|Love the socks. They are a great buy!
B0059G01WM|5|I ordered this dress to attend a formal event. I am 5'5 155lbs, and big busted. I usually have a hard time buying dresses without trying them on, but I am overseas so shopping in a store is not an option. I followed the sizing chart and ordered a size 12 and it fit perfectly. If you are a curvy woman, this definately accentuates your body shape! I got compliments all night, it went about 4 inches below my knee. I love it. I recieved this dress OVERSEAS in 4 days!! I could not be happier!
B0037Z367O|1|I have bought the Hip Flip Cargo Flare Pants from Dickies since they came out, which are being discontinued. Tried these. They are cut with a straight leg, flappy, with big bum pockets. In a word, I weigh 110 lbs. and these made me look 130 lbs. and as dumpy as could be. I am sending them back.
B00KY72T3K|5|Very happy with this purchase.
B00JB1SIDK|5|(Size: Small) Ordered the sailor moon set, arrived at a reasonable pace. I'm small framed with a larger bust and the top fit perfectly. If you're under a D cup, you might have issues with this. I'm a DD and it still gapped a little on top.
B001E1GDIM|3|nice style and fit would definately recommend these pants for anyone to purchase for a boy to get dressed up
B00GBA47SY|5|this t-shirt is exactly what I have been looking for all these years. It is very expensive however I do my laundry every other day so I am using this every other day basically
B00IK3PNS8|5|Goof
B008HSI1JE|5|These shorts fit perfect and are super cute. I got many compliments on them
B00E59MNL6|4|This is a real Anne Klein skirt, (as some items are imitations of brand items) and the color matched a nice Anne Klein jacket I purchased at Macy's.  For some reason, in the last 15 years, the size of bigger clothes has become smaller and smaller.  This was a size 0 and way too big.  I had it altered to fit, so skirt size runs big.  This skirt has pretty front seams that curve from to to bottom,  and a back pleat, a little different than the plain suit skirt.  Mine is not as tight looking as this picture appears - it's comfortable.
B00HU24WGO|4|my baby is almost 12mons now, but is is too small~
B003H6DCC2|4|The fit was as expected, smoothes you out.  I just wished it had one of those stay in place liners at the top.  I liked the color also.
B00QI7DNWG|5|As everyone with children or grand children know cannot have to many socks or under clothing very cute great price.  Thank you
B0099RITAI|4|It looks exactly like the picture but it is really nice and is good material.
B00CHNNHFI|5|nice
B0026JEQLW|5|this shirt is unique and is very comfortable.
B007F52VB4|3|A Christmas gift.  I assume they fit just fine and hope they hold up the the antics of a boy.
B00DY7WEQ4|5|These are great socks, it's great they come In different colors, they look great with different outfits. Try them out
B006HLZJS4|5|Bought this to wear for a Christmas trip to Chicago with my husband. It's lovely and large enough for a tall woman like myself. While it's not &#34;genuine pashmina&#34; as some other reviewers have commented, I wasn't expecting much for how cheap it was. It doesn't feel cheap, it is nice and soft and doesn't have any weird smells from packaging. No defects in mine either!
B00SOFPG4S|5|Fits well. Beautiful finish
B005CSOIZS|3|It was a gift.  The fabric is of good quality but the size is way too small. The person usually wears a medium and this was so small I thought maybe it was child sizing and not women's.
B00JF14Q0U|4|Nice outdoor pant. Good for everyday use especially for traveling. I just hope that there's more color selection like Black color.
B0055QMTOE|4|Good leather product, just wish I'd have went a size bigger than my actual waist size. I have to use the second notch, which doesn't leave much room to tuck the belt into the slider. I wear a 36, so should have ordered a 38 belt size.
B00AQO119Y|5|My granddaughter is to young to wear the dress.  Hopefully she will be able to wear it in February.  It is a beautiful dress.
B00AQ4SHQY|3|This item was acturally very nice.  If you are a very small person, fantastic.  The item is cut very small for the size that it is showing.  If you weigh at least 175, do not order.
B0091QV30K|1|Big disappointment.  It's cut so wide and short I can't imagine it looking good on anyone.  Surprised at Jones NY for this.
B00QHMM0C6|5|This product exceeds my expectations. I have a similar jacket that I paid 8 times the price for and you can barely tell the difference in quality. I would advice against the detachable hoodie as I feel it cheapens the look of the jacket. Otherwise beautiful product and I highly recommend.
B00FSG4R8M|5|Absolutely love all things in Puma girls - for me - they were the short-side shorts, and my daughter did not like that so much. She has longer legs so perhaps that made a difference, but letting you Moms n Dads know, they are the shorter shorts!  Great quality, great looking for those who like the length will look super!
B005H0JHN4|5|Perfect size
B00BXPDCCO|5|Currently my FAVORITE shirt! Length is perfect and fabric is soft as silk. LOVE it!
B00BHHPXJS|4|Better quality than expected. Better deal than what I could find on Etsy. Onesie in particular is adorable, with sturdy material/stitching and a ruffle-bum (as the company name suggests). The headband fit my birthday girl well. The skirt is well-constructed. Baby Girl looked adorable.
B00DDVV63S|4|Works well I bought it use as slips for some sweater dresses that I have and they work great for that.  But the are a bit snug
B00CQ2G6OE|5|I read the other comments on the size and got two sizes bigger than i normally get.
B000PU6V2G|5|I had been wearing a regular ball cap for some time and wanted something a little different and found this hat and Love it!
B00HHTSOQY|4|Bought this for a friend whose baby is a bit bigger than expected.  She loved the &#34;full cut bottom&#34; shorts (she labeled it so) which made it easier for her baby to fit into.  She's only 7 months so it is a bit big in some parts but fits perfectly in the most important ones (legs, but and arms).  The colors are bright and perfect for summer (especially Texas summers).  I love the Nautica brand for adult clothes and the baby clothes are just as good it seems.  This was the perfect gift!
B004M52R8W|4|The days of quality rock n roll is here and now and to go back in time to purchase a new rock shirt when you ex-wife burned them ....well my friend is indeed priceless I love it!!!!!! And again no shrinkage LOL.....\\"George can't stands ya!!!\\"
B00A16KZKI|3|The full skirt and high waist combination make this a good candidate for a maternity dress. However, I am not pregnant.<br />Unfortunately it makes me look with child. has been relegated to the back of my closet.
B00U88EJCY|1|I love the shirt but it is too small and they would not let me send it back because it cost too much so now I have a shirt I do not know what to do with it.  Tks Amazon
B00MXRJIZG|5|Sleeves are a little long, otherwise great shirt quality and very good price for the quality.
B00IA8LVW0|5|I can't believe that it is so hard to find thin white socks that are sized just right. I bought them according to shoe size and they are a perfect fit. These seem to be well made cotton socks and I would highly recommend them.
B00IOIAISY|5|good
B0007YXS2G|5|Love them...and so pretty!  Awesome quality for the price! And super comfortable!
B003S3REEG|5|My son loves his new jacket. It's lightweight but keeps him dry when it rains. We can't recommend it enough.
B00NMUP1J0|1|Medicore quality  disappointing.
B00NJRX7FQ|5|Love it. Looks beautiful.
B00MGQ2ZD6|1|the top of the slit will not even cover your crotch!!! all my lady gems would be exposed if I dared to wear this dress!
B004Z8UPE4|5|Better than other brands. Easy for mom and baby!  Great sizing and arm hole size. Doesn't shrink when washed in warm water.
B00DJNOLUA|2|Not what expected, had defect strings hanging out everywhere and when I wanted to return it it cost more to return than to actual stem.
B00RO4NDHW|3|I bought this for my friend when she got married at age loved it the only problem was the metal rings don't come attached to the lingerie so be careful opening it and I was missing a ball to one of the rings on the underwear and that kind of ruined the whole thing.
B0057M5286|5|One of the cutest costumes I've ever bought. My daughter didn't like the head piece but what baby does... The rest of the outfit was absolutely adorable. Well worth the price.
B00F29TLUO|5|I adore this dress!!!!!! I am 5'5 and 150lb and I got a size 8 and it fit well but I also bought this dress in black but the black was too tight so size may depend on color. This dress is lovely especially for the price. I wore this to my senior prom and no one else had the same dress. This dress makes you feel like a rock star. Buy it while you can!!
B001CVCT2S|5|OMG its is so soft and lush, love it!! It is just as long as it shows and fits well.
B007KFYJC8|3|i wear a size 16. but in the 505s i am able to wear a 14 for a more fitting style. i thought it would be the same witht the 501s. they still fit, atleast these did better since the material is lighter than the aged perfect. but still a bit snug on the waste and hip area. maybe they would break in. i am not sure. am returning them for now. i have some old 501s when they were made in the us. i think the cut has changed slightly. the size 16 are a bit too baggy for my taste now these days but still comfy.
B009FV85FW|3|Order big, I'm a medium but size up.
B0083QLQ10|5|These are the perfect fit, I could not find the 4 hook in any store. Would love to packages with all the same color.
B00FN9LBF6|5|Great mittens! Accurate size (2-4) for my 2 year old. I also want to thank N'Ice Caps for IMMEDIATELY correcting the first order!
B009FV8I9K|5|I like this
B00K32XQJM|4|Nicer than I expected for the price...will order more colors. Good value.
B008JGIQQC|4|Very cute scrub top especially for us dog lovers!  Seems to be good quality too.  I've gotten compliments at work already
B00JJMMEKO|5|Love them, nice to have two options for one price.
B00DLLH2VA|5|I love these pants. They fit perfectly and the material is really soft. Also the length is very important to me as I am 5'8 and usually yoga pants end up being too short, but these were great!
B00QPICYJQ|5|Very Cute.  The top is seems to run a little tight but the pant run normal.  My 22 month old daughter loves her Minnie PJ's.
B00J5VOO3O|5|Great shirt fits as it says it does.
B002UKPU8U|1|Puchased this in a large and I was swimming in it. Wasn't fitted at all, I was very disappointed and returned it. Did not look at all how it's looks on the model.
B001CW6UFO|1|Runs way too small!  Normally a size 0 and ordered a medium!  It's not long enough and sits almost at neck level on my back while making my already tender milk filled breast uncomfortable. I am throwing it away. Spend more money and get something nice.
B000X98J6K|4|Was not what I expected. My son wasn't extremely excited about the Huge symbol and shaded effect.
B00FJB502I|5|Quality shirt.  Washes and wears well.  Design in awesome just like the band AIC!!
B00AQA8T2K|2|IT ONLY FITS AND LOOKS GOOD ON SOMEONE WHO HAS A HUGE CHEST. Otherwise, do not even bother. It is a cute shirt, but it just makes you look fat if you do not have big enough boobs.
B000JDAB70|5|The bow tie came in when I was told it would.
B002NSM8NY|5|Thicker cushioning around the ears. Great for keeping the ears warm.  Definitely recommend it if anyone needs to keep from getting earaches in the wind (warm or cold).
B00UR7HKVI|1|Totally sent me the wrong dress. Not even in the same color. Very annoyed and disappointed.
B00MZ86X3S|4|Super cute skirt!  The best part of me is my waist.  That is why I almost always wear a flared or A line skirt.  Usually waist area is NOT my problem but…..this is a pretty skinny and high waist.  If waist is a problem area I would highly suggest sizing up!  Kept it though I will only wear it on skinny days!
B00CYAVSUA|5|Love this sweater, I think all patty clothing tends to run a bit on the small side, so I always stick with a large, I'm 5'8 and the length on this is perfect. I have several pieces from her and always get compliments
B00SBT35WW|3|Initially they fit gone, washing they shrunk a lot. Beyond that, they're really nice comfortable shirts.
B00IUL740K|5|good quality. Typical Carhartt
B00PBFGMU6|3|Washed 1 time and the words on the back are already wearing off.
B000B8FBGY|5|If you know your right size it will fit and support perfectly. I bought it to wear under my wedding dress and it makes me look great even under regular tops. Came with fabric and clear straps. Very comfortable and well padded. I will be buying more fir the price.
B009ANTGJ4|5|I bought this footie for my 3 mo. old after hearing good things about them from friends.  My friends were not wrong.  I love this footie!  I love the fabric, it is 100% cotton and very soft.  I love the zipper (snaps make me crazy) and the zipper is supper easy.  I love the print (space blast) and the colors are very nice.  I have washed this footie a handful of times and it looks the same as when I got it.  All in all I think this is a winner.
B009IJOQN6|5|The fit is decent, relaxed fit, but not loose fit. If you've got hip and glutes, these will fit better than most, but may still bunch a little or feel slightly short-crotched, but not like a slim fit or classic fit. It's nice. Length is good. Pockets are great, dorn't stick out, one side pocket has a clean vertical zip pocket down low in front. Top side pockets are light mesh which is great. I'd normally wear nylon to hike in, but these can do casual and active duty a little better than most cotton options.
B003H2AEVS|3|This is fine for what we bought it for. Just a little raincoat for my son to go out and jump in puddles. But it is VERY thin. Certainly not the good heavy duty raincoat I had as a kid that could keep you a little warm and dry on rainy days.
B007FDSEJ4|5|Comfortable, well made hat. It has a snap brim so you can change the look some. Came with adjustment tape.
B00GCGVZ00|4|i like these i got a large but they are a lil tight... They are a thin faux leather the pic makes it look as if they have a lil wormth or thickness to them but not at all.. I still like them tho.
B00LOGT92E|5|Thanks!
B009ZWE618|5|This is the second one I purchased. After buying one for myself (in a different color), my daughter loved it so much that I bought one for her.
B000VEMUQC|5|This was a good buy at a good price.  The size was smaller than expected, but that was because I didn't check the details.  It works good as a sleeve patch.
B001OCQX1I|4|These shorts definitely run large. I have a 27&#34; waist and 42&#34; hips and usually wear a size 12 on bottom. After reading other reviews, I decided to take a shot on the Medium and they surprisingly fit. I would size down if you are pear-shaped because these shorts will likely be too loose around your waist in your normal size.<br /><br />The shorts themselves are comfortable and allow for free movement. They are slightly sheer because of the mesh, but that's simply solved by wearing a solid color near the shade of the shorts you purchase. They're good for both exercising and lounging around.
B00ATOR6A4|5|Excitement everywhere by everyone.  Thomas and Friends is a hit with all ages!! Good idea to get something else Thomas for the holidays.
B004XG4SUK|4|Geoffrey Bean make great sweaters that look and feel like cashmere, but don't have the $$$ price tag.  Perfect for someone like me on a budget, who want's to look nice and be warm.  Only downside for me is that occasionally the garments are shorter in the arms and torso than I'd like, due to my long torso. However, sizing up sometimes makes the garment too wide.  Still when I find a good one, they stay in my wardrobe for a long time and last for a long time, as well.
B003Y0343S|2|Unfortunately this dress is not flattering at all.  The length was great, but it was very boxy with little shape.<br />Make sure you really want this dress, because it is extremely difficult to return (Overseas).  Buy local!
B0081TULZQ|5|great
B004XJJSFC|4|Love this shirt.  Got lots of compliments and wanted to know where to purchase this.
B004DMWUVI|3|Probably should have ordered a larger size, and since there is no choice of chest hooks to use as in many other bras, the chest measurement is crucial.  Sides are short, so if underarm  back flab is an issue, this bra does not give the side support and coverage you need
B004SUGRC8|5|The shoes fit great, as expected, true to size based on the sizing of our toddler's other shoes.The price is right for shoes that will probably be grown out of within months.
B00AFBNYT8|5|...it's a little tight in the armpit. It fit's everywhere else like it was made for me! I get compliments on it every time I wear it!
B00M5CV9B0|5|I'm 5'9&#34; 185 lbs. I wear a 14 in jeans. I began this journey with a size xxlarge/40 then to an xlarge/38 I just purchased a large/36 and it's perfect! I'm on the first row now but based on my experience I'll gradually make it to the third row. (Fingers crossed) I noticed as the sizes get smaller in width they get shorter in length as well. Which I like. I ordered on Thursday, got it on Saturday. I actually ordered the wrong style at first! I contacted the seller SHAPERS_WHOLESALER via email that evening and asked them to accommodate. I received an email the next day and THEY DID IT! I was ecstatic! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wants to instantly take inches off their waistline. It's worth it!
B000OWF8VK|5|Super comfortable, love it.  I am a 38d who runs and I found that this is a super supportive bra.
B00MVMPS7K|5|Good product, excelent
B00CHW9A6O|5|If you don't like the way the top fits, size down.<br />I am 5'4&#34;, and usually a medium--the small fits like a glove, and I have no problems with the top slipping down in class, stretching, or inverting. They're long enough, too. Just so, so comfortable. Can't wait to order more.
B0050O4W46|5|great fit and the grandson really uses it.
B00ET1V2TE|2|No matter what I do, I can't get these to stay up! They roll down constantly! Sit down? Roll down. Stretch? Roll down. Walk? Roll down. They fit well. But as soon as I pull them up, they're rolling down. The lack of elastic or something in the waste band provides comfort as written in the description, but good luck keeping these on. I like the style, colors, fit. But I hate that they are so pointless to wear.
B00AHUP9WM|5|Exactly what I was looking for. A good classic black dress short that still has that little something. Easily cleaned and wears nice every time.
B003QOTMZ6|5|This is a very soft hoodie with a cute, bright color and pattern. My son looks adorable in it! I also like that it snaps, it doesn't bunch up like some zippered sweatshirts.
B0084ZAUSK|5|Stylish, Fits very good. I have been looking for an overcoat or tench coat and I tried several of them but fitting was the issue. This one fits me like a glove. I would recommend this product to everybody. It is warmest overcoat I have ever had.
B00H0Q3Z9K|1|I paid full price for this product but received a wrong color with different design.  I ordered a gray washed shirt but they sent me a blue washed shirt.  The funny thing is that the color they sent me did not even look like the blue washed color that they advertise here.  In addition, the shirt in the picture clearly has two pockets in the front but the one i received has 1 pocket on the right side of the chest.  Not did they only sent me a different colored shirt with falsely advertised design, they sent me a defective one.  One of the buttons was completely missing in the middle front so it is very noticeable when i wear it.  Since I do not have a same looking replacement button I can't even wear this shirt.  To sum it up: WRONG color, WRONG design and Damaged item.  Horrible shopping experience.
B00UBJ01JK|4|These are a good pair of navy blue shorts.  Not much else to say!
B003F8FIYW|5|Fantastic quality!  Soft, perfectly screened!  Great price!!!!!  I'm a medium but bought a large and it's comfy...after one wash might be a bit tight but that'll motivate me to work out!
B00PAMWIDA|5|nice shirt
B007GGC4OG|5|The dress is lovely--just as it looked in the picture.  My daughter is just under 5.5', and with her high heels, the length was just right.  We had it taken up just a tad in the bodice.  In front of bright light, you can see a bit through the white, but she's wearing it in the evening, not out in the sun.
B00SJ4X6SM|5|Very good quality! A little snug in the waist.
B00H86GXRI|5|I thought it might show under clothes but it is surprisingly smooth even under tops/dresses with unforgiving fabrics.  Very comfortable and cute.  The color is fun too -- light enough to wear under many different colors.
B00T6K12EI|1|I wear a size 6 pant but ordered these in an 8 since so many &#34;skinny jeans&#34; run small.  I could not get these over my hips & I have small hips. I am returning them for a refund.  I also ordered the Jag Hope jeans in the same size & they fit just fine!
B001DQ5YZ6|5|I honestly think this is the coolest necklace ever! I wear it all day everyday, the cross is a great reminder of what Jesus did for me! I get a lot of people asking me where I got this necklace (even nonchristians think its cool!)
B00475F0VI|4|The elastic is soft and doesn't cut into the skin. The top is a smooth type of material but the rest is see through tulle. It gives a great poof to any dress but on a maxi dress it poofs at the knee and gives a weird angle, so I wore it under a maxi skirt and then it was excellent. I also recommend short underneath it so that it doesn't cause the itchy uncomfortable feeling.
B0081P7QV2|4|It was as described. Got rave reviews at party we attended. The price was right for it also<br /> Would recommend.
B00BZ4B266|2|To small
B006GD2WVA|5|I was worried that this would look cheesy, but I was pleasantly surprised! It is thin, as it should be.  It also holds up very well no fading.
B001AV72UY|5|Our baby looks great with it, Im very happy with this wear... Nice fabrics and the box is so original.
B00J0A0UF6|5|beautiful shift dress, fits my pear shape perfectly. I bought a 6, but I am usually an 8 or 10.
B00GY0GRAW|3|It's fabric is thin so support is just ok if your chesty (D). Otherwise very cute and light weight
B00DEXLK4A|3|I've been wearing Jockeys for years but for some reason the perfume/fragrance<br />it's packed in is really annoying and hard to wash out.
B00B2L80HG|5|Pant leg and seat not oversized like many large waist jeans. Doesn't look like I'm wearing a tent. Very happy with these jeans.
B0082RSXCU|1|The tutu was see thru. It was also very flimsy. There was no fullness to it at all. There was nothing that I did to it that could make it look better. I did not even bother to wear it. Neither did the other person that purchased theirs with me!
B006ODTFBW|5|Bought this as sort of a gag gift for the hunter who has extremely expensive tastes, he was really excited!
B00AMDU136|4|They barely fit but thats ok. I should be in a sz33. Ive been working out and slackcing. Fitting into these jeans is my new motivation. I have stepped up my workout and cant wait to rock these comfortably.
B00QZ9HA7Q|5|I love it. It´s perfect.
B00XVQ0QUE|1|I don't recall posting a negative review until now. I understand there are different tastes for different people, usually when I don't like something I return without leaving feedback. What I can say about this product that could possibly be helpful to other customers, is that the fabric on the particular skirt I got, felt like thin plastic and it was completely see-through
B006RTV58Y|3|Was hoping it would be more like a jacket. Plus their stuff doesn't have bright vibrant colors- almost lays dull & wishy washy looking.<br />Jacket is still ok. True to size.
B001A674S4|3|The material is nice. The fit is not quite right. I probably won't buy this brand again. The color is a little different from my other chocolate scrubs.
B00HFJTOZQ|4|XXL is more comfortable and the inseam is longer
B00LE1GCT2|1|My son was very disappointed.. The hat shown in the picture is the one he thought he was purchasing, but it was not in the pack... You can not return so do not make the same mistake we did...
B0043D1CQG|5|I bought this jacket for $23, and it's well worth the money.  Totally waterproof, not very fashionable, but totally functional, this jacket is ideal for the worker in the rain not worried about trend setting.
B00SY6GTPW|3|love it its gorgeous tho i cut have taken a smaller size but its still cute tho the colour is not bright as the above pic but i still love
B00QX855BC|5|Great shirt, breathable, many comments.
B00VKXJAO8|5|The jacket exceeded our expectations.  It is well made and stylish.  Came on time for my grandson's birthday!
B005G6N6X6|4|My daughter loves this coat.  I did expect it to be a little heavier material, but it was still a nice coat for the price.  We live in a cold climate for the winters, so we would have her wear a fleece under the coat on really cold days.  I got this for my daughter thinking it would be big (we got it half way through the winter season) and hoped it would take her into next winter.  I do not think this will fit her next winter.  She was just over two years old when we got his for her, so I do not hold out much hope that it will fit this winter.  But it was a nice coat.
B00ABNEQGK|2|extremely too small and it was a 2XL...
B00RUYRMBE|1|Do not buy Guy Harvey Tee shirts off this site - they are sub-quality - Guy Harvey should be ashamed to put his name to this product. They are thin, and cheap, not Guy Harvey quality at all.
B00RKLQT1G|4|Ok so I was hesitant at first to order these because there is no size to choose. Basically you purchase and hope they fit. One size fits all doesn't always fit all. And I didn't understand the measurements given, they aren't very clear. But I'm glad I took a chance because they fit perfect and are comfortable. Most reviewers just state they fit but that doesn't help a person considering purchasing, so I will give you an idea of my shape to help you make a decision. I'm only 5 ft tall, smaller waist and larger hips. Pear shape and weigh about 159lbs. I usually wear a 10-12 in regular jeans. These fit me great. I can see them working for a smaller frame as well. I wouldn't recommend for someone larger than a size 16. They are very stretchy. But if they have to stretch too much they will become see through. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I was sent the wrong pair. I ordered the distressed look and was sent the ones with the pink rose on the back pocket and upper left thigh. I don't mind because I wear long sweaters and tunics with them so the flowers are completely covered. But still kinda annoyed I didn't get the ones I ordered..will try again and hope I'm sent the right ones.
B008DI3ZCQ|5|This hat is super cute, and was a steal. It will be perfect for summer and vacations to protect my skin!
B009L3B31C|5|it was a hit
B00MY5UEZU|4|Good but pricey
B0083SNCHE|5|Love these jeans! Fit is great & get lots of complements when I wear them.
B00L5FK2E8|4|A bit thin. OK for use when you are out for a short time. They are nicely stretchy, so comfortable and not bulky. If you are going to be outside for hours in cold weather (say, below freezing) for hours then these are not right for you.
B00F98TVTY|5|I've worn Thorlo socks for over 15 years.  I love the thick, cushioning feel of these socks and they fit great.
B000N8TJTC|5|These carpenter jeans are sturdy enough for work but not too heavy as to make them unwearable during the summers heat.  Highly recommend.
B00AFF9VEQ|5|very warm and comfortable and cute
B000FEC8X8|5|These are extremely comfortable.  They don't sweat, they are great.
B001JTARBS|3|Save 5 bucks go to caiman.com.I bought the large size gloves and there tight on my hands,and my hands are small.
B00BLPZHWO|1|Wig fit good but does not look like pic. The hair is much longer and yellow and the bun on top looks like 3 inches of &#34;something&#34; coming out the hair instead of a bun
B001H0F660|5|I got a large and it shrunk after a wash and dry just a LITTLE, no complaints though.
B005OFSJZY|4|The picture doesn't make it clear but the sides and the back of it are a stretchy elastic ribbed material and it closes in the back. There is no way to adjust it down so if you' re smaller than a size 12 or have a really flat stomach then this probably will be too big for you.
B005CSNWCI|1|WAY WAY WAY WAY weird. didnt fit well at all. didnt form to my legs, didnt look good. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!!!!
B0051D4H6Y|5|They were were a present to my daughter-in-law, and the jeans fit perfectly.  Lee Relaxed Fit jeans have been comfortable for both her and me.
B00DR9HM0W|5|Very cute
B007QYZVCA|5|Though the shirt was not a perfect fit (somewhat small), I absolutely love the shirt, and plan on buying a few more in different colors.  Of course, I will choose a larger size next time.
B00LUGQ2QY|5|The dress is a lot more attractive in person, very full, great quality just beautiful! Bought it for my six year old  fits perfectly and she loves it.
B003MAJKB0|5|I love these Levis!  They're slim through the hips, no bagging.  I wish they didn't have the pocket flaps in back, they stick out and have zero use.
B0070TONF2|4|My husband loves this brand of sleepwear.  This is our second pair in the past 5 years or so.  Amazon always has a great price!  The first one we purchase was at Nordstrom's and was a little pricer; but still worth it.
B0040MOIPW|5|This hat is a bit big for my 2 year old, but he loves it! :)  It's definitely a hat he can grow into!
B0058OQ1II|4|its beautiful and the size its perfect, the color are more beautiful present that its see in picture, liked too much
B00CPWBE4C|5|These are inexpensive, functional metal collar stays that work great with small neodymium magnets.
B00B554EBK|5|...but my cousin whom I bought it for loved it. she was crazy about it and said it fit great.
B0044MK23U|5|I love this shirt. Comfortable AND it looks awesome
B00CBEAQFW|1|I would barely think to consider this a medium us size. most large dress shirts are a bit baggy on me except around the neck. This shirt I could barely get on and I could button it but it would give me no room whatsoever inside of it. I am 165 pounds and medium build It looks like a very nice shirt but be careful what size you order cause the supposed sizes are misleading. the only way it could be considered large is for a very very skinny person. I am returning it as it is useless to me and I am scared to order a bigger size cause I have no idea which one would actually be a good fit
B005IUN0WM|5|I bought the green & black shemagh and love it. This shemagh is really excellent at keeping the sun at bay
B00HVA73NO|4|I bought this for a dressier need, but since then it has worked well with jeans and even made me feel a little more put together. It's a great heavier weight and super high quality. I love it.
B00TASJ4QY|5|I received today and so happy and very satisfied with the quality. Very light but well made fabric and center has Velcro opening with string tie.<br />Opening area, there is fabric so even if you open velcro there is stretched fabric. (See photo)<br />True to size ...I bought a bit tight size for me (trying to lose weight) so it was great to have inner fabric so you can adjust with strings for tightness but don't show opening area weird way thanks to this black fabric! Great price for quality!
B00AB3CEIC|5|Loved the shirt!! Sooo funny!! Would recommend this for others.just what I was looking for for a big foot enthusiast!
B00HUOQV8O|2|It was cute but it had a small stain on it and fit small.
B0072DEWLG|3|I thought the leather would look thicker and have that leather smell of a good brand. This was a present and it was good but I really thought it would be of a better quality. It's very plain which is what I wanted but at the same time it wasn't that thick leather I was hoping for. I would say that this product is okay. If you're looking for something without embellishment and a plain black wallet this would be a good purchase. Arrived as expected. The box it was packaged in was a little tacky box which was also slightly disappointing. In summery it was an ok purchase but not exactly what I hopped for. I think next time I'll actually go to the store so I can see them for myself instead of going by pics and descriptions.
B0087ZI3X6|4|This coat is warm and cute!  My son watched a 45 min parade in it in 30 degree weather without one complaint of being cold. He looked about like the stay puff marshmallow man but looked cute and most importantly stayed warm.
B002AQ1IAS|5|I love this dockers pants. Are wonderful. I do recommend it.<br />It fits perfect. they were not expensive. and really satisfy to me
B00F5SF1L0|5|These mittens are perfect for me. They are very warm because of an inner lining and the color is just like the picture. I would say my hands are average size, maybe a little smaller, so if you do have unusually big hands than these might not work for you because they are just the right size for mine. Fur appears to be durable so far.
B0034DOMZ4|5|I was very pleased with the quality and price for this specialty item. I needed it within a week of ordering, and had already begun building my alibi for not having received it on time. I was extremely relieved when it arrived at my doorstep within three days of my order!  Thanks again.
B00OGS3KZO|5|I love it! It's so soft and comfortable!
B0009GCTLS|5|they were too big for now.  but in a few washing they will be fine for him.
B00Q42N4RE|5|Love it
B004FJH6AE|5|Great buy! Very warm and perfect color to match all my outfits! No regrets, and very happy with how it looked!
B00CQRH1U2|5|I love this outfit.  Fit doll perfect
B008JJOU2S|5|I ORDERED THESE A COUPLE OF SIZES UP AND THEY FIT COMFORTABLY. I DON'T LIKE CONSTRICTING PJS SO IT WORKED OUT PERFECTLY. I ALSO FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF A REVIEWER AND WORE THESE PJS, WITH THE HOOD UP AS I ROBBED A LOCAL GAS STATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE POLICE PICKED ME UP 2 STOPS LATER AS I RODE THE SUBWAY. I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY KNEW IT WAS ME, I REMOVED THE HOOD. ANYWAY,  THE DROP SEAT HAS COME IN HANDY HERE IN JAIL, IN MORE WAYS THEN ONE.BUBBA HAS THAT LOOK IN HIS EYES SO, I BETTER GO, BUTTHESE JAMMIES ARE WARM AND COMFORTABLE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B000V87LDU|5|Love it. Great for hats
B00MA91YGI|5|Great price, great material. My daughter loves it!
B007W9ZVME|5|Was scared to buy because of negative reviews but the dress looked great. I'm really happy. The material is thin but considering the price that's not a problem.
B00HWJXVO4|5|It does fit a bit snug and the elastic is tight - if you have a large hip it might be snug getting over your hips. It hangs really well - I'm also going to try it with a petticoat. I'm 5'4&#34; and it hit at my knee. I'm a 26&#34; waist and 36&#34; hip and ordered a small. It sits nicely a bit below my natural waist but is a bit snug to get on and off.
B00K2SLPPY|5|I love this coat but I usually wear a small and found that this coat runs very small.  I reordered one in a medium and I love the way it fits and looks.  It is light weight but also very warm because air does not get into the sleeves.  I would definitely recommend this coat. Just remember to order one size up.
B00KE4JFEO|5|Brought it fir ny daughter and she  Loved it it was her favorite color
B00ACIFP64|4|Fit great however the shirts weren't as long as some of the other Hanes Tees I have. This is only an issue because I find them coming untucked quite often under my dress/work shirts.
B001MLDMTC|5|they fit well, always good to have gorillas on your ankle while cycling
B009046LU0|3|Nice swim shorts but they are sized small. I ordered a size up & I'm glad I did
B00JCUPW3E|5|This is the first time I am writing a review for an item bought on amazon.<br />These handbands are absolutely amazing. My baby girl looks so gorgeous wearing them.<br />The band even looks prettier. Worth every amount.
B00HI0I58O|5|Great shirt I love it fit perfectly
B0072IAU6W|5|Very comfortable, an I definitely dig the button look. Got over zippers an this gives a better comfort level in my opinion. Speaking of comfort this jacket is 9/10 . The vest look is nice an Dosnt make noise like windbreakers when you move around, therefore this jacket is super dope.
B0040NP7ZG|2|The first thing my gf noticed when opening the box is that it gave off a weird industrial chemical smell, the size is also too small. This iwill be left in the closet indefinitly.
B00RZUAL7U|2|It's ok
B00BCH9TVG|4|The socks wick away moisture well enough, I just thought they would bleed away the heat build up too.  Otherwise they are a good value for the money.
B00ICU3PA2|5|This was so perfect for my Dad, his grandchildren and great grandchildren all call him Papa.  Good quality and he loves it!
B00CL5EK08|4|Bought this dress as a dress to kick around for an evening while in Jamaica.  I heavy on my top and this dress helps insinuate my figure.  I would recommend it because it's comfortable and it fits well for someone that is either curvy or has either larger on the top or bottom.
B00IT6M2YO|5|Love love this purse. The two tone color which I got the blue and black is cool. The purse size is just right. If your looking for the perfect purse. This is the one. It comes with the beautiful scarf also. Five stars all the way.
B008ZHDEZS|5|because it is a great product son loved it
B00A3KR47O|2|The clips are pretty hard to open and close, it hurts your fingers to take them on and off, especially if you hand are cold.  I wouldn't buy again or recommend.
B00453PKC6|5|I bought this for my son and he loves it. He wears it around the house and I was worried it would be to small but since he is skinny, it fits him perfect.
B00BIS06AW|5|Awesome mater and VERY cute!! My daughter gets many compliments at the gym
B003YM898G|5|I have had Goeffrey Beene shirts in the past. They feel and look good. Amazon is the one place I can find them as I am stationed overseas. Again, great shirt and would buy again.
B003NX8C2O|5|It's a vest with a nice fit.
B00EZBYTVQ|5|Got this for our daughters birthday and she absolutely loves it! wears it almost everyday!
B00J4WH6GG|2|my daughter loved this jacket - but the first time we washed it the side seam split about 3 inches and the material frayed making it almost impossible to sew back together
B00CLVVP50|5|I don't want to offend any Jewish folks, but I am well aware that this says - 'new covenant' and I can live with that.  I don't intend on using it as a 'jewish' item.  I am borrowing the idea of a covering while I pray.  It is so well made and it comes with a tallit bag, closure is a zipper.  If I could afford it, I would have preferred one made of wool.  However, all this being said - I purchased another one like this for a Christian friend of mine who studies the Old Testament.
B003DTMPP8|5|Great product.
B00LO1YJRE|4|that is ok， but the color i could not hold
B00LFPMAWK|5|loved it
B00VU2G0YC|1|Was not true to size. Impossible for me to wear. Unfortunately, my son threw away the receipt. The screen print looked cheap. I was expecting a lot more from a $30 shirt. I am extremely dissatisfied.<br /><br />*I held off on posting this review as the seller asked for. I submitted feedback to them first. I never received any acknowledgement from them. Therefore, I am submitting my honest review here. Save your money.
B00I98I3RW|5|Pretty dress!! My daughter loves it. Got it in blue.
B004CO8Q4M|4|I am a women who usually wears size 11-12 athletic shoes. These socks are great for me, but too small for my son who wears mens 13's. Great quality, wash very nicely.
B00IPBQYYW|3|32 Is still to tight for me and I'm thin.  Plus the zipper popped off so.. perhaps there should be a size for the waist as well not just the length of the pants. plus not jeans more pants like plus if you wear white itll make it gray and rub all the black onto it.
B009DJCM8W|4|Comfortable for those of us who do not need a lot of support.
B007R8JGBW|1|I just you get what you pay for! Horribly uncomfortable! Couldn't even stand to wear it for 10 minutes. The material is scratchy and there's no support at all!
B00C6U0H6Y|5|Perfect costume and it fits like a glove. Very stylish and everything I wanted in a costume for a renaissance fair.
B00A3M4ZRO|4|Luv this hat it fits just right! My head is small :) I have to order another one. Price is great and seller was prompt I'm completely happy with this hat!...
B00MOEH35K|5|Awesome but are slightly smaller and the white Is thin cotton taping so looks different in person
B008DI3ZCQ|5|It is perfect! I love wearing it and is very flattering! The hat is super cute and goes with any of my summer dresses, shorts, bathing suits, etc.
B005YUZCQI|5|Excellent fit!  My husband is overweight and has normally wide shoulders. This vest tapers in slightly at the hips so it looks great and not boxey
B0088GEJ9Q|5|Ordered this for my boss...I teach at a school whose mascot is the Cardinals.  Colors black and red....he really liked it....really high quality material.
B00I9O8RK4|4|My son is slender and I wanted this for the Monster Jam show we were attending in a few days so that they would look like fans.
B00DYSV5WC|2|I wish it had said this instead of measurements, the measurements were not accurate. But it's a gorgeous skirt. I'm going to add elastic to the band, its gorgeous!
B00JWLUHVK|3|Levi's we're just a little too small. I will be returning them for a larger size.
B00L4KHWWY|1|After two weeks of use,  theseams are already falling apart under the arm pits.  If i would have known this is the quality of product i was going to recieve i would have gone with another brand.
B0043C0PII|5|Love the bra!!!  Have it white and wear it to the gym and wanted a black one.  I especially like the front closure so I wear them all the time.  I never like the ones in the stores you have to pull on over your head and squeeze into them.  My original one was a post op bra but they are my sport bras!!!!!
B006GCRWOS|4|I got this shirt for Christmas and it's so nice looking! It looks just like the picture, and the little lace details are so pretty! The problem is, I am a solid size Medium (28 inch waist, 36in bust) with small shoulders. The top kept slipping off my shoulders. I could send it back for a small, but it would be too short. If you have bigger shoulders, though, this will fit you well. I still wear it frequently with a tank top or camisole underneath it. It definitely needs something under it.  As you can see from my name, I'm very picky, so I have high standards. A taller person (I'm 5'2) would look better in this shirt. Don't get me wrong, I wear it all the time!!!!!! It's comfortable and detailed!
B00V9WB8BI|5|My boyfriend liked it, it's very soft
B00TF1C3AA|5|Love it
B00LN0HGKS|5|Perfect for pear body shapes.  I get compliments each time I wear it.  Bought size 6 and it's form-fitting but not too snug.  I'm 5'5'', 155 and carry most of my weight in hips and thighs.  Material is textured which folks find visually appealing.  Most often folks want to touch my fabric!  More cranberry than bright red, and perfect for work environments, especially with a black blazer.  I wouldn't feel out of place pairing this with booties for a work party either, as the exposed gold zipper gives it a little sexiness.
B00CL8M8OK|2|My son saw a hoody identical to this one in Children's Place and had to have it. I wish Children's Place had had his size in stock because this one was a poor substitute. Zipper wouldn't even work.
B00KHCGQ2C|5|Alot better than I expected. Fits extremely well and is very comfortable! Going to order more colors soon.
B00DY0DCMG|5|Love them, super comfortable and affordable
B003N5P39C|4|Really nice quality material, soft & comfortable as well. The shape was a little boxer fit for a woman's polo than others we have tried, but over all a very nice product.
B00KTMRL6A|5|👍
B002DXVO6Q|4|yes I said it. I was rolling around on the floor, bent over to throw up a few times, my dignity in question but the whole night it did not rip at all. I still have it to this day, hiding in my draw of same. worth the purchase
B00XYPBR3W|3|It's nice.
B004M5LHN8|5|but slim too! Who would've guessed?  Aaaand... it ties itself into wonderful shapes!  I made mine into a snow goose once, and my wife got into 4 fights that night with women hitting on me.  Do yourself a favor, buy this magical sartorial garment of wonderment!
B000I2KWVM|4|it was a little shorter than i expected, and the buttons popped off, but i sewed them back on.  also the straps were too long and drooping, so i shortened them.
B005HBJ10M|3|Very cute. They lined the driveway for Halloween. However, you have to be REALLY close for the motion sensors to go off and make them hoot. Next year they will have to go on the porch instead. Great price. Wish the motion detectors were more sensitive.
B00841RF2S|4|I got the product in good condition and since I'm petite (5'2) its bigger than I expected which works well for me.
B0043VDHUM|5|This is HUGE! Very stretchy, plush and cozy, perfect for autumn and winter. It's like wrapping yourself up in a teddy bear.
B00JJGB10Y|4|I bought this exact shirt at wallmart for $7.50 for my finacée and he's in love with it even though it's two shirt sizes bigger but he still loves it and wears it
B00EYNI8TY|5|Very nice pants. Good quality as we are used from this brand.
B002G9UEJ0|5|The person that got this hat for Christmas was happy with it. I'ts kind of hard to go wrong with a hat.
B00JR047NK|4|According to the sizing chart, I needed (and ordered) a large.  These are very roomy pajama bottoms, and I think a medium would have been a better fit for me.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fabric is extremely lightweight...great as summer PJ's if you live in a very hot climate.<br />Kind to super-sensative skin.<br />Do not shrink if laundered as recommended.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Fabric creases easily and deeply and thus becomes unsightly very quickly.  But, hey, they are pajamas, so no biggie.
B0038M1XW6|5|We love this leotard.  It is beautiful, high quality and fits great...IF you order according to reviews and not the manufacturers sizing.  My daughter is a size 6 or S and we ordered a M (8-10) and it fits perfect.
B009GU3LA6|1|The sizing is right on for me. The first problem is the amount of coverage-it's too much. The panel between the cups is so ridiculously high on my chest that when I wear my v neck shirts, it shows. I don't even know what purpose it's supposed to serve anyway. It doesn't help to control bounce whatsoever. It seems like a modesty panel at most. I'm all about modesty and no one needs any cleavage when working out; however, this panel serves no purpose and it shows! The second problem that I noticed is that the seams show underneath my shirts. Between the panel showing and the seams poking through, I would be so embarrassed if I had to be seen in public with this on under my clothes. Finally, this does not control or eliminate bounce. The fit was perfect, but all the other problems made this a no go and I'm returning for a refund. Very disappointed.
B009KC4DNY|5|Super soft comfy tee. No itchy tag and wish we had ordered more! I have to peel it off my son. Runs a slight bit on small side.  Delivered very quickly also!
B00CEH0WLY|3|Comfortable
B00L8WBEMW|5|This swimsuit is great. Fits wonderfully (please get the next size up) the bottom does fit as described. It is a great purchase. Looks great -feels great.
B009QCSVKY|4|Warm and really good design quality. Very happy with it.
B00ATVFHPS|4|This was to replace an older suit that was just getting old. I like the fit and style. I would buy again.
B00ACIH9UE|5|Not bad for the price at all
B00331D1C2|5|Traveled a LOT!<br />Took it to EUROPE, ASIA and used it running around CANADA. The jacket can also be used to protect my leather jackets when it's raining somewhere in Paris.<br /><br />Works well too during adventure times in Hawaii.<br />Not too hot and protects my skin from the wind when trail running.
B00387F3I6|1|Bought this belt because it looked nice but the product is not well made.  Have worn it for about a month and the keeper has fallen apart, which also means the buckle is fallen off and makes the belt pretty much worthless. Would not recommend this product or any other by this company.  $40 for a piece of crap.  Will go back to my $20 Levis belt that I have had for years.
B00P9BNH1E|5|The hat is great, just what I wanted. Just have to be careful with it since the knitting tends to want to pull out a lot...and for some reason I didn't expect it to have a hard bill, but it's nice nevertheless! Shipping took a long time but that was expected. So overall the product is very nice.
B001ANBHJE|5|The quality of this shirt is unbeatable compared to its price ... very good product, I recommend
B00BZIO5BQ|5|I love this bag ! Is very ellegant... The price is excellent... Is a very good purchase... I am so happy
B003VHW3KO|2|Had backpacking for 35 miles with this socks. Got huge blisters on both feet. I'm not sure this is for hiking. I may try 2 socks (one thin & one thick) next time as I did before.
B000UZRG0W|2|I have purchased other Waycoal bras in the mall and loved them. I ordered the same size in these and they mash my breasts. Both the band and cup size are smaller than my other bras. I wanted soft cup but I wouldn't have minded a wire. The band in not supportive enough without one (a wire). I am passing on this bra altogether. Will not both to try other sizes
B008UHAF1O|5|This dress is sooo cute! I love it, it fits perfectly. It also really shows off your curves. Great price, too!
B004QF0TI8|5|My men are living in these socks. My husband is a mailman in Nashville and its cold. They are thick  and warm.
B00FF5AI1Q|5|I ordered a couple different leg warmers and these ended up being my favorites.  They looked good on and the fake fur moved nicely when I walked.  It had a realistic look and changed the look of what I was wearing a lot.  These had a little more upscale look.  I was very happy with my purchase.
B00GO0FPIW|3|is cheap. For the price it's not bad, but Is nice
B0019T1V4K|4|The Buffalo \\"Game\\" are my favorite jeans. I wore out the only pair I had, and found these on Amazon for a great deal. I purchased two pairs, but when they arrived, they were labeled \\"Game-X.\\" Note that the Game and Game-X models are slightly different and this product is more or less mislabeled.    Fortunately the cut is the same, so I ended up being okay with them. I still prefer the Game model, but if you're buying this item right here, note that it is Game-X, which are different in fabric.
B00C9VZ3R8|4|It was excatly what I expected. Looking to buy some more shirts from them. RVCA Is a new Faviorte clothing brand that I like to wear. They got the styles I like for the &#34;On the Go&#34; type of person that I am.
B008KE4Y6O|1|I ordered this top in 3 colors. For some reason, one of them came as a more fitted top with long sleeves? The 2 short sleeve were fine and like the pic,  the long sleeve didn't fit. Not sure why they sent a different shirt. For the price/shipping not worth the hassle of returning.
B00R5Q8DTC|2|Don't do it. Cheaply made with thin material and the slip is a completely different length than the dress. Also much smaller than anticipated.
B00201ER88|5|fit my 3 month old with still some room to grow! love the adjustment to fit around her head =) great for the price.
B0064Y46Q0|4|Very glad I read the reviews before ordering. While I love the fabric and the style, I am definitely glad I ordered an XL instead of a L. Also as the reviewers stated, they do run quite short. While they fit the waist, butt & upper legs really well, they do gather quite a bit behind the knees - makes me feel like I have elephant legs. This is probably due to the sizing issue. I find myself pulling that area up quite often. Overall, I'm pretty happy, but I wish clothing suppliers could find a more standard sizing across the board instead of each supplier being different in how they interpret different sizes.
B002APXKVO|5|This style of Dockers fits and suits my husband's physique well. It has a classic fit that is not too baggy in the rear and leg area but still gives him the comfort and style he likes. I just wish they would offer a darker Khaki than the British Khaki as an additional color, and a shorter inseam selection.
B003IPUJUA|4|Shipped fast.  The hat is awesome, I can't wait to wear it this summer!!! Everything I was looking for in a hat.  Most hats run small for me this was a perfect fit.
B00KJAU60A|5|These are great!  I was expecting a more &#34;cotton-y&#34; feel -- these are a bit more dressy in the feel of the fabric.  BUT! they are SO comfortable!
B004M38PVW|3|One of my buckles broke the first day. Need em for work tho.
B00HPO6X5K|2|Cute top, but way to much room in the chest. I wear a DD bra and was very disappointed in the extra material through the top.
B009SAZVTI|5|NYDJ jeans run true to style and size...they always fit once you find the style you like in the size you need.  A fan of NYDJ
B006II6FP2|4|For the most part I like this coat. I used it for the first time yesterday and we were very warm. However, I could not wear a thick sweater with this coat or my arm would never fit. Other than that it is warm and the material feels great.
B007KF1S0Y|5|My 6 year old loves these socks.  They do a good job retaining their shape, even when his feet get wet!  Wash and wear well.
B005GVCG2S|5|Fit as expected, were comfortable, wore them recently on a trip and I loved them.  Arrived as scheduled, would recommend these for anyone.  Loved it!
B000KEOZJ8|5|What else can I say? They are as expected.
B00AIBGGLS|1|These are very expensive pj's.  The fabric feels so soft, but I'm a size 14, bought extra large, and they shrunk so much that I couldn't even get them over my hips!  I was pretty angry about it.  I don't see them on the Barefoot Dreams website, so hopefully they've discontinued them.  What a rip off.  What's so hard about pre-shrunk fabric?  I had to gift these to my toothpick skinny neice!
B002LFBRV8|4|this was pretty fun to bring to a halloween party. by the end of the night it had been mysteriously confiscated by someone who had bigger and better plans for it. perfect purchase for the limited use i needed it for.
B00CF6MMKS|1|The bottom is full, but the top is very tight.  The picture is nothing like the product I received.  I'm a 42C, and usually wear a 24 or 2x.  I went up a size based on the reviews and still could not get this to fit.
B000QYBNVA|5|I purchased 2 of these dresses and I love them!  They fit great!  Plus, they can be dressed up with accessories or worn casual for running errands!
B00LY0HCVU|5|Love them.  I got the Orange and they are much cuter than I even expected.  Super pleased with this purchase.  I also received them very quickly.
B0061Q56JW|4|The feel good, i ordered the size I wear in Levi's. The waist and length is great just remember the long stride in the crotch. A lttile too much room. I love them though.
B00ATTGIJE|2|We purchased this suit for my 13 year old daughter and had to return it. It was much smaller than expected, rode up in back and was too small in the bra area, even though she has a teenager's body. You should keep this in mind when ordering.
B006UX6QPO|2|I usually wear a large pant size, but I got an XL just to be safe in these. They were still incredibly small. I wasn't able to wear them at all.
B00A17JYVI|5|This is a great item!  Offers the support I was looking for without bulk.  Reasonable price.  We'll see how it holds up.
B00KBLD24O|4|The color of this dress to be deeper than the picture but not 100% cotton
B0037S7EEW|4|Needed some shorts for hiking and camping.  These will work fine.
B00KFAWL5C|4|A little tight in the body but sleeves were appropriately long, excellent condition on delivery
B00ND90RSA|4|Got compliments for it!
B006EXU2RS|4|It's a really good hat it keeps my head warm an it is really soft I'll be ordering another one soon
B001HNHUMA|4|It was a bit big for me, but I installed the included sticky pad around the inside brim and now it fits fine.<br /><br />Definitely crushable; it traveled in my suitcase both ways and is still in great shape.<br /><br />The only problem I had was the thong came loose and I lost my &#34;bead&#34; somewhere in Manatee Park, so I'll have to figure out some sort of replacement.
B00GRLVW12|2|It's definitely order up or so!! Sending this back so hopefully I get the right size. Fabric seems nice though!
B007KZREMU|5|I am very pleased with the purchase of this item.  It is exactly as described and pictured, fit is perfect and quality is excellent for the price!  I plan to order more colors if available!
B00ICR979S|5|I absolutely love this top. Love how it falls, I bought a 3x and it's fine. The waist is stretchy thank god. If it wasn't that would have been a problem :)
B00EFLM2WE|5|My girlfriend looks hot in it. Waa waa wee woo!
B00A6YTKGA|3|So, I got them rather quickly (3 days) and they came in today. I tried them on & they're full, ankle length leggings. I'm 5'4. They fit & feel very nice though.
B00IUEVXFE|5|The only type of underwear I've purchased for the past 5 or so years is CK in the various lines.  While I've had great success with many, I truly feel as if the CK One Microfiber is the best of the group.  The fabric in my opinion is superior to that of the cotton variety due to it's ability to withstand multiple washes over time  Just as important is the flexible bands within each leg.  Many make the mistake of using a 100% cotton here, which simply stretches to size and then bunches up uncomfortable for the rest of the day.  These keep shape, over time, as well as being insanely comfortable and breathable.
B00AS4R6Q4|4|I really like this hat! It's different and really cute! For some reason I thought I ordered the white one and was kind of disappointed with the beige, BUT I got over it and will just go back and order a white one. The prices are beyond reasonable especially since it is spring now, but I say stock up while you can, and you'll have them for next winter! This picture makes it look like the pom-pom is HUGE, but it's not, that is just a weird picture.
B0091JE7SM|5|This was the perfect costume for the asian ancestor for our Middle School production of Mulan.  Great look for the stage! Satin shimmered under the stage lighting!  Really put the kids in character once they put it on!  What a HIT!
B001OMP79M|2|The product description says it comes with a cummerbund but, that's not true!  In fact I had to order this Tux twice because the first one was too big and on both orders, no cummerbund!  Other than that however, nice for the price.
B008YDEOTI|5|very ideal for outing
B00FZDXEEQ|3|The fit was what I expected, a little on the long side.  Disappointed the fabric was not jersey as described which is why I purchased them ( I have the cropped length of this same pant that is jersey).
B0007TFRNE|5|I bought this as a gift to my uncle. He had one when he was younger and has been looking for one for a very long time.
B00LX7GH38|5|The headline says it all, I was looking for a cute, slightly plush costume for my 2.5 year old and this fit the bill perfectly. As others have noted, the head piece is slightly large. I had to tie it under my daughter's chin then velcro the ends. But she loved it and didn't want to take it off! If also should keep her warm once I get the pants & shirt to go underneath. I'm very happy overall and so is my baby!
B007AK1LW4|5|Bought as a gift for someone who loves socks. they love them!<br />Comfortable, fashionable, didn't shrink much.<br />GREAT cape on the back. hilarious.<br />Cotton and breathable.
B00SMRN88Y|2|The nose support hurts my nose after wearing it for only 1 hour...  I have many other sunglasses that I can wear all day without it hurting my nose, :(
B000RN04WE|5|Love it, love it! Need to purchase another since this one has been so comfortable and my other ones don't feel the same. Gives great smoothing look under t-shirts.
B00BKRNGPS|1|doesnt fit
B00B79DS52|5|My daughter loves these undies.  She always wants characters and she loves superheroes!  I would buy again! These are a nice change from princesses.
B00TIZA602|5|It is a very sexy pajamas.
B0053FL506|5|.el producto me parecio de muy buena calidad y el envío llegó a tiempo, por lo tanto considero que dan un buen servicio.
B00NBJ0SA4|5|I love it! May order another one because if this ever gets ruined I would be too sad!!!!
B000F2254M|5|Well, FYI : bought size L, am 5'3&#34; tall and my weight is 155 LB, usually wear bra size 36B, fits just perfect, not to tight not to loose (except the inserts but hey yay, if u dont like the padding take it out). The padding is great, my boobs look fuller. Wears comfortable without wires. Exactly a strapless bra &#34;bandeau&#34; under summer dresses what i was looking for. Can highly recommend, a good quality and great simple style :)! Ordering one in cream nude color as well! And believe me i did tried a plenty of different styles already, decides to go for the simplicity.
B00DURCDHS|2|The first thing my 17 yr old said when I gave it to her &#34; is it upside down?,  no the flag is facing the wrong way. Very un American.&#34;
B008OPZPV2|5|I've now had these gloves for over a year, and they've performed excellently. I use them in several of my costumes, and they have stood up to long hours at conventions and outdoor festivals, and look great besides.
B00H6PGAJW|2|Smelled weird so i gave it away.
B00GPGO72U|5|Love the jacket but for skinny people
B00ACB6GU0|4|Love the single giant flowers!!! Wish they were sold separately. The other ones are kinda goofy looking because they stick up so much (think unicorn horn) My daughter is only 4 months old, so maybe she'll grow into them. The pink/white/red bunch is really cute too!
B006MP3SE2|5|Nice pants. They fit as expected and have nice cargo pockets for the e tea items my son carries around with him. Good price, too. I would recommend.
B00H8AG1WQ|2|There is just no way I can hide these things. They show through my pants. Instead I bought the rubber belt which serves the same purpose, and I am very happy with it.
B006R7FMOE|5|I love this shirt, because of the show, and I'm going to wear it all of the time.
B00DNPTJ8S|5|Exactly as I expected it will work great!
B000H8MCLU|1|This came with no bell.
B003BZJESU|5|I am so glad i found these. Victoria Secret stopped making the style that fit my shape and I have tried so many others but were uncomfortable.  these are just wonderful. I where these thongs more often with slacks - no lines - yippee!!!
B00F6PNY7U|3|Practical
B000T8LQTW|1|I ordered this wig because brown haired wigs are kind of hard to find. This wig is VERY dark brown, if not black. Because it is unisex, it is also kind of bulky. Doesn't look much like the picture at all. If you want the wig for something other than a hippie, I would try to find something else.
B005OFLTE2|5|👍
B00NE7CBBM|5|Very comfortable with nice fit.  Wish it came in more colors
B003AU5VZQ|5|I got into running so I had to get some running shorts. I decided to get these Army issued freedom fighters. They did not fail me. These are not for the shy runner. If you're planning on picking up a pair of these, then you better be ready to have your t-rex quads and lower butt cheeks  in full sight of who ever is around you. In case you're wondering...Yes, you do pull eyes from the ladies. The fabric is okay: The first layer is very sheer, but the second is what keeps your bait and tackle snug and safe and out of plain sight. They're PG shorts and safe for public use. If you do get these you shouldn't be wearing a undergarment. it will only make you more uncomfortable during the run and ruin a truly free experience in which I can only describe as American.<br />As for the size: I'm a 32 waistline and the medium fit perfect.
B00PK6ENMA|5|thank you !!
B00MGNJ9YC|2|runs very small I'm only 5'6 129 pounds and medium, barely passed an appropriate length. If i bend an accidental flash is bound to happen,
B009G9A9J8|5|killer hat
B00CL4306O|5|True to size. Beautiful, rich color. Fits nicely, thanks to the elastic back. Wishing they had more availability in the colors advertised.
B00CH50DT4|1|I USUALLY WEAR MEDIUMS IN DICKIES SCRUBS SO I BOUGHT LARGE IN THIS BRAND ON THE ADVICE OF ANOTHER REVIEW. THE TOP FITS NICELY, BUT THE PANTS MUST BE MADE FOR SOMEONE WITH NO BUTT OR HIPS. THEY ARE SO TIGHT AND LOW RISE, THAT I DON'T DARE BEND OVER WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING IN COMPETITION WITH THE PLUMBER. I WOULD RETURN THEM, BUT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE WASH :-(
B001DNWV14|5|I got this to fit a new MacBook Pro 17-Inch Laptop and they look perfect together.<br /><br />There's plenty of room in the Xander for all the extras needed to carry along with the Mac.<br /><br />I got the Xander because it's listed as having the room for a 17-inch but I gotta tell you it's kinda snug but it does fit the computer minus the Neoprene sleeve.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Dr Koffer for a while now and this looks great next to my other Dr Koffer bags.
B000I9PCYC|4|This is an excellent product, although a little high priced and received in good shape.  My husband and I were well pleased as was our granddaughter.
B00F467HYC|4|Its a really nice, comfy material and cute! The only issue is when I wear it there is some bunched lace on the outsides of the cups by my armpits
B000RF62UA|5|Great shirta for work and they looked great to wear all the time and they work in some slightly fancier situations if you dont have anything else which i dont.
B001U96BXK|2|The &#34;Royal Blue&#34; is really a neon blue. You can't tell from the photo, but the one time I wore it I got so many &#34;WOW THAT'S BRIGHT&#34; reactions from my friends that I felt self conscious.
B005OQ02RQ|5|This sweater is exactly what I needed. It's the perfect mix between ugly and adorable. Super soft and warm. Looks exactly like the photos. Fits great (I got a small). Would recommend for anyone. Money well spend.
B000TA524A|5|Fine socks, no complaints. Merino Wool Hiking Crew Socks are just as good, at least on immediate purchase, and a much better deal. Can't say yet what will happen over repeated wear.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009CCRK8C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28
B001JI3RC0|2|Only lames wear these now.. . . . . . ... . . . . . . . . .
B00I5KVCEK|4|Soft and comfy. The elastic waist is a little itchy. Wakes me up at night if I don't remember to fold the waistband over.
B00CLZ14VG|5|Realistic look made a lot of men at the indoor waterpark quite confused. It was easy to confuse for my real body. The t-shirt was soft & roomy which I appreciated because it didn't restrict any of my dancing moves. The colors were bright & eye catching which was helpful in attracting the best looking men. The cover up really embodied the island vibe that I was shooting for.
B003IFUTDM|4|I'm 5'4 105lbs with skinny chicken legs. These socks are very long; they come up approximately 11 inches above my knee (almost up my whole leg), but I am able to roll them down to different lengths. These socks are very warm too. The cotton is thick and doesn't feel cheap. Ran around the house to see if they rolled down..and they didn't! I'm happy with my purchase.
B000WN0HW6|5|These gloves are great. The quality is good and they are nice and warm. I measured my hand and accidently ordered the wrong size. The company turns out to be located in NYC where I live. I called them and they let me come by and exchange the gloves for a smaller size in person. They were very nice and made it very easy.
B00MQAV43O|1|Wallet was too small and was not as large as pictured.  Item was returned.
B00PK3BZTC|5|I love this shirt.  It washes beautifully and the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.  If in between sizes, buy one size down.
B00FBD2G1W|2|These aren't really no show socks. They go up to about below your ankle bone but when you are wearing shoes you can still see them.
B005NJCEF2|5|Fits too size and looks exactly like the picture shown :), and is also of a very good quality. I love it !!!
B00HLVBZQO|5|LOVE THIS SHIRT!
B00FZR1I7C|5|LOVE THE FIT!
B0018P1DKM|5|If you have bigger athletic thighs but not such a big waist, these should do the trick; otherwise, they might be a bit baggy.
B003MAJJDY|3|I have worn 505's for years.  I bought these online because the information provided said 2% Spandex, which I like much better than Elastane because of the fit.  The pair I received had 1% Elastane [!] I tried them on and they seemed loose but I thought since I'd worn 8s before I thought they would shrink.  Washed them in HOT water and dried HOT.  They are still baggy.  My mistake.  So, because 8 Reg was not available here and I'd already washed them, I bought a pair of Sz 6 Reg elsewhere.  Perfect fit.  Actually, I love these jeans but still I do not like the Elastane.<br /><br />I also bought same style 505 Black Ink with Checkmate, 8 Medium and while they are larger, especially in the stomach area, they are not as big so I kept them.  I have athletic legs and I don't think I could wear a Sz 6 in this jean.  The fabric is a lighter weight black cotton/poly w/1% Elastane.<br /><br />I am 66 years old, athletic and trim.  I do not have a belly.  It is disturbing to me that Levi's have gone to adding room in the belly area and to using Elastane.  Why did they abandon the Spandex which helps with a baggy fit???
B00MZQD7UC|3|I purchased this item and when I got it, I tried it on and it is very snug. Will probably gift it to my sister who is smaller than I am. Make sure if you want this shirt a little loose to order a size up.
B004VLTBRC|4|The only fault in MY particular case is the tightness of the top of the socks. It is meant to keep socks up but it stops my circulation. The same brand but without the design fits a lot better.
B003E89038|3|Product okay but had to alter it. It would not fit my 33 inch waist. Also some of the stitching came undone while wearing it for the day.
B00DI8YYWQ|3|Hat fit thanks but the quality is a little cheesy but your get for what you pay for I guess
B008YJN6GE|4|Beautifully made.  Great to hand down to generations that follow.
B00AZGHMYG|3|The dress fit well and was fun to wear but some of the beads fell off and there is no reasonable way to clean it so that it can be worn again.  They only recommend sponge cleaning the dress.
B00BPXGERE|1|This shirt was a XXL for the Big and Tall man and was not advertised as such. The fit was off and my husband was very unsatisfied. I did not check the size of the shirt before I wrapped it and threw away the packaging for fear that he would see his gift before Christmas. Needless to say, very unsatisfied.
B0048LMJ9M|1|The polyaster is the worse material ever been made.- like walking in garbage bag..<br />After complaining to replace to the cotton as ordered , they resent another ,.: polyaster pants
B00ECUF9E6|2|its still small
B009DKNLKO|3|They're pretty tight-fitting. I do like that they are extra long to go past the height of my Muck boots though.
B00XXF2CBY|5|Really cute, gorgeous color, fits well, really nice fluid fabric.  Made well.  Was delivered in a box, on a hanger, and wrapped in plastic.
B00FPEPJFC|5|This is a great scarf! It is nice and large. It is also very soft. I purchased it for my sister as a gift. We both collect scarves. Also, she LOVES owls. We live in the PNW where layering your clothing is a way of life. There is that saying: \\"If you don't like the weather, just wait 10 minutes.\\" It is very true where we live. She will absolutely love this. I love it and I am going to buy one for myself. I highly recommend. I received my scarf in approximately 2 weeks or so, maybe less. Well worth the wait!
B0084TBAE4|3|I have gotten a lot of shirts from this company - and they wear very well.  Not sure about this latest shirt i received, it seems like the material is very light.  Will find out after the holidays...
B00N1V611C|4|Very nice workmanship. From the reviews we thought it would fit small but when we ordered the medium it was too large for a size 2 person so we are going to order the small. Looks great though.
B007JFEROE|5|Good
B00LO8F0NO|5|You'll want  to order your size. But I'm happy  fabric  is well made
B00KKPENPI|5|Beautiful for a wonderful day. The fit was great my grandson was comfortable  and handson.
B00M02I620|5|I didn't expect much for the price, but they are great!
B00IJO4FO6|5|Fits great, good quality
B00K59KWPY|5|This things is exactly as expected! I absolutely love it!
B007C2PWZC|1|Way too small, it say 18 months, but more like fits a 4 month old. I didn't even get to use these for my baby.
B00NH74KN6|5|Nice large size scarf, works as a wrap/shawl too.
B00G9GDWMC|1|junk<br />i would never buy this again<br />too big and it was an xs, and it was bulky when i wore clothes
B009CCRL6I|4|They fit well and keep your feet warm with a good price for this quality.
B00E1LALT4|1|I ordered a black one in M, and it's basically XXS in terms of length. It's like a bandeau with sleeves -- except at least a bandeau is made of stretchy material that helps it stay in place. The material is a nice smooth cotton -- which means that it rides up WAAAAYYYY too high the MOMENT I move my arms in any upwards motion. Unless this is specifically what you want, I do not recommend. (I'm 5' 5&#34;, 120~ pounds if that helps)
B00BOU8QAQ|5|Got this to wear for a formal occasion. I loved it because it was unique and very charming for a young boy. He will also wear this on his birthday just with jeans and a t-shirt! fast shipping and great quality.
B00NBO1G7S|3|I usually wear size 16 to 18 so I ordered a 1X but when it came, it was extremely tight and actually fits my daughter who usually wears a 6 or S.
B00IFS6DQO|4|Mom got it back from my daughter now she is a fan of this dress, looks like you have another customer who loves your dresses.
B00ISVARCE|1|I ordered the Lt Brown which appears to be a medium sand color - It's NOT.<br />It's a much darker brown that looks nothing like the picture.<br />Go see the jackets in person locally before you decide on a color.<br />Amazon's pictures are not accurate.
B00A9ME75S|5|I'm always a little leery about purchasing t-shirts online, especially novelty ones, since so often they are cheaply made and the material can be very thin. I wanted this shirt for a Halloween party, so I took a chance, and I was very pleased with it. It is well-made, and the material is soft and a nice thickness. I will purchase from Impact again.
B00DYQGYH0|5|Live in southern humid region.  Tired of wearing boxers (which I have worn &#62;20 years) which ride up my legs, bunch up under my pants, and Ieave me sweaty underneath  Have also worn boxer briefs (cotton and polyester work out style).  These David Archy trunks are awesome.  I initially followed the size recommendation (my waist is 32) and got size small and these were TOO SMALL.  Then ordered my usual medium size and they fit well - you need to ignore the sizing chart and get your usual size.  They are short, almost like a brief, but therefore don't ride up my legs or bunch up under pants.  The supima cotton/spandex mix is SUPER COMFY.  The 'anatomical pouch' provides good support and is not too constrictive (for someone who is used to boxers).  I have had these for about a month and have since replaced all my old boxers/etc with these.  Will never buy a different pair of underwear.  To top it off my wife likes how they look on me (even without having a model's body)!
B00OIKLYRQ|5|Absolutely beautiful gloves. I used them for a cosplay costume and they stayed up perfectly on my arms. I didn't have the problem like with other gloves where the fingers were too long or they slipped down all night, these held up very well through a night of dancing and hand holding. Perfect for a formal or costume wear.
B004LUL4B4|4|Cool shirt.  Fits as expected.  Shipment arrived in the stated time period.
B004OZ2F8M|3|The T Shirt is very nice, nice cloth and feel, nice design and print - however the size is an issue - I normally wear medium size which i ordered here. It turned out skinny tight so i returned it and ordered large. Even the large is very tight. the length is tight but te fit is too skinny....
B0002UE3OM|3|I looked all over the internet for a support belt - I read that having one after major abdominal surgery (c-section) was helpful. . . When I asked one of the nurses before I went in, she discouraged me from purchasing one, because she said that I might get dependent on it. I would rely on the belt instead of working on strengthening my stomach muscles (this is a lady that has had 3 c-sections herself).      So I had my c-section, was in the hospital for 4 days after, and thought, \\"this isn't so bad! I don't need the belt,\\" but then I came home and the pain medications started to wear off. My stomach was still pouchy in the front, and just by trying to walk upright, my back hurt. . . SOOO. . .   I bought the belt.      It helps if you do not rely on it. I used it for back support, and lower stomach support. This isn't comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. . . and when I first put it on, it was snug - after pregnancy, you're still \\"pregnant\\"!     PROS:   - Back support for after c-section or major abdominal surgery   - Holds waistline in   - Semi-invisible under clothing   - Made entirely of stretchy elastic   - Could stretch the velcro all the way over and fasten     CONS:    - Rolls down/shifts during wear   - Not super comfortable   - The length is a little too short - it would probably fit better if it was contoured or longer in height   - Not enough support after vaginal delivery     I don't think I would recommend this item - not comfortable enough, or practical enough. Keep in mind that this product probably doesn't have enough support if you're looking for a \\"corset\\" style support belt.
B00MHA7H4I|2|The top is cute but the bottoms are made small, however, we made it work, but I think the top looks better with different bottoms.
B0060JJVF0|1|Would not buy again.  First there is no liner and material is very thin, so you need to wear compression shorts underneath.  Second the draw string is too short.  There are better products out there for a similar price.
B003KG9ZG6|3|For some reason I did not realize that this was mint green & brown, My daughter says her daughter will look like a mint chip ice cream cone. Since the baby is not here until December we will have to wait & see. I think the material is fine & the outfit is very cute,
B00RB6XZ4O|5|Great quality. I did remove the pom pom..very easy to do...since it pushed against the back of the seat in the car.
B00265KF7U|5|Fit my daughter perfectly super cute for an infant and if you live in colder climates it's perfect cause it really bundles them up! Just put a onesie on underneath
B00DOIKVG8|5|purchased as gifts for my nieces who prefer high end products, this does not pass off as super expensive but it mimics the look of the higher end scarf and both stylish nieces loved it
B001AEUN48|1|This product does not deserve even one star, the hat was crushed and misshaped. This is by far the worst result of an Amazon order I have ever received. I wish to return this hat as soon as possible.
B005KSZHHI|5|very good
B00PGJ7TYK|2|I got a 2x which is what I normally wear and it didn't even come close to closing. Going to try a bigger size but I'm not sure if the design will work even with a larger size
B00FFGUCJS|3|just o.k.
B0053BSWD8|5|Product was as advertised and was a great fit.  Would recommend this to anyone that wants a great training outfit.
B00GD3VADY|5|Not only did I love the shirt , so did my Grandson Brantley,he also loved the Dusty the air plane, an 2 books about air planes he was ready to read them as soon as they came to his house , he is 3 years old so his parents read them with him. I love the fact I can send them to his address .Thank you , he said he is going to be a pilot some day.
B00PBCKD4A|5|Great shirt in every way!!
B007QB57AY|5|Excellent fitting!
B00DKSVPRG|4|I expected this item to be a little small compared to other items I usually get only because I haven't gotten anything slim-fit in years. I had recently lost a lot of weight and decided to try it out. When I followed the seller's offered size chart/guide I specifically ordered one that would be 2 sizes larger than the other clothes I buy and it was still about half a size smaller than I expected it to be. Not a bad product really, just difficult to get the proper size based on the information given I suppose.
B007MIBB7E|2|fit very well and is in great condition. my only problem with this was it was a blue tint instead of the charcoal grey
B00C2D5YJ0|4|Don't trust the color you see. It's actually a darker blue than the lighter blue shown in the pic, hence 4 stars bcoz I bought this thinking that I was replacing my husbands light blue KC shirt that's worn out.Great shirt otherwise . Prefer these to other brands. Wish there were more color options
B00MLND4KC|1|plain as hell
B00DQ1V1L2|5|Very beautiful. Great fabric, very good for winter. Exceeded my expectations.<br />I indicated to known and con certainly will acquire other pieces.
B00LEBTPSC|1|Crappy material, holes form out of nowhere
B003FQ4SIQ|4|If you have a gut ....it will help only  hide a little....it makes your chest look respectful, but it mentally makes you want to lose weight.
B007WPNNNM|5|kind of pricey
B00R2E2A8W|5|fit was perfect, fabric was beyond comfortable and the color was gorgeous! Couldn't be happier!
B00831VYC6|4|I took this thing on a three week trip. It works just as described.  I previously bought a different brand and found it way too small, especially if you wanted to pack more than one bra. This one can fit probably 3-4 bras worry free. For me, it is a little big for travel (I bought the C/D) so it takes up more space than I'd like. As the description says, you can put other things like hair accessories and socks to make use of the extra space. On my trip, the thing got a little smashed in transit, but the bras were fine and the case popped right back to its original form.
B00IUUD9IC|3|This top is a vibrant yellow color, but the fit is on the small size.
B00OKUNZW6|3|The black printing on the edge doesn't look as nice as in the photo
B00KLXZIJ4|4|I really love these pants but they run small my daughter is barly a size 5 and they are very snug
B001FCZZK2|5|Love, Love, Love these jeans!  It is very difficult to find a great pair of jeans and these are the ones for me.  Normally jeans are too tight in the waist and loose in the thighs but these were perfect.  The wide leg is perfect as well.  They are not too wide and the jeans are so lightweight that I could sleep in them!  I absolutely love them.  I was going to buy another pair but they no longer have my size.  Cost is not an object when jeans fit this good.
B00CLVQ9O2|4|Like It
B00UJ3UY0Y|4|A bit too small for my foot (I wear a size 11.5 in men's) but they're still great. I don't flaunt them around because they are &#34;girly&#34; looking but I much rather wear them than get blisters on my heel or toes.<br /><br />Recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to wear socks with their shoes.
B0031U0P8I|2|Really disappointed in the quality of this belt.  It's stamped out of a single piece of leather, but that's the end of the leather work. No bevels on the edges, and a poor, rough finish on the underside.  The cheap, rubbery coating is already flaking off after less than a month.  I've own a couple of articles of actual bridle leather, and they've lasted an incredibly long time. This belt, I suspect, will be lucky to make it a year or two before it goes into the garbage. Better to pay a little more for a quality belt that will last a while than to pay a bit less for this junk. I'm honestly surprised that Carhartt would put its name on this belt. It's that bad.
B009KOCJCO|5|I love this top. The material is soft and slightly stretchy. I have ease of movement and it is a joy to work in.
B00HZO05XQ|5|Hot love them on my wife.
B00B7GL3NO|3|I ordered two different brands.  These, although the same size, were much larger (longer) than the other brand (Calvin Klein).  The cotton fabric is also not the same quality.  When my husband held them together to compare, this brand was at least 3 inches longer.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them so I will donate them to a thrift store or homeless shelter.
B00GU5MH50|3|I ordered as recommended and jacket still fit small.
B0077KKEBG|5|High quality. REally nice looking wallet for an awesome price.
B00IZQQJWE|1|not what i thought, no sequins.
B00HUOO1OU|5|for the price this jacket is amazing. the buttons poped off in first wear but thats an easy fix and the fact that the black comes off at the bottom is so awesome.
B00LMTMUMO|3|They do not fit the best for me around my waist.  They are a little loose in the back, but work fine if I wear a belt.
B00D3YQJA0|2|Overall not impressed. Got mine 2 sizes larger than I would normally get and it just fits, not loose at all. The construction is cheap, if you put your hands in the pockets they hang out the bottom of the jacket (not stitched in at the bottom seam like you would see in a well made jacket), and the chest pocket is just for looks (not a real pocket). My jacket even has a hole in the pocket where they missed sewing it together! Cheaply done as I said. The overall look of the jacket is not bad, could have made it more asymmetrical, it's zipper is just slightly off center, not really to the side. I hate returning things, but I might return this, it already has a hole and it's brand new, so who knows if this thing will even hold together.
B00O01VJNC|5|Nice wool dress that can work over leggings, with a wide belt, or as even a Lolita school girl look.
B00BQBB010|5|love
B00CC6ZVJK|5|They ears on the hood are so cute, they make the outfit. The size is true to size! I recommend.
B00Q52WT8S|4|Feel good and keep me cool.
B00WGG186Q|3|So I was careful ordering this because of reading the chart sizes. I'm just shy of 5'3\\" and only weigh 115 lbs so I'm not a big girl by any means looking at the inches on the chart put me in a xxl I only wear a 2x when I shop in the kid department! When I got it, it didn't fit well and the stetches were far from straight (top only bottoms were perfect). The top was also to loose and to short for my torso and the straps were to tight on the neck but bunched up the fabric in the back. I contacted the seller about the problem and did get part of my money back. After a few alterations it looks wonderful but I had to let out the bottom seam and uncross the straps.
B00I1D5ZXA|5|I purchased these for my nephew.  His mother swears by the fit.  She says they are the only socks that Sully keeps on!!  Great patterns too!!
B004VPBY00|4|Stylish, sexy, very tight fit, order two sizes bigger than normal
B00J65EWA4|5|Very cool shirt wish they made these in Plus Sizes
B00378WO56|5|Good quality and fit.
B00JXH7L9Y|4|It's a good petticoat for the price. I refuse to pay more than this for something that goes under my skirt. So I was happy. Very stiff! But I am sure it will get better the more I wear.
B000H6DKNG|5|VERY COMFORTABLE,SOFT & FIT GREAT
B000TJNBG2|4|A little small for the size and the rise is not as high as I like. Good construction with double layer pockets with old school pocket depth. Good summer weight fabric
B00CMAT778|5|I only own 2(x)ist.  Though this is listed as the &#34;No Show&#34; style, they feel much more like the &#34;Contour Pouch&#34; style to me.  Very comfortable fit.
B00IY5GUMU|4|A handy and compact little holder.  Plus, I am a romantic for anything NYC.
B00LIPAZHY|4|It is very soft and fluffy, but a lot of lint fall of it.
B00JPX97ES|4|Uoften Women's Sexy Peplum shirt is very beautiful. The only think I wish the back also had lace..
