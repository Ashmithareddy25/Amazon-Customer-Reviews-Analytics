B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I'm a fan of mark & he's cop movies - but this one you can skip n wait till HBO play it for free b'cuz you'll be mad at paying for this move rental .
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I like the game, and it is pretty true to the physics. It is fun, and I do empathize with the little robot, Roby a little bit. However, it doesn't come with a tutorial or anything, so it's all learning by trial and error.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|The plot - The drug lord decides to escape and drive to Mexico ?  Hum ! Does anyone sees this plot is stupid !?  This was a political movie about borders and its excuse to close them . Cuz bad man may escape via highway!? Drug lords don't need highways to escape - if u that rich . U can pay top Lawyers & judges to do it for you . U don't need extra stuff fancy cars nor a military bridge to go to escape to Mexico . This is an insult to all Mexican drug lords lol
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This was great!  There were several things I did not know about Bob.  Give it a try and jam your night away.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|What can I say Tarentino leaves me speechless . Sam was so funny a head - hum Servant - I don't want to end up like Puala Dean with no job lol
B00D3V85FA|5.0|A great Sabbath album for any true fan.<br />Reminiscence of several of the previous albums.<br />An album that grows on you.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|If you're looking for a moral and great movie to see with you're family this one is it. Once again a  successful movie just like the other movie &#34;millionaire&#34;
0307346617|3.0|Wasn't as good as I thought it would be, not terrible. Maybe I just had a unreasonable high hopes for it
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If you looking for a good bad guy that safes the day & the lady . This one is it . He plays an intelligent  ...nah you have to see it . :-)
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Makes me happy every time I listen to it! It's truly magical. Makes you feel like you're in a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|After all the years it has been in existence, I just got my first smart phone last november. I'm not too bad at this, but trying to figure out how to play, and what I can use is a task. I had to read on Amazon site to find that birds can be tapped to have powers. Instructions would be nice, but the game is fun. It is on my Android phone and my Kindle Fire.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Enjoyed most of the songs.  Like that Josh's CDs have new music. Glad there are still some easy listening artists.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is the kind of book that can make you feel like it's a friend. So many of the situations relate to many of our own moments of embarrassment and laughable times. Great read, really!
B0098460O4|5.0|Heard about this couple via YouTube from a friend. What  wonderful voices. My 9 month grandson even loves listening to them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun game to pass time. it is challenging but not difficult game to play with friends. I wish it had more levels but they said more to come I just cant wait but for your ipad it doesn't have all 10 levels it only has 8 o well!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hours of endless fun.<br />The tutorial needs to be a little more defined on how to find the items to unlock the room.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is very soothing and helps me fall asleep.  It is the perfect app to use to fall asleep to because it has a timer that will shut down the app.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|the greatest sfi show all time<br />they made history with only 11 chapters and is remain today in the top
B00AHFOP4A|5.0|WE loved it watched it twice it was so good. Halle Berry was just great and Bruce Willis was so funny
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I thought this movie was just fabulous!  All the actors certainly delivered.  The plot was unpredictable; the movie captivating.  Enjoy!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Beautifully written. Well acted.  If you are tired of movies filled with shoot'em ups, car chases, and random sex, and are looking for a movie to entertain you through its fun characters and story line, watch this delight.
B000ICZD4I|4.0|Like some moves based on books, sometimes you have to read the book first to understand the movie.  This is one of them.  There is a lot of background information on the characters in the book that definitely add to the knowledge of the movie; and in some instances, the movie does not follow the book.  Anyway, the acting is very good and Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates are absolutely wonderful.  I highly recommend this movie to those who like &#34;Southern Women Flicks.&#34;
0345529057|5.0|This book set is paperback, but the paper is strong and I love that they come in a set with a collectors box to keep the safe and on display. I bought these for my husband as a father's day gift and they came quick! Stoked to have these on display on our bookshelves! Great quality product and will most definitely be buying from this seller again! Thanks for the books!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have waited for years to be able to play this franchise. i got rid of my DS just before this game came out. and when unlimited came out my laptop couldn't play it. so i am so happy to finally be able to play this game. it's very fun and a steal at $2 (i recommend getting the world pass).
B0098460O4|5.0|This CD is such a treat.  I have listened to it over and over and enjoyed it just as much each time.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanya is a artist. his creativeness is elevating threw this album. Surprise not to hear anybody from his click, I guess this one was personal
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Security caught this as potential virus and would not let it through.  I uninstalled so not sure it works.  Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's challenging, fun and addictive. The only bad thing is that they need to add more levels!
B00CDPP9X8|4.0|Three stars<br />In this case the I enjoyed the movie more than the book<br />Looking forward to my next book on my Kindle.<br />How can I skip this Review process?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so realistic.  I love horses so I think this is the perfect game and its perfect
B001QB5SFO|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed this movie and love singing along to all the songs!!!! The item was in excellent condition and played perfectly in our player.
B00004RJ71|1.0|Basically a vapid, pretentious pseudo analysis of Hispanic culture in Los Angeles.  The movie exaggerates Hispanic cultural achievements while endorsing Mexican racism, including the foaming brown supremacist propaganda of \\"La Raza\\" (the race) colonizing America.  Cheesy acting and writing seal the deal.  If you doubt the film's racist intent and following, check the YouTube page for it.  Nothing but bigoted, anti-white, pro-Mexican comments.<br /><br />Leftist/PC themes:<br />* Leukophobic stereotyping of the main character's white father<br />* Endorsement of the Mexican supremacist colonization agenda<br />* Constant racist verbal attacks of the \\"half-white\\" character<br />* Pervasive anti-white sentiment
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Cool graphics and really good gyro controls on the Kindle Fire HD.  Fast paced action is a lot of fun.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Love this movie! Can watch it over and over. You can't go wrong for some good clean fun with this one. Enjoy!
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|my grandkids love this ...even the 8 year old plays it along with the 2 year old. I'm getting tired of the &#34;my turn&#34; from the kids....they can't get enough of it.
6305428425|5.0|If you want a good laugh then this is the flick for you. These two ditsy blondes give new meaning to &#34;I'm so sure&#34;. You will love this one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoy his writing  and plot development. I learn a lot from his writing.  Look forward to his next novel
B009JZWO3I|3.0|This is starting to get a bit dull.  You can carry the concept only so far.  The first 2 seasons were the peak of this series.
B00973DDN2|3.0|It's like they took all the worst parts of Hot Fuss and made a demented, self-absorbed love child with Sam's Town. To be fair, I really liked their electro-pop deal and have been a waning fan since they got moustache-y. But hey. That's just me.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This game is addictive and fun. It is also working your brain, using your analytical skills. I great way to pass a rainy afternoon or a few minutes waiting in line. Great game
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|A good number of the songs have a good riff here and there, but they are not built on, giving me a feeling of meandering, lack of direction.  Thus this album suffers from weak production.  I read in Iommi's book that Rick Rubin has a hands off producing style.  Well it certainly shows!  Based on the results they could have used stronger direction. The songs all show potential, but then it is not realized.  This is a recording that may grow on me and maybe add a 1/2 star at best.<br /><br />Just listen to the music Iommi and Butler made only recently (2009) on \\"The Devil You Know\\" (Dio, Iommi, & Butler produced) and the extra cuts on \\"The Dio Years\\" (Martin Birch, Mack, Iommi, Butler, and Dio produced).  THEY KICK ASS!<br /><br />What happened in the four intervening years?
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This was just a totally strange book and I did not enjoy it at all.  Characters were not likeable at all and I did finish the book but felt like I had wasted my time.  I am sorry I finished reading it..........should have put it aside.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|A nice deviation from Pearl Jam (of which I am a fan). I really like this cd. It's relaxing and unique. I suspect uke sales will increase as a result of this cd!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Directions to play not good. How the heck r uou supposed to know which order to click items....hints would  be hrlpful.Will be deleting the gamer soon unless my grand kids like it
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is great. I love all the flow games and this one is by far my favorite! It is so fun!!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Have had the Kindle Fire for  3 days  and  am loving it.  Taking time to get use to it but it is great and fills  a  need for me
B0054SMID0|5.0|I don't understand why I never heard of it before. It had enough twists and turns in it to keep you interested in the outcome.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Love this movie & seeing it on Blu-Ray is AMAZING! Well worth the money. It's nice to get the bonus discs as well.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I started watching this show on a recommendation and believe me, I'm hard to satisy, but I was pleasantly surprised. The lead actress is very talented and there's enough plot twists to keep you engaged and wanting more.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and can't get enough of it.  I like that I can play bingo and slots all in one game.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|An entertaining and engaging book about how we all have a Personal Legend to fulfill. Perhaps unintentionally, hethe author challenges me to do the same.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am 76 years old and need to stimulate my brain. This puzzle is a great way to do that.
031603438X|5.0|Over 500 pages and well worth the purchase! Really gets you into the insight of the man. Keith has led a remarkable life and talks openly about all the good as well as bad times. Respect him so much more now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game had me up until 2 in the morning! I was glued to it. The game is challenging and is interesting and fun at the same time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is super fun!!!!!!! U get to breed dragons and feed them and get money from the dragons to decorate your  Island's.Try the moon Dragon it makes a lot of money and fast. The diamond Dragon's each give u 1 diamond a week. So that's 4 diamonds  a week!!!! If u save enough diamonds about 2,000 Diamonds u get the sun Dragon. U can also use diamonds to speed up your habitats because the habitats are under construction when u first buy it. U can get habitat boosts to boost whatever dragons u have. U can buy food farms to feed the dragons. There is a coloseum where u can do Dragon events like the Olympics. Both the sun and the moon dragon's give lots of money so u can buy a lot of dragons and habitats and all of the things I just told u about HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005XN31LY|4.0|My daughter had seen it and wanted us to watch it together. I enjoyed it more as the season went on.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The content is well-structured and easy to follow. The technical stuff is explained in plain language. Very comprehensive and useful.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game game, but lots of adds. For some reason I can't win at the random deal, but only win if I play a winning deal.But hey its free & fun
B0058YPL66|5.0|If you like fairy tales this show will put a twist on them and link them all together some how, very addicting.  The season came in a perfect brand new condition at a wonderful price.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|ANOTHER BORING MOVIE - AS USUAL JUST BECAOUSE THE ACADEMY PROCLAIMS IT A SUCCESS IT DOES NOT MEAN  IT IS  - WE SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE \\"CLUB\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is great! Everyone always told me to read it and it is just great, something new in every chapter!
044024613X|2.0|I did not love this book. Good premise, but felt sort of \\"been there, done that\\" to me. No real twists and I found myself caring less and less what happened as the book went on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is just so much fun, love playing it on my phone as well as tablet, just a great game!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really fast reading. Very spicy. Woman would enjoy this book. Makes you want to find out how the story will end.
B0086700CM|2.0|The graphics on this game is just very poor. I think that it would be best for little kids so they can do something to just play around with but it is not for the true gamer.
0061124265|5.0|From the first page, the author kept me interested what might happen to Veronika.  Because I didn't cheat, the ending was a surprise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!<br />I play it everyday!<br />Mostly on my phone, my tablet is just to big.
B002361MLA|5.0|First read the paperback years ago. Tolle lives in the present moment and is a fine teacher for living in the Now. Downloaded the Kindle version so I could have it to refer and serve as a reminder.<br />I would recommend it to anyone on their path to spirituality.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is great! Everyone always told me to read it and it is just great, something new in every chapter!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I like J Ir(?), but this movie and its story line were a bit strange - even for witchcraft.  This was one of the movies that kept re-booting and I was getting bored.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love YouVersion Bible app! Very user friendly. The devotional studies are my favorite. It would be really helpful if the app somehow noted or highlighted your completed studies when you are browsing plans. That would make it a 5+ star app for me.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|As a child of the 50s this tale was a staple like Star Wars to the next generation and so on.  To see this modern adaptaion was both satisfying and grisley.  So I dont think I could have taken it well as a 5 year old.
B00B8PQC5S|2.0|Some segments pop some just thud to the ground. If you like short films give it a shot. If not then there's other things to do with your time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is so awesome that when I was grounded. it was because I was on ice age so much.I can not get off of it iamb on it late and early. I just love it
B007HACDLK|5.0|Wonderful plot, great characters, devious twists, political intrigue, treason blood and brains, courage: all elements that create a memorable book. I read it twice and recommended it highly. It is, perhaps, the most accomplished book in the series.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|I had no problem reading the kindle edition, this is a very funny book, with a lot of memorable moments and a twist of sci-fi.
B000XUBC5E|2.0|The Ghost suddenly turns from a bully and a sadist into an empathic character and a concerned, sympathetic guy.  Sorry, that was a total downer.  Too many twists and turns of plot to the point it gets psychologically illogical.<br /><br />jk
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|At first I had troubles to buy this book online, it was not avaliable to sell to my adress in Mexico. A lot of 80's and nostalgia inside this book, and some very cool ideas.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love this series... I am so disappointed that it was cancelled...but truthfully, to have each full season on DVD is the best way to watch this series... it does challenge the viewer intellectually.... it's like the X-Files on STEROIDS!!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I really enjoy the whole show. The family element reminds me of the Sopranos. It can be violent at times.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Great to see Bruce Willis back on screen. Loaded with action. Quick moving and doesn't drag out too long. Recommend!
B00099BPP6|5.0|this rigoleto will be the best if it wasn't that i like more merrill than fisher-dieskau as rigoletto & i like more sutherland than scotto as gilda & i like more pavarotti than bergonzi as ducca, & rudel's direction i preffer to kubelik's, but theres no better maddalena than cossotto & the recording is very well balanced, dieskau makes a great rigoletto with his creamy voice, scotto's vocal instrument is amazing & bergonzi is verdi's heroic tenor by excelence. in general i just think is only second to sutherland/pavarotti/bonynge's version, iit lacks the tour de force that bonynge's has, allthought is really very good. if you like to have several versions of the same opera as i do bcos i think every cast makes a whole different performance of the same work & as long as is a good one, i wanna hear them all. this is my 4th rigoletto, after sutherland/pavaroti's, moffo/kraus's & sills/kraus's. now im affraid about the gruberova/shicoff one that i wanna get next, bcos sinoppoli's direction, i readed is very dry & i wonder why since his nabucco & macbeth are so good
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This was a complete waste of my time! I just don't get the point to any of this violence. I have nothing against violent movies when the violence is coherent within a story and a context. Here you just have a completely incoherent story with a bunch of hideous killings sprinkled in to get your attention. I'm glad I didn't go to a theater 'cause I would have probably walked out. A very poor attempt for a cute boy to play tough. Tough is many things but it isn't this!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I don't think mainstream TV get any better than this. Always meticulous, always surprising, filled with rich beautifully acted charcters.
B0091REZMW|4.0|For the most part this is just what I expected from a mystery hidden object game. Everything seems a bit small of a tablet. I would not be able to play this on a phone for sure.
B001V7SME2|5.0|This is a story of love between a human and a vampire, but one with an ending you will never see coming.  The vampire, who appears as a 12 year-old girl, asks her young friend to understand her--he wants to kill the kids who bully him because he wants revenge.  But she must kill in order to live.  Does he understand her?  Wait 'til the end and see!<br /><br />And who is that strange man who lives with the vampire and hunts for her?  He is human (he eats real food, not blood), and so he ages as a human.  When did he meet her?  Perhaps when he too was 12?<br /><br />Don't see this movie because you like vampire pics.  See it because you want to know something about love.
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|Good cast, good movie, good effects. Did it knock my socks off.... No, but I will watch again.  My little one caught a minute of it and wondered \\"why are those trolls chasing the boy?\\"  The effects are very reminiscent of other films.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Liked the narrative .  Kept me interested in the outcome for a good way through the book.  Loved the way it switched from the 40's to the 60's to present day.  Worth a read.
1594204217|5.0|You know sometimes when you really enjoy a book and search out works by the same author thinking they must be equally wonderful, only to be bitterly disappointed by that next book? This wasn't one of those times. I thoroughly enjoyed Cooked, and it more than lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Each part of Cooked looks in depth at a few cooking or preparation methods. Fire is mostly about something called whole hog barbecue (emphatically not the same kind of BBQ we do in Australia), Water is the story of braises and the like that are generally cooked slowly in liquid, Air concentrates on the wonders of sourdough baking, and Earth on ferments like sauerkraut and its relations, cheeses and alcohols. Yes, the basic recipes are included.<br /><br />As I am quite a fan of slow cooking, particularly when it comes to making use of the already slow cooked stocks and broths I have made, have been making sourdough in preference to buying bread for the family for the last 18 months, and am quite taken by the idea of fermented vegetables, adore cheeses, and quite like alcohol (even though I have not ventured further than kombucha in my own kitchen), I was almost bound to love Cooked.<br /><br />It's not just the content of the book that I love though. I like Pollan's style. To me he seems to be able to express his passion for his subject, as well as convey the facts, and produce a humorous book, and to do it all quite gently. Some authors seem to be almost beating you over the head with their message and their enthusiasm, Pollan manages to avoid that.<br /><br />Cooked is a large book, my hard back copy finishes at page 468. I had a minor panic when I realised that I had 5 days to read it or I would need to re-join the library request queue. But I have finished it with more than 24 hours to spare. It is an easy book to sit down with in the sun with a cup of tea and just get lost in. This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time.<br /><br />http://healthierjane.com
B007ZXK08C|4.0|found the characters quite engaging.  loved the fact the whole story was told from both angles. great twist near the end!!  would recommend as  a good holiday read.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Wasn't expecting much, but was very entertaining and lots of good scenes and action. Would recommend it to everyone including kids.
B0032SQCQI|1.0|This movie was not even a little bit good.  None of it makes any sense.  The storyline is all over the place and there is not a solid plot to ground it all together.  I like sci fi to a point, but when it looks like a third grader wrote a play that turned into a movie (I say a third grader because little kids don't follow any rules when writing stories) then, I'm out.  Everything is made up and there just isn't any reasonable explanation for what is happening or why.  Even real serial killers have a basis for what they do.  They have a reason that makes sense to them and to us even if we don't agree with their reason.  Also, the things that go on are not feasible even in the most realistic sci fi movie.  It's just one of the dumbest movies I have ever been duped to purchase.
B00729V7NG|5.0|I would like to start off by saying Soulfly has evolved into something much more than what I have ever expected it to be. This band change up is one of the best in the Soulfly catalogue. Every song remains heavy except for Soulfly 8 which I also loved. Even the Soulfly instrumentals have gotten better. IMO this is the best Soulfly album. I highly recommended it. Keep up the good work Max!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love TED.  Each weekday, they post a new speech from someone who will inspires you or challenges you to think differently.  Each speaker is unique - sometimes they are discussing an achievement in technology or design; maybe they are sharing an experience they had; perhaps they are advocating for a certain group of people.  Some talks are funny, while others are more serious.  If you're into creativity and learning new things then TED Talks are for you - many of the speakers are on the cutting edge of their fields, whether it be science, technology, or art.<br /><br />I try to never miss a TED Talk.  I have TED bookmarked on my laptop, and I have the app for both my Kindle Fire and my iPhone.  If I get the opportunity in the future, I'd love to go to a TED conference.  But the next best thing is having all the events captured and shared with the world for free on the internet.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Another great book by David Baldacci. Hard to sleep when you can't put the book down. Very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0012FCGN6|4.0|After seeing \\"Man of Steel\\" and liking the music in that film, I decided to revisit the music from previous Superman movies.  I was somewhat familiar with the score for \\"Superman Returns\\" having seen the film, and of course I knew the main Superman theme by John Williams which the film incorporated.  But I had never sat down and listened to the whole soundtrack album.<br /><br />The composer on \\"Superman Returns\\" is John Ottman, a talented guy who not only writes music but is a film editor as well.  Ottman often collaborates with director Brian Singer, and together they modernize Superman while staying true to the earlier films.  The scores pays homage the original John Williams \\"Superman\\" score, but it also diverges in some areas.  The whole album is very pleasant to listen to, it strikes a nice balance of emotion and intensity.<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS:<br />[1] Superman Returns<br />[9] Not Like the Train Set<br />[13] Saving the World<br />[15] Reprise/Fly Away
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Considering that this was over 30 years old (I never saw it until now).<br />I was impressed and very entertained
B006BOT28U|5.0|This is an interesting book that takes you through some thinking processes that can really help you think through many situations in your business and personal life.  It is also a fun read.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|I enjoy how Elizabeth Strout writes; she draws me into her characters and I identify with them.  This novel was full of many emotions and the story was beautiful.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I'm late in watching the show, but now I can catch up quickly. I really like the 1st seasons Dr. Who character.  I know year 2 will be a different guy. The special effects are a bit old but this show is from 2005. I'm sure as the seasons progress the CGI will get better.
B008G33NFC|5.0|Must have for any Tarja fan ! Nightwish doesn't know their loss, Tarja commands the stage as always. Maybe for that reason Nightwish wanted to move on without her.
6304712936|5.0|loved tom hulce (mozart)<br />and also liked:<br />the story his (mozart's) genius and the jealousy of salieri<br />his (mozart) offbeat tacky behavior vs. his classical brilliance<br />the ease of his (mozart's) writings vs. the unease of writing &#34;requiem&#34;<br />a raw observation of humanity<br />well filmed....do like milos forman...a well done flowing visual, dramatic film
B00CBU7JQ0|5.0|Really amazing long,long awaited item!!<br />1.the album is perfect i would put it with their first 5 albums....no doubt!<br />2.the art work is also awsome.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR REAL SABBATH FANS.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book takes you for a ride and never lets go! Cannot wait to read next one! Is it really four am? Time is lost reading this.
B00AEDDSTI|5.0|Engrossing story of paradise gone wrong.  I saw the movie, and then decided to read the book. Slightly different events, but same story- both are good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for all ages it is cool and creative also glad its also free yolk swag yolo swag yolo swag and I'm out
1878424319|5.0|If you are open to \\"The Secret\\" then you may want to read this book. I read this book back in 2009. I find that I must go back to this book every so often. I find that I take things personally every once in a while. The book has an introduction about how we as humans were \\"domesticated\\" as proper human beings.  \\"Don't do that\\" or \\"don't do this\\" is part of our upbringing to teach us how to behave in the world.<br /><br />If you want the meat of the book, skip the introductory part and go to the Four Agreements. Never take Anything Personally, Always do your best, Speak the Truth and the last one..I can't remember. If you want a more in depth look at the philosophy behind it all, read the introduction.<br />This book is much better than the Bible IMHO.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Surprizing, I was alive, paying attention and had no idea this happened.  Beautiful job, thanks for the insider education Ben.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 6 year old son and I love this game.  Not too hard...not too easy...best of all ,it was free.  We can't wait for more levels to come.  Definitely recommend!!!!!!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|a friend recommend ded this film since we loved him in Deadwood and Helen is awesome.<br />Apparently it is a true story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome!<br />I have had this game for a year and now they have upgraded it to have better graphics, more stuff, and you can play with other people on pocket edition
0425264351|5.0|Wow!  Lee Child was introduced to us, by a good friend in London, so I decided to start at the very beginning, and now I'm hooked on this writer!  Steve warned me that I'd not be able to put the book down, once I got past page one, and he sure was right on!  I've now picked up &#34;The Affair&#34; and &#34;Worth Dying For&#34; at our local library and didn't get any housework done all week, as I sat out by the pool, whisking through them.  My husband has nearly finished HIS second mystery novel, and I'm wondering if he too, got totally inspired by Jack Reacher's antics!!!  As we walked down Main St last nite, after dinner out, we noticed in the window of our favorite Used Book Store, sitting right beside Hemingway's &#34;The Sun Also Rises&#34;... Lee Child's &#34;Die Trying&#34; !!  I'll try to get there tomorrow morning, before anyone else scoops it up!  The ironing pile can wait, can't it??
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's an awesome game. Kind of like temple run but your Ironman. Can't wait to unlock more suites. I wish I was better at it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was a little concerned about how they were going to develop the characters. But, surprisingly they were able to pull off a well rounded series of characters with only a few weird spots.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Best light for reading or writing at night when not wanting to turn on house lights. Would be great for emergency lighting also. Glad I found this app.<br />THANK YOU!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Loved having the map but twice I suddenly had no action signs active, which threw me off and it took me awhile to figure out why. Having access to the walkthrough helped. I also appreciated that once something was found in the hidden objects scenes, it was still gone when it was revisited.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app! it is fun but not impossible! I have Benn looking for a good puzzle app and I found a great one!
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|Worth the price I paid for it with a bunch of promotional credits,  but wouldn't have purchased it otherwise.  The singles are awesome, the lyrics are alright, the music is alrighty, but other than the singles, not something worth repeated listening to. Stick with the singles!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is a great app and does not require internet access. If you want<br />a memory I would recommend Calculator Plus. Even if it doesn't do fractions it is still a good app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can You Escape is highly addictive and loads of fun you can literally spend hours solving each puzzle without wanting to stop! I definitely recommend this awesome game! :)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a great match 3 game.  There are a lot of levels and some can be quite challenging.  Very addicting.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|I don't like the amount of time I have to wait to play. That is a stupid thing to put in a game. Make me stop playing for 20 minutes? Hell, I'll stop for good! Plus, the game rejects last minute moves that are made with time left on the clock!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This book is a hilarious read for fans of Star Trek, fans of Star Trek spoofs or anyone who's ever felt like their life revolves around someone else.<br />This is definitely a one gag story, but it's so funny and clever that you don't mind.  A great summer lightweight sci-fi romp.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|Excellent must-read!  I recommend making a habit of reading it again and again over time to absorb and integrate its light and hope into your life and daily existence.
0062255657|5.0|One of those rare books with that nameless quality that makes you never forget it.  A very thoughtful, gripping story that causes you to want to believe the impossible.  Fantasy, but in a good, human, storytelling way.  A story founded on real life and then spiced with fascinating characters, good and bad, that you can see so clearly.  I could not recommend this more highly.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I NEVER NEW HOW MUCH FUN CROSS WORD PULZERS WERE. THIS IS ALOT OF FUN, FOR ANY AGE. PLUS YOU CHOOSE WHAT SIZE PECIES YOU WANT! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IT'S FREE! ENJOY!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was so serious and yet had me laughing out loud so hard! Perfect for a date night, but beware of how long it is!
B002DJSBMA|5.0|From what I gather from reading some of these reviews is that you either get this movie or you don't.  I'm so glad to see that most people who are reviewing it here are getting it.  It is one of my all time favorites.  It is very rare for me to watch a movie more than twice.  Only a handful of movies have been on that special list (e.g There Will be Blood).  I adore Meet Joe Black.  I'm always mesmerized the whole way through to the end.  Here are a couple of reasons why: the actors and acting are superb.  I especially love Claire Forlani's character and how the relationship develops between her and Brad Pitt's character Joe Black.  Matter of fact I was most impressed with her realness and vulnerability in the movie with Pitt's portrayal of Joe Black coming in second.  I can actually see them being together in real life.  As far as Anthony Hopkins is concerned, I love him in just about everything and he works well with Pitt.  Second is that the story is very unique.  I imagine that it must have been hard to act to this story but Pitt did it exceptionally well.  Third was the music, I love the music in this film (T.Newman).  It's so hauntingly beautiful that it still brings tears to my eyes when I hear it.  The whole movie works well together on every level.  To me it is has something very real in it that is worth watching.  I watched the original trailer and it didn't do the movie justice.  Whoever put the trailer together did not understand the meaning/depth to this movie. The trailer is put together so as to make it seem like it is a comedy. It is not a comedy.  It is the love story that is portrayed in a very authentic and meaningful way that speaks to me.  I would recommend to anyone to give this movie at least one chance. I love it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very interesting story line. Kept my attention.<br />Disfunctional becomes functional<br />I love flowers and it was fun to see their meaning.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game! I wish it had more levels because I could play this all night. Can't wait for more!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I am a fan of their music.  I bought this disk as a gift.  As far as I know the recipient enjoys the content.
1608871819|3.0|This is a solid movie book which sticks VERY close to what you see in the actual movie.  Which is good, but also bad.<br /><br />Marvel has set a new standard for their movie art books just like they have with their superhero movies and unfortunately DC also has some catching up to do in this arena.<br /><br />The artbook sticks very close to the movie and follows a lot of the art and design that went with that but LACKS in the conceptualizing beyond that or what took place before.  The biggest glaring omission is the complete lack of concept design for Superman's suit, probably the one major article that a lot of fans want to see.  There is ZERO concept art regarding the Superman suit/symbol/etc.  You know it's out there and for some reason, they chose not to include it here.  The concept designs that are in the book for the characters (Jor-El, Kryptonian armor, etc.) are already very close to what you already see in the movie.  The storyboard and environmental art follows this trend in which most of the artwork seen is a translation of what you see in the film, NOT of the thought process that was going on to visualize everything.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by sticking so close to final designs and the art of the film AS IS as opposed to the conceptualization, this book falls short on delivering what a lot of fans and aspiring concept artists want to see.<br /><br />On the plus side, the book does feature some spectacular art and in the text, they do dive into the background and thought process of the film creators.  There is a nice spread with some of the Kryptonian chest emblems but it doesn't range much past the House of El and generic Aristocrat #1, #2, etc.  You also get to know some of Zod's army which is called \\"The Sword of Rao\\" such as Jax-Ur who is a prominent Kryptonian criminal in the comics but is a scrawny, bald scientist in the film.<br /><br />I really would like to challenge DC on making these books better, whether its Warner Bros. themselves not allowing so much or the book's creators who don't want to dig so deep I don't know, but it is a nice supplement if you're a Superman fan, but don't expect much.<br /><br />And if you haven't already, I really encourage you to buy one of the Marvel movie artbooks.  They are how the superhero movie filmbooks SHOULD be.
1576875776|5.0|As someone interested in Street Photography this is well worth having. They are a brilliant portrayal of the era and remarkable that this 'passion'  of Maier's should have been kept from everyone.<br />A must for anyone who follows the genre of Black and White as well.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was the most fun I've had reading a book in a long time! I lmao at least once a chapter! It was funny, witty, sexy, did I mention it was fun as hell?<br />This entire book reads like the diary of a playboy. It's Drew's story, and he tells his story the way I tell my reviews, with side notes, \\"Ok, stop right here\\"'s, with his little interjections in the middle of his story telling. Of course I loved it! First of all his story style is the male version of my reviewing style, secondly, remember this has always been my favorite type of books, Tangled is told solely by the male lead character's POV. Everything about this book was a breath of fresh air! And yes, I'll admit it, I put Gideon down for Drew's story after only reading the first chapter. I was just going to read a little bit to see where to put it on my tbr list, but once I started, I never looked back, and dang I'm glad I didn't!<br />Drew is not only the baby of his wealthy family, but he is also the only son, and the child that his parents thought they'd never have (because of his mothers infertility issues). Now that I've explained that minute detail of Drew, you can see his every wish or need was served on a silver platter, and his every bite of life was from a silver spoon, therefore creating every single woman's kryptonite. Handsome, like fine as hell, swoon worthy handsome, wealthy, extremely successful, and all Drew has to do is smile in his tailor made Armani suits, and the panties drop. The ladies will say yes to any and everything he says or asks, just for a chance to have a moment in his life, errrr, bed.<br />Drew is the shark, the star, the prodigy his father always hoped would help lead the family  investment banking firm. And like a good son, Drew still loves to make his Pops proud.<br />Keeping to his Saturday night ritual, he and his friends are at NY city's hottest club, and he already has a lady lined up for the night and anxiously waiting for him at the table in the corner. However when Drew's eyes land on the brunette by the bar, ole Red at the corner table never enters his mind again. But the brunette isn't interested, I mean she is, her body is telling, no screaming that its interested, but her mouth says different, and hard as he tries, for the first time ever a catch hops off his hook! She turned him down! I know right? WTH?!?! Oh well, least he still has Red for back up.<br />The following Monday his secretary informs Drew about a slight change in his meetings for the day, a employee that his father wants him to meet pushes his 1 o'clock back. No biggie, at least until he walks into the meeting and it's then that he realizes why after he explained what he did for a living at the bar Saturday night, that her face closely resembled a cats, after it'd swallowed the canary.<br />Kate's life is the polar opposite of Drew's. Everything Kate has she worked her butt off for. She watched her mother struggle just to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table and promised herself no matter what, she would always be able to take care of herself, and take care of herself very well. Engaged to the man that has been her boyfriend for a decade, she knows Drew's game, she knows what he's selling, and she is not buying.<br />Drew finds himself in quiet the predicament, he's never been faced with a challenge, and he's never not gotten what he wanted, especially when it comes to women. And yes, he hears the words that Kate's mouth is speaking, but he chooses to read what her body is saying, she wants him, she just needs to stop fighting it.<br />As the story continues, remember just like pages from Drew's diary, his thoughts, you are a woman inside this man's head, and there are times you want to knee him in the groin, castrate him, shank him in the throat, however, on the other side of that coin your heart breaks for him, you're protective of him, and you really, really want him to get the love of this woman he is chasing, you want him happy, and complete.<br /><br />This book was so dang funny! That I can not help my self, I give to you, a Drewism's Montage:<br />*for bad language alter......<br />Drew explaining why he doesn't sleep with his co-workers, and will never sleep with his hot blond secretary Erin:<br />\\"No, I haven't screwed* her. Not that I wouldn't love to. Trust me, if she didn't work for me, I'd hit that harder than Mohammed Ali.\\"<br /><br />Drew at his 1oclock meeting with the new employee, Kate:<br />\\"The first is: God hates me. The second is: I have been a naughty, naughty boy for most of my life, and this is my payback. And you know what they say about payback, right? Yep. She's one hairy bit..*.\\"<br /><br />Drew falls, hard for Kate:<br />\\"But then she opens her eyes and looks up at me. And I can't look away. I feel like a king--like a freaking* immortal. And any self-control I had just vanished. I push into her, fast and merciless. Pure heated pleasure swells in my stomach and down my thighs. Sweet Jesus.\\"<br /><br />Drew is in a conversation with his sister while his 4 year old niece pipes up:<br />Mackenzie raises her hand proudly.<br />\\"I have a bagina.\\" I smirk. \\"Yes, you do sweetheart. And someday, it's gonna help you rule the world.\\" \\"Johnny Fitzgerald has a penis. He say his penis is better than my bagina.\\" \\"Johnny Fitzgerald's an idiot. Vaginas beat penises every time. They're like kryptonite. Penises are defenseless against them.\\"<br /><br />Drew is telling his big sis his opinion on teaching his niece Mackenzie that its ok to want to grow up and be a princess and marry a prince:<br />\\"You're a stay-at-home mom. Which is very commendable, don't get me wrong. But she should be exposed to career women too. And for God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her dang* shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break.\\"<br />Loved Drew's diary!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great revenge novel. Nice change of pace for Grisham. The plot twists abound and keep you guessing!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I had heard pros & cons about this CD. but I knew some of Luhrmann's work , & had heard some of the pieces, so I bought it. And I love it!!!
B003BM374K|5.0|Growing up these were my favourite books. Movie is a nice complement.  I wish they made more to go along with the series.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A very satisfying story with a happy ending. The perfect escape from the modern world. Inspirational gardening. Ties that bind.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The kid says he loves it.  Need I say more?  If you've never wasted time playing this game, what are you waiting for?  It's fun!
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Never having seen Firefly, I caught Serenity on cable one night.  I missed the beginning of the movie but thought<br />it looked pretty good so I purchased the series on Blu Ray and am in the process of watching it.  It's pretty good<br />for a TV show and when I finish watching the series, I will re-visit Serenity (Blu-Ray) to finish off the set.  I am expecting<br />to like both.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this. Makes you work your brain. I love the hunt for clues. If you like puzzles you will love this.
B00821OX98|4.0|Entertaining show with some plot holes early on. Will be interesting to see if they can fill them as the show goes on.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I will addmit it took me sometime to get used to the new grip and i love the recording for the macro and the fact that you can set up  all te keys to do something else.
0812982622|3.0|I did not finish this book. It is well written. I have no doubts it was worthy of a Pulitzer, but I could not read it. The first part made me so sad that I felt it was not good for me to go further. I am not skittish about reality. I realize there is human slavery and kidnaping. In the first instance of kidnaping (just as a practice run), the man was alone on a beach with his dog. After the man was kidnapped, the protagonist could hear the dog on the beach baying and said to himself that he would hear it the rest of his life. I still hear it just after reading it. The second &#34;practice&#34; run has a young woman talking to her mother on the phone when she is pushed overboard into the sea unable to swim and you can hear her mother calling her name on the open phone line. For those who can take this and perhaps see redemption later on, this is probably a very good book. As for me, I am too aware of the nonfiction victims who experience the same fate to torture myself with their cries even vicariously.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It does a good job and looks good as well, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is no pocket for a stylus.  It's not advertised as having a pocket, but it would seem to be something easy for Marware to add and it would be useful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addictive, i like it so much , more of these kind of games please, i can never get bored playing this one :)
1476734941|4.0|Very interesting to read, the first half is inspiring and the recipes are great but the middle part is anecdotal and doesn't add any value. Buy it and don't bother with the middle!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It's a mix of Slidders, quantum leap, X files, and maybe a little power rangers.  This show honestly made me choke up a few times. Jeez I'm a grown man.
B000W9399S|2.0|It's the story I didn't like!  I can see that Terry Pratchett can be clever with his words, but the story was just, MEH.  I don't plan to read any more of the disc world series.
B00005B36H|5.0|Just my opinion but this album is and probably always will be their best work. Not sure how many times I've bought it but I will continue too.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am using this application now and found very useful and easy to find downloaded files in my android mobile. With regards to the downloading speed, for me this is more reliable  and the better apps that I have encountered and also could indicate percentage of downloading time.<br />Very good apps and better than other applications for downloading Youtube.<br />Jbs
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game  the only problem is it takes to long to get a coin otherwise l would give it a five star<br /><br />Tv
B00004IC9G|5.0|Been looking to replace all my cassettes and finally completed my Manowar collection with this classic.  Definitely one of the most underrated metal bands around.  Brings back memories when I first herd it on my tape deck many moons ago.  A must for any metal collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app really isn't all that for those of you who still want to get it even though it is a pretty old app
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I still can't quite believe how exciting and nuanced this graphic novel was. Every chapter is masterfully crafted, both in terms of writing and panel pacing.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects about Watchmen is how there is equal weight given to what's said and what's drawn. The best example that readily comes to mind, is each time the young African American kid sits next to the news stand and reads his comic book the owner of the stand talks to anyone who will listen; as he does so, many of the things he says directly correlate to the captions of the comic and/or the comic's imagery.<br /><br />Watchman has amazing writing, well drawn artwork, intriguing juxtapositions, and so much more. Do yourself a favor and read this graphic novel.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|amazing hilarious should be rated pg-13 the ending is great i watched the ending three times before stopping. some sexual refrences
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am afraid I will have to read this book again.  It jumped around too much and I got lost.  I fully understand that this was me.<br /><br />I love this man,s writings.  He is a great story teller.  One of my favorite books is the Kite Runner.<br /><br />I just got a little lost in this book, but I will read it again and will look forward to his next book. I,m seventy nine and got lost in the names.  I will not give up.  I'll go back and read it again.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Michael Pollen has a unique way of blending great story telling with history and science. A must read this summer.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Eureka was one of my favorite television shows on the SyFy network. I have no clue if any of the science on there is even remotely true,  but a very quirky show that I'm sad is missing from the SyFy network this summer.  Guess I will have to make do with reruns!
B00AKFG15S|2.0|It is a pity that these chronicles have gone from high to low, and conitnue to dissapoint. Perhaps it should have been left only with the first book.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|All books written by Janet Evanovich are good books.  You will love this book and be compelled to read the next and the next, etc.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I did enjoy this book. It just about covers everything...Love, Hate, brutality, humor, gore, mystery, Super Sex, and I could probably come up with a few more adjectives, but enough said...I would recommend this book to adults only.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Acting was excellent. Very believable. Movie made sense as a pre Wiz of Oz movie, yet stands on its own as a great story.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Just a bio, spiced up with a grandiose vision of why his OBE is like any other ever in history... Pleez...
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am playing on my tablet very fun and easy to play. recommended to all gamers who love to play farm games
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game was great they made it a lot better than first game and I hope they can make a number 3
B007N5YJWK|5.0|This is a classic film.<br />A really \\"good yarn\\" as Hitchcock would say. Wonderful characters, thrilling story! Superb acting - Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll.<br />Hitchcock's wonderful wry sense of humour and playfullness.<br />Excellent bluray visual and audio.<br />I really get no enjoyment from Marian Keane's commentary.<br />However Leonard Leff gives a tremendous visual essay on the film.<br />Buy this one!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This seems to be a pretty good dvd. It is fun and entertaining. I put it on the dvd player as soon as I got it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written, easy read, and a very interesrting view &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;! I loved it and I had no doubt that Heaven existed prior to reading the book, it just made my beliefs stronger!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to do with my kids. it got them to think about what they discover and how it applies to the puzzle.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Best accessory I've bought! Charges phone or camera fast. Charges Samsung and Apple device at same time. Have recommended it to several people!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Goodo information about forensics in the form of the character &#34;Brennan.&#34;  Describes the situation of a woman who goes to the hospital bleeding.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|At times chilling in its depiction of hatred, this moving story shows the strength of family bonds and the sacrifice that family members make to protect the ones they cherish.
B009X01C64|4.0|I dropped one star because if anyone is looking for a thin and light Kindle cover this is not a good choice. At 14 oz and the weight of the Kindle, the weight of the package will come in around 2 lbs and just under one inch of thickness. Having said that, everything else about this cover is top notch. Genuine leather, perfect stitching, open - close standby, a tray that really securely locks the Kindle in place and three positions each for portrait or landscape stand. The 180 degree swivel feature allows you to keep the connections inside the cover when not charging and to swing it around to the other side to connect and charge. You will never have to remove the Kindle from the tray, which once it is in place is not that easy to release.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Take it from a 30 plus year Zeppelin fan  This is the greatest rock performance on this planet, A MUST HAVE.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|The Akinator is pretty fun. My sister and I try to beat it by naming old characters. We've won about 4 times, but it has won over 30. It's a good way to waste time. I wish it had been free, but it was worth getting it.
B00C5S5UUA|5.0|Perfect just like i wish, must have if you love Lego tec. A lot of good tips and solution to your projects
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I like the 2nd version better, but I had to get this one to complete the set.<br /><br />Seems like the more times you watch the movie the more you like it.  Combined with the &#34;Game of Shadows&#34; , this becomes a great re-working of Holmes.<br /><br />Plenty of action - Holmes now knows martial arts - and well rounded charaters.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Beautiful music straight from Pride and Prejudice!  Love the piano especially.  Great for anyone looking for instrumental background music to play around the house!!!
B009MF56GC|5.0|Expendables 1 was great and I couldn't wait to see the second.  Expendables 2 delivers!<br /><br />The movie makers pulled out all the stops when it came to including just about every action hero around.  This made for great action.  However, I like a movie that is humorous too.  There are a lot of inside jokes about each action superstar.  This can be funny or corny after awhile, depending on your viewpoint.  I liked it.  Never-the-less, the movie is worth getting.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Our son just turned 3 and he loves our kindle fire and other touch screens.  He enjoys doing puzzles and guessing the letters.  There are many activities in this game and he enjoys playing it and when we play it with him we make him pronounce the letters clearly and he is really learning his letters fast.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps you wanting another level.  was sorry to see it end.  I kept pushing all over looking for a way to get more!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I had heard about this series but never got around to watching it. Thankfully Amazon Prime had it avaiable. I watched all the seasons available over a two week time period. This is a well-written show with well-developed characters and enough plot twists and turns to keep it fresh.
B005LJITS0|3.0|I like the special effects in the movie, but the acting was mediocre. I'm glad that I ordered the movie. The best way to find out if a movie is worth watching is too watch it!! I love that Amazon has instant videos and as long as the service is available, I will be ordering again. The prices are fantastic and I love watching movies on my laptop!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I got sucked unto this series by peer pressure. Then got hooked. Catching up on season 3 now do I will be ready when season 4 begins.
B000SVZIDA|4.0|It was alittle disjointed in the beginning; i think the over use of special effects for a musical got in the way. But all in all it was entertaining.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I am not real big on violent movies but with Quinten Tarantino what do you expect. All in all a very good movie entertaining and sad but would recommend it
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I didn't mean to download it again. I already have it several time. sorry, I made a mistake. Now just let me delete.
B0032GITH0|4.0|It's not earth-shattering, but it will still move you and urge you to keep flipping pages. Although the murder itself tends to take a backseat to the goings-on of the Salmon family after about 30% of the book is through, by then you're invested in the family and you're rooting for them to hold it together. It's a very compelling story, but the resolution of the crime is painfully unsatisfying. If you're looking for a murder mystery-esque novel, this probably isn't it. That's what I was looking for in this book (it having been recommended by friends, I didn't quite know what it was about) but the family will pull you in if you're willing to let yourself become enveloped in their grief.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Would be great if there was a &#34;save your game progress&#34; or exit in the regular part of the game.. I have a problem with that.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a very clever<br />retelling of Sherlock Holmes, set in modern times.<br />I don't want to give anything away, but the series can be enjoyed by Holmes  fans as well as those new to the character.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love it..great game.. have the #2 version on my phone. This is great fun! I can draw with my friends and giggle at each others attempts to draw on these things! LOL! FUNNY!
B00821OX98|5.0|My boys and I  are able to watch all 3 series over the weekend none stop. Great family time. I would recommend this series as a part of bonding with ur family. It's a great watch for Adults and children over I would say 12. That's my tboughts.
B000WZAE1I|2.0|This film I can't believe Robert DeNiro had anything to do with. I used to admire his work, but am now losing interest in any of his movies. Not well written or performed in my estimation.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I read this book in two days, I didn't want to put it down. Jodi Picoult always manages to make me cry. Loved it.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|The entire Stargate series (including SG1) is ageless just like Star Trek. I can watch the repeats over and over again!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love this book.  I have children who have children of their own and it still makes me cry every time I read it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I listen to this almost every day while I am working. I think it is her best album she has made......!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Ive liked every other kanye album, but wow... this is half baked and really awful. There are a few moments of hope but they are few and far between. At best it sounds like an extremely rough first draft
B00454U1NS|5.0|Like everyone's greatest hits albums its great. Has most of her songs about family issues that are very heart warming and sincere.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was an incredibly challenging and fun app! My wife and I loved it! We had fights about who's turn it was next.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a great date movie with very good music and story line. I was thrilled to see Zac Efron as an sexy young adult. Kudos to his hairdresser.... what a sexy look for him. Time for him to get away from the mop top teenage persona. I would have liked better dialog and extended story telling but overall a great feel good movie.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Super Fun I Strongly Recommend This App! YOU MUST GET! I Have Tried Many Other Games And This Is By Far The Best
B00631HASU|3.0|This game is really good till you get to the point on either path towards the end. It's practically impossible to get by and if you don't have any lives you have to go back to the beginning of the path over and over again.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My son, who is 4, and I just watched it. It is very sweet and funny!<br />Great movie for a rainy day!
B0067R0APK|5.0|It's great to be have the weather for your favorite cities on the go.  You can keep track of what's happening weather<br />wise for friends and family.
B001NA6096|5.0|This was a great movie and I'm waiting for the third and final in the series to come out on DVD.
B007KDFWRG|1.0|Song starts wiih Derek, Wife sings like Bonnie Raitt, go into long Derek solo that builds, end song, repeat process.
0312427646|5.0|Having just completed a character study unit with my fifth graders, it was quite enjoyable and fun contemplating Her Royal Majesty as a reader.  So, it was with this mindset, \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" was read and through which each character was viewed.<br /><br />Truly touching, was the manner in which Alan Bennett captured the true souls of readers - those who find themselves transported by the words of others and allowing themselves and their ideals, to be questioned and reshaped.  Opening the book with the Queen having dinner with the president of France and engaging in a conversation about Jean Genet, the author, was truly funny!  The squirming feeling of being unread, was really hysterical to me, as this has been a recent reaction from several people recently in my company.<br /><br />Bennet's writing style was truly appreciated.  He possesses the ability to allow a reader to enter into a scene, both emotionally and visually.  This adds richness, depth and another dimension to the text.  An example of this is Her Majesty awkwardly entering the traveling library and hastily taking any book so as to immediately depart.  Bennett revealed his true writer's craft, making me, the reader, feel absolutely uncomfortable in the Queen's presence, as were Mr. Hutchings, Norman Seakins and the Queen herself.<br /><br />The Queen's nature was richly revealed (although I don't know if it's accurate, given I don't read much of her), as she dutifully returns to the van to return her book.  Mr. Hutchings is pleasantly surprised that Her Majesty completed her dry read \\"one finishes what's on one's plate.  That's always been my philosophy.\\"  So funny!  Shortly thereafter, the Queen is tickled to find she can keep the book, as the traveling library is downsizing.  I noticed the Queen didn't respond as jubilantly when she received a Wedgewood vase from a dealer (p.88).  Here, the reader witnesses the Queen, evolving into a devoted reader.  From this point on, we witness the Queen laughing aloud at what she reads, making excuses to engage in a book and surrounding herself with other readers, namely Norman.  The Queen's growing passion for reading continues as she questions her secretary, driver, her equerries, the prime minister and anyone else who comes into her presence.<br /><br />I felt really sad for the Queen when her love of reading was being squashed by Sir Kevin and others.  Particularly sad, but humorous was the Westminster trip, hiding a book under the cushion, only to return and find it having been blown up.  Her comeback line was priceless, \\"A book is a device to ignite the imagination.\\"  I also got a real kick out of the last ditch effort to have Sir Claude discourage the Queen from reading.  The whole scene of Sir Kevin visiting with Sir Claude had me laughing aloud, and then Sir Claude's visit to Her Majesty .... ohh, so very funny!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book! Found it fresh, thoughtful, humourous and just enjoyable.  I will definitely reread this book often, because it is such a delight!hing aloud at what she reads, making excuses to engage in a book and surrounding herself with other readers, namely Norman.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I can check local and travel plans quickly and thoroughly.<br />I love it and have recommended it to a friend already!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|so convenient to have kindle on my phone. I have my phone with me at all times and can read wherever I am and have a spare minute.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Thought this was a great movie!  I had a night to watch a me movie and this was it. It totally fit the bill
B008YKGQR4|5.0|My title really says it all so there's nothing more to add except that I'm glad I discovered this app!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I was not crazy about this movie.  Which bummed me out because I love Bruce Willis.  Unlike the original Diehard which I have seen many times, once was enough for me on this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this app is really good because my whole family play this game and they like it a lot
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.  If you have nothing else too watch, and do not mind some corny acting, give it a shot.
B003INBOE2|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST WING CHUN MOVIE EVER MADE. IT IS A MUST SEE ACTION MOVIE. VERY HIGH MARKS FOR THIS ONE.
1609611543|5.0|This book is written in a funny, witty and easily understandable way. I find what Dr. Davis has discovered very believable. The lifestyle change is not sugar coated, but guided step by step. If you are considering to buy the Wheat Belly Cookbook as well, just go ahead and skip this book, because most of everything is explained in the cookbook as well. I highly recommend this book if you have tried other diets and still can't lose the weight.
1781163243|5.0|It's helpful to people who drawing a concept arts.<br /><br />This book has especially many landscape pictures in it.<br /><br />I'm satisfied.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|They did a fantastic job.  Wonderfully updated special effects and picture clarity.  They definitely did not over do it.  Made it easier to watch while not disturbing the essence of the original (George Lucas take notes you soulless film murderer).
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I don't know I don't really like to read dictionaries but it was still not that bad for a dictionary
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This is a good &#34;followup&#34; to the Lord of the Rings movies, although it is technically a prequel movie. It isn't as good as the original three movies were though and we will have to wait for the second movie about Tolkien's &#34;The Hobbit&#34; to get to the starting point for the first three movies. Peter Jackson does an excellent job (as always) in the crafting of the movie - although in the 3D version, some of the combined closeup and long distance visuals reminded me of &#34;The Pirates of the Caribbean&#34; at Disneyland. It was fun to watch Frodo (Elijah Wood) appear as a younger hobbit even as the actor was nine years older. The consensus of friends and family is that this movie isn't as good as the first three, but it is worth the view.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I truly enjoy this game. Please add me! Love it. Great graphics and fun tasks. The only problem I have is getting friends on here. I gift daily. Also my little pony friendship is magic.  Fun game for kids and adults!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What an amazingly beautiful movie!! Ang Lee has made an incredibly powerful movie on so many levels --- the visuals, music, CG, story flow, and exploration of spirituality create an experience you will not soon forget. I highly recommend this movie!! And Suraj Sharma is incredible as Pi. He was not an actor when cast for the part after merely accompanying his brother to an audition for the movie.
B008RVAAPE|3.0|I found it a bit disjointed insofar that the story was difficult to follow as various new characters were introduced almost to the end. The end suddenly happened leaving me with wanting more.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I highly recommend this movie by Steven Spielberg! Even though it isn't 100% historically accurate, it captures the emotion, political, and civil war battles of the Lincoln era. Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding as our 16th president!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is not the best version of Minecraft but this a great game of adventure. In my opinion the computer version is the best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on level 5 but so far I really like this game. It's fun without being too frustrating. Free is always a good thing.
0670014893|4.0|Typical Le Carre ... the dry british humor is all the more enjoyable. All of this authors novel provide a background of facts that make them very informative and suspenseful.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Love it!! Can't find any others like it that measures up to The Lost City standards. Very challenging fun loads of fun!
6305511055|5.0|This movie grabs ahold of you on so many levels.  Sydney Pollack was one of the best directors ever and this is one of his masterpieces.  Robert Redford plays such a great role.  Your classic hero who is not a macho guy but is smart and doesn't play by the rules.  The story touches on many of the fears we have today about Big Brother operating illegally within our country and what could happen if you expose any of it.  Robert Redford's character gets caught in the middle as a reader for the CIA, a seemingly mundane, safe job.  He stumbles onto something he shouldn't have uncovered.  Once he goes on the run he is hunted down by the very government that is supposed to be protecting him.  The assassin who is contracted by the CIA is a brilliant character and has some twists and turns in the movie you don't expect.  All the way around this movie will grab you and take you on a ride.  It strikes at the heart of many controversial issues with our government today, making this almost a perfect movie to watch as we read in the news today.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Thought I was going to be watching a film based on how meth is manufactured in the Ozarks but instead it was concentrated on a realm where people's loyalty to each other is as fierce as the violence they commit to one another. A true juxtaposition that would seem impossible to write about let alone put it up on the screen. The author and screenwriter nailed it. Can't believe this didn't sweep the academy awards but can only guess that some people just didn't get it. I am definitely a late comer in watching this but so, so glad I did. I hope with the fame that  Jennifer Lawrence has attained since this was filmed, more attention will be brought back to this movie. It deserves every accolade it gets!
B002ZG993Q|3.0|First off, I am a George Clooney fan and I love a good spy movie.  So, when I saw this movie I was psyched.  The movie was okay in that it gave you a glimpse into the world of hired assasins, someone hiding out, blending in somewhere where they can't be found, kinda thing.  And he maintains no attachments by having relationships with hookers, etc.  All of that makes sense and seemed kinda like cool spy stuff.  BUT, the movie dragged, the main character that George Clooney played just seemed weaker than the person someone of his caliber was supposed to be.  And the ending was too melodramatic with him staring at the hooker he had fallen in love with as the life slowly drains out of him.  Please.  If your looking for a good spy flick with intrigue and cat and suspense, this just doesn't hold a candle to movies like Ronin, or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,Spy, or Spy Game, or 3 Days of the Condor, or any of the really good ones.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I read this book in two sitting.  This is definitely a good holiday read. Sit down with a cup of tea and don't get up till you've finished. Good fun and easy reading.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great film.<br />Very clever dialogue and Helen mirren is fabulous. Even Bruce Willis is good. A lot of fun. Good sfx.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This boook I downloaded as a free book and found it so informative that immediately bought the one that followed.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Great chemistry in this movie and very believable!  Loved it almost as much as the first one!!!  Very romantic and beautiful city for background!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish the characters were all so real and you can learn a lot about different relationships and people by reading this book.  It is well written and draws you in from the first page. I was sad when it finished. It was one of those books that made you feel you had made new friends.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have spent years reading these and what can I say. Anything you want in a book are in these. Ms. Harris has put into her books. I will miss them, so will have to reread them!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Sometimes there would be this weird glitch where there were no people,  cars, or sound which was confusing and could be fixed by doing a job or mission. Other than that, this is a pretty good game but it was a little pricey.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So fun. We play it constantly. Hope there is more levels! So far we are on level 10, we just got our kindle and this is the first game we love.
B0083SJG06|3.0|Writer/director Lawrence Kasden's take on the western legend known as WYATT EARP is a sprawling fictionalized biopic that has its strong points (well-defined characters, attention to detail, striking cinematography) and some weak ones (too much romance, an over three hour running time).<br /><br />Dennis Quaid went on a starvation diet prior to his Doc Holliday portrayal-- a highlight of this picture. Third-billed Gene Hackman as Wyatt's dad has a necessarily small role. Not one of Kevin Costner's better acting efforts. I've seen this one a few times and always come away from it with a feeling that something's missing. It's doubtful that elusive element would've been present had this been a six-hour TV miniseries, as originally planned.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.5) Wyatt Earp (1994) - Kevin Costner/Dennis Quaid/Gene Hackman/Jeff Fahey/Mark Harmon/Michael Madsen/Catherine O'Hara/Bill Pullman/Isabella Rossellini/Tom Sizemore/JoBeth Williams/Mare Winningham/Adam Baldwin/James Gammon/Annabeth Gish/James Caviezel/T&eacute;a Leoni/Lawrence Kasden (uncredited cameo)
B00BUT5I84|4.0|This album has a very similar sound to their last studio album. Overall I like the sound of the CD.
B007EECSFA|5.0|At first I thought this book began rather slowly; however I soon realized that the author had to take time to bring all of the characters to life.  It is a beautiful book of family, life, love, war and the secrets kept over many years. Don't be put off because of the length of the book; you will be wishing for more pages as you near the end.  This was my first Kate Morton book and I will definitely be reading her other books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game with my daughter. Easy but still made you think a bit. Not a big challenge. Simple and easy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Perfect mix of suspense, intrigue and action.  Kept my wife and me riveted.  Only wish there were more to watch.  I would highly recommend.
037582913X|5.0|Wonderful read.  Captures the child attention and keeps it until the end of the book.  Helps children deal with self-fears.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|It was a little scary when I watched it for the first time, in that these people have flaws. They have embarrassing  behavior but they are still good people underneath it all.
B005HEPJBY|5.0|I think this is the best thing since sliced bread. I have always loved star trek my whole life.Todays science fiction is tomarrows science fact.
0553386794|3.0|This book can NOT stand alone. It is not a complete story in any way shape or form. Do not commit to it without knowing you will have to wade into thousands of more pages and, perhaps, never come to any ending. It is well enough written, so if you want to read it, go ahead but if you want the short version I have to say HBO did a wonderful job of adapting it. I am still undecided as to whether to continue to the next book.
B001MM28JG|5.0|I think this is the best thing since sliced bread. I have always loved star trek my whole life.Todays science fiction is tomarrows science fact
B009Y6231U|4.0|Kinda reminded me of the story of ender's game.  Children raised to be soldiers.  But different than that story obviously.  Just watch it!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I have bought and given away over a hundred copies of this book.  It spoke to me in a way that no other book has.  I was ready to learn.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter loves her Buddy as she calls it! We never leave home without him! It his is actually one I bought as a gift for a friend! She had seen my daughter's and asked about it for her newborn. I highly recommend these! They're cute and pretty easy to keep up with! My daughter likes to rub hers as she falls asleep.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love it. Always a challenge to try to top my previous time. Great going against others. Great stress reliever! Try it
B00881VLCE|2.0|Downloaded fine. I really dislike the puzzle pictures supplied as demos.<br />The other three free and more interesting pictures failed to load.<br />The other pictures do not seem worth their price.
1400052173|5.0|A  wonderful story from both social and scientific viewpoints.  I worked with these cells back in the late 60's and now I know the whole history of them.  I truly feel like a part of an historical series of events even though this knowledge comes so late.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****<br /><br />I can't imagine that there is a person in the Western world who doesn't know or hasn't heard how season 3 ended, but just in case, if you don't know, then don't read this review.<br /><br />I loved this program. I love the characters. I love Maggie Smith, who is the reason that I found this. I used IMDB to look for some of her other projects and found this. Thankfully Amazon had season 1 available free for Prime users and I was able to catch up. I love Anna and Bates, I loved that story and I seriously considered buying a &#34;Free Bates&#34; t-shirt.  Then we get into season 3 and all of our time and emotion gets its just reward. Matthew and Mary marry.  Then, like an American soap opera, characters, people that I love, begin to die. I know, I'm too involved, it is just a television show, but it is a really good television show. It is like reading a really good chapter of a really good book every Sunday evening.<br />Having said that I just don't know that I can watch season 4 this winter. For the purposes of this review, season 3 was outstanding. Maggie Smith was incredible. All of the actors were truly wonderful, but I don't think I can stand the heartbreak this year.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I'm close to speechless after reading this book. Actually I listened to the  audio version which has an amazing narrator. The story begins in intense deep point of view and never lets up. In the beginning I was thinking , \\"Oh, well she's an interesting protagonist, and that's a dysfunctional family and a dysfunctional town.\\" But then that dysfunction builds and builds to a point you would never expect and just leaves you breathless. The characterization alone is worth the price of the book. Now add in fantastic author voice and a great story. I'm left with just one word- whoa!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Agatha Christie is a master of story telling, especially with murder mysteries. While this story has a lot of characters and it can be tricky to keep them all straight, it's still fantastic. I was intrigued from the first page and never knew what happened until it was disclosed in the epilogue.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|No lame song book here. Rod goes back to his original style that made him have a lot of success in the 80s. If you liked his albums before the song book years then this is your album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this app. Good time passer, fun!  Different and intriguing. Not too hard, not too easy. I hope more levels are added soon!
159463176X|4.0|I must say I very much enjoyed the first hundred & fifty pages but was somewhat disappointed the author didn't develop more of his characters adventures, particularly what went on in Paris with Nila & Pari considering the unbelievable sacrifices the family had to make.& ultimately endure. Nevertheless certainly a good book for a book club to fully discuss. I loved The Kite Runner & very much enjoy this authors beautifully told stories, so am therefore looking forward to another one of his remarkably heartfelt novels in the not too distant future.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Good Effects, Giants were hilarious. Plot was ok but predictable. In all it was a pretty funny and entertaining movie.
B0054U56B4|5.0|This was a gift for my sister and I make a summary for all the comments that she said to me in this word: Nice.<br />Greetings.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|UNO is a classic game that never gets old. I have played UNO since I was a small child and I still enjoy the upgraded version created. I am glad I can take the game with me on my Kindle. Great game for all ages!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|It's been far too long since Justin Timberlake's last album. I love this one. Great beats, smooth sounds, sexy rhythm. Love Justin!
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|The Smurfs is a fun family movie. Really glad the movie was remade and brought to the big screen. Neil Patrick Harris is smart, funny, and charming in this comedy. The smurfs are being chased by their arch enemy into a world they no nothing about. The smurfs must find their way back home before they are stuck in this strange place they know nothing about.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart's voice is rich and awesome. A great change of pace for the drive home from work. And Bonamassa is a bluesman.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Now This Is FUN!!!  VERY CLEVER &amp; thought provoking.  Hours of fun spent playing this genuinely clever mind bending little game.
B002JI94J4|5.0|I have the standard Collectors Edition and now this blue ray, and the blue ray is way more clearer on picture. The sound quality seems about the same. All on one disc is another three hours of extras. This was a great purchase to complete my Beatles collection. Now on to Help and hopefully Let It Be.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Living in the u.s., this story makes me realize how much I take for granted. The stories of the brave people who had the courage to defect their homeland will bothinspire and sadden you. Great read!
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This was a great movie about a great man.  Well acted, it might have been a bit long but still worth watching.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this games is fun to play easy to get addicted multiplayer needs more players per map u do to much walking around with nothing happening
B008J05EL8|4.0|It's nice to see your presentations, spreadsheets and documents in the format and fonts as they were created in Microsoft.
B0082Z447U|3.0|The story line and the way the story is presented by different people is good.<br />However, it is lengthy. At places I felt it is dragged unnecessarily.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|We have seen this many times and we never get tired of watching it.  It is a great classic and Orson Welles does a great job
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I thought that this was going to be just another cruddy game that my friend told me about but I was wrong. I love it!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|A fun game that will steal hours from you. I like to redecorate my town all the time. you don't have to buy anything to get the items you need coin hearts or acorns just play and itwill come. even the side game is helpfu. the game is a little slow somrtimes but that's ok.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|As usual Tom Cruise leaps tall buildings with defective equipment . Drives high speed chase in a sand storm using a tracking divice . The Mission is a sucess .
B009AMANBA|2.0|Didn't care for it.  Am African American and so freeing the slaves had a positive impact on some of my more recent direct ancestors, and I'm very grateful they were freed (otherwise my life would be horrific instead of being merely extremely difficult), but unfortunately film didn't work for me.  I like the director and lead actors, and will continue to look for their upcoming projects.<br /><br />P.S. If I had to give a specific reason for not liking the film, I guess I'd say it failed to emotionally grab me, it wasn't told in an emotionally engaging manner.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I watched the show and was make my own story lines . I was disappionted when it did go that way . I think that is the reason why I beleive the series seem to be much longer then it was .
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I'm a fan of Tom Cruise but sometimes don't care for his movies as he often plays alpha males at the top of their game and his character at few times, even during death defying stunts, ever gets much more than a scratch, making it hard for me to worry he'll make it out alive.  This film was somewhat different as he plays an outsider.  I didn't read the novels the movie was based on and so come into the story with no preconceptions.  I thought Mr. Cruise did a good job, I didn't care so much for the way the story had the character dispense vigilante justice, and I also disliked how the character took up the personal space of I guess was his female love interest.  I liked it better than I thought I would, but I didn't think it was a strong movie, some of the character's behaviors I liked, some I didn't.  I'd give it 2 and a half stars and would certainly watch the next one in the series if they continue with it.  Basically I'd say, didn't like it, though liked it more than I thought I would, but didn't hate it either.  It was okay and different enough that I'd watch Mr. Cruise in this role again.  Interesting to see him play older than he usually does.  If this character continues to perform immediate executions, I'll probably not be willing to watch the series.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The emotion that springs from family throughout all that life brings to us separately is love. These pages are beautifully drawn as only Khaled Hosseini can.  I was sorry to see the last page.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Safe Haven was a pretty good movie. I waited for it come out in digits because I didn't think it was theater worthy. After watching it I realized it was much better than the critics said it was. Both leads in the movie did an outstanding job. It was nicely written. Only draw back is it was a little predictable. But  over all a great chick flick.
1476733953|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I came across it on Amazon and saw that there were lots of good reviews, so I decided to give it a chance. I'm so glad I did because I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I've just downloaded the second book in the series and I can't wait to start reading it.<br /><br />I think that if you liked the Hunger Games you're going to love this book. There is a strong female protagonist who is a brilliantly competent workaholic. She gets things done. She solves problems and seems especially good at finding new solutions. For a society that lives by the book, her solutions are trouble. She goes up against incredible odds and manages to survive. Howey's writing style is wonderfully descriptive; I can see the Silo and what life was like inside it as if I had seen it on the big screen. Howey gives you little hints about what's really going on, tidbits that slowly reveal the bigger picture, as he tells you about life in the underground tower where everyone is supposed to do their job and never ever speak of going outside.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Read the entire trilogy! Long, but worth it. Very exciting and hard to put down, even for a senior adult. I have seen the movie of Erogan and hope they will produce the others.  Waiting for the next book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was more engineering fiction than science fiction. I loved the problem solving the characters performed, inventing things that they needed. It was both believably realistic and heartbreakingly human. I will read more in this series.
B00969GFFU|4.0|I thought this was a good read. I liked it. I am writing this review to rate the product. I much prefer Freedom to The Corrections, which I didn't really like.
B00BLGZDYA|4.0|\\"Holy Motors\\" is nearly impossible to describe - it really needs to be seen to be believed (or appreciated).  I've seen over 4,000 movies, and it is easily one of the oddest.  I often dislike films that try so hard to be bizarre, but this one works despite itself.  There's not much of a narrative here.  Mr. Oscar (played by Denis Levant) has a mysterious job that involves being chauffeured around Paris in a stretch limo driven by Celine (played by the legendary Edith Scob).  His profession seems to revolve around putting on various costumes and elaborate makeup and acting out different lives, including playing a disfigured old woman and a sewer-dwelling troll.<br /><br />Essentially, \\"Holy Motors\\" unfolds like a series of short films that meld together despite having little in common; none of them even have beginnings or endings - they're all middles.  If you want a linear narrative or a strong storyline, then you will probably hate this film. \\"Holy Motors\\" verges on pretentious, as director Leon Carax (The Lovers on the Bridge, Pola X) seems intent on confusing the audience and throwing everything he can at the camera.  A scene in which Levant and a female actress wear full body suits and writhe around as though simulating sex is particularly audacious.<br /><br />Yet for me, it ends up working despite the pretentiousness, mostly because of Levant's extraordinary performance.  To call him brave here is an understatement - it verges on insane and he's frequently nothing short of repulsive.  I've never seen anything like it.  I wouldn't say that I truly enjoyed \\"Holy Motors,\\" and I doubt that many will; however, I was mesmerized at times, and that's a sign of good cinema.
0743297334|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time, and, together with A Moveable Feast why I love Hemingway so much.

B003QSLDTA|1.0|I rented the movie and then when I pressed \\"play\\" it wouldn't play. I had everything I needed (such as Flash Player) yet nothing worked and as a result I paid for the movie and never even got the chance to watch it :( I am not satisfied and I would like to see if I can get a refund for the rental. Because if not, then I don't think I will ever rent movies or buy books/items from Amazon I the future. I never used to have any issues with Amazon so I really hope this matter gets resolved in a timely matter. Thank you.

B005LAIIN0|5.0|As a big zombie fan, if we watch World War Z, knowing it's intended to be a PG-13 movie, we'll know right away this isn't going to feature the blood and guts like any R or unrated zombie movie you've seen. Would it have been more drastic and horrifying with gore? Probably, but what is not seen and imagined can also be effective (see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre).<br /><br />Keeping that in mind, WWZ delivers on its intentions. Put yourself in the shoes of the lead character, and you're cast into a hellish world where a sudden outbreak of \\"rabies\\" as they first called it, spreads like wildfire in the cities, causing havoc all around. In a desperate effort to escape the horror, Pitt's character's goal is to get his family to safety, and in doing so, is obligated to find the origin of the disease that has taken over the entire world.<br /><br />WWZ is tension filled most of the way, and fills the screen with overwhelming amounts of zombies in some very unique and original ways not often seen in a zombie movie. These zombies are dormant shamblers when not stimulated by movers. But sound instigates them, and they sprint to \\"life\\", attempting to bite anyone who can serve as a host (which brings up a major plot point by the way). The ending sequence closes the film brilliantly, requiring some clever tactics along with agility and speed, as the zombies tend to amplify their ability to run and leap, oftentimes, jumping off rooftops, smashing to the ground, getting up and continuing the chase.<br /><br />Zombies Locations: Major City, Israel desert city, airplane, night time airport, day time airport, apartment building, Research Facility with white painted walls (which would have been perfect for some blood if this was R).<br /><br />3D: The 3D in WWZ looks very dimensional, with visible pieces that bring depth at a higher level you'd expect a 3D film to render it. A success in 3D, which also increases the dread of each horror scene. In addition to the powered 3D dimension, there are many instances where objects pop out of the screen, worthy of a good flinch back.<br /><br />Movie: 4.8/5<br />3D: 4/5ension, there are many instances where objects pop out of the screen, worthy of a good flinch back.<br /><br />Movie: 4.8/5<br />3D: 4/5
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This should be considered a must read for anyone studying 20th century history. The heartbreak of the sequestered life, as a small number of Amsterdam Jews try to survive in hiding from the Nazis, is intense. A great first person account, which proves that even young girls can become iconic heroes.
B005SEYOXW|4.0|Before watching the movie Serenity, a type of final hurrah for this unfinished series, I had never even heard of Firefly. I enjoyed the movie and, even though it's technically standalone, I got the sense that there had to be something before it because of the relationships between the characters. After googling the movie I discovered that it was based on a tv series that aired on FOX back in 2003.<br /><br />Firefly is a sort of space western with an entertaining storyline and enjoyable characters. The show was cancelled after about 14 episodes (I.e. season one) but it had such a zealous following by its fans that it prompted the creation of the film to provide a proper send off. In many people's view Firefly is a series that ended too soon (apparently due in large part to FOX's ineptitude).<br /><br />In my honest opinion, however, the series was great but not excellent. The first five or six episodes felt a little disjointed from one another and some could probably stand on their own. It wasn't until the seventh or eight episode that it seemed like they started taking into account the events of the precious episodes and weaving them into the story. I suppose the easiest way of explaining this would be to use Game of Thrones as an example. You get a more definite sense of continuity with a series like game of thrones, where each episodes' events shape the events of the next.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly enjoyable series and I recommend it. I gave it four stars because of the enjoyable story and the nicely developed characters. The disjointed nature of the episodes in beginning as well as its premature ending kept me from giving it 5/5. If you enjoy the series you will most likely have to watch the movie Serenity to get some closure.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Unique, different and fairly unpredictable, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a good read that ends a bit abruptly.  Like whether or not Rhett returns to Scarlett, the reader is left wondering what will happen to the children and Miss Peregrine.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was a latecomer to the Downton series, but once I tuned in, I was hooked. I loved Seasons 1 &2 so much that I bought Season 3 on Amazon and watched the episodes back to back. There are so many things going on in Season 3 - new places, new characters, more romance. Even our old favorites offer up a few surprises. The season ends with a cliffhanger that will break your heart.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Brutal sometimes, but always laying it out like it was and is still!  And I have a second- hand personal connection to Rodriguez, as one of my sons worked with him  in construction in Detroit, and still sees him in the Cass corridor.<br />I have played his music now since the Oscars, and &#34;I Wonder&#34;  is one of my favorites.  Once you get over the shock of asking about &#34;sex and who will be next&#34;,  Rodriguez  asks the really hard question!  &#34;Will this hatred ever end?&#34;<br />&#34;The Establishment Blues&#34; is another favorite.  When he says all the people are the same whereever he plays, this echoes<br />my belief in Baha'u'llah's statement that &#34;Humanity is One&#34;.  This is the main teaching of the Baha'i Faith, the single fastest growing World religion.<br /> I have all three of Rodriguez' albums, and play them almost every day, sometimes paying close attention to the guitar, other tmes the words, ALWAYS the Stradivarius violin on &#34;Coming from reality&#34;.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I love Jane Austin stories and I thought Romola Garai did a good job of bringing Emma to life. In fact, most of he actors were spot-on in their character portrayals.

0385344228|5.0|I reviewed this book a year or so ago through Bookbrowse.  My husband picked the book up in a used bookstore today, and I was reminded that I never posted the review to Amazon.  Here is it.<br /><br />Jacob was a quiet 14 year old kid who did not go around with the \\"in\\" crowd. He didn't have a lot of friends; he was \\"bullied.\\" And his grandfather was a murderer. Is violence genetic? Does it skip generations? Or can it be suppressed, while lying latent, waiting for some provocation. Is there such a thing as a \\"murder gene?\\" What responsibilities lie with the parents when faced with the accusation that their child may have committed murder? All of these questions come into play in this absorbing, well-written novel, which story rotates between the transcript from a Grand Jury testimony and the prior events that took place place following a murder. It offers thought-provoking insights into marriage and parenthood, and dealing with very difficult circumstances, and it is an excellent read.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album was not at all what I was expecting when I ordered it.<br /><br />It was so much more than I could have hoped for. Instead of the typical electronic dance tracks from Daft Punk I was greeted by a very 70's disco style album that gave me much greater appreciation for Daft Punk as musicians. They really showcase their full talents with this album.<br /><br />If you like 70's style music you will love this album. If you are expecting more Robot Rock style tracks you will be disappointed. But you should give it a chance regardless. It has quickly become one of my favorite albums from any artist.<br /><br />Truly a work of art.
B002EWD08Q|1.0|Glad this band didn't try to just crank out the same stuff that made them so popular in the first place. They deserved my full-price purchase as I greatly enjoyed their first two albums. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this album at all. If you were drawn to the band for their earlier work, I humbugly suggest you avoid this. I know there are many reviews here saying it's somehow really good, but I suspect many will be grateful for my unapologetic advice to avoid...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is very intriguing. it keeps you guessing as you try and figure out what to do. it would be helpful if there were some sort of instructions besides just having to tap all over the screen hoping something will happen. it does make you think and works your brain

B005DIA3DS|5.0|I've recommended this book to lots of folks to help them get acquainted with harder physics concepts without dredging up lots of math, but the real beauty is that the colorful way Orzel describes the concepts have helped me describe these concepts to others. I don't have a physics-heavy background other than general interest & elective reading, but this is easily the most accessible book on a heavy & difficult subject I've come across. This is one of the books I recommend to others most often. Great job, Orzel.
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|I kept waiting for it to get better.  I  kept thinking the ending would pull the book together but it didn't.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|It was pretty good for an action suspense film.  Liam Neeson is believable and there is lots of dry humor in here for such a serious topic.
B005LAII1C|2.0|I thought ted would be funny and smart, but most of jokes were either bad, offensive, or just not funny. Even though the acting was good, the story line was flat and predictable.
B00181JGI2|5.0|this is a unique movie.  And it is hilarious in a smart way -- none of that juvenile  humor like so many movies today.<br />This is not for children; content is inappropriate and they wouldn't understand it anyway.<br />I love this movie and recommend it to anyone with a smart sense of humor; it is a rich treat for those who can find humor where there is no slapstick stupidity. The Dude has the same last name<br />as a man of some repute who is married to a young chippy. One of them is essentially broke and relaxes at the bowling alley; the other is an older man administering a family trust. Others come looking for their money and mistake the Dude for the one who has the money.<br />John Goodman's character is fabulously acted and Jeff Bridges as &#34;the Dude&#34; is perfect. Julianne Moore is great as Maude, and John Turturro portrays a rival bowler to perfection.<br />I have seen this movie so many times i've lost count. I bought the dvd since it's about time for another Dude refresher for me.<br />I have gone into movie stores looking for a similar movie; I am confident as the sales people are that there is none like The Big Lebowski.  Enjoy; I certainly do, over and over.

B00004WNE4|5.0|If you are old enough to remember them, you know that this was one of the most under rated groups in 60's era Rock music. Everything they did was both cutting edge and superb. In the music industry everything is about timing and presentation. Sad to say this group was not well presented in the industry and by time they became known they were already history because the group had split up. This pressing is fully up to presenting the material covered with superb accuracy and the wonderfuls sounds presented by the Zombies. Gotta get you some!

B004ZJADNQ|5.0|1977's Bad Reputation finds Thin Lizzy abandoning their wild rambunctious energy that was so prevalent on Jailbreak and mostly there on Johnny The Fox. This was a turning point for them. Bad Reputation is an overall darker album and if you like dark, this is one for you. Starting off with Soldier Of Fortune, it has another preachy intro with that soundtrack style whirlwind of sound in the background before those awesome twin guitar lines come in and remind us, this is Thin Lizzy, we are going to rock. The song doesn't rock in the sense of Jailbreak of Rosalie or Rocky. It has a dark but still very alive nature to it, the chorus is melodic and powerful and it's post chorus lead lines are great. It even has a marching drum beat in the 2nd half set to some very atmosphere guitar parts infront of that epic what sounds like synth whirlwind again. It's a pretty awesome song but audiences at the time still expecting another Jailbreak were probably confused, sadly. Not only is Lizzy darker here, they are even heavier still. The title track. It just cooks, it's a monster of a song and qualifies as heavy metal, for probably one of the few times in the bands catalog until they would do Thunder & Lightning in 1983. This song is pure attitude and has some blitzkrieg Brian Downey drum work and a slightly more mid shifting (serious to more melodic uptempo) lead lines, it's actually kinda brilliant and how they combine 2 different moods in one song. It's a masterful Thin Lizzy track. Opium Trail continues the harder edged stuff. A fast paced rocker that is sort of strange in that it pretty much demonstrates Phil's growing fascination with heroin. But nonetheless the song rips. Southbound is another Boys Are Back In Town clone, but its still a great semi ballad/light rocker. Very melodic and pretty, although it does suffer from slight over production. The Live & Dangerous version is more stripped down and in that sense, works better, but the studio version gets its point across. Downey's drum sound here is worth mentioning, it's crisp and has plenty of punch. The obligatory \\"greatest hits\\" track here is Dancin' In The Moonlight. Another youthful tale of street romance, it kinda sticks out in amongst all the darkness here. It's almost a pop song, it has saxophone and is very cheerful and fun. But oddly enough, it became a staple for the band and one of their most popular songs.<br /><br />Killer Without A Cause roughs you up some more with some blistering guitar work. The main riff is just okay, a minor highlight but there's sections of great lead work and in the 2nd verse the song changes vibes and adds some acoustic guitar work behind the electric riff that really helps the song rise above what could've been a pedestrian track. And to be honest in most bands hands, it would've been. Whats really interesting is here, there isn't one ballad or slow song, whatever you wanna call it in the bands prime years body of work that you could call bad. Lynott was a true master of writing beautifully emotionally touching songs. But Downtown Sundown actually isn't one of his best songs, there's some nice delicate guitar work in it and it does work pretty well but it doesnt quite tug at your heartstrings the way Fight Or Fall, Old Flame, Borderline or The Wild One could. And also keep in mind this is the full emergence of Lynott exploring his more darker tragic fantasies here. Oddly enough its the ballad that takes a backseat to the more aggressive material. That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart is another of the tried and true light rockers that were one of 3 main styles you find on any Lizzy album. It's got a good dark vibe balanced with some fine acoustic punctuated with electric guitar work, but it doesn't have a prime main riff. The album closes the way it started, epic atmosphere and darkness. Dear Lord starts out with some vocal orchestral work that soon evolves into an extremely underrated heartfelt \\"light rocker\\". The lyrics, the message, the music,it's blindingly powerful. Lynott sounds as pained as he ever would on an album here and it proves his stance as one of rocks great artists once and for all.<br /><br />Bad Rep is a dark record indeed. Most of it was recorded without Brian Robertson who had injured his hand sometime prior in a bar fight. Scott Gorham rose to the task to record most of the guitar parts although Robbo did eventually show up and recorded some parts here and there and apparently him and Lynott were not on good terms at the time. It would be his last record with the band, thus ending the classic period of Thin Lizzy. Its also of note this was produced by former Bowie/T.Rex man Tony Visconti. A great producer who made great music with Bowie and Bolan but his production here is a little muddy, it sounds just like Johnny The Fox in a sense. But it hardly hinders anything. And in a way might've even been the intention given the dark nature of the material. Even the album cover itself. Pure black with 3...not 4 members of the band on the cover and that stenciled font \\"Thin Lizzy, Bad Reputation\\" Message received here. If Johnny The Fox wasn't a hit album a year prior, this certainly wasn't going to be and the depressing feel of the songs would ensure that. After all 1977 was the year of Kiss, the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, as well as a huge year for disco. Who had time for dark songs of soldiers, drug use and spiritual poetry. Sadly the general record buying public didn't. The albums a classic, don't miss it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the game very much.  This had just enough challenge to keep you going.  I have recommend this game to others and they found it very entertaining.  Cannot wait for the other floors.  Just one negative:  If you accidentally touch another function on your device,  you will lose the progress of the floor your on.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I waited months to watch season 3 via Amazon Prime and wasn't disappointed. Storylines never get stale and the acting is superb! Looking forward to season 4!
B004EPYZQC|2.0|If you like ridiculous stunts, this is the movie for you.  There isn't 10 minutes of reality in the whole movie.  It's just a series of stunts that would never happen that way in real life mixed with fake fighting scenes.  I've seen enough of these I can't be impressed watching the stunts, I just think this is stupid. I used to dislike James Bond because everything was fake but it's more real than this.  Lots of money and lots of stunts make for big box office, but I'm bored with all the cliches.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book because Harold took his complicated, dull existence to new heights through clearing his mind by the simple task of just walking.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|A bit over the top at times, but then again this is a movie about a children's story.<br />Fun interpretation, and nice cinematography. Characters were developed in bit of a spotty fashion, but not too bad.<br />Cool special effects.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|easy and enjoyable reading.  for the price you can't go wrong. I expect great things from Mr. Howey in the future.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Functional micro usb cable. 5' is a good length. If I need another 5'  micro usb cable I will buy this one again. :P
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Lovely.  This book was a lovely escapist adventure.  The feeling of the book is oddly sleepy and dreamy despite some intense moments.  It was a similar feel to the first time I read a Wrinkle In Time.  Thoroughly enjoyable, a definite recommendation!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Fantastic game! 99 cents well spent. Awesome graphics and fun to just swing around downtown. Highly recommend getting this game.Spider man rocks
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I opted for the Sample before I purchased.  It is a unique story and a rather fascinating tale.  It involves Knights, Direwolf's, Wights (Ghosts/Magic/Specters) Lite Romance, and a realistic depiction of the hard live in the 15th Century.  I will share with you that I purchased the second book.  Martin has me hooked and I will read the entire series.......
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app only worked once, I've tried multiple videos but it won't load and sometimes it pops up vtube not working I am so glad it was free
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed all three seasons of this series.  This one is probably the most pivotal, and sad, but it stayed interesting and hard to turn away from until the last scene.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app so much. I can't stop playing it. Everywhere I go I am playing it. I am so glad it doesn't need Wi-Fi. I am so glad I have this app.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Johnson's ability to bring Jun Doh to full, rounded creation made for an enlightening, sometimes transcendent, yet most often an emotionally painful read. The Orphan Master's Son should be required reading for any history lover!
B00821OX98|5.0|This under rated science fiction television series will surprise you, if you liked Walking Dead you will love this series!
B00AKO93JK|1.0|After being the free app of the day, the now added Google billing permissions and network information (sniffing) to the already network access.  Now the app is dangerous. 4 stars to no stars.  Lots of apps doing this lately.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|I use this app on an old android phone that I'm no longer using for calls - just music.<br />This does the job. nothing fancy. If you are looking for a feature rich player, I wouldn't recommend.<br />But if you just want to listen to your tunes and chillax, why it's FREE!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I devoured this book and thought about the characters when I wasn't reading it. Romantic and tidy but still satisfying.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The language in ths book is lovely. It reads like poetry, with a page turning plot, and characters that you want to know more about. I loved this book, and was disappointed to finish it. I hope that I don't  have to wait long before Mr Hosseini writes another novel.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was an awesome book. A little different than the movie but a great read. Would highly recommend it everyone.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This movie had great action scenes and explosions! The plot had me glued to the movie the whole time! Overall awesome movie. I highly recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I wouldn't buy this book because of all of the negative reviews.  When my fellow book lover bought it without reading any of the negatives I told her what I had read about how bad the book was......As she read the book we discussed what was going on.  The bad reviews did not reflect what she was reading!  Then the end everyone was complaining about wasn't bad for her.  So I bought and read the book.<br /><br />Here goes...<br />The book is a continued LOVE STORY about Gideon and Eva.  It also is a story about the people in their lives that have been introduced in the first two books.  Eva is a stronger character that is actually ignoring the crap dished out by his exes.  They are building a wonderful relationship!  Yes it seemed like Eva was picking fights at first, but he had broken her heart and he understands that she has been really hurt by what he did and is just lashing out at him due to her fears.  They are working through everything that is being thrown their way.  What is so wrong with that?  The negative reviews just don't describe the same book that I read!!!!  We are entitled to our own opinions, but just don't let that sway you to not read it and make up your own mind!!!  The book ended...yes just ended...but with the promise of another book that will continue to tell the stories of ALL of these wonderful characters..I hope this review will help someone who was in my same mindset of not wanting to read it out of fear of what the negatives were saying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The solutions are fairly obvious once you see them,  but they can be very elusive while you are trying to solve them.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another fantastic novel from Follett. Historical fiction wrought with moving details and intricate characters. An instant favorite. I can't wait for the next in the series.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book. Very amusing. My only issue may be the slightly trite ending. I did love reading it a lot.<br />The &#34;twist&#34; was pretty obvious but no issue.<br />Highly recommended.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great mystery but enjoyed the cultural aspects woven into the novel as well. I'll be reading the rest of this series as well.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid. Watching it as an adult I can appreciate this cheesy, campy, totally fun movie on a new level.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Very good acting. Based on a true story, so you know you'll cry a the end. It was a very heart-warming movie with great footage of surfing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a massage therapist and a writer.  I use an ipod for the massage music when I go on housecalls, and I also take my kindle fire along and use this app for the background effects to accompany my music.  It's like having a portable fountain to take with you on a housecall.  Pretty cool.  Right now I'm working on an audiobook, and I'm using this app to complement my narration using various effects depending on what I'm reading.  Unlike the old fashioned sound effect machines (and I've owned several...) you can mix and match the sounds which I really like.  The possibilities are endless of what you can do with this app, and well worth the $2.99 price tag.  Okay, I confess that I got it when it was the free app of the day, but before I got the free paid app I had the free one which I replaced.  It's still a great price, and if free is more your style (like mine), the free app is still out there.  Enjoy!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is amazing. This is the second time that I've read this book and I still feel the chills like it's my very first time reading it. I can't wait to finish the rest of the series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Down loaded this for my 4 yr old granddaughter, she enjoyed this app alot!!  Easy for her to use and the colors are so bright.
B00CAKCS9O|5.0|John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale meet and fall in love in New York but aren't sure if fate is on their side. Cheesy but you don't feel cheesy watching it. Similar to You've Got Mail.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series this is my second time reading it, would recommend this for anyone who likes a page turner book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I personally liked the ending of this book. It left many possibilities. It also made me think about the character of Nick. His neediness and the lack of ability to do what most men would have done. Is the book totally believable? No. But who cares, it was an interesting read. Things just don't always work out the way you would like.<br /><br />Like one reviewer said, some of the greatest works of literature had strange and quirky endings. Sad endings. But that is what made the books so thought provoking. And provoking thought is what a good book should do.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|NO I really did not like it!  It was very childish and not in a good way, Expected the Wizard of Oz...
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This wasn't in theater very long but got some good reviews. I agree with the reviews. Very entertaining! Beautifully shot. Decent story and some good acting. Graphically violent!! Scene that stuck with me was when 3 guys got thrown off a balcony. Definitely worth a watch if you like Sci-Fi. Also, if you're looking for a good action movie, this is it. It won't win any Academy Awards but if you don't care about that, then watch this.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing but I do not know if I am learning the skills needed to play with real tiles but I do believe I am catching on. Always a fan of the pause button. Great game.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|The critics are giving this movie low reviews.. But in my opinion this is a great family action fantasy movie. It brings back those thoughts you had as a kid when you first heard the story of jack and the beanstalk. Overall its a great movie and has a good cast and great special effects.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Reading the negative reviews on pressing quality almost made me skip over the amazing deal I found on this set.  I am definitely excited that I took the gamble.  Perfect pressings.  Nice, quiet black backgrounds.  Beautiful mastering.  Perfect reproductions of original packaging.  I couldn't be happier to own this set.  Get one.
B0014EVO4M|5.0|Eddie Vedder really did a great job on this album, This is a beautiful album,specialy that is base in a true history.I really recommend this album.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This is a passable action flick with gore that is more graphic than usual.  It seems to be an attempt at an historically accurate tale of a slaves revenge.  The language reverts to modern speech fairly often and the accuracy is suspect.<br /><br />Several fine actors do their job well.  Dicaprio plays a southern gentleman villain well.  Samuel L. Jackson is a hateful Uncle Tom.<br />Jamie Foxx's performance as a rebel slave works.  The evil German officer from Inglorious Bastards does it again.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino delivers freshly shocking violence.<br /><br />Not bad, if that's all you were looking for.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far I really like this game. There is always some new twist. I think the creators have done a great job.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|At first I liked the game. At least till I hit level 6. I passed it, barely. Then I got stuck at level 7. It seems like the levels got harder before the should have. I was unable to pass the level at all. I was able to get some of the gears, but this was all moot when unable to get him in the box.<br />I think the concept is great but it wasn't well thought out nor tested to determine difficulties. Sadly this game was too difficult for me and I chose not to opt for finding a walkthrough or set of cheats.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game because you basically have your own world with your own choices.If you got it from 6/14/13 you got the updated version of minecraft!
B008JFUPFI|4.0|I'll make this short and get to only the important things, everything else is a waste of time to talk about. Remember just as many women saw this movie as men. The movies was 2 hours 23 minutes. The first hour was by far the best sci-fi, alien, extreme technology, krypton, superman piece of cinematography, and realism with compelling twist and turns (they thought of everything) I ever seen ever in any movie, at this point in the movie I turned to my wife and said, \\"this is the best movie I've ever seen to this point\\" and she said yeah me too\\". Then 5 minutes later the fighting started between Clark and Zod, and his peeps. Oh, my God it wouldn't stop!! The fighting went on non-stop for an hour and 10 minutes, it was absolute torture and the women who went to see this movie for the romance, some light action and fantasizing about the super hero hunk, were likely vomiting in the aisles like my wife was after the first 40 minutes of non-stop blown gasket complete destruction of what appeared to be a city the size of new York, it was 911 30 times over and over, and over. After 40 minute you were sick and still had to endure 30 more minutes of extremely loud destruction. Why they couldn't have shown Clark passing a physics test so that at some point during this 70 minute fight someone couldn't have outsmarted the other and put this superfight and city destruction to rest. Anti-climactic and stupid, he snaps his neck, sorry just don't buy the retarded ending to ZOD. Wow, the stupidity. In their defense if there is one, which there is not, the storyline where Clark meets Zod and defeats him is always the more negative and less inspiring of all the storylines, with too much fighting where no one seems to win. Wow, I'm tired just thinking about this.<br /><br />I may still buy the movie, not sure, but what I am sure about is I will fast forward through at least 40 minutes of fighting and destruction, so I'm not pissed off again watching a movie that previously had the best hour and 5 minutes of movie I have ever witnessed. Special effects in this movie are off the charts like no previous superman movie. Anyone who was not conscious of this hour plus of pointless destruction without anyone winning for 70 minutes and not being aware and fully aggravated by this continuous waste of time using computer special effects for all of it is an idiot. Those who loved the movie and didn't point this out are an idiot. It ruined a perfectly good movie that could have for the first time for a superman movie won a number of awards. The superman actor is by far the best actor for this character ever, who has the convincing thickness of a fully competing body builder with perfect proportions and chiseled facial construction like those superman faces in the comic books, who by the way don't look real because they are too perfect. They should make many superman films with him.<br />The Storylines, the cinematography, the special effects combined with the story were fully unimaginable, yet they did create them, many of them, fantastically so, and continually surprising you with the newest ideas for the story, that kept you entranced for the 1st hour . .  I want to buy the movie just to watch the 1st hour. My advice, hold you breath and you ears for at least 30 minutes of the hour plus fight or you'll leave pissed off like we did. 4 stars.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I read this book in one sitting. The characters were believable. I started this book with chick lit expectations but it is so much more than that. I can easily recommend this book.
B002MFULQO|4.0|Far from what we are taught in school. But this makes more sense than what the government lead the citizens of the United States believe.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I remember the Green Arrow series from DC Comics back in the 60's. I was a fan then, but this new series from the CW blew away all my expectations. It's stylish and interesting, the writing is very good and the acting is very solid. I'll own the Blu-ray when it is available.
B00ADMZUVO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting a well presented, good read. Also, the mini-series followed the book closely too, thus doubling  my entertainment pleasure.
B001MSMULG|3.0|Intriguing story line that moves along at a quick pace.  Seemed to deteriorate a bit toward the end, but worth a read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun i luv this game! Awesome! I hope u like this game to and that u luv playing this games.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I read, yesterday, that a Boston based Bank has implemented kiosks with interactive video. Of course, customer and a remote clerk interact to help customer with complex banking transactions completed.  This seems to apply new technology, in a way, that prioritize human interaction and its right for working.<br />Prof. Brynjolfsson calls our attention regarding the fact that excessive use of technology could lead to job availability crises.  Something like Terminator. Not so cruel maybe. This problem has to do with lack of knowledge by workforce and business tendency to lower costs with the increasing benefits goal in one hand and the fact that technology moves very quickly. So quickly that its very hard to keep pace.
B00C061I3K|5.0|It's a great album, they have intertwined their musical style with famous musicians and created a masterpiece. The chessiness of the love songs, the groove and the infectious beats are great and will renew passions as you listen.
B00571F26Y|4.0|While readers can skip certain &#34;information overload&#34; parts that go into far too much depth with medical terminology (especially when certain chapters don't pertain specifically to them), the information in this book is necessary for consumers. It is educational, interesting, and enlightening. The doctor's many stories about his patients validate his points. I've felt 100 times better since giving up wheat. Swearing off sugar is proving to be more difficult. A must read! I want the recipe book now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Simple, yet engaging game - a wonderful diversion when you have a few extra minutes. Great for kids, still interesting for adults.
0783240287|5.0|While in high school, I was able to perform in \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\". I really enjoyed it and love the music. So when I found this, it was an obvious buy. Donny Osmond is wonderful in the part of Joseph. My daughter enjoys watching it with me, and she is 7 years old, she loves the music. It is a good quality DVD, and a great addition to your collection.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|There has never been, nor do I think there will ever be the confluence of circumstances that  allowed &#34;The West Wing&#34; to come into being. Given that, the ensemble cast and fabulous writing guaranteed it's success. I am very happy with my purchase of the entire series to relive the surcease that I experienced upon first viewing. Most of the dialog is still current and Aaron Sorkin's witty teleplay still evokes an unexpected belly laugh.  I only wish our current administration had the courage, integrity and principles that the series maintained until the very last season
6305878323|4.0|Who doesn't love the movie? The is an excellent DVD with everything I would want. It is also a great price and it gives me an opportunity to watch the movie whenever I want with my daughter.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|When I first got this book I didn't think I was going to like it but I was WRONG! It is the best book I read by far. Definitely something I would recommend for other kindle users. :D
6304698623|4.0|This is a wonderful story, perhaps not exactly according to the book, but beyond that, as a movie, it is excellent. A heart felt story of a little girl who believes her dad when he says that every little girl is a princess, then loses him and her life takes a drastic change. She is able to continue to believe she is the little princess that her father says she is and sees the magic in the world. In a drastic turn, she finds her father again and is reunited with him. It is a wonderful movie, and I enjoy watching it with my daughter.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Some raunchy humor as one would expect, but seems like it was rushed to capitalize on Cohen's reputation.  Ok but thats about all.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Twisted (in a good way) and keeps your attention, even though it moves kind of slowly.  I would recommend it.
B00BMVHWHA|5.0|First off I'm biased -- I adore Willie.  But truth be told -- this is one of the best studio albums in recent years.  Some of Willie's albums seem to fade into obscurity -- neither this title - nor \\"HEREOES\\" (last years release) will be lost in the shuffle.  Great songs -- love Marie the Dawn is Breaking, and the title track.  If you only buy one Willie cd now and then -- make it this one.  It's solid -- well crafted -- and VERY evocative of Rick Rubin's Johnny Cash albums.  It's as if Willie goes full circle -- and he did -- he's back on his home -- Columbia-Sony Legacy. A-.  It's not Stardust but still really up there.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved the book.  I thought Follets  research into the history of the time made it more compelling and gave me a better view of the life of  various stations and how they evolved.  Especially how the plague changed the lives of the peasantry
B00B769XB8|3.0|It is a mix story of movies, but it fine for an entertainment. So nothing is very special in the story. the support is very good in 3D and the uncut bluray.
B005KELWJY|5.0|It's a good protective for your Kindle as you have a little card sleeve. I feel my Kindle a now protected in a very confortable way to transport and to read. I recomended this folio because you have everything on reach (bottoms, conectors) and the way it holds your Kindle is appropiated.
B003B2C92G|2.0|I was waiting for a good transfer on that technology support but it a disappointed picture quality. if you haven't buy it yet so don't. you will be regret !!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Really makes you think! I wish there were more levels. Hopefully, there will be more soon for us to play.
B000EZ7ZXQ|4.0|It is original story about as the groundhog day movie but with the girl who didn't remember anything about the day before and she starts over again and again until a guy come along and fall in love with her. He find out the way to keep her attention....
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Very easy to follow. Great book for older teens or young adults. Good love story. Hard to put down I read it in 3 days! First book I read by Jamie McGuire and now I plan on reading many more from her! Thumbs up!
B004YCKITI|3.0|I like it, but it is an classic killer movie nothing special the story, we can guest the end. I though you can play it once, if you are a collector.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I've tried and tried but all I get are error messages when attempting to open this app. It either tells me that there was a problem when I try to sign in or I get a parsing error message. I've uninstalled and re-installed a few times and it still doesn't work. I gave it 3 stars anyway only because I have it on my laptop and it works well on that. I love my Kindle Fire too.. but I'm about ready to give up on using this reader on my phone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game that makes you think. Levels get harder as you go along. Needs to have more levels. great way to kill a few minuets.
B000NY12LO|5.0|What a riveting story! I found myself thinking about the story for days after finishing this book. What a great story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I know I have a.kindel fire and it works fine an its vary easy so much fun u should try it I liv it
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. I found the story just drifts. It certainly doesn't grab you. I got half way through and decided to read something else.
B0063IH60K|5.0|NEVER thought I would like the game of solitary unroll I tried this app. I REALLY LOVE THIS VERY AWESOME APP OF SOLITAIRE.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If u like temple run u will love sub way suffers me and my cusins play ot all the time
B000HZM4FW|4.0|This is a must see movie. Jack Nicholas is at his best. He captivates you and hold your attention to the very end. The end is definitely not what you would expect. Great movie. Enjoy!
0446530573|5.0|I love watching the Sopranos on TV and I own all the episodes. I bought this book and the day it arrived I heard the news that Tony had died in Rome. It was sad, but I have this book and at least in part he still lives on. It is written like the Sopranos are a real live family. Makes it fun to read. The receipts look good, but I have not tried them yet, but I will real soon. I do not regret buying this cook book and I will eat like a Soprano real soon. (ps Why did the stop making this show in the first place, best show ever on TV) God love you Tony Goodbye
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Many books are enjoyable but not all capture your heart like the Hunger Games Trilogy.  A great read!  I wanted more!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I spend good time playing this game. Love it! I enjoy playing with my son as a friendly competition and the game gets harder as you progress.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is a wonderful new album by Rod Stewart, who is a legend like the Beatles and the Stones.  The one song that truly stands out is \\"Pure Love,\\" which is backed up by an orchestra.  It is very special, and is likely to join his other classics.  Well done . . . and worth buying!
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really liked this movie because of the twists and turns that come up when least expected,  I also thought the hip-hop music soundtrack complimented several of the scenes throughout the movie very well.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Had just received my new ROKU 3 from Amazon. Set it up and this was the first movie I streamed! What a delightful choice!  Excellent film.  Wonderful cast, music, and story.  Dustin Hoffman directed this excellent comedy regarding aging and finding joy during what can be a difficult time of life.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Nice follow up to original film.  Some nice new inventive sounds & fitted well with emotion of story & this guy really does know how to do film scores!!!<br /><br />Admit the music to first film is more rounded & all inspiring this is a nice add on for anyone who loved the original film score.  I did expect the end score to be another 9 min roller coaster however did not get it but as film scores go Michael G. delivers where all other fail!!!<br /><br />When's  the next Star Trek? For when it comes to all inspiring, emotional scores this is hard to beat & if you don't have music to first film - highly recommend!
0345455681|4.0|This was a Father's Day gift for my dad. He read the first novel, New York by the same author and enjoyed the story. I figured if my dad enjoyed the first story he would certainly enjoy the next novel.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|not a bad place to shop im happy w it as for now doe rae me fa su la te do
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I liked the movie.  My only wish was that they played out the &#34;who is the wicked witch?&#34; plot longer.  Some of the performances did seem forced, but you try doing an evil witch cackle naturally.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|it is ok it makes u think but still have fun not like playing out side to keep active doe
B008EKOIN8|5.0|From the very first page, Michael Pollan lays out a premise that helps keep the balance of this sustained essay focused and compelling: that cooking, that prosaic activity, can be an important step towards self-reliance, a stronger family, and a healthy community. I hadn't thought about that before. I'm grateful for this insight, and for the journey the author takes me on from there.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun but I got stuck a lot so I used cheats to help me. Will play more to see how long I keep it before deleting it..
B007THA4FI|3.0|It's hard to find a character to care about in this book.  Most have no redeeming characteristics at all.  However, J.K. Rowling's flawless writing kept me I interested to the end.
075669812X|5.0|My grandson loves this book so much he completely loved the first book to destruction.  This does not mean the book is flimsy!  It was well read and referenced many, many times a day - and slept with a few times!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I'm trying to shine the flashlight into the lockbox on the floor on the 4th level so I can get the last item inside but it won't work so I can't move on....NOT COOL!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Though the first third of the book moved slowly and there were some scenes that seemed extraneous, it was a good read.
1401234550|5.0|Sinestro goes green and it is cool. The story is very strong it basics are about what is evil and what is control. As Sinestro has to deal with that. Hal is deal with being away from being part of the corp also Carol.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I would have to say this game is impressive. It somewhat reminds me of Diablo 3, with the story line being the return of demons as well as the way you spend your skill points for passive and active abilities. I would say I dislike the combat at times. You can be overwhelmed  quickly, though I cannot say all classes have that issue or that the blademaster (what I am playing as now) learns crowd control moves (I only have a few hours in so I'm only lvl 7). I haven't had a chance to PvP or play with others yet but I think the idea was sound, so I hope they were executed well. Due to the thoughtfulness, style and the way the game the plays, I have to give it 5 stars.
0812982622|5.0|This book is imaginative, action packed, and completely otherworldly. It is books like this that restore my faith in the future of literature.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It isn't great literature, but I enjoyed it as a love story - unusual, really, but still a love story.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|has a lot of action but the plot is mediocre. Ewan McGregor does a great job as always. Would recommend
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|This is a more humorous version than the 2003 remake.  Obviously, in 1969 they didn't have the special effects and other cinematography capabilities they do today, but still pretty good.  Interesting twists on the story line between the original and the remake.<br /><br />I think the new one would have been better had I seen the original first.  If you have never seen the remake (2003 version) watch this one first.
B00785P2QC|4.0|VERY NICE , BEST GAME SINCE A LONG TIME!<br />Check it! I will check the other G5-games in the next TIME, but im sure they also great.

B0092S4WLY|1.0|I simply hate this game. It doesn't tell you how to play, no tutorial, and is extremely hard at any rate.
B007HO392S|5.0|I bought this album for my parents. They love Carrie Underwood since her days on American Idol. I've listen to the album and it is really good. I recommend this to anyone.

B007SGM084|4.0|I downloaded the trilogy for the airplane ride, nightly reading and beach reading during my honeymoon.  I'm only on chapter 3 of the first book (didn't ready much)!  Now that i'm back from the honeymoon, this will be my bus book for a while!

B00821PCJS|5.0|exceptional story lines. keeps you guessing. makes the possibility of an alien invasion seem feasible. never miss an episode and look forward to Monday nights
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|This album is typical George Benson. He croons and sets the mood for enjoyable listening. I recommend this for all lovers of Nat Cole.
B007R0WHMK|4.0|Good beginning. Got a little slow at times. Should have been made 30 minutes shorter. Acting was very good. Strange twist
B000FC146C|5.0|I first read THORN BIRDS when I was raising my then young family. During the kids naptime I would lose myself in the characters and awesome story!<br />I had to have the digital edition when it released because in my eyes it is a classic.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Amazingly awesome! Fingers crossed tightly for a Pitch Perfect 2!!! This soundtrack makes me want to join an a capella group, unfortunately I can't sing. Lol

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love this show and the added caracters this season make it all the fun to watch.  As soon as the series goes on sale I will purchase.
B00AMEZZUE|5.0|There's every reason to pay attention to Lou Doillon.<br /><br />She's the daughter of Jane Birkin (yes, the inspiration for the Birkin bag.) Her half-sister is Charlotte Gainsbourg. She started acting at 5, and has appeared in 80 movies. Tall, stick thin, she is the face and muse of Givenchy. And, last year, at 30, she launched a music career with a CD called \\"Places,\\" which astonished its creator and the French audience alike when she was named best female performer of the year at Les Victoires de la Musique, the French equivalent of the Grammys.<br /><br />\\"Places\\" deserves every superlative you can think of. And not only because it's an astonishing debut. It's music that comes from a deep place. A place that, if you've had a romance or three, you know very well --- these songs are about longing, regret and desperation. Mostly, I think, desperation, which is, for Doillon, the inevitable result of a primal need for connection that comes close but always seems to miss. The upside: the modest hope that if we name the pain it will dissipate and we might do better next time.<br /><br />Doillon's voice is a marvel. On first hearing, you think she's gone to school on Amy Winehouse, but you very quickly move on to Billy Holliday and Nina Simone. And in the lyrics and the measured cadence, Leonard Cohen. An early memory: \\"I'm in my father's car at age 9 or 10 crying to Leonard Cohen's `Famous Blue Raincoat,' thinking that you could write nearly a love letter to a man who betrayed you by having an affair with your wife. I was thinking how wonderful and pure music can be for explaining situations.\\" (Age 9 or 10? Well, her father is a film director. And French.)<br /><br />The CD begins with \\"ICU,\\" which she calls \\"a sad song for sad girls.\\" It's addressed to a lost lover, much missed: \\"I see you in every cab that goes by/ in the strangers at every crossroad, in every bar.\\" It's slow, almost spoken. And more powerful because of her stage persona, which is none: \\"I like the idea of going on stage without makeup, without the hair being done, in the jeans and shirt I've been wearing all day.\\"<br /><br />The song that alternative radio will play is \\"Devil or Angel.\\" Again, the subject is romantic difficulty. But so far from pop platitude:<br /><br />\\"I'll never quite understand why we love to carry on wars as we do/ I haven't yet opened the doors that your bullets are already flying through/ And I wish you'd stop claiming you surrender/ Lay down the gun if you do/ You accuse me of standing guard/ But wouldn't you/ Honey you are so quick to skip from praise to slender/ Devil or angel I'm not one or the other/ And I'm sorry if I, if I disappoint you...\\"<br /><br />Wise words. But so are these: \\"What is the most intimate is actually the most universal. The more you're writing absolutely honestly, and absolutely bare of intention --- even if it feels absolutely personal and small because it's at your own scale --- other people relate to it much more.\\"<br /><br />I relate to Lou Doillon. Totally.dea of going on stage without makeup, without the hair being done, in the jeans and shirt I've been wearing all day.\\"<br /><br />The song that alternative radio will play is \\"Devil or Angel.\\" Again, the subject is romantic difficulty.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This third novel is another good, thought provoking novel from Khaled Hosseini.  He is so, very good at weaving a story through the generations that live in his books.  Once you read one of his novels.....you know you have to read all of them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, challenging game at times.  Can't wait for more levels. Will try other games like this. I recommend this game.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Item delivery very quickly.Story line continues and gets faster and better.<br />Love all the new characters that are introduced and the boyfriends are cute!!
6304457391|5.0|LANCASTER AND DOUGLAS ON THE SCREEN TOGETHER IN THE ULTIMATE COLD WAR CLASSIC. SCREENPLAY WAS BY THE MASTER HIMSELF, ROD SERLING. THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Love these books!I was hooked on them really quick and vey addictive!!<br />I got up early to get the newest release as soon as it come out!!<br />Easy read and four friends characters are intriguing and very sexy.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Another great  start to a trilogy.  I really enjoyed this movie but a little long so be prepared to start viewing it early or to stay up late.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Great delivery time on this item! Could not wait to get it tarted to watch where i left off from last season.<br />Plot thickens and new villains are finally revealed!! I love the characters and the new developments!
B00008NRI7|5.0|Enjoy the movie.Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are great together. It was good entertainment and a great couples movie. Will watch again.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I enjoy this show and all of the antics and quirkiness of Patrick Jane.<br />Good episodes and fun to watch, Good delivery time on items.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|There isn't anything not to like about this movie!  It is funny, creative, and sweet with a surprise at the end.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|No spolier alert.. sorry.. This is not your usual Hale Berry Tom Hanks film. I loved the concept of life offered in this movie. I will say you will want to watch it a second time after seeing the closing credits.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a wonderful book, though not on par with his earlier works which were exquisite.  i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I knew I would have to wait for video because it is so long. Worth seeing if you like Hugh and Anne. Excellent job all around. Most of the singing was better than expected. Excellent supporting cast.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A little reptitive. But fun and solvable. Fits into a short time frame. I recommend this game. My kids enjoy it as well.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I was always anxious to get to the next episode! I even got my husband hooked. With two young kids date nights are hard to come by and TV time is limited.. We watch one series at a time, and this has been a favorite!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Addicting game but only can visit three friends each day. Used to be able to visit all friends. Hard to accumulate acorns. Game needs a better way to win or earn them.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this whole CD.  It's unfortunate that it has to have an adult lyric sticker, because the curse words used are pretty uneccessary to the music, but this is a very good CD!  This man has an incredible voice!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Too many characters & past events not realative to central story line/plot of this book. Of course Sookie is going to end up with Sam; he's the only logical character to be picked from this hodgepodge of entities.
B00BDSRISA|4.0|Phoenix have always had an eclectic approach to song-writing, so it shouldn't be a shock that Bankrupt! arrives from a slightly different realm of inspiration than its spunkier predicesser, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.  If you're a fan (and by that I mean someone who enjoys all of their music, not just Wolfgang), then I can guarantee you'll like this, no matter how different it feels from their last album.<br /><br />Fortunately though, this discrepincy between Bankrupt and their previous work isn't all that disorienting, and a lot of what the band has capitlized on these past few years remains fairly recognizable here.  While it is a bit slower than Wolfang, Bankrupt still delivers lots of fun and good listening: they know how to catch your attention, and their melodies will stick like barnacle.  The mood feels introspective,  (think back to their short interlude, Love Like a Sunset Part 2 off Wolfgang... or the sweet melacncholy sway of North off their abum, It's Never Been Like That).  I love this particular side to the band.  As always, Mars's vocals manage to seduce with their authentic coolness;  his voice is like honey, and no matter where he is tonally, it just feels perfectly listenable.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for any fan.  My favorite is tied between Chloroform and Bourgeois.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I purchased the Audible version as well as the Kindle e-book and I am still smiling!  I listened to the audio on my morning commute and laughed the whole way to the office.  I would read a chapter or two at lunch (when it wasn't convenient to have my headset on).  My Kindle would magically sync to where my audio book left off!  Listening to Bossypants in Tina Fey's own voice is like having a private comedy show with no one around to hear you snort from laughing so hard!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case works well and looks good on the iPhone 4.  This product maybe cheap but Amazon did good with this.  I would recommend this to others.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|I've been a Black Sabbath fan from the beginning - through the Ozzy years, the Dio years, and the reunion with Ozzy.  While I regret the loss of Bill Ward, the product that has come out of it sounds just as good as Sabbath ever has - definitely worth owning!!<br /><br />\m/ ^_^ \m/ SABBATH BABY!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not my favorite of the series but I still enjoyed the story and more history about Gideon.  Lots of romance and the secondary characters are interesting.  Wanted more !!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This movie was different from what I expected. It was thought-provoking and had a surprise ending. Not just another movie about a car.
1600595871|5.0|This is one of the best book-making books I've seen! It has many, many examples and great instructions. I find it very inspirational!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is a good game and is something that the entire family can enjoy. Both my girls like to play.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Never imagined that this fantastic ballet could be turned into a fantastic ballet!!! unforgetable experience!!! The new story was VERY touching,strait to the heart and the dancing is spectacular,plus the drama in which it's all involved,STUNNING!!!!Highly recommend!!
1608871819|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2OBEDWOPW9LKW]]I wasn't very impressed by this Man of Steel art book. It's not bad but it's not that good either.<br /><br />There aren't many character designs. Strangely, Zod's the only character with art featuring various designs. The rest of the characters, including Superman, are just shown with one or two illustrations or photos. The designs are the finalised ones. There's nothing on Superman's new suit besides the brief mention by director Zack Synder that underwear outside is no longer cool nowadays. The cover does have a nice embossed S with repeating patterns from the fabric of Superman's suit.<br /><br />The concept art are generally nice but there aren't any mind blowing pieces in particular. There are some beautiful detailed pieces but also pretty rough ones. The overall tone is quite dark with a sense of grim throughout. There's a preference for the strong use of shadows, either to obscure detail or to suggest I'm not too sure, but I feel it's for the former because the detail I want to see usually fades into the shadow.<br /><br />The art feels quite static. Environment art are meant to be static but I mean those scene paintings with characters. There are many pieces with characters just standing on location. Superman usually stands alone staring into space. Comics usually have their characters in dynamic poses. Not so here. And there aren't any storyboards. You won't get the idea that this is an action film from the art.<br /><br />There aren't any set photography on the props and locations. Most of the photos included are film stills, mostly portraits, but they look great.<br /><br />The commentary is quite insightful and focuses on the design and direction of the film. It talks mainly about the interpretation of the characters and stories for the audience that are so used to superhero movies nowadays. There's not much on the actual production shoot and stories behind the scenes.<br /><br />Those who have watched the film would probably enjoy this book more but that would also depend on what you're expecting.<br /><br />I recommend flipping through the book before you buy.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)enjoy this book more but that would also depend on what you're expecting.<br /><br />I recommend flipping through the book before you buy.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game except the new update that only allows three random friends visits and  expect us to do certain challenges. Change that and it's a ***** from me.
1401324649|5.0|My daughter recommended this for me and did she ever do a great thing. I had a dad who I can imagine doing these things. I had my dads picture the whole time I read this book. It didn't take long to read it. I was too interested in what Alan was going to do or get into.  I would recommended this book to every one!!  Gaye
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This book has been a joy for me.  Some years ago I attended a wedding gathering which was one of the best experiences I have had.  The love I was shown at this Indian wedding I will never forget.  And these are my lifelong friends.  So this story brought back a host of memories.  Absolutely loved it!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|It's hard to say much other than i didn't expect much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised.  The whole movie is a bit tongue in cheek, and dont watch it expecting to have your life changed, but it's a good, fun, zombie flick that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was hooked on this game for the whole hour it took me to get through the 10 levels. Wish there were more!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I love the temp and what it actually feels like.  Wish it were hourly.and had more details regarding impending rain.
193700788X|5.0|I hate for these books to end.  I love Sookie and all of her adventures.  I am excited with the ending.  I think everything came together exactly as it should.  Don't read unless you have read the first 9 books.  You will not be able to follow along and it will spoil the other books for you!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I knew it'd be good but the twists & turns were awesome. Especially the end!!!! Looking forward to book 3!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very fun and realistic. you get to drive around and rescue animals and you advance very quickly through levels. Awesome
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it. It is like the move, and so much more. Love the big fires blowing things up he he
193700788X|5.0|This book is a great ending for a fantasic series!! Eric does exactly as we should expect, he stays in character--out for himself!! I personally will miss reading more about Sookie and her crew, the entire series was well written and everyone stayed in character-unlike many series I have read. Big thumbs up Ms Harris and thank very much for hours of reading pleasure. Hope we hear from you again!!!
B005HSL626|2.0|I LOVED THE APP!Then it got upgraded with awesome features but half way thru a game it freezes and have the restart the app =/ please fix this problem.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|quick download for Kindle Fire HD 7.  highly customizable. screen color can hide stopwatch if not going to download it. multiple timers. vacation setting.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It is an excellent description of how peopel tend to see others people miseries and forget their owns.<br />It takes place in a small town in england but it could be anywhere, in any small town around the world you could find people with this caracteres...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this and loved it. Then read the prequel and loved it even more. Waiting for &#34;Dust&#34;!  Don't let the  2nd part deter you! It's worth getting through!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a great game for people who don't like games that come to an end the only thing I don't understand is that the brake button makes the vehicle go backwards.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Good acting all around, the kids liked it (younger one was scared a bit).  My favorite character is the little china girl.  Great special effects.  Highly entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best puzzling game I have ever played its not to hard or to easy.it's unique gets you thinking while enjoying yourself having fun at the same time.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and my family and I adore it very much!  It is cute, funny, and above all, you really start to care<br />about the characters......even if they are cartoons!  Would recommend for families with small children that like animated movies.
0316224588|5.0|I've read every book in this series, so I'm biased.  It's one of the longest running, best written, and deeply human series in the detective canon.<br /><br />John Rebus is a very well drawn, highly flawed character who has aged for decades since we first met him.  This is his first book after retirement, which you know could not last very long.  Now he works as a consultant for the same force he worked for in the prior books.  Of course, he's just as sarcastic, quick to judgment, and full of vices as he has always been.  However, he is getting a little more reflective and it serves him well in this tale of missing youths from a long while back.<br /><br />In addition to a great story, there's a big element of interdepartmental politics, big time media coverage, and the emergence of social media as both a bane and a blessing for the police.  On that last point Rankin does a great job and left me wondering why we haven't seen more of that from other crime authors.  Watching Rebus try to understand Twitter is worth reading the whole book for.<br /><br />As always, Rebus always moves ahead knowing that inaction is the biggest mistake.  He takes quite a few unusual chances to solve the crimes, and it mostly works.<br /><br />I'm ready for the next book in this fine series.  Thank you, Ian Rankin!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs is talented and wonderful. This CD is no exception. I love listening to his music while I drive.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the author told a compelling story of his experience in having his scientific view of spirituality completely changed. I have held a strong belief in a afterlife. This book confirms the validity of my belief.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie!! Daniel Craig was super and so athletic and Judi Dench was outstanding.  Great action all of the way through.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I think that Game of Thrones has become the show that all other subsequent fantasy shows will be compared to.  The show takes twists and turns that I cannot anticipate (having not read all the books yet) and keeps surprising me.  While not always pleasant, it keeps me riveted and wanting more each week, and now that season 3 is over, I really miss it, so I've started reading the books.  HBO has spared no expense with this show; the acting, writing, special effects, costumes, editing, sets - all of it - is top notch.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about the show is how no one person is all good or all bad (except, maybe Joffrey...).  I find myself rooting for a character who I previously disliked.  You grow to understand these characters and their journeys are fascinating.  Even friends of mine who would never step foot in a theater to see Lord of the Rings, are watching this show.  The fantasy element is completely secondary to the excellent storytelling.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show and hope that many more people give it a chance.
B005HSL626|5.0|Addicting game! Can play all day if i can even beat the game. Nice app, they have different difficulty levels.
B00821OX98|5.0|I do not watch much TV in general and if I do it is usually on Demand via Prime or Netflix. I started watching Falling Skies and it kept me well entertained. The story line is pretty good and that's what kept me coming back to watch the entire season.<br /><br />The actors are doing a great job and the acting comes over very well. A group of survivors (2nd Mass) fights for survival and resistance against aliens. The characters are real and I think that's what drew my attention. It is not the typical super-hero stuff and people are vulnerable.<br /><br />Apparently Steven Spielberg had his hands in this TV series and I think you can clearly tell. I am now on the second season and the high quality of acting has continued.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this all day, It has custom levels and is great when you are bored. If you like solitaire you will love this.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I became so enamored of &#34;Little Alchemy&#34; I had to search out another game to &#34;feed my obsession.&#34; This immediately caught my attention. When I added fire to water, I got alcohol! Oh, if only it were that easy!!  Still, Zalkin's Alchemy is a lot of fun and has many surprises.. I spend way too much time on it, but it's good to know there can always bee a little sunshine in every day.... if you know the elements to combine!
B0007N1BBC|1.0|The DVD was immediately returned....it did not play on any of our DVD devices.  It almost appeared to be a copy from another DVD.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I liked it. It was different. It was also quite sad. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I will just say that after watching it, I am more sympathetic to the W.W.of the W. Nuff said.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|This game is amazing but I beat the yeti boss and loaded the next level when the app force closed and wouldn't let me. PLEASE FIX
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This cute game is entertaining, BUT the controls need work. The character either won't double jump or will stop moving in midair and fall to his death...or BOTH. It gets frustrating the 10th time around. Aside from this, I like it.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great movie!  Well acted and non-stop action.  If you like westerns, you will love this, although it takes place in the French and Indian Wars.
B001E25MBK|5.0|The Godfather series is a phenomenal series and getting it on Blue ray is as good as it gets. Some people complain about the transfer onto Blue Ray, which is utterly ridiculous because Blue Ray highlights special effects and regular movies don't have any, but I assure you the transfer is fine.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I had really looked forward to this movie.  But my expectation was greater than the product.  It was okay, the scenery was really beautiful.  The story line was okay also, just over all the movie just didn't have the zip I thought it would.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Music, dancing. Get an idea how a Broadway show comes together. The cast is immensely talented and that is what I enjoy.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Old school video games for the parents and new for the kiddos! Bridging the gap in a fun way movie for anyone who loves video games!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Fun game for all ages.  Some are easy to find but some are difficult, but most of all it is a relaxing game to play.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying the challenge. You start off with 4 basic elements and you build bigger things combining those elements and other things that you make. Will definitely keep you occupied for hours trying to figure out the many different combinations to be had.
B008UX2UIO|4.0|Enigmatic, silly, outrageous, creepy, audacious....it was all of these and much more! It is difficult to talk about the author and his place in this world...it makes you wonder if he were talking about himself...There were times when I wanted to put the book down and never finish it...other times when I could not put it down to do important things in my life.  I am glad that I read it... I am sorry that the author committed suicide...it leaves a hole in our reading. The book is not comparable to anything I have ever read.  You should definitely read it.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|This is a classic. It never gets old! It is definitely scary :) would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch scary movies and actually be scared!!!
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I would suggest this mostly for any supernatural fans because the are many things to catch up on from previous seasons. certainly made my collection better
B009R659L8|5.0|Very good book. Kept me interested right up till the end. As always, Mary Higgins Clark has done it again. Keep them coming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|In my twenties I had a horse and have many wonderful memories of my time with him.  I love this app because the graphics are very realistic and I'm having fun with a horse again!  This works great on my tablet.
B00BF123WG|4.0|While I have no idea how much of what they dramatized is even close to reality, it was a great storyline!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|For those of you who enjoy some Quentin finesse, this movie does have it's moments.  And great ones to be sure.  However, it's a hard sell on credibility and simply doesn't stack up to the quality flicks that we've come to love like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. It's a good one-timer, then move along, move along.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Really exciting book to read on weekends and weeknights! I love the whole series. It's the best book of the whole series.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I really like Bradley Cooper and feel this was one of his best perormances.  Love the Movie, and wanted it for my collection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great story of inner strength, fueled by emotional challenges. Characters are motivated by a desire to protect more than their own well being but the greater good in society. The trilogy is captivating from the opening word to the last.<br /><br />Anyone looking for an adventure story, love story, sci-fi, or political thriller will love this.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|I had heard about this story and wanted to see for myself what it was about.  What I did not expect was to be so enthrauled and moved by what went one.  Great movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My five year old enjoyed solving  the puzzles with a little help from me. Hope there are more levels soon.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So nice to be able to easily download new and favourite books for my Android tablet and I love the way it &#34;syncs&#34; several devices too.<br />  Thanks a lot.
141659521X|4.0|An offering in the Mitch Rapp series is one that lands on my \\"get as soon as available\\" list. \\"The Last Man\\" did not disappoint. Since the death of Vince Flynn indicates that there will be little new (one or two in the production cycle it appears), I would recommend that any fans who haven't read this book get a copy. It's not the best of the series, in my opinion, as the first few titles were superb, but it fits comfortably in the midrange of the series, which makes it better than most of its competition.<br /><br />A little too much petty personality backstabbing backstory for my taste, but if there weren't numerous examples of incompetent, self-important swine in positions of influence, it wouldn't be a Vince Flynn novel -- he really seemed to take pleasure in tweaking the self-righteous climbers that appear to be so ubiquitous in public (dis)service. The action sequences were good, although Rapp sometimes appeared to be too lucky to make the scenes resonate as possible, but that again is vintage for the series.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I watched the walking dead on TV first and the comic is close enough to the series to keep things familiar but different enough to keep things interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't pulled an all-nighter in 25 years but I pulled 4 of them while reading these stories.  I simply could not put them down.  If I started to doze off I would wake suddenly needing to know what happened next.  I want every single person I know to read this series so I can talk to them this story.  And I'm dying to know what happens next, so I'm buying book 6 in about 2 minutes...
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|A good movie from a content perspective.  However, with a lot of noisy action in the background, it was difficult for even those not hearing impaired to hear what the main characters were saying...combine side comment volume with explosions and you will find yourself doing multiple rewinds to catch the comments.
0156027321|5.0|This is a great story in that you read almost the entire book - it is fascinating & believable - and you enjoy it right up to the final pages when you discover you had no idea what the story was really about.  Never saw that coming.  So few books whop you like that.  Definite read.  Just in case a reviewer spoils the ending, don't read anymore reviews or talk to anyone about this story until you turn the last page.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Overall great game, fun and addictive. Not too hard yet not easy either. You look forward to what task the next floor/ level has in store.  I like it because it's a hidden object game too. .........keep up the good work.
1932907009|5.0|Skip all of the McKee junk and just get this book. Its easy to read, funny, very well written and keeps it simple.  Don't let the other books that over-cerebralize writing get in your way. Too bad Blake is no longer with us.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Saw Emeli on Tv and fell in love with her voice. Had to have her CD ASAP! Couldn't find it in the stores locally.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put my Kindle down-he is such a wonderful writer, involving you in the story so much that you have to keep reading to see where he is going-I have recommended this book to four others!!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I've never read a book by Nicholas Sparks, and generally am not a big fan of his films, but between &#34;The Lucky One&#34; and &#34;Safe Haven&#34;, my opinion is starting to change. I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would, which surprised me. I enjoyed the cast, the wonderful music featured in this film, the plot, and even the little twist at the end. It was a great film, and the scenery in this film and cinematography were amazing.
B009EFP278|5.0|loved this CD.  I would recommend it to every one.  Super glad I purchased this CD and wouldn't hesitate to refer it to others.  Will be looking to purchase other CDs from this artist.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this game, I really like the graphics, I definitely have to rate it five of five stars. Good job! :)
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I loved this CD.  I would recommend it to every one.  Super glad I purchased this CD and wouldn't hesitate to refer it to others.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|Or I'd probably like it more. It's cute. Kinda fun.... I just can't do it very well :-( I'm not usually good at video games much anyway. It's not the games fault.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A period series giving a glimpse into a changing social order and culture as a result of ecomonic changes hastened by a world war. Entertaining, absorbing and well acted good scripts and story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|this book is wonderful, and the refreshing new perspective from Death is beautifully written. liesels relationship with all the characters evolves slowly, and it really makes you feel like you've known her forever
B003G4W49C|3.0|It was a good story, but it left me NOT wanting to read any more Card. It will be interesting to see how they convert this to a movie.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|This analyzer is unfriendly to use and a little difficult to understand compared to &#34;speedtest.net&#34;<br />I am sorry to say this.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I have been a Joe fan for many years and have his entire library of work in CD form, computer, and on my portable devices. This is one of his best creations to date and I find his music getting a bit more complex with great melodies, but also a touch of quiet low tone background riffs that make one listen to every note with great intensity. I really love this CD, and you will as well.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|They stayed true to the sound of the early years, Iommi is still one of the best, and I think ozzy sounds great. buy it, you'll like it.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|This one moves along better than some.  Good finish!  I like it when things end cleanly!  I also like a little romantic twist.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Even though I like the spin on the usual Disney fairy tale, Charlize Theron plays a rather unjust witch. She's basically trying to stay young by killing off every other girl in the town. She's fairest of them all until Snow White comes of age and grows fairer than her. Snow White is then hunted by Chris Hemsworth, and he not knowing who she is, finds himself helping her. Good concept, bad story.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Sleepy Time app for a while. I used the rain and campfire sounds nightly to help me fall asleep. I never worried too much about variety until recently I have been liking to switch it up. Well Lightning Bug has the BEST variety I have found of any similar app and trust me I have tried almost all of them on both Android and iOS. The sound quality is superb and you have the ability to pic and choose individual sounds from each scenario. I really enjoy this app and it is definitely worth the purchase!!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It was so heartfelt and well crafted. Would watch it with my nieces and nephews and they all love this movie as well. The comedy that the characters bring into this film is just a great addition. Would highly recommend it.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show! This is one of the few shows on the SyFy channel that the family all liked to watch.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great series but very violent.Very graphic. Other than that it is very addictive. Bet you can't watch just one episode.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it,  brain challenging and amusing game<br />recommending to have more challenging levels, also to have clear instruction to beginners.
B004TI5N38|4.0|As usual, the character development is superior, Plot line is well thought through with many twists and turns. Best of all, he picks believable locations for the action.
B001U1E28Y|5.0|Required reading for my grandson. I have re-read it along with him. This gives you a complete picture of the desperation so many people went through during the Depression and Dust Bowl era.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into picking up this book. It is a mix of inspiring true stories of personal triumph and anthropological information. I will never run or think about running in the same way. Thank you for changing my perspective!
0062073486|5.0|This is a goood read. The really good thing about her books is that they are just good old fashioned mystery stories that are challenging to figure out who-did-it without the graphic violence and sex that we get with modern day books. I have most of her books and I have read them so many times that I am starting to have to replace them, which is what this is.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|One of my favorite Disney movies that I get to share with my kids now!  My husband and I quote this movie to each other all the time!  &#34;you...very pretty&#34;..... &#34;smash it with a hammer!!!!!&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I sat down for a whole day and played this game. No wonder it was fun! I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to kill time.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This show makes you want to live in candle form or lark rise which I feel is the sign of a good show. The characters have depth and personality. Wonderful
B009FZHYKU|5.0|best zombie show ever! not as good as season one but still REALLY GREAT show!!! can't wait until season 4!!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This might be a ripoff of the game Can you escape which is the exact same but a little different. But can you escape might be a ripoff of this... Anyways both games are fun and you should definitely try them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love the acting, the costumes and the story line! hope it continues for many more seasons. Maggie Smith is a superb actressw, love her facial expressions!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I enjoyed this. Reminded me of the Lord of the Flies (which I did not like), but a lot better.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Enjoy the thinking needed to play this game. Simple concept, but challenging. My daughter showed me this game on her phone...lucky to have it for my kindle.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The future confederate style, South outlaw mentality, but enough fun to want you to see the next episode. I recommend it. Won't appeal to your intellectual side but it is a easy fun show after a days work
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had so much fun using this app. it was a great mental workout and was pretty interesting. the only problem I had was that they only had the first ten floors done when I used it so I finished in an hour or so.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this classic from the 80's. Sean Astin the leader of the Goonies will take you on a magic treasure hunt for one eyed willys treasure.<br />Goonies never Die.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Good movie. Outstanding performance. The characters, landscapes and  narrative. I love it. I will recommend it, especially to everyone. Kids will love it.
B001QE9WEO|3.0|The movie is far more kid friendly than the original. That being said, it's still enjoyable in its own way. The score isn't as I remembered it. Sounds pretty terrible. Other than that can't really complain.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|&#34;Hannibal &#34; is truly well written (under stated) and the actors bring iconic characters to life in a brand new way. You won't find an Anthony Hopkins version of Thomas Harris'  Dr Hannibal Lector here. The same can be said of Will Graham. His &#34;gift&#34; is embellished and reinvented.  It's a very compelling and engaging show. I recommend it highly with only one reservation. It's time slot was Thursday nights on NBC at 9PM and it's delightfully over the top with gore. If I was a parent of young and/or youngish child(ren). I would record it and watch it when all the kiddos are sleeping or gone from my home. I would still definitely watch it. It's has the same quality of an HBO or SHOWTIME original series.  &#34;Hannibal&#34; puts NBC squarely on the map in competition with shows like &#34;Dexter&#34;, &#34;Nurse Jackie&#34; and &#34;Treme&#34; (to name only 3).  Look for &#34;Hannibal&#34; and it's creators, producers, actors etc to be nominated and to win at this year's Emmy's
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Definitely consider reading. This is my favorite book of all time. There are many life lessons to be learned, and Charlie is someone to learn them from. He is one of the most genuine and poignant characters to come out of literature in a very long time. 5 stars
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|I have few perfect movies in my collection and this is one of the rare ones. Probably due to the fact that I grew up during the time period in question (1973.) The story revolves around a young teenager's passion for music and writing and the behind-the-scenes dynamics of his family. His dreams finally materialize when he's given a chance to interview Black Sabbath. It's from that point the story unfolds in all its 70's splendor. Cameron Crowe's writing and directing was near flawless. Kate Hudson made for a memorable Penny Lane, Phillip Seymour Hoffman hit it out-of-the-park as Lester Bangs, Patrick Fugit brought the right amount of naivity as William Miller, and Frances MacDormand totally owned the role as William's strict analytical but loving mother Elaine. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee as members of Stillwater nailed it as rockers (and believe me, I interviewed my share in the late 70's.) Although now divorced, Mr. Crowe's then wife, Nancy Wilson, helped with the musical score, which makes me one degree from Cameron. In 1978, I sat in on our station's interview with Heart. The album &#34;Dog and Butterfly&#34; had just come out. I remember Nancy being so out-of-it that all she could do was chortle in that high-pitched laugh of hers.<br /><br />It invoked a lot of nostalgia on my part because I identified with Patrick Fugit's character growing up. It was all about the music. Been radio for 36 years, met the groups, partied back stage, hung out with the groupies, and conversed with the writers. I'm not going to get into color saturation and sound so I can drive home a point here - I was so immersed in the movie that it didn't matter. Could care less. Most movies out of Hollyweird these days invest more in the &#34;look&#34; of the movie instead of a well-crafted script. If you suffer from the same rock 'n roll period memories as I do, it's a must.
B0052FG750|4.0|A tremendous collection that shows the consistently excellent musical artistry of the Doors, so often overlooked in the media hype over Morrison.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is currently the best Google Reader replacement out right now, plus Feedly Cloud now makes it a lot better.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is really fun. There are so many combinations to do with the makeup and outfits. Especially if you get the full version. It is very worth it. This is my favorite game out of them all
B007HACDLK|4.0|One of the great characters of all times. Could of had a little more of Mitch in the novel, but overall a great read. I always look forward to Flynn's books. I am glad he is back in good health and can continue to write.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|i love this movie. all the actors are epically awesome in their roles of slave drivers. leo, don johnson and the dude from inglorious bastards were great
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As always,Jack is a fun character.  However, the final scenes in the hanger was a little tedious. It also seemed to end rather abruptly.  I look forward to his next adventure.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I haven't played it much as I can't get the hang of what to do.  Maybe a better explanation of the directions would help.  I was in a hurry to try it!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I am not normally a fan of any MTV shows, and I can't say exactly why I chose to Binge watch this show.....but it was awesome! I finished the first season and couldn't wait to watch the second...so I did ...at Work! Gotta love technology!
B00006RIO7|5.0|My daughter's favorite movie. She loves it. I would buy another copy for anyone who likes this musical and as a gift.
0743490304|5.0|I have really liked reading all the Dan Brown books.  His writing always keeps my interest from beginning to end.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using LastPass for two weeks now and I'm very impressed.  As identity theft, impersonation, and account hijacking are becoming more of a threat daily, a product like LastPass gives a new hope for a more secure world. I'm writing this review in the hope of convincing more people to adopt a tool like LastPass.<br /><br />LastPass provides a solution to the password management challenge, a seemingly conflicting objective: how can a user who has dozens of accounts on many web sites, and multiple devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, smart-phone, at work and at home), keep passwords both 1) highly secure and yet 2) very easy to use?<br /><br />The first goal requires each of us to have non-guessable, very long and random passwords which are different for each site we need to login to. The second goal means not having to remember them all (impossible without a system that helps you do so).  LastPass \\"the last password you'll have to remember\\" does it by introducing one master password which is then used to strongly encrypt all your sites, URLs, passwords, common form-fill contents and more.<br /><br />While most modern browsers already have support for a master password to encrypt passwords stored on disk, they do not support syncing across devices, not even across multiple browsers on the same device (which LastPass does) and their encryption is not strong enough.  LastPass supports AES256 with PBKDF2. This means your identity + master password are not only used to strongly encrypt the sensitive content, but also do it in a way that strengthens it (using multiple encryption rounds, default is 5000). The resulting encrypted blob is meaningless even to LastPass (the company) itself, and would probably take millions of years of computing power to brute-force (try all possibilities) in order to break the encryption.<br /><br />Of paramount importance: all LastPass encryption and decryption of your secrets is done locally on your computer/device and never travels overthe network, not even over secure-web (SSL). Only the strongly encrypted contents get sent to LastPass servers for storage and syncing across devices.<br /><br />What if some black-hat managed to compromise the LastPass site or databases?  You can sleep well.  In fact you could even publish your encrypted vault on a public site. The strongly-encrypted data is meaningless, and your master password is not known or stored in any way on the mother-ship.<br /><br />What if a three-letter government agency were to order LastPass to give them your data? Same answer applies:<br />LastPass doesn't have your master password, only you do, and without it, the encrypted data is practically useless.<br /><br />One of the biggest advantages of LastPass over other similar solutions is its portability: it works on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac OS-X, Linux, Android, iOS, blackberry, and more.  It also has credentials import facility for a very large number of existing systems, so it is very easy to start using it on any new computer, without having to re-input a large number of web credentials.<br /><br />What if someone managed to figure out your master password?  LastPass has an answer to that too: once you enable two-factor authentication, you can limit use of your credentials to only certain devices, countries, keys, and/or additional shared-secrets so your strongly-encrypted \\"vault\\" of secrets, is useless to attackers even if they somehow manage to guess your master password unless they can lay their hands on your device (or other second factor) too. In the event that your master password is compromised, it is trivial to change it and re-encrypt the whole vault of credentials and secrets.<br /><br />LastPass supports auto-generation of long random passwords: you can control length, types of characters, and more.  It supports auto-fill of various forms and auto-logins to sites and many more features so your whole internet experience becomes much smoother. When youlogin to a new site for the 1st time, LastPass immediately offers to save the new credentials for future use and any device. The result is a big time saver when logging into different sites from different devices.<br /><br />LastPass provides a security challenge you may take, which can reveal weaknesses: do you use the same password on multiple sites?  How strong is each and every one of your passwords, etc. so you can fix things and become even more secure with time.<br /><br />LastPast is not perfect. I've seen cases where it misidentifies form-fields when trying to guess user/password for a new site.  The mobile experience is a bit unintuitive at first: I had to use the LastPass app to establish credentials before using a browser. The number of options is large and may be a bit intimidating for non technical users.  It does however come very close to perfection in solving the password challenge as presented above and covering all bases in my view, so I feel comfortable to rate it 5-stars.<br /><br />There's more to LastPass than I covered here, but the above is the gist of it.  After two weeks of use, I can't possibly imagine my online life without LastPass. It even helps me sleep better knowing that my new password lifestyle, makes me safer online.  I believe if everyone were to adopt a tool like LastPass, it would make the whole world much more secure.

0061765236|2.0|I am not one to stop 1/2 way through a book but considered it many times with this one.  In the end I finished it, though I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />SPOLIER ALERT:<br /><br />Did Emily have an aversion to sex because she was molested or because she felt the relationship with Chris was incestuous?  And if she felt it was in fact incestuous why did she have the reaction she did when he took up with someone else?  And, if she loved him so much why didn't she think of the consequences of having him involved with her death?  Just all over awful...
B0095P31L6|4.0|Pretty good show my kid likes it hey it's not too bad it's got a little the adult humor. Plus anything with Johnny Depp is awesome
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|Yep, a pretty bad movie, but I thought it was actually so bad that it started to be fun.  If you want some brainless tripe, this is the movie for you.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good story nand plot developement.  great summer read.  Can't wait to ream more of the stoory and more titles from Howey.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's absolutely one of the best books I've EVER read! And that's a lot! Thank you for a great read.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|I downloaded the Mp3 of this albumn to replace the scratched up cd, which replaced the cassette, which replaced the LP I had of this longtime fave.  It just makes me free and happy every time I hear it.  The Documentary Channel did a fantastic bio on Dave Brubeck and his lovely family.  There is a CD of the bio.  Must see watching.
B005HEPN06|5.0|I am pleased to give Star Trek 5 stars! A show with good values what is unfortunately so rare now a days...<br />My husband and I quit cable tv and now we just watch what we love and Star Trek is always on top of our list!<br />Thanks Amazon!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series made me think and weep. That people can do this to children. Then again, look what some have to endure today. Let's take a lesson before we get that far
B004EBBPU0|5.0|Fine fine about The Lizard King and the best work of acting Val Kilmer ever did. Fine cast but Val Kilmer was the puppet master as Jim was in real life. I was in Graves Registration in The Army and don't believe Jim every diied but decided to live a quiet life.  Jim lived in a cave for a while where they aged cheese after he faked his own death. After that, the trail ends as his French friends covered his tracks. Until they open up his coffin and do a DNA on his body, I would agree he was dead. Elvis is dead based on what he ate as I ate heathier food, had a stroke and almost went Beyon The Horizon.
0989524116|5.0|\\"Another amazing story from Brandt Legg. The pace never slowed and the depths continued to enthrall. Cool stuff! Crazy characters and more twists than the last one. Can't wait to see how he tops it. Great read for all ages, perfect for summer.\\"
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|...And so it was. And this sharp collection is wonderful. If anything, the crystal clear Blue-ray renditions of Star Trek's early days was a jolt, which had me seeing episode progressions in a new light. I have most of the orange DVD set of the Kirk years.They were nice - 'fun'- but this New Millennium look provided a whole new element and appreciation of the early days and clues to what's ahead.<br /><br />This fine set's new Blu-ray presentation steals the show; in a way it highlights the (sorry, no dissing intended) naive scripting and sets, not to mention the go-go uniforms and hair do's; but they're okay, it shows the progression which led to The Next Generation and...<br /><br />What's next? 3D renditions? Actual Star Fleet true adventures? Explorations? Discoveries? The JJ Abrams movies are certainly part of the progress which's now 50 years+.<br /><br />I'm in my 70's and of all the TV I've seen (alot!), no series engaged me as far as all the Star Trek's have (all two of them, so far) both in concept and execution. Optimistic, idealistic, positively humanistic; all on a path to human-kind's best times: Future times. Thanks Gene Roddenberry and the long list of fine actors, designers, writers, directors, producers and crews who made the legend come alive so excitingly, so beautifully, so positively.<br /><br />Yes, I've signed up for the Blu-ray collection of Star Trek The New Generation when it's released. (The sign-up list is coming to Amazon! Soon? I hope so.)<br /><br />And when the another generation of Star Trek comes to be, I hope I'll enjoy that one too. And the next? That would be pushing it for me at my age; but Star Trek's proven the worth of dreaming, yes?<br /><br />Don't we all hope there will be many Star Trek series ahead? Well into even farther futures, maybe a future actually with star dates? Why not? I hope I'll be around to see them all. I can only imagine how good they'll be and the technologies which will convey them.<br /><br />Something to live for for sure.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|May require a certain sense of humor but these episodes are fantastic.  Can't get enough of Shaun and his antics.
1594204217|5.0|In \\"Cooked\\" Michael Pollan takes a look at the major processes that go into food preparation which he breaks into four categories - fire, water, air and earth.  As with other books by Pollan there is a deep message in the writing and an underlying goal of the author to revitalize the reader's interest in our historic food culture and the approachability of it at the individual level in modern society.  The book sets the stage in the introduction asking the question of why to cook.  He notes that the amount of time spent in the kitchen by people has declined dramatically in the last 50 years and how the argument of division of labour and time optimization might hold partially true- being totally removed from preparing what we consume to survive is much much more complicated than such simple economic logic.<br /><br />The book sets the stage by discussing the BBQ.  It is a perfect opening to reinforce the author's introductory criticims of modern food preparation as the social atmosphere defined by BBQs will always be an obvious reminder of the deeply social aspects of certain kinds of food preparation.  The author researches heavily and takes the reader with him through his journey of finding the authentic BBQ.  In reading the chapter i have a much larger where to eat next list...  But the author combines food journalism of BBQ today with a historical account of the roast in our history and discusses some fairly deep concepts about what makes us human.  The author introduces the idea that what makes us human is actually the ability to cook as by cooking we reduce the time and energy spent in digestion and allows for people to have evolved much larger brains that require economy of eating time.  Not a central thesis of the book by any means, just an illustration that the philosophy of the author and examples all weave together to bring purpose to the writing.<br /><br />The author then goes into water and boiling food.  This is less adventurous and seems slightly more introspective.  Cooking food by boiling it is a more recent human invention as its dependent on a vessel to boil the water in after one has discovered fire.  It is also a more domestic form of food preparation and as a result has more gender role connotations.  The atmosphere of the campfire is different from the atmosphere of the person preparing a stew.  Nonetheless the author discusses how all cultures boil food in various forms to both cook and improve flavour and at its core is a fairly common practice.  The chemistry of what happens is discussed and the lessons learnt in terms of process.  The author details how for himself the slow process of the food preparation filtered through to the family time enjoyed while talking and slowly eating the slow cooked meal.<br /><br />The author then moves into air and discusses baking.  Baking is a form of food preparation that was subcontracted out of the kitchen hundreds of years ago (compared to roasting and boiling for example).  The author gives himself the project of learning how to bake and starts in his home state of California.  It is really interesting and it makes me feel like i am bread deprived.  The science of breadmaking is really interesting and the industrial process of making the flour has the effect of reducing the nutritional content.  The process of recombining nutrients to the bland white breads in modern supermarkets is discussed and shown to be predominantly a failure in terms of achieving nutritional goals.  The author starts with a successful baking of a white flour sourdough and eventually works with original wholeweat cultures.  I read this chapter and want to try the bread as well as all the bakeries that went into shaping this chapter...<br /><br />The author finally moves into Earth which is really his description for allowing nature and microbiology to take its course on food.  In particular fermentation is detailed in two forms.  The first is through pickling and the author tries to make sauerkraut, kimchi, and various other pickled foods.  This seems the most straightforward to attempt at home as its a very slow process but the nuances are discussed and as with all forms of food preparation the author discusses there is an art to it given the science has its limits given the multitude of processes that are occuring.  The author then discusses the art of cheesemaking and discusses the health aspects of the cheesemaking process.  The author ends with a discussion of alcohol production and he attempts making beer.  Given the beer kits involved are slightly more ready made than kits for other forms of food preparation, the first try for beer seems to turn out quite successfully on a a relative basis.  The role of alcohol in social settings, its health contents and issues as well as its historic role througout civilization and consumption in the animal world is all discussed in a lively manner.<br /><br />I have always like Pollan's books.  They are entertaining and have humor.  Despite the lightheartedness of the writing the deeper message is one that should be considered.  Cooking doesnt have to be a chore and the spillover effects of moving from processed food to home cooked are countless.  For him with cooking - home atmosphere is better, nutrition is better, value for money is better and his experiences are better all the while his social fabric gets stronger.  Obviously the message isnt for everyone to prepare all aspects of their food intake but to shift the balance away from always buying prepared and trying to minimize time cooking is a questionable goal.  Despite not being active in the kitchen I feel more invigorated to try after reading this.  I learnt quite a bit as well as enjoyed the read.auerkraut, kimchi, and various other pickled foods.

B00CLZ48FA|5.0|My daughter and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it, we just didn't understand why they didn't keep the original witches names. Anyway it's a great movie that makes you smile in a time where you need to get away from the harsh reality of this world.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Awesome documentary. I have so much respect for Dave Grohl and after seeing this that respect has only increased. So many great artists in this. Must see!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|this movie is awesome! great twist on a classic tale while staying true to it. Great actors and costumes. if you like classic tales and a lot of imagination and action, you should love this. this movie wasn't made to win the academy award of best picture, keep that in mind. It was made for pure entertainment and that's exactly what it is. Well made and great characters. Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have adored Solitaire since I was a child &amp; I play as often as possible. Highly recommend this app! Love it on My Kindle HD!

B009471JQE|5.0|I really have nothing bad to say about any ZZ Top album, but this is the best one to come out since Eliminator. It was claimed that on Mescalero they gone back to their roots of a 3 man blues band, but in La Futura they have truely done just that. I cant get enough of listning to it, and it is a MUST have for any ZZ Top fan!
1400069289|5.0|This book is well researched and noted.  It does a fine job of explaining the science and social implications behind habits.  It causes the reader to carefully look at their own habits.  Certainly worth a read.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Would recommend to anyone!  Keeps the pacifier from instantly landing on the floor and bouncing around when baby lets go.  My baby is also able to get it back in her mouth sometimes on own!  Great product!  Only complaint is that it's harder to clean (obviously) than usual pacifier.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this book suspenseful all the way through.  (You can read a synopsis from other reviews.)  I thought the development of the story was unusual, and each time I thought I'd reached the climax of the book, the next page would reveal another whole aspect of the plot.  I liked the way the author gave us Andy (the attorney, the husband and the father) who stood by his son to the end of the book, and Laurie (the wife and mother) whose character eeked out an uncertainty.  Then there was Jacob (the son) whose character becomes so believeable with the dialog and actions typical of a 13-year old.  I also loved the way the court cases were woven into the book.  A page turner and a fun read.
1590171993|4.0|This tome makes one think that the author either lived through a very sad life, or was close to someone else who did. Stoner is thwarted repeatedly as he struggles to live a fulfilling life in accordance with his bedrock moral principles. He's always able to seek and find refuge in his intellectual pursuits, but is consistently bewildered by human experience. He does his best to negotiate his way through the tangled web of human relationships, but it's a complicated experience. His humble origins didn't  provide him with any of the crafty cynicism that might have come in handy, and ultimately he pays a high price for his life choices. This book is written with an aura of reverence for Stoner himself, and with a sensitivity that makes it clear that the author is no stranger to the dilemmas faced by his protagonist.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|J. Cole's first album was not great to me simply because it was rushed but his sophomore album Born Sinner is a instant classic, everything from the production, lyrics and beats are on point. This album has everything from uptempo to slowed down smooth lyrics. This is the album we fans have been waiting for......My fav song is Land of Sharks simply because I am a outkast fan and he raps over art of story telling beat from Aqemini.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Cole just showed everyone where hip hop is supposed to be! This album is a classic and is so far best one out in a few years.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Both of us are lifetime Wodehouse fans, and are glad to be able to re-watch the TV series at leisure.  The two actors are superb in bringing the characters to life.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed the character development and stories of family members woven together over time.  Great character development and the resilience of family love.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The acting in this film had actors that were hard to believe ...My college Son really liked it and went to see it three times with friends,so I geuss it's really a matter of taste<br />.I have noticed in some resent movies that it's more about getting one out there than it is to make it Great.Money does not have to play a high role in some movies if we believe the Actors !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots of action and tremendous imagery! I was breathtaking when I read about all the deaths an<br />who katniss needed in her life forever was Petra! I didn't think he could ever recover!
190776111X|1.0|I like erotica, and read quite a bit of it.  It's usually a fun mind escape.  But this novel is just a mish mosh of pornography with no redeeming factors. Poor writing, and no real plot.  I kept feeling like the author was throwing everything she had just to shock me.  Ugh.  Pass on this one.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was looking forward to actually downloading videos instead of using Wi-Fi since I'm going on the plane. After several attempts at downloading it onto my Kindle Fire, I gave up. Each time it said, &quot;Cannot be installed.&quot; Probably has potential but I'll never know. Hope it works for everyone else and that you don't encounter this issue!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, because you have to make the same connections that the game author made. There is just so much /to do in this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am obsessed with this app... when I play it on my iPod. $7 is really expensive for a simple game. Fun for my iPod since you can get the free version. I wish they would get the Lite for Kindle Fire. Otherwise the best game ever, thanks for inventing it !^&infin; (Exclamation mark to the power of infinity)
B0008ENHUI|5.0|My husband LOVES this movie! So glad I was able to find it for him. He watches it on a regular basis!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think that this was the best for me to read I think that it was a lot better than a regular chapter book<br />I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I am addicted.  Every episode is interesting.  There is never a dull moment. The suspense is ongoing in every episode.
1400069742|5.0|We look back over the nearly 70 years since World War II ended through a glass permanently tinted by the undeniable valor of the brave men and women who fought for the Allies.  The genuine heroism of the Greatest Generation has served to obscure some of the less inspiring details both of the war years and of the period immediately preceding them: the late 1930s and early 1940s, when the Fascist dictatorships in Europe and Asia first threatened and then launched all out war, overwhelming a huge area and leaving only one country, Great Britain, in active opposition to them for nearly two years.  Here in the United States our memories of that time period are dominated by terms like Arsenal of Democracy and Lend-Lease, but many details have been obscured.  Lynne Olson's magnificent history illuminates the years 1939-41 in the US, when debate and controversy over what role, if any, America should play in the conflict was being fought out, sometimes literally, across the country.<br /><br />Olson's subtitle refers to President Franklin Roosevelt and Colonel Charles Lindbergh as leaders of the debate over whether the US should go to war.  FDR is usually depicted as a brave and resolute figure whose political gifts enabled him to guide the nation into and through the conflict.  Olson shows him as a tired and somewhat disillusioned figure who preferred to let events take their course without active interference from him, who sometimes had to be prodded to take necessary actions, and who often underestimated his popular support and the willingness of the American people to go through great trials.  Lindbergh is usually remembered as a puzzling figure, who used his status as a popular hero to advocate non-interference with totalitarian regimes.  Olson paints a fuller picture, showing Lindbergh to be an intelligent man so wounded by family tragedy that he grew cynical about the ability of democratic governments to govern successfully while being successfully \\"brainwashed\\" by the Nazis into believing that they represented a future that it was hopeless to struggle against.<br /><br />While Roosevelt and Lindbergh are major characters in Those Angry Days, there are many more important players: politicians, industrialists, journalists, intellectuals, movie producers, and others.  Olson does a masterful job of recreating the confusion over what, if anything, should be done by the US to assist Great Britain and later the Soviet Union against the Nazis. She has a wonderful writing style that flows smoothly and a keen eye for a telling anecdote.  In these chapters we not only get a full picture of how the US moved towards war as well as how the groundwork was laid for much of what was to unfold in the post war years, like McCarthyism.  The story ends with Pearl Harbor and the US declaration of war in December, 1941, with a final chapter summing up the eventual fates of many of the major characters.<br /><br />Those Angry Days demonstrates that Lynne Olson can write American history as masterfully as  the British events she covered so well in Angry Young Men and Citizens of London.  If the picture she paints of a country that was confused and reluctant to go to war until it was forced upon it does not always square with the legends that have grown up around World War II, it is nonetheless a commendable one that does nothing to obscure the undoubted heroism and determination of  a people who didn't want to go to war but were determined to win once war was forced upon them.e Nazis into believing that they represented a future that it was hopeless to struggle against.<br /><br />While Roosevelt and Lindbergh are major characters in Those Angry Days, there are many more important players: politicians, industrialists, journalists, intellectuals, movie producers, and others.

B00D6BN9NK|2.0|The story is thin. The kid does not look like his dad. Willis is still cool. But still want my two hours back.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!! An undated throwback to &#34;the old days&#34;.<br />ALL OMD fans will be thrilled!<br />A MUST for all OMD collectors!
B008Y768XO|4.0|Great great movie!!! If it wasn't so sad I would have given this 5 stars. It was a wonderful lesson in loyalty.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you've read the first two, this will not disappoint. This particular volume is filled with twists and turns all over, needless to say.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|Great movie, one of the best horror movies ever done.  This movie still scares people to this day!  Well written, acted, and the special effects were ahead of its time.  Worth having in your movie collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wish there were more shows on television that had suspense, elegance, and class. This has been so wonderful to watch.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Was not consistent with the book &#34;The Hobbit&#34;.  Although action packed it was not much different or as interesting as previous Hobbit series movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is amazing. I am so sick and tired of network television that crass and vulgar, I can't wait for season 4. I just hope the writers do not ruin this series by forgetting that people love the elegance and class.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|I've seen Led Zepplin live and this is a very accurate rendition of the concert that I saw.  Sound quality was great as well as the video captures.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This is a very good movie if you like thrillers - and who doesn't.  The story is well written and all parts were very well acted.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|People who love CSI, NCIS and all of those other procedurals should skip Hannibal. There is real depth to the plot and characters. The acting is superb and the visuals are beautiful. Network tv is bad right now. NBC is bad right now. Hannibal is the exception. If you like it, make sure to watch when they roll out season 2 or there probably will not be a season 3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have had My Horse for awhile and i think i will have this a really long time. Anyways i think the horses should be less expensive actually everything should be less expensive. I love this though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the first tablet game to draw me in. I played for hours, which is really unheard of for me! Great game.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I love all of John Green 's books. He has a great sense of humor when it comes to telling a story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addicting in the best way - proving that excellent character development and great script writing is more<br />compelling that the watered down shows we're handed each season by network executives. Bravo BBC!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My son loves Legos,he also loves all of the Lego games.This movie was one of his favorites, he loved the way it followed the game. He said it helped to play the game on some levels that he'd had difficulties with.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Pros: It's backed by Amazon, so customer service is paramount.  It has great color quality.  The sound is good, too.  Its memory is respectable, and you can save what you've finished or will read later in the cloud, anyway. I found most of the controls to be pretty intuitive, which makes operating it easy.<br /><br />Cons: The war between Amazon and Google over apps doesn't benefit the consumer in any way.  They need to get over it.  The battery life isn't bad, but I would prefer a little more.  I would prefer it to come with a cover and stand, but I'm okay that it doesn't.  My biggest beef is the camera function.  It has a single lens, which makes using it to take pictures nearly worthless, although it does function well in video calling.<br /><br />It's quite good, but there's room for improvement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|On a scale of one to ten fifty billion. this is the best app you can get I have it on my kindle fire,xbox, and Pc.its freaking epic.
6304711891|5.0|Purchased for son.  He says it meets and exceeds expectations.  Plays without a hitch.  Purchase made to update library as already had it on VHS.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Go through tons of adventures with this neat game!<br />The thing  with this game is patience though. But, great game!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is refreshing, and I do not find that it contradicts my religion. Instead, it gives me greater appreciation for the true tenants of that religion, which is to love your creator, others, and above all yourself.  I agree, without self love, there is nothing to share.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Circle of Life.  Lion King said it better with better acting and more enjoyable story.  Hakuna Matata is a much better way to consider the big issues.
B00BESCJII|5.0|The characters all come alive beautifully. No surprise, since the novelist is also the director. Watch it with your kids just entering high school. It's important for all of us at any age to learn tolerance and kindness.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun could b easier to get coins to buy stages and not cost as much<br />Then it would b a 5 star game
B008645YXA|5.0|Bought this and Billion Dollar Babies from the same seller, awesome, no issues and very prompt service. CD's were sold new, and it's cool jamming out to some old stuff. Brings back some memories.
0448444216|5.0|My grandson loves this book because it has pictures of all the familiar farm animals and he can practice making the noise each animal makes.  Each picture of a farm animal has a pesky fly somewhere on the page that he likes to find and point out.  It is easy for the adult to turn the pages - revealing the mini page about the spider on each page makes the next page &#34;pop&#34; to turn.  I will say that he doesn't spend too much time on the spider's activities on each page as it is pretty much the same thing until the last page and becomes boring with the repetition.<br /><br />This book is preferred over about 10 other books we read to him and quickly replaced &#34;The Very Hungry Caterpillar,&#34; also an excellent book by Eric Carle, as his favorite.  I wish this was a board book as they hold up better than the paper editions.
0064400557|5.0|I bought this for my 7 1/2 yr old granddaughter because she wanted to read &#34;books with chapters.&#34; She loved it, besides every child should read charlotte's web!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I have laughed my butt off the entire time I have been playing it. The kids love it and I will definitely suggest this game to others
B00D8WMASM|5.0|Album was worth downloading if your not a J cole fan is not for you. Plenty of good songs I regret not downloading the delux version.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|I loved this book by Nicholas Sparks.  And the movie was also great!  It stayed true to the book while still condensing the story for the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Couldn't wait for the next episode.  I found this series on par with others I have seen on PBS such as<br />Upstairs Downstairs.
0307951154|4.0|Excellent sense of place and strong and complex characters, but if you like an ending tied up neatly and if you're fond of justice being done, then this might not be the best choice for you.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An amazing recollection of what war is really like when governed by people in Washington who have little knowledge of what it's like to be there in the flesh fighting.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|You have to see this movie. Not a chick flick ! Will laugh and watch it over and over.  Adult humor, but will go above most kids heads.  Very little profanity,  but still a great movie.
0670026557|2.0|As an otherish giver, I wanted to give something to others who may be considering buying this book.  If you've got time and/or money to burn, it may be a good investment.  If not, go to author Adam Grant's video on YouTube and you'll get the message in 6 minutes rather than that many hours (not quite sure what the cards have to do with anything).  For a guy who professes that givers use mostly third person terms like 'we' and 'our' and takers use first person terms like 'I' and 'my', he sure talks a lot about himself in the first person 'I sold the largest contract in the history of the company' and 'I was a diving champion and all American diver' at Harvard (he does mention that he went to Harvard a lot).  Some good lessons here, but not worthy of an entire book.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Sometimes they say &#34;bad words&#34;, but the acting is excellent.  Moreover, the fashion and hairdos for the women, as well as the men, are appropriate.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Let's me read the Word everywhere I go! Awesome app. But when I try to edit my notes after its been saved, It Doesn't open up.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I have used this app 5 times now. I found it relatively easy to use upload and use. There was very little set up (less than 5 easy to read sections or drop down boxes) and it works has advertised. So far it has NOT crashed once. I do wish it had a couple of more features YMMV.
6305212112|5.0|I ALWAYS catch this movie on REALLY early in the morning when I can't sleep &, of course, I stay up to watch it.  I HAD to own it so I ordered it & it arrived very fast.  I love it!!  One of the best movies of all time!!
B00783NWB6|5.0|this movie is already great to begin with why would you not get in Blu-ray 3D this is awesome if you like a lot of action my dad LOVES IT!!!!!!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Clearly this movies was made for it's 3D effects only.  No story...Do not rent it...it's bad!  Very disappointed in Disney.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|This movie is awesome!!! I got this for my daughter and she loved it why not get it??<br />you'll love it
1423140605|5.0|This was a great read and left me hanging.  I would wait until October to read it so that you are not left with a long term cliff hanger.  The ending is intense and lacks sufficient closure, almost like the series is not finished.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Extremely well done. One of the best sci fi shows available. Forces you to think about what goes on around you
1423136802|5.0|I love the books in this series.  It is fun and enjoyable to read and got my kids to read enough to earn awards in school.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Love the ending, and got to love the car flying over someones head in the action scene they really made a car go over someones head what a screen shot of that no clue how they did that, and like the fact that Arnold did his own stunts in the movie too just the other day I was thinking how come he doest make a movie when it counts just cause he's old he doesn't do movies and then a new blue ray came out.
B009VYF5E2|3.0|I would never give MERLIN less than a 5 star rating (haven't yet until today), but the quality of the entire Season 4 DVD pack has changed this.  Freezing up on every disc in the package.  Sound of voices doesn't match the actors movements in their mouths, skips 2-30 seconds into the next scenes.  This constantly happens throughout the entire disc.  All the discs in this package I received do this.  I have returned this item.  I'm going to get another Series 4 and pray I can give MERLIN the 5 star review  it deserves.  As far as the show itself, Merlin is 5 stars hands down.  Episodes 1 and 2 are brilliant.  Episode 3 is the moment all us Merlin fans have been waiting for. Bradley James and Colin Morgan were exceptional.  Episode 4 is for all you dragon lovers.  Episode 9 is for all you Lancelot lovers.  Episode 13 (finale')is the best of the series.  Colin is at his peak when it comes to acting and Bradley adds so much to this show.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|THE SMALL YELLOW GUYS ARE THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE--AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SECOND MOVIE<br />COMING OUT JULY 3
159463176X|5.0|This book differs from the author's earlier books so bear that in mind.  It's basically less a novel than a collection of overlapping and interwoven \\"slice of life\\" type short stories. The opening story about the sister, Pari, who is sold and the brother who misses her does reach resolution at the end but it's not the driving force of the narrative. It took me a little while to get the gist of jumps in time and new character introductions, but if you just go along and don't try too hard you will be drawn in (at least I was - and the story still stays with me a week after finishing it.) It's an insight into lives that are very different from mine, an exploration of family and love and loss, of the complexity of human relationships.  I really enjoyed it.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This book is not for the faint hearted...  The subject matter was challenging however, the writing and story were superb....
B00881VLCE|5.0|Would have been great, but my phone couldn't handle it. A lot of puzzles to choose from. And different levels of puzzle. From easy with a few pieces to 1000 pc. Great game to keep your mind sharp.
0425263991|5.0|With such a mystery summary I had no idea what to expect when I cracked this story open.  I was certainly not expecting a story about Kaleb Krychek when I started this; however, as soon as I realized this was his story, I was ready to stay up until 4 am to finish it in a sitting.  Unfortunately I decided being awake for work was slightly more important (not much).<br /><br />Let me start of by saying...that I freaking loved this.  Nalini Singh has never disappointed me and Heart of Obsidian skyrocketed to being in my top three favorite psy-changeling books.  (The others being Kiss of Snow and Caressed by Ice respectively)<br /><br />Where to even begin?  Nalini has such a fascinating world.  I really wish I could live in it.  The psy race, their powers/designations, the changelings, the politics, everything is so intricate and well put together.<br /><br />Kaleb Krychek.  Oh my.  Dark, incredibly dangerous, sexy, damaged, he was an incredibly powerful main character.  He was both good and evil, did such brave heroic things, and such terrible things and could be both terrifying and then be down to Earth.  He was so complicated and to see such a character that walked in both the dark and the light to achieve his goals was both new and exciting.  His story was straight fabulous.  His story so sad that knowing the changelings ripped Enrique to shreds already was not enough.  Not at all.<br /><br />Sahara was a lovely counter balance.  After all she had been through to still be morally sound and so vibrant...she was a great match for Kaleb.  She didn't have a singular moment that made me unhappy (which is a rare occurence.)  She was a beautiful, strong and all around great character with very interesting abilities.<br /><br />The story.  Wow.  We get sooo many answers that we had been asking throughout the series.  <spoiler>I about flipped when we got the identity of the Ghost~!</spoiler>  We see a new era unfolding and I can't wait to see what's in store.  Hopefully a story with Vasic or Aden?  Especially Vasic.  He seems so alone and ready to die.  He needs a spark of life.  Their love story is just...to quote Speed Racer here, beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be.<br /><br />The writing.  Nalini's writing is so smooth to read.  Though her favorite word may be splintered - haha.  Her descriptions are so incredible and the sex scenes.  Oho my.  They were hot, tense and just...amazingly perfect.<br /><br />I need moar.  I am so excited to see what happens in the world now.  I ripped through this book (why do you have to exist work~!  I could have finished this sooner~!  Though I suppose I got to savor it's epic-ness longer.) and seriously.  I need moar.<br /><br />I will be rereading this.  Multiple times.  Why?  Because it is SO incredibly awesome-sauce.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Interesting plot, but the details were strange. The book told me almost nothing about Paylor, and for a while I had no idea about the setting. This book hard a fabulous plot, though, that always kept you on your toes.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I enjoy his books, whether it be with Mickey Haller or Harry Bosch-both are truly entertaining. I enjoy the details in settings as well as characters. Harry is always getting in trouble but it is fun to see how he prevails in the end.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I do realize this movie is rated R.  I did not think it would contain the F word, finding out while watching the movie with my teen granddaughter.  Can someone tell me how this added anything to the movie??  For me, it only ruined it.

B005HSL626|1.0|Grandson thought he wanted this, but found he had no interest in playing it. We uninstalled it from the Kindle to find a better game.
B003SI605K|5.0|What a beautiful story about four mom's and their daughters.  I would recommend it to my friends for sure. Thanks!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Grandson likes the game to have something different when he is here. It seems to be ok for a child to have to play.

B009KY5OGC|5.0|read this book if you watched westerns as a kid. This book is a real eye opener to how America stole from the Indians who were here before us.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|This is not the sort of book I would normally read, but it was recommended by my sister-in-law so I thought I would give it a go.  Almost from the first chapter I was hooked.  A fantasy that's not a fantasy.  You get to really believe in vampires, witches and daemons.  Not sure I would have been as brave as Diana but ...  A fantastic read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter had this game on her ipad and I enjoyed playing it! Lots of fun so I downloaded it to my Kindle.
0061438294|5.0|It's one of the best mass market books on nonverbal communication, or at least one of my favorite, and I've read a lot. Word to the wise on people who are interested in NLP, Nonverbal communication, and social engineering: never depend on one book to be a source of learning. Go to workshops, watch youtube videos, read articles, hell, buy a cop who has the time a cup of coffee and have a conversation, and buy more books!<br /><br />Also, identify, to yourself, why you want to learn more about this subject. Myself , for example: negotiations and office politics.
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's writing is so vivid and realistic that you feel every pebble on the trail. As I read the book I walked around feeling this unbelievably heavy pack on my back. I looked at my feet several times a day imagining the pain and suffering endured by Cheryl. You rejoice in the trail cameraderie and despair when all looks hopeless. The flashbacks put this endurance test into the proper perspective and are both entertaining and heart rending. A must read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book gives you a straight view into heavy combat. The author comes across as honest and credible. Blunt description of operations, combat and killing makes the book valuable in terms of knowledge about front line warriors and the psychology that goes along with it.
0316172324|4.0|It is a provocative book on the power of thinking and reasoning. It is a very enjoyable and thought-provoking read.

B005DJREGQ|5.0|Good for the family to watch. Funny a must have in your collection.  The characters are well played.  Can't say much more.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A cautionary tail of how dis-economies of scale overwhelms IT in most businesses. The way forward is simple and fast, yet does not fit with vendor-led silver bullets beloved by managers who wish to jump straight to economy of scale.<br />If you do not understand what this book explains, any change to your IT function can be a random turn for the worse. Will Agile, for example, make your IT people more client-focussed? Or will it result in an implementation backlog with higher error rates? Both are possible.<br />If you can only read one book on IT management, this is IT ;-)

B003DT19F0|3.0|My 3 year old granddaughter didn't seem to like it as well as I thought she would.  She watched the first few minutes of the movie, and seem to enjoy it but then decided to go play with her toys.  To be fair, that is pretty typical for most movies except the Disney Tangle movie, Princes Sofia and most things princes related.  I'm hoping she'll eventually get through the &#34;Princes&#34; phase at some point and enjoy the Tinker Bell movies I got for her.

B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books, and I think everyone's aware that the last few have lost a little bit of their steam. This book is like a return to the first few. While it has last-book rapid-wrap-up syndrome (Eric's storyline is particularly fast), it also has great pay off to long time readers. You see a bevy of old characters come back, mentions of long-forgotten plot points, and Sookie gets a great ending. I really, really enjoyed the final installment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I though the original Temple Run was okay,  but this one is AMAZING ! It has so many more features but the same main goal as the other one . Some people say &quot;I hate it, it's so hard .&quot; It's not hard ... it's just different . Works well on Kindle Fire . I recommend getting it ... and if you're part if the minority that doesn't like it ... it's free ! So just get it and have fun :)
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The story opens in a British retirement home for opera singers and musicians.  Here we meet the genial, still active residents who are happily rehearsing for an upcoming gala.  A new guest is moving  in today, and there are mixed feelings when it turns out to be a famous diva (and unfaithful ex of one of the residents).<br /><br />This is a lovely, sweet - but not too sweet - comedy staring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, and Pauline Collins and directed by Dustin Hoffman.  The cast is uniformly excellent (although Courtenay looks too young to be paired with Smith).  The setting, a beautiful manor house in the countryside, is exquisite.  The story deals with life and death, frailty, love, and hate and does so gently and honestly.<br /><br />Recommended for those who enjoy classical music and quiet, character-driven movies.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Really enjoyed this one.<br />Actually watched it twice and equally enjoyed it both times.<br />Starts out a bit slow, but stay with it.

B008JFUPOY|5.0|Monsters University brings everything you expect from a Pixar film: well written and lovable characters, a great sense of humor, and an original and well told story filled with great messages and morals. Where MU differs from the rest of the pack is that it brings these elements all together in such a way the proves to he irresistibly charming and incredibly funny, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face throughout the entirety of the film.<br /><br />With Monsters University, I can finally say that the Pixar drought is over!<br /><br />MU tells a prequel story, one that didn't seem necessary at first glance. I was excited, but hesitantly so. Regardless of the reception, I knew that I was going to see it. After 2 years without a Pixar film (would not see cars 2 or brave), I couldn't stand it any longer. After all, Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar film! Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I need to say one thing: Monsters University is the funniest Pixar film to date. I was rolling in my seat with laughter at points, but unlike most Pixar humor it wasn't only the slapstick or the funny facial expressions that struck my funny bone, it was the way that Pixar nailed the college experience on the head. Fresh off the college train, it was equal parts amusing and wonderfully nostalgic to see Pixar's \\"college movie\\", which was pleasantly free of vulgar language or overt sexuality; it was simply a purely funny and charming world and story the whole way through.<br /><br />In some ways, MU had to have been the hardest film to make for Pixar. Since the genre relies so heavily on garbage humor, Pixar had to constantly think outside of the box to deliver both a funny and ingenious tale while avoiding everything that the genre has become known for in Hollywood, and Pixar brings its A game. Sure, a couple of jokes fall flat and are there purely for children's enjoyment, but just about every bit of humor is in here for people in college and beyond, and I applaud Monsters University for being so slyly mature and funny for an older audience.<br /><br />But it's just not the humor that rocks in MU, the story is true and heartfelt. Mike is going to school to learn how to become a scarer, where he meets a young, inexperienced, and egotistical Sully. It's an interesting dynamic that totally works, one that I honestly didn't see coming. The characters are all well written and have great development, neither rushed or forced.<br /><br />It's also relieving to see tons of brand new characters and how they develop Mike and Sully's relationship, all of whom are charming and unique. The story is filled with great messages for moviegoers of all ages, too. I also really felt for Mike and his striving towards academic success; his story resonated so much with me. My theater was cheering at points, and at others the tension was thick in the air. That's only happened in a select few other films, but not once in an animated film, which proves one thing: I wasn't the only one in love with these characters on the big screen! After an interesting and amusing series of events, Mike and Sully are forced to work together in the Scare Games to prove that they are more than just a pretty face.<br /><br />The third act takes an interesting and creative turn, one that was equal parts surprising and conclusive. Even if MU lacks that freight train pacing and a \\"Boo\\" character to keep tensions high and the plot moving progressively forward, I think having that same dynamic would've made MU too safe and too similar. And that is what I found the most delightful about MU's story: it was original. It didn't rely on Monsters Inc. for cannon; the story totally works on its own, which is the most commendable quality of MU. Prequels usually fall into the same formula and rely on its brand to sell. MU can stand alone an apart from INC, or right alongside of it, and that's my biggest compliment for MU.<br /><br />And once again Pixar Has utilized their beautiful RENDERMAN technology to bring the world of MU to life, with gorgeous CGI and believable characters. Presented in Sony Digital 4K, MU pops off the screen. The music by Randy Newman is quite fantastic; drum lines permeate an otherwise typical score, giving the music a unique feeling. I did miss the unique swing/jazz styles of INC, but it was good to see that some of the tunes from the original worked their way, respectively complementing the action on screen, as a nice little nod to the adventures to come within Monsters Inc.<br /><br />So, am I a Monsters fan? You bet. And the premise of a prequel? I was hesitant. Not any longer.<br /><br />Charming, hysterically funny, and most of all well told, well written and relatable, Monsters University could've been the most disappointing cash in of the summer. Thank Oozma Kappa it wasn't!<br /><br />Final Score: 9/10r beautiful RENDERMAN technology to bring the world of MU to life, with gorgeous CGI and believable characters.

B001KWTBQQ|2.0|I thought this was a boring movie with obvious lines, minimal plot and graphics that were no better than the free shows online.  Of course, I didn't choose the movie, but this one exceeded my expectations - just in the wrong direction.  I couldn't even make myself sit through the entire thing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent source to enhance your vocabulary. The book is reach with words and grammar which improved my english. A must read.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This film stands the test of time, and is one of the enduring classic animes that everyone should see.  With social commentary, fantastic voice acting, and great animation, this film hits all the right notes.  Definitely worth owning.
B0042UEU8M|3.0|While it wasn't a &#34;bad&#34; movie, we found it the story line moved very slow and was rather boring. Wouldn't recommend this one.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a truly great yarn which I came to after seeing the first two seasons of the very well made HBO version. The book is miles better as it gives background, motivations, back stories, the protagonists' thoughts - and maps!! Although violence and sex feature, it is a lot less sexist than the HBO series, and less explicitly violent. Yet I don't mind having seen the series already: the novel helps make more sense of the plot and multiple characters and the actors' faces are in my head as I read.<br />There are some distinct Americanisms in the text, (although the author usually manages a more 'neutral' voice), which can jar a little; and I would like to point out that solid gold plate is an oxymoron. But these are quibbles.<br />All in all the novel is an imaginative, multi-faceted epic/fantasy/adventure experience, exciting and fun at the same time. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series as well. Wonderful.

B00BGIC4I6|3.0|First half of the movie is great and funny and very relatable.  It then falters and becomes cliche and pathetic and ultimately depressing.
B002XZOZQA|4.0|It is still a musical classic after all these years, and I enjoyed it again even after the many, many times that I have watched it.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|loved it! a great film, and very chilling. very interested to know if they will make a part 2 to this

B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great way for kids of all ages to use their imagination.<br />My 10 year old loves it and so do I.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is a movie that will be in my dvd collection. We can watch this over and over, and in a lot of ways wished this was a true story.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Having heard them before,I had to have this set...I am inspired by the blend,vocals,feel.<br />You will love this:) Best bang for your buck!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This movie was fair, only gave it 5 stars because we are Tim Burton fans. It was a typical family movie, and fun to watch
B0000844M8|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and it not only brings tears to your eyes- If you are a huge animal lover and activist like me, it will bring on full blown bouts of crying throughout with laughter and smiles in between no matter how many times you watch it.  I do believe that watching this movie as a child had a great deal of influence on my love, respect and need to protect animals as an adult. It may be an oldie now, but I think that all children should watch this endearing film of Elsa and her bond with Joy Adamson (and it wouldn't hurt for a few unsympathizing adults to watch it too)as I think it could have positive effects on them later in life.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great read.  It covers a wide span of time but weaves a compelling story of lives of the Afghan people both in Afghanistan and where many were forced to flee to get away from violence and uncertainty for their families future.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Love, love love this author and the way he makes me feel the characters, the situations of the people.  I think he is an amazing story teller and even now after weeks of finishing this book his characters are still alive to me.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|For Science Fiction the writers and producers have brought together a story worth telling with excitement and humor. It's time for another Stargate series!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The only thing I can say is I am so sad there are only three books written by this author.  He always takes me out of my world and transports me to another. This book I could not put down.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|Superior performances by a superior cast...can watch this over and over and enjoy it every time!!! We need more good wholesome entertainment just like this !!!
B001B7CNY2|5.0|Essential to have for those who love this kind of movies! a classic of the genre should not miss, the blu ray is a definite plus, even if the film is a little dated.<br />Excuse the translation but I am French and live as the U.S. and transatlantic friendships!!
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Was handed this book by a young friend and colleague who said I reminded her of Caitlin, or at least the way she writes.  I was terribly pleased to find myself laughing out loud to empty rooms and yes on the bus.  We all need to remember to laugh out loud, and often, and Caitlins style of writing is frank and to the point.  I loved both books and recommend them to anyone who appreciates that in all our serious lives, its love and laughter that keeps us going.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|I've never played this game before and although the graphics look crisp I was disappointed to see there was no tutorial or help section. I more or less just made moves hoping I was doing something right and I could never get past the first three moves. Very frustrating. Uninstalling is less hassle so I'll go that route.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Have always enjoyed adventure romance, love the way Cassandra has each characters' story entwined in the  series.  Addictive from the first book, and looking forward to beginning the next series. Thank you Cassandra for a thoroughly enjoyable set of books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to figure out how to hunt for all the tools to get to the door.  But you have to specifically it the right spot on some things.  So keep poking around when using the tools.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Changed my life for the better. Now I get it! Going wheat free has made a huge difference with my IBS.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|I didn't watch it -- changed my mind when I saw how long and unending it might drag on to be -- I might miss something more exciting
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love the mind games i play against my mom and we really enjoy it. seems like someone likes mind games and riddles as much as we
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I love this game its tons of fun but to get the best hair styles or the best anything including the characters I wish you could be at least two characters but other then that its a fun game
B00BI745AA|5.0|It was amazing, really enjoyed it. The cast chosen was great, Russell Crowe's voice wasn't the greatest, but he played his part well.
0812971825|3.0|The book was a bit more used than expected, but that is okay with me<br />Should be an interesting book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is awesome. Addicting and Fun but over too soon. More levels please! I especially love that there are no real directions....just escape.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story was well told and entertaining.  The characters were very believable.  Truly a great read!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|a real page turner - stop asking me to review things if I have to write the number of words you want...this is the last time....
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I say near perfect only because it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to put George R.R. Martin's book completely into film.  Something had to be left out.  Fortunatley, only minor details were sacrificed leaving the true essence of the story.  A perfect companion to the book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! My friends always had it, and I wanted it so bad! Now that I have the kindle fire, I play this all the time! My sister loves it too. Get this game...NOW!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the author did a fine job of writing.  I just did not enjoy the plot.  Personal choice mind you.  I am sure many others either loved it or will love it.  The first book was my favorite and I can't find fault with it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Like the hidden aspect to this game. Not hard so far, but a nice little diversion. Kids like it, too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did not like this as much as I liked thge first book.  The writing is fine and every bit as good as the first book.  I just felt the character development was going in a direction I personally did not want to see.  My personal choice.
B00005T30L|4.0|The character development is terrific in this film. The emotionless behavior throughout the film is hilarious. Enid's character shows symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. Not being able to carry a job, not getting along with others and changing identity (indian music to punk rock). Her character alone makes the film very entertaining. How she carelessly interacts with others is the best part. What I found to be relatable is how they act when school ends. They do not have any major goals or plans. They just wait to see what will happen.Their is that feeling of being lost and overwhelmed at the same time. It can be a dark experience. The lack of structure in Enid's life is what the film is about to me and how she prefers not to have it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5.  WOW!  True to Martin's previous 4 books in this series A Dance with Dragons keeps you reading and by the end you want more!  I can't hardly wait for Book 6 to come out!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|First of all, the price alone should cause people to pick this game up. Mix in the fact that it is Iron Man AND a solidly fun game to boot, and it is a no-brainer.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I bought this as I missed the first several episodes.  So glad I did.  Who knew this would be such a successful and entertaining series?
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Like he imagination of the series and the acting of the main character.  Was a very interesting series and enjoyed the acting of all the characters
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is exiting page turning book and the best trilogy ever !!!:)This is bound to be on the top ten books for the decade!!!!!!!!:) can't wait for the movie!!!!:)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is great. You can easily try out each sound with just a touch . I combine a few of them, put my kindle on my night table and go off to sleep.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|It is a pretty easy game for my 3 yr old child yet is very addicting. They let the animal patients in the waiting room, direct them to exam rooms/beds, and do different exams to fix the problems. Cute layout and characters.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Down to earth. Could use more realistic real life issues. Every day issues that effect us all. Have actors from east coast such as Boston.
0143122916|3.0|Interesting story but not well written. Opened my eyes to the sorry state of those prisoners in North Korea. Hopefully something can be done about their situation.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Worth every page!  And there were a LOT of pages! Done finally done woot!!! Great job finishing the story up right
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|For some reason it took me awhile to get around to reading Mockingjay.  After life and work getting in the way and then leaving my hard copy of this book on a plane, I finally read it on my Kindle.  It's a fantastic end to The Hunger Games series.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Great acting just like a  Hitchcock movie. My wife and I both loved it. Highly recommend to see it you will not be disappointed.
B008133MDK|5.0|So what came first? The BBC version of Sherlock or the version on CBS. True they are very different shows with the same Sherlock arrogance and learning sidekick. The BBC version is smart, well written, and not overly clouded with unneeded drama. For true Sherlock fans that have enjoyed the original books, these short miniseries like episodes are perfect. Also, you cannot beat the acting of a talented actor, who landed the role as the most hated villain in the new Star Trek movie. There was a reason why he was chosen. Enjoy!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Love the quality, fast shipping. 3rd movie not a great story..but I'm glad i finally bought the BR set. Prometheus I've already got.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Holy Cow. Started watching the TV show on a whim. I borrowed the first two season dvds. And I couldn't stop. At first when it was advertised on national TV it did seemed like another law drama. It looked like one of may episodic TV shows that I wouldn't be interested in. The series is like crack, I couldn't stop. I think I lost a few weekends of my life to the Good Wife. Not to be missed. Enjoy hours that you will lose from your life.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|this is my second copy as the first one disappeared.  I love all the song choices.  Great memories, well done, no meaningless fillers.  All good. The friends that watched it with me loved it , too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never taken so long to read a book as The Book Thief.  Maybe it was to savor the words as long as I could.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app it gives you the idea to think out side the box. U should get the app it's great.  Thx
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, entertaining app that is not too hard but still challenging. I enjoy the seeking of the clues and the different approaches needed to uncover them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a fun game. I can see why other's have said it was to short. I can't wait for the next instalment!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Definitely addictive. Keeps you coming back for more and thinking about how to solve it even when you're not playing it!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun and is constantly changing. I like the scrat game! I wish I had more time to play.
B00633W614|5.0|It is a sequel novel and I am on the second book. Really entertaining. I recommend it to all Jeffrey Archer fans
0393338827|5.0|Or maybe not.  Home ownership is not for everyone. The initial lack of affordability is just the first hurdle to overcome.  After that comes property insurance, taxes, repairs, cost of furnishings, and general upkeep.  First time homeowners, even if they would qualify on a regular loan, may find themselves getting behind if interest rates change, property insurance rises, utility costs go up, or the roof needs repairs (etc, etc, etc.). But the Great American Dream is home ownership, and darn it, we're going to see that everyone has that opportunity.<br /><br />What a wonderful opportunity for everyone in the real estate industry to make money off unqualified home buyers and speculators. The real estate agents, banks and mortgage companies, property appraisers, local governments (through property taxes), home builders and subcontractors.  Then Wall Street realized that they could package these \\"collateralized\\" home loans and sell them to investors. Even though the subprime loans (no money down, no verification of income, lack of loan documentation) were only backed by the value of the homes, Wall Street managed to get these collateralized home loans rated AAA, the same rating that United States government bonds receive.  Unbelievable amounts of money are being made by all the players in this market. The only problem was the lack of sufficient numbers of loans to be packaged and sold off as mortgage bonds.  So lending standards became even easier to meet. Not only were two year low rate teaser loans offered, but buyers could choose to actually defer the interest due instead of paying it and have it added to the principal amount of the loan. And since the supply/demand situation in the housing market kept home prices rising, the banks started pushing home equity lines so that people could tap the phantom equity in their home to build a pool, buy a new car, or take that trip they'd always wanted. So now home buyers with no money down, no verifiable income, and possibly not even paying interest on their primary mortgage, were literally given the additonal equity in their homes by the lending institutions to do with as they pleased.<br /><br />The Wall Street firms, never able to ignore easy profits, kept investing more and more of their capital into these potentially worthless loans. Many of these firms leveraged their capital so that $1.00 would control up to $40.00 of these assets.  The CEOs and investment bankers were making fortunes for themselves as each quarterly report outdid the previous one.  Unfortunately when housing prices began to fall, they were liable for the whole $40.00, not just the $1.00 they put up. The sad part of this is that the executives, virtually to a man, walked away with millions of dollars while their firms failed and hundreds of thousands of employees lost all or most of their pension funds.  Only a very few bright and insightful money managers managed to identify this crisis before it unfolded and made billions of dollars off the catastrophe.  This is their story.  I hope that you find it as fascinating as I did.not even paying interest on their primary mortgage, were literally given the additonal equity in their homes by the lending institutions to do with as they pleased.<br /><br />The Wall Street firms, never able to ignore easy profits, kept investing more and more of their capital into these potentially worthless loans.

0670026603|4.0|In \\"Me before You,\\" by Jojo Moyes, Will Traynor, a handsome, athletic, and successful financier in his mid-thirties, is struck by a motorbike in London as he is about to enter a taxi during a driving rainstorm. Will sustains a spinal cord injury that renders him a quadriplegic, dependent on others to feed, bathe, dress, and transport him. In addition, his condition leaves him vulnerable to such complications as infections, dangerous fluctuations in blood pressure, and bed sores.<br /><br />Fortunately, Will's parents can pay for the best medical care. Nathan, a trained nurse, capably tends to every aspect of his client's needs. However, no amount of wealth can buy peace of mind; Camilla, Will's distraught mother, sees her son slipping away from her emotionally. He needs someone stimulating to pull him out of his deep funk. Two years after Will's accident, the aloof Camilla hires a quirky working class girl, twenty-six year old Louisa Clark, to help take care of Will. Lou is hard-working, outspoken, and desperately in need of cash for her financially strapped family. She accepts the well-paid position, having no idea what the job will entail.<br /><br />Moyes creates a Pygmalion-like scenario in which the gruff, opinionated, and world-weary Will is, at first, extremely rude to his \\"latest minder\\" but is eventually charmed by her humor, lack of pretention, and outrageous fashion sense. Will is a sort of Henry Higgins to Lou's Eliza Doolittle. He exposes her to classical music, suggests books to read, and urges her to want something more than an unimaginative and unfulfilling existence. In turn, she is refreshingly upbeat, makes Will laugh, and even has the audacity to speak her mind. As Will and Lou get to know one another better, their relationship grows into one of genuine affection and mutual understanding.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Me before You\\" offers few surprises; the author presses all the anticipated emotional buttons. It somehow works, partly because Lou is such an appealing first-person narrator. In a few chapters, Will's mother, father, and primary caregiver speak out, offering their opinions about Will's circumstances as well as their own. Moyes draws us in with her lively and amusing dialogue, warmth, and poignant conclusion that will touch all but the hardest hearts. Book clubs will embrace this thought-provoking novel, since it offers such fertile ground for discussion.uch an appealing first-person narrator.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I think it is an average book, not as touching as the previous two books by Khaled Hosseini. At times it is very slow moving at towards the end , it is a bit confusing too. But i like the atmosphere created by Khaled Hosseini about Afghanistan but frankly speaking, i expected more.
159463176X|2.0|The first two books were excellent, the plots well crafted, and the characters bold and real.  They were books where the reader learned.  This book begins well enough and pulls one in, but it loses focus and the reader is lost.  I am disappointed.
0062255657|5.0|I wandered into the pages of 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' today, and didn't stop reading until I'd found my way to the end, held by the subtle magic of Gaiman's spell.<br /><br />The opening pages read as if I just wandered into a room and there's Neil, just starting his story, speaking to a group gathered round him. They immediately make room and I settle in and the words flow by, an open invitation to experience something beautiful, something personal, something just over the horizon of my everyday existence.<br /><br />The story that unfolds is one of children and adults, of monsters and the things even monsters fear, of a pond that might be an ocean, of cats and birds, of fairy-tale creatures with a Lovecraftian edge, of dark shadows and golden light. But mostly, and most surprisingly, 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a story of the fragility of memory and the power of stories. Though told largely from a child's perspective and with a child's sensibility, the overarching theme is that of an adult trying to peer back into his childhood, searching for an answer to the mysteries of his life and finding more than he bargained for.<br /><br />Gaiman's craft here has a purity and a keen eye for observations of the simple things. I was reminded strongly of what I love about 'Coraline,' but here the childlike simplicity and acceptance of strange and frightening things comes with a subtle complexity, looking through the lens of an adult's lost memories. Gaiman's prose is beautiful, simple, and - I can't stress this enough - natural, never losing its voice but also never shouting from the rooftops. 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a story that seems to tell itself, and invites the reader along for the ride.<br /><br />It's a kind of magic, what Neil Gaiman does here - weaving words into a tapestry of story and inviting us to take it in. 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a book that can be read easily in an afternoon, but it is likely to be one that stays with me for the rest of my days.<br /><br />I hold it in my hands and it's small, light, and seems somehow insignificant - yet it holds an ocean full of wonders to be discovered.ys with me for the rest of my days.<br /><br />I hold it in my hands and it's small, light, and seems somehow insignificant - yet it holds an ocean full of wonders to be discovered.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|Not my kinda story I guess.  I did finish it but it was hard.  The pace, story line, era, etc.... wasn't my thing.  I am not giving up on Hemingway though.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Although you know the ending, the film does a really good job of showing how it all unfolds. Intense and suspenseful.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|really makes you think loved it. can not wait for more levels to come out. will they let you know when to download them.  I hope!
B003OUXECE|3.0|This book is an odd one, if you are a fan of the Bioshock series you will probably love it as it expands on the whole mythology of Rapture built in the first two games of the series (specially through the audio diaries scattered across rapture), and sets the stage neatly for the events of Bioshock 1.<br /><br />However seen as a standalone product, when presented to someone who doesn't have the story told in the games as a framework it certainly seems less appealing.<br /><br />The problem relies not on the story told but in the manner it is conveyed to the reader. The book is written to show the events from the perspective of too many characters (including but not limited to: Andrew Ryan, Bill McDonagh, Frank Fontaine, Bill Sullivan), this makes all the interweaving story threads feel somewhat disjointed and undermines the impact of some of the events.<br /><br />The book disposes of a protagonist (though one of the characters I mentioned before could maybe be called that if you use the term very loosely), and opts for something similar to an ensemble cast to move the story forward, not giving any of the characters any significant time for exposition or to  at least make the reader endear to any of them, this only causes a jarring effect as you jump from one perspective to another with each chapter and makes the narrative move at a plodding pace at times.<br /><br />As a fan of the games, and knowing how everything pans out after the events therein, I must say it is a flawed but entertaining read. The first few chapters are slow and somewhat uneventful but they serve to expand on so many things we thought we knew about these characters and their motivations from the games.<br /><br />The story significantly picks up the pace on the second half of the book and I must admit that from that moment on I had a hard time putting the book down until I finished it.<br /><br />A positive fact from the way the book is written is that it took me back to Rapture, remembering the various locales from the game as well  as the key characters and some of the secondary and even tertiary ones hat did not get a spotlight on Bioshock 1 & 2.<br /><br />My recomendation:  this book is a must have for Bioshock fans, even with a somewhat flawed narrative, however, I would recommend finishing both games (specially Bioshock 1), before picking this one up. For regular readers, there are similar stories that cover the same ideas  and themes which offer a far superior reading experience (Atlas Shrugged would be a nice starting point).

B00AESN8XY|4.0|The idea behind this game is kind of sinister, but I love strategy games. This one is a bit too hard though. In order to advance you must beat each level at the medium or hard ranking. A great time passer, and I would have given it 5 stars if I could play all the levels.

He ultimately rescues the good twin who speaks German and doesn't have a name, just a number, as in the oldie but goodie \\" Secret  Agent \\";and barely survives being murdered by his killer bad twin son, who is actually called the \\"good\\"twin by the Nazi's. Helen's finally gone for good, just as well, and I just don't care what happens to the rest of them any longer.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The little Mae Mobley was a disappointment but Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone earned Awards.  What wonderful actors!.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Delightful, humerous, interesting, well written.  Could have been my family doing the male-bonding whole hog BBQ rituals!  A terrific read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use.  Easy to read.  Convenient. Sometimes it is just easier to use a calculator..especially when there's no pencil and paper around.
0061969664|4.0|All of Cornwells books are well researched and written. He really takes you into history and makes it fun, not dry. I really liked The Fort, it was a campaign I was familiar with.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved it..surprises at every turn..didn't see anything coming..tugged at your heart especially being a parent of a child around the same age
B002RI90WM|5.0|If you ever thought dogs should be able to talk you gonna love this book<br /><br />A sensitive ,warm and friendly book with a lot of  meaning
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I enjoyed this immensely, as did my wife.  Fast paced, characters you can relate to, a story with just enough twists and turns to entice you without getting confusing.  Ryan is an excellent wordsmith and I am awaiting another book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|the perks of<br />being a wallflower is a very touching book, i wasn't sure if i would like it because it seemed a little old for me but i understood it very well, i highly recommend this book to any teen or adult<br />because this is a true work of literature that teaches many lessons about life
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Absolutely fantastic acting from the main characters... The plots were intriguing, and the overall story line was thrilling.. I highly recommend this show.
B00BAYLS1K|4.0|A really good way to pass a couple of hours.  Another story of dancing, similar to DANCE WITH ME, that has a feel good ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like 100 Floors, only better! The only complaint I have is that there are not more rooms to play yet!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Beautiful way to display all my favorite pins. Great app. I give it 5 stars for being so darn addicting and easy to use as well.
B00867GJYK|5.0|If you don't already know how brilliant Finding Nemo is then there's nothing I can say to help you. What I can confirm is that the special features, audio and video quality are top quality on this release. A must-buy.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Watched with my 12 year old, & we both loved it....will watch many more movies on Amazon! Thank you all!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the few series that I cried on multiple episodes. Just when I think things would get better for the Crawley family, things take a twist. I even found myself watching the episodes again from the beginning, and I am a very picky person when it comes to television shows.<br /><br />I hate that I will not get a chance to see series four until January of next year. I wish I lived in London so I could watch it in September. I might end up having to watch the first three seasons repeatedly until then.
B004LROUW2|4.0|He is a wonderful writter. You go inside the story. Fantastic situations create an amazing pleasure to read. Love it.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I wanted to load this on my computer without worrying about a disk each time.  It indicates you can do that, however, it continued to insist on having the disk before it would load.  This is very old style and not to my liking.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Even though I already own a horse this app is amazing. its almost like taking care of a horse. I belive it gives kids the feeling of haveing tthere very own horse even though they are unable to. if you are unable to have a horse or don't have one I suggest this app. :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a really great game.  I am having fun with it.  It makes you think, memorize and use  logic.
0385349831|4.0|This book by Paul Coelho is in a sense a historical novel, one based on a true event.  It is 1099.  Jerusalem is besieged by Crusaders and tomorrow the battle for the city will begin.  We know from history what actually happened--the city fell, and the inhabitants were, for the most part, massacred.  We can imagine people's dread and horror.  I say we can imagine them because the author certainly does not show them to us.<br /><br />I admired Coelho's earlier book, THE ALCHEMIST and I hoped his new book would offer a deeper view of his spiritual beliefs.  There is much that is uplifting here, but something is missing.  The reality of suffering?  What is actually must have been like for Jerusalem's inhabitants, waiting to die?  We never see the battle or the slaughter to come, just witness a calm discourse before the battle takes place.  Emphasize calm.  People ask questions and get a spiritual teacher's answers. All apparently are satisfied with the answers they get; no challenging voices are raised. No one seems particularly upset that they and their love ones are in a besieged city.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad book.  Eternal spiritual truths are beautifully expressed.  But I was expecting something to rival, say, Victor Frankl's account of surviving spiritually in the Nazi death camps, MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING.  I expected too much.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Excellent Book! Great story with good action and about two dozen key stand out moments. Takes place about a year after Pursuit of Honor.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|what could be a better time waster than this? I love how well done all the rooms are. the attention to detail is wonderful!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I never heard of Game of Thrones before the show which I am greatly ashamed because the show is only half as great as the books.
B0091REZMW|4.0|at first the game was very fun but then this goblin guy showed up and you have to spend you coins on banishing him. I tried to banish it. twice. but it didn't work so I wasted coins 2400 coins! on top of that my game is like frozen except for the goblin guy and I cant do anything. if it fixes itself then I may change my mind on the rating but for now its 4 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|OK game.  challenging in parts.  After a certain number of attempts, seems to let you win.<br />More guidance on function of each bird type would be helpful.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun and addicting. wish I didn't need so many diamonds all the time.  also wish the objects were different for the rooms.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Enjoyed program.  nice mix of comedy and lawyer drama.<br />Interaction between the characters will make for a good first season
B000FC1HBY|2.0|Generally I don't bother reviewing books that are as popular as this series has become because honestly I'm just a drop in the bucket at this point but low and behold here I am throwing my two cents in. This review might contain some minor spoilers so you've been warned.<br /><br />I have to say that after reading the first in this series that I fell in love. I was absolutely hooked from the very beginning and could not put that book down. Unfortunately like many middle books in a series A Clash of Kings has some rather dull stretched out moments through out. While it's obvious that the majority of the story is building for one final amazing moment when it does eventually come it's somewhat underwhelming at best and almost told in it's entirety as a flashback. I also found the number of character view points to be too much and some of them unnecessary.<br /><br />What really got to me though and the reason that I'm only giving this book 2 stars is that I found the amount of violence toward women to be completely over the top and just disgusting. Don't get me wrong I totally get what George RR Martin was going for with the society of this world and the first book also had mentioning of the same brutality towards women but the difference is that it is just completely shoved in your face for the entire story here. I'm not exaggerating that every.single.chapter told from many different characters has some woman being raped and murdered or in some other way being beaten and abused. It is just way too much! It honestly just became to hard to read at points.<br /><br />Actually after typing this out I have changed my review from 3 to 2 stars as I am just appalled by this book and the way it plays into the rape culture of today. I'll probably still continue and read at least the 3rd book to see some conclusion but if the 3rd is written like the 2nd that will be the end of the series for me. For those that want to continue with the series I would of course recommend this book as you really cannot skip it but I would warn anyone that has a hard time reading about abuse because this book takes it to a whole new level than the first one did.k as you really cannot skip it but I would warn anyone that has a hard time reading about abuse because this book takes it to a whole new level than the first one did.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I liked this book, I really did, but I just wanted to like it so much more. I think I may have set myself up for disappointment on this one. I have wanted to read this book for a long time, it's not available through the library, so a price drop on amazon seemed like a sign.<br /><br />I wanted the book to tell me more of what makes here who she is. I understand wanting to not reveal to much, but for an autobiography I wanted a bit more.<br />I wanted the book to be funnier. I laughed at a few points, but in the end I felt a bit let down.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was where the honeymoon story fell. I realize this is one of my personal pet peeves. I don't understand the lack of a liner timeline. I was surprised when she pointed out that she had been on SNL two years, and then later in the book was the story about getting the SNL gig.<br /><br />Overall I am glad I read the book, and would recommend it. It was a fun quick read.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|this is some of the best music from j. cole. I judge an album based on how many of the tracks I like and I like every track on this album 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I am so glad I am finished with this book! There were just so many things I really didn't like about it. I try really hard to not to judge a book to harshly and sometimes after thinking about it for a bit I do revise my view, but I am fairly sure this book isn't going to get better in my mind.<br /><br />The first part of the book I thought drug terribly. I felt like I was trying to walk through molasses. I kept finding other things to do than read, not a good sign at all. I was so excited when a new book became available from the library, that I buckled down to finish this one. I don't like to abandon books, and won't until I have read at least 100 pages.<br /><br />I disliked the way gender was used in this book. It felt kind of slimy to me. It took the absolute worst of both sexes and made that the central theme. It seemed to belittled truly horrible things in the name of entertainment.<br /><br />A rather nitpicking thing that got to me was the lack of consistency with the female detectives name. Sometimes the first name was used, sometimes the last, with no perceivable rhyme or reason. Making me try and remember who the character was through out the book. I didn't catch that being done with other characters leaving me to wonder, why her?<br /><br />There were other things that annoyed me through out the book, but all small enough to be overlooked. I did like the mention of my home town (yay Muscatine). I like that I wasn't able to figure things out to early on
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show effectively demonstrates the division between young and old during the early 1900s in the UK.  Changes in the role of women and the fear of Roman Catholic (Left Footers) being part of the family are informative and entertaining.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read this after reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  This book was haunting, a page turner, and was almost disturbing.  An incredible read, and in spite of what I've said, I highly recommend it.
0761169253|5.0|Just buy it.  Don't even think about it.  If something drew you to this book, then you'll find something awesome in its pages.  Austin Kleon does a great job of opening up your creativity with his top ten list of things that artists do.  Let's face it, we are all artists, or at least, we should all be trying to be artists, in our everyday work and lives.  I love the quotes and the straightforward advice to improve yourself by working through what you've already got.  So, like I said, JUST BUY IT.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read this after reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  She writes some haunting pieces that are disturbing to the soul.  It's hard to reach that deep into the reader, but Flynn knows how to do it before you realize she's there.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I paid 9.99 for this book. I had to make my self read it . I keep thinking it was going to get better.it  went on and on about the games they played and things that had nothing to do with the book.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|ONLY because I'm in love with Charleston, SC 1966, have I had a little more difficulty getting comfortable with these songs.  However, Darius is an all time favorite of both me and my family.  Wagon Wheel, especially with its video production and inclusion of the Duck Dynasty stars has been a highlight of the summer for my kids.  Darius is the man!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|it had a very good story. could not stop reading it.,i would tell anybody to buy this book. its great
B000002MY3|5.0|I had lost this CD in my many moves since being in my mid 20's.  Great return to my years of being a young woman full of dreams and realizing life's many realities.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Still enjoying the 007 franchise. I'm just glad there's not a &#34;007 vs. Zombies&#34; or a &#34;007 and the Covert Operations to Sabotage the Rouge Mutant Extraterrestrial Federation Battalion of the Andromeda Galaxy from Invading Earth - Part 1&#34; as part of the 007 line-up.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great plot lines and development of characters.  Each of the episodes followed the others.  I looked forward to watching this series and look forward to more.
B007PEX1SC|4.0|The record was in good shape. It's a change up from the famous bathroom toilet. Goes nice in my collection. I gave it a four and not a five because it wasn't in the greatest conditions and the lp sleeve was missing.(at least bye a standard sleeve for your customers, it looks better).Fast shipping, thanks.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Video quality on streaming was good not great I am sure if I use HD it would be much better.  Did have some trouble with streaming content after about one week not sure why???
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you enjoy the movies and enjoy collecting coins and dodging obstacles than you will enjoy this great game.<br />Enjoy.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|Great album. Probably their best album yet. I like how the sound is heavier, with more chugging riffs and prominent drumbeats. Amy's vocals are, as always, great, and set against the aforementioned sound, make this album a must-buy for any Ev fan or fan of chick-fronted rock/metal bands.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I think that Warm Bodies is a very cute love story that could have been so much more adorable if it had been a little longer and gave the heroes more ambitious/challenging scripting and perhaps made a more happily ever after ending... this ending left me kind of feeling flat and dis-satisfied.  overall I enjoyed the story...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a great game to challenge your brain and can someone help me with the cubes on level 6 with the number 168.(:
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We opted to purchase the 3-disc set (used), since it was the same price as the 2-disc. That was a great idea as the collector's set comes with alternate endings, etc. - great buy!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Great game with dynamic gameplay but the game is completely ruined by in game purchases. You hit a point where you can't progress unless you use real money or do things multiple times.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Bought the disc used, however we haven't yet downloaded the ultraviolet digital copy. It should be interesting to see if that works on multiple platforms (i.e., PS3, computer, tablet)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun to figure out each level.<br />like the puzzles on each page and trying to figure them out.  challenging but not too hard.
B006VRDZ44|5.0|Best TV series ever.  It takes a little getting use to, but an absolute blast.  Very deep story line, great acting, great writing, great music and filmography, just great everything.  Plot is great and doesn't disappoint in any fashion.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory Porter is performing at Jazz Alley in Seattle this week end and you can bet I will be there...So love this CD I am so looking forward to his new CD that comes out in September. If you have not heard his music...Treat yourself
B0036T31YY|3.0|This movie starts off pretty good, but falls apart before it's over.  The story has plenty of build up, but squanders it in the end.  The main actress kills her role, other supporting actors leave something to be desired.  I think the writers fall back on your imagination in some parts to make the movie more suspenseful than it really is.  Characters don't develop with time, which does follow the story, but is somewhat disappointing.  Unlike many movies, this one starts off deep and ends in shallow thought.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I'm hooked!  There is enough variety to keep me interested and wanting more. The strength of the lead character is still a mom.<br /><br />Grammy
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as great as season one, but still pretty good.  It would have been easier to follow if they didn't reuse cast members and tried tying it into season one some how.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A little slow at the start but not so the rest of the movie. Great cast. Looking forward to Red 2.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|This movie is the equivalent of Twilight aimed at southerners.  But it's packed with bad acting, bad writing, bad music and just about everything else.  It just goes to show you when you think things can't get any worse, they do.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game with family and friends Everyday...even if it is only for a few minutes! It is great fun because it has so many features and rooms!
B000002J5K|5.0|Bought in with the Blues Brothers 2000 CD so would have both movie soundtracks.<br />Great jazz, blues, swing - fun music, timeless.<br />Buy both CDs.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a good read.  A little slow in some areas.  But none the less a good read.  Didn't expect the ending. I would recommend this book.
B000005B0U|5.0|Recently saw the movie again, loved the jazz & blues music, so bot this CD.<br />Great music, swings, all tracks fun.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|aside from sex changes, what happened to the wachowskis? this is terrible. bounces from time period to time period and back again. i get the story, past lives all affect our future lives blah blah blah...yawn...ah yes after 3 hours crdits roll. i want my 3 hours back. theres some excellent camera work and special effects in this but for every one of those scenes theres a character with makeup making them look asian or white or black or black and asian or some other ethnicity than what they actually are. its truly creepy and comical at the same time. oh and apparently 400 years in the future those of us that are left all talk like jar jar binks. lame. really.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed it, can`t wait for new levels! Very addictive as a different type of challenge. Found it difficult to find hidden room on one level!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Awesome show ...love the stories and the characters I'll be very sad if there's no more seasons to watch anymore
B000001ESJ|5.0|nothing else needs to be said,  its worth having their complete cd catalog, Rush are the pioneers and kings of progressive rock.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|For &#34;way with words&#34; and &#34;imagery&#34;, I would give this novel a 5 star rating.  It heightened my cultural awareness. The plot kept my interest.  The blogs were a bit much sometimes-almost too deep.
B000002GB9|5.0|excellent of course... hard to go wrong with music from any of the classic rock giants Styx, Journey, Eagles, Kansas etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun I am playing it more than minecraft. So I give it  5 stars. you guys should try it your self.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I've seen the first movie nd it's just like it ...<br />TIP : in code red wait till your dino's clock is almost full.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This is a cute game for my little girl. I wish she could unlock features by earning them in the game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a great product, I received it in a timely manner and I was able to plug it into the charger and use it right out of the box.
141659521X|5.0|What can I say about Vince Flynn's books that hasn't already been said by others? The Last Man is another page turner, with perhaps too little of Rapp getting stuck in to the baddies, but that is only my personal view. Once started it was hard to put down - only the lack of sleep caused me to place the book on the bedside table. I only hope Hollywood wakes up to the Flynn books, and creates some great films out of his stories.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is absolutely awesome for the price.  I was having a hard time finding a Barbie brand container for all of my daughter's Barbie items and this is perfect.  Plus it opens up and becomes a little play house.  It's great!
B00004W510|5.0|This was an album my husband once had, but we gave up the LPS recently.  Now he is able to listen to his favorites again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One of the top 5 books I've ever read.  I'm blown away.  This book has recently been made into a movie but I have no desire to see it.  It couldn't possibly compare to the masterpiece I just experienced.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Very nice!! Very nice!!  Vocals, instrumentals, it all is quality leonard.  What more can I say.........if you like Leonard Cohen, then you will enjoy Live In London.
B00124HR22|5.0|Hearing this and &#34;Love it to Death&#34; at relatively the same time in 1973/4, helped tailor my love for the band and Heavy rock theatrics.<br />I believe I had a flashback to when I actually listened to these with the girl I was hangin with at the time when I picked this up again. the barrage of guitar and the solid backbone of Drums and Bass were phenomenal. I'm of the opinion they defined music and created followers world wide with their special blend of bombastics. Will always hold a special place in my heart. 5 Stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game it requires skill and concentration but it is really simple to play I recommend this game to any one and its a simple 10 out of 10
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good to play at night before bed, challenging but too much so, good for all ages. ok I'm sleepy now
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it you have to run away from the creature and you can get power ups to make you turn invisible and go really fast and to have a magnetic field over you.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Purchased for my mother who is a fan. She did mention she prefers his covered tracks over his original music. Great deal purchasing at Amazon due to the free shipping and instant mp3 download
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it you get to slide down the rope and you have cool power ups there is one you can go really fast and you can turn invisible and you have a magnetic field over you and you have a protection field over you. And you also have gems to revive you. You can also you can get in to a mine cart and go through a tunnel. So better than the first temple run.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|luv this album. great to have the group back. Phoenix is my favorite. Don't miss out on the album but just purchasing 1 track. you wont be disappointed
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This true story is amazing. Parts were difficult to read, but I think the American public should know what happened to this woman. I hope it helps to improve our probation system and encourage people to get to know their neighbors. It's a disgrace that this could happen to anyone.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This movie inspired me to read the book. Anne Bancroft is perfect for this role. A great role for John Hopkins too.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I don't need so much human eating from the giants... and that scene where the stalk grows up through the giant... disgusting. Too much. Performances are very good though and I like the writing... nice take on the story... love the cast.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Great to hear the beach boys live. I suggest to do the whole concert on DVD albeit there is a short version of 21 songs. As good as ever and&#34;A put them up against anyone after all these years. If one is having a bad day put this on the cd at home or in the car and it is just unbelievable. STones great Beatles great. Beach boys 50 years is unreal but they are &#34;Americas Band&#34;. Lets hope they get together again and or work on a new CD. Hearing Brian Wilson and Al Jardine and David Marks to work with Jeff Beck. Talented individuals to make the sounds of summer always a treat.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|The downside of this service is that it often doesn't work. I often have to force quit the app on my iphone or reboot the phone to get it to stream music. I get lots of cryptic error messages. There is no public API. There is no support. Amazon seems to be doing everything it can to hide how buggy their service is. The file tagging and upload interface is at best a proof of concept thrown together by some students... Adobe Air? Really? Most of my album artwork is completely wrong... I have a number of albums whose matched artwork is not only incorrect but offensive. Wouldn't it be nice if I could upload my own artwork without uploading all my music again? The problem is that it's slightly better than the other options currently available.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Like a fine wine they get better with every short tour with Uncle Neil or without. So talented and the voices so clear. Better to listen to CSN than listen to the news. Music can express so much. Keep on rockin and touring.
B000JZ45LQ|1.0|This was a concert movie. The point of of a concert is to hear the songs. On Amazon Instant Video, the sound was terrible. Really muddy and quiet. The strange thing that the talking between the songs sounded good, but as soon as Cher started singing, it all went to H**l. Such a shame.
