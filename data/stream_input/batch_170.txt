B00IY2D8JQ|5|I have only washed this twice and used once but it didn't leak and I was able to get completely clean. I read a few reviews of other types of reusable pouches and people complained they could get them completely clean inside the corners. I didn't have this problem at all. I put applesauce with cinnamon sprinkled in it. I'm excited to try other food items. I also received this about 3-4 days after I ordered whivh was quicker than the &#34;estimated shipping&#34;. Very happy with this product!
B004LD6VLO|4|As described.
B004FPYG7O|5|These replacement spouts are the perfect fit for the NUK soppy cup. My toddler just loves these cups. The spout is easy to drink out of.
B004YRDQBK|5|Perfect for footprints! Washed right off without leaving any staining on my baby's feet.
B001CWDCY6|5|So soft, fit my oddly shaped antique bassinet mattress!
B00AWMP880|3|Got this for my baby so I could have her sleeping close by while I kept an eye on my other child. I like that it's portable and very easy to set up and fold up to go. I like that that it zips up for sun and bug protection when outside. The only thing I didn't like is that there isn't enough cushion so my baby doesn't sleep as well in it all the time.
B00A72MXPG|1|It is ridiculously difficult to get the car seat out of the base and it doesn't click into place in the stroller.  Don't buy it.
B00264YZNG|1|I received a different pacifier than I ordered. The one I chose said daddy's girl I received a plain silver zebra striped pacifier.
B004CLYZ0O|5|thank you much , very happy with the product. would order them again at any time.<br />the quality is excelent<br />sincerely erika
B001RAFWEG|5|Love this car seat! So so so easy to install. Very lightweight and slim. We have a Mercedes Benz crossover and the backseat isn't exactly large. I can still fit two larger adults in the backseat if the car seat is in the middle.<br />My only complaint is that the cover &#34;pilled&#34; on the bottom where my daughter's feet are. It's otherwise easy to clean and easy to strap her into. She seems very comfortable in it. We have taken 3 10+ hour road tris in it over the past three months.
B002USE15U|5|We have these blankets for our boys, 5mo, and 7yo.  Purchased them for a gift this time for a new mommy.  They are so great, especially for learning to swaddle.
B00LUJFBCW|5|This is heavenly soft I love it and I know my daughter is going to love it too this is around the same price as at the store but they never have this kind of color it's gorgeous and it fits a standard crib size this reminds me of the minky blankets soo soft.
B00368CLXW|5|It's grate, it covers the hole carseat, the Best thing si that is so easy to put and prevents the car seat from damaging the leathet of the seat
B000JOT2RO|3|I was really looking forward to these bowls to avoid my grandson tipping his food upside down, these bowls will not help.  The bowls themselves are nice little bowls, especially the one with the lid, but the suction does not hold but a few sec/min.  Not what I expected or needed. I have tried multiple surfaces an none work.
B004GJXMAQ|5|The monkey changing pad cover was exactly what my daughter in law wanted for the nursery. It looked even better upon arrival than presented in the picture. It felt very nicely made also.
B00AV53YI4|2|This product is nicely made but it just did not work for our needs. I wanted a good bottle for my 15 month who was resistant to sippy cups. The bottle when full is too heavy for her to hold and she would drop it. In addition she sucks so hard on the top that the pressure makes the spout cave in and no water comes out with out us unscrewing it and letting out the pressure. We found some other less expensive bottles that work for us and we stocked up on them.
B00916XTDE|5|Very Sturdy using them as storage in a closet also nice looking
B008N6WID0|5|Came with 2 footmuffs - one for winter and one for spring. Both are great and keep my baby warm and cozy.
B00Q281IRI|5|Love this bag!!! Has lots of pockets
B002C30S96|5|my grandson loved it good price too
B002V87MJQ|5|Fast Shipping. Daughter Loves It! And so do I, it gives my daughter her much needed space to roam. Only downside I had to buy my own foam mats. Not a bad price at babies r us, 25 bucks for a huge pack of both alphabets and numbers. :) Overall happy customer.
B0052G1A38|5|My 9-month old baby is not that into them yet but the balls are certainly fun for the rest of the family.
B004P1IVQA|5|Super soft and comfy!
B002KE1CBA|5|Excellent toy for young babies (5 months).
B004CLYZ0O|3|I was particularly seeking white bibs - ones I could bleach baby food out of.  While these are in fact white, they are quite thin and aren't very effective at keeping the baby dry.
B001RXWKJS|5|Great Gift<br /><br />excellent quality, still being used like new 2 years later, i would recommened this product for new moms<br /><br />thanks
B000E89BNU|5|This brush cleans really well, and the suction cup is wonderful - very sanitary and convenient.  I agree with the reviewers that the brush doesn't go in as easily as others, but the trade-off is a really clean bottle with minimal effort, thanks to the firmness of the bristles.  And if you hold the bottle with the opening facing down when pulling out the brush, there really isn't that much spray.  As for the issues with rust that other reviewers have mentioned, I haven't had that problem, but I've only been using this brush for a month, so perhaps I'll have to amend my review at a later date.  I also use this brush on my wine glasses - it's nice to know I'll be able to keep using it once the bottles are gone.
B000CSBP3G|1|These are exactly what I needed with 9 month old twins - I found I was picking up so many cheerios, puffs and food off the floor after they finished eating and thought to myself \\"why don't they make bibs that can catch the food\\" and I was thrilled to see that they do. They don't love it when I put them on but are fine and they catch everything. Clean up is a breeze now. Highly recommend!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />These worked for a couple of days and I loved them because they caught the food. The problem was that my boys quickly figured out how to take them off and they would throw them full of food so they were pointless. It took them about 3 days to figure them out, don't waste your $
B002ANVGVC|5|Perfect!  I'm not a decal person but my husband really wanted to use a decal to decorate the nursery.  This was perfect.  Very easy to use and removable if you change your mind.  They give you a TON of animals and we didn't use all of them, really good value for the price- def recommend.
B00KX5VGDM|4|I bought it for my cousin so haven't used it personally but it seems based on research she did she is very interested in your product.
B003G4VUFQ|5|So soft and cuddly this sweet lamb's head slowly moves when the music plays.  I gave as a gift and Mom said she was sure it would soon be her baby girl's favorite.
B00ED1Y9UY|1|Really wanted to love this. Bought this first set... the workmanship is awful. Sharp steel edge below the plastic. And within a month, the plastic broke off. Then bought ANOTHER set thinking the first set was probably defective... UGH! Same sharp steel edge below plastic on EVERY utensil. And again, first month BROKEN!!! Terrible quality -- pointy metal bit cut my finger!!! Paid $6 so not worth the effort to return.
B008JG2N9I|1|These do not work, a waste of money. I ended up just take my bag back to Nordstrom and bought the bag that is magnetic from the supplier versus trying to shush the velcro and making it magnetic.
B00F2MQ0GO|5|We bought this product about a month before he was ready to potty train.<br />We talked about it and asked him all the time if we wanted to go! And just one day, he said, I want to go to the potty.  He sat on it for hours at a time over a weekend! But that was ok, because when the train came to the station, we was so proud of himself. He has been trained for months and he still tells me to look at what he has done!
B001TK32IM|4|We received this as a baby shower gift.  Sometime over the past 10 months it went missing.  We thought it would turn up but we finally gave in and bought another one.  This blanket is super soft and lovely.  It loses one star for needing to be blocked out to dry which is sort of a pain for me personally... but again we loved it so much I'm willing to give up a bit of convenience.
B00ESXTNQ2|2|The picture is misleading - they really need to be specific that you are only getting 1<br />in not good
B00IR4F2A4|5|Bought this for my grandson's highchair, but now, 8 months later, he still loves it! We started by sticking this to my grandson's highchair, now it rests in the toybox, and he still pulls it out and plays with it at 1 year old.<br />Very cute, with a clicking noise when rotated. Colorful with a mirror on the bottom of one foot.<br />Babies love it!
B0072WI4OI|5|Excellent bag! Very nice pattern. Usefull for my needs.
B00BMK0NQI|4|It works perfect for my newborn.
B0054SOSZG|3|Not girl cups as pictured.  I know it said design my vary but I assumed it would be one of the two pictured.  Instead I got two race car cups.
B00JU4ZJEE|1|Too hard to put on him!
B003JHYDIQ|4|I want to love these. However, I was only able to use them for about the first six weeks of my twin boys life. It was ridiculous how it barely fit them past 9 lbs. The velcro goes bad after a few washes, and then the kiddos get out of these quickly.
B0058K5IIQ|4|My child plays on it, gives that extra cushion that he needs when crawling and sitting.  and keeps warms, if you have bare floor or laminate floor
B0017KSMCK|4|Not quite as detailed in real life but still very cute and very soft. Materials certainly didn't look expensive but I gave it as part of a gift and baby's Mom liked it and it received an appreciative squeeze from baby. That's good enough for me.
B002ITDA9Y|2|I have friends that like it, but our son didn't.  I'd recommend trying one first, we got ok at using it, but it's hard to put a sleeping baby in it or take a sleeping baby out without waking them up, for that reason I'm giving it low marks. It was good quality though.
B000A16ZNU|5|I have used 4 of theses chairs in a commercial setting (childcare facility) for the past two years.  These chairs are the best investment I ever made.  After two years of constant use for children between the ages of 0-18 months, these chairs are still like new.  They are very durable, easy to clean, and you can't beat all the features.  A child can sleep in this high chair very comfortably.  You can recline it , and rock them to sleep. The tray has 4 positions and thr entire chair can be lowered (adjusted to 4 different heights) It may even be five; I can't remember.  I LOVE THIS CHAIR PERIOD!!! It has made life a lot easier.
B00O8Y5FAO|5|My son love them as well as we!!
B00AZYLCH6|3|Idea there. Nipple too thin and wide. Handles too wide. Maybe for an older baby. Not a 6 month old. Dexterity needed for this one. Nice colors and good weight to bottle. Easy to read measurements
B0054WHTRG|1|The item shipped without box.<br />And the plastic package has been damaged, so I have to wash the product before my baby use it.
B003FGX8SW|5|My family loves our Itzy Ritzy lunch bags! We have two sandwich bags (one in the pink/green chevron pattern and the other in the cupcake pattern) and two snack bags, both in the cupcake pattern. We love the material and how easy it is to wash and reuse them. My daughters definitely have the most fashionable (and eco-friendly!) lunch in the cafeteria!
B0042D69V0|1|Everything was perfect but the seat that snaps down into the jumpy...it is warped and will not stay in place so when you pick baby up the whole seat come out with him. :(
B00POLTF2O|5|love it
B001CWI37M|5|great looks wonderful.
B002SZT35S|4|We ordered this for our 10 month old son. He was an early walker and now is learning to climb. His new trick is climbing on toys he drags over to the entertainment center to try to rock the tv. As soon as he did that I knew we were in trouble so i ordered this strap kit right away. We also live in California so I thought strapping the tv to the wall for earthquakes was a smart move too. It was easy to install into the wall studs took all of 10 minutes with my husbands power drill. The only problem was the excess straps have slack to them that was driving our cat crazy so we had to tape the excess straps to the taught straps which is very ugly looking but it is safe now and not driving the cat insane.
B007ZBVJXY|4|Cute print. Easy to put on child. Would be easier to use if there were a velcro attachment as opposed to the ribbon.
B0043XHUYO|3|not the best quaility blanket everytime I wash it it gets very worn and the soft fuzz comes off on her binkiy or the cup its only sown together on the outside linning so it is kinda thin also
B007OQP6A2|4|This worked completely fine for my daughter, but it isn't really comfortable, so you child will not be happy if you frequently travel long distances.
B00KWR2BCQ|5|The pillow is the perfect size for my 2 year old. Nice and soft with the matching pillow case. He loves it!
B00CL2H1OI|4|A unique spin on the usual teething rings and infant balls, great for the future computer engineer, nfl draft, or crest toothpaste cover child. Reminds me of the metal/ wooden puzzle/ brain teaser trinket puzzles my dad, grampa, his dad, etc like to keep on their coffee table and fiddle with... but for babies!
B004CQGD7W|5|Great product, currently used by a 1 year old, holds most plates and bowls very well, found that non-plastic plates and bowls actually hold better, this is much better than a bowl/plate that has the suction cups attached to them permanently.
B0009XBX4K|5|This product was just as advertised. In original packaging and sealed. If you want a lot of bottles for a good price, this is it.
B0093GQ11O|4|As described.  Easy to use.
B000P22YTI|5|These are great because the little toy rests on my babies chest to help him keep hold of the pacifier. This was the first thing my baby ever held other than my fingers.<br /><br />It's the only pacifier we use.
B0001WAO8U|4|product as described--shipped in 2 days
B00BDCNSXA|5|This phenomenal product has definitely exceeded my expectations in a baby monitoring device.  I work in healthcare and while statistics of complications are low, my son is priceless and my mind has been at ease with the Safe to Sleep monitor.  I bought this device for my son when he was born and I still use it today at 5 months old  He loves to sleep on his stomach and this mat allows me to let him sleep comfortably.  My wife and I get better sleep too.  It's a WIN WIN situation.  I highly recommend this product!
B0074JKQ0Y|5|Makes life easier when traveling through the airport and needing your car seat with you.  Must have!
B00005BMDX|1|Since my four month old daughter was born I've used the Dr. Brown's bottles (which are great).  However, I decided to also try the VentAire bottles.  I was very disappointed from the start because the nippple was VERY slow, even to the point where no formula would come out.  The first time I used this bottle my daughter was sucking away and after five minutes I checked the bottle and the formula level hadn't gone down at all.  She was very frustrated.  I even tried pushing water through the nipple myself while cleaning it, and that didn't help.  Not wanting to give up, I then decided to try the VentAire stage two nipple, thinking it was maybe similar to that of the Dr.Brown's stage one.  That one made the formula come out much to fast.  As a last try I decided to buy some new stage one VentAire nipples... they were just as bad as the first.  Many of my friends have tried these bottles also and have had the same complaints about the nipples.  Aside of the nipple, I like the bottle set-up (the curve to the bottle) and was hoping it would be good for when my daughter can hold it on her own... After my experience I'm going to stick with the Dr. Brown's.
B000056W4V|3|Great bottles, but the nipples get fast after a few weeks of use. Mine are a month old and the milk comes out in a pretty fast steady stream if you tip them over. Not the best for month old infant that needs the slow nipple. Other than the nipple, a great product.
B001GQ2SA2|5|love this.  he enjoys watching the mobile and projection.  i havent put him to sleep in the crib for the night yet, but hes good for naps with just the music playing.  the 20 minute length gives me a good idea how long hes asleep.  :)
B004DFO57M|5|I just adore these scissors!  I am intimidated by the normal nail clippers for trimming baby claws, especially after an accident involved with the said tool.  I came across these scissors while searching for an alternative and I just love them.  I can safely clip his nails even while he's wiggling.  They come with a protective case, the tips are not sharp and I really appreciate the slight curve in the blade.  It really helps get the job done.  I will be purchasing these scissors for future baby shower gifts because this is a must have baby care product for me.
B002VBXY5O|5|This little chair is fantastic.  My son prefers sleeping in this to his bassinet, and at this point I feel that we should have two of them (one for upstairs in the bedroom and another for downstairs daytime use) because we've been taking the chair upstairs every night for him to sleep in!  It is very very comfortable, and the material is easy to clean and removable.  It's also a great price for what you get! When I think of how much we use it, it is absolutely worth it!
B005ASKQ42|5|I searched and searched for a travel crib or bassinet for an extended road trip with our baby and was starting to lose hope when a friend gave this to me - it has been perfect! Small and portable, lightweight, and gets baby up and off the ground. Folding it up is also fairly easy and it has a little handle. Sometimes we used it on the floor of our camper, sometimes by the campfire or in a hotel room and sometimes inside the bed as a co-sleeper. I love the the sides are firm mesh, some of the other travel pods make me nervous.<br /><br />The only downfall is that it's  meant to be used up to 15lbs. I've stretched it but with my baby now being 16 1/2 lbs it's starting to sag and I'm looking for something new. I'm definitely going to hang on to it to use if we have another kid.
B002FKE4UU|5|These are a mommys best friend. I use to just wipe down the table when out with a clorox wipe. After doing that one time and the wipe being completely black I was done. Now I can cover the table and now even have to worry about baby touching. My only complaint and it won't even cost it a star is that I like to wrap the topper under the table a little bit ( my baby likes to eat the table) and it has a hard time sticking firmly. Toppers have a firm stick to stay put while eating. I've even had other moms interrupt our outings to ask where I had bought these!!!
B00I6IGG1A|5|Love!
B008KG5R6I|5|I have purchased several of these and they are great.  My daughter is still using the one I purchased when her 2-year-old was born.  I have purchased one as a gift and I now own one myself as they are doing heavy construction near my property very early in the morning.  I could have ordered an &#34;adult&#34; sound machine, but this works so well with must background noise and since I knew its quality, it just made sense.
B0013P7WXO|5|This has been the best product that I could find for my teething baby. When she used other teething products, she would end up biting the inside of her mouth. I live in Australia now and I can't find these anywhere. Everyone is always asking me where they  can get purchase one. This is a great product.
B00ECCLC8Q|4|This is very cute and adorable. I bought it for my son. The only thing that I wish was different is that maybe the lids had hinges on them so they wouldn't come off. This is either going to have to sit up on display high somewhere so no one can mess with it or it's just can have to stay in the box after I put the items into it. Other than that I love it
B0011URFRE|3|Crotch strap too tight and small! The 5 point harness is supposed to fit up to 65 pounds. My daughter is only 35 pounds and even in shorts, the crotch strap is so tight, Its almost hard to do without pinching her leg.  I don't see how its going to fit in the winter with heavy pants and snow suits.  She is not big enough for the seat belt yet so not sure what to do.  They should make crotch extenders.  Once she gets big enough to use it with a regular seat belt, it might be okay.
B001T9OAE8|5|This is not a high tech product. It is simple, cute, comfortable and functional. I have tried MANY sleep sacks and I think that this one is my favorite, priced high or low.<br />I didn't like the Halo sleep sack as the zipper broke on mine, and while the fleece was soft on the OUTSIDE of the sack, the inside was pill-y and not pleasant. I had another - the Kiddopotumus, that had a dangerously wide neck opening and the velcro fasteners at the shoulders were stiff and rubbed baby's face.<br /><br />This sleep sack is just right. The neck opening is small which makes it safe for a small baby (so they don't wiggle down into the sack and get it over their face - and some babies are squirmers!). The material is a wonderful cotton-poly fleece which has a much nicer feel and movement to it than 100% polyester. it is soft and more breathable while being nice and cozy.<br /><br />The styling is very simple, but cut, too. Seeing my two-month old all cuddly in this is the sweetest thing! Before using this I am not sure I would have spent the money for a higher end sleep sack like this. Now that I have one, I would consider buying another and this would absolutely make a wonderful baby gift.
B0078MQEEO|2|Very hard to install in ground this not super soft. Doesn't stay up or tight well at all. Very frustrating
B000056JND|5|My baby is almost 3weeks old, and is a breastfed baby. We use the bottles to feed him when we go out somewhere or leave him with my mother for a few hours. He has no problems using these bottles. He has no problems with gas or nipple confusion. So far these bottles are working great. The avent system works well with the pump and all the little storage containers. I would recommend it.
B00171WXII|5|My newborn has a terrible cold, I tried all the suction bulbs with no success, purchased this and within a minute he's breathing nicely with no congestion!!! amazing!!!
B008VWB04O|5|love it, cute, adorable, plush and perfect for any nursery
B001UFJTTW|1|I purchased this yesterday (before I read all the terrible reviews here) and got home to take my daughter's temperature to find the \\"long-life battery\\" it promised was dead before we even had a chance to use it. I have emailed the manufacturer and hope to have a swift response and battery replacement, but by the sounds of it, even if I get a replacement battery, the readings won't be accurate anyway. I guess we will find out. Definitely not happy so far.
B002PXBDMY|5|Loved it!!! We have concrete floors so this is the perfect spot to keep toys and to lay down the baby when we need too.  We travel with it everywhere - just nice to always have a comfortable spot for our baby to play
B00OOH72CY|5|My daughter absolutely loves this.  I have seen each one of these seperately but never all together like this one.  It arrived on time and packaged properly.
B002WB2GAM|4|I was looking for a little lightweight stroller that would fit my very tiny little 17 month old daughter. I was tired of the bulky travel system we had. So, I ordered this. It came very fast, it is more of a wine color that red. The adjustable hood, DOESN'T adjust! That and getting in the bottom part is a little hard are the only cons to buying this. But the pro is that it fits in my toyota corolla trunk, it's easy to walk with, it's comfortable for my 6'3\\" tall husband to push around, and my daughter seems to be comfortable in it. All in all, I think that if you are looking for just a quick easy stroller, I would recommend this one.
B005XIY7MG|5|very cute and very soft.Grandson is going to love this.I expected to get and Eiffel tower because you show one in the pic. but the mouse and blanket are very soft.
B000067QMJ|2|I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that's had this problem with this potty! We bought this over a year ago for our son to try to potty train him before he was 2. He was absolutely amazed at the music when he went (even though it didn't always go when it was supposed to and sometimes went when it shouldn't)  and always wanted to \\"go potty.\\" Unfortunately, he eventually tired of it and was no longer \\"thrilled\\" at the music. My biggest complaint, however, is that it leaks! What good is a potty chair that won't hold the contents?!?!? Somewhere between the guard and the bowl itself there's obviously not a tight enough fit. I would've thought they would've tested this kind of thing before it was ever put on the market! Don't waste your money on this one.
B000I2MRLK|5|I ordered this for a Christmas gift.  Came very quickly and he is really cute.  I have no clue how the baby will like it but it seems well made.
B001L2SA6M|4|My baby will only take these and the avent soothies. I love that these come with a cap and can be thrown in the diaper bag without a second thought.
B0045I6IA4|5|Love the pink and purple!
B004G8QN6M|5|I love the HALO SleepSack I can sleep well, knowing that my baby is safe. It is perfect for a 7 month old.
B009279HL0|5|The micro fleece is soft, keeps baby warm and the tuxedo top makes it adorable. The sleepsack also washes very well.
B007DVCH6O|3|The magnets to close it do not work well at all. The top just flaps around. The shoulder pad does not stay in place either. I had to sew on my own velco tab to close it and keep the shoulder pad in place. Otherwise great.
B00COEOJXY|5|Super cute!
B007LXSNP8|2|Was folded and wouldn't stick to wall
B002QYW8LW|5|My baby LOVES this toothbrush. She uses it mostly as a teether. She is 7 mos and has 2 teeth and no part have been bitten off...yet. It is very easy for her to hold and fun because it looks like she is eating a banana :)
B001DK8CFG|5|We love these booster seat.  The one we purchased over 2 years ago is still going strong no issues, so we go another when our youngest was ready to use one.<br /><br />Sometimes it is hard to clean down in the cracks when still attached to the chair, but removing it is easy which allows for simple cleanup.
B000067EH7|5|My son is going to be 4 months old soon and he is VERY small but very active. I registered for this tub because its cheaper, and much smaller than the other famous Euro Tub. I love this tub and do not regret my purchase. My son fits well in it and it fits securly in my double sink, making it much more comfortable for me to bathe him. I dont think that the tub \\"grips\\" so well but I just put one of those cheep baby towels under him. There is a space for his shampoos and soaps so I dont have to get the counter as wet. My son loves being in it and i dont expect him to outgrow it until around a year old! I also like that the water actually covers him and hes not soo cold (hes a winter baby). I drains really easily, but we always leave it upside-down on a separate dishrack and store it in the bottom of a sink. I dont see how anyone could find this too big, all infant tubs are and the folding ones really dont work. I love this tub and it makes bathtime fun for me and my very lively son.
B002SNAK6G|5|If you want something to try on, check the store first if it will work for your family...this chair works for us that's why I think its a best investment. We travel a lot and this chair is better than a high chair.  Our kiddos don't like booster seats that attached to chairs and we don't use glass or tables with sleeves under (When we are in a restaurant, we make sure the table they have don't have glass or we asked for one that does not have or simply ask for a booth).  It's so easy to take, fold, stow, travel, clean, and my child is sitting next to us and learning table manners (our own way).  I like the attached bag to cover for travel or store, which is handy.  The back has a nice pouch for putting a bib or a teether or wipes or even a disposable place mat.  We've been around the world and cruises with this one and with three boys, this far is our most hygienic chair.
B00UO6DDVS|5|Just got this yesterday and it is already in my car. I love it!! I pretty much live in my car, driving all day, so this is going to help me out soooo much. Thank you for making this product!! Also great packaging BTW!! Lori :-)
B00S0MVB9E|1|These did not work for my style of cabinets and attaching it to the lower portion proved to be a pain. You were expected to cut out a measuring piece that was printed on the other side of the directions which prevented you from being able to read the full directions. The magnet was not strong enough to work flawlessly through the thickness of my cabinet door. The 3M tape was strong.
B006ZCEVGQ|5|I liked the product very much. It's practical and simple to use. My only complaint is that the car seat came in a different color than ordered.
B001AMR690|5|This stool is just the right size for my toddler to climb up into bed. she loves the little storage compartment.
B00DUTKBSE|1|While this bottle warmer may work for glass bottles, it is definitely too hot for liner insert systems.  In order to use this unit at all with these, you must put in no more than a teaspoon of water and watch it closely.  It is very easy to get the milk way too hot with the danger of burning baby's mouth!  I would suggest that the company put some kind of warning of this danger as I practically boiled the first few bottles before I caught on to the problem.  So it works, I guess, but watch your water level.
B007CTPWXW|5|Excellent
B0081JWWW6|5|Wonderful!!! Arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting and it was at a way better cost that I could find any where.
B003PIJIP2|2|The inside of the bag is too small, not wide enough for my packing needs. I like the idea of the many outside pockets, but could not bring myself to keep the bag based on just the outside.  Also, the bag zips open/close by a double zipper panel...not easy to get in or out of.
B00A1M9S9G|5|Ordered this for our beach vacation, it arrived quickly and was put to use immediately! So easy to open and close, easy to clean. We keep this in the car and grab it for visiting friends, soccer games, picnics, beach... it goes everywhere! Everyone that sees it is asking where they can get one!!
B00474CUTO|1|I bought this pillow when I was 6 months pregnant with twins.  I thought it might help provide support for my bump while sleeping.  This things flattens out thinner than a pancake.  You would get the same result as this pillow by folding up a towel to place under your belly.  I do not recommend this product.
B00IHAJCJU|4|Good quality and perfect condition on delivery. Item was as it was described and installation in car was straight forward. Tested it on long travel from Houston to Destin and back. Did not observed to be uncomfortable as daughter liked it and slept well during the trip. Having a cup holder is pretty neat for storing drink. If I had a choice again I would go for this one.
B004XYT1HC|5|ESTOY MUY CONTENTO CON ESTE PRODUCTO, COMO CON TODO LO DE hello kitty ES MUY BUENO Y A MUY BUEN PRECIO, RECOMENDACION PARA TODOS
B00FPGAQWQ|5|This carrier is lightweight and easy to use on your back or to carry your child in front. My granddaughter loves it!!
B001AZKWA2|5|The baby loves this blankie, and she's no longer tripping on her crib blanket!
B004S8MGHU|5|This is a must have if you are pumping. Works perfectly. Frees up your hands. I keep one at home and one at work.
B000E9T8GO|1|I ordered this dog gate on January 1, 2009.   I have not received it, the 1-800 number that they gave me is never answered,   I have placed innumerable telephone calls to them only to receive voice mail in reply and they never anser my telephone calls.   I will NEVER order from this merchant again.
B004LC77JK|5|Great crib sheets. Wanted to do tinkerbell theme and this is the only place I could find crib sheets with tinkerbell and they look great!
B005PK1G76|5|A must have.  I just bought a Baby Jogger City mini Single and it fits perfect.  The price is great.
B000V9DXGS|3|its a bit too big for my microwave so it does not rotate. should have measured micro before hand
B002T44LFK|5|Well made and very cute. This is a 'must have' if you go shopping, to theme parks or walks along the beach. Every child would love this too.
B000GIBZ64|1|It was a bad idea to give this pillow a static shape. it is always like this and it is uncomfortable for baby to sleep with it - i though it is just shaped like this on photo but it is actually always like this. (((
B005BEKUX2|5|This was one of our favorite in our stash. It never leaked (double gussets) and the snaps with adjustable rise meant that we were able to use it until our son was completely potty trained.<br /><br />We were able to use this diaper from about 9 months- to 21 months (when he was trained)
B00AGJFNCA|5|Got this for my wife's SUV, and it sees all. It take a little while to get use to but one you do, you see everything, the baby in the car seat, the dog in the back , and the random car that might have been in a blind spot before.
B00CDJD28I|4|Got this for a friend and her 9 month old loved the little caterpillar squirted! It really helped him.practice his Pinter grasp
B00B406UO0|5|Excelente
B000HZI1R2|4|I love this pillow. I also have a Boppy, which doesn't work well for nursing. The Boppy is rounded in the middle and isn't very tight (or adjustable), so the baby rolls into me - not helpful when I'm trying to keep him close. Especially early on when most moms are very sore, you don't want the baby to move around too much once he's latched on. It is adjustable with velcro, which is very loud, so don't do it when your baby is right there if he's sensitive to noise. Once the velcro is in the right place, there's a plastic clip so you can get it on and off easily. The only complaint I have is that I had to buy a new cover because the old one shrank after I washed it. I dried it partway (still quite damp) and then hung it up, but it shrank so much that I had to buy a new one. Even with a cover that fits, it's a total pain to get it back on. But other than that, it's a great pillow.
B001NIFOJA|3|One size is way too small, but the next is too big.  If it would fit correctly, I would absolutely love it.
B0018OHCLC|5|I use these spoons daily and never use my other ones- Nuby brand. I originally liked the price for the amount, and then after using them this is the only spoon I use. My son just started eating solids, and what makes the spoon best for him is how shallow the spoon is. My other spoons were too deep and when you put the spoon with food into the baby's mouth,  he was unable to get the food off of the spoon. These work really well and are a nice small size for travelling as well.
B00ESXTNQ2|3|the rubber part on the lower portion is small and it scared me because my daughter took it off and i didn't want her to choke on it.  it isn't so small, but scary enough that i threw it away.  so we never used it for the purpose of keeping her hands warm while chewing on the icy teether.
B00IHJPGMI|5|Love our new 'le swipes'!!  Great patterns for boys and they are great for quick clean ups!  A perfect baby shower gift for a new mom.
B001OBDKJW|3|We have had this gate installed in our home for over a year now and at first it was great! it opened and closed really easily and was wide enough to easily fit through while carrying a load of stuff.  but now our gate door keeps falling off, we have to continually retighten the hardware so the door stays on and the gate has started to stick and is difficult to open.
B000YCSH40|5|I have twins and LOVE these bath seats! The seats make bath time so much more fun for my 10 month old infants who want to sit up in the big tub but need a little support around them.
B00B5CBIBW|3|We and our son love the Tommee Tippee bottles, they are very natural to a real nipple.  But we are tired of having to buy these replacement nipples which don't come with the required ring to attach it to the bottle.  I don't want to buy more bottles, just more nipples!
B001JEQ3L6|5|I stumbled upon this when I was babysitting my baby cousin. I thought it was a neck pillow, and it was amazingly comfortable! Later my Dr ordered me to start sleeping with only a rounded or contoured pillow, and that the Boppy would be fine. Now, ever since I broke my neck two years ago, for the first time I actually get a great and full night's sleep. The Boppy pillow is soft, and is perfect for side sleepers. I also ordered a blissfully soft slip cover to make it a little more cozy, and it is just a miracle. I no longer toss and turn, and my husband says I don't even snore anymore. Even though I don't use it for what it was intended, the Boppy is amazing. If you have neck problems or even just aches or can't get comfortable, BUY A BOPPY it will change your life!
B0028OT7G4|5|This is a great diaper bag and it is reasonably priced. It fits everything I need. Extra clothes, diapers, bottles, formula, burp rags, binkies, blanket, and even my wallet and organizer so I don't have to carry a purse. Not too girly looking so my boyfriend doesn't mind carrying it out in public. I would recommend this to a friend!
B00N4OODY8|5|I love these so much! They fit my 21lbs one year old great.
B006ZISVF2|2|I got this because I though it was cute and like the safety of it. However, the belt support system is waaaayyyy too short! My two month old is 13lbs 25 inches tall and I have hell getting him in the carseat!
B0081A218K|3|Small
B002MKOWUK|5|And it washes well. My grandson and his parents liked this towel so much we had to order two sizes so he would have one for now and one to grow into.
B002DE7APO|5|We were a little skeptical about some of the reviews but we ordered this anyway and were very happy! It is easy to open and close...just email the company and they give you a link on utube which shows how to open and close. It is a SNAP!!!
B0038JDLTW|5|I've tried and tried to swaddle my babies with the plain blankets we took home from the hospital.  Try as I might, I can't seem to get it as snug or locked into place like the nursery nurses could.  With this, just wrap, velco, and Volia! Both of our daughters loved these things. Use them a couple times then throw them in the washer.  So easy even this guy could do it!
B00007C65S|2|So far, I am not too impressed with this warmer.  Using the exact amount of water suggested with the level, I find that the Avent 4-oz bottle of breast milk is still COLD.  However, scalding water drips off the bottle as I pull it out of the warmer (be careful not to burn yourself!).  I plan on trying different amounts of water to see if I can get the right ratio - but for something that is supposed to be a help, it is just creating more work for me...thankfully, Peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side.
B00NFY534Q|5|We use these bibs with our newborn because she is a messy bottle feeder. The cotton is really soft and absorbent and the under side is fleece and keeps the moisture away from her clothes. They have held up nicely in the wash. I thinking about buying another set!
B00AJSIQCW|4|Works great for second car seat. Doesn't feel as sturdy as my britax but we use it in grandparents cars
B003OBYTOU|5|As a die hard ownder of a Phil & Teds Sport (its 6yrs old and has carried 4 kids!), we were looking for something to use daily to retire the P&T for jogging only as its gotten a bit worn out. We decided on the Britax B Ready. Ordered the doubles seat from Amazon on a Sunday and it arrived Tuesday morning! When I opened the box, I gasped at how gorgeous the color is on the Green...very rich. The seat feels very solid, nicely padded and roomy. We didn't get the main stroller part yet so haven't \\"used\\" it yet but really it feels nice. I had our almost 3 yr old sit in it and he was very comfy. I like the 5 point harness and the fact that a kid can't unbuckle it (as toddlers like to do).   Overall- SO impressed with the shipping speed and the color of this is stunning.
B00067IYXW|1|As other reviews have stated, each container (2/box) will only hold 6-4 ounce milk bags.  The containers are expensive and not at all worth the money.
B00JXNE0P6|4|Excellent product
B0049OO3F6|4|My son loves the silverware!  We don't use  the plate as much because with the silverware sitting on it, the sections are a little small.  Quality of the entire set is excellent!
B005EET6H0|2|Packaging was horrible.  When bed arrived, the box was completely open - parts and hardware were loose all throughout the packaging.  Luckily, all the hardware was found in the damaged box.  The bed had on dent/scratch in the left side frame - right along the top.  The produce is ok, but not as nice as displayed.
B009UPUB5K|5|Nice
B004NISGUG|5|😄
B000096M59|5|Love these cups - the covers stay on nicely.
B00JGNYGHU|5|Love love love this!!!!! Looks exactly how it does in photos maybe even better in person.
B002TOKEM4|5|We love this diaper stuffed with 2+ hemp inserts for bedtime with my heavy wetter.  This diaper paired with a wool cover is bulletproof for our toddler through the night!!  I looked for something for a long time for nighttime for a heavy wetter and found it with this!!  recommend to anyone that has issues with leaks around the legs too.
B001J1Z8VK|3|I received the stroller Yesterday. Before I put it all together I had my 2,5 year old son sit in it for a fitting. He is too tall for the seat. There is a cover directly above the seat and his head does not fit under it. Not even close. You cannot really tell the cover is there from the picture and it is not mentioned in the description (it is the black trim above the seat). And I have to send the stroller back.
B000ROMFCU|2|This sheet is VERY thin! Baby spit up leaks right through it and hardly protects the pack n play insert.  I am not happy with this product.  If the baby hadn't already spit up on it I would send it back.  VERY disappointed!! It also didn't even ship for over a month which is silly.  I pay for 2 day delivery
B004HM35Y0|5|This is such a simple thing yet it makes all the sense in the world..very useful and practical, best $5 I've spent!  If your shower has a hose then you probably won't need this since it is much easier to just use the hose to rinse the soap and shampoo but if you just have a tub like me, then this thing would make bathing your baby so much easier.  The handle makes it so easy to use and I like that it is soft and pliable so you can scoop the water from anywhere there is space in the tub (and makes it baby safe!).  I have a 7 month old baby who can't stay still, she would stand and try to climb out of the tub, move and turn around, reach for and grab everything around her..this thing has been so helpful in helping me keep up with her, rinsing with one hand while holding her steady with the other.  I initially thought of just using a plastic mug but this is way better..not even comparable!
B00H3KWJ4U|5|I really like these containers.  They are simple, convenient and easy to clean.  Just what I expected them to be based on the description online.  I like the fact that they can fit in the bottle warmer although I rarely warm up the food in these. I was somewhat unsure whether they will be able to close well without leakage but so far I'm pleased with their performance.  They click (no screw) and really hold the content well.  Haven't seen any staining!  If I could wish anything is to have these in an 8-10 oz size as sometimes I find them too small if I want to mix in cheese or egg yolk into the pureed veggies.
B002MN3JY2|3|I leak right through these. They are good in theory but right now with a three month old my let down is too hard and strong for these. I'll try them again when baby is a little bigger.
B0090WXRJA|4|I will say this is a great item.  I did not want to drill holes in my banister posts for a baby gate.  The baby gate I wanted to install actually had a no drill banister mounting option but it just used zip ties around the posts.  While that is fine around the round part I know the zip ties would have rounded off the square part of my post when they were tightened.  I have the same posts pictured with the item.  These worked great at the bottom square part and at the top where it is rounded under the hand rail using the supplied adapters.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the wood mounting surface that comes with it is unfinished and was too thin for my application.  The boards are 1 1/2 inches wide.  My gate used hooks that required a mounting surface of at least 2 1/2 inches.  So I purchased at 1x4 oak board, cut it to required length, sanded it, stained it, and mounted my gate to them instead.  Had to do a little extra work but this product for the most part was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I uploaded a pic of my application showing the wider board I used.
B0000YGM9Y|5|Loves to take it apart, play with the balls by shaking them or hitting them together.  I can see this toy lasting a while, looking forward to when he figures out he can toss the ball back in the top for music and lights!
B0010B3WFS|4|I was looking for a stroller that I could use in the mall. I also wanted something to go walking with on local trails. We ended up getting this one because it seemed to have everything I wanted without the big $ tag.     Pros & cons  *The shade- The huge shade cover is great. I know someone said theirs didn't move forward all the way but ours does. No problems with ours.   *Storage basket- I like the nice size storage basket underneath. The only drawback is that it can be a little awkward to reach it but I can get a lot to fit in it.   *The front wheel hand lock/release- I like it though I don't use it a lot since I don't jog with it.  *Folding- No problems with folding it. It's a little bulky but if you open up the tray it folds better. We have a minivan and it fits fine in the back.     Our main use for this stroller is walking. We walk paved (but not smooth) trails all the time and my daughter can fall asleep in the stroller no problem. We love it and have been using a lot since we got it nearly 4 months ago.
B00003TL7P|4|As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.
B00A3F3RN4|5|The pillow is working so well! I am so happy to not have to stuff pillows all around me (to then have them pop out while I'm sleeping). In the third trimester it has really been nice for my back.
B00CWN8IK2|5|Easy to care for.  Lightweight.  Gives a steady, fine mist.  Doesn't take up much space.  Easy to clean.  And dependable.
B00BLVQIMG|3|This is going to be the third one we will have bought..  They are convenient and work well.  But break with normal use.  When setting the diaper inside, i found the system doesnt close very well unless you push the diaper down a bit.  Doing this breaks one of the plastic pegs on the jaws inside.  so we are averaging about 5 months out of it at this rate.  It lasts for quite a few diapers, just not our day to day force.
B00E1CI5X2|5|Technology continues to improve every aspect of life and this monitor makes a great addition to your nursery and your pease of mind.  The camera and monitor works great and it is simple to set up.  The only negative I might give it is the price.  With all the cost of setting up a nursery this monitor is not going to be affordable, but it would make a great gift from future grandparents.  I can't add much that other reviewers have already mentioned, but it is high tech, has a small footprint, and works.  Definitely gives you some peace of mind.
B000P9D5MG|1|I ordered the fleece crib blanket (pink)for a diaper cake I was making for a baby shower gift. Receive Monday April 15, 2013. The baby shower on April 20, 2013 no time to return the blanket. This was my first order from Amazon and my last.I could not believe how dirty this baby blanket was. Came in a USPS box with no packaging just the blanket in a box. I have never seen anything shipped that way that was suppose to be new in my life. The blanket was from Wolfmark.[[ASIN:B000XQD5BM Fleece Crib Blankets]]
B00ANG3L2U|5|Best bibs ever!  Easy to clean, dries quickly, machine washable
B004F95G1A|5|this necklace is awesome . I have never used this before on any of my kids until this baby. I highly recommend it.
B00AOFZKAG|5|Works great, won't spill
B000BNQC58|5|Seriously fantastic.  It is like having those glow in the dark stars on your ceiling but removable. Provides a soft glow of night sky on the ceiling; just enough of a night light for our toddler (and for us if we need to go in there) & it looks plain cool.  I am just so happy with this purchase!
B005ZBI04M|4|It works as described, they need to make one for elongated bowls, but otherwise PERFECT. color is a little more purple then pink too, if you are trying to match decor
B00021LXT4|5|I've been using the Double-Action stretch mark cream since the beginning of my second month. I started showing early and the stretch marks came with that. My doctor explained that if you have had extreme weight loss or gain in the past then your body will remember that and you will tend to gain weight in those places first.  So I was destined to get stretch marks no matter what I did. The reasons why I still recommend this cream is because it is the only thing that was able to stop my itching tummy without further irritating my already sensitive skin. It has also diminished the color of the stretch marks.  And now that I'm in my 34th week, the stretch marks have stretched beyond capacity and are breaking open and this cream still seems to be fighting to add elasticity where there isn't any. This product is well worth the money even if you get stretch marks.
B00O3JERJY|5|I love it
B004T8NRPE|5|Best cleaning tools for people with kids...and I've even used these on some non-kid items.
B00FLXBFAK|5|Good quality, nice craftsmanship.
B00005C0T8|4|I bought this for me and the wife to use washing our baby's bottles and my wife's breast pump and supplies.  It's built well - very sturdy - and has held up really well.  The bristles are very soft and mold to reach all the nooks and crannies of the bottles.  The tip of the other end can get up into the ends of the nipples to clean them out as well.  Is it wrong that I feel funny using the word nipple in a review?  :-)<br /><br />Anyway, the brush works so well my wife asked me to buy another one for her to take to work.  She uses it there to clean the breast pump machine and supplies when she pumps at the office.<br /><br />We're happy with the performance so far - if anything changes I will make an update...
B005J58CV0|3|My baby only liked it for a couple of weeks, lost interest in it after that
B004LT5330|4|As expected with any BOB product.<br /><br />Works well, solid construction at a premium price.<br /><br />I love the stroller but all the accessories are pricey.
B00JEDHAL6|5|We took this stroller to Disneyland (from NYC)... we have two children and it really not only handled like a dream but the fold out standing board gave my son a break from time to time and since it comes with the added sun shade my daughter sleep like a dream while she waited for her big brother to get done with the rides.<br /><br />The weight is what you'd expect for a stroller of this size.<br /><br />Once you learn how to fold out the kickboard it'll only take a few times to learn and then it'll become muscle memory.<br /><br />Great stroller I highly recommend it!
B004KEB5C4|5|These blankets are fabulous for swaddling our one month old daughter.  She sleeps better when swaddled, so I needed a lightweight blanket because it is so hot in Phoenix.  These fit the bill.  They are also large and stretchy (about 36x40 inches before stretching). Other swaddle blankets have stopped fitting her, but these still stretch over her long legs.  They wash well and stay soft.  After purchasing one set, I came back and purchased three more.  A must have!
B00AK5ADDE|4|a gift
B004J34TCO|5|excellent product, thank you very much
B004B762AK|2|Let me start by saying that I am a caring husband and father.  I am writing this review because I would like to help others avoid the same stresses that my poor wife and I have endured as a result of the poor performance of this product.<br /><br />We have suffered with the Baby Touch for several months and are now in the process of replacing it with a different product.  Let me be clear: when the Baby Touch works, it works well.  The camera & monitor produce a nice image, and the sound alarm works nicely.  It is also very easy to use and configure.  The unit is made of a cheap plastic material, but I suspect that is fairly common across all competing products.<br /><br />The real problem with the Baby Touch is range.  We CONSTANTLY lose signal on one or both of the cameras and we are well within the stated range.  In fact, we will often lose signal even walking out of one of our kids' bedrooms.  It has been the cause of significant stress for us as we are constantly concerned that we'll lose signal in the middle of the night and not be alerted to a problem.  We have replaced and re-synced cameras multiple times to no avail.  I don't know what wireless technology this unit depends on, but it is highly suspect and very unreliable.<br /><br />That brings me to the second major problem with this unit: customer service.  I tried contacting Summer Infant hoping that there may be some way to correct the issue, and was greeted with a 20+ minute hold time in the middle of a business day.  When someone finally picked up, she was rude and condescending.  The customer service agent came to the conclusion that I needed to replace the same camera that I had already replaced, and could offer no other suggestion as to why we were having range issues.  I realize that this isn't the most expensive camera on the market, but it was costly enough that I would have anticipated more friendly and helpful support.<br /><br />To those that are considering this camera, I would strongly suggest you proceed with caution particularly if you expect this camera to work flawlessly in a two-camera configuration or wish to use it over a wide physical range.  Anyone with a larger home should investigate other options.  And for those of you that value prompt, friendly and helpful technical support, you may want to stay clear of Summer Infant.
B006YPTZRO|2|I loved this sippy when we got it two weeks ago. finally a sippy my daughter could use and liked carrying around. It didn't leak, worked great. i couldn't figure out why it was round, but hey she liked it.<br /><br />then i started noticing puddles all over the floors. i couldn't figure out where the thing was leaking from, because every time i tried it wouldn't leak. then i set it down one time and noticed that, while sitting standing straight up, the liquid was pouring from the top. somehow the pressure from the seal is pushing out the liquid.<br /><br />I still let my daughter use the cup but basically can only fill it enough for her to drink and finish (though, as others have mentioned the straw doesn't move with the liquid and so we always end up with a little at the bottom).
B00DSIBQE0|2|Too small, never used it.
B00368CLXW|5|Bought this to protect the leather seats in our car from the child safety seat.  So far it has done its job.  We have been using it for 1 month.
B005P4R4CS|2|Crib arrived broken
B0048SOBGO|3|I thought the labels would stick better on bottles. Bottles are washed everyday. Labels beginning to come loose. any Suggestions?
B0009QYTIY|5|We received a SwaddleMe as a gift at the hospital.  I wasn't sure if I'd use it--we didn't have one of these with my first daughter and she slept fine.  Well, our newest addition turned out to not be the best sleeper.  We swaddled her with blankets to start, and then I remembered the SwaddleMe and pulled it out.  Once we got the hang of it, we swaddled that baby every night.  She slept great!  As she grew, I wondered what we would do about the swaddling because it was just not fitting that well anymore.  I didn't realize that they made a larger size until I found it here on Amazon.  I purchased two of the large sizes (my daughter is now almost 4 mos old), and they've been great.  I love the micofleece because it's so cozy.  The cotton knit one stretches more and she tends to get her arms loose easily in that one.  The BEST gift for new moms and yourself if you need some sleep!
B003IHVHL8|4|I give these four stars because they're quite solid, big, high, and I could just barely get them on my Graco Snap 'N Go stroller handle bar.  You need to peel back the foam padding on the stroller bar in order to get this baby to clamp on.      Minus one star because it JUST barely clamped on.  They could have made it a tad bigger and included some cushioning foam piece to pad it in case some stroller handles are too thin.    I recommend!
B0009T2CB2|4|I thought this monitor wasn't bad for price.  The great point is that I can hear my baby breathing which comforts me.  My monitor is sitting about 6 feet away from the crib.  I had this monitor for 1.5 years and have been generally happy with it.  As far as the static goes, it does have static at times, you can move it in a different spot to lessen or make it go away.  When your cell phone rings, it'll make the receiver buzz.  I just make sure my phone is not sitting next to the receiver.  The Lights on the receiver light up when your baby makes noises.  I can take it outside, but not very far.  The further away from the house the more static.  I am planning on buying another monitor like this one if I can find it for the $19 price I originally bought it for.  Hope this helps you.
B000IDSLOG|5|This toy is a great teether for any infant. It is easy for babies to hold. My son loves playing with it
B004HZEYMO|5|They were perfect. Fit my six and four years olds perfect. They were the talk of the party. Shipped fast, packaged right, and good quality.
B004FN9YQ4|3|I really liked this seat when I first tried it with baby girl.  She seemed to enjoy it.  A few uses later, she arched her back enough that her legs became free and she almost toppled backwards.  Because I was next to her on the floor, I was able to prevent an accident.  Using the tray didn't improve the situation.  So, for babies who sit nicely and are well-supervised, this is a nice seat.  For babies like mine, there are other options.  (I recently traded in my Bumbo for a competitor's seat that comes with a seat belt, wider leg openings, and a pair of straps to all the seat to be used on a chair as well as a standalone seat on the floor.  It still requires supervision, but it works better for our little one.)
B00AEA8K4Y|1|I bought this for my granddaughter.  My daughter says it never worked from the time they received it.  Very disappointing!
B0011H804O|5|Easy, beautiful way to make giftable keepsakes for family. Makes two easily if you roll it thin enough and use a smaller circle.
B000O8UGUM|3|these are liners, NOT inserts.  thin, must be doubled.
B006SFUDQM|2|Does not fit very snug on spout. My kid keeps pulling it forward. Atleast it does stay over the sharp end I was worried about.
B003AOLKJS|1|I am still searching for a good nasal aspirator, and this is not it.  I couldn't get ANYTHING out of my baby's nose using this bulb.  The hole is too small and the rubber is too stiff.  I can't believe this product is still on the market.
B00FXR5S20|5|Makes washing hair easier and fun for granddaughter.
B000G7TIZA|5|I think this is a great product.  Soft, but not too soft that she sinks in.  I like the curve it has too.
B008818LRW|2|At first it was very nice, easy packing of the sandwiches, vegetables and fruits.<br />You really must clean this every day and it should get dry before using it the next day, so it was quite a hassle.<br />After about two weeks the bag (actually the fabric outline) started showing dots of mold.<br />I did my best keeping it dried everyday but I guess it was not enough.<br />Won't be buying more of those.
B00AV53YP2|5|Best Baby bottle we have ever had.<br />We bought these with out 3rd child and have loved them! The bottle design is simple and clean, which I appreciate.<br />As far as use goes, the bottles are great. Our baby has not had any gas or colic, thanks to the vented nipples, and the stainless steel makes the bottles very easy to heat. Once you mix your formula or insert the breastmilk, simply run hot water over the outside of the bottle for 10 second increments. Stop to feel the temp of the bottle. Once the outside temp of the bottle is a temp that you feel is appropriate and safe, your done. The inside contents will match the temp of the outside bottle. If it has been refrigerated, shake the contents after running the hot water over it and the outside will adjust to the inside temp of the contents. It's so easy.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is this bottle doesn't accumulate any residue like our Dr. Browns, and other plastic bottles did.<br /><br />The only con that i can tell you is that if you wash it in a dishwasher the painted areas will wear off quicker than if you hand wash. We have had ours for almost 4 months and the paint is still intact, but we mostly hand wash them.
B000056OV0|5|My son is 5 months old and i just switched from the 4 in one stage (really 2 in one)bath (horrible tub)...but already with this tub my son is comfortable and splashes around for the first time..my both hands are finally free to bathe him...yes its big but its worth it...when i wash him he lays down. with all those curves he does not move around..then I will sit him up for fun time and he just has a ball..absoulutely recommend this bath tub. I just wish I had this for the past 5 months..he will use this for a long time
B0092YYF6K|5|very pretty thanks
B0045Y15I8|5|We purchased this ottoman to match a glider and the pair are perfect in our nursery. The ottoman really helps make a smooth gliding motion when you're in the chair, so I highly recommend getting both pieces if you can.
B001VEJB18|3|I recently purchased two of these sheets, in celery and chocolate and although they both fit the mattress on the Safety 1st travel elite playard, the chocolate one is significantly larger. Maybe that's why it's 3 dollars more than the green one even though the dimensions are listed the same on the site and packaging? Overall, they are pretty good sheets for the price paid and the colors go well with my playard.
B000U404OI|5|Just as described
B0009ET49K|5|Best bottle/cup brush by far. Second time buying it.
B003QCJX0C|5|When my little 1 month old is a little fussy and different positions of holding her aren't working, and especially when I need to get stuff done around the house, I put her in the Ergo and she's perfectly content.<br /><br />Going for a walk (or a hike) with her in this didn't feel like I was carrying extra weight. My arms were free the entire time, and I could look down and see my baby cuddling with me. Nothing better than your little daughter cuddling with her dad.<br /><br />I used the Heart 2 Heart insert for a week or two, then removed it so she wouldn't be so scrunched, and so it wouldn't get so hot in there. She was still snug in the ergo, but now she had more breathing room and more air was getting through to her and me because of the slight opening in the front.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are very comfortable. So is the waist strap.<br /><br />At this point, I look for reasons to put her in the Ergo. That's how much I love it, and my little girl.
B00005JIVI|3|Good for newborns to bath in the sink, but babies will quickly outgrow it - especially when they start wiggling. I got it because it was soft and not hard plastic. My son has quickly outgrown it now that he's 4 months old. He wriggles alot now so it is tough to bath him in it. I would recommend the Euro bath, just put a towel on the bottom for newborns to make it more soft and comfy.
B00VNFU59C|5|great
B00G2G11MM|1|i have been using this wet bag for all of 3 days. My son was born 12/10 and we used disposables until the meconium passed. We switched to cloth diapers on day 3. Yesterday, day 6, I washed the contents and followed the instructions for washing the wet bag as well.<br /><br />It got all knotted on the inside of the bag. It is suctioned closed and full of water. See photos. It will not open!<br /><br />We bought 3 of these for our rotation, spending nearly $100, on a piece of garbage. I'm better off using a garbage bag!<br /><br />Keep looking!
B002YQQQJW|5|I bought these containers for my niece, who has just started making her own baby food. She absolutely loves them! She fills them up & freezes them, then in the morning takes out what she needs for the day to thaw. Making your own baby food is more economical, plus you know exacatly what is (& isn't) in it.
B0084GF4C6|3|I ordered this lids but didn't know I have to buy the straw separate. I emailed the seller and she offered me a free set of straw. I only intend to spend $20.00 for two sets but if I had to spend another $10.00 for the straws, then I will just return the lids. When I received the straws, they work, my daughter loves using it on her fruit smoothie.
B004NWMM2K|4|This works excellent for the beach. The mesh is perfect to keep the bugs out but still let the breeze through to keep baby cool. It doesn't provide much shade on its own so you would definitely need to use it under an umbrella with UV protection. Folds up small to fit in a beach bag. Dont forget to weigh it down if baby isnt inside or it will blow away. Has worked great for us.
B0018JVLE6|3|I bought this diaper bag because it looks cute and not easy to get dirty.   After I bought this bag few day later,the 2 side of pocket were broken.  I am very disappointed.
B001DSW326|5|pros:  - I like the idea that it can be used later as a chair and table. which is a big + for the reason I bought it  - Nice design, looks nice and pleasant  - Very sturdy. It mount together using a big plastic screws. I put it together in 10 minutes    cons:   - The snaps are a product of an idiot no question about it.They are very hard to buckle, watch out for baby's finger not to get stuck       in between while you are buckling.   - I wish if it's on wheels so I can move it around without dragging it on the carpet or tile.   - The tray is far away from baby, so food, toys or whatever ....,  falls between baby and tray(another idiot design by the same idiot      who design the buckles I guess)   - I wish if it has some padding on the sides. If baby cannot hold himself straight yet, he will be leaning against the side which are      bare hard plastic  despite the cons(no product can perfectly please everybody I guess), I still like the chair.
B00CSOOGXS|1|Can't get cam to work.... called customer support and received answering machine msg...&#34;will try to get back to you in a week unless you reply urgent and the 12 hrs.!&#34;  Tried e-mail and with similar answer.  Tried their web adx... msg (temp unavailable)  I have received two responses with no help in 4 days now.<br /><br />Where is customer support...... China?
B004Q7MSPI|5|This is much cuter than pictured and we get lots of compliments on it. We got dark navy room darkening curtains from target to go with & a wall decal monkey from amazon along with the matching woodn stars for this set. Our little guy loves to talk to the animals on the bumper & quilt and now says ball and points at the quilt. :)
B00000J4SP|4|We bought this for our son when he was 1 month old.  He loves it (and so do mom and dad)!! He can spend over 30 minutes playing and cooing at the toys. In fact, we were treated with his first smiles and giggles while he was playing with it. After doing much reading during pregnancy and newborn days, I wanted something that would be stimulating to our newborn.  Everything I read said that the black, white, and red colors and contrasting patterns were very stimulating to a newborn.  Our son spends quite a bit of time on his activity gym, both on his back and his tummy. I even bought the matching 3 piece accessory toys so he would have more to look at.
B0015M2HF8|1|actual color is so much darker (not cute!) than photo. also, there's not much stretch in the waistband so there's no way to tighten the shorts. and the button is fake so it's really just a short with a very wide, unadjustable waistband.
B000IDSLOG|5|Really don't let the price deter you. I purchased Sophie at Christmas of 2010 for my then 5 month old daughter and she loved it. I now have another almost 6 month old daughter and she loves Sophie even more. Sophie is still kicking a year and a half later. I purchased her at Babies R Us so she was a lot more expensive then this but I don't regret it. Word of advice DO NOT submerse Sophie in water, she WILL lose her squeak if you do. Just surface wash with a damp soapy cloth.
B005WHQKDW|5|Great
B00J942T52|4|Purchased two of these to take on a 2,300 mile trip.  They worked exactly as advertised.  Just be sure not to let the kids stand up on the foot rest.  The plastic will surely break.
B0051POJC4|5|Granddaughter loves the music.
B00CHZOECQ|4|nice set of bottles.
B00AJSIS6G|5|We just purchased this seat for our 21month year old. We wanted a seat that we could keep her rear facing longer since it's safer. We researched seats for a while before deciding. She fits very comfortably in this seat, even on a long car ride since it reclines. She is in the 70th percentile for height and still sits comfortably in the rear facing position. We are going to purchase another for my husband's car. It is a great seat for the cost.
B001G9DAIS|4|Simple, no frills, to-the-point diaper bag. Lots of great compartments and pockets to fit everything you need for an hour outing or an overnight trip. Sturdy and easy to use and very utilitarian. Great buy, great diaper bag.
B00005YYE4|5|I got my money's worth on the Boppy.  I used it for nursing my son,  then he used it during tummy time, then he used to helps support him while he learned to sit up, and now he uses it to lounge in (as he lays back and flips through a book or plays with his toys).  A great buy.    A little note -- with the \\"bare naked\\" boppy you do have to buy a boppy slip cover.  I bought 3 different ones with fun designs.  Ours would get dirty with spit-up, milk, etc.  This way I could throw slip cover in the wash every so often.  Some, boppys come in a design cover that is not removable.  I would think that these would be harder to keep clean.
B008E4WIAE|1|Did not like it.  Was not compatible with my gate and it caused the gate to pop out from the doorway.  I will not buy it again.
B00BAAX39E|5|Haven't been able to actually get my twin boys to pee but one of them does sit on it and it never shifts and seems to be comfortable. It adjusts perfectly to our elongated toilet seat.
B00290OY7O|5|this lamp went great with my daughters room! this is exactly what we were looking for and she loves it!
B00COP1VS4|4|Good product for glass tables...
B00NERYA02|5|Beautiful story and illustrations! Adorable toy.
B001VEJ2GC|4|certainly does the job.  after six months, i will say it's starting to wear out just a bit. i would recommend it.
B00005C5H4|5|A simple product amazingly designed.  I bought these for return gifts for my daughter 3rd birthday. My daughter liked it so much she spent time in stacking in series, identifying the colors.  Amazingly we didn't notice there is small fine print cut for every cup in the botoom with different shapes like hearts, triangles, circles, rectangels etc...and she started identifying those too... Satisfied wiht the buy..and very education for tht age.
B00L2FPBXS|4|I am not 100% sure how well this works but I will try anything to help ease his pain. I can see the white part of the first tooth beginning to come through and he makes it pretty well through the day with just a little hand knawing and fussing. Even with the necklace he still seems to cry an hour each night but he is probably in less pain than without the necklace.
B00AKKDSNG|4|I was torn between the Guava Family (GF) lotus crib and the Baby Bjorn (BB) travel crib. I decided to order both so that I could compare them side by side! Please bear with me as being succinct was never my forte.<br /><br />The carrying cases for both are stylish and subdued.<br /><br />For the BB crib, you can only carry it via two handles on top - much like a brief case. For the GF crib, you have two options: like a brief case or as a backpack. I like how the GF's carrying case gives you two options; however, the quality of the BB carrying case is better. The fabric is noticeably thicker and I suspect may be more durable in the long run if you're rough with your baby gear.<br /><br />The set up design of both cribs is instinctive.<br /><br />I was able to set both up without reading the owner's manual. For the GF crib, the mattress pad is secured via velcro tabs located underneath the pad. You pull the tabs through slots on the bottom of the crib and secure it to velcro tabs there. I was able to do all four velcro tabs just by touch. There's a bit of fumbling but I don't think that necessarily detracts from the ease of set up. I noticed that the mattress pad did pull up at four corners initially, but after a few days it now lays relatively flat.<br /><br />The BB mattress pad is secured via red tabs pulled through corner slots of the crib. They're anchored with a hook-loop mechanism instead of velcro. It was admittedly easier and faster to anchor the BB mattress than it was the GF mattress because I could see what I was doing. The BB mattress pad also initially pulled up at all four corners and is now settling down and laying flat. Neither crib had any discernible odor upon set up.<br /><br />As for the mattress pad, I'd say the BB mattress is double the thickness of the GF mattress. You can order a plush quilted sheet to make the GF mattress softer. I personally prefer the more plush mattress as my child is 15 months; however, I could also see why others would prefer the thinness of the GF mattress. I'd say it's akin to any typical Graco pack'n'play mattress. We have the American Baby Company 100% organic cotton interlock fitted pack'n'play sheet and it fit fine on both mattress pads.<br /><br />I feel that overall, the quality of material is noticeably different. The fabric at the top of the GF crib is not as smooth and luxe to the touch as the BB one is. One review noted that they felt like the former fabric could potentially snag more and I can see that happening. The top fabric parts of both cribs can be zippered off and washed. The mesh material of both feel exactly the same.<br /><br />To take down the GF crib, there are two handles on the top part of the frame that you simply squeeze. The location of the handles is indicated by white circles with upward arrows. For the BB crib, you tug the legs down and fold.<br /><br />Because the GF crib is shaped like a box, its footprint is larger than that of the BB crib. The legs of the GF also stick out further than the BB crib's legs. They're both roughly the same height. In terms of aesthetic appeal, I'd go with the BB crib. It's sleeker and I prefer the all black look versus the grey, white, and black of the GF crib.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about the GF crib was the side zipper. My toddler had a blast running in and out of it and I felt like it just made the crib more fun and accessible to her. I even thew a blanket over the top of the GF crib and it became a wonderful little fort. I think it'd also be great for families who are into the Montessori method of floor beds. My child's a light sleeper so the side zipper wouldn't be useful in terms of nursing before a nap because the zipping the flap would just wake her up.<br /><br />I didn't feel like the side zipper was beneficial in placing the child in the crib. I like to put her down for a nap when she's nearly out and again, zipping the flap would snap her awake. The distance of putting her down from the top of the crib felt like how it would if I were to put her down in her Jenny Lind crib, which is on its lowest level; however, I am also in my late twenties without any back problems so I could see how the side zipper might appeal to consumers that are perhaps older or do have back issues.<br /><br />Ultimately, I feel like you can't go wrong with either crib. They both have their pros and cons. If I could, I'd engineer a travel crib that had the sleek, luxe look of the BB crib with the side zipper, carrying case, and folded dimensions of the GF crib. In the long run, I decided to go for the BB crib because I felt like it suited my family's needs more. If you're really set on the GF crib, I'd suggest ordering directly from the company's website. It's currently on sale (06.20.14) with free shipping and free returns. Plus I believe there's a code for a free travel crib sheet floating around the interwebs if you order from them directly.<br /><br />Happy traveling!he crib felt like how it would if I were to put her down in her Jenny Lind crib, which is on its lowest level; however, I am also in my late twenties without any back problems so I could see how the side zipper might appeal to consumers that are perhaps older or do have back issues.<br /><br />Ultimately, I feel like you can't go wrong with either crib.

B00YVA2CA6|5|Yes,I received them.  They are wonderfully soft and I look forward to using them.
B004VRMOJ8|5|I got this bag for my husband for Father's Day since we will be having our first kid at the end of the year and he loved it! It shipped here quickly and is just as described would purchase from this seller again!
B0007KMUH4|5|I have had this stroller for a year and I love it.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so I need to avoid lifting heavy things.  At 15 pounds, this stroller is easy to lift in and out of my trunk.  It is really easy to maneuver through tiny aisles.  The wheels are smooth and turn with ease.  The basket holds a lot of stuff.  It will hold a large bag (or even two), but I recommend placing the bag into the basket prior to setting the car seat on to the stroller.  I leave the bag open so i can access whatever I need after the car seat is in place (or you could use smaller bags and still pull them out from the back).  Note: this stroller is so lightweight that if your (heavy) diaper bag is hanging on the handles, without the car seat in place or other weight in the basket, the stroller may tip over.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the release button (which unlocks the stroller from it's collapsed position) sometimes gets stuck and I struggle to open it.  Sometimes the release button does not catch and I prefer it that way.  I'd honestly rather break the button because I don't think it is necessary to lock it in this position since it lays flat in my car anyway.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind purchasing a new stroller when the baby is ready to ride without the car seat.  I still think it has been really worth it.  Now, since our family is growing, I am looking at the Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller.  It is only 21 lbs and it fits two children and has good reviews.
B00073HJG8|5|Great item reasonably priced. It holds many more stuffed animals than I expected. It's flexible and can be stretched to fit almost any corner.
B00KWAU9NQ|5|[[VIDEOID:7ff2911a855107b540d715febc3cf9c]] Here is a video review talking showing how to wear it & why I love it :  )
B003XMWF8M|5|I really like having this diaper bag dispenser. I was getting tired of not being able to find my plastic bags in my diaper bag. Oftentimes the bags would be balled up, and I would be so afraid they would have holes in them.  With this dispenser the plastic bags are well folded, easy to find, and the lavender scent on the bag lasts longer.  A great purchase!
B006ZVV0NO|2|Dissappointed in the product.  It does not cling to the window as it states.  I sewed it to suction cups so that it was usable.
B000K53UEI|5|Great! Still holding up after a year.
B006Z6E8AG|5|Perfect!
B0000645DP|1|My husband and I are soooo tried of this monitor!!! It's soo noisy all we hear are the neighbors on the phone or their babies.  Because that's all it picks up not your baby in the next room!!  Do not buy this unless you want to listen to your neighbors and not your children..  WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!
B000Q7G3VM|5|This book will contain laminated copies of photos from past and current generations.<br />There will be a supply of photos to interchange,ones that keep baby/toddler familiar with family members who are no longer living to living far away.<br />Can't wait to give this as a gift......
B00KEDXIQ6|1|This is the worst. Please do not buy this. It will be a waist of your money.
B0009RNXNA|5|This is a sturdy carseat bag.  It fits our Britax Roundabout 50 and the weight was balanced easily on shoulders.  I don't know how we would have managed flying without it!
B00119MR2S|5|I use these each time we are eating in a restaurant with our baby. They are great and makes it easier to clean up the mess. Also, our little boy likes to put his moth on the tables, so these toppers allow him to do that without me worrying about him getting sick or getting grossed out that he's licking the table.
B004V2I0FU|1|Never turned on. Was completely dead when I tried to use it for the first time.  Make sure to try it BEFORE you have a sick baby.  :(
B003OUWIJ4|5|I have purchased two of these car seats now for grandchildren.  I have strong confidence in their performance.  My two youngest live in a large metro area and spend many hours in their car seats.
B00KTTBZH4|5|Beautiful once up.  A little effort is required to install it and it's definitely a two person job but you won't be disappointed.
B0030UT1AW|1|It was broken when I got it in the mail, and dirty above the dial. I did not choose a used option!
B003KVWKZO|5|My son has always been pretty strong for a baby.  By the time he was 1 he was able to run on his own.  I knew he was stronger than the most other kids, but I didn't know how to help him take advantage of that.  While searching the internet I came across a video that helped me see his destiny, Midget Tossing Competitions!  I already threw him on the bed for his amusement, but this helmet allows me to put the mattress against the wall and throw him against it without harm.  I know he won't be able to do this forever (he's not a midget), but it is great having something that he can excel at at such a young age.  We haven't had a single incident since we bought it.
B0082I1IOO|5|These are so cute, they glow in the dark and work so well. Easy to clean and spot when you are desperate to find!
B005A3SY4G|5|i purchased this for my grandson and he is enjoying it every day I am very pleased with this purchase
B001C3KXPG|4|No complaints so far when using with my avent bottles. I have not tried using it with other bottle products to see whether it is compatible. Instructions on the product is lengthy and requires you to follow specific loading instructions.
B0007V644S|3|The bags do their purpose - they hold in smell. They're not so great for liquid; I would definitely recommend a separate wet bag to hold everything if you're using them to contain cloth diapers.
B001H1DOZO|1|I've had this mattress now over 5 months and my baby is 20 lbs. It's already starting to sag in the middle and there are permanent indentations where my babies body lies. Even though I've rotated the mattress every month it still have the impression of my babies body. I'm purchasing a firm Colgate Foam Mattress to replace this cheap mattress. It is not good for the development of your babies body as it sags horribly in the middle.
B008H57EWC|5|This was an absolutely adorable cloth ornament I purchased to save for my unborn baby's first Christmas - it's so cute and soft, and best of all, it won't break!
B0050MY90K|5|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, ACORDE CON LAS ESPECIFICACIONES DE LA PUBLICACIÓN, MUY BUENA CALIDAD, CUMPLIO CON LAS EXPECTATIVAS DE LO ESPERADO .
B004HFQOM2|5|Complete and great
B00N3P60FI|1|Terrible toy. doesn't display enough light, the globe falls apart, the plastic is cheap. this is a waste of money. I was not happy at all by what I received. It ended up in the trash bin.
B005KPXTT4|5|love these,  easy to clean, easy to adjust size. wonderful product
B003LDV2M8|5|this kit came with more than enough to capture this very special time in my life. Its very simple and the directions are easy to understand. i would recomend this product to every woman who is expecting.
B00AIVN87I|4|I got this pillow to help with my hip and back pain during pregnancy. I was a little disappointed in the lack of &#34;firmness&#34;. The pillow is pretty flimsy, but really still gets its job done. I do enjoy the shape of it. It is very nice having the support under my belly. I do wish it had a removable cover to wash, though.
B00006FXOZ|5|My husband and I purchased this table about 2 years ago for our oldest son. It held up pretty well considering we have a 4yr old and a 18 month old both are very active and it still looks as new as the day we purchased it. It's a great little table, it has great storage space for their books and movies very deep draws. Now we are using it as a entertainment table in their bedroom. We placed thier 20 inch tv and vtech vsmile game system all on top of the table. It really is a great starter table for the little ones.
B003ZUXBBC|5|helped to get off bottle
B00GL6CT7E|5|Very cute, and a good price.  I like the length of it, too.  Perfect for our little one!
B004UJPO6M|5|My daughter loves brushing her teeth. With this, she can brush her own teeth and because the handle is short and flexible, I don't have to worry about her accidentally poking herself. Other toothbrushes has long hard handles and you have to watch your child carefully when they brush their teeth with the hard handle.
B00CXVJ3KW|3|Nice, but a bit stiff
B003BNY9GY|5|We cannot get my two younger grand daughters to go anywhere without their security.  Much easier to travel with this small cloth than with a big blanket.
B00JYH2EHC|5|Love these
B005XRL3PG|5|My nephew loved it.  He is now going to throw out the box he used to keep his stuff in.
B008PD2106|1|The darn thing does not work!! I replaced the batteries and still Nothing. I think the crank is not good.
B00LK5J73U|5|This has been a perfect addition to our baby must haves. Makes going out with baby easier. As a new mom I worried about him being in the back alone and me not being able to check on him, but with his rear facing car seat. I love this mirror to keep an eye on him. He also loves it and has started making cute faces watching himself and his surroundings.<br />Was a bit hard to install (by myself) but once I got someone else to assist it made adjusting to the right angle easy.
B004GY8A58|5|Great pacifiers. It's really nice that it's one piece and easy to disinfect and keep clean.
B000LXQVA4|4|We bought this for our 5-month-old and she is still using it at a year. She really loves it and it was a great investment. My only dislike is that the springs hit hard when she jumps hard and it's noisy.
B00005B13F|4|Diaper Genie, by far, is the best diaper disposal unit I've seen.<BR>Some folks find it difficult to operate at first, but it isn't that difficult once you read the directions.  And soooo worth it!<BR>Diapers are sealed in each twist of the bag and when closed inside the unit, smelly diaper odor does not invade the room!  I had once thought the Diaper Champ was a slick unit but the diapers just collect in the unit with no liner or seal making emptying the unit almost unbearable for even the most brave nose.<BR>I am so glad I used the Diaper Genie, in fact, I'm getting another one for baby number 2 (I would have kept the other if I'd known we were going to have another baby!!)
B007BYN460|4|The shipping took for ever!!!!, from Hong Kong, not my first choice, but the unit is simply beautiful!, it puts my daughter at ease and it has been reliable Thanks!
B000WJLKQM|4|Always had one of these for my boys when they were little.  Bought this for a friends baby and he spends hours playing in it.
B001EU4ZF6|1|I returned this right when i got it. First off it sucks!!! It cuts out constently even when your in one spot or even same room. Its very bulky and to small of a screen. Never would recommand!!!
B000VZKGYY|5|Our daughter loves this.  We have had it for a while now and just replaced the batteries.  She uses it all the time and it continues to amaze her and work great. It has 3 colors to choose from and lights up her whole ceiling.  Great product and good price!
B005IOJG08|2|This does not fit our Ikea crib mattress. It is too tight and pulls up the edges. It also pills after you wash it.
B006ZISTS6|5|We purchased this play yard so we could have a place to put my nephew while we babysit him. He loves to stand in it and watch his favorite TV shows. Our only complaint is that it is a little difficult to fold up and put away but it is definitely worth the money.
B00MPXVYLO|1|DONT BUY IT.
B002UD65XQ|4|The top layer absorbs moisture and an inside layer keeps it from getting the mattress wet.  I bought two of these at the same time.  I was them on cold and normally let them air dry.  I think once, I forgot and put one of them through the dryer on high heat.  The top material shrunk.  The side material is stretchy enough that it still fits the mattress well enough (it is a little tight), so I still use it.  My other one is still fine.
B0052ORWS2|5|I got these for my son, he loves them!  They really do look like little spatulas, and they are easy for him to clean off with his gums.  They work much better than the usual spoons!
B000XT30G4|3|One of the better gates on the market.  I have tried the cheaper wood and plastic.  This looks nice and I think it has one of the better mounting systems.  I recommend making a template.  When you purchase the gate it will all make sense....<br /><br />How I made the template<br />Get a yardstick, take one of the gate extensions line up flush with one end of the yardstick.  Mark through the extension holes.  Drill the marked holes and use that to level and mark on the walls.  Making a template made installation much easier since the wall brackets have to line up perfectly on the wall.  It's easier then trying to use a metal extension.<br /><br />One downside is product companies should provide a template and at least one extra wall bracket, adhesive pad, screw and drywall anchor.  Just in case of a mess up.  one the adhesive is applied it's very tough to get off and renders it useless.  I also wish the door width was a little bit wider
B001FB567U|1|The camera broke the 1st week we used it.  The camera head lock was stripped so the camera would not hold in place.  Amazon was kind enough to return our money.  Going back to a Summer product.
B008B50YES|5|The pacifier set was purchased as a gift and the mom to be absolutely loved it.  Exactly as described and the words are very clear.
B0077M41Z4|3|These little brushes have their place in you drawer. They are just hard to find the right place to store, so they can be found to use when one wants to.  Probably it would be best to keep them in a little packet together.  I made the mistake of taking them out of package, now find them hard to store for using without losing them in the shuffle.
B0096E59G6|1|I purchased this item as a gift and was sad to see that it really isn't a whistle and that it was so poorly made that it didn't even light up! The &#34;whistle&#34; is a hole that you must blow hard through to emit a weak sound--just the forcing of air. I do not recommend this product.
B0084DS9EE|3|The monkey is very soft and cute, and a perfect size for little hands.  I was looking for a simple stuffed animal with no parts that might detach and become choking hazards. Unfortunately, the quality of the product leaves a lot to be desired.  I bought two, as gifts for new babies.  One of the two seemed fine, the other had open seams in three spots.  I ended up sewing the open areas myself by hand because it was cute and I didn't have time to return it (not to mention I thought there was a good chance I'd get another with the same issues based on other reviews).  It also seemed a little under-stuffed. I'm not sure how they've ultimately held up.  Hopefully they're still in one piece.
B0012KUDPE|5|The mat is great -- it's colorful, easy to install and clean. It might be a little too thin, as my baby still cries when she falls on it. I am sure it's better than falling on the floor, so I am not too concerned about that. What I am concerned about is that she's figured out at 8 months how to remove the borders and she uses them as teethers. She loves them. And my cat loves to sharpen her nails on the mat too.
B00LNS5UUI|5|My 20 month old son loves this.  Although we haven't used this as a walker, it still makes a good diaper and wipe(s) bag that the little one can carry.
B007IVJU32|5|This is awesome!!!! Fits great on my graco jogger. With this cold NYC weather, it offers great protection for my baby.
B001DLNAKM|5|The delivery was very speedy.  The crib is beautiful. Mom was delighted for the bar across the top back as a place to put blankets when not in use.  The color of the crib is rich and vibrant.  The design remind me a little of a sleigh bed.  The crib is well constructed, but it is much easier (recommended)with two persons to assemble it.
B0012LZD5I|5|good value for money.
B005491N08|3|Like the other reviewers mentioned, this guitar is pretty chintzy, and smaller than I expected. That being said, my four year old boy loves it. He had been begging for a red guitar, and didn't think he was quite ready for a real half-size guitar, so I went ahead and ordered it.  He has played with it pretty roughly and it's holding up. The strings could be better, but it plays okay. It's actually very cute. Looks red and white in the pic, but it's really more red and light pink.
B001CKBL5A|5|Scratch-resistant lenses, flexible earpieces, and resilient frames mean these sunglasses stood up to everyday wear and tear from my 2-year-old. I came back and bought a bunch more pairs for his cousins! The toddler size works well for our kids aged 15 months and up. They look a little big on the youngest ones, but still stay on their faces fine. They aren't too small for the 4-year-old. We love the blue, pink, and green, but the red was kind of washed out. Our son knows how cool he looks with these shades on and loves to strut his stuff!
B007PZO5EU|4|My almost  3 year old daughter loves this costume, she is a bigger 2 year Old and the 3t- 4t fits perfectly on her,  two complaints,  it doesn't feel like it will hold up over time, poorly put together. And why does it show furry boots and tights even though I can't purchase them?
B001OC5UNA|5|Bought one on Craig's list & loved it! So when I saw these on Amazon I bought 2 more! Shipped timely & easily assembled! Highly recommend!
B000IDSLOG|5|My 4-month old was smitten from the get-go.  I had procrastinated getting this toy b/c of the cost, but I was relieved that it became an instant favorite with my baby.  Easy to grasp, cute squeak, and drool-worthy.
B003HC8622|5|My son loved it he used it all the time inside and outside until he started walking on his own!!
B011H4ZSZY|5|Good product, good price and good shipping!
B002WB2GB6|5|Great stroller for the money. Helped my daughter and son in law on our latest trip to Seattle.  Made it easier to transport my Grandson to the gate.  The stroller has a 5 point harness for safety and it also has a lock , so when you fold it up and lock it, they can put it on the plane easily.<br /><br />Carolyn G.
B009HL5JSG|4|I ordered these bottles for my niece's baby so she could pre make the baby's bottles ahead of time
B00KDKKD1I|5|I ordered the pillow and pillowcase and am very happy with both! Great customer service and it is so cute to see my son sleeping with it. He loves it so much that he carries it around the house with him!!
B00834D5SO|5|Great seat.  Both of our boys ride in Britax and now we do foster care.  These are sturdy and easy to install and adjust seats.  The only issue is cleaning the seat if you do get a mess.
B00A0ZCSEG|5|This is pretty much the same as the Fisher Price wind up tv with adorable images and a lovely Lullaby for the baby. It winds up with on and off switch and than plays the GO TO SLEEP ...GO TO SLEEP.....Lullaby as the Zoo Animals in the train car move softly across the screen. A big hit for my young nephew .
B003E6OBMA|4|This sleep sack is great for keeping arms in, but loses its tightness after a couple of uses before you have to wash it again.  The fleece one stays tighter longer.
B000OT4UBW|5|We have so many stuffed animals that this is a nice way to get them off the floors and beds in the house
B009YDCH2S|5|Works great and perfect size for little ones.
B001O9F6M8|5|seems to have helped. I have used it in car seat, swing, boppy lounger and even when he sleeps and night. It seems to have stopped the head from getting worse.
B00GUN3Z1W|5|cheap and it is working out
B002QYW8LW|5|My almost 4 month old baby loves it. She didn't like other famous teething toys but she liked this one.  Easy to clean , easy for her to grab.
B0031M9EHE|5|very good item
B00F5S50UM|5|These are great to have in the car if you have grandchildren. Like to look at....their to little still to use but nice addition to the car!
B0000YVC5I|1|The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage.
B0060SYG6U|5|I used this as the table decor, I wanted to have few of the couple's photos and holding an ultrasound photo probably would've been nice but just didn't have the chance to do all that. I put up instructions for the game, and guestbook sign in place to ask the guests to write something... and at the end (although one of them broke...we had kids wildly running around and got a hold of the attractive cute animals...) I was able to give to the mom-to-be as a take home gift for decor for the nursery.
B00GZR7S7U|1|The Bath tile was very small and very cheap looking.
B000O7SR18|5|This sheet is so soft and comfy....I will be buying more. It came very fast and so glad I purchased this wonderful sheet for all our travels
B0035LLG2W|2|Nice for two months and then stopped working.  Have great cleaning,  started working again only to die again the next day.
B006SFUEF2|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT ..EXCELLENT VENDOR
B005ZNCOHY|4|Its good and cushion, but 4 stars because it dosent stick well with the tape given. It would need a glue for it to stop taking off.
B001QV8QDU|1|Does not suction properly to any surface so my daughter continually throws it on the ground which is what I was trying to avoid in buying a suctioned toy. Top heavy so hard to play with as a toy when it won't suction down.
B001C3I1AA|1|I didn't use this warmer frequently but it stopped working. Too bad I didn't buy it on amazon because of their amazing return policy cuz after a year and 2 months (in which I didn't use it often because I was breastfeeding most of the year) IT STOPPED WORKING. AND AVENT CUSTOMER SERVICE said they can't do anything or replace it in spite of the 2 year warranty it had because it was out of stock. Im not angry but i think it was unfair. Ive never dealt with customer care that couldnt acodommate a repair request. so weird. so strange. Anyways, Im NEVER buying THIS PRODUCT AGAIN BE WARNED because mothers use this product after the first year and on, and this didnt last for me. waste of money :(
B00003TL7P|4|Poop stinks.  This Champ has to be cleaned between bags, and there is some odor, once you get to those older-baby diapers.  But from experience with other diaper pails, it's just as good as the &quot;Genie&quot; and others.  The convinience of using regular bags is great, as well as the ease of flipping the handle to dispose of the diaper.  No twisting, etc.  The Genie requires you purchase ($) specific catridges of bags.<BR>The bags are easy to change.  I have been using it for almost a year now, and would use it for my next baby, too.
B004DC9TAS|5|My wife was adamant about getting this BOB and is very happy. Great product and will get lots of use!!! Thanks again for the fast shipping
B00H8MSFFK|3|Bulky but fulfills the need for a high chair with options to change the height and reclining position
B00HPQTJ18|2|This stroller probably will do the job for most people, but it did not work for us.  My daughter just kept sliding down in the seat and could not get comfortable.  It would have worked much better if the seat can be raised just a little more vertical which would prevent the sliding.
B0044R7HYC|3|Great improvement from our high chair. Our son is now three, and ready sit at the table fully. Additionally it looks great with our dining room set.
B00C3MLXBI|4|Its ok. It does pick up the babies heart Beat to listen to it,but the screen does not also show the Heart rate.
B004YZBIK8|5|Very easy to use! Very light weight!
B007HS6W6Y|2|I bought this mirror just for the light to be able to check my baby in the dark.<br />But the light is not bright enough and I can't see my baby's face at all!<br />I wish I could return it, but I had to use it to find out that it doesn't serve the purpose.<br />Very disappointing!!!
B008TA9X74|5|I have three kids and we must have gone through a dozen bottle warmers over the years. Most of them are junk. This one is easily the best of the bunch. It is very easy to understand and use and heats bottles up fairly quickly. One minor complaint: I wish it alerted you one some way--a bell or a beep--when the cycle was complete. Otherwise, a great product.
B005WG27LW|5|really love this clip.  I bought the black one a year or two ago?? and I am still using it.  I bought the blue one since it was cheaper than the black one at the time of purchase.  When I compared the blue stroller hook and my black one, the blue one feels more durable.  I guess PBnJ made improvements since I bought the black one????  I definitely feel a difference between the blue and black hooks.  In any case, I am happy with my purchase.  This clip helps a lot with the grocery bags and shopping bags.
B00LPZIFBU|5|They washed up well and still in tact.  My baby hasn't warn them yet but they are soft, stretchy, and just enough cushion for her lil knees.
B000071OVQ|5|We love this set.  We did not know what we were having.  We had a girl &amp; it is perfect for her.  It washed nicely, is of great quality and holds it's shape very well.  She loves to look at the animals on the bumper when laying in her crib.
B000K50780|5|These are great. They keep the wipes moist. My daughter hated cold wipes. She would cry, now she doesnt mind getting changed.
B00MRZIGVG|5|I have been searching forever to find a cup that is truly does not leak. This is it! I will never buy another cup.
B00FK5T54M|5|Exactly what I expected. Loved it. Perfect Thanksgiving nightlife. I would order again. I have order more of these night lights and loved every one.
B00JQSITMI|5|Good
B00MONDIJG|5|Great size and quality.
B007Q4EENM|2|I used Born Free bottles 4 years ago with my son and loved them!  When it came time to buy new bottles for my daughter, I knew I wanted Born Free again.  We've been using the new bottles for only 4 months and only 2 times a week while my daughter goes to daycare.  I hand wash them and do not put them in the microwave.<br />This morning, the ring part that holds the nipple in place separated from the part that screws onto the bottle… on 2 of my bottles!  I did not tighten them any tighter then I normally do and I never ran into this issue before.  They need to either reevaluate the quality of the plastic used or redesign the lid so that you cannot over tighten it so easily.<br />Also, the caps never stay on!<br />Very disappointment….
B000RFEBJY|5|This cover is awesome! It covers the whole seat area in the cart, so the baby doesn't touch any part of it.
B002VBXY4K|5|My grandson really enjoys this seat. My daughter can cook and clean and he is happy in his chair while she has to work. She just moves him from room the room. He laughs and kicks his little legs the whole time he is in his chair. I think big brother is jealous. Now he wants his own chair. LOL
B000Y2GY40|4|I like it  , it is very good cup , but if I can choose the color is better. I don't like purple but always send me this color~~~~~
B006ZISROC|4|This was a gift for my great neice her Mom loved it the color was what I expected would purchase again
B000089GEI|5|This is the first diaper bag I bought, I got the brown/skyblue, it looks chic and doesn't look like the traditional diaper bag. <br />It is so roomy that can fit everything. I couldn't have left home without it because I am the type that has to have every single thing with me even if my baby and I are only going to be out for 30 minutes.  <br />I've used it for 12 months now, occasionally clean the surface with wet cloth and it is still in great condition.  <br />I bought another diaper bag by NineWest just so I have a different kind but hated it, it looks just as big but no comparison to this  Little Company diaper bag. I couldn't get half as many of the stuff I needed into that bag as I could with this one. BUY IT!! It's the best diaper bag all around.  <br />
B000S9RF4M|4|This fun activity center can be attached to the swing, carseat, or whatever the baby sits in. We used to on the stroller also.  She is only 3 months old but likes to hit at it and watch it move. She really likes the texture of the butterfly.
B000058CC7|5|This is the best gate I have ever purchased! I got it to keep my dogs contained to one area when need be! They can see whats going on on the other side and the best part is it opens hands free! JUST STEP on pedal! Wish they made these when my kids were little!
B001L1UFL6|5|I gave this as a baby shower gift and was told this was the most used gift they received. The blanket is so soft and great for putting on the floor to lay your baby down on. It's also a really good deal for the quality of the blanket.
B00FA1XVZA|3|I ordered this towel hoping that it was extra large. Well, although it is 3 inches wider than most towels of this kind, it is 10 inches shorter. It is very difficult to wrap my child around not mentioning not be able to wipe him dry while he is still wrapped up.<br />It is cute and decent quality but if you truly want an oversized towel this is not it.
B00BPF7JWG|5|Shipped and received extremely fast! Its exactly what I expected and at a great combo price! Beats buying every thing seperately and it not matching.
B001FB567U|1|I returned this after one night of use.  The video screen will only go on when it detects some type of audio.  The factory settings for the type of audio it has to detect for it to turn on the video can not be adjusted.  It says its preset to pick up casual conversation but it wasnt sensitive enough to here our kid when he sat up and was talking... We tested it out ourselve and discovered it just wastn sensitive enough.  I called and there is no way to change the preset or to just have audio on all the time.  Returned it, trying the Summer Slim that looks like a cell phone, that one can have the audio on all the time if you would like.
B00KVJ8DHM|5|my grand daughter loved it for the nursery. very well made. great buy for the money
B00JWHAUDE|5|good as it is
B004A910UQ|5|I have had many strollers and this is by far the BEST!! I love it!! It is so versatile and compact. My daughter loves it and I can not wait for my son to get here so we can try it as a double!!
B004OR1DQK|5|My 6 month old son can use these which I find amazing.  He is able to grip them easily and hold on to them like any normal spoon or utensil.  They hold just enough food that he isn't stuffing himself too much which I like.  Plus, they are just really cool looking.
B000P635T2|5|Very fast shipping!  High quality product!
B001LENCUE|5|These bottles are great. Arrived promptly from the seller and were just as described. Prior to ordering these we were using the tommie tippie bottles and wanted to try a different brand that would still fit our labelled bottle bands (akin to the livestrong bracelet diameter and material) we use to keep the twin's bottles straight. We have noticed that the twins burp much less when using these. Also, it is much easier to eye-ball the milk level when holding the bottle by hand, which was impossible with the tommie tippie bottles forcing us to place it on a flat surface to check the milk level. The only thing I don't like about the bottles is that the level indicator tics are not colored but I'm sure that I'll get used to it with a few more days use.
B0011URFRE|5|We received the carseat about 1 1/2 weeks after ordering it and that's amazing considering that we live in Germany thanks to the Army.  With the free super saving shipping offered, not only was Amazon.com the cheapest but also got it here faster than any other company would have.  My daughter absolutely LOVES this carseat, and I love that I never have to buy her another carseat again!  Great product, not too heavy to transport through an airport, from car to car, etc.  I would definitely recommend that everyone get the Graco Nautilus carseat for their child(ren)!
B009R9KQEK|2|Edit: Finally took the tray fully apart o fix the problem of it not working, now it works great. Also we've found that the only way to really clean it well, is to take it out back and spray it with the hose on a nice day..<br /><br />We got this as a gift right before our son was born. When we initially set it up everything seemed to be working properly so we left it alone, until a few weeks ago. Our baby just turned 6 months old, and we finally tried putting him it to eat recently.<br />The problem? At first we couldn't get the tray to latch properly. No big deal since we just strapped him in. Now? We can't get the tray off! We've tried a few different times and even looking at it close up we can't figure it out.<br />Fortunately my sons small enough that we can just slip him in behind the tray, but I'm not sure what we're going to do when hes bigger.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that the color in the picture and the color I got are different, not a big deal. We got yellow instead of green.
B005DAF0T8|5|Nice!!! Lol
B00DJPKA76|5|Was exactly what My wife wanted
B000KGAHL6|1|This product is not worth your money- it is flimsey and doesn't stick properly. Even following all of the directions closely, this just fell apart.
B00CMOOC7O|5|Cute robe and slippers set. 0-12 months so you can get lots of use out of it.  Came quickly as described
B00DJPGL3S|5|I love this item and the price was even better.
B004HKK5TK|4|Great value for the price
B009HPGA5I|5|This is hands down the best stroller i've ever owned. We have 6 children and have owned many different strollers through the years. This stroller has served all my needs while traveling with 4 kids under four. It is so easy to go from one to two and even three. It handles so well and is a joy to push. It is that effortless transition that makes this stroller the only one I'd reccomend to parents of multiples and more than two children under 5. Add the well thought out parent tray,iPad holder, huge stroller storage compartment made of heavy duty material that is easy to access and wheels that glide on every surface and you have the perfect stroller frame.When you top off all of this with the 360* seats you can't go wrong. There is nothing better than moving along and being able to tur the seat to any direction. The solid frame seems to be very well made and sturdy and very easy to lift and fold. It is easy to stow in a variety of Vehicals as it is a system that can fold and pop apart easily. We have yet to even take a family walk with out at least one person asking us what it is and where it can be bought! Practical, well made, easy to use and beautiful.
B00LMTLSKE|4|Good quality, cute and comfortable, just smaller than I was expecting.  They fit the one year-old fine but I doubt they'll fit when he's two.  And he's an average size child.  Alva apparently makes a larger size diaper I didn't find out about until after I had bought these.  I just wish I had noticed that earlier; the &#34;One Size&#34; description threw me off.
B002SZT35S|5|Once we figured out how to attach the straps to the tv is was super simple. Although if are looking for heavy duty security (example. Climbing children) it be best to use a stud finder and attach it to the stud. But there is no children here, so we used dry wall screws with anchors and attached it where we needed.
B004DC9TAS|5|This was purchased for our daughter-in-law, and she and our new granddaughter are really enjoying it.  It provides a facilitates a good workout, but can be difficult to push uphill.
B002G1Y81I|5|This bib is so cute and will look cute this spring and summer with just a onsie.  Well made.  Highly recommend.
B004LYEOLW|5|I was very happy with my purchase of this stuffed Piglet. Piglet was bought at Easter time for my youngest son. He loves Piglet and enjoys playing with him. He has become a favorite and my son sleeps with him also.
B000ICZ9Y2|5|good
B005UV0USQ|5|I gave this to my sister in love and she love it.<br /><br />I will recommend it to other.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007K5LZ6Q|5|Love it. Got a pepperpot book for my first I love that the pages are similar but different at the same time.
B001CWVYMI|1|Disappointed. This did not fit my Safety First Air60.  I should have tested it before my flight out of town for Thanksgiving.  At curbside, I had to ditch this cover and the car seat I had planned to travel with and instead call my brother (who I was going to visit) and ask him to pick up a booster seat for me.  I'll be returning this.
B00KBGTRAC|2|Appears smaller than I expected from the website.
B000MFCHCM|2|We bought this for our three year old and newborn. When the baby is in his carseat, my daughter can't sit on the back seat, she can only stand. I tried pushing my daughter while seated in the front, without the baby in it and was unable to get it to go anywhere. My husband had trouble with it too. We ended up returning it. Maybe it might have worked once my son was able to sit up, but I didn't want to have to wait six months to use the stroller.
B0018EFGGU|5|I have purchased these spouts twice, they are the exact spout I need for my son's sippy cups. I only have 3 cups and used the first batch for 6 months before buying another batch. I bought extra this time so I won't wait so long next time.
B009NSICN2|5|great for a sleepover
B002C30S96|3|this is a very cute backpack. My kid love it, my mistake is that I never checked the reviews , WE saw it and felt in love with it. Now I have a problem with my son that goes to pre-k becouse he needs to carry a regular folder for notes and doesnt fit on it...Now i have to buy another big one but he wants the doggy hard time....ideal for toys, snacks.
070539462X|5|Very happy with my purchase. The book is simple and allows you to write exactly what you want about your baby, instead of the dreaded milestones book that doesn't allow your baby to progress naturally. Each month has the same headings that allow you to write how your baby is doing. Very pleased.
B004LE8ZLW|5|Happy with this item. Works great, looks great, and seems to be of good quality.
B00HQW9MCC|5|Easy to get my son in and out of. I love the placement of the cupholder in the middle.  Nice sized basket at the bottom and easy to open and close.
B00LL1XCVG|5|cute, rolls up well and my daughter loves it.  Washes just fine
B000I2Q0F4|5|Freddie the Firefly became my son's favorite toy, he is 11 months and he goes everywhere with it. It`s educative
B0030UUBMO|5|Yes it fits.
B000S9RF4M|5|great
B00E19T5P2|5|This cover fits my Diaper Genie Changing pad from Target perfectly. The color is perfect and looks just like the photo. The material is cozy and may be a little warm for a summer baby but it looks nice.
B004CS6O92|4|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 11 month old.  I think I may have waited a little too long to get this for him though...he probably would have found it more entertaining when he was a little younger.  But, it is a very well made rattle!  I love how clean and simple it is...it looks cool, it sounds nice, isn't annoying and cheap like so many rattles out there!  It's also nice and sturdy for teething too, and I love that it's eco friendly.  Fun little gift to give or get!
B000096QQ5|5|Must have for nursing moms.  So quick and easy to use.
B00HGA8W98|5|I am so obsessed with these. my daughter was a hotbox as a baby and these were the only blankets I could swaddle her in. now that she's older these are the only blankets I trust for her to have in her crib because they're so breathable.
B00B2AZJH6|5|I received my Spray Pal last week and I LOVE it!!! How did I go 18 months without this??? Well..a LOT of Clorox wipes...that's how. Yuck! This has seriously made a HUGE difference in how clean the diapers get and now my Husband doesn't cringe from having to rinse them! I love that I no longer have to do a full bathroom scrub down after spraying a diaper! What I love even more is being able to buy a product made in the USA and being able to show my support for a family as wonderful as the Spray Pal Family! Any cloth diapering family needs one of these!!!
B002VWZU7S|5|My daughter loves Captain Calamari.  His great smile sets him apart from the other expressionless Lamaze toys. Plus, he has all sorts of things dangling off his legs that she loves to grab and suck on!
B00PJRBUEY|5|Very happy with the toddler pillow. It's the perfect size and very soft !
B007SIZS36|4|I really liked these bottles for my newborn, the nipple was a good size for her little mouth.  The mixer worked well too.  The size of the bottle got bothersome which is why I give it a 4.  I got a free sample from my OB and the baby liked it so I bought more, then I realized how bulky they are.  We no longer use them, but some people may like the bulky feel.  Definitly try the single pack before you buy the multi pack.
B002T5Q01C|5|Excellent replacement for Charlie Banana diaper liners. Soft and big enough to cover the whole diaper. My only downside is there's a lot of packaging.
B00KX7Q4DW|5|Very satisfied! looks brty nice, works well, very sturdy, more so than expected. Great price. Would recommend and buy another anytime!
B00155WJMQ|4|Good product that does the job.  Can be a pain to take off sometimes, but I guess that is the point.  It also doesn't work very well with some of the knobs in our house, but works great on cabinets with closed handles.
B003E4E52S|5|it was delivered on time. it's a nice swing I just needed to get hooks for it it seems very big for a baby but at least I know we can have it for a long time.
B00XVR61DO|1|This is not made for a newborn, the hat actually fits my 3 1/2 year old. Don't waste your money,
B007R66AKO|5|My son wanted a hippo bookbag for his first year of preschool and this was it!! Love it and very well made!
B002J4U8M0|5|It is exactly what my daughter needed! Stands up easily on the ground for her tummy time. Seems well made. She loves it
B00456O466|5|Makes sterilizing easy for me!! Allows me to spend more time with baby then cleaning! They are easy To take to work so I can pump there too.
B000FFL58Q|4|My baby loves this play gym.  He has been using it since he was about 6 weeks.  I love all the different ways it can entertain him.  He has stayed busy with it for an hour at the age of 3 months.  The only downfall is that it does not fold down for easy storage.
B00CB9DKZU|5|This product works perfectly with my Contour Options LT double stroller, which is a good stroller overall but has wimpy shade covers that offer zero protection when seats are tilted back. The shade issue bothered me so much I was about to buy another stroller. This was certainly a more cost effective option, and I love that they offer different colors so I could match my stroller. A black sun shade seems like a terrible idea and this is the only brand I have seen that offers other colors.<br /><br />Snapping these shade extenders off and on is a breeze and they fold up easily into the bags that come with them. They also do not impact your ability to push the whole shade back if you don't need it, so you really don't have to unsnap them very often. You can adjust them easily while in use to add anywhere from a few inches to about 2 feet of extra coverage (they are very stretchy). They make it a little more difficult for my toddler to operate his own shade, but that is no big deal to me.<br /><br />As always with Amazon prime the product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B00BAAX39E|5|I cannot fault this toilet seat at all and am very happy with it.  It is very simple to fit for the first time and easy for my 2 year old to put on and off as needed.  My son was very happy to use this straight away.  It's a very secure fit with no wobbles or leaks.  It's also a nice design and has a good quality feel to it.  I highly recommend!
B00BPZ9SJ8|5|good
B0009A4FBQ|5|This pail lets you use normal trash bags and does a good job of eliminating smell.
B000I2WAY4|3|I recently bought this swing when our FP Aquarium swing finally died (it did survive 3 years and 3 babies). It looked somewhat comparable, and I loved the fact it plugs it - but I agree with the others that the motor is not reliable. However - that was also a big complaint when the Aquarium swing came out, and we were some of the lucky ones with that one. My 4 month old daycare child only weighs 13 lbs and it only swings half the time - and no it has nothing to do with an active or crying baby as someone else suggested - it's when he's just sitting quietly or when he's sleeping - it just stops. I'll be calling FP about it today. <br />
B00Q75D7VQ|5|These nursing pads hold their shape well, and they feel good on the skin. And when they need to be changed, they don't feel wet and disgusting on the skin. I'm a fan!
B00OJEQF0W|5|Robo spider was fine.no problems with it.
B0006H5WJ6|5|What you see is what you get. Nice quality
B00I90GR5U|1|It's been over a week since I ordered and the latest day it said it would be here was on her first birthday and her party is tomorrow and it's still NOT here! Not pleased at all!
B007QWOE70|5|works for me
B002QYW8LW|3|out of my expectation
B00JEV5UI8|1|Garbage. Go with something better the first time. I play music in the baby's room and it will go from being able to hear it to silence for 5 minutes. It makes me wonder if it would pick up the baby crying. Not to mention the sound isn't great and the buttons don't work well. Overall a waste of money considering I don't have the piece of mind hearing what's going on.
B002ITOC7S|5|My mom bought the Snuza for us for a shower present.  I had considered using some sort of monitoring system, but had decided not to (thinking I was just being an overly concerned mom-to-be - and NICU RN!).  We didn't use it for the first 3 months, but we've been using it since then and I think I'm sleeping a lot better!  Not really sure why we didn't use it before!  I have, and will continue, to recommend this product to my friends and other moms/moms-to-be.  It's easy to use, very portable, and works really well.  Definitely a wonderful product!!    Update 1/2015:  I now have a second baby and I am again using the Snuza!  I love it, my husband loves it and my baby doesn't mind it :)  I sleep so much better knowing that I will know the second something is wrong (if that were to ever happen).  There have been a few false alarms when the monitor comes a little loose, but I will take that any day over the alternative.
B003YL3EHI|4|This bath seat is great!  I am a mom of twins, and I purchased two, and I am very glad I did.  The babies love being in the tub together and I love the convenience of washing them together.<br /><br />Our tub does not have a smooth surface, so the suction cups on the bottom of the chair do not stick, but the weight of the babies in them keeps the seat level and secure (my kids are both around 19 lbs).  I would never leave my kids unattended in the bathtub, so I don't have any worries about the seats tipping.<br /><br />I would purchase these seats again.  They have helped make being a mom of twins a little easier.
B00ELXVM2C|5|Have put all the shades to good use over summer. Keeps the heat down a notch or two in the car making it bearable to come back to.
B009Z4VE7K|1|I was really excited when I first bought this and put it on but after three times using it now I have to recommend against it. The material stretches out and loosens as you wear it. I feel like I always need to keep an arm supporting the baby to keep her from flopping away from my body. Also rides up on my back so what looks like it could be a really supportive back panel doesn't help distribute the weight at all. My daughter is only 9lbs and carrying her in this hurts my back after 5 minutes. Seems like it would save time because you can just pull it over your head but it really isn't worth it.<br /><br />Also, a bunch of these reviews say the size runs small, I personally think it runs large. If you purchase be careful to keep the box so you can change sizes if necessary.
B0035ER8LC|5|Nice product and reasonably priced. We needed something less bulky and really easy to put up and take down and store. This crib fits the bill perfectly!
B00OTWUGOK|5|Love it- isn't too hot for my baby and was a great transition when we stopped swaddling her.
B003ZUXQXU|5|This thing is easy, soft and very convenient for taking your baby out in the cold weather.  We have an infant that was born in November so all of our check ups, two month appointments and trips to Friends houses to show her off all happened (and still are) in very cold temps.  This cover fits very snugly over the car seat and the flap is heavy enough that it stays still under normal windy conditions.  The &#34;lid&#34; of the cover is well above the baby's face (at least for an infant) so there is no worry about a cloth flap just lying on your baby's face when you are transporting her to and from the car.  It's like a perfect, little fuzzy tent for your new born.
B00L2FPBXS|5|They make me nervous because a necklace on a baby is weird and nerve wrecking but they actually work!! Controls the drooling
B000XT30G4|5|These work great and look great. I bought two of these to keep pets out of carpeted areas. They not only work well and are sturdy, but they look very nice. I'm so pleased.
B005WYJ6P4|3|The description states that it is made of birch, but does not tell you that the color/design is a laminate of some sort. I was thinking I was ordering a nice stained piece of wood that would be worth the price. It is thin and only one side has the color/design, the other is bare wood. It is a nice piece just not what i was expecting for the price.
B001IACJQ4|5|My son is 6'2\\", my daughter-in-law is 5 ft. and grandma is 5'9\\" and it's comfortable for all of us.  We looked at a lot of furniture and this type of nursery rocker is very affordable, easy to put together and comfortable.  The cushion needed a little extra padding as we spend a lot of time rocking and feeding my grandson in it but that is the only downfall and was an easy fix.
B004G8QSZI|3|Pros: 3 different uses. You can use most cart covers to also cover high chairs, but this one is unique in that you can put it in the floor as a mat. I like that option because my baby loves playing in the floor everywhere. The cover is cute too. It has three loops to put toys (you'll need three links)    Cons: It doesn't fit large carts (like Costco's). Also, although you can roll it up to carry it with you, the roll is long (at least for my medium-sized diaper bag).
B002ECE11Q|1|The description of this product would seem to imply that all three pieces are 100% organic cotton, while this is true for the blanket and sheet, only the fabric outer of the bumper is cotton, the filling is polyester.  Both the blanket and the sheet shrunk horribly after only one wash in cold water, tumble dry low (as the tag instructed).  The blanket is still somewhat usable, but the sheet shrunk so much that it won't even fit my mini cosleeper.  I'm very disappointed in this product.
B000NIDP6A|5|I absolutly loved these pillows! They are true to color and soft and bigger than I expected.  Loved them!
B00J69XK58|5|I LOVE the quicklatches. I can get this unhooked and moved in less than a minute! We are very happy with this seat!
B0031ARQLC|5|I built this by myself in about 20 minutes. Super easy. Either I am super talented or the instructions are well written. My 4 year old and 2 year old have laid on together and it held up fine.
B0045I6IAY|5|These are perfect..My son will only use these \\"Soothie\\" pacifiers. They work great.. and great for thinking caps (what we call them when he is being over stimulated yet still wants to be a part of the action. ;)..I like that they offer them in blue.. I have the green ones too.
B007WS421G|5|We have two children currently and one on the way.  I was determined to have a good umbrella stroller that would stand the test of time as well as remain comfortable for our kids.  Since our baby still hasn't arrived yet I broke this puppy out of the box and took it for a couple test spins with my four year-old.  First off, he thought the new stroller was his and loved it!  He's in the 100% for height and he still had plenty of head room/foot room.<br /><br />The seats adjustable back is super easy to adjust and the canopy is really nice since you get to choose from two options; one large and one smaller canopy.  My husband is a little taller than average and he loves that the handles on this stroller can adjust up.  I will tell you that they're already pretty high so, for the average height person no adjustment will be necessary.<br /><br />The last time I took this stroller out was to an outlet mall to shop for school clothes.  After placing 4 different bags filled with kids clothes on the back of this stroller, as well as my four year-old, I could still move this stroller with one hand!  I was amazed since you get little control of strollers once they become super heavy and you can almost never control one with just one hand.  As well as great control this stroller is super smooth.  I can't wait to use it with a baby.<br /><br />The only sorta down side to this stroller is folding it.  It took me a few times before I got the hang of it but once I did it wasn't any harder than any other stroller.  It does take me two hands to fold it but normally by the time you fold a stroller you've got your kiddos in the car.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product!  You might think that's it's a little expensive but I'm here to say it's worth every penny!  After my two kids and the countless cheap umbrella strollers I've been through I could've probably bought this one for my first and I'd still be using it to this day! Spend the money now and you won't have any regrets!
B008KW8IQS|4|Granddaughter loves the chair but it tips so easily that I have to make sure it is backed up against the couch or a wall.  I sprayed it with Scotchguard (Kids are messy) and I am waiting to see how long it lasts.  The jury is out right now on it.  If it doesn't hold up as well as I would like and with it tipping so easily I will probably replace it with something else.  If it holds up well, I would purchase again only because it looks cute.  Right now the looks and enjoyment of my granddaughter makes it great.  The only negative I found so far is the tipping tendency and while it can be managed, it is definitely a big negative.
B000056C86|5|My friend loves it.  It is strong, durable and looks good.  Her 9 month old finds the animals embedded in the play pen fascinating.
B007JLL7FK|5|Couldn't get through a pregnancy without this!
B00030088Q|4|I honestly don't know how people change their babies with the table facing sideways like almost all of the other tables on the market are arranged.  Once you try this setup, you'll immediately see that it is far and away the best way to approach diaper changes.  Yes, like the other reviewers, mine came with some broken parts, but the customer service was good and they sent out the replacements right away.  The person who said the table was wobbly obviously doesn't have it pushed into the corner as it is designed to be, because the walls make it almost impossible for it to wobble if it is put together correctly.  Either way, I'd suffer through a whole lot more than some broken parts and a little wobble in order to have the only table on the market that has the baby facing you this way--changing diapers with the baby facing any other way simply makes no sense once you've used this table.
B004DP8L1I|5|Great heavy duty towel.  Fun too.  Kids loved them.
B000GK5XY2|5|My daughter absolutely loves these for nibbling on fruits and veggies. She's still working on grabbing small pieces of food so some berries are easier for her to eat through the mesh. They are super easy to clean, dry and store so it's not like you have a lot of work to do outside of cleaning off baby.
B000GE1MEI|1|My 13-month-old son gave the top flap a hard pull and the whole thing snapped right off. I had to fish the broken piece out of the toilet bowl. Yuck.
B00EN0OM9I|3|hard to wash, don't buy if you don't like to do lego every time
B0007CS4EU|4|I like it, just wish the &#34;cube&#34; sizes were a tiny bit bigger. I feel like 1 is never enough and 2 can be a bit much
B00JJ6KRMM|5|it is good
B007QVYU34|4|This is a cute little suit for a little girl.  Order one size up for comfort.  The suit is a little fluffy when on so don't expect to put a swim suit on top.  I love the colors and the way it fits in the legs.
B001LNOZ9W|5|These are the best swaddlers - saved us a lot of time, especially at 3:00 am.  Baby loved having the snug fit and he couldn't kick or claw out of it.  I think he got a lot more sleep because of these.  Watch out if you are not in sub-zero temps, the mirco fleece ones are pretty thick and warm!  Buy the cotton and get more use out of them.
B00005V6C8|1|I found the diaper dekor to be easy to use but it did not contain odor the way it claims.  I had to remove the diapers every day and spray the entire thing with lysol just to decrease the odor.  The refills do last a long time but to keep the odor down you do have remove the diapers often.  I eventually threw it away and got a diaper champ which I love.
B002UXQRJS|1|Too bulky and hard to clip on
B005ASKQ42|5|I purchased this for a young lady of 37, who is expecting her first child in one month.  She called to tell me she had received it and is thrilled with it.  I wish I had something like this back in the day, oh well.  I think it's wonderful, especially for newborns to be with her mother AND father for the first few weeks until mother can bear to be away from baby.  The exhaustion experienced by all new parents can be helped with the simplest of things.  What a novel idea that it can also be used for portable travel and as a bassinet.
B001GSQDW4|1|I loved most things about this crib, actually.  It looks nice and it fits the space I need it to fit.  My twins sleep well in it.  The manual for this crib is very clear that you should ONLY use the mattress that comes with it, and no mattress that is over 2\\" thick for safety reasons, so I didn't.    My twins are now 11 months old, and they have learned that they can sit on the mattress, grab the edge, pull it back, and play with the springs underneath.  I don't see how this is remotely safe, although I can't find any other reports of other babies doing similar things.  Maybe my kids are weird, but one of the mattress seams has also come loose, which means the plastic cover could potentially be pulled off if my kids ever got the sheets off.    It wouldn't be that big of a deal except for the fact that there is NO 2\\" OR LESS THICK MATTRESS FOR SALE ANYWHERE.  They're all 3\\" plus.  So I can't fix this problem in a way that has been proven safe unless I buy two whole new cribs, which is completely unfair: a crib should last long enough for a single child to grow out of it, which mine haven't.    My advice is to buy some other mini-crib unless Delta addresses this problem.    UPDATE, 10/11/14:  At this point, I would give this crib zero stars if I could.  We have been using it as the twins' primary bed for a year now.  They are a year and a half old, and of average weight.  My son likes to jump in his crib - what toddler doesn't at some point?  Yesterday the wire frame that holds the mattress broke in two places from his jumping, tearing the cover of the plastic mattress open.  This crib is unsafe.  Do not buy it.
B0038JDVCE|5|Works as well or better than my other oxo bottle brush. comes with a stand so the water can drain from the brush and a small brush to clean the mouth piece. bright colors and cheaper to boot!
B00318CLNM|5|I'm Korean!<br />My baby love it!!<br />she drink water yet!<br />Good!!good good good good good good good good good good
B000BPNAKQ|4|I loved this pillow when I got it. It worked perfectly while I was in PT for a bad shoulder. However, it bunches and loses its fluffiness after a few weeks. Not sure I would want to regularly replace it at $100 a pop but it is great for supporting the lower back. (It is HUGE, though, so get ready to squeeze out your spouse in a queen bed.)
B000WOV7WO|3|We received this item as a gift and were very excited to use it for our young son. However, this item did not work well with our relatively-low carpet. We didn't put on the bumpers/breaks so that wasn't even the issue. Our son was learning to walk and his legs weren't strong enough to move this over any carpeted area. The only place it worked well was on the tile in our kitchen, but since that's such a small area we really didn't get much use of it.<br /><br />Once our son did learn to walk, however, he loved climbing all over this thing and playing with the attached toys. I think this is a great walker... IF you don't have carpet (or have a very very low carpet).
B003NSAY7U|5|Works well and gets the job done at a pretty fair price.  The cabinets or drawers may open partially but you have to be able to get your fingers inside to press them.  As far as the installation just center them up, mark, pre drill, then screw; it may take some time but remember you get what you pay for.  Can you make a better design for the money?  Didn't think so.......
B003XMWFAU|5|Works very well for us helps us make our umbrella strollers a double for our twins!
B00FL0ZXVK|2|Not great but cute for dressing up in public...
B004071ZOY|3|Cute, Not as good quality as I expected. This is more of a bath towel fabric than a soft robe fabric, which I wasn't aware of.
B002QYW8LW|5|&#34;Brush-a-Brush-a-Brush-a&#34; is what I tell our 1-yr old, and her hands are eager to grab onto this toothbrush and simulate the brushing motions.  It must feel good on her gums since she's teething, because she'll flip it from the brush side to the end to knaw on it.
B000056OUG|5|I bought this Sterilizer and I am so glad I did.  I was planning on breastfeeding but when that didn't work out, I found myself making formula everyday, sometimes twice a day. I can fit 6 Avent bottle set-ups in the sterilizer and it works great.  It is quick and easy to use, not to mention it looks great on my countertop.  It doesn't take up a lot of space and it looks nice.  Two thumbs up for this product!!
B004HKK5TA|5|The twins sleep great on them,  fast shipping, easy to clean, great price,  which is nice when you have to buy 2 of everything.
B00HZOD60A|5|This wall art makes your room pop, without doing permanent damage to the wall.  I have purchased several of these and we always get compliments from visitors.  Very easy to apply, especially if you purchase a small squeegee.  Easy to remove, but not really re-usable.
B001V7QM80|2|Great idea for a sleep sack, but mine lasted 4 weeks on my 8 month old before it had tears under one arm and on the back.  The fabric is just too soft to withstand your baby moving around much in their crib with it on.  What a shame, I loved the fabric.  I highly recommend their blankets but not the sleep sacks.  I am using Halo now which has turned out wonderful.
B007B5GSYO|5|So cute & soft - perfect child's toy!
B004184QB6|5|I could not be happier right now. I just unpacked the car seat that I ordered on Saturday the 19th and its ALREADY HERE on the 21st. The box is built just big enough of the car seat itself, no bulky packaging. The MAUI BLUE is an Amazing Color in Person, the pictures do NOT do it justice. I have already deceided that Britax will be our ONLY car Seat of Choice in this household! I am so pleased so far I can't wait to install it in the Truck :)
B002B55AC0|2|Doesn't hold well on our table. My 8 month old takes it off easily.
B00318CLVE|1|don't love it .too small
B008J3UD2U|5|I gave this to my daughter and she said it works well to protect her seat from whatever mess a 6 year old boy can make.
B005BGOWJ8|5|I bought these for my 2 year old daughter's bumble bee Halloween costume. They are perfect! They are stretchy so they will fit infants to older toddlers too I'm sure. Colors are vibrant and they are nice and soft. Shipping was really fast as well...could not be happier with my purchase!
B000P9TK0W|5|Simple and Easy to use and clean, very effective. Quiet and portable. Comes with two bottles. I'd be happy to use daily.
B00PJ8GN3G|5|I decided to try these after getting a coupon for them for Babies R Us. I was really happy that they were individually wrapped so it was easy to keep clean on the go until I was ready to use them. I think they are better quality than the other brands of disposables I have tried, covered well and stayed in place. I didn't have any problems with leaking, even overnight. I also liked that they were more ecofriendly than other brands which is something I am very conscious about. I would definitely recommend these and buy again.
B003NTVMX4|5|My wife babysat our neighbor's baby and they used these diapers. She loves them and i do as well, however we attempted to use these on our newborn. Due to the constant changing it got frustrating, having to wash an insert maybe 10 minutes after we just changed the diaper. We fully intend to use them when she gets a bit older. On the plus side they fit great, was very easy to put use, and even to change, though i wouldn't recommend for newborn use.
B000GKU7C0|5|great
B0038JDVCE|2|After a few bottle washing, the top portion of the brush started to shrink, thus cleaning the nook and cranies, specially the bottom of the bottles became a problem.  I was not comfortable using the removable part attached to the handle in cleaning nipples either, because it was more of a felt material rather than a brush.
B005IWM73S|3|This Rock n' Play is a cute solution to problems like acid reflux. I had hoped that our son would enjoy lounging around in this sleeper as he enjoys being slightly reclined (and suffers from acid reflux). Not the case! My son hated this thing from the minute we put him in it. That being said, I am not going to give this seat a horrible review simply because MY kid didn't like it.. yours might. I believe these reviews should be based on product quality, etc. in addition to a baby's reaction to it.<br /><br />The quality of this seat is pretty great. The padding is nice and cushioned, in addition to being soft. I would have to say that washing the padding for this chair would be a rather simple task (of course I cannot attest to this, but it seems easy enough). The incline of this chair would likely help a child that suffers from acid reflux, and would probably be enjoyable to a baby that likes to sit at a slight incline. The reason that I only gave this chair three stars is because the padding that our chair came with (not the white infant support you see in the picture, but the actual padding for the chair itself) did not come pre-cut for the safety harness straps to pull through. Of course we called Fisher-Price, and they were happy to send a replacement, but the sheer fact that something so important had been overlooked was disconcerting.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this chair to any parent whose child might enjoy sitting/rocking in this sleeper. Like I said, I cannot blame the chair for my child's finicky behavior.. After all, babies have their preferences, too!
B003AGC6LM|5|This bib is so cute!!! It is soft, well made cotton with a Velcro closure. Not too oversized  and perfect for my 6 month old girl. The message is also cute. I really like it.
B0000ALEVA|5|We use these for both Medela breast pump parts and Dr. Brown's bottle parts.  Works flawlessly in the top rack and fits a lot of pieces.
B000GK5XY2|5|My 8mo just loves this!
B00769SI5C|1|I bought these for the kids room, they are very cute but serve no other purpose then being cute. They do not offer any light protection at all! Plus you can see through them when the sun shines directly on them...definitely not worth $50!!!
B00OIHU2B8|1|it look real cheap and did not look like it was on the web.
B00DB5025E|4|A very good car seat, though it is a little complicated to install into the vehicle.
B003ANXD9Y|4|It never has closed quite right. Great color.
B00V852S4C|4|It worked great. The only reason I am taking off a star is that it did not hold any better than the SwaddleMe. Where it did outshine it's competition is the velcro. IT DOESN'T SNAG PEOPLE! That's huge for me. It worked great until my daughter got strong enough to escape.
B000GKWA66|5|Must have, I received this as a baby shower gift and it helps my baby sleep soundly. The company gives great customer service as well! I recommend the on the go sheep as well :)
B000HG7NVQ|4|I ordered this chair so my daughter would have something to use at her Grandmas that could be stored easily and saved for later visits.  It worked out pretty well.  The only problem we had was that the snap that holds the back of the chair in place would not stay snapped.  This caused it to just sort of lean against my daughter until we wedged a blanket between her and the very back of the chair.
B003LW7LF6|5|Natural solution
B007R66AS6|5|i love the product its perfect , new, original, big, pretty,  large, perfect, love it, and in perfect time ok
B00LV3WCEC|5|I purchased this for my grandson.  It was very comfortable and worked well.
B009L1VWCO|4|I just bought it for my 5 month old baby, I've used it only a few times but so far so good. I love the fact that I only have to use 1 appliance. Just 1 thing to wash! Super healthy made super easy!<br />After a few more uses, i noticed the bowl sort of MELTING. it still works fine, it just looks as if it were dirty.<br />Also, it does NOT fit dr brown´s 8onz bottles
B0013F7GKI|5|Dekor is a wonderful invention. No smell. Sturdy bags. So easy. No refills nearby, but online is easy
B003C0AHA8|5|Very cute
B002TUTQMM|5|I bought this for a visiting grandchild who is almost 3 years old.  She loved it for sitting at the table to do crafts, but preferred to use a dining chair without the booster when eating her meals.  It fastens quickly and easily and is very stable and portable.
B000A7V1EM|5|Love, love, love this hook chair.  My twins can sit at the table and eat with mommy and daddy.  They love it and I couldn't be happier.  Some points... The packaging can be confusing.  One part says it fits table with up to a 5 inch skirt and then another part says it fits tables up to 2 inches.  My table plus the skirt is about 5 and a half inches around the edge but the table alone is about an inch and a half.  That is the difference between the measurements.  This wasn't really clear and I almost didn't buy the chair for that reason.  Then someone told me that you couldn't remove the fabric and wash the chair.  That's not the case.  I take it off the frame every Friday after they eat dinner to wash it and it is completely dry by the next morning for breakfast.  Not sure what that says about my social life but oh well. Plus I got rid of two bulky high chairs.  It makes my dining room feel almost normal.  I couldn't be happier.
B00NVD1SQ8|4|Ok
B005LETP1A|5|This is the best teether...the easy to hold design and massaging bristles are brilliant! We have 3 of them and are in constant rotation...my daughter finds whatever comfort she can from chewing on these. 3 teeth and counting!
B00FXR5S20|4|At first this product did not work well for our daughter when I bought it at 8 months. I think her head was too small (although she has a larger than average head diameter according to the dr). But now that she is 12 months old it is a huge help during bath time. Keeps water and soap off her eyes and nose. Does take some practice for both the bather and the baby. My daughter knows to tilt her head back slightly when I pour water with this on her head now.<br />Doesn't keep water out of ears well however. But all in all, a great  fun and useful product for bath time. My daughter loves the ripples of water that flows out and has enjoyed bath time more since using this product.
B000G7WZFU|4|It was a baby shower gift. They loved ho warm and soft it feels and wanted to know where I purchased it so they could get more.
B00I2OKQ78|5|So nice. Love the soothing sounds and great lights it projects
B000IG4ITA|5|These sheets work really well on my 2 1/2 year old daughter's toddler bed.  They clearly aren't luxury sheets, but the seams are well stitched and they've held up to at least 8 washings.  So far they don't look any the worse for wear.<br /><br />The sheets helped my daughter to figure out which end of the bed is the head and how to sleep under the sheet.  The deep pocket prevents her from pulling it off during the night and keeps her blanket on her throughout the night.  The pocket also allows her to be able to make her own bed each day.  She does the sheet, and I do the blanket.<br /><br />It is quite wrinkly after washing, but my daughter doesn't mind it and it taught her a new vocabulary word.  If desired, it can be ironed flat.<br /><br />Overall, this one of the better purchases that I've made for my daughter's room.
B0002VAF3Y|5|Just installed this on a king size mattress set. It was not easy finding a bed rail that I thought was safe enough or easy enough to use for that size mattress. The way that this bed rail was designed, it is easy to install onto any size mattress.  My husband and I co sleep with our 3 month old and while my husband and I enjoy sleeping under the covers, my baby does not because he still has to be swaddled to sleep well at night. We got the bed rail so that he could sleep on the edge of the bed instead of the middle and not worry about him rolling off the bed (and he does roll, both ways, and can roll all the way over from back to tummy and onto his back again).  First of all, it was delivered very quickly. I have Amazon Mom and selected free 2 day shipping on this item. It was delivered the day after I placed the order!  The product itself was very simple to put together. I put it together myself without my husband within 5 minutes. My husband installed it onto our bed within 5 minutes as well.  This seems to be a very sturdy rail. I love the mesh, because I don't have to worry about him burying his face into it if he does roll over.  It's very tall as far as keeping a kid from rolling off of the mattress, I imagine I will have lots of trouble with this when my son learns to stand, but then again if he is in a twin or full size bed the mattress may be thin enough to make the rail height more significant. It is very long rail, and works great on our king size mattress, so I know as far as length goes it will work fine with whatever bed we transition the little one to.  The only downside to this is the length of the rail (and my arm span) makes it difficult to unlock and fold down. My arm span is just long enough to reach both locking mechanisms, so my hand dexterity is compromised when I attempt to do anything at that range. The length is not a problem for my husband by himself, but I most certain will require assistance if I ever needed to put the rail down.  I highly recommend this rail, just for the ease of assembly, installation, and of course the shipping speed was excellent.  Update: About a week after I wrote this review my son started fussing while swaddled at night, so he started sleeping free and loose. As a result, he can now roll around in bed and has rolled right into the bed rail. I have had to move him away from the bed rail, and have found him in a variety of positions. He has had his face pressed against it, he has been on his back and right against it, he has been on his stomach and right against it, and he has been on his side with his back to the mesh. I'm pleased that the bed rail has not budged at all. My son easily weighs around 16 lbs at this point, and I have no concerns about whether or not the bed rail will hold his weight and keep him from falling. I'm extremely pleased with this product.
B00BUC705A|2|These were too snug but the rise was the correct height. The next size up fits the legs, etc, but pulls up to my toddlers chest. I cannot imagine these training pants fitting properly on any child. They are also plasticy and loud. They look like they would contain an accident although my child hasn't had one. I won't buy any more of these.
B00AB3LR8U|4|Enough room for items needed for day to day use. Very nice to look at overall a great and efficient but
B001CZAS9U|4|I love the large bank, this is it second. Bought one for both my granddaughters.  Only wish is that they could have been more careful when applying the tutu,  on this one it's crooked.
B002YQQQJW|4|These do exactly what I wanted them to do. They stacked nicely and are easy to open and close. I just wish there was a fill line as I occasionally overfill them and then they open in the freezer from the puree expanding when frozen.
B00G3XREOS|5|This has been a life saver for my wife with our two children. The snap in place is so easy. One of the better Stroller additions
B00A6GIFKA|5|Perfect for on the go.  Contains the stink from poo diapers.  Love the pattern.  Couldn't be happier with it. Loveit
B00B7M7CMO|4|The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven't actually used it yet. I think if it is anything like the crib soother and projector it will be great as well.
B007UYBOKY|5|love it and my niece love it as well.
B00BKCYJFY|5|We got this for my son for Saint Patrick’s day.  The bow tie is sewn on and pops out which adds to the tux look.  We got some cute pictures with him in it.  It probably would not survive use day after day, but for one day a year it should last through multiple children.
B0045VA3SO|3|Too chunky.  Baby is stuffed with too much fluff.  Good for other things like padding at the hospital etc.
B00EYJG2CI|5|Fits great on my Medela pump without any trouble. I'm able to use the Honeysuckle milk storage bags and save the environment as well as my wallet.
B0055LV3XW|5|So impressed when I got this! It's tall and sturdy enough to keep my toddler out of places she doesn't belong and long enough that I can place it across any doorway in my home. So pleased with this.
B003WKZ4Y2|5|This is our second. The first was bought two years ago and still works great for my two year old boy.  Just got a new one for our five month old. Wish I'd got it sooner instead of using stupid tablet apps.  This thing works great.
B005UV0UEA|5|This is easy to set up/take down. Gorgeous colors and very sturdy. Couldn't be more happy with the product and super fast delivery.
B00G4D9RLU|5|I love this Cozy Infant deluxe baby monitor set! We have a newborn son and we were not happy with the features and prices of monitors in the stores, so when we can and searched on Amazon this appeared to be one of the best values. It set up instantly...I placed the camera near our son's crib in his room upstairs and went downstairs with the monitor and the picture on the large screen was clear and the two way audio and pan/tilt feature worked great. Even the LED lights that came on when viewing at night did not wake or disturb our baby. What impressed me the most was their thoughtfulness to make the camera also cordless and battery operated for safety and peace of mind. We will surely recommend this camera/ monitor to our friends with infants or who are expectining!
B000056HK2|5|We bought a dresser at IKEA and attached this changing pad to the top of it.  It has worked out great for a changing station.
B0007Y3NGC|3|I bought this stroller in red after doing a ton of research.  After owning it for almost a year, I am not very happy with it.  My 3 year old is too tall for the backrest and this piece of fabric cuts into his neck making it very uncomfortable.  My 10 month old baby is also uncomfortable in it.  He can't sit up enough in it (poor support).  The drawstring is not easy to use with a child in the stroller.  It is also very hard to close.  It takes two hands and then some.  It turns great and the fabric is heavy.  Also it stays upright even with multiple bags hanging on the handles.  The storage is sufficient and I like the bottle pocket.  I haven't had anything break on it. Major drawback is how uncomfortable my children are in it.
B00CBDX4ZW|4|Soft, munchable, and -washable!. The small huggable size lets our little one drag it by one braid. No concern about sewn on objects!<br />Everything I was looking or in our little girl's first dolly!
B003ULPN94|4|Actually, you don't need to buy the net because the Stokke includes one in the bag, and the raincoat for Stokke.
B004B9HDU6|5|I bought these rubber duckies along with the stovepipe hat ones.  Great for kids and adult book lovers.<br />I will use them as party favors for a librarian's retirement party.  Also a great idea for Moms and teachers who would like to treat their students with something on March 2, Read Across America Day!
B000GB0NZK|5|I really like these snack catchers!  A friend of mine had them and suggested that I get them.  I was tentative because I wasn't sure whether I really needed another toddler thing and we had been using normal containers and just having our son come to us when he wanted a few cheerios.  Well, I decided that I would give them a shot and I'm so glad I did!  It took a little while for my son to figure it out but once he did, he loved it and it has made the whole snack thing SO much easier.  I can limit how much I put in there and he knows that he only gets whatever is in the catcher.  No more finding cheerios all over the house because they don't fall out.  I have heard of kids figuring out how to get the cheerios to dump out but I guess my kid cares more about eating them than playing with the container because we haven't had any issues.  I think it would be neat if there was a lid you could put over top of the whole thing so that the snack doesn't go stale but thats just a thought.  Really, these things are perfect for helping your child be independent and limited at the same time =)
B005IWM73S|5|This was purchased for my daughter who was ten weeks early and only 4 lbs.  This is great because of the incline.  I don't have to use anything to keep her upright to help reduce her reflux.
B004S6W2GC|5|This is such a clever idea - and like all mom-invented products, it's one where it's the simplicity that makes it so smart.<br /><br />We've used these for a few months now. They really do work amazingly well at keeping the bigger boys {5 and 8} in a safe spot next to the car, while I unbuckle the baby and get her out of the car. It gives me a lot more piece of mind, knowing that they are close by.<br /><br />Parking lot deaths and injuries are just far too frequent - and so avoidable. It only takes a second for tragedy to strike - but it only takes a few bucks to purchase a Parking Pal magnet to keep your kids safe, secure, and nearby!
B00IRHALNY|4|Very pretty and arrived well packaged.
B000RLD6F8|5|I love any baby decor with birdies, owls, and trees, but it's become a trend. Now it's difficult to find inexpensive items in this \\"forresty\\" motif. The price of this was so cheap I had to snatch it up! It looks adorable.
B0076YVV3S|5|I really like this diaper bag!! It matches our nursery perfectly.  I just wish it had ties on it rather than a hanger.  I just added a 3M clip to our changing table and attached the hanger hook to the 3M hook.  It is very pretty!
B008465QA6|5|This product is so great! I love that my wipes and diapers are in one cute little clutch so I can just grab it and go to change my baby rather than look for wipes and look for diapers. Such a time saver!
B006PJC4G8|5|These things are great for your development pics for all to see!  Takes the guesswork out of future reference.
B008KW8IWC|5|My daughter loves this chair. It's safe and sturdy. Wish it were easier to clean up but great otherwise! Recommended.<br /><br />Update 7/28/14:<br />We just cleaned it for the first time since it was purchased.  Some reviewers noted it was hard to clean, we spot cleaned it with Oxy-Clean and then washed it with our garden hose. We let it dry out in the sun and it looks line new.  Still in great shape. Highly recommend.
B0034XRE90|4|This was a great way to put our child to sleep as long as she fit in it. Well made, no problems ever, and a great look. I recommend it for any new parents or parents to be.
B008LQD1EW|1|These nipples are crap, constantly getting milk on myself....
B0038JE63W|5|Just what I wanted and couldn't find in any stores.  Had lost my other one.  Wish I'd ordered more!!!
B00881EE8C|1|I never received this package. I have messaged Amazon daily for over a week about it and I have not heard anything back. I have now called UPS and they told me they never got it. So Amazon needs to resend this and make sure it is an over night delivery and if I do not hear back from you all in a email by tonight after I have emailed many times about it I will contact my bank and file a claim over it and there needs to be a tracer as well put on it when you resend it as well. If this is not cleared up by late today I will call my bank and others to let them know how Amazon is not responding to my emails about this package as well as I will no longer order from Amazon!!!!!!! GET MY PACKAGE RESENT AND EMAIL YOUR CUSTOMERS BACK! THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ON AN ITEM OR COMPANY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN MY MONEY AND DOES NOT CARE TO RESPOND OR RESEND THIS ITEM!
B007NG5UF4|4|Works well. 4 stars for only one reason. When the power goes and comes back the unit even if it was off before turns on automatically.
B0000E262S|5|We purchased this to also use as a simple baby moniter. I know once my 3 month old moves out of the co-sleeper and into her own (in a few months) this will be my sanity. For now we use it with our \\"safe and secure co-sleeper\\" and LOVE it. I have always let my baby sleep on her belly, simply a choice my husband and I made together when we first had her, babies have been sleeping on their tummies for centuries and in my opinion sleep position does not cause death. However whether she was on her back or tummy my sleep was never settled not knowing if something was going to happen. This has eased my mind and let my little one sleep consistantly 9 hours a night. I have had it for about a month now and have never had a false alarm, though I have taken her out and had it go off with a simple switch of a button it's off. I would HIGHLY recommend this for any parent who's mid can't seem to leave the \\"what if\\" alone. For under 100 bucks this is a MUST. SOOOO worth it. And it's great to know I'll be able to use it for years to come (with subsuquent children as well)!! Go get yourself one!!
B002O0A6YO|5|This is the softer sheet I have ever bought for a baby crib. I absolutely love it, and every time my daughter lays down on it, she rubs her cheeks on them, it's so darn cute. This one is a winner, folks!
B00HRKNFTY|5|The product did the job it promised to do....
B006JCV86I|5|First of all, this sleep sack is adorable!  I appreciate the fun pattern.  This sleep sack fits my son well.  Be aware that the Summer brand sleep sacks run a bit smaller than the Halo sleep sacks, but I did not find this to be an issue at all.  It was true to the size on the packaging.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.
B00CM8OZ6I|5|Works like a charm. No complain. I don't see a reason why not get it. Much cheaper and it's just like the original.
B007KFEJNW|4|For my newborn it's just too big, and my baby is 8 pounds 14 ounces and about three weeks old...and I have to put it to its smallest setting and still it's hanging off of him in some areas, I wish I had chose something else even though it would have been a little more expensive, it would just be nice to have something that didn't make my baby look like he has some type of a saggy behind lol but it is good quality, I mean like these are the only diaper covers I've ever used but I haven't had one time where the pee messes up his clothes, and my baby is breastfed, he can really let go of a lot of pee if you know what I mean lol
B00D4XZO2E|3|economic and lightweight. you get what you see.
B001BWT5IE|3|This diaper pail has both good and bad points and I'm really on the fence with how I feel about it.  First the good points - I saw some other reviewers complain about the smell.  Actually, the LACK of smell with this pail is its best feature.  I have NEVER smelled this diaper pail even when it's been full to the brim and I can't say that for any other pail I've tried.  The pail holds a lot and it can take a regular trash bag - no more buying those expensive liners.  For those reasons I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase.      There are a couple of annoying aspects to the pail that make this a less than perfect product.  For one thing - it's loud.  When you turn the handle to allow the diaper to fall into the pail, the whole thing makes a loud clunk.  For this reason we avoid turning the handle when the baby is sleeping.  Then in the morning there's a pile of diapers needing to be put into the pail and of course they won't all fit at once - you have to take them out, open the pail, and toss them in.  Not the worst thing ever but annoying in the middle of the night when you're not thinking.      The other problem?  Individual wipes can't just be tossed in.  They get caught in the mechanism.  And my husband can't seem to remember this so I often find myself wiping some unpleasant substances that the wipe streaks onto the pail.  It's ok to just lift it open and throw the wipe in but still a little annoying to have to do that.  Oh and the last annoying feature is that when the bag is full it's really hard to pull out without tearing it.  You have to remember to change the bag before it gets too crammed.  That can be a hard thing to remember since this thing lets out no odor - so on that note, I guess we're back to full circle.  No odor really is a plus in my book.
B0092YYF6A|5|I got a big Thank You from the recipient of this Infant to Toddler Rocker.  It is a great gift.
B001D475FU|5|This works great!
B00E4OCCEK|5|Great
B00THSMGSK|5|My baby is in the age of teething now and he has lots of saliva, which gives him drool rashes. I have to apply Aquaphor to his face every day for many times. It does help a lot but 2 big tins of Aquaphor were used in a shot time.  I was recommended by a friend to use this All Purpose Balm.  Amazingly, I only used this balm once a day at night after he felt into sleep for 3 days, all the rashes were gone!  And after the rashes were gone, I don't have to apply that any more unless there are new rashes coming out. It saved me lots of time and plus, this balm is 100% natural and I don't have to worry about the hash chemicals in most of the cream in the market.  I love it very much and would recommend to you.
B0032IC7TO|4|I bought this item to secure the blind cords in my children's room. What I like about it is the simple and functional design and the fact that I don't have to drill holes on the walls to secure the cords. What I didn't like about it is that it doesn't hold a lot of cord. My cords are standard length about 4 ft and I kept having about a foot of cord left by the time I rotated as much as I could fit into this device. The way I solved for this problem was by cutting about 2 feet of the cord and shortening the cord first before securing it in this device. Once I did that, I was able to secure all of the cord all the way to the top of the window.<br />A few reviews said that in order to open the blinds, they have to undo this device first. That wasn't my experience. I am able to open the blinds without undoing the process of rotating and securing the cord inside this device.<br />As a side note; I first looked for this type of product in a few stores, and through that process, I learned that new shades/blinds come without cords and operate on touch basis for obvious safety reasons. My children are very young and this device works for now, but once they're older, I will consider changing the shades to the new technology. Just an FYI for the readers should they not be aware of such option, as it was news to me.
B005BZKH6Q|1|Amazon sells this almost 3 times more expensively than at BRU.  However, that doesn't matter. This cup was a waste of money if you're needing something spill or leak proof.  My 10 month old daughter actually was having water come out with a small but steady stream on these.  The very supple sippy part is nice and maybe because of that she got the idea that end goes in the mouth, and the handled are great, but the whole point of it is missed.  There are plenty of negative reviews on BRU about this, but I chose to belive the good ones.  So much for that.  I reccomend the Playtex Sipster [[ASIN:B0009EXN10 Playtex 2 Pack The First Sipster Spill-Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors Vary]] for a truly spill and leak proof one for for those first sippy cup learners.
B0000A1O7P|1|I really like the idea of this chair and really wished it worked. Our dinning room table is odd, the extensions pull out from underneath, so i wasn't too surprised it didn't work on that table. I was surprised that it didn't fit on our kitchen table, which is just your standard small kitchen table. I also tried to on our computer desk just to see and it didn't work there either.
B00PTK9FDE|2|Used in hatchback. Shade was wide enough but too tall for my read window. Likely owing to this factor, the suction cups did not function properly. Returning.
B0038JE3PI|2|This product looks nothing like the picture at all.  It has no shape to it and is really just a flattish piece of waterproof fabric.  Every time my son goes to sit down I have to readjust it.  If you don't, the whole device is pointless.
B00BH0RKSC|5|My daughter wouldn't have any pacifier and would only suck her bottle tit , that made her eat more then she needed afterwards she would spit it all out  but cry as she wanted to suck . I found this pacifier on internet and i, m so happy , she took it from the first moment and loves it . Easy to wash , doesn't hurt even if it falls under their had or body , only thing i would have liked if it had cover
B004WN7AH2|5|Great idea and great product! Super turn around time!
B004G8QT5C|5|We just received this car seat today and I am very impressed. I spent a lot of time researching convertible car seats for my one year old daughter who outgrew her infant car seat.  I was worried because they are so much bigger than the infant car seats and was concerned her new car seat would not fit in our 1997 Hyundai Accent which is a very small car.  My husband had no trouble installing it (it only took him about 20 minutes) and it fit comfortably behind the driver's seat.  We didn't even need to slide the driver's seat too far forward for it to fit rear facing.  The seat has plenty of cushioning and my daughter seems very comfortable.  The harness is way easier to adjust than that of her infant car seat.  I definitely recommend this car seat for anyone who has a small vehicle and who does not want to spend $200 for a car seat.
B001P4IBTM|5|Just what we were looking for.  Good quality,  colors vibrant. Adorable for my new grandson. Loved it. Thanks so much!!
B0096IC08M|5|Very nice
B008J3UD2U|5|I loved the material in this product and I think well at all to protect the car seat and additionally to have pockets to carry baby things
B0083973FK|5|I cannot say enough good things about these diaper pads!!! Wow, wow, wow! I wish I had known about these months ago! My almost 2 year old had been consistently soaking through his diapers at night for close to 8 months. We tried all sorts of diaper brands, even the super duper thick absorbent overnight huggies, we upped the diaper size at nighttime, tried not letting him have much to drink after dinner, etc -- everything we could think of! The only chance of keeping him dry was to go in at midnight and put a new dry diaper on while he was sleeping (and hope he didn't wake up in the process -- not a happy boy if he did). Even still, probably half the mornings I was still having to give him a full bath and completely change his sheets because somehow the diaper had leaked anyways. It was like he saved up all his pee plus some for nighttime. I was to the point of just resigning myself to the fact that this was going to be our morning routine for a good long time until he was old enough to go diaperless at night. Sighhhhhhh.... Then in conversation several weeks ago I happened to mention my dilemma to a friend and she recommended trying these and that she had very good success with them for her kids. I ordered them right away, and started using them the day they arrived! And wow, I have never been so amazed at a product before and have never been so happy and so relieved to find a solution to a problem. And I have NEVER seen such incredibly enormous diapers in the morning!!!!!!! ;-) I've been using them inside the overnight size 6 huggies for a full month now, and they have worked every night minus two and that was because the strip of fuzzy fabric stuff across the front top of the diaper that holds the little tabs in place actually came off the diaper itself because it was so full. It looked like he was wearing a little belt with a diaper only attached in the back. Apparently when the diaper gets too heavy, that fabric piece can pull loose and separate from the diaper.So in my opinion, a problem with the diapers, and not with these pads. But other than those two nights, I have had 100% success with these diaper pads. I am a very happy satisfied mommy and along with continuing to buy them myself, I will be sure to recommend these to anyone who has similar problems with their kiddies, and I only wish I had complained out loud to my friend sooner! :-)
B00BEVF2NY|5|This car seat is amazing. You can tell right away by the way it looks and feels that it is a high quality car seat. The most impressive thing though is the easy install. It took me less than 2 minutes to install and it is in so tight.  My child loves it. Says it is very comfortable.
B00MEVAAW6|5|I love kawaii baby diapers! my husband likes the easy Velcro.
B002WB2G9I|4|For travel and quick trips around town this stroller is perfect for our needs at this time.  We bought it specifically to take on vacation to FL and were not disappointed.  Quick and simple folding, small area for parent belongings at the handles, and easy to maneuver. One drawback, however, is that on this model there are crossbars on the back that don't allow for easy access for the underneath storage. We hung the diaper bag off the handles and it was fine, but would've been happier if we could have thrown it under the seat. Overall, its perfect for our basic needs. Would definitely recommend.
B00282ZR9M|2|Neither of my children have liked it, the crinkle material bunched into one corner, and one side sheds long strings that my one year old keeps putting into her mouth. I can't let her play with it anymore without watching carefully. (i.e. I can't leave it in her crib.)
B002AQIA6S|3|A customer representative from P'Kolino very promptly responded to my complaint (see my original review below) with the following explanation:  \\"The Little Sofa/Sleeper is most definitely not loaded with chemicals. It would not pass the US, EU, and Canadian safety standards like it has if that were so. The smell you were smelling was the stain retardant that is put on all of our Sofa/Sleepers and Little Reader Chairs (our best selling item). The smell you are experiencing is not a common thing, however it has happened before. The reason being...during the production process, after the stain retardant was put on, the item must not have had enough time to dry before it was packaged. Then it sits in a box for 2-3 weeks while being shipped to the states, and then a few more weeks at the Amazon warehouse (or any warehouse, depends where you purchase it from). So basically the smell is trapped and once the customer receives the item and opens the box the smell is very strong. It does air out - we have had customers leave it outside for a day or two - but we have also sent replacements to customers who simply just want an exchange. We understand that it could cause concern, but there is no reason to react more strongly than necessary.\\"  That's a perfectly acceptable explanation and I've adjusted my review from 1-star to 3-star based on it. That said, based on other reviews, the odor from the stain retardant is obviously an issue and I question some of the quality control the manufacturer has in place.  Original Review:  \\"I was stunned by the chemical odor emanating from the P'Kolino Little Sofa-Sleeper upon it's arrival. It smelled so disgusting that I never even took the thing out of the box. I wanted to call the EPA because I thought my house might be declared a Superfund site. I get that my kid is going to be exposed to loads of chemicals, it's just a fact of life, but I don't see any reason why I should stick this chemical time bomb in his room. I wouldn't let my worstenemy near this thing, much less my child. I'm emailing this review to the manufacturer to see if they'll respond and explain.\\"
B008QMIRXG|5|I am very glad to have found this indispensable product. Genius. Holds crackers, blueberries, cereal snacks, pieces of cheese - all the things that would otherwise end up on the floor.
B0006M1B0K|1|This purchase was a gift for my niece's new baby boy.  I ordered the blue bear.  It turns out the color is enhanced in the picture presented.  If you are looking for the blue bear, don't bother, buy the cream-colored bear.  The bear was such a light blue it looked gray, same with the blanket.  The fabric used for the binding and  back of the blanket is a beautiful blue but the top of the blanket is the same gray color as the bear.  I was very disappointed.  I cannot comment on how/if the bear's sound works.
B004L2JJ6O|3|much smaller than expected, fit is small on chair but it still functions. safety belt is good, like that it is portable.
B00CRXKQAM|5|as an expected. light umbrella stroller, perfect for bus ride, not for long ride
B008KW8J80|1|this chair sucked not a good price . so small my 2 year old hated it..recliner from big lots was way better and it was 60.00 bucks but baby and i love the chair from big lots..JUNK THIS ROCKER IS...
B002R2BFVM|3|The gate is expensive and despite installing it  according to instructions, still has a gap at the bottom that I am concerned my determined 1 year old daughter will likely wriggle under.<br />I bought it for the bottom of my steps but have a baseboard, and without adapting (with pieces of additional wood) or purchasing the spacers for an additional expense (and having to wait more for them to be delivered) from Dreambaby, I couldn't install it where I originally intended. Therefore, I installed it at the top of my stairs instead, and the gate still doesn't seem to be tight enough, despite following the installation instructions.<br /><br />Still in trial phase.
B00494DNZC|5|Excellent product, in perfect condition, what they show is what they sell, I am totally satisfied with the purchase, I highly recommend it.
B0001IU5HY|5|I am a mother to a 12 week old he loves this swing and loves the mobel on top. When we first brought him home he was a preemie and I was worried that it would be too big for him but it wasn't it snuggled him just right. All mothers should buy this.
B00JU3JMHK|5|Excellent product. Only One suggestion for Company please send extra 3M adhesive with every order, in case kids peel off.
B0073GEFM8|5|This is our granddaughter's best nighttime friend!  The size is perfect, the fur is soft, the face is adorable, the eyes are embroidered rather than buttons, and the tags are silky and soothing.  She always finds one in particular near the top of his head which she puts her thumb in to carry the giraffe - just too cute.
B0000AY9XV|5|We bought this for our son when he was 7 months old. He absolutely loves it. He fights us a little to put him in it but once he is in, he has a ball. He will jump for at least a half hour, but usually longer, before getting tired of it,where as he will only stay in his exercauser for about 20 minutes before wanting out. We took it with us on vacation and it was perfect. I would recommend this brand over the others. I read all the reviews before buying and graco had the best reviews. I would not buy this for a baby under 6 months though. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to put him in and take him out but other than that it is the best toy we have bought for him so far.
B000YJEWC4|5|Great seat and is made with metal supports not just plastic like most others.  Head support is great for my son who falls asleep in the car.  Easy to install and remove.
B005UKRTLI|5|I love this pacifier clip because its long. It also does slide off. I attach it to her bibs and her clothes and it is perfectly fine. She also like the bright colors and playing with it when her pacifier is not in her mouth. The material is nice, better than it looks in the picture. And you can easily wash it. I would recommend this pacifier clip to any parent.
B00BBOZZCM|5|I have nothing to compare this to but it is waterproof and large enough for several wet diapers.
B000B4SVM4|1|We got this as a present when my first son was born.  We tried over and over again to put him in it but every time we did, he got fussy and cried.  We'd move him to the swing, and he'd be happy and fall asleep.  So...we put it away for our next child.<br /><br />We had our second son a few months ago and again, took this out.  Again, just like our first son, our newborn didn't like it.  We kept trying until our son was 4 months old and he never liked it.  So...we gave it away.
B000O3PFVW|2|This was a great sippy at first but after a few throws it leaks just like all the others. Quite disappointed after spending so much. It was also such a pain to clean. Also bought the taller cup for my older child and the plastic would break off from the bottom if dropped. I am getting my kids off sippys all together now and just getting them some regular sports bottles (Kleen Kanteen)
B001I463GM|5|We used this pack in play at the cabin (small space) and it worked perfect for our 5 month old son! It's a great product as the infants become more mobile, it keep them confined in a large space.
B0057GU3HW|5|Putting it together was easy I did it by myself it holds a lot bought for my girls toys and books
B001PGRLLO|3|Shrunk after a few washes, but still a nice blanket
B004D7JGPG|3|I wanted a \\"soft\\" toy box for my 11mo old daughter. She has too many toys now for the small basket she had been using, but was definitely not ready for a big wooden toy box. There were a number of options, and some of them looked more \\"baby friendly\\" but that meant they looked tackier to be on display in the living room. I chose this one because of the neutral color scheme and good reviews. I do not think it was worth the money that I paid for it. It also smells kind of chemically. Also, I usually have to tip it on its side for my daughter to be able to reach everything, but it droops when on its side, because it is not meant to go that way. Finally, for all of her smaller toys, I think everything just gets lost in this. It is bigger than I imagined (a plus for many people, I am sure) and would probably be more age appropriate for kids a little older than mine. I should have gone with the one meant for babies.
B001AXF5EC|5|Works perfectly for my 18 month old. Started using it when he started walking and it keeps him from running away from us, but also gives him the independence to walk without holding a hand. Much cuter than just a leash on him, and he thinks it's a toy to put on.
B00EBZCA1M|5|Easy to apply, great brown color, soft and thick.....sounds like a great company also!
B0090PNYH2|5|My daughter wore this at her first birthday party while she was doing the \\"smash\\" cake. It was cute and functional. It is a bib and does what a bib does. However, its cloth all the way through so there is no moisture catcher. It wasn't a problem for us, but if your baby is a super drooler, it will soak through. Other than that, it's a great bib and makes an excellent keepsake!
B004OR1E3M|5|It is a nice quality set of toddler tableware.
B008RR5XUA|5|This is my favorite stroller! We also have a larger jogging stroller that I bought before baby arrived now we only use our versa and Love it. It works perfectly for the urban life we live over seas where everything is smaller so I need a compact stroller but still need storage for carrying back all our groceries and getting in and out of the smaller shops and cafes. I go everywhere with it and the storage is wonderful the basket can hold a large diaper bag plus a lot more. It's so easy to pack up you can do it one handed. Love that it has the parent facing option my little one likes to look at us while we are walking around. My son loves this stroller he has taken 3 hour naps in it and been cozy the whole time. I give baby jogger a 110% on making this city versa. Perfect for the Mum on the go and shipped to England in less then a week!
B005VLX5RS|5|Perfect for little mouths!
B004FN0ZA8|4|Great seat; however it does pull my daughter's hair sometimes.
B00171WXII|5|When your baby has a stuffy nose, this thing is the absolute best thing! Clears the sinuses so baby can breath again AND mom can get some sleep! I have given out 4 of these as shower gifts and the moms soon found out how great it was to have around.
B00E82MM0M|5|It is a little pricey, but my daughter has always loved aden + anais blankets since she was little.  I love this print.  It is perfect for a toddler's first heavier blanket.  My daughter sleeps with it every night.  I am suspicious that being organic may not have made any difference in the quality, but I liked the pattern so much.  After washing, I also found some slight balling in the blanket.  I don't know how it will last over time, but because it stays in her bed, and we haven't had any leaks lately, I haven't had to wash it much.
B00VNHADCE|4|It actually works!
B00008BR9I|5|My 6-month-old got this for Christmas and loves to play with it. She can be entertained for hours (not at a time of course). The cube has a good size and lots of handles to grab it with - so it's good for a baby who is just learning how to hold things as well. The &quot;target&quot;-top crinkles - which my daughter just loved. The cube has a nice rattle sound inside as well, so it's easy to identify for the baby as well. <BR>It's the perfect combination of color, texture and shape. Very entertaining with an almost 0 frustration factor!
B00E19T3U4|5|Fit mattress perfectly. Soft and warm, perfect for cold winters in Chicago!
B006YPTZRO|3|I was given this as a gift and I'm not thrilled with it. The bulbous bottom is actually more difficult for my daughter to hold onto and the handles are not well-placed. It doesn't seem to leak and it sure is cute. I've just found other products that were preferable.
B006YNM5DC|5|Swaddles seem to help my baby sleep. I feel the difference when he is not wearing them. Sadly, with high temperatures I don't want to use them. Great quality. Washed several times and they did not even fade. The only &#34;bad thing&#34; is when I swaddle the baby after he is asleep, the Velcro is too noisy ;)
B003YH6S16|5|This is a fantastic product, better than any other similar one on the market.  I used to carry a little \\"travel\\" potty seat cover with me to go out, but my toddler struggled with sitting on those comfortably (as apparent from the strained look on her little face) but was also afraid to sit on many of the other plastic or paper coverings I'd attempt to use in lieu of the potty seat and would cry and refuse to use them.  Enter the Cootie Guards.  I plopped my crying toddler on top and she immediately went potty!  I think she was shocked that she was neither falling through the hole nor straddling a mini sized potty seat on top of a much bigger potty.  Aside from just being the exact thing I needed to get my toddler to go in public, these are so much more convenient to carry, can be recycled, and as everyone else has said, are very clean!  LOVE.  Ordered enough to hopefully get us through Kindergarten :)
B005XRV32O|2|I'm always uncomfortable leaving a poor review but with this product I feel I must warn other buyers.<br />This shade looks adorable but it is of very poor quality. It actually fell apart as I unwrapped it!<br />The black trim is just adhesive tape or fusing of some kind which pulled away from the metal frame/harp that attaches to the lamp base. I put it back together and placed it on the lamp only to discover about an hour later  that the shade once again pulled away from the adhesive tape and was sliding down near the hot lightbulb!<br />I rarely return things but this baby is going back for sure!
B00FOL7RWY|5|Well Made. Good Price.
B001M2DBEW|3|It looked bigger in te picture. I know it says bath tub tea set but the pot leaks out the bottom so there's no chance in using it else where.
B002SW3C4O|1|I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because I was looking for something light weight for the summer. It is very light eight, and I was very pleased with it when it arrived. It was smaller than I had imagined as my daughter is small for age- she is 24lbs- and it says the bag fits 22 lbs to  28lbs. There is no way a 28 lb kid would fit into this.  After 3 weeks and maybe 4 wearings and 2 washings, there are two large holes around the zipper seam at the bottom of the bag where the fabric just shredded. For a sleep sack this expensive, I would expect it to last longer than a month! I am very disappointed.
B009KS4PHM|2|The top doesn't easily unzip and it looks pretty cheap in person. I only paid around twenty so I got what I paid for. However, it did have an extra tote and accessories, so that's good. I'm not sure that I'll be using it :(
B005SITEM4|5|A perfect solution to when my 5 year old doesn't want to walk!
B004P1IUZM|3|Perfect for the door!
B00E5LOPB0|5|Well made, and I love the fact that they can be put in the dishwasher and are BPA free.  Have used them every day since I purchased.
B000BNQC58|5|I bought this for my 2 year old nephew for Christmas, and he absolutely adores it!  Every night he wants his turtle and wants to see the stars and the moon.  (All three are new words he's started using since getting the turtle! :D )<br />He still stays in his parents room and they say that the light isn't intrusive to their sleeping at all.<br /><br />Definitely reccommend!
B003Q6CU12|2|I thought I just got a bad monitor but after the third time it happened the metal female adapter for the power plug in at the bottom of the monitor broke off Inside the monitor shortly after receiving the product. Result? The monitor is unable to be charged And the unit becomes a paperweight. I believe it has everything to do with the upright charger monitor holder that ships with the monitor and how it fits into the monitor. It is Engineered too tight. With that said if you just Use a separate mini USB cable you should be fine.  Although I like the unit when it works especially the four camera in one display, the frustration of buying new and sending back is leaving me with giving it only a two star. With that said the 2-3 times I've had to return I've had no problem with either Amazon or Lorax
B00D0IV0GW|2|I was so excited when I found this travel bag. I thought I found the perfect solution for traveling with a stroller.  When I received it I was very disappointed for 2 reasons:  1) According to the product description this travel bag should be suitable for most strollers. My stroller is not considered big and the travel bag barely closes around it, which brings me to my second point...  2) It will be impossible to pack the stroller with one hand (baby in other....) before boarding the plane.  After using the travel bag I can add that it is extremely uncomfortable to pull this around the airport when full.  Bottom line - I would definitely not recommend this product.
B00192EWPW|5|My son weighed about 32 pounds and was a little over 3 feet when I purchased this great product! Easy to handle, wash and take in & out the car!! It makes fastening him in so simple and safe!! I would also suggest purchasing a pillow case ($10 from Babies r us) that attaches to the seat belt so that your little one can also sleep confortably without the rubbing against his/her face.
B000G7NK40|5|Love it.  Fits like a glove. That's about all I can say out this product. I know my twin grandchildren will enjoy sleeping and playing on this.  Thanks so much.
B0088I79AK|5|I am so inlove with this crib, although we haven't used it yet, since i'm not due until October.  We had a very small room and this fit in perfect with the matching dresser and an area rug.
B001GLCLD6|4|My elderly husband was looking for something that would help him use the toilet without messing up the perimeter.  I couldn't find another product in the market place except this one, so we gave it a try.  Since it fits adult size toilets, why not advertise for men and boys??
B0055R6AYS|5|Does what its advertised to do, it protects the g-series while flying, its light and easy to store and makes carrying a folded up stroller easy to carry.  You can use the strap to carry the stroller on your back while walking through the airport
B00F18FMZ4|5|For the price, this mattress works perfectly and is comfortable. It's even pretty comfortable for me to lay on next to my daughter (on the floor). It does have a slight noise to it, due to the waterproof cover, but overall I really like it. I've actually considered buying another for my dogs, and will probably buy this again when my son is ready for a new mattress.
B000LZI2UE|5|THE PRODUCT IS AS SHOWED THE SELLER. The product is of good quality. I RECOMMEND SELLER FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND RELIABILITY.
B006SFUEF2|5|We bought this when our son starts being able to sit up and grab his mobile from his crib.  A year later, it is still kicking.  Our son loves it!  Every night, we put him down at seven, and he just points at the ceiling and says, \\"fish!\\" which is our cue to turn on this projector (on the fish setting of course).  He then quietly looks at it and goes to sleep.  No one can believe how easy this projector has made bedtime, and I recommend it to everyone that has trouble putting their toddlers to bed.
B006VPC5R4|5|Convenient tool for bathtime.
B004L2JJ6E|4|This is an attractive little bassinet that folds up so nicely - it really is perfect for travel, and simple to stick in the car. It could easily fit into a large suitcase as well. I love the little sheet that comes with it, and appreciate how easy it is to fold up/set up.<br /><br />That being said, as many other reviewers have mentioned, the window of usefulness of this product is very short, as baby will not be able to use it once they are 15 pounds or can push up on hands and knees. However, if you plan to travel a lot while your baby is young this would be a perfect product for you. I think it could also come in handy on camping or beach trips to have somewhere for baby to safely nap, as long as they are small enough to still fit in it safely.<br /><br />So in conclusion - I do like this product, it is wonderful for what it is, but I'm not sure if I would pay the full price for its limited usefulness.
B000BN63NE|5|I wasn't looking to spend $20 per changing pad cover- these pads are of great quality, have the holes for the straps to secure baby safely, and are a soft material- not to mention very well priced!
B001G8HNAU|5|This is the second set we have bought and I would recommend them to everyone, they work fantastically, hold up great through the dishwasher and microwave.
B00073HJG8|4|This is just what we needed although I honestly thought that it was going to be bigger...but it works great!
B002LVEK5C|1|Lov the wraps but this one is too stretchy and too hot
B004EBUX8K|2|I went back and forth on what seat to get my daughter when her other expired and settled on this one because the price was great and the idea of lots of padding was great too! I love it so far! It's super easy to redo the straps and its nice that it has latch capabilities and the padding is so nice!! The only gripe I have is that it was such a pain to install (getting the straps really tight) and I've noticed (and I think this is a big deal) that now the latch mechanism loosens after I use the seat!! Big red flag for me. I had this as a 4 star seat but since this is such a huge deal to me I've since lowered it to a 2...it's a bummer because it really would be a great seat otherwise. I've also decided maybe forward facing this wouldn't be an issue but she's still to be rear facing for a few months so we will never know.
B002OOWAB2|5|I have had several portable rockers - usually I purchase the more inexpensive versions as they all look alike.  When I noticed that my son was sleeping soundly in this rocker at daycare I rushed home and purchased it.  I'm not sure why this one is so much better than the others, but it is.  It is the one rocker that my child is happy in!
B002E1B0NE|5|I just purchased this gym for my three month old son-my only regret is not getting it sooner.  He absolutely loves looking at all the contrasting colors and trying to hit the cute animals that come with it.  I also like that the mirror can be moved to different parts of the gym with velcro.  Awesome purchase, especially for the price!
B00762Y5EW|5|Other reviews are right, it did take me ~3 minutes to figure out how to separate the two pieces, but once I did this product is great! I am sorry that I did not get this as soon as I bought my Maclaren stroller-- it's so nice to finally have a place to put a drink! Also, the cup holder expands to fit larger bottle sizes which is nice.  Worth the $!
B001OC5UMQ|4|These will damage the paint on your walls, but they work very well. We have three installed to keep the baby off the stairs and separate the baby and the dog when necessary. Much easier than the type of hate that you have to take off completely.
B00EAD7LF0|5|I absolutely love these decals for my sons room and he does too! They were easy to assemble and do not fall off, which was a concern of mine since I placed them over his crib.  The decals don't look tacky.  They look like they've been painted on, which is exactly what I was looking for!
B002Z4HRXC|5|When the item arrived, it did not work.  I was disappointed, but  then totally satisfied by the quick response from the seller.  A replacement  arrived in a couple of days.  My granddaughter loved  the toothbrush and the singing will make her brush for a  full two minutes. Great product! Outstanding seller!
B00003TL7P|5|The best and most functional one out. My friend has the diaper jeanie and sad it is a piece of junk and doesn't work. I love mine no complaints. No smells, no stupid special bags, and boy can it hold a ton of diapers and keep a room fresh.  I don't know what I would do with out it. It is so good that when I went to Babiesrus they used it in the Mothers Room.
B00D6096AG|4|baby's skin cleared up and is soft and smooth
B000067PRC|5|My \\"Tiny Diner\\" just arrived and I could not be happier with it!  It is very well made, especially for the price.  The suction cups are large enough to hold it down.  How cute is the tray idea??  I was a little worried that the tray would get in my son's way when eating, but it is made of such a flexible material that it is no in the way at all.  I LOVE the way it rolls up so small.  I don't use a diaper bag, just my medium-sized purse and it fits quite well.<br />I will be buying these ar showert gifts from now on!!!  You will not be disappointed!
B00F6K68MI|5|The expected delivery date was between January 12th and January 27th. I figured with it coming from China, that's understandable. Well I got it yesterday on the 20th of December! So far, it's holding everything my older diaper bag did and then some! The changing sheet is super squishy and the bottle holder and extra strap add one are a major plus! Love it so far! I might have to get one in another color now :)
B0012LZD5I|5|PERFECT FOR A GREAT PRICE
B00435RJDY|4|Very cute.  Lots of compliments.  Had powder coat that needed to be cleaned off (no biggie) and this is not a toy for a toddler, meaning you must watch that your toddler doesn't throw it around because it is bendable/not super strong.
B000K53UEI|1|I purchased the First Years drying rack a couple of years ago and used it for my daughter's bottles, my pumping parts, etc. Two issues with it:<br />- The top rack was constantly collapsing onto the bottom one. I solved that by propping it up with a couple of cups, so not a big deal.<br />- The pegs are flimsy and were always falling out. Super-annoying. I guess I could have glued them all in but I didn't try that.<br /><br />I recently had a second baby and set this item up again. I remembered how much I hated it and decided to spring for something new this time around - I tried the Munchkin Sprout drying rack instead. I just finished setting it up and putting a bunch of items to dry on it and I love it. It is much sturdier and looks nicer too. I wish I had given up on the First Years product sooner and saved myself a lot of frustration!
B00FK5I886|5|This adorable stained glass bunny face Switchable nightlight cover appears greenish-pink in the online photo because the milky white glass is iridescent & reflects pastel colors back, like opal or mother-of-pearl.  The shiny silver nose, whiskers & frame around his floppy ears and face are distinctive, and the hanging hook makes this item versatile beyond just a nightlight cover - I will use it as a window suncatcher, joining my other bunny suncatchers in my large bay window at Easter.
B00DCLYU6E|5|So far these are great. The seller is very prompt when contacted. The biggest pain is stuffing the pockets and make sure you use 2 inserts per diaper and for heavy wetters you may need another soaker.
B000059XOD|3|I think a Snuggly is just as good and half the price. This is expensive mainly because it is made of great fabric but it is not that important to pay double. It is also hard to figure out and not great for busty, short women like myself or big and tall men like my hubby. Best bet is to go to the store and try it on and see what you think in person. You  may save money by checking other ones out.
B009R27JJC|4|Expensive but convenient.  A necessary evil for those mid-night diaper changes.  Does a great job sealing in all the gremlins you put inside and makes for a clean disposal.
B004L4CWEI|5|Great way to transport utensils when traveling with kids.
B00186ZQUO|4|This is a very simple to use warmer/sterilizer. It's fast, and instructions are clear (and I like the quick reference card in the built-in pocket). The one flaw is that the on/off switch is temp sensitive, so if you've recently heated a bottle, you have to wait for the unit to cool off before the machine will heat another one.  A drawback if you've more than one kid on the bottle.
B0034G5VCE|3|I wish that each month had a place to put a photo.  An older one that we used for my son had a place for a photo each month- I'm pretty sure that his was the Carter's Wonder version.
B001T9CS06|5|The Maya Wrap has padding on the shoulder area so it makes it much more comfortable than others I've tried. I love the fact that my 2 month old or my 2 year old can fit it. It's worth the money!
B000134XZE|1|Not sure how old these are but they only remotely smell citrusy. Not sure they would deodorize much of anything...and they don't smell pleasant. Not even worth shipping back for the return. Going straight in the trash....oh well
B00MGSPTI2|3|I was disappointed with the product. While there were things we liked it we had the Fisher Price Jumperoo Rain forest Friends to compare this one to.<br /><br />The Luv U Zoo was less expensive than the Rain forest Friends but once you see them both in person it is obvious why.<br /><br />What we like about it (both Luv U Zoo and Rain forest Friends):<br />A jumper with the bungees. Baby LOVED jumping in it!!<br />Toys to entertain but were not overwhelming.<br />Very sturdy (handles jumping VERY well)<br /><br />Did not like about Luv U Zoo(In comparison to the Rain forest Friends):<br />Seat depth. On Luv U Zoo front plastic rested on baby's chest creating  a bright red mark. Also, baby bobbled around in the Luv U Zoo because the seat wasn't deep enough.<br />Leg hole width. On Luv U Zoo they were pretty far apart leaving red marks on baby's legs<br />Toys were noticeably &#34;cheaper&#34; than the Rain forest. Rain Forest had soft toys that hung from the supports where as the Luv U Zoo were just plastic. Other toys activities were also considerably lesser quality.<br />360 seat was on plastic wheels making it harder for baby to turn it around. The Rain forest must be on ball bearings which made turning very smooth.<br /><br />All in all, good sturdy product and lots of fun for baby but would purchase the Fisher Price Rain Forest friends instead...worth the extra $20ish.
B00M8BX132|5|This blanket is AMAZING! its bigger than expected, and amazingly SOFT! I love it and its super cute! Its not really heavy or thick, its perfect. Id buy it ten times over!
B000MVQBG4|5|Perfect bath tub storage for the kids' toys!
B00208RWVK|5|Very cute and effective.
B0062BMLZ8|5|This stuff is God sent fore sure! I hope that the word get's out to all children with colic and they can try this.  It's simply an enzyme and won't hurt even if you find your baby isn't lactose intolerant during the beginning stages of their babies life.
B000GX8DI2|4|Nice, just color not quite as dark as in the picture. Very inexpensive but nice quality. I do recommend this.
B00D56GRVW|4|Awesome. Only thing that's irritating is screen turns off after so long unless plugged in...
B0043AAM9M|1|Extremely disappointed with this item. In the picture it shows that the ducks are yellow, when they arrived they are brownish goldish color.  Also one of the ducts has what looks like a white sticker has been placed over it and torn off.  I order this item to put on a diaper cake that someone ordered from me.  I will be returning it.
B00PRLFSFE|5|Love this socks
B007HKOLD8|4|Perfect. Just what I was looking for :)
B004CQGD7W|5|Works great on our retro stainless steel Highchair...
B002TOKHK8|5|i like it !
B001QKDI48|5|This item is a must have in your diaper bag! I just wish you could choose which color you wanted. That is my only complaint.
B00126ZWRM|5|We purchased our first Picci Moses Basket for our son, who slept in it for the first months. It was absolutely gorgeous-- made in Florence, Italy, of beautiful and soft fabrics. It was a lovely and very pretty addition to our nursery. The Picci is also very functional-- super strong and sturdy, very durable and well-made with reinforced handles. We were able to use this basket to carry baby from room to room in the first few months. The textiles are also made in Italy, and we washed them COUNTLESS times and had no problem at all. They are high-quality, no shrinking and no warping.<br /><br />We were so happy with our Picci that we have purchased additional ones for baby showers as gifts. This version in blue and cream is perfect for a boy's room.
B004044LD4|5|Fits perfectly in the crib. It's firm like a baby mattress should be, and not super noisy like some of the other cheaper baby mattresses. Glad I bought it.
B0042D69WY|3|I purchased this cradle swing from Babies R Us (because it was cheaper with a coupon).  I just got it delivered today.  It was very easy to put together.  It only took about 10 minutes.  It seems sturdy in terms of material, and the cradle part is very sift and cushioned for the baby.<br /><br />I know some people were concerned it was too fast, but I don't see this problem with my baby who's about 10lbs and a month and a half old.  She seems to have grown out of her bouncer as she can wiggle and stiffened her body to get out of it, even with a harness on!  As soon as I put her in the cradle swing, she was calm (even while awake) and is gently being rocked to speak as I'm typing this review.<br /><br />It's easy to change positions, even with baby in the swing from a side to side to a back to front motion.  The motor is very quite.  Another advantage is that it can run on D batteries, or plug into the outlet.  The volume and sound selection works well and it's easy to find something pleasing to baby to hear.  Ours seems to prefer the nature sounds.<br /><br />I think this is a great value for the price and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a swing for their baby.<br /><br />EDIT: We've had this swing now for a month or so.  Some problems we've had is that we'll turn it on and increase the speed, but the motor doesn't kick in.  We have to start the swing in motion before it'll pick and and start swinging her.  While this is happening, it make a very loud sound.  This is particularly problematic because when she's fast asleep, we have to restart the swing again and the sound wakes her up often.<br /><br />Another issue is that the swing turns off after 4 hours.  Since our little one has reflux and can't stand to lay flat in her crib, she sleep much better in her swing.  However, when it turns off on it's own, she wakes up and is upset that she's harnessed in and her movement is restricted.  I think she'd sleep for a lot longer if the swing just kept going.I don't know if ours is defective, or if that's just how they are.
B00008ZCGH|5|I bought these blocks when my son was a month old, he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them. The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby's eye. When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby's touch and they also have a unique feature too. Red and Blue are rattles, Yellow's duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green's frog vibrates when you pull his leg.  <br />These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a $10 value, they will keep your baby entertained and happy.
B002A9IZ0Q|5|I bought two of these for my twins and I love them. They are bigger then I expected and the cribs look stunning!
B005064HY4|4|I like this cover. It is thin material, so my little girl doesn't get too hot, although it is kind of rough. It is big enough although there are times I wish it was just a little bigger. Overall a great deal for the price
B000G2UUBQ|5|More than I expected for the price, quality is great, would highly recommend. to anyone is wanting a girly fantisy room. exceptional quality.
B00O5IU8SM|5|Does all you need. Sound and video. Night vision as well. No need to spend $300 bucks with a bunch of fancy feature.
B008OIPZW8|5|What I like about this compared to the Graco Snugrider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame:<br /><br />The Elite:  The cup holder is permanent, the wheels are much smoother and operate at a much higher level of quality, slightly more narrow so an easier fit in the store or restaurant, tremendously easier closing mechanism<br /><br />Buy this one before the manufacturer realizes that this is the better product and swaps the prices!
B0017ODF6O|5|We bought this along with the Modo changing table [[ASIN:B000Z3BT3Y Babyletto Modo 3 Drawer Changer in Espresso/White]] and the Mercer Crib [[ASIN:B000Z3DWHK Babyletto Mercer 3 in 1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone]] in white/espresso.  All 3 pieces are very well built, solid pieces of furniture.  We actually drove from NY to VA to see the Modo collection in a store that had them on display before ordering from Amazon. I love the drawer underneath so I went with the Mercer crib.  The drawer is nice for blankets and sheets and it prevents anything from going under the crib. There were no nicks or scratches when it arrived, and there was no odor coming from the furniture.  I have a preemie with very weak lungs, so we have to be very careful about odors and chemicals.  The furniture withstood me moving it around about 3 dozen times (no exaggeration) trying different room configurations.  I wasn't supper gentle with it and still no nicks or scratches.  My husband was able to put together all 3 pieces together in about 2 hours. The furniture looks beautiful in the room; very modern, but still cozy. I'm happy with it every time I walk in the room.  Every visitor that sees his room compliments the furniture also!
B0031QPN5M|4|I ordered this after going to babies r us and checking out their gliders. This is much smaller than the $300 glider in those stores which may be the reason it's much cheaper. It will work for my needs but beware it's not the size of one of the gliders you see in the store. Def won't fall asleep in this one. I'm 5'3 and the back isn't high enough for my neck
B002SDD7LQ|4|I've found my baby girl sucks these nipples flat but I remedy that by loosening the top of the bottle so it can vent. Works very well for pumping right into the bottles.
B00QT5YVKU|2|Difficult for me to review. A lot of people already mentioned that the glue doesn't glue. therefor you will need a different one. My son (11 months took it off in 2.3 seconds.<br /><br />I returned the item because if another reason. It smells horrific. And I don't want my son to chew on it, while it is on the table of after he took it down.
B003F6UARE|5|I have had a lot of products claiming to be memory foam but this really is. It's pretty, soft and squishy...perfect for a little one if you're on the go. Rolls up so it's not a space-taker.
B00EUM75MK|4|These training pants are great, are super absorbent and keep number 2's in during accidents
B000G0L2TM|5|The miracle blanket is great for swaddling our little daughter. We were given some blanket from the hospital but she quickly outgrew them. The MB is big and stretchy.
B002LR78RI|5|I was new to cloth diapering when our son was born and didn't know where to start, how many supplies I needed, how long the diapers last etc etc.  I knew I wanted to use a prefold and cover system, so when I stumbled upon this complete pack I snapped it up and haven't looked back.<br />This set literally contains everything you need for cloth diapering, from the time your child is born to the time they're potty training, and the cost is a drop in the bucket when compared to what you would spend on buying disposables for 2+ years.<br />The cotton diaper stays fluffy and super soft and unlike other brands, I haven't had any rashing or chafing with the Real Nappies PUL cover.<br />I was excited to see that Real Nappies also offers a two child guarantee on all of their products, so if you're thinking about cloth diapering, this Birth to Potty pack is a great investment.
B000WJLKQM|3|Great little jumper for the doorway, but it is not as adjustable as I expected. Our doorway is standard height but in order to make it further from the ground for our 6 month old I have to loop it. Otherwise he is too close to the ground to jump.
B000058DNE|5|I have a 1 yr old grandson that I babysit.  I attached these bugs to my furniture drawer pulls, and then I hold the bug up, describe it to him, and \\"fly\\" it up and down and round and round, changing the buzz sound I make to correlate.  The little bug \\"talks\\" to him, saying \\"Hi Cole, won't you play with me, etc\\".  You can make the bug \\"zap\\" him for fun, or play tag when he tries to grab it. <br /> <br />My grandson is intrigued and excited about the bugs.  They are so cute, you can count the legs, point out the facial features, colors and shapes on the bug, and say \\"low\\" and \\"high\\" when you move the bug around.  <br /> <br />I think they are educational and inspire imaginary play in our young ones, but it takes an adult to make it happen!
B000GUZC2A|5|baby's favourite!
B00028YSU8|5|I received this as a shower gift and at first wasn't sure if I would use it.  After bringing by son home from the hospital I was surprised how much easier it made breast feeding.  Now that my son is a month old I put him on the pillow to feed and I am able to have a hand free so I can read.
B0035KM6RW|5|I couldn't find these in at Target, Walmart or the grocery store, so I purchased them on Amazon last year for Christmas (2010) for my hard core Little Einsteins fan.  He loved them and continues to use them all the time!  I actually found this set at Marshall's a couple months ago (Summer 2011), so they're floating around, but nevertheless still hard to find outside Amazon.  No problems with leaking.
B00AA6LQKM|4|We have been using these to make freezer pops for our teething infant.  The only complaint is the 'lock' mechanism is a little flimsy.  Otherwise no issues and the shape and size of the popsicles is perfect for her tiny teething mouth.
B0044UQ3TY|5|I saw these bags featured on Good Morning America and decided to try them.  We absolutely love them.....they are \\"green\\", easy to clean (love that you can throw them in the washer), and really well made.  Not to mention they come in really cute patterns.  We don't leave home without them and you will always find one in our car and diaper bag.  Great for road trips, picnics, or trips to the park!
B0007ICPOE|5|These are wonderful!! This is my third set, Its a great keepsake! When mixing, add little water, and mix, add a little more, and mix til you get it perfect.
B000RHYPS4|5|My 6 month old son and I both love this , it is a great buy !!!!!!! My child loves to sit and hang with the bug ppl and nice that he can sit comfortably without me holding him
B003XMWF5A|2|The plastic coating bubbles up, then chips off, with use.  I have no idea if it is toxic, so I have to toss it.
B000056OUF|1|Well, I too bought the bottle warmer and didn't think for a second that it doesn't include things like automatic shut off or timer. I thought that is the whole purpose of the bottle warmer. Basically after 3 months of using it I gave up because I find myself forgetting to turn it off and having the milk too hot. I now use my electric kettle. My very pretty and expensive (I may add) bottle warmer became a gadget collecting dust.
B00006H3DA|5|We were thrilled to find this wonderful seat. It looks good against our leather seats, and the cup holder is great and removable for cleaning. It's easy to set in place, easy to buckle in, and my daughter is comfortable in it.      Best of all, it was delivered to our door quickly, and the price was GREAT!!
B000056HMV|5|I have this breast pump and have been using it for 9 months.  I just stopped breastfeeding.  You can use it anywhere because it has a battery option and a manual option.  A baby bottle screws right onto the bottom.  I don't see any need for special breast milk containers.  I much prefer the one breast at a time models.  I used to use the more expensive two breast model when my daughter was a preemie and still in the hospital.  I thought it was a pain in the butt because it has so many parts to clean.  It may be quicker to pump both breasts at once, but then you have to clean twice as many parts.  This pump has only two pieces which have to be cleaned after each use.  That is if you use the same baby bottle to store the milk as you use to feed the milk.  Compare this with around eight pieces for the two breast at a time models.  If you don't have time to wait for the dishwasher to run or the dishwasher is not full, then you have to wash them all by hand for as many times a day as you pump your breasts.  It can get really annoying.  I noticed someone else mentioning that their pump's motor stopped working.  I have to slap mine against my hand once in a while to get the motor going.  Don't ask me why.  I expect to use the same pump for my future children.  Mine still works.
B00BI372GI|5|PowerClix are wonderful toys for children ages 2+ (even though the recommended age on the product is 5+ 0 just be sure to supervise well). Children love the different colors, cool magnetic connection between pieces, and variety of shapes. They can be used to build a variety of structures, like bridges, cubes, spheres, buildings, and more! Clean up is easy, too. This is a great way to target fine motor and visual-spacial skills.
B00BVZ7D58|2|I love love love their pacifiers, but this struck out. She could not figure out wear to chew or fit it in her mouth. I should just toss it, taking up room in her favorite play yard, a pampers box. ;)
B00TR5A8WY|3|The bed was easy to assemble and our 2 and a half year old loved it...while she was awake. When she slept in it she hit her head against the side of the bed when she shifted during sleep since the bed is all made of wood.<br />I bought the bed because of the reviews I read and because it is a floor unit meaning our girl can't fall out of it onto the floor. Unfortunately, I have to drape towels over the sides and head board to protect her while she sleeps. That's not a huge deal except that it deters from the appeal of the decoration.<br />Also, the ad says that this bed is interactive. Nothing on this bed is interactive. Lastly, I thought the bed came with the pillow since the seller answered a customer question saying this bed comes with everything on the photo except the sheets( I believe )
B00000J4TE|3|We both liked thjis item but felt it should come w/ more hanging items.  We had to buy 5 more to keep our little one happy.
B004QQMYAI|5|I was skeptical about this product considering the great price.  However, the application was VERY simple and the final product looks great!  Additionally, the seller was accomodating and sent me the color of my choice with no problem.  Don't think twice, this is a great find!
B006JDGYXE|5|Very cute
B004O6M4M8|5|wonderful
B004FNB0TS|5|My granddaughter Loves this teething rattle. I'm so glad she takes such joy in it.
B0000DBHHR|3|We purchased this gate for the top of the stairs. We live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell I suppose. Installing this gate was a great pain! We could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase Toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall....so a toddler putting LOTS of force on it would not rip the gate-and the drywall out- thus tumbling down the stairs. ALSO, we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around/over the molding, it didnt work for us. We had to install the gate ABOVE the molding thus leaving a 4 to 5 inch GAP from the floor to the gate. This is BAD! Our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first. Luckily I am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her (small townhouse!) and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs. I have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so I have nothing else to compare it to. Hopefully it is only that I live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks.  <br /> <br />NOTE: It does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up PERFECTLY or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly. I do however, like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle. While I still had problems using it as a top of stair gate, I do think it would work very well as a doorway gate.
B00568MOPK|5|We have bought several of these for our newborn's changing table.  They work great.  Good size and waterproof.  Easily fold up for travel.
B004071ZOY|5|I bought a pink and a blue one, we are having a set of twin grandbabies!! They are super cute and soft.
B000O7WNVI|4|I really like the color and how soft it is. The only problem I have is that it doesn't seem to last as long as other bassinet sheets. I bought 3 of them (2 green and one vanilla color). I've had this product for 7 months and there is already a hole in one of them. The thing is, I wash it regularly because my son will sometimes spit up on the sheet. Overall, I like the comfort of it for my son but I feel the material is lacking a bit. Could be stronger to make it log lasting.
B00E3UPZZS|4|But I can tell I'm going to enjoy using it in a month or so, the quality is really good!
B00MHP8YKO|5|This is one of the best items we bought for our baby. Very practical and keels baby clean. I'm so glad I bought this. The pillow worked great to support my daughter and the color is just beautiful. This a must have for every parent. The quality is great. It's a bit bulky but I don't mind.
B002LARFLY|5|My sons favorite Towel.
B00C2KW3FG|1|This cute little bed was wonderful and worked amazing until trying to transition my baby into a flat crib. It was the most impossible task!! She never learned how to sleep flat so she was terrified and miserable whenever flat. Please consider this when thinking about purchasing this rock n play!
B003R4TF70|3|Item arrived as displayed but the metal isn't very strong.  I guess an item that's meant to hang on a wall doesn't need to be titanium though lol.  I'm satisfied.
B00DJPK8MS|4|My kids love this
B002WD9NY2|5|Exactly what I needed.
B001AH8JXC|1|I purchased this bed for my 2.5 year old boy.  I was excited that it arrived so quickly.  This bed was also super easy to install and I did it by myself in a little under an hour.<br /><br />The reason I am so disappointed in this bed is because as my son climbed into it for his first nap all the while smiling and stating \\"my new bed\\" it broke from underneath him.  The pieces that hold the matress on the bed are so flimsy that it broke under a second of weight from a toddler who could not weigh any more than 30 pounds.
B003DNS9XG|2|Doesn't stick to my tub thay great
B007B5GTMU|5|It's perfect. My kid loves it.
B006YPTZOM|1|I should have paid more attention to the product, with an active chold (as most are) a stationary straw is useless.  I needed a product with a weighted straw to move with the liquid as my daughter shifts and moves.  Assembly was a challenge compared to comparable and lower priced products.
B0044MURW6|5|Very easy to roll out smoothly and use. Easy to redo and adding a little water is possible if it starts to dry before you are finished. You do need to press down quite hard to get a good imprint.
B000JHM318|2|The safety straps that were on the chair were of poor quality and not safe.   The crotch strap was not sewn correctly and would not fit on the crossbar as intended.  The latch mechanism, on the seat belt, is partially broken and will not stay snapped when child moves. Child could fall out of chair.   I would hope that I get a response from the seller. [[ASIN:B000JHM318 Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Mahogany]]
B003917CNA|5|ripes well on the ikea wooden holder , nice heavy paper that holds up to a 3 year olds heavy handed coloring
B004JU0H6O|5|My son sleeps on this most of the time since he doesn't like to sleep in his main crib. It seems comfortable but it is very firm and a little noisy when he moves.
B001ULYG80|2|This bassinet is cute. But seems cheaply made. Had to order another mattress as the one that came with it was terrible. Didn't seem to be 1inch at all. The bottom frame should be made with thicker wood. I would not purchase this again or recommend.
B009K0Z7PO|5|Gave to my 2 year old great-niece for her birthday(even though says 3+) and she loves it. When it's quite time before naps she has something to help relax. Nice colors and adorable graphics.
B0033AGAEE|2|it was very easy to put together but my 7 month old isnt very entertained by the table he wants to get out of it after less than 5 monutes and I only had this toy for a week. If you have carpet I wouldnt recommend it its hard for it to rotate. I only give it 2 stars because it was simple to put together but as far as the toys on the table to entertain a child they could of been better.
B001EU35BQ|5|this is a great chair , its sturdy and very well build. i have a 6 month old daughter that i feed in that chair and i like to put a little padding so she sits a little higher that gives her a better reach on her toys she has on the tray, and speaking of a tray this is the bigest tray you can get and i love that about that chair. bigger she gets ill be able to put her in it to color and do her little projects. the vinyl seat cleans easily and its very comfortable my 2 year old niece fell asleep in it many times . overall great chair
B006UMUB92|5|worked perfectly easy to install
B00CYRYUXU|5|I happy with this buy.. you see that it's very good quality hooks And easy to use it.
B00QHK8JK0|5|Great product.
B00AA6LQKM|4|Works well, but my baby's not very into them! lol.
B00A6GID16|5|Im very pleased with this purchase. I've gotten many usage and this wet bag is still standing. I love it!
B004LE8XLO|2|Towel is darling....grandson liked it.....when opened new product looked good....after one washing not so good....material is of poor quality....too expensive for quality of product:(
B0030V2P4K|5|I have a 1.5 year old, and a 3 year old.  We used this product the last time we all went to a music festival together.  It's easily attachable, and removable (no tears), and simple to write on.  We put our names and cell phone numbers on, and just slapped it on them.  It didn't bother them at all.  They love tattoos, so they enjoyed it in all reality.  Also, it was the middle of the summer, and they were rolling around in the dirt and grass, and the tattoos stayed put until we removed them.  I definitely recommend for traveling parents with kids that haven't memorized the necessary contact information yet.
B007NG5UF4|5|I did a lot of research before buying a monitor, and am glad I purchased this one.<br /><br />There is very very minimal white noise. Both the monitors I had used with previous children had a lot of static and would sometimes keep me awake at night. I have heard white noise once from this monitor. It was during a storm and not loud enough to be bothersome.<br /><br />The part that goes in the childs room has a night light on the top that you can turn on and off from the parent unit. It's a great feature, I do however, wish that the light could be turned on/off using the baby unit. Or that it would go off on its own after a set time. But it is a nice feature.<br /><br />The parent unit has a light system to guage how loud the noise is, I haven't really found this useful yet, but I guess it's a way to have the volume on low and be able to tell if the baby is crying or just talking. I know my so hums himself to sleep sometimes, so it might help in a situation like that.<br />Another feature I haven't found useful with the baby is the two-way talk. That isn't to say I haven't used it though. I use it quite frequently to call my other son to me without having to yell across the house. I just haven't found a way to use it for the baby. But I still love that it has the capability.<br /><br />All in all, this product does exactly what is it is intended for and does it well. I love it and have recommended it to all my friends having babies and even bought one as a baby shower gift.<br /><br />I also want to note that I live in an 1110 square foot apartment. I have reception from everywhere in the apartment. I don't know if there are any other monitors in the building, but there are other babies and small children, and I have never had any interferance.
B0042G8YCY|3|Look I have a 6 month old and the necklace was pretty but it didn't help her teething... If your looking for a teething solution this is not it.
B005BWXJ8W|4|Our son was biting the crib railing so I quickly ordered this. It matches our breathable bumpers well and keeps him from biting the crib with no problems so far. The only downside is we have a graco crib and the outside railings are too thick to tie the ends to. It is still secure though without the ends tied and the ties are short so they shouldn't pose a safety risk.
B004CLD3TI|5|Great strong gate!<br /><br />It does take some extra work to install the extenders, but it's really not that bad.<br /><br />Would not really recommended installing it against drywall, because it does close hard and it's metal, so it does require some decent pressure to mount against a wall, which could damage your drywall.<br /><br />We installed ours at a angle, between two door jam openings, using the included hardware. Turned out great for this OCD parent.<br /><br />Surprised this gate does not have higher reviews.
B00AW0MZF6|4|Love that all elements of this pack and play is washable.  Appreciate the slight tilt in the bassinet portion to help with gassy baby.  It's not as packable or easy to fold but perhaps it's because the plastic is new.  I appreciate the built in organiser next to the changing table.  Very thoughtfully constructed.
B007CTPWXW|4|I purchased this for my Britax B-agile stroller and it's a great addition. The insulated cup holders keep my beverages cold and snug so that nothing falls out. I love that the center area has magnet closure. It makes for quick access and it's great for storing my cell phone and keys. The reason for 4 stars is because the organizer doesn't hang straight down, it hangs at bit of an angle. It's a personal pet peeve that doesn't affect the performance of the product at all.
B000LK6KOO|1|my son loves these cups, but they are difficult to clean, they get moldy fast and he easily chews the rubber straw off. I had to purchase 10 on here because he destroys them so quickly. Also, he has smashed a could just throwing them and the actual bottle breaking. But because he loves them so much I have to keep buying lol.
B006QH43Y0|5|This was a great buy. Really happy with the trolley. It is light, easy to push, very easy to fold, and perfect for travel, and also for everyday small trips.<br />Do not regret buying this, and have already recommended this to friends
B0077ER9BU|5|It'so beautiful!!!
B00BJO98DQ|4|I got this unit as a monitor for our our babies - two very active Labrador Retrievers who tend to get into all sorts of trouble.  For years we had been joking about wanting to monitor just what it was they were doing when we were out of their sight.  The Levana Keera 32012 Remote Controlled Pan/Tilt/Zoom Camera with 3.5-Inch Screen was absolutely perfect for this task!<br /><br />The instruction manual was skimpy and a little confusing, but we were able to try out the unit. The picture is a bit pixellated and the colour is not that great. Of course, I am not sure what other reviewers who complain about the picture quality are expecting. As a filmmaker and someone who is around security cameras, even higher end systems can have issues with picture clarity, refresh delays, etc.  I found the unit great for the price and we were able to solve a few mysteries around the house as to which of our fur babies is the instigator and acts out the most.
B0050P2P3A|3|Smaller than I was expecting.
B00E11SSAI|5|I just received these. These are perfect for a toddler who likes to put food...everywhere :). They are much larger than a typical bib. I was originally looking at bibs with the pocket to catch food, however I read that those are not comfortable with a high chair. These are perfect. They are long enough to go down and even curl up to catch food or over their legs. We had quite a messy dinner last night and none made it on their clothes. I call that a success :) I can also see these making great art smocks.
B0070WGV9K|4|We moved our 3 year old from a toddler bed to a big boy bed.  This bed rail works perfectly.  It's very secure and doesn't move even when he flops around and kicks on it through the night (he often wakes up in his bed sideways).
B002OCAE3U|5|I can't say enough good things about this seat. I knew I wanted one because of the high rear facing limits but I was a little nervous about ordering one because I'd never tried it out before. I will say that there is a little bit of a learning curve. I am car seat obsessed and I've had many different seats for my kids and this one took me a good 30-40 minutes to get it all figured out. Putting it in the car was fairly easy though, I got it nice and tight by myself without much trouble. My daughter loves it and she is still very comfortable rear facing at almost 3, 38 inches and 34 pounds.
B004GCJMLG|5|work perfect
B001TWI81G|5|I use these for my baby's bottle bag. One square broke but who cares they work great and for the price I can buy a bunch of them. I have been using one of the mats that came in the pack for 4 months 3 days a week for the babysitter and only one square broke. If you lay flat in  your freezer and lay flat once thawed I don't think they would break at all. I blame myself for the one square breaking.
B00WHO5SCM|5|Same review as the Greenbuds kids pillow case. I really like the cover with the clouds. It washes very well and it stays soft after multiple washings. I like the envelope closure.
B00JWG14IU|5|Excelente
B00J94NNDO|5|Not sure what's wrong with Cassandra, but this product worked out just fine.  Once you unroll it and apply with a credit card it looks great!
B001OE1PC8|4|Works great but when you are carrying child on hip it's a tight squeeze.
B00404AKR0|4|I got this set of blankets before our baby was born to take to the hospital and have baby cozy. That didn't work as I planned. They're not really flannel blankets, but they're cotton at least. We hand wash all our baby washables, so my blankets are still in great shape after 3 months, but I'm pretty sure if I were to machine wash these specific blankets they would be cleaning cloths by now. Another big flaw in these blankets is the fact that it is right next to impossible to get them folded just right. They're oddly shaped and there is just no way to make them fold well, but I realize not everyone is as crazy as me when it comes to folding a blanket (I must sound insane, lol!)<br />I give this set 4 stars cuz they're very pretty colors for our girl, VERY soft fabric and the size is good. Like I said, I don't think they would stand too many machine washes, even less a dryer, but for us that is no problem at all. I hope this helps
B0042D69V0|4|Easy to assemble and to adjust.
B00005C45K|1|I purchased this product for my son to use at the beach this summer.  I used it one day and was careful to follow all the folding instructions.  The next time I went to use the product I was shocked to find out that the wire had snapped at the top.  I no longer feel this product is safe for my baby to use.  I have seen similar complaints about this product so I do not believe my product was defective.
B001NPD742|5|I was surprised how easy this was to install in our Honda Accord. I love it- my kiddo loves it.   The only criticism I have it that it takes up a good chunk of room in the middle seat. Not sure how much room there would be if we had 2 car seats back here. Also, adults are a bit cramped next to it. I'm still very glad we got it and the ease of installation was key!
B002ZYNTSY|5|If you pump, Pump Ease is a must have!  Prior to using Pump Ease I dreaded pumping.  Now I can be hands-free when I pump!  Follow other reviewers' advice and determine your proper size on the sizing chart.  I would have assumed that I needed a large (currently wearing 36F), but the sizing chart indicated that I need a medium.  The chart is correct.  Pump Ease is definitely snug, but it needs to be so it can hold everything in place.  You won't be disappointed with Pump Ease!
B002WTANQS|5|No improvements necessary--and I always have ideas for improvement.<br />Works like a charm.  Very secure.<br />Wish they made them for larger babies.
B000056OV0|5|If you have the space to store such a huge tub--then buy this one. It is wonderful! I tried three other tubs before this one and only regret not buying it sooner. Your baby will be perfectly and safely positioned when tiny and can use the more spacious side for serious splashing when they can sit up. This tub deserves 10 stars at least!
B00BUBNZC8|5|Love it
B001OC5UNK|5|It's easy to install and easy to take down.  I have a 47.5&#34; entry and use all three segments.  Aside, from my bully running through and knocking it down a few times when he first arrived (he really doesn't know his own strength) it has served its purpose very well for keeping my dogs in their designated area.
B001F43JTO|5|My daughter called all her pacifiers her &#34;duck&#34;. She loved this and we never lost it and it held up a long time. Worth it.
B001KZJY2O|1|We had to return this pillow. It was lumpy and not usable. We had bought this same pillow for our son 3 years ago and he loves it. He still uses it and it still has consistent filling throughout and works well. But this new one we bought for our daughter is awful. The quality has totally gone downhill. Such a disappointment as we love our son's pillow and I have sewed a bunch of pillowcases for it over the years that I was hoping to reuse.
B0050P2P3A|5|I bought this back pack for my 1.5 year old to use for the Toddler program she attends.  It is slightly big on her, but she still loves wearing it.  Her older sister, 3.5, also has one and it fits her just right.  It is big enough to carry toys, artwork, dance shoes, extra clothes and also has the lined pocket which we have not used yet and it seems to be a good size.  Both are super cute (the peace sign and the star are the ones we have) and seem to be holding up very well!
B001IY2SPW|5|We live very rural so bugs are an issue almost year round.  They've been bad enough this year I haven't hardly been able to take my little one outside very much.  This is absolutely awesome & being Jeep made is a bonus
B001HY40P4|5|Bought this for my eight month old for trips to grandma, where there is no crib.  Head clearance is a small issue but otherwise works great.  On-line videos show how to straighten and fold.
B00NBICJQG|5|SLP approved!
B00DB3HHAO|5|Very happy with this.
B00320UQLI|5|My 5 year old chews on his clothes.  I bought this necklace in an effort to save necklines.  So far he has loved it and I love it too!
B000MQQR7W|5|Item exactly as described
B003SPODNE|1|The sport caps 2.0 and 3.0 both leak when closed and squeak when you drink from them.  The vent valve acts like a reed and chirps like a bird. No good at work or class.  Made in China too!  This is the best available bottle? Wow.
B002CVTL7I|1|Received this as a gift from relative for Baby's 1st birthday. When I started to put it together I started to get leary about the quality. I had a lot of trouble opening and closing the stroller and felt as thought I would pinch my fingers in the metal each time I tried. This ultimately led me to open instructions to see if I was doing something wrong (no) and the instructions are written in broken english with sentences that don't even make sense (something about not letting baby nurse use stroller?) I laughed so hard I cried, but I also never put my child in it. I had to have the uncomfortable conversation with relative to return it as I certainly did not want to chance my baby's safety.
B000FTDWFQ|5|So glad I found this for my 7 month old! Once he started fighting his diaper changes I had to find something to keep him occupied. This is perfect; just out of his reach and interesting enough to keep his attention. Sometimes he does grab at the wings on the way down- the good thing is they pop right off and he can hold them (he thinks he has something he shouldnt so its great!) and they pop right back on. Highly recommended for the changing table!
B002BSGWSS|5|EXCELLENT
B000LCDUUY|5|Love! Love! Love this tub!!! My son is 5 months old and it holds him in place but also allows him to splish splash the whole time. ....he loves bath time more than ever!!!! Much better than the smaller version tub!
B000HCMUJU|2|These bags are cute and serve a good purpose of keeping you organized, but could use some refining.  The \\"Dirty Bag\\" is nice and big, but has mesh backing (along with all the others).  Who really wants to put poop stained paints in a mesh bag?  The smaller bags for \\"goodies\\" and \\"extras\\" are just a little small. Lastly and most importantly, 2 of my bags have already torn at the top seam on the mesh side after very light use.
B00K75FW56|5|Love it
B00F6TZARS|5|Our daughter loves this toothpaste. She always gets excited when it is time to brush her teeth and hasn't cried or refused being brushed yet. It doesn't have fluoride, but studies have shown the xylitol works well at preventing bacteria formation and tooth decay.
B00IJJRVR4|5|Purchased for my wife for use in Australia as a cheaper option than the Medela Swing recommended to us by lactation consultant.  In order to use in Australia we purchased a step-down transformer in Aus for approx. $20. Even with shipping, this was a significantly cheaper option than a local Australian retail purchase. My wife has used it 6+ times per day (using 1 pump only) for the last 3 months and has had no issues at all with the pump. So far it appears to be a real workhorse. Recommended. The only comment for use in Aus, would be that in combination with a step-down transformer this option would not be classified as &#34;portable&#34; and would be better suited to use in the home only.
B00FRS2C2E|2|The pillow itself is awesome but there was no zipper cover in the box.., I was disappointed about that...
B00D3P9G3G|5|Best teether that we have found!
B003NWPOGW|4|This stroller is super light and handles very well. I am very happy with the canopy coverage and the sturdy feel of the stroller. The only reason why I did not give this 5 stars was because if the small basket. I would've preferred a slightly larger compartment.
B002RL808Y|5|I got this in on sale on Amazon. It showed up on time and I love it.  The only thing we don't love are the straps.  He screams every time I put his arms in there.  Other than that, easy assembly, sturdy...
B006QI1PBI|5|Got this for my son for his first easter basket!! He loves it!!! Shakes it all the time !! Recommend this to all babies for there first easter!!!
B00006966I|5|My baby has been using these since he was a newborn. He is still using the stage 1 nipple at 3 months of age. I tried upgrading to the 2nd stage nipple but he sucks too hard on them taking too much; and get's frustrated. He goes through the formula pretty fast on the stage 1 nipple and I have not had a problem with them. We do boil them at least once a week (mother in law thing) I use the dishwasher and they are fine. I just make sure they are properly assembled each time and he loves them.
B003HEG7WQ|5|Craftsmanship is excellent.  easy to clean and durable.  Turns heads everywhere we go! Perfect size for my 1 1/2 son.  Ample storage.  LOVE IT!!!
B00I4Y7J3K|5|My child loves it  , and it's a perfect fit he's three years old and he still has plenty of room to grow I it ..
B002RXM9M0|4|Just needed something to hang my ladies hats on,  they were everywhere
B00375MZCG|5|This crib was delivered promptly to our home.  Upon opening we discovered the hardware was missing.  A phone call was made and the missing hardware was sent out immediately.  The assembling of the crib was easy.  It looks very nice and our son loves it.
B002QYW8LW|5|Nephew bananas over Baby Banana bendable Training toothbrush and teether!!!!! He has to have it with him all the time.
1592923011|5|My niece Loved this little book. I love ladybugs, so we both are happy:)Anyway, glad I purchased this item, and always enjoy Amazon giving me a great deal!
B004MWJP62|5|My twins just turned one and we're trying to transition from a bottle (Dr. Brown's to be exact) and they would just not drink milk from a sippy cup for more than a few sips. We have the smaller Nuk sippy cups, which they love for water or juice (and they have same silicone spout as this one) but kept fussing for milk in a bottle.. I think the extra height on this sippy cup makes it seem more like their bottles. They were delivered today and I had to write a review because since using them for the first time earlier, they haven't had a bottle!!! The twins BOTH went through 2  (6 oz) &#34;feedings&#34; and one small snack already without fussing for their bottles.. These are great and I'll be ordering more soon!!!
B00I3LDYB0|5|There are many to choose from when it comes to monthly stickers for your baby (I don't think this was around when I was a kid). I chose these because the color weren't so bright and obnoxious and others I saw. Also the focus remains on my baby, not a licensed character or neon theme. I love them and they stick really well to clothing.
B002UD65XQ|5|no comment
B004X0WBHS|5|I bought this for my 4 month old grandson.  It was love at first sight. He started to explore it with his hands, feet, and mouth.  He loves all the moving parts and the noise the ball toy makes. There are just so much on this ball that a baby can play with. It has become one of his favorite toys; his father confirms this.  The toy has \\"staying power\\".
B00O2VQZ8O|5|Great.
B000J3ZGYS|5|My grandson looked adorable in his costume and he will be able to wear it again later on as well because it is very durable!!!
B002W5V71C|4|The Letter D is very cute and I like the color and the distressed edge to show the wood color under the red color. I was anticipating a  Letter D to stand on its own, and thought the attaching to the wall was an option. So if a buyer is thinking the same way as I did, know that the letter isn't able to stand up on its own. I wanted it to stand on a shelf. So Now I will attempt to get it to stand up using a double stick adhesive strip, hoping that I can still get the same results that I was expecting. This is the reason for 4 stars verses 5 stars. I would suggest the seller add this little detail to the description so that other buyers will know that this Letter D will fall over and not stand up on its own. Otherwise, I really like it! Shipping was very fast coming from Amazon.
B004ZT6H5E|5|I am so happy to have a new granddaughter so I can shamelessly enjoy my favorite books by sharing them with her.  If I Were a Hippo is both amusing (whether you are 63 days old or 63 years old) and also introduces a tactile experience that little ones will  love.
B00I3YFJ24|5|Really great stroller.  We have owned a bumbleride (similar 3 wheel ~$500 stroller) for almost 2 years, and are having our second baby so wanted to get a stroller that could hold both kids.<br /><br />Right out of the box the phil and teds stroller appears very and solid.  It weighs a little more than the bumbleride but is still very managable.  It has a fairly large footprint overall but this is needed to be able to have room for two kids.  Notably though the stroller folds to a remarkably compact size, and what is really impressive is that it folds to the same small size even with the second seat in place.  Adding in the second seat at least to the rear &#34;two toddler&#34; position only adds a single simple step to folding up the stroller.<br /><br />The stroller is very stable feeling when walking.  Both seats are very secure, minimal bouncing around even in the second seat.<br /><br />The stroller can be used for jogging, the front wheel will lock in place, I haven't tried it with two kids in place but would probably be a little difficult.  Its not a jogging stroller but for short jogs that aren't too fast its pretty useable.<br /><br />Overall very impressed, compared to the bumbleride it feels like you are getting much better engineering and design for a $500-750 stroller depending on attachments.  I'd highly recommend.
B00T53LCLY|4|I have tried several products and what I appreciated the most about this product was the dropper and how exact it was. It was very easy to measure out one drop.
B00OEX1T18|4|Does not say in description but placemat is meant for pets. The tag is labeled for pets when received.
B000056J7L|5|My wife and I bought this chair for our grandson to use when he comes to visit us.  I believe there were 765 reviews of this product!  Amazing!  We've raised three daughters so the anatomical challeges of potty training a little boy were new to all of us. The pictures don't really do the chair justice.  The chair, from front to back, is actually much deeper than it appears, which is GREAT!  The shield up front is much higher than it appears, which is GREAT!  Our grandson was obviously uncomfortable using the &#34;conventional&#34; training toilet he had at home.  One visit and the toilet went home with our daughter and son-in-law.  Our grandson is completely toilet trained in less than 2 weeks.  We all agree that this toilet played a huge role in his rapid success!<br />Quality product, well designed!  Highly recommended!
B003WKZ4Y2|3|This was supposed to help a nine month old go to sleep and stay asleep.  It really didn't make much of an improvement in her sleep pattern and the sounds this machine makes is very weird. Fortunately it wasn't that expensive so we can pass it along and perhaps it will work for another child.
B007U1UR8C|3|I love the idea of a tray on my stroller for my child, but she can't reach it.  My oldest is 21 months, and the tray is so far forward that she cannot get her water cup out of the cup holder.  She also cannot get snacks out of the snack tray without spilling half of them while attempting to do so.  She has to grab the tray holder and pull herself forward just to make the attempt, and she is in the 80% for height for her age.  Basically, it seems the tray is not designed for a child less than 2 years of age.<br /><br />My other complaint about the tray is that it is small.  The cup holder in the middle takes up most of the tray space, so you cannot put any other containers on the tray.  Some snacks can be placed in the open sections next to the cup holder, but of course, then you're washing the tray frequently as your child is eating directly off of it.<br /><br />Nice idea...poor design, but I don't have any other options with this stroller for now.
B001870OJ6|5|My 2.5 year old daughter was super excited when we got the box and wanted to get into the seat immediately.  She loves how well it fits her and that she can sit up straighter than her old seat.  She likes that it looks like a race car seat.      I like the head protection, the ease of adjustment and the ease of installation.  Literally, I got it into the car in about 5 minutes, just connected the lower LATCH anchors and the upper tether and it fit great.  Really simple.  Just remember to adjust it to the appropriate height for your child before tightening it down.
B0035459NG|5|We just got this stroller off Craigslist and it was barely used.  We just tried it out tonight and I LOVE it!!  This will make our upcoming air travel so easy.  I love that it's truly a one-hand fold and it's so easy to push, my 2 year old was pushing it around!  Now to write a review about the accessory pack...
B006SFUEF2|5|I had a friend give my husband and I the homedics brand projector and white noise generator.  We started just using the white noise generator, but eventually, we started adding the projector to use as a nightlight.  It did have a timer.  However, if my son woke in the middle of the night and it was off he would start crying.  We would have to go in and turn in back on.  Because we had to have it on all night long so we could get some sleep, the project died after a few months.  We purchased another one.  This Homedics one did last a few months longer, but it too froze one night and would not start back up.  It took three time as long to get my son to go to sleep without the both the white noise and the projector running.  The next night I went out and purchased the last one that Target had on the shelf.  When I turned on the projector, it barely moved.<br /><br />My husband and I were fed up and wanted to find a better model.  I searched on Amazon and found this Munchkin projector.  I read the reviews and put faith in the positive ones and decided to give it a try.  One aspect that drew me to it was the noise activation feature.  I got one in the mail a few days later.  We immediately fell in love with the better graphics which had the same themes as the Homedics projector, but more colorful.  It had a better sound quality as well.  We tried out the timer with the noise activation feature and it works great!  Since we don't have to have this projector on all night, it should last a bit longer.  We've already been using it for over 2 months with no complaints.
B002VOFOOA|5|This set is so adorable and handy.  Has everything you need on hand for keeping baby and yourself clean/dry during feedings.  I even use the burp cloths while breastfeeding, they are just the right size to always have one nearby.
B002WB2GL6|5|I read many reviews on this stroller before making the decision to purchase it. One of my concerns about the product, was the constant mention of squeaky wheels in the reviews. I went ahead and purchased it anyways because I love the look, style, and I found it on another site for much cheaper. I wanted to try it out keeping in mind that I may need to return it (I kept the box). I am so happy with this stroller! I have three other strollers and this one is by far my favorite. I love the modern and upscale look it has and the fact that it can be forward or rear facing. It's an added bonus that the adapter comes with it for the first several months that your baby is still in an infant seat. It's easy to access the basket (which is one of the flaws with my others when the seats are reclined) and the basket is pretty big as well. Unfortunately, after a while of use, the wheels did begin to squeak...but my husband is very handy and said that he could fix it no problem. I even told him about some of the reviews that said they used WD40 and that the wheels still squeaked. However, when we got home, he took the wheels off and rubbed some grease on the inside and then attached the wheels back on. So far we haven't had anymore squeaky wheels and it works just fine. I recommend this stroller if you want a classy looking stroller for less than half the price!
B004H7RT3S|2|Light weight crib. It is not easy to set up.<br />- It takes too much time.<br />- There are too many pieces that needs to fit together.<br />- Instructions aren't clear.<br />- I had to assemble, disassemble a few times to get it done properly.<br /><br /> I returned it today. I am puchasing baby bjorn light weight travel crib2 instead.
B000YDKKNK|5|I got this for my brother and sister in law who baby is due in Jan and they bothed loved it. It does a lot of fun and learning activities.It is even cooler in person than it looks online<br /><br />Shaggy
B0040JGGDM|4|I installed these relatively easy in my 2013 Toyota Sienna.  They cover the seat back fairly well but came out of box pretty wrinkled.  Perhaps this will fix itself over time?  Also, due to angle of front row seats they don't lie completely flat as picture shows.  However, I don't think this will inhibit the seat protection.  Can't comment on durability since I just installed them, but so far they're doing a good job.  Price is very fair.
B000056C86|5|This stuff mailed to China directly.my baby play well inside, and we dont worry about his safety there. But he wont stay there long time, and we need to release him out of that bed once a while.<br />It is convenient
B007Q4EGO4|5|Very suitable for Chimi Fen use pacifiers, baby six months later eat some food supplement, this hole is large enough, will not hinder fluid smoked.
B00B507C0U|5|I spent a lot of time researching car seats for our third child. After looking into numerous carseats, we decided to go for a seat that had met or surpassed the European standards. I work for a car insurance company in the claims department and I hate seeing accidents where a better seat could have saved a child's life or prevented serious injury.<br /><br />I felt that the Recaro seat would be the best in terms of safety because they began as a racecar seat manufacturer. They must know how to keep drivers safe in extreme conditions. Since this is our last child, I was less concerned with the cost of the seat. And honestly, when it comes down to it, I felt that I would never forgive myself if I bought a cheaper seat and something were to happen to my daughter. I saved for a couple of months before she was 12 months old to be able to afford it (giving up Starbucks for a few months is nothing compared to the safety of my kids).<br /><br />She was always fussy in the car and never settled down when we were on the road. After we got this seat, she seemed so much more comfortable. She falls asleep quickly (which can be both a positive and negative thing, depending on the day) and she can see out the window.<br /><br />It is a very large seat and it took both my husband and myself to install it in our car. We have a Honda Odyssey and this seat might be a tight squeeze in a sedan. I love the LATCH hooks - they can unhook like a regular seatbelt latch system which makes moving it from one car to another MUCH easier. I wouldn't say that it was particularly difficult to install; honestly, no carseat is a picnic to get properly installed.<br /><br />I like the color, even though I have never been a big fan of pink. It's girly without being &#34;prissy&#34; (no frills, lacey things, cutsey animals, etc).<br /><br />I would buy this seat again. We are actually considering getting a second one for our other vehicle.
B006ZVV0P2|5|I choose these kick mats based on other reviews.  They were easy to put on...and really do the job!  I drive around with two little grandsons in the backseat.  I just bought a new car and wanted to keep it nice.  These do just that!
B00BUO4664|5|We had a Colicy baby who didn't like to sleep in a bassinet on his back. Our doctor suggested getting one of these. Once we got this it helped him sleep for longer periods of time. it is great because it conforms perfectly to our little guy and he isn't right on his back anymore and sleeps soundly. We can rock him or let the vibration option due it. Our only complaint is the two buttons to fold the unit rattle when it is vibrating, so my wife put tape on it to stop the rattling.
B002FQKB2Y|4|i bought the hammock package that came with a toy chain as well; the hammocks are great! Its a great solution for allergy sufferers because they keep the toys in the room, but up and away from the kids and its easy to take them down to play or to wash them. Its helped my son (with bad dust mite allergies) keep his stuffed animals, instead of having to take them out to the garage. He is very happy, and I love the look of the room!
B00AX37T76|3|The soaker is a funny shape and makes the diaper bulky, it would be much better with a natural fiber soaker.
B004VL2VRO|5|We started sleep training tonight (Mindell method) and I don't think we would have made it without this monitor. We were able to see and hear our four month old son clearly. He successfully fell asleep on his own after 45 minutes. Knowing he was OK and being able to watch him between checks kept us going. The ability to pan from the parent unit is very nice. We rarely used it before sleep training, but it will now be a constant night time companion. As others have mentioned, resolution is good enough to see our baby breathing and the camera does not flash intermittently like other video monitors do. I highly recommend this unit and it is well worth the price.
B005K0IF70|4|No problems at all
B0051GH2ZO|5|He was swimming in the car seat without this. Now he fits nicely and is clearly more comfortable. It was just the thing.
B0055NCGIG|5|Was a gift for my niece for a baby shower, matched the set, she was pleased
B002BSGWU6|5|These are about average in size for blankets. For the price and quality these blankets are worth every penny. There's outfits that these blankets match great with as well. I'm excited to use these. Coming right out the package these were already very soft. Like someone pointed out in an earlier review, the more blankets the better.
B000CSBP86|4|THIS BABY CARRIER WAS BOUGHT OFF FROM A BABY REGISTRY....THEY WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUAILTY AND USE IT FREQUENTLY
B0035ER8GC|5|This is just about the most basic crib you could buy.<br /><br />It was mindlessly simple to put together, very well planned out by the designer for the end user to get the job done quickly.<br /><br />We are still waiting on the mattress for it (any day now) and I will update this review once our little great nephew is sleeping in this crib.<br /><br />On another related note, they make a mattress for the Pack and Play (Graco), and I think that would make an excellent &#34;crib&#34; with the mattress in it. My great nephew is nine months old, just started crawling all around the house, and would not want to hang out in a Pack and Play for very long other than sleep - which is where he has been sleeping while we wait to get this put together.<br /><br />So... my 2 cents worth, I really think that a Pack and Play with the mattress in it would make a perfectly fine &#34;crib&#34; with a zero tip over risk.
B008Y2DFLM|3|It's an Ok pillow, if offers the correct support but when its hot, baby sweats a lot, need to remove it, even with a pillow case, my baby sweats to much while using this pillow
B007PQQG2I|5|It did come with a chunk out of it but I am working with them now to get it resolved.
B007700SEO|5|My 4 month old grandson has recently discovered musical sounds connected with actions, re. his play mat has piano sounds when he kicks.  He loves us to hold this toy where he can see himself and to play the sounds for him.  I think early musical sounds are the key to later interest in music.
B000IDSLOG|1|My daughter pushed one of the leg into her throat when chewing, and since the feet are bigger then the legs them selves it got stuck and she could not breath! If I wouldn't have been in the room I don't want to imagine what would have happen. It was HORRIBLE to look into my baby's scared eyes before I managed to pull it out. She her self would not have managed, since it was stuck hard and as a baby of 5 month she did not have the coordination, nor the presence, to grab it the right way. It seemed more that she was pushing it deeper in her desperation. I took a scissors and cut the thing into pieces and threw it away directly
B001C51TIE|5|I ordered this product as a replacement for my other piddle pad;  I had the smaller one that Kiddopotamus makes and prefer this new one to the old one. It is a better quality fabric and is larger so it fits the car seat better preventing any accident overflow.
B00000IZQI|4|My son plays with these cars to some extent everyday but has never really gotten the concept. He has never stacked them or nested them, even after countless attempts at showing him how they work. He does drive them around and his new thing is bringing the car to mommy so mommy can run it all over his back. It's a daily routine that he looks forward to. Maybe someday he will get the idea on what they are actually for.
B0002EO596|5|This glider is so great!  It was so easy to put together and is so convenient in my baby's room for those late night and middle of the night feedings.  I didn't think I really \\"needed\\" a glider when I first registered, but it is one of my favorite things I received.  Together with the ottoman, I would definitely recommend these to any new mom!
B000YZCFWW|1|VERY flimsy. Tray wouldn't lock in.
B001FGL9X0|5|My son loves it, and it's so much easier to find than a pacifier alone if he's in his car seat! I think it's over-priced, but it sees tons of use, so I can justify it. =)
B004G81SUS|5|I didn't understand how messy eating would get when I purchased this and am so glad I picked the right one. The price is great, the size isn't horrible (stable enough but not a monster) and it actually looks decent in our 1920's prairie style house (circles pattern).  But that's all just the \\"extras\\". I love it mostly because when my daughter was six months old and got a stomach bug and kept puking every time we fed her, it was actually no big deal to clean. Really. The straps are non-porous, so anytime life gets messy i throw the soft cover in the wash and wipe everything else with a damp cloth, which takes about 60 seconds. So glad i didn't buy one of those fancy, expensive and uncomfortable-looking wood high chairs after having had this.
B0012YMWO0|5|My 7 month old son loves crawling on it and playing with his toys on it.
B00SOMAYIY|5|I ordered this because, as a busy mom and caretaker, sometimes our strollers outlive the handle covers. My stroller is still in great condition but those foam grips are in much need of repair. When I was *offered to try these for my unbiased review* I jumped at the chance, after all why buy a new stroller when I can just attach new handle covers. Not only are they simple to install but they are comfortable and handle great. They could be used for many strollers as the covers are well adjustable to fit. They are sporty and eye catching and the company offers such a huge variety.
B002CGRT1S|5|We have two very energetic dogs so we needed a gate to keep them from certain places. I wanted a gate that swung open but didn't have a bar running down on the floor. This was perfect. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old so I also wanted a gate that was easy enough for them to open. I was able to teach both of them very quickly.<br /><br />We also have another baby on the way and will definitely buy another one for the top of the stairs when he/she comes in January.
B000TVXJ8K|3|It is warm and a good product.  However, because it fits a larger baby, they have difficulty rolling or moving in the crib during the night in the sleeper.  It makes me nervous to leave the baby wearing it at night because he may roll on his stomach and get stuck due to limited movement of his legs in the sack.
B001HTJS60|5|Best baby chair. My 2 year old still loves to sit in it. I love that I can move it easily from room to room.
B0018E120Y|5|Big bottle fast ship
B002WB2G9I|5|Love this stroller.  Wanted a slight upgrade from the standard umbrella stroller & this one fit the bill.  parent console is very handy and the underneath basket works well for small bags.  Doesn't hardly recline at all, but if she is tired enough my daughter will fall asleep in it.  Also the sunshade isn't much help.....but hats work too.  Overall we love this stroller and it fits out needs & wants for a lightweight & compact stroller.  Would highly recommend to frinds.
B00OGJFPTC|5|Perfect fit for my brother and his new baby.
B00AHVR5U0|2|We purchased this system as it was one of the few that allowed us to move the baby when sleeping and that is does. HOWEVER, while wiping the top of the mattress I noticed that I could feel two metal bars that support the bottom of the bassinet. With little weight or pressure they were easy to feel through the top of the mattress where the baby's head and feet would be. To make the matter worse there are also several bolts on those metal bars that support the pegs the bassinet sits on when placed on the floor. They protrude even further up toward the mattress top and can easily be felt through the thin mattress.<br /><br />I cant imagine how this could not cause an indentation, injury or at the least extreme discomfort. Obviously the situation gets worse with weight and size.<br />I am super disappointed and will be notifying the manufacturer.
B00MNV8AMY|4|Great idea, apparently good product, but it exactly is what the description says: REALLY little pouch... Will have to order the bigger size and use these for really little portions. The filling process was very messy... Even with a teaspoon... So if you get these I would suggest to get their funnel as well ...
B002UD65XQ|5|Have had for almost 2 years and no complaints
B0000488VE|3|I did receive the tot lock but it wasn't the same as the picture,it was a key looking thing.Im not using the magnet for opening cabinets, im using it find screws in studs but the lok they send me not strong enough. I did have the original one that was strong but I lost it hence the replacement..but its ok
B00ECHYTBI|5|After researching monitors using a baby product book and speaking with current moms, I decided to register for the infant optics monitor on Amazon without seeing it and based on reviews. It was not a mistake and we have not been disappointed with our decision.<br /><br />We live in a small row home with the nursery and master close by but the monitor gives us the sense of security we need to get our little one in the crib in stead of right next to our bed. I'm able to quickly control the volume, speak through the monitor, see the temperature in the room, and zoom and change camera angles (not all features but the ones we use most frequently).  Although I typically leave the video monitor plugged in bed side, the battery does last unplugged for an extended amount of time.<br /><br />After hearing poor reviews for Motorola products we were happy to have made this purchase with a specialized product and the cost on Amazon is ideal!!!
B005JN6304|4|Gate was bent looked like it had been returned
B00O3L8Q2G|1|My least favorite of all the diapers I have tried. After a few washes, the inside fabric feels pretty rough and holds stains way more than my other cloth diapers.<br />I won't be buying another.
B0025MYX2M|5|No use, looks good
B0035RQTTQ|4|Overall, this product is great. I got this from family when my son came earlier than we expected and hadn't gotten a car seat yet. The car seat is awesome. Never had problems with it and it held up through multiple airline trips (he flew in cabin with it). Fit in all the vehicles we've brought him in.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this was the stroller breaks. For some reason they are randomly hard to press down. A few times of that and the pin inside that kept the wheel on the stroller kept falling off causing the wheel to fall off. Had to walk home half carrying the stroller..frustrating. I contacted the company and they were quick to send me replacement wheel hardware. Honestly I haven't changed them out because prior to the arrival of the hardware I rigged a twisty tie to hold the pin in place and i've been using it like that for over a year. Though I still occasionally have problem's where the foot break just won't press down to lock. Other than that my son loves this stroller.
B00A2HUDOY|3|This seat is rated for a child up to 40 pounds in rear-facing mode, but having my (30 pound toddler) child rear-facing in this seat feels very cramped.  The straps don't seem long enough to comfortably get him out after releasing them. The flexible side protection wings on the headrest are always flipping in the way when I put him in the seat.  It's uncomfortable for us both.<br /><br />I do like how the lowest buckle doesn't get caught under his bum, and the click-safe feature is a good idea (that seems to need the kinks worked out).
B00P0A6OM8|5|I highly recommend this product! They work excellent by blocking the sun's harmful rays.
B000UVHPKM|1|We ordered a 3T/4T when opened it was probably size 24 months.  Our grandson cried because he could not be a pumpkin for Halloween.  TOTALLY DISSATISFIED.
B00186ZQUO|5|awesome. def worth the money.
B00073HJG8|5|Easy to install.  Big size. Great quality.  Fits all of my kids stuffed animals...which is a lot.  It's nice to have them up off of the floor.
B005VIFUEC|5|Awesome baby sleeper! We used this as his halloween costume! And we get to use as a sleeper too! Looks just like picture! Soo cute!
B002D3XFCW|5|This was so adorable, the only problem was that it was bigger than any normal size 3-6 months.  It was extra long and big in size
B001JHSTS8|4|I happened upon Nipplette while serching for information on women's health.  I had inverted nipples my whole life, until one recently popped out after training for a half marathon, leaving me looking like a padiddle. I read reviews available on multiple websites and decided to take the plunge.  I've been using it for about 2 months and my nipple is consistently out.  The process required trial and error, despite all of the wonderful advice in the reviews. I eventually found that using a lubricant like KY jelly and taping with latex-free first-aid tape was the best combination.  I experienced some discomfort with irritation and redness for a few days - my nipple was perfectly content to be inverted and did not seem to like being in the world - but this passed. I've graduated to wearing Nipplette once a week, and this appears adequate.  I don't have sufficient time in the post-verting stage to determine if this is a permanent fix, but I am very pleased with the results so far.
B0000TYHD2|5|I bought this pump to keep at work so I wouldn't have to tote my Avent Isis Duo every day.  I was a little leery of this brand, but I'm so glad I bought it!  Being able to keep it in the bag while pumping is a big bonus.  Setup is so quick, and so is cleaning.  The massaging part of the pump is much more effective in getting more milk from me in a much shorter amount of time than my Avent.  This is cheaper and much more handy than my Avent!  I would recommend this to everyone!
B007NG5UF4|4|we like it, it's taken some adjustment, but it's growing on me.  reason being, it's voice activated.  it makes zero sound until a sound is made.  (you set the sensitivity)  we were used to hearing the white noise machine on the old one, but we set the sensitivity on this one and it doesn't put that sound through, we don't hear anything until he coughs or starts making noise.  which is actually kinda nice, just a little weird at first.  the first .5 seconds of sound isn't heard though.  drove me crazy one night, every 30 seconds or so it'd start buzzing and transmitting sound, but I never heard anything.  I finally went up to his room and his smoke alarm battery dying was chirping.  so I wasn't hearing the chirp, just the low buzz of it transmitting sound after the buzz (it transmits sound/static for about 5 seconds after it detects sound).<br /><br />it's got talkback on it which is why we got it.  our son loves it!  he wakes up in the morning and walks over to it and yells for me, so I can push the button on our end and talk back to him.  we thought it'd be good for those nights he wakes up and we could just console him back to sleep and not have to go up there.<br /><br />the battery's great - I guess since it doesn't constantly transmit sound it doesn't take much.  but we only charge it every 3-4 days, leaving it on all night every night and during a 1-2 hour nap in the day.
B00208NUOI|5|We have had these for our twins for over a year now and not a single problem.  We got them right away as soon as I realized we had a beaver/billy goat on our hands.  She had only given the rails a tentative nibble or two.  One of our girls just can't keep herself from chewing on anything remotely chewable.  Once we put these on, she no longer even tried.  They have also saved us some bruised heads as they offer additional padding.  They washed well originally but we haven't had to wash them since then.  Have had no problems with either of my girls trying to take them off and the ties worked perfectly on our crib.  Only downside is that it was expensive for us to fully equip both cribs with all 3 pieces needed.
B009JV34RC|4|This pillow is ok. My son has slept on(mostly off of) it for a week now, and it's not flat yet. It's so small that his head is constantly off the pillow. If they made it a bit bigger would give it 5 stars.
B003S5EA4Q|5|These are the cutest receiving blankets ever! I love the original Strawberry Shortcake so was so excited to find these brand new! I love them!
B009F5CJO6|4|I would actually give it 5 stars if it weren't for the price, because c'mon, these are more expensive than my Wusthof kitchen shears, and I can cut through bone with that.<br /><br />What I do love:<br />It's ceramic - I use this to cut food for my 10-month old, so I love that it's ceramic and sharp, doesn't rust and cuts well, both very important to me when it comes to prepping food for my baby. Also, the ceramic material doesn't seem to scratch the plastic kids bowls as a pair of metal shears would.<br /><br />It's lightweight and comes with a cover - great for taking with you to restaurants in the diaper bag, while I wish I could afford two pairs and just leave one in the kitchen and one in my diaper bag, it's easy enough to clean and throw in my bag before I go out.<br /><br />Size and weight - again, perfect for taking with you everywhere. It's small and light, perfect for cutting baby food.
B000F1QPIA|5|Love the cotton swaddle. Don't confuse it with the muslin swaddles which I think are too loose but these are amazing.
B00E1CI2TO|5|Great
B00067ELGG|4|My baby loves this, we bought a few days ago and she watches it for the full 15 minutes and more.  She is 7 weeks old and is mesmerized.  I didn't realize it but the dolls have counterweight balls that help it rotate under it's cone while it rotates around the tilted axis.  Plus the sliding shapes on top give more for her to watch.  It makes even more interesting to watch. It does not appear to have a silent feature as said in reviews, but we love the music and can't complain.    update Feb. 12, 2011  I knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.  We still love it but it is not impressive to me as the v-tech dream & play mobile which is hard to find in the USA from what I can tell.  The features that the v-tech has which tiny love does not is very good volume control which can be adjusted from loud to very faint or no sound.  The other feature I'd love to see is motion control feature that plays soft music and has a soft light that comes on.
B00R7Q3GOC|5|my niece loved it
B004DC9TAI|4|love how easy it is to push. Certainly too bulky to be used as an every day ride. My only complaint is that I wish the back sat up just a but more straight. You can adjust it but he still lays back.
B001TUZNFC|5|I really did a lot of research before buying this carseat. My 3 1/2 year old son is on the verge of outgrowing his Alpha Omega 3-in-1 carseat (41\\" and 38lbs),I want to keep him in a 5pt. harness for as long as possible. I considered the Britax Frontier, but I couldn't be happier with the Nautilus. It was so easy to assmeble and install. My son LOVES it. He loves the cup holder and the little cubbies on the insides of the armrests. The headwings are quite impressive, which is very important to me. The fabric is very nice and the padding is great. He is very comfortable in this seat and we absolutely love it. It's also nice to have it convert to a booster later on for up to 100lbs with either the highback or backless option. I would recommend this carseat to anyone whose child is too large to be rear-facing!
B00O5F2G8K|4|Great bed rail but it's still too short for my double sided pillow top bed. I'm having to send it back.:( it only gave my bed like 2 inches of support which isn't enough support for my 3 year old.
B003YDGNYW|5|Thanks *:)
B00JWIMHM0|5|very happy with my purchase, is what I expected, even not use it, since it has not even born my baby, but ña sight and touch is comfortable and good material.
B003ZUXQXU|4|Easy to use and keeps baby warm in a safe fashion! Only issue is that he likes to kick off the bottom. Nice quality fabric used.
B00AHPZZGC|5|Very good. Comfy. Baby falls asleep in it easily. Pretty simple to install. A little heavy but sturdy so thats good.
B0013K0NRG|2|These nipples are terrible. I bought 2 packs of slow nipples and they are anything but slow. When the bottle is turned upside down, milk pours out. I am very dissapointed in them. They get a second star only due to fast shipping.
B00119MR2S|5|These are so helpful! I love that they are easy to put in my purse and then whip out when we are out. I hate thinking about all the germs that might be on the table and I feel badly for service staff who have to clean up baby messes, so these are wonderful! I can put baby's food right on it and not worry. My daughter is entertained a bit with the colors and characters on these as well, which helps pass the time. When it's time to go, I just lift the mat up and we're done. Makes it a lot easier to pick up any stray food, so wait staff don't have to deal with it.
B00NFY534Q|5|Great quality! Would buy again.
B00834D5SO|5|We love this seat. It's huge and safe, but also easy to install and feels very secure with either the LATCH or just the belt.  Not a ton of leg room while back facing, which expedited our decision to turn them. Also the strap to tighten up the harness is less than top-of-the-line in that it doesn't have a cam lock or other aid, so you have to really really tug to get it to tighten and often it's loose if you just tried once or twice.<br /><br />They collect a lot of food and whatnot but the covers come off and wash easily.  The foam also comes out easily too as our irate toddler showed us and this is a problem since it eliminates the protection. We wish it was integrated a bit more or fused like a bicycle helmet so it didn't just break off in chunks.
B00FWRR8W4|4|Perfect teething ball. My sons could hold on to it easily. They loved it. I actually bought these for friend's babies who also loved it.
B0083TTLG4|5|More than fine....
B001RTLNWC|5|My boyfriend got me this bunny for Christmas - it's the best thing ever for muscle cramps, sore spots, etc. It's heavy enough to stay where you put it, but not too heavy. It gets nice and toasty to soothe sore, stiff muscles and cramps, and is cute too.<br />It does have a strong several-herbs-put-together odor when you first microwave it - but that fades after about the dozenth time you microwave it.<br /><br />I put mine in for 40-45 seconds on each side (tail and tummy).
B004J35KE0|5|This bag is a good gift for baby shower. Convenience for mon. It's not only diaper bag but also daily bag.
B000K1AFJK|1|We have tried it several times with my daughter, she cried every time we tried to use it.  I think it's possibly hurting her under the arms, she would only walk when someone was holding her arms. This product ended up being useless for us.
B002NKN9RG|4|Cute...I like it! I receive it green, even if i have a baby girl, i would prefer to choose the color, it is random. But the product is nice!
B000IDJF5U|4|The colors were a little different than what I thought they would be around the edge, but it is still a very cute blanket.  Nice and soft.
B000JHM30O|5|SOLID, works well, should last for ever. I'm happy. Little Will [grand son] is happy to.
B003U6HCGQ|5|Our son has hated his car seat since about 10-12 weeks of age.  We got this and it helped so much with short trips.  Longer trips it worked for a while and then he still wanted out of the seat, but we would recommend it to everyone whose little one hates the car seat.  We had to stop using it because he could reach it.  It also worked on the pack and play edge.
B00QBODQ0K|4|This is perfect! It's not too bulky where it's hanging loose. Fits just the right amount of items in the pocket
B00A0ID90A|4|good
B004WKBYQ8|3|I have had a really hard time finding the perfect grey crib sheet for the nursery and I was really excited when I came across this one.  As much as I want to write a good review for a product that costs only $15, I feel like this is a case of you get what you pay for.  The quality is okay - the sheet is thin and it doesn't fit the mattress as snug as I would like.  I will keep this as a back up, but I have purchased three other sheets as my primary ones.
B009OV4444|5|This is a super cute blanket.<br />i'm so happy ;) my little girl love a lot.<br />thank you so much.*
B000KJZOWU|2|&#34;You've got to have a pregnancy pillow&#34; all the online blogs and whatnot said.  I am currently 20 weeks pregnant with my first baby and found this pillow to simply be too thick for me.  I learned from this product that I can't have pillows between my knees without having hip pain (I need to put pillows between my calves instead).  I wish I would've saved the money and just used the pillows that I am currently using.  This pillow is now just sitting in my closet and I'm hoping to find another use for it...
B000765NA4|2|Horrible design! I should've listened to the other reviews. It will stay on my daughters Graco stroller as long as she doesn't touch it! The music hippo is cute and the toys catch her attention but bad design overall.
B00C6D2WOQ|4|i like this product
B002B4OVWG|2|Some friends had suggested I get a Wubbanub since, especially on car rides, my baby would spit out his pacifier and start crying.  No way to reach to the backseat and put it back in.    Unfortunately, the Wubbanub comes with a Soothie brand pacifier attached, and my baby simply does not take a Soothie.  So he makes a face and spits it out every time, and we're back to square one.  Now that he's 14 weeks and can grab things more easily, he seems to like to play with the Wubbanub, but in that case I could just have gotten a stuffed animal at the dollar store!  Cute idea, but unless there's a way to get one with an Avent pacifier (or Nuk or Mam or whatever else other babies like), this hasn't been the miracle it was for other parents.
B004CKHC4Q|2|The diaper bag is very convenient and useful but the top handle stitching came apart in less than 24 hours of light use.  Gave the bag 2 stars because of the inconvenience that was caused during our light use while traveling.  If the stitching is fixed then yes this product would be highly recommended.
B007XRDD16|5|Was shocked!  Price was low and didn't expect much.  Lights arrived promptly from China, worked and looked great.  Have above a counter and cooktop, lights are right brightness and easy to adjust.
B002A9JCVW|5|A really functional bottle drying rack, plus it looks cute in a whimsical kind of way! We have been using it extensively since the birth of our first baby, for drying bottles, nipples, pump parts, pacifiers, etc. It has a good amount of space for loading it up with multiple bottles, and the various levels make it easy to keep things separate enough and positioned in such a way that they dry thoroughly and quickly.<br /><br />For me, it helps that it looks like a cute little plant or flower thing sitting on the counter, instead of like a more plain, white industrial-type bottle rack. We have a Boon Lawn (http://www.amazon.com/Boon-Grass-Countertop-Drying-Green/dp/B0032G9E0G/) too, and on the counter top it looks like the two items coordinate together. Makes the kitchen counter look more like a little garden than just a baby dishes drying area. Also, very reasonably priced for a drying rack!<br /><br />Definitely happy with my purchase, and I wouldn't hesitate to give this as a baby shower gift to anyone who is expecting since it is very practical and necessary.
B002GQFOZW|3|Looked very nice on the window with the other valance that came with the set.  I wouldn't buy a set in a bag again though - I feel like it is a huge waste of money!
B002UD65XQ|5|Carter's waterproof crib mattress pad at a really good price.  The best price I found comparison shopping online and in store.
B00J7Y9CC2|5|Sturdy and easy to use! I'm not into big clunky kids accessories, so this is great! Easy to detach and take with us to restaurants. Also quite easy to clean.
B000056OWC|1|There are only 2 positions for this tub and doesn't fit for larger or older babies. <BR>This tub is great for any baby under 4 months ! !  its a perfect size supporting your baby and its easy to move. <br />But, once now that my little guy is 5 1/2 months its not easy to clean your baby in the sitting position, and he is too big --length wise ( his only in the 10 percentile for height and 20 percentile for weight -- so he's not a 'large' baby.) to be in the lieing down position.--- his feet get jammed up under the t-bar.  <BR>horrible product for babies older than 4 months or for larger babies.
B001LRNXV4|5|I didn't have high hopes for this lock as the one that we had put on our refrigerator before peeled off in a very short time.  This one works!  It sticks, resists the powerful pulling of our strongman 2-year old, and we're really happy with it.  Best of all, it's a one-handed affair to open the fridge and unlock it at the same time:  Grab the handle of the door and use your thumb to push the lever aside.  It seems fairly bomb proof and is easy to use.  Not unsightly either.  Highly recommended!
B0046HSSRK|5|My husband is a into computers and robots and such and he loved this. Makes it easier to plug everything in without having to reach the back of the computer.  Looks cute too :)
B001I82OE8|3|This gadget looks cute.  My biggest concern is that just counting to 10 alone isn't enough.  If I could tell expectant mothers anything, it would be to be consistent with when you are kick counting.  Look for changes.  It's a great way to get to know your baby.
B001ABZGU2|5|these links are so handy for alot of uses for baby. We use them on his car seat, his swing, and for him to chew on.
B000056HNX|1|I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying. <br />So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is \\"normal\\" or will be \\"outgrown.\\"  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!!
B00009IMCK|5|my dog loved it
B00IX6PEB8|3|It's nice..but made of Some Styrofoam material and it's too big for a 3 month old. It would be nice if the description said that it would work best if child can sit up
B000L9JNK8|4|My daughter loves this bunny and will not sleep without it.  It has held up well for over 2 years except the bunny is now more of a light grey color than white.  The pink satin is starting to get some picks but that is expected after she has dragged it everywhere for over 2 years.  Machine washable.
B00TR1P0IU|4|We received the toddler pillow quite quickly. The size is just right for a small toddler, and not too fluffy, or flat. The quality of the pillow is good and comes with a white pillow case that fits the small pillow nicely. Our two year old daughter was so excited to lay on it that she played in bed and covered up before I could even get her pjs on. She snuck into bed a few times justbwhile trying to finish our bedtime routine. Overall, happy with the product, delivery time, and quality.
B00IXVZI00|4|I purchased this cover at Babies R Us (where it is considerably cheaper) as a back up for our Space Saver High Chair (Pink Circles). I expected it to be the same as the cover the chair came with; it isn't. Here are the similarities/differences:<br /><br />*The seat back part of the cover is fine and the holes line up nicely.<br />*The right and left sides (by baby's legs) are about an inch shorter on the replacement pad creating space for food to fall into. This was disappointing to me.<br />*There is one hole for the pummel/crotch strap, on our original cover there was a separate hole for the crotch strap. Not a huge deal, just different.<br />*This cover attaches fine on the bottom, but pulls a bit, creating even more of a gap by the legs.<br /><br />All that said, I'm still glad I bought this and I'm REALLY glad Fisher Price makes replacement covers. It washes just as well as our original and the pattern is REALLY adorable and gender neutral if our next baby is a boy. I think the above mentioned differences might be necessary for older models of the chair; ours was purchased off our BRU registry just last year.<br /><br />I would purchase another replacement cover and would recommend this product.
B009IVKY7Q|4|Easy to use and great for traveling. Only thing I would change is to make it smaller.  No need for 3 squeezers.
B000LZDUJ2|1|Very low quality and it rips easily
B000HC0AM4|5|After purchasing a few other nursing covers/shawls, and not being impressed, L'oved Baby has more than made up for previous disappointments. These are absolutely beautiful. The pictures do not do them justice. I bought blue and pink (as I'm nursing both girl and boy), and love them. They are lightweight and breathable, fit well, allow me to see them underneath, and are really lovely fabrics. I highly recommend them! I can't recommend these enough! they are beautiful, functional, lightweight, baby can be seen underneath, etc. Lovely embroidery, and nice fabric. Love them!
B000KZE3CG|4|My son goes absolutely bonkers in this toy.  It keeps him occupied for a good long time.  Warning though:  There's a million parts to put together!
B00BI2VW6K|5|This product is a must! Helps both momma and baby sleep great! I drink a cup Every night
B000Q7HL6S|2|This toilet seat is a good idea for family use, the only disappointed thing is that the seat will slip away after awhile. It happened to my both bathroom. The locks is not made fitted to the general toilet. We have to fix it almost every week.
B00UV2YLMK|1|I just received this diaper bag last night. I haven't had any experiences with diaper bags, this is my very first diaper bag. But my husband and I have been looking for one since my baby was born last year.  First of all, this bag was very well-made! The quality is outstanding. The straps are heavy duty and can withstand the weight of our things in it. Second, with all the stuff I bring with me whenever we go out, I'm impressed that this bag still has room in it. This bag is very roomy. Third, I love that it has lots and lots of pockets both inside and out. I also love the pockets with zipper outside. I can just pop my phone inside those pockets! Last, I really appreciate the stroller straps because that solved my problem. I've been placing my old bag under the stroller and it was super hard to pull out.  Plus, the changing pad is a very nice surprise. It's not too thin and it fits my baby perfectly.  I definitely recommend this bag. Thanks Hip Cub Team!  UPDATE: After using this bag for a month, the main zipper and the zipper on the sides of the bag were broken. I couldn't zip it anymore. And the stitches on the outside pockets fell apart. I have stuff for just one baby and the things I usually bring and put in the bag are not that big or heavy. So I bought a new diaper bag from a different brand.
B00378KTAI|3|initially i loved these cups. i prefer straws to spouts because that's how adults drink, but we struggled to find a straw cup that was easy for our kid to hold but not a total pain in the butt to use. the munchkin straw cups are awful. they have no air vent, i guess to prevent leaks, but that means they are so hard to drink out of they are unusable. These have an air vent, so they are easy to drink out of, and yet they manage to be leak-proof anyway. my only complaint is that the girl colors are more pastel in real life than in the picture, which is a shame b/c the colors in the picture looked cool.    HOWEVER, we ended up discontinuing use of these because the plastic is soft enough that when you squeeze them, water comes out the straw. endless fun! since we couldn't find any straw cups that were any better we switched back to the soft spout kind. oh well.
B00APSYDFK|5|These are fantastic for use in my kindergarteners lunch
B00HT6E6GW|5|Love it
B0027ZARMW|5|I had a 9 pound newborn, these wraps say 6-10 pounds but in reality they work very well for little babies up to 12 pounds. I love these wraps Sri much, easy to clean and easy to use.
B0083973FK|5|We got these because our little one was regularly soaking through her diapers at night 3-4 nights a week. These do exactly what they're supposed to - we've been using them for about a month and haven't had to change the sheets yet. Glad we found them!
B00E6NU5H0|1|I tried to fit this on my babies head multiple times - not that it is big for her, but it does not fit properly and water leaks!!! The quality of the material also was not good.
B005DOS2EE|5|Great Buy!
B00GEF7DJG|4|I love my Ergobaby! I had a bjorn, but my son was out growing it and it was very uncomfortable to wear. This has nicely padded straps and he fits into it better. He can also spend more time in it, though he does get rather hot in it, but for this I would suggest an active Ergobaby because it's better suited for air circulation. I also love that he sits with his legs wrapped around me rather than dangling down because it is better for his hips, and a little more natural. I highly recommend getting this.
B004B762AK|5|This monitor is great. The size of the screen is good and the picture is quite clear in day and night. Would recommend this product. Definitely worth the money.
B0007D90SS|5|I bought this to go walking with when there might be a chance of rain! Well it works great!!! And I even put it on my double stroller so my son could still sit in the back seat and be nice and comfy and dry! It works great and easy to use!
B004RKV2C4|5|I am very happy with this stroller. It has everything I ask for in stroller, liteweight, sturdy, great quality and attractive. Highly recommended!!!
B00HX4SZW6|5|Great quality
B00KBA6OLS|5|Fabulous product great price
B001ODAHF0|5|We and our kid love the stroller, it's compact, fully reclinable and very easy to drive even with one hand. We abandoned our full size stroller for this one and do not regret even one minute. Shipping was free and super fast despite Easter long weekend. Well done Chicco! Well done Amazon!
B003YL3EIW|5|My 9 month old twins really get a kick out of being able to sit in the tub and splash in the water while I bathe them!  This is a must have in my opinion..
B005MPZXIM|5|I use this to bathe my toddler. Mini showers are so much faster than filling up the tub and keeping it fixed to the wall keeps my son from grabbing the shower head and getting the entire bathroom wet.<br /><br />A tip: it works best if the latch is pointing downward, in my opinion. The reason is that the way that the shower handle holder is attached to the suction cup latch means that if the latch is facing left and you try to turn the shower head to the right, it can undo the suction cup latch, so turning it 90 degrees from the rotational direction prevents that from occurring.
B0046S4N5A|4|We have an older, hand-me-down Prince Lionheart seat and I wasn't sure if this tray would work. It definitely does. My baby (6 months) loves to have the tray, so he can balance a book, or bang a toy against it. The tray is a little difficult to get in the chair, but once you get it going, it's not bad and really easy to remove.
B005UBCJBC|5|We bought this for my 10-month old when he outgrew his infant car seat.  He's 3 now and still using the seat.  It has held up through quite a bit of rough and tumble with my son.  Fabric is still in fantastic condition.
B00D9EJM6W|5|This product has been a lifesaver! My son was at a point where he was clearly unhappy swaddled, but every time we tried to wean him out of it he would (1) pull his pacifier and throw it every 3 minutes all night and (2) scratch his head and face (eczema :/). This product solved both those problems! Absolutely genius! He learned to find the extra pacifiers after me helping him practice for a few minutes. My husband and I were giddy watching him get his own pacifier on the baby monitor! He can get his hands to his face, but never really gets a really aggressive scratch going, and it does out quickly. He is sleeping better than he has in a long time. Can't say enough about how happy I am. Just ordered a second one for when this one needs to go in the wash!
B000R7L80C|5|We did baby led weaning (baby finger feeds self instead of being spoon fed purees) with both of our children, so this item has been an absolute essential.<br />Every time we go out to dinner we use one of these. They stick incredibly well to the table... just enough that the baby can't peel it off, but not so much that it's difficult for the us, the parents to get it back off the table.<br /><br />Aside from keeping baby's food off of public tables, these are my favorite baby item because they save me from having to do one of my least favorite things. Instead of using the side of my hand to wipe all the stray food off the table, I just roll the place mat up. That gets rid of the nasty food hand thing that happens.<br /><br />This is one of the very few baby \\"novelties\\" I actually repurchased for my second child. I would gift it to any new parent.
B000V8AKXS|3|These are great keys with some wonderful sound effects... i love the size (a bit bigger than some teething toys but not too big to shove in a diaper bag...    downfall: non-replaceable batteries... and the motion activation can set off easily (like when you walk on the floor at night--the pressure of footsteps make them go off).
B005DOS2EE|4|We are using at the bottom of steps to the deck as a dog gate.  Works great!  Not designed for outdoors but has held up for 3 months so far.
B0035RQF54|3|Three stars mostly because the dimensions make it not workable for us, even tho the locking part of it works fine. I hope they can come up with some adjustments that can resolve the issues I had.<br />Pros:<br />- This lock seems really sturdy compared to the door monkey hook lock. It probably would have been more durable for where we were interested in using it.<br />- I liked the idea of being able to &#34;deactivate&#34; the lock.<br />- Not having a slender hook makes me worry less about the risk of poking your eye out.<br />Cons:<br />- This lock is Huge. Leaving it sticking out in an open door entry will cover 1/3 of the  pathway's width. If you're carrying a laundry basket, it'll get in your way unless you flip it closed to the deactivated position first.<br />- Unless you have a 1/8&#34; or so gap between your door and the frame when it's closed, you won't be able to close your door when it's deactivated. It will bump into your door frame with the metal edge (there's no soft bumper) and could damage the frame.<br /><br />So in other words- it would get in our way when not deactivated, but I couldn't really use it in the deactivated position because of concerns that it could damage our door frame if the kids tried to close the door. I decided overnight to take it off and return it with barely any use.
B00N0OKGBG|1|Good concept but could not get software and connections working. Support took a while to get back to me-- ended up returning it before they told me the website was temporarily down. Was not easy to get started as advertised.
B006V84HSG|1|I'm not sure if the one I got was just defective, or what, but I got this cup for my 20-month-old son, and while it didn't leak (from the spout), as promised ... it leaked on the inside! All of a sudden I realized that there was milk in between the patterned outside of the inner cup and the plastic outer cup. I have no idea how it got in there, and no amount of shaking or rinsing got it out. It was returned immediately, and I went for a similar Playtex cup instead, which just has the one cup with no inner/outer cup to mess with. I certainly don't want to be the person at the end of the line when my used cup makes it back to them at Munchkin ... all that trapped milk just sitting there, ew.
B006ZVV0NO|1|Is not effective, hardly shades the sun. Not a great product.
B00IWCDO6A|2|Looks like a great product, feels great, but doesn't work in keeping little one warm.  her room is not cold (bet 68 - 70 degrees) but when she wears this to sleep at night, with the recommended underlayers, she wakes up to a pair of frozen hands, and her cheeks are very cold to touch.  I returned it and got a BadyDeeDee instead.  I put the same # of underlayers and she wakes up toasty warm.
B00BFQ5BM0|5|We've used this in both of our cars to protect the leather seats from the car seats.<br /><br />This is working well for more than a year (one with a Recaro seat on it and the other with a heavy Diono seat on it).  The organizer on the bottom flap is great as well for misc. items like sunglasses, napkins, etc.<br /><br />If you have a car with leather seats (or even cloth seats), I'd recommend protecting the seats with these and you get a small organizer as a bonus!
B009S4NN62|3|Good fabric but the workmanship is clearly cheap. One of the bibs had a full side that had missed stitches. Amazon refunded the cost of the bib, but Be aware that they may not be made as well as you might expect.
B000096NQU|5|My daughter was 6 weeks premature, and could not nurse for more than a few seconds and we had to feed her with a dropper.  I wanted to give her breast milk for her health, and I have pumped ever since.  This pump has the same motor as the hospital grade Symphony pump.  My lactation counseler suggested this pump for home use. I couldn't be happier.  Its fast and easy to use.  I get out so much milk I have over 150 frozen bags in less than 8 weeks.  It attaches to regular bottles so you can pump right into them.  Also my husband can carry it around in the bag and it just looks like more luggage.  I have the car adaptor, which allows me to go on long trips.  It holds everything I need to pump and store the milk.  I think its worth the money, even if you don't use it very often like I do.  Its quick, quiet and light.  My husband even sleeps in the same room while I pump.  And if cleaning the parts gets tedious, just buy the disposable microwavable bags for steralization.  I bought mine used, and just steralized the parts really well to get one cheaper.
B00J40BG46|3|ok - wish it didn't float, it would be perfect to help sit her up in the tub!
B005AYC45A|5|Im using it with my glass Dr brown bottles for almost 5 months now. I clean it up every other week with a damp cloth and it has never failed to work up until now.<br /><br />This was worth every penny. It is really important to sterilize bottles/nipples/bottle parts. I even pop in the pacifiers, spoons etc on the top shelf.
B000MRGML2|5|I originally purchased these bottles purely because they are BPA free, but they have so much more to offer.  I had been using Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles in the past and I was a bit skeptical when I decided to switch to a BPA free bottle; was I surprised!  I have not had any problems with leaks and the anti-colic system is working great for my three month old who has had HORRIBLE colic in the past.  They are also easy to hold and it doesn't take but a second to assemble (even when I have to make a bottle one handed!) I highly recommend these to anyone.
B0033484L2|5|I love this! In Saudi Arabia we use a square piece of Cotten folded into a rectangle and swaddle the baby and then wrap him up with a 2 inch wide 1 meter long piece of cotton belt .. We wrape him from shoulder tight to toe so the baby will not get frightend when he hears loud noises or wakes up from a belly ache. The plus in this product is that it is stretchable so it is not as tight as the traditional one we use plus less effort! I can make it securely wrapped by the Velcro.<br /><br />I don't know if this is relevant, but I have 3 kids, 2 of them who were swaddled the traditional way the first 2-3 months one of the, was a preemie just like my 3rd son. Both turned,crawled and walked on time. My youngest was,a very late bloomer! He just started to walk and he is 19 months old.<br /><br />The saying is that when we swaddle them tight our way they gain bone strength and tightness.
B002TRJFMQ|5|I bought this product for my neice, from what I've heard she loves it. I hesitant that it looked like some of the pieces were small...but, it's just in the picture.
B00FXR5S20|5|just what i needed!
B007I79JZA|5|Drys super well and the design is cute.
B006YPTZOM|4|Daughter likes it. She's thrown it a few times on hard floor, has not broke yet :). No leaks.She liked that is wobbly not a flat bottom, but I wish it was a bit more flat falls off easier. Very modern looking and the straw goes in and out easy.
B0009RG8X2|5|This is a must for any parent that lives in a cold climate, we use this item on a daily basis and I could not imagine having to struggle with my newborn trying to get her into a snowsuit. I have had many comments on how cute the bundle me is and have found that is washes up very nicely, and provides the utmost in convienence.
B003KTLYP8|2|The more I use this shield, the more disappointed I am.  I originally reviewed this item after one brief test application, during which I experienced no issues.  Having used a weather shield for a single BOB stroller for two years, I wrongly assumed the design quality would be similar.  However, during practical usage, I have found this to be poorly designed and of lesser quality than the older single model I own.<br /><br />My main issues:<br /><br />1.  The attachment to the handlebars is not secure.  This model uses two short velcro straps that secure around the handle itself.  The velcro strips are only 1\\" square, which doesn't lead to a secure connection.  These have come undone numerous times while running.  The older single model has long, adjustable looping tension cord that not only didn't come loose, but it was adjustable as well.<br /><br />2.  The velcro is connected to the end of the flap that hangs over the back of the stroller (parallel to the handle).  When you connect the velcro and fully install the shield, this flap is pulled into the gap between the back of the seat and the sun shades.  So, there is an opening for rain and wind to enter just above your kids heads.  If the rain is heavy, the water collecting on the top of the shade can drip directly into the stroller.<br /><br />3.  The cover is cut to fit on the duallie with the sun shades half down.  Unfortunately, because each part of the sun shade is a different size, the windowed half must be folded up.  This isn't ideal because, in this position, the excess shade is bunched around the heads of your passengers.  It would be better if it were cut to fit with the windowed segment extended.<br /><br />4.  Though not a difference between my singleThe rain shield should have a clear window that matches up to the window on the sun shade so that you can maintain visual contact while pushing the stroller.  In the case of the duallie, you can't install it with the windows in the proper position anyway, but it is a notable exclusion.<br /><br />I cannot say if these issues are simply differences between the single and duallie models or if design changes were made since the '09 models, but either way this current duallie cover leaves a lot to be desired.
B00LBDVVKS|3|The closet Dividers are sturdy and cute, but I wish the were bigger.  Shipping time was fast. They are only about 3 inches tall.  I think the seller just prints out the stickers on their computer and puts them on the plastic divider.  They work though and seem like they will last.  I honestly would look for another option it I had to buy a second time.
B002W5RT8W|5|I bought this as a baby shower gift and it is perfect for that!  The baby needs to be sitting up but this can be used anywhere-travel to grandparents, at a picnic, the sitter's, in a restaurant, and even in the house.  It is very sturdy and easy to fold and transport.  It has its own tray and is so easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this item!
B004044LD4|5|I got this mattress for my son a month ago and he sleeps well on it, it is comfy and waterproof ( a good combo , right!) Do not hesitate to get this mattress instead of the most expensive one, the quality for me is even better than the expensive ones.
B00HHDJ1N0|5|These work well and our little one is unable to pull the bib off of himself.
B000067EH7|5|My son loves this! I can't tell you what a difference it has made for bath time. I suggest just tossing the sling that it comes with, but otherwise, it is great!
B00BP6OVO4|4|I bought this as a rinse cup for my daughter while brushing her teeth. I wanted an incentive to convince her to not eat the toothpaste. She loves her cup and practices all the time...multiple times while brushing. Overall, great little toddler sized cup.
B00FCSCJB8|5|This organizer is great, it fits everything without adding bulk and weight. I was surprised at how much it does hold and securely at that. I had a Maclaren organizer and it doesn't even compare to this!
B002BSHTS0|4|I really love the look of this mobile - it has cute colours and is unisex in case number two isn't wearing blue.  The toys are really cute too. My only complaint would be the music - it only has two settings - very quiet and very loud and the one of the tunes is a bit too full on to sleep to!
B00DPFM78K|5|My son loves this toy and its a good size. It's not big and its not small.
B00FDX5914|5|What a great sample pack! Ordered one of these (as well as a &#34;Real Nappies&#34; beginner pack) when just starting my cloth diaper stash. I think it's so good to try out all sorts of cloth diapering brands, types, and options to find out for yourself what works for YOU. I had doubts about this brand (Econobum) because of the cheap price and I honestly thought the cover was kind of thin and cheap (this was before my son was even born and before I'd ever used a cloth diaper). It has far exceeded my expectations and is one of my favorite covers!  I actually love how thin the cover is, since cloth diaper butts are so &#34;fluffy.&#34; And the prefolds are top-notch and great for tri-folding. Covers and prefolds are my favorite cloth diapering method!
B002SG7JS0|5|My daughter is 22 months old and absolutely LOVES this toilet seat!  She actually runs to the bathroom and yells POTTY!  I bought 2 of these seats.  One for upstairs and one for downstairs.  We have elongated TOTO toilets and they fit perfectly!  Would highly recommend this item.
B007ZMO0IE|5|Saved our cups! I love having extra parts in case I loose or destroy one (my garbage disposal seems to love to have them as a snack....)
B003ULP592|5|Great product. Easy to use. Very sturdy and gave me great piece of mind!! Highly recommend.
B00007DWBH|5|It is great to have a spare for the Graco snugride car seat. My boyfriend and I just had a baby and started taking him to daycare. We decided that I would take our baby to daycare on my way to work and he would pick him up after work. Well, it was a good plan, except for the fact that the first day we did this we ran into the problem that I had the base in my car and my boyfriend had no way of getting the car seat in his car. After that we instantly bought a second base for his car. Very convenient if you have more than one vehicle. Plus it isn't that expensive to have, better and cheaper than buying a whole second carseat.
B0042D69WY|5|My husband and I held off on purchasing a swing for our son, worried that he'd hate it and we'd be out a significant amount of money. But we finally broke down, and I'm so glad we bought the Snugabunny swing. Although our little guy isn't a super fussy baby, the swing has been a real sanity saver for us. Baby naps in it, and in the early days, he spent a couple of nights in it, too.<br /><br />The swing appears to be well-made, with soft fabrics that wash very nicely. There are several different music options that aren't terribly grating, although I wish there was an option to continuously play the music vs. having it automatically turn off after a certain length of time. Although the swing can operate in several different directions, we've never bothered as Baby likes the standard side-to-side motion. Finally, it is so nice to have baby gear that can plug in instead of using tons and tons of batteries.<br /><br />This was definitely one of our best baby gear buys, and I highly recommend this swing.<br /><br />January 30, 2013 Update: After a mere six months of use, the motor on the swing died. Fisher Price's customer service is great - they're sending a replacement at no cost, but it's back-ordered for a few months. We'll put the replacement motor in and then pack away the swing until Baby #2 comes along. But still, for a swing that cost as much as it did, I'm disappointed that the motor lasted only six months (albeit hours and hours of use each day).
B00A2HUFBA|4|This is a very secure and safe car seat. The only con is the straps do not adjust easily as there is not enough slack.
B0055PIUFW|5|These are not real silver. I bought these for a end of the world costume party they are cheap (price) and they fit my theme.
B00H882WGC|3|I read good review about this.. for some reason this came out the very next day. I did a good job in sticking..
B00465WERM|5|This is a great bag!! I use microfiber cloths to clean and I throw them in this bag and it never smells. I put the bag and dirty cloths right in the machine to wash. Great product!!  I added a small loop onto it so that I can hang it in the laundry room.
B002W33RH6|1|I bought 5 QBaby diapers to start my pocket diaper stash along with several other brands and these fit terribly and leaked even worse. When contacted , customer service was a joke, they promised to replace the diapers and never followed through. If you're looking for a inexpensive cloth diaper then I'd recommend checking the Dirty Diaper Laundry page and going through their reviews for diaper ratings and prices, or looking on Ebay for cheaper better quality diapers.
B00GSNFDQ4|5|Great purchase, all I can say is that I'm 130% happy with this product.
B00SGU7K5E|1|This product is pretty close to perfect. The lid is permanently attached to the cup so that's one less part to get lost. The only part that is removable is the clear silicone mouthpiece. The nearly straight walls make cleaning much easier than their Nuby competitors. Unlike the Nuby bottles, these don't leak all over the place, either. A high drop onto a hard floor will cause a few small drops to spray out, but that's all.  The only trick to this bottle is making sure the inner seal portion of the clear mouthpiece wraps around the inner wall it engages. If it isn't completely wrapped around you can expect leaks. When you get the bottle to inspect you'll see exactly what I mean.  -----UPDATE 9/1/2015  Changing my rating to one star because of one fatal flaw in this bottle. The rubber slit in the mouthpiece is made too thin and eventually tears open after repeated uses, allowing liquid to floe out wildly. If the rubber int his area were thicker, this bottle would be perfect. Such a shame.   If you can teach your baby how to use one, the Thermos funtainer bottles are superior to this bottle in every way. I have been using them for two years with my babies with no complaints. The are sturdy, easy to clean, and keep liquids hot or cold for very long periods of time which saves money on milk. I once left one of these bottles half full of milk in a 90 degree car for three hours. When I took the bottle apart and stuck my finger in the milk to check the temperature, it felt like it just came out of the fridge! While expensive they are definitely worth it. Those of you on a budget will be glad to know they can be found in thrift stores with relative ease and usually in the $1-$3 price range.

B003ZMLH34|5|Yeah...I thought it would be handy for finding them in the bassinet, but beyond that, it's nice to know that when I hear &#34;fussy breathing&#34; going on, I can glance over and see if it's that his pacifier fell out of his mouth or what....awe-some!!!!!!

B00AJSJCBG|5|This was very reasonably priced. It was packaged in a nice little box. The construction of the unit is very strong. The final test is my grandbaby loves it.
