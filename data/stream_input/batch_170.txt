0060977493|5.0|Let me preface this, I am not a literary expert and I do not consider myself to be a critic who know's what he is talking about.  But, I would have to say that this amazing book is worth every second of your time, and more!<br />First of all, the story is real; the kind that hits you hard, draws you in and breaks your heart.  However, I don't mena that in a cinamatic, Hollywood sort of way.  You might end up disliking some of the characters, but that's OK.  What's so amazing is that you and your neighbor Fred might disagree on who's good/bad and that's the beauty of it.<br />Secondly, writing is unique and beautiful.  As the book progresses, you fell like your in the Roy writing school and it doesn't matter what grade you get, your just glad to be there.  I've read places where they compare it to poetry, and that's cool, but it's something more, something higher then that... it's like..supra-neopoe-prose. (I just made that up).<br />Finally, the way the story is constructed keeps you on the edge of your hammock (wouldn't it be nice to kick back and read in a hammock?).  You never quite sure what Roy is getting at or where the story is going, and as the events unfold, they wil shock you and  draw you in deeper.<br />So read it already!  Fork up the cash, by a bottle of wine and tell your significant other to take a hike for the evening! you won't regret it.
6300218031|5.0|This was one of the cutest movies you will ever see. Eric Stotz was a place forever in my top actors as a result of this movie. He plays the kid who gets to date the girl who he has a crush on. He practices with another girl for the big date. She secretly has a crush on him also. He goes on his dream date. He and his dream girl show up at a party where the evil source in this movie confronts her and him. He is saved by a street gang thar he was in detention with. The ending is spectacular. This movie has it all. Good music,a good plot,good actors,everything. Buy this video and you will wear it out watching it.
B00005BJPO|5.0|OK, i have not yet even seen the DVD.. So I am not really RATING the DVD, i am rating the movie itself. And what a movie. Great plot, amazing sci-fi anime released 11 years ago. I downloaded a 218 MB asf version of this movie from the net because i could not find the VHS in stores, or in rental places. So i downloaded it. TERRIBLE quality, sound, etc. But, the movie itself, was truely amazing. Combined with good action, cool futuristic bikes, and plot. Along with pretty good anime for the 1980's. I thought the movie was amazing. In fact, I plan on ordering this DVD. The original one released by ORION apparently was not all that good (the one i saw). Apparently with the Pioneer release, they have re-done the entire thing. They cleaned up the video really nice, and they also re-dubbed it. Also, i heard that they translated all of the grafiti in the backshots. So that's quite a bit of work. Considering Pioneer did all of this within the 6 month area. I recommend you buy this DVD. If you liked Ghost in the Shell, theres no way you'll dislike this movie. In MY opinion, this movie is wayyy better than ghost in the shell. I didn't like ghost in the shell all that much, and frankly i was a little board. BUT, with akira, non-stop action, with great animation. Truely something you have to see for yourself!! Discover the secret of Akira!!
B00004WIDQ|1.0|This movie is totally lame. It is an established fact that dinosaurs died thousands of years ago and there are no dinos alive today. The story here is that somehow some of the dinos managed to hide in a little island unknown to man and survived, only to be discovered by the characters in the movie. It is so unbelievable that even my 8 year old kid brother was laughing at the absurd story.
6305807086|5.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is about a secret passage that allows anyone who crawls down it to peep into the mind of the actor John Malkovich.  The film portrays the havoc that the existence of this passage engenders, both in the life of John Malkovich, and in the lives of those who utilize this passage to get their own cheap thrills.  For the record, those thrills may be &quot;cheap&quot; at first, but very quickly they become far more costly to those who pursue them.<br />The storyline of this twisted, darkly hilarious movie shuttles back and forth between the viewpoint of John Malkovich, and the  viewpoint of the people who discover the secret passage.  These people include John Cusack, as a professionally unsuccessful puppeteer, named Craig; his wife Lottie, played by an almost alarmingly de-beautified Cameron Diaz; the office babe that Craig and Lottie both lust after, named Maxine, who is gleefully played by Catherine Keener; and finally, the genteel, grandfatherly, yet completely deranged owner of the business which occupies the floor in the building where the secret passage exists... if you are still reading after that swamp of prepositional phrases that I just became lost in, the business owner's name is Dr. Lester (as in &quot;Lester the Molester&quot;) and he is played by Orson Bean.<br />You must see this movie to appreciate the unbelievably twisted relationships these characters get involved in.  The best way to think of this movie is &quot;more twists and turns than a spiral staircase that has been filled neck-deep with neurotic pretzels.&quot;  Actually, that doesn't even begin to describe how twisted this movie is, but it's a fair start.  After seeing this, I guarantee you will feel incredibly curious about how Spike Jonze came up with the whole idea.  Here's my opinion -- I think the movie got started as the result of a bizarre late night conversation between the director and his friends, probably amidst many empty beer bottles, bootleg Greatful Dead albums, and bags of Doritos.  My guess is that Spike and Co. decided to take the actor's craft and turn it on its' head.  &quot;What if,&quot; they may have asked, &quot;an actor suddenly had the tables turned upon him?&quot;  An actor peeps into the minds of strangers for a living, to understand the characters he must play -- how would he like it if total strangers suddenly were able to do the same thing to him?  How would he like it if strangers seized the right to speak for him -- to literally put words in his mouth, and thoughts in his mind?  The result is the total chaos portrayed in this film.  If you think about it, all the main characters are really quite vampiric, or, you could even say, demonic -- they take over another person's body for their own purposes.  They basically possess him.  I think video libraries with a certain sense of humor could shelve this movie next to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; -- it makes a twisted kind of sense, if you think about it...<br />An interesting subplot is the commentary this movie contains about the nature of obsessive &quot;love.&quot;  Craig and Lottie both lust after Maxine, but in order to be with her, their only option is to go through the body and soul of John Malkovich...  What does this have to say about this kind of &quot;love?&quot;  Can we draw any lessons from this?    There was a song popular in the 80s, I forget who sang it, which was called &quot;Obsession.&quot;  One of the lyrics went &quot;who do you want me to be/to make you sleep with me?&quot;  Forgive me for attaching cosmic meaning to a basically forgettable 80s tune, but, well, if you see this movie you'll agree with me that it has a lot of relevance.<br />This is a seriously weird movie, but one you will never forget.  I recommend the living daylights out of it.  It's definitely worth owning -- you'll want to see it again and again.  Two thumbs way up.

But a warning my dear American cousins, Bill Bryson does exaggerate the dangers of Australian wildlife.   Do you see grizzly bears in Central Park?  Methinks he doth protest too much!

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is, quite simply, one of the greatest albums of all time.  It is ironic, however, to think that this album owes its success to what I believe to be its worst track, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (track one).  It immeadiately improves after this with the singles &quot;In Bloom&quot; and the brilliantly aquatic &quot;Come As You Are&quot;.  However, the album does not reach a crescendo, in my opinion, until the second half in which the two best songs (&quot;Drain You&quot; and &quot;On A Plain&quot;) lie.  Part of this album's brilliance, however, was its ability to gain praise from the critics and public alike.  Very few bands are able to do this.  The critics, more often than not, get it right.  They can identify the good bands from the poor (i.e. the dire music we hear in the charts which the general public like).  However with Nevermind, Kurt Cobain managed to create superb music which appealed to the public in such a manner that it will probably never be equalled and surely never surpassed.
B000000WF0|5.0|I first bought this cd on recommendation from a friend who assured me &quot;every song on this cd is really good.&quot;  I had only heard bittersweet symphony at that point, but I trusted his judgement.  Right out of the record store I put the cd into my car stereo and started listening.  And I was instantly captivated by Bittersweet Symphony as I had been when I had first heard it on the radio.  But then as I sifted through the tracks, I realized that Bittersweet Symphony was only the beginning, and, although an excellent song,it is not nearly the aural achievement of the rest of the album.  The next song that really struck me was &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; and after that, as I listened to the cd more and more, other songs, especially &quot;this time&quot; captivated my mind.  I could not walk anywhere, or do anything without hearing these songs echoing through my head.  The Verve is unique from anything else I have ever heard because of the artfully crafted and blended sounds of Nick McCabe's ground-shattering guitars and Richard Ashcroft's beautifully clear voice, which always maintains a tinge of sadness.  Every track is comprised of a brilliant texture of sounds, that are the modern rock version of a symphony.  I have listened to this album many times, and during each listen I hear another instrumental voice or sound which enhances my appreciation for this brilliant band.<br />After &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; I went on to purchase their other albums, which are in themselves masterworks, but UH stands above the rest, and is largely the reason why The Verve is my favorite band.  I bought this album on faith from a friend, and was blown away with what I heard.  I don't care whether you buy these songs or download them; have faith, if you listen carefully to them, they will expand your ideas of rock as a genre and the guitar as instrument.
B000009O8A|1.0|Interesting footnote:  My good friend Terry was the neighbor of a starving young actress a couple of decades ago who was hired to be the model whose backside you see as she's holding a knife on the poster for this film.  Her name: Demi Moore.
0792844793|5.0|...<br />Here Lynch's characters, though outrageous, mildly believeable and at times monsters, are more real than in his later efforts, WILD AT HEART, TWIN PEAKS and LOST HIGHWAY, and his plot, which was called Hitchcockian in early reviews, makes much more sense than in anything he has done since (with the exception of the self-consciously normal STRAIGHT STORY).<br />The performances are world class. The movie ressurrected the career of Dennis Hopper and allowed him to go on to make millions in WATERWORLD and SPEED playing a watered-down version of his Frank character. It also made stars out of Laura Dern and Kyle MacLachlan -- and sank the career of Isabella Rossellini, who was dating Lynch at the time. <br />Though the shocking plot which centers around the sexual abuse of the Rossellini character and an innocent young man (played by MacLachlan) who tries to save her comes with the &quot;not for everyone&quot; warning, at least there is an emotional depth to the horrors that I found missing in the gothic WILD AT HEART and the tedious TWIN PEAKS.
B00005MP58|4.0|This is a fantastic movie and its very helpful to have it on dvd BUT it is still in the same form as it is on vhs. What I mean is that the credits are there after every section the same as on the vhs and the same as when it was on tv. That was pretty annoying. and like all dvd's it tends to skip every once and a while. but nothing lasting. its a great movie, well worth the long 6 hour watch.<br />Jenna
B00003CXE6|5.0|Gladiator is a richly textured, well-written, and most of all truly spectacular film, powered by Russell Crowe's superb, Oscar-winning performance. Filled with epic battles, striking scenery, and first-rate acting, Gladiator is certainly not to be missed. <br /> The story begins in Germania, where the Roman Army is preparing to vanquish the last of the barbaric tribes there. The opening battle scene is a harrowing, masterfully crafted piece of work, thanks to fine editing, brilliant cinematography, and of course, Hans Zimmer's excellent music. The battle footage is dark, vivid, and grisly, bringing out the horrors of war in a truly gripping fashion. The film shifts to a camp after the battle, and two of the most crucial scenes in the movie take place here, involving Commodus, Maximus, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who is also the father of Commodus. After Marcus Aurelius names Maximus his succesor, Commodus kills his father and has Maximus arrested. Yet the general manages to dispatch his executioners and is taken with a slave caravan and is sold to Proximo, a slave owner. After winning battles in Africa, the group travels to Rome.... and you can guess the rest.<br /> Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for. Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and in telligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence. The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him. Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role. But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much. The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.<br /> Ridley Scott's direction is well done, keeping the story moving along at a reasonable pace. (My only complaint: What the heck is some cheesy fart joke doing in this film?!) The screenplay is full of memorable lines and keeps everything in a classic tradition. John Mathieson's cinematography is terrific, with breathtaking shots and exquisite lighting. I really like how most of the beginning sequences are dismal and gray, and the scenes in Rome are sunny and bright, (Maximus says that Rome is the light). The production design is elaborate and and Rome is visually stunning, thanks to some seamlessly crafted computer work. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and diverse, at some points rousing and at others somber, overall extremely effective and beautiful.   The battle scenes are dazzlingly shot and edited, the standout being where Maximus and his fellow gladiators battle Roman charioteers. Still the others are eye-popping, graphically impressive pieces of work. And the ending is unforgettable. <br /> Overall, in my opinion Gladiator was the best film of the year and is a powerhouse, tour-de-force film spectacle.
B000002BUY|5.0|This Cd is amazing it's got a nice and hard beat with lovely vocals. If you like MAKE YOURSELF and &quot;Pardon me&quot; you'll love this CD.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Enough Cannot be said! Moulin Rouge, is Great!  It has it all! Really, story, music, acting, effects, costumes.....Every part of this film is Top Quality. I call it Mind-Choreographed it is as if you dreamed it. How this could have been made? Only one answer.Every single person involved in this production must have LOVED To make it. THANK YOU! Every Person who WORKED on this Film !!!!!!!!
B00003CWL6|2.0|Yes, everyone is having some type of crisis in this movie, after all they live in Suburbia don't they?  The actors do a good job with the material provided, but the script is so loaded with cliches that no amount of acting ability can bring the characters to life.  'The Ice Storm' provides a more detailed (and believable) look at suburban families in crisis.  'American Beauty' on the other hand tries to substitute cynicism for insight.  This is pretty commonplace these days.  It gives screenwriters the chance to congratulate themselves for 'deep' material and film critics the chance to use terms like 'dysfunctional family'.  It doesn't make a great movie however.   Worth a rental if you haven't seen it, just to see what the buzz is (or was) about.
0679879269|4.0|Philip Pullman is a true master of words. He commands them like flowing water and can tell a wonderfully beautiful story as he did with The Amber Spyglass. He resolves things quite nicely but he did it in way that seemed a bit manipulative to me. Philip Pullman has his views and I think he's just trying a little too hard to make me believe what he does. Otherwise, I commend Philip Pullman on a job well done on ending a rather difficult series. I just hope that in the future he puts art before anything else as he had told himself to do in interviews. That's all.

B000002UA0|5.0|If you like the Pink Floyd of the 70's, you won't like this cd. The sound is completely different of the other Floyd albums. But this album is esspecially Syd Barrett's work. And the songs are crazy and funny. When Syd had to leave Pink Floyd a new band was born (albums like Animals,The Wall,Dark Side Of The Moon,Wish You Were Here etc are also stunning) but the band wasn't crazy and funny anymore. Buy this album if you listen you can hear how good Syd was.
B000002JS6|5.0|after the death of bon scott are thought the band was dead  too.but they came back as hard as ever.brian johnson filled in for bons shoes very well.this was the only release i wore out 2 lps and two tapes playing this one.thank god for cds. hells bells,have a drink on me,shoot to thrill and let me put my love into you this rocks this is a must have for any one and i sure most every one owns a copy of back in black
6305470464|5.0|This movie is great!  I dislike, though, how it switches from story to story.  Angie jolie is great, she has some great lines and her hair and makeup is great!  Spectacular acting.  She has attitude in this movie, and she plays a vulnerable person, but at the same time scared, unsure, young and vibrant!  you should watch it even if you aren't a jolie fan.
B000005TQO|5.0|I first heard Laura Pausini on a speaker outside a music store in a small Mexican resort.  Without knowing anymore about her, I went in and bought the CD.  It was all in Spanish and although I could understand little of it .... who cares ... the sound was smooth and relaxing.  I soon discovered that she was actually Italian and also records in French, English and of course Italian as well. It is hard to believe that she has not cracked the North American Market (among the English anyway) If you arelooking for a smooth, angelic voice (in any language) you can't find a better one than Laura Pausini! HIGHLY recommended. Joe (in Canada)
0783113943|5.0|this is probably one of jolie's best works.  In an article, jolie said that this movie hit close to home because jolie, too, had done drugs and she also modeled as a kid, and she has a knife fetish.  This is the closest role Angie has ever done that is so much like her.  gia is the movie to see, it's spectacular.  i love jolie in roles like this, as a person with a problem, kind of crazy, and she plays it perfectly.  that's why i love girl, interrupted.  2 similar roles.  if you like gia, you'll love girl, interrupted. though jolie doesn't resemble gia carangi,  she was absolutly excellent.  i dont know one person who disliked this movie at all.  and, i loved that they showed her tattoo, i love when they show her tattoos and don't cover them up.  And, her hair in this movie is wild, and she seemed to have gained more weight in this movie, but she still lookes excellent!
0792833236|4.0|Making a film like &quot;Raging Bull&quot; in the era of &quot;Rocky,&quot; was a gutsy and perverse thing to do.<br />I can't think of another director but Martin Scorsese who could have pulled it off (well, almost...the film was a commercial failure.)<br />Shot in stark black and white to re create the in your face tabloid look of the 40's and 50's, Scorcese, with a tour de force De Niro performance made a film which, like its protagonist, is both repellant and fascinating.<br />Scorsese's genius for recreating the look and feel of an era is all over &quot;Raging Bull&quot; from the local neighborhood swimming pool to the mob social halls to the seedy night clubs..no other director seems to have this kind of eye for detail.<br />The supporting performances are magnificent: Joe Pesci's Joey is one of the great supporting performances of ANY decade...Cathy Moriarty as Vicki is sensational...her Bronx nasal twang always seems at odds with her stark blonde beauty.<br />&quot;Raging Bull&quot; is undoubtedtly brilliant filmmaking, but it leaves you feeling hollow...the truth is a lot of talented poeple made a fantastic film about a guy whose one attribute in life was that he could take a beating.<br />In many way &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is like Jake La Motta's comment about his overcooked steak: &quot;it defeats its own purpose.&quot; ********* The DVD issue leaves a lot to be desired...the black and white transfer is crisp and clear, but there are NO special features to speak of....no making of documentary, no interviews with cast and crew....the commentary Scorsese did for the laserdisc version is also missing.<br />How about it MGM/UA??<br />A film of this stature deserves a Special Edition reissue which includes more than just a skimpy little booklet.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Having heard a few of the songs from different Blink 182 albums, I decided to purchase this. It is amazing. Every song is unique and the lyrics are well-written. &quot;All the Small Things&quot; is one of my favorites, along with &quot;Going Away to College&quot; and &quot;Aliens Exist&quot;. I have had this CD for over a year and a half, and I still listen to it regularly, and will continue to do so. I am so glad I bought this CD, and I recommend that you buy it also.
B00003CY5H|4.0|This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder when and what is going to go wrong. The characters kept the movie interesting. De Niro was perfect for the part. Norton was excellent. The twist at the end made you want to stand up and cheer for De Niro.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Great album, strange partnership. More like a Blur record, it has many songs that would blow your mind. Rich sound looping, and armonic combinatios will make this CD a completely must buy.<br />Maybe for an enhanced CD a secret link, a collection of wallpapers and a Screensaver isn´t too much, a selection f promotional videos would have been a good choice.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrmann's musical masterpiece is a mind-blowing spectacle of color, music and genius. From the black and white poverty-stricken streets of Paris to the frenzied can-can dancing inside the club Mouling Rouge, this film had me mesmerized every second.   I've noticed many people seem to flinch at the frenzied scene changes and peculiar soundtrack. Indeed, this movie is strange.. That's what I love about it. It doesn't adhere to the rules.  It's different and daring and I believe people will get a lot more out of it if they sit back and just go with it. Enjoy it...don't question it. Allow yourself to be swept away from reality and absorbed into this alternate Bohemian world. Experience the magic of Moulin Rouge.
B00004W50Z|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  Stage Fright by The Band has many quality songs.  Strawberry Wine bops along quite nicely with some good edgy vocals by Levon Helm and beautiful instrumental interplay.  The Band was legendary for their interplay between the guitar and the two layers of keyboards not mention horn sections.  Anyway, W.S. Walcotts Medicine Show, Stage Fright, The Shape I'm In, Time To Kill, and Daniel And The Sacred Harp are other stand out tracks.  The other tracks that I did not mention are not band in any way.  However, The Band has recorded other songs particularly on their first two releases that are of higher quality such as The Weight, We Can Talk About It, Long Black Veil, Up On Cripple Creek, and The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.  Even the best songs on Stage Fright fall a bit short of the Band's best work.  And W.S. Wallcott's Medicine Show, Stage Fright, and The Shape I'm In have much more enthusiasm on the Live Rock Of Ages.  Therefore to my ears a three/maybe a three and a half star rating sounds appropriate.
B000002H2H|4.0|This album explores dying from many points of view.  Fight Fire with Fire is about nuclear war, Ride the Lightning is about the electric chair, For Whom the Bell tolls is about war, Fade to Black(a great song) is about suicide.  Trapped under ice is about drowning, Escape is about war again, Creeping Death is about the Angel of Death creeping through Egypt, killong the first-born sons, and Call of Ktulu is one God Almighty intrumental(the best one at that).
B000002KDX|5.0|Out of all of the America CD's that I have heard,I think that the best are &quot;America,&quot;&quot;Homecoming,&quot;&quot;Hat trick&quot; and &quot;Hideaway.&quot; The &quot;America&quot; CD,in my mind,stands out as one of their fresh and different creations. I like all of the songs on the CD. Some stand-outs are: &quot;Three Roses&quot;-A six string acoustic guitar gem with an impressive guitar solo by Gerry Beckley. &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot;-A six and twelve string guitar collaboration with synchronous leads, written by Dan Peek. But the song that I like the best is &quot;A Horse with no name.&quot;    Being a bit of a loner myself, I think that the song represents the human expression of solemnity with its haunting words and melodies. Dewey Bunnell is my favorite songwriter in the group and I think &quot;A Horse with no name&quot; is a peak effort. This song sounds so rich and full for a song that only has two acoustic guitars (six and twelve string),bass guitar,congas and drums. With a comparison to todays recording standards, this song is evenly matched in richness and clarity. Gerry Beckley even pulls off a twelve string solo! This CD will be a gem in your collection!
0452281881|5.0|It's original, it's hilariously funny, it's well written and it's probably a fairly accurate description of life inside a top Advertising Agency.<br />Matt Beaumont has skillfully told his story through a series of e-mails. Sounds dreary? Not at all, 'e' rates as one of a few that I put into the unputdownable category. Once you're into the heads of the major players, you just keep going - and going - until the last page. As other reviewers have pointed out, Beaumont has been able to characterize his major players in the style and content of the notes they send.<br />If you're looking for this month's read - buy 'e'.

0140157352|5.0|The authors propose that all the world's difficulties could be resolved if only parties adhered to the principles of negotiation outlined in this book.  I doubt, of course, that the Israelis and Palenstinians, for example, could find an ever-lasting peace simply by adhering to the principles laid out in this book.  Such thinking is reductive, naive and quite possibly arrogant.  In any event, that caveat aside, what the authors present is an interesting set of tools one can use in negotiating with another party.  While most people will find themselves negotiating in situations far less dire than that of the Israelis and Palestinians (a business deal, a divorce, inheritances, etc.), the tools _in theory_ are applicable everywhere.  However, the authors fail to prove that the tools are _in practice_ applicable everywhere.  This failure to prove the tools' applicability in practice may be attributable to the authors' hailing from the theoretical shield of academia.
B00003CXN3|1.0|I have become convinced that there are two movies out there with the name Traffic.  One is the phenomenal movie that won the Academy award and the other is the movie that I saw.  I can't believe that so many people thought that this was such a great movie.  It was like watching paint dry, except that once paint has dried, something creative has usually occurred.  Traffic was nothing more than one long series of scenes taken from other hack movies that had been pieced together.  The script was trite and filled with all the overused cliches from all the movies the scenes were pilfered from.  I know that the politicians that appeared throughout the movie are shameless but I expected more from Michael Douglas and the rest of the cast.  I don't want to sound too apathetic, but I can read the headlines almost any day of the week and put together more intrigue, suspense, and sense of reality than this movie portrayed.  Someone please tell me where I can get a copy of the other Traffic!  I know it's out there and just waiting for me to see it and replace the sense of total empty boredom that the version I watched left me with.
B000002KXO|2.0|The Mac's most underrated album is still a pleasure to listen to nineteen years later; in fact the songs actually sound less dated and more contemporary than the Rumours-era stuff, aside from \\"Gypsy,\\" which was on the radio constantly during the early/mid eighties (and is still a sublime piece of work). The problem is that the audio quality on this CD is atrocious--low fidelity, tape hiss, etc. One would do better to get an original vinyl copy, which, believe it or not, is a vast improvement over the transfer that was done here. Let's hope Warner Bros. gets around to restoring this one soon...

B000002BSG|2.0|Jamiroquai's &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; gets off to a great start...then fumbles somewhere along the third track.<br />&quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; is a great song with a awesome beat, insightful lyrics, and, if you've seen it, a provocative video. &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; is a funky, disco beat with great lyrics (&quot;Sends me into hyperspace when I see that pretty face&quot;). But, when &quot;Use the Force&quot; starts, the album loses steam and plunges into boring R&amp;B cliches and monotonous melodies.<br />Songs like &quot;Hard Times&quot; reduce lyrics until the chorus is being repeated over and over again (and it wasn't very good to begin with). The two instrumentals sound like tracks from nature CDs (the second being the better track). But, the thing that I can't understand is that the title track is NOT GOOD. When bands name an entire album after one song, that song is supposed to sound interesting, fun, and...well, GOOD. But it has annoying car sound effects and an utter lack of cohesion. I don't even think there are any verses in that song!<br />It's a shame that two great songs should have to follow eleven tracks of &quot;blah&quot;. But, I'm not giving up on Jamiroquai yet. After I write this review, I'll be looking into their newest release &quot;A Funk Odyssey&quot;. Hopefully, it'll sound better than &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot;.

B000002H33|5.0|The first Metallica CD I bought was ...And Justice for All. After being blown away I quickly bought Master of Puppets. This CD .... As a fellow heavy metal guru I can personally gurantee that there is nothing else like it, that goes for every other Metallica CD as well. I highly recomend that you check this one out. You will not be dissapointed.
0784011206|5.0|Don't let Rambo's reputation fool you. If your only familiarity with that name is from the press or it's use in modern lingo, you probably would have come to expect that &quot;First Blood&quot; is a mindless gore-fest. That couldn't be further from the truth.<br />John Rambo is a Green Beret who was held in a POW camp in Nam. Having been brutally tortured there, he suffers from post-traumatic stress, which causes his encounter with a small town sheriff to go awry. Stallone portrays Rambo with the perfect mix of sensitivity and stoicism to make him both human and the warrior he was trained to be.<br />Rambo enters the little Pacific Northwestern town searching for an old war buddy whom he learns has died. After being arrested by Sheriff Teasle, horrible flashbacks of his POW experience send Rambo into a panic in which he violently attacks the police officers and flees. Teasle is determined to hunt him down, but his efforts are thwarted by Rambo's traps and war survival prowess. When Rambo's trainer, Trautman, appears on the scene, an intriguing dynamic develops between he and Teasle as they argue over Rambo's fate.<br />The characters are well-developed and well-acted, and the film makes some interesting statements about war. The violence, which is tame by today's standards, is used as a tool to tell the story without being gratuitous. This is one of the best of the classic '80's films and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes action movies with substance.
6305165912|4.0|I have been familiar with Lebowski since it was first previewed on TV and in theaters in '98, but up until June of this year hadn't seen the film.  For some insane reason, I didn't think it was going to be good.  I was wrong, man.  <br />The film was chosen by the instructor of my Interanalytical Writing course for the class to view and write a paper on.  Our purpose was to compare &quot;The Dude&quot; to the traditional hero or &quot;outlaw&quot; hero, using two corresponding essays from our text.  Its more fun than it sounds.<br />The film itself is very unique.  Bridges plays Jeff &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski, a lazy, unemployed, pot smoking, White Russian sipping, Bowler, leftover from the hippie generation.  One day the Dude is met at home by two thugs who mistake him for a millionaire (the Big Lebowski) who's wife owes a lot of money to their boss.  The thugs dunk the Dude's head in the toilet and urinate on his favorite rug that &quot;ties the room together&quot; - Not cool.  Dude takes his &quot;rug problem&quot; to the Big Lebowski (BL), who gives him a lecture and sends him away.  The Dude takes it upon himself to pick out a rug from the BL's mansion on the way out.<br />Next, Bunny, the BL's young, porn star, wife is supposedly kidnapped and the BL summons the Dude to take the &quot;ransom&quot; to the &quot;Nihilist&quot; kidnappers who are holding her.  The Dude is aided and hindered (mostly hindered) by his loyal pal, Walter (Goodman), a Vietnam vet with a short temper, love for bowling, obligation to his ex wife's dog, and a refusal to do anything on the Sabbath, since he has converted to Judaism.  The Dude meets many characters along the way such as Jesus the bowler, Maude the feminist/artist and daughter of the BL, Ulee the porn star/Nihilist who has a pet ferret and used to have his own Kraftwerk like band (who have an album called &quot;Autobahn&quot;, hmm interesting.), and maybe most importantly, the &quot;Stranger&quot;, who appears at the bowling alley bar twice to help the Dude.<br />I won't reveal anymore specifics in case anyone else has neglected to witness this masterpiece.  I don't understand why viewers compare this to Fargo (1996).  They are totally different movies and Lebowski is much funnier and less dark in my opinion.  The one thing that Lebowski does have in common with Fargo and other films by the Coen Brothers, like Raising Arizona (1987) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (2000) are unique, often unforgettable characters.  Whether it is &quot;Hi&quot; or Leonard Smalls from Raising, Marge or Carl and Gaear (the kidnappers) from Fargo, Ulysses, Pete, or Delmar from O Brother, or The Dude, Walter, and Jesus from Lebowski - You can guarantee they won't leave your mind too soon after meeting them. <br />My favorite scene from the BL?  When Walter and The Dude go to question Larry Sellers (the 15 year old son of Arthur Digby Sellers - comatose writer of 156 episodes &quot;The bulk of the series&quot; of &quot;Branded&quot;) about the missing money that was in the Dude's car.  Walter begins with a polite questioning that goes nowhere and follows with &quot;Plan B&quot; where he goes outside and using a crowbar, destroys what he thinks is the sports car that Larry bought with the money.  Walter repeatedly yells, &quot;Larry, this is what happens when you F a stranger up the ass!!!&quot;  but  guess what? - its not Larry's car!  Priceless scene****Priceless Movie****Buy it or be very &quot;un-dude&quot;.<br />The DVD has widescreen/full screen options and looks great - Most importantly, it has a 30 min interview with the Coens.
6304795254|5.0|Don't read this if you haven't seen the film. Don't read this if you believe film critics ------ Sure, it's dark and winding, murky and confusing at times, but the film's ultimate message is that of hope. The entire film (read: the entire &quot;game&quot;) is designed to keep a depressed person from killing himself. What could be more positive? It's a two hour long anti-suicide mission.  Choose life, no matter how dark it gets. Great message, great film. Period.
B000002L7J|5.0|Seems like everyone thinks this is either their best or worst album. I think it's neither, but every song is different and brilliant on it's own. Most of the songs have are pretty laid back, and it feels quite apparent that there was a lot more time spent writing them. I'd also like to say that the title track &quot;Meat is Murder&quot; is amazing. A beautiful six minute epic that I wish was longer.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is a cracker - quite honestly the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year!! I had no expectations before seeing this movie and was blown away.<br />The plot? Who cares? I have now seen it four times and plot makes no difference as each time I take in the splendour of the Moulin Rouge, the wonderful music and the perfect performances. The set is fantastic, and a great shame it has been destroyed as it is the heart of the movie. The music draws on the classics of the 20th Century - everything from Freddie Mercury to Madonna, is made over in the Luhrmann style. Finally the actors are perfect in the roles, the two standouts being Ewan McGregor, both in fine voice and looking ever the dashing hero and Jim Broadbent, the underrated British actor, who almost steals the movie from its leads with his eccentric version of &quot;Like A Virgin (you have to see it to believe it!!) As for Ms Kidman, she is also very good and Mr Cruise will be ruing his decision to leave her after seeing this (which I hope he does).<br />Go and see this movie - it is brilliant, outstanding, unbelievable - go and see it!
B000006045|5.0|all i can say is wow. my uncle lives in bristol and was always preaching about these guys. he knows del naja personally and played footie with them when they were less famous. it is my favourite album ever. i could listen to it over and over again because there are so many layers of music in it. the triphop, the spine chilling high voice, del naja's mysterious voice, and all the instruments that make massive attack the most excellent 'soundsystem' there is.  they are just the best there is. its excellent to chill to. to be inspired to. to philosophise to. to go to sleep to. trouble is that not many people i know like them. but thats good in ways. it makes me mroe individual.my fave songs on it are inertia creeps, dissolved girl, group four, black milk and risingson. Ursula anything to say to me.
B00000J7SS|1.0|Although I am sure I will get a lot of hell for this from people, I really truly CAN'T STAND this album!  I am a casual fan of Miles' work from the '50s like 'Birth of the Cool' and particularly the classic 'Kind of Blue', but, this????  What is this????  It's like an awful mismash of noise and, if you ask me, it is an insult to traditional jazz.  I realize that I am going to get a lot of people's blood pressure rising with this review, but I must speak my opinion on this.  This album, and the EVEN WORSE Agharta album take the beautiful art of jazz and try and meld it into something new and &quot;hip&quot; that is completely unnecessary.  I apologize to all for this review, but I hate this album, and fusion jazz in general.<br />0 of 2,365,788 people found this review helpful.
B00004Z459|5.0|What a wonderful surprise!!  When Linkin Park first hit the radio airwaves, many people thought they were another &quot;one hit wonder&quot; rap/rock band.  It was a terrific surprise to hear that &quot;Closer to the edge&quot; was only 1 of many fantastic songs on this cd.  They just get better and better upon each listen, which is why this cd is so addicting.  &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; are songs that I can listen to non-stop.  For anyone who considers them another rap-rock band, just listen to the songs I just mentioned.  I actually do not like the bands who are in the genre that Linkin Park is placed in because the lyrics and music of such bands are (for lack of a better word- infantile).  Linkin Park puts thought into their lyrics and as other reviewers have noted, use good music to make an effect, as oppossed to using the F word during a whole song.   What makes LP unique is that the focus is on the melody, with the rap complimenting the songs, instead of being the sole focus.  They are a rock band first, as opposed to being rappers with guitars.  In fact, it is the singing that makes the cd - Chester can scream with the best of them, but when he sings, he really sings (and doesn't sound like he was pumped with steriods like the Godsmack type bands).  Let's hope the band continues to gain recognition and set the new standard.  This cd was very well done, and will appeal to anyone who is a rock fan (or techno fan, since the instrumental on the cd could very well have been on Moby's &quot;Play&quot; cd.).  If you want to restore your faith in rock, pick up this cd.  You'll have it on repeat again..and again..!
0800132335|5.0|Das Boot has been one of my favorite movies for quite a long time. Wolfgang Petersen did a great job directing this movie, creating a sense of fear and claustrophobia, as well as camaraderie with the crew of the U-96. The sound is so gripping that I was fearing for my life when you could hear the sonar pings of british sub trying to locate our friends in the U-96. I didn't dare make a peep at that point for fear of giving them away. The only negative things I have to say about this version, is the subtitles. At some spots they are a bit inaccurate.
B00004SGNJ|5.0|As emotional as Hawkins' &quot;supreme&quot; album; as heart-gripping as Paul Gonsalves' duet with Earl Hines on &quot;over the rainbow&quot;; as essential as Lester's last sessions; as fragile as any Pee Wee Russell's record of the late fifties or sixties; a milestone in the jazz history. Outstanding versions of &quot;I'm a fool to want you&quot;,&quot;you've changed&quot;,&quot;but beautiful&quot;,&quot;violets for your furs&quot;.Maybe not the easier way to discover Billie, because she was dying, because her voice was almost gone, but for the one who loves her, this session will be treasured forever.
B00005N5S5|5.0|as it has been said below, the uk disk has been out ages now. finally the yanks can get this lush set. also, the t2 region 2 disk will be missing half the extras, the german conpany making it are too incompetent to make the seamlesss branching on the r2 disk, so theres only 1 version of the film, as opposed to 3. and some of the second side/disk features will also be missing becaause theres too much on there really.<br />another note, terminator 3 is in production. james isnt writting or directing so my question is wheres the point of it?

0060975768|5.0|War is a terrible waste. Beautiful lives horribly cut off. In that sense, &quot;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot; is a very disturbing read. When encountering graphic descriptions of combat, at Ia Drang, I imagined every soldier killed or maimed could have been one or both of my boys (in reality they had not been born during the Vietnam era). The heart break of the surviving spouse, child, parent is poignantly told. We should all be continually praying for peace. But, it is also a story of brave and honorable men. If war does come, I hope our soldiers are of the caliber of  Moore and the 7th Cavalry. For those of you that served in Vietnam, thank you and God bless you. For those that made the ultimate sacrifice, &quot;Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives to all generations&quot; (Sirach 44.14). Thank you Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway for writing &quot;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot;.
0553106635|4.0|&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is the third book of George R.R. Martin's six-volume epic, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot;  His characters continue to be unlucky in love, and not all of the four kings who were still alive at the end of volume II, make it through volume III.<br />If I were a king in one of Martin's fantasies and someone suggested it was high time I married, I'd jump on my destrier and gallop like hell for the nearest monastery.  It would be safer to enlist in the Night Watch and fight animated corpses beyond the Wall of Ice than it would be to take a bride.<br />Speaking of which, the Night Watch and its enemies beyond the Wall come into much sharper focus in volume III.  Barbaric tribes of Wildlings begin to fight their way over the Wall, driven by the supernatural Others and their own living dead.  Most of the battle scenes take place at or near the Wall in &quot;A Storm of Swords,&quot; although the Queen across the Water, Daenerys Targaryen fights a few of her own while freeing slaves and raising her three dragons.<br />Martin doesn't spare his reader the gory details of medieval warfare or courtly love, which is why I don't think he should be compared to T. H. White (&quot;The Once and Future King&quot;).  Martin harkens back to the older, medieval legends of Arthur (e.g. Mallory's &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot;) where the knights were a much bloodier, bawdier lot---not the types that Disney would want to immortalize.<br />T. H. White's advice on the battles and tournaments, &quot;Let's skip the parts where Sir Somebody smote somebody...,&quot; was definitely not taken to heart by Martin.  In his first three volumes, knights routinely whack off each other's collops, codpieces, and assorted body parts.  Four of the narrators in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; are mutilated---a nose, a hand, and four finger joints go missing; the young boy-narrator, Brandon Stark was thrown from a window (in volume I) and paralyzed.<br />There are a couple of regicides, a patricide (or an attempted patricide), and a wife murder in volume III, plus other killings too numerous to mention.<br />The two Stark daughters, Princess Sanya (age 12) and Princess Arya (age 10) continue their narratives in  &quot;A Storm of Swords.&quot;  Sanya is bent on escaping from the Lannisters who rule in the name of Joffrey, the boy king.  Arya, who has already escaped is bent on avenging the death of her father.  Every night before she falls asleep, she recites the names of the people she wants to kill.  She is an innocent yet repellent little girl who bullies her friends and kills people in order to survive.  Her sister Sanya is much more passive.  She still believes that someday a noble prince will show up and ride off into the sunset with her.<br />However, she is now certain that her noble prince is not a Lannister.<br />Martin has created a harsh, yet dazzling world where even children have to kill or be killed.cides, a patricide (or an attempted patricide), and a wife murder in volume III, plus other killings too numerous to mention.<br />The two Stark daughters, Princess Sanya (age 12) and Princess Arya (age 10) continue their narratives in  &quot;A Storm of Swords.&quot;  Sanya is bent on escaping from the Lannisters who rule in the name of Joffrey, the boy king.

B000003BF1|5.0|I know i might get blasted for this but I have always had mixed feelings about the Stones.  While their popularity and endurance cannot be denied, they have never been at the top of my list. i do still like them and own about 10 or so of their cd's.  I find I like this one the most. this is a great album that is highly listenable. (i find some girls tiring) Gimme Shelter is a classic.  Highly recommended.
B00005J9M1|5.0|As a lifelong Pet Shop Boys fan, I had some reservations about purchasing an album that I already owned, simply for a bonus CD that was included in the reissue. However, this is essential listening for both completists and for casual listeners. For those new to the Pet Shop Boys, there is probably no better introduction to their output, with the possible exception of their greatest hits disc, &quot;Discography.&quot;The reviews for &quot;Very&quot; (the original album) speak for themselves. This is a brilliant and highly listenable album. The extra CD features remixes, single versions, b-sides, demo tracks, a live recording, and a fascinating commentary on each song by Chris and Neil.Highlights on the extra disc include a live version of Blur's &quot;Girls and Boys&quot; (which sounded like a PSB song when Blur recorded it), a PSB version of a song that they produced for Tina Turner on her &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; CD (&quot;Confidential&quot;), the rare single version of their tribute to the BBC show &quot;Absolutely Fabulous,&quot; and a nearly eight-minute remix of &quot;Go West.&quot; The remixes are true to the source material, though, and one can still recognize the song on which they were based. There are also several tracks that appeared on the b-sides compilation &quot;Alternative,&quot; and while there may be some duplication in a true fan's CD library, it is worth it just to see what influences were working back and forth between the duo while recording &quot;Very.&quot;The songs themselves are faithful to the sound that the duo were exploring during this time. Lots of Hi-NRG tracks with a touch of techno. One song on the bonus CD, &quot;Euroboy,&quot; sounds as if it may be the &quot;What was that song?&quot; track one hears every night in a club.To sum it up, this is worth your money.

6305327084|5.0|I came across this movie at the exact time I attended my 10 year highschool reunion.  Timing could not be more perfect.  I guess this is why this movie touched me especially because the movie is about a bunch of friends who meet again for there 10 year highschool reunion.  Alot of the questions that were asked by Timothy Hutton at the crossroads of his life I have personally asked myself.  <br />The plot is about a bunch of highschool friends, with emphpasis on the guys, that reach that infamous crossroad of their life - the late 20 year olds who have to make a decision on whether or not to take a more permenant path in life or continue to chase childhood dreams and past glories.  They see some of their friends who have settled down and have raised a family and live in utter bliss and they ask themselves what to do next in their life.  <br />One especially touching conversation for me was a conversation between Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman when they went Ice fishing.  Timothy Hutton has for sometime been in a relationship with a woman that he could certainly settle down with.  However he meets Natalie Portman and the feeling of new love starts to overcome him.  Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman discuss the issue of settling down with a stable relationship or living life continously experiencing new love.  After all, nothing feels like the feeling of new love.  A discussion that many of us have asked at one time in our life when we reached that age when we realized that we weren't getting any younger.   <br />I dont want to spoil the movie by revealing too much so I suggest that you watch it.
B000005RYQ|5.0|This greatest hits package costs a few bucks more than the Singles album but it contains Syncronicity II and Tea in the Sahara, which justifies the extra cost.
0316776963|3.0|I could hardly put the book down as I read the first chapter.  However, I was disappointed as I continued through the book.  I did not find the subsequent chapters as entertaining.  It was a easy read for vacation, but it did not keep me engaged.
B00003CY5K|5.0|Its very difficult to find a good movie anymore where not every other word is not a bad word, or that no one gets killed.  However, this movie pulled it off with flying colors (mostly pink per say :P  )  I give Legally Blond two thumbs up and I encourage anyone to see it.
B00003CY5K|5.0|My most beautiful blonde girlfriend and I went to see this movie ....We laughed practically throughout the whole movie and it helped us unwind and made us feel good, especially on a Friday night after work.  This movie is about putting your mind to what you want to be able to achieve in life, especially if everyone doesn't believe in you and that you know you can do it.  This is an excellent movie that everyone should see.
B000006CCG|5.0|This is a milestone is heavy metal. i love it to death, this is rock and roll at its best, i cant explain what it does to me but just go and buy it!!!!
0345350499|2.0|I got approx. 1/3 of the way through the book and had to put it down. The lies and incest were just a little too much for me. I was also  disheartened by the story which I thought would be one of great women. These women while powerful were victims of the goddess. I did not like this book. Although it was very well written.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is a quite fantastic album, the opener &quot;Five Years&quot; is astouding, and grows &amp; grows on you. From then on theres hits such as &quot;moonage daydream&quot; &amp; the fantastic &quot;Hang on to yourself&quot; (both of which apppeared earlier on The Man Who Sold The World), and by the time you hear the classic &quot;Starman&quot; you know that you are listening to an album that is very special indeed. This is probably the best known &amp; most listened to Bowie album, and although its great I still feel that it doesnt quite stand up to albums like &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; &amp; &quot;Station to Station&quot;
B000002AGY|5.0|I came to jazz in the mid-eighties, and Concierto was my introduction to the jazz guitar of Jim Hall. I didn't stop there--I own everything that is in print that Jim Hall played on--but I keep returning to this masterpiece.<br />This is a recording of jazz voices. Who needs out-and-out lyrics, when you have the magnificent, battle-weary, eloquent instrumental voices of Paul Desmond, Chet Baker and Jim Hall to talk to you? <br />&quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; is the arena for these jazz voices to tell their stories, and what can we do but listen, over and over? I'm not slighting the rest of this CD; the difference between the carefully-structured, slow, intense &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; and the more-mainstream jazz cuts is part of what makes this all work so well. An essential jazz CD.
B00003CXN4|2.0|<br />It's the same arrogance that led to a plethora of dull, uninspired, pretentious 12 minute 'concept' songs in the 1970s that is behind this style of film. <br /> Traffic has everything: a good cast, an engaging plot, an exciting scenario and a message - so it takes a special kind of skill to ruin it in the way that it has been. A skill that is prominent in art-school classes populated by 20-something know-it-all, upper-middle-class talentless fools who seem to believe that the secret of good film-making is a sepia-coloured filter over the lens, and multiplying the run-time by 2. <br /> In short, a great idea badly made.
B000005HLV|5.0|Mayhem has always been establishing standarts in the black metal scene. <br />When De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, the purists complained about the opera-like voice of Atila, said it was weird. Now its considered a masterpiece. I think that even Dead (R.I.P) couldn't sing these songs better than Atilla did. Some say that Dead was the only true Mayhem vocalist. But then again, as Euronymous himself said in an interview soon after Dead suicide, - &quot;I don't care if people die, not even within my own circle. I have no feelings left. He was a great vocalist, but vocalists can always be replaced. What he did was the greatest sacrifice, and Mayhem only gained from it...&quot;<br />Atilla did a great job, the haunting, yet raw and evil vocals send shivers down the spine when listening to certain songs from the album. Euronymous guitar ripps, I dont care if the guy couldn't perform well live (like shown on Live in Lipzieg), the riffing here is tremendous. <br />I can't even recommend best songs out of this CD. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is a unique album, it reached a cult-like, legendary status. Mayhem is the absolute ruler of Norwegian Black Metal scene, along with bands such as Darkthrone, Emperor, Satyricon, etc. <br />Get this, and unleash the darkness within, it's beautiful.
0451167716|5.0|As is usually true of books which have movies based upon them, The Godfather is better in print form, but this surprised me since I would rank The Godfather as one of the best movies ever. This book about the Corleone Family, really defines the mafia genre and has not been equalled in the 32 years since it was written. The character development is phenomenal, the story lines are very well woven together and conceived, and the ethical lessons contained within the text are sometimes complex, but fascinating.  It shocks me how little Coppola had to alter the story or the characters to create his masterpiece and it will be apparent to all who read it, Mario Puzo's Godfather, is a classic in its own right. You will be disappointed when the story is over, because you are so caught up in the lives of the Corleones that you just want to follow them further. I really can not say enough about this book, but I would recommend it to everyone.
B00005LB50|3.0|This seems to be the type of box set where the audience is predetermined. If you're not a Buffalo Springfield fan by now, surely no major radio stations are playing much else besides For What It's Worth to win you over. But if you are someone who's unsure of whether to buy this or not, be forewarned: it's not a real great value. For the full price of a four-disc set, you get about 22 demos, six remixes, and most (but not quite all) of the material on the Springfield's three albums. As for me, I'm a huge Neil fan, so I had to have it regardless, but I was a little annoyed at several things, from the way the sticker on the box describes the fourth disc as a &quot;bonus&quot; disc (I'm paying for it, aren't I?) in which 21 tracks are repeated from the first three discs, to the chintzy single-ply paper inserts in the individual jewel boxes, to the lack of commentary from Neil or anyone else in the band about the tracks in the booklet. You could probably purchase the three Springfield albums for ten or fifteen dollars less than the cost of this box. If you don't need the demos, or if you have one or two of the original albums on disc already, that might be a better way to go.Some of the demos are interesting, and you can hear what later became Country Girl on CSNY's Deja Vu here as Down, Down, Down. But Rhino usually gives you much more bang for your buck. Let the buyer beware.

I could listen this is CD all day long! It gives such inspiration in my writing. I hope for the book to one day be released like the movie was. It's so ironic that I got this CD a few months ago before it was even advertised. A friend in Germany sent it. And the movie, I recieved it before advertised. Better catch up. Cha!<br />A must buy!!!
0060934913|4.0|This book is simply dripping with machismo and foul language. The author explains this by saying that's the way it is in the restaurant business, and I have no reason to think otherwise. I'm not a prude, you understand, but a little less bad language might have made for a higher ranking, in my opinion. In any event, this is a very interesting work to read, and occasionally I would think about the restaurants in which I have eaten (my wife and I have reservations at the CIA in Hyde Park next month)and wonder if I ever want to go into another one after finishing the work. Of course I will, because I do so like good food prepared well, and the author obviously loves his work, and loves to prepare it for others to enjoy. That's what's important, and it shines through on almost every page of the book. There are some excellent tips for restaurant customers to observe, and I definitely intend to follow them in the future. For the tips alone, the book was worth reading.
B000002H6C|4.0|And Justice for all is a great cd. There is one problem with it. There is only one good solid song on it. &quot;One&quot; brings the cd together. The rest of the songs are also great and very artistic.  My fav songs are &quot;blackened&quot;, &quot;...And Justice for all&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, and harvester of sorrow&quot;.
B00003CXA3|5.0|This is a great movie and it's finally going to be released on DVD. People who love movies will love this one. I believe that this, behind The Conversation, is Hackman's best performance. It's filled with great action sequeneces most notibly the car chase under the train. Everything is right about this movie.
0393320928|5.0|The title of this review may sound as a little bit of an overstatement, given Leonardo Da Vinci's stature, but it is a very close way to depict this distinguished North American physicist who, among MANY other things, won the Nobel Prize, worked in Project Manhattan (at Los Alamos lab) and was part of  the team that investigated (and discovered) the cause of the explosion of the Challenger. If this could already be enough to elevate him a lot, you'll discover through this book how his life was constituted by one of the most interesting and rich cultural mosaics one can imagine.<br /> Always struggling to look at things &quot;differently&quot;, Feynman became a very sought-after educator, teaching at the United States most prestigious universities, as well as other schools in places like Brazil.<br /> At the end of the day, Feynman's most important teachings might come as: 'Never take yourself too seriously' (as other reviewers have already commented), 'Always keep an open mind' and 'Focus your efforts on what really matters'.<br /> If you enjoy this book (which I'm sure you will), check out what could be considered the first part of it: 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' : Adventures of a Curious Character; as well as Tuva or Bust!

B00004YKUY|4.0|Those who are skeptical about the new incarnation of Journey should put all their fears to rest:the new Steve(Augeri)does justice behind the mic.'Arrival'is in every way a second reunion for this legendary band,having all the hooks and inspired songwriting they are known for.One of the best AOR albums of the year.
B00004U8P9|5.0|After 25 years of fish-net stockings, sweet transvestites, doing the Time Warp (again, and again, and again...), and TOAST!, Rocky Horror seems to be destined to become as American as apple pie... Being devoured by those infamous red lusty lips of course!<br />Rocky Horror on DVD is fantastic! Extra features such as the audience participation, VH1 Special excerpts, interviews, and footage of Rocky Horror performed live, including extra DVD-ROM features make even more racious fun for the most unconventional of conventionalists! The only problem I found was with the audience participation track which sometimes was a little hard to hear with all the screaming and shouting of lines. <br />Still, the Rocky Horror Experience is NOT COMPLETE until you have seen it done live, which the DVD has tried to recreate with a fair amount of extra features and Frank-N-Furterish fun! Give in to ABSOLUTE PLEASURE, and check out Rocky Horror on DVD!

B000002AGN|5.0|Being born in 1967, my exposure to jazz was limited at best. I knew the names of the greats but was not well versed on the genre. Enter my grandmother, who for her day, was certainly a vanguard in many respects. The album cover always fascinated me and was certainly one of the reasons I became fascinated with Art and subsequently had an art history major.<br />Although I always remembered &quot;Take 5&quot; and liked it, mostly for nostalgia reasons I really was not aware of what other amazing songs were on this CD (in my case). I have always been a little skiddish of Jazz in particular, progressive mostly because I didn't have the capacity, or perhaps the maturity to understand it.<br />Eventually, I decided it was time to give the entire CD a listen and I was completely blown away! I was astounded at the pure talent that all of the musicians posessed (and at times, I think they were possesed, in a good way). There is no way I would be able to select a favorite track on this. It opens with the beautiful &quot;Blue Turk a la Rondo&quot; which starts with a wonderful display of technical skills and continues to flow through the rest of CD much in the same manner. I am not a musician, but it was obvious to me that they were experimenting with times and not using typical 2/4 or 3/4 and while normally I would have had difficulty listening to something other than what is mainstream time, I found that it flowed seamlessly throughout.<br />As I said before, I am not well versed on jazz but I certainly am going to explore other artists based on this CD. If you happen to be like I was, &quot;Jazz Challenged&quot;, try this one on for size, you will be glad you did!
0345442989|2.0|This book focuses on the political antics of the Galactic Senate and the dealings of some if the individual senators.  It focuses on the wheelings and dealings of Senator Palpatine and how he underminds everything in the Senate.  If you want to know about how the Senate falls this is a very good book.  I have not enjoyed the prequel books as much as I have the post-Jedi series.  To me, this book was a little slow and took me a while to read because there was never really a point in which it &quot;grabbed&quot; me and made me want to read more.  I did finish it and would say that you can read it for information but you do not need to read it to understand any of the story.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD, is definitely the best CD ever. It is filled with non stop quality punk action. Not ONE song in here [isn't good]. This CD happens to be the CD that got me into punk. I now own all 6 of Blink182's CDs. that is not referring to Fly Swatter which they don't make anymore. This is definitely Blink182's best CD. So if you are playing that game where you are choosing your first Blink182 CD, choose this one. That is about the CD. Now for my reviews of the individual songs...<br />1. Dumpweed - One of my favourite song. It's fast and hard. It is a great opening song. It automatically tells you what a lot of the cd will be like. That is [complaining] about girls.<br />2. Don't Leave me - Another one of my favourite songs. This song has a slightly similar sound to Dumpweed. But this song is better. The drumming in this song is SPECTACULAR! It shows that the new drummer, Travis, can do great drumming just like Scott could. This is also Mark's favourite. He claims he wrote it and has no clue what the lyrics are about!<br />3. Aliens Exist - Not nearly as good as the 2 opening songs. However, Blink doesn't let you down cause this is another awesome song about aliens that will blow you away.<br />4. Going Away to College - One of the lighter sings on the c.d. However, a great song none the less.<br />5. What's My Age Again - This is the song that all Blink182 fans know and love. This was Blink's first smash hit. I guess you could say it was the song that got them well known.I have yet to figure out why this song sounds so awesome. But somehow it does, and happens to be another one of my VERY favourite songs.<br />6. Dysentery Gary - If you are an easily offended girl, then skip this track cause it can be offensive to girls. But if you aren't then jam on to another great song by Blink182. <br />7. Adam's Song - It is hard to believe that this smash hit was written by blink at all! It sounds VERY different then the rest of the c.d. Not to mention there are MANY better songs on the c.d. However, it is a great song just like every other song on Enema of The State.<br />8. All the Small Things - Probably the lightest song on the c.d. Despite what other people on here are saying I think this is a great song.<br />9. The Party Song - A VERY fast song. Just like Adam's Song this song shows that BLINK182 is capable of doing something completely different...<br />10. Mutt - This is the worst song on the CD and yet still is a good song! It is much slower, mellower and lighter than other Enema of The State Songs. In fact it sounds exactly like something that would have appeared on the Cheshire Cat CD.<br />11. Wendy Clear - This song was probably written around the making of Dude Ranch because this song sounds like it could have easily come off of the Dude Ranch C.D. Dud Ranch BTW is the 2nd best Blink182 CD.<br />12. Anthem - This song is definitely the hardest Blink182 song off of Any Blink182 c.d. It is also another one of my favourite songs. You can just hear the background music overflowing with rich electrical guitar song and is another great song by Blink182.
0930289455|3.0|I have been a Batfan for years and people would give me the same look when they discovered that I did not own &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. After finally purchasing the book, I am overall disappointed. Not because of the mild language, or the shortness, but the lack of a true plot and character development. The Joker remembering his origins was interesting and it was something different seeing the Joker and Batman actually reasoning with each other. If anything, the last 2 pages were worth the 3 stars because I had never seen anything like that in a Batman comic before. Read my review for the &quot;Batman: Aliens&quot; book if you are interested in a well-written Bat-thriller.....
B000056IKS|5.0|One of the most important pieces of Euro-unobtainium for years has been the NEU! albums. These works influenced a host of musicians who've managed to get hold of them in some way or another; from Detroit techno wizards to lo-fi tinkerers, a host of players owe a long-unsung debt to NEU!<br />This first album appeared in the wake of Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother's split from an early lineup of Kraftwerk. It has some of the motoric rhythms + sonic tampering of the early (ie: &quot;Kraftwerk&quot; and &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot;) Kraftwerk releases, but more of an emphasis on rock beats, guitars, and a late-psychedelic sensibility. But lurking under this...especially hinted-at in the liner notes and the noise-romp &quot;Negativland&quot;...is a leaning toward the glorious racket of punk and postpunk outfits such as PiL (whose John Lydon, it should be noted, is a confirmed NEU! fan). But also lurking here and there is a weird ambient-experimental murk that also leans one toward thing such as Eno's work, or later on, that of The Orb.<br />All of the original Brain-released 'canon' NEU! albums are worth having, but either this or the final &quot;NEU! '75&quot; are the right places to start.
B00005LK94|5.0|In &quot;Short Cuts,&quot; Robert Altman suggested, correctly perhaps, that the culture at large is coarse when it comes to caring for the young and innocent.  All the more reason, then, to welcome a film like this one, which champions nature, nurtur(ing), and family--however constructed.  It's the old hero's journey carried out on the fresh wings of a girl.  Fly away home.
B000005RHR|4.0|All the reviewers here say it right -- it's ambient, it's timeless, it's great music! I was looking for modern drum &amp; bass and picked this up at my friend's recommendation -- I had no idea it was so old, even after listening to it! It's very mellow and laid back, alien, and easy to get into. Highly recommend it to trance and dance enthusiasts, but by itself it's not dancing music.
B000003N7G|5.0|This being John Coltrane's &quot;gift to God&quot;, a sound, feel and true spirit runs through this wondrous recording. Picking highlights is pointless, this is THE definitive Classic Coltrane Quartet document. Modern Jazz simply doesn't get any better than this and for my money, this release forever altered the way modern music is percieved. This is a sprawling, cohesive statement that deepens with every listen. Elvin Jones is not simply a drummer, he's a percussive pyrotechnician! Jimmy Garrison stops and starts these pieces with a melodic bottom-end that has rarely been matched and the brilliant McCoy Tyner adds some of the loveliest and most heated piano flourishes of his career giving the album an almost classical feel. 'Trane himself has never sounded better, laying his very soul bare on every cut. After this, everything would change (I think for the better and even more adventurous) but for a brief, shining moment &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; found this restless soul kneeling at the altar offering praise to GOD above. His expression and artistry will haunt you forever, and that's a wonderful feeling.
B0000026UV|5.0|I borrowed my dad's copy, yes it's true -- but the music is so good! This CD introduced me to Chet Atkins and I really love the way he and Knopfler jam together -- they are both masterful on the guitar. They mix slow, soulful ballads with upbeat songs and singing, and the dialogue is catchy and funny. Just listen to the tracks.. if you like 2 and 3, you'll like the rest.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I am so glad that they are giving us the DVD release of the Goonies.  This is and will always be one of my favorites.  If you have never seen this movie, it will become your favorite as well.
B00003CXSM|1.0|I thought I would watch this movie with my wife, who really wanted to see it.  It was horrible.  I was embarrassed for the actors in it.  I had to leave the room; I couldn't finish watching this awful movie!  I would have given it zero stars if I could have.  It's that bad.  Do not waste your time with this movie.  It's terrible.
014028009X|5.0|This book rocks! I could NOT stop laughing...Some things I could relate to, some things I wondered why they didn't happen to me yet. In conclusion, I believe this book to be a work of complete and total genius.
B00003CXN4|2.0|I can think of nothing less interesting than &quot;Traffic.&quot;  I rented the DVD expecting a film meritous of high praise.  Instead, I got a good nap.  I've seen traffic jams that were more interesting.  As a whole, I thought the film was slow, uninspired, and trite.  There was nothing new in this film.  Like we didn't know that suburban white kids are smackheads, or that drug lords try to find legit fronts for their business, or that governments are the real drug trafficers.  I was unimpressed by everything but the performances of Benecio Del Turro and Don Cheadle -- they're the reason I even bothered to give the film any stars at all.  If you'd like to see an interesting drug movie, find &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot;  It didn't win any Oscars (though Ellen Burstyn was nominated and lost to Julia Roberts).  It barely played in any theatres (due to the mpaa's refusal to rate the film). &quot;Requiem&quot; makes &quot;Traffic&quot; look like a Disney movie...or an Oscar winner.  In my opinion, the latter is worse!  If you haven't seen it, steer clear from &quot;Traffic.&quot;
0792844882|5.0|As an avid fan of the wonderfully worthless &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, I thought I had seen the ultimate in the &quot;so bad it's great&quot; filmmaking genre. Then along came &quot;Showgirls&quot;, which showed me just how wrong I was. Glory hallelujah, I have seen the light! Yes, friends, this is the most delightfully deplorable motion picture of all time.<br />As if Joe Eszterhas and Paul Verhoven (who apperantly have some SERIOUS issues with women) hadn't squeezed enough gratuitous nudity and sex in their thoroughly unenjoyable &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, they have topped themselves in one of only two movies ever to get an NC-17 rating (&quot;Crash&quot; is the other one, and it's actually pretty good). This perfectly pathetic film follows the adventures of Nomi Malone, a hot-headed drifter who hitches a ride to Vegas and becomes the biggest thing to hit the sex industry since former president Bill Clinton. Along the way, she'll throw many a hissy fit, befriend an angelic stripper, lock horns with a self-absorbed rival, avenge a brutal rape, and utter some of the worst lines of dialogue ever written for the silver screen. Former &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; star Elizabeth Berkely plays Nomi like John Travolta played Terl; she overacts to the brink of Spontaneous Human Combustion, shouting the horrid dialogue at the top of her lungs, which surprizes me because they are buried under twin Everests of silicone. The other actors don't fare much better, partially because they are acting to the worst script ever, worse even than the plotline to the Carrot Top movie.<br />So why five stars? Because you'll love every minute of it. The film is howlingly hilarious, from the actors to the script to the dialogue. You'll be awestruck by the film's monumental depravity from beginning to end, and because the movie is 131 minutes long, you'll have plenty to savor. So put the popcorn on the stove, invite your closest friends, and enjoy the most deliciously detestable movieever made. It's a guarenteed good time, and remember, this flick cost United Artists 40 million bucks. Oy!
0671024256|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book, but it won't be my last! I read it because it was &quot;on writing,&quot; and King offers excellent, down-to-earth and applicable insights! But the book also contains a fair amount of autobiography that demythologized King for me. Also, if you haven't read it yet, his Vassar commencement speech is definitely worth your time! It is posted on his official homepage (I originally included the URL in this review, but Amazon's editing system blipped it).
0553456504|5.0|Every time I read (or listen to) a Bill Bryson book, I start laughing on page one and don't stop until I put it down.   What sets this one apart is the format - it's a collection of columns instead of his usual full-length book, but he embraces the format, using it to talk about many facets of life in Britain and America.  It's so interesting to hear about our daily American lives from the perspective of a prodigal son, since he both feels familiar and at odds with the culture at the same time.  He misses things we've forgotten existed, and finds things we take for granted new and worth commenting on.  I've never found another book written by someone in similar circumstances.   If you like audio books at all, I highly recommend any Bill Bryson on audio.  He reads everything himself, and it adds many layers of enjoyment.  Not to mention that Iowan-British accent!
0316779237|3.0|Holidays are trying at best, you try to get the shopping done, you try not to gain 10 pounds and you try not to kill your relatives.  <br />David Sedaris has captured the true spririt of the holidays in his collection of short stories &quot;HOLIDAYS ON ICE&quot;.  And no way is Tiny Tim gonna make us feel all warm and sappy.<br />With a sharp tongue and even shaper typewriter, Sedaris tells the tales of being an Elf at Macy's.  Another about how his sister brings home a co-worker who is on a work-release program from prison and the most absurb tale on giving until it hurts, literally.  If you have just been turned on to Sedaris you might be a little dissapointed in this book, but there are a few laughs but all tales are so well written you will be compelled to finish this book in one evening.  <br />For those of you new to Sedaris, you will get a quick look into the sense of humor of one of America's up and coming humorists.
B000002KGT|3.0|second hand news is a typical lindsey compositional songs, but I dont like the drums sound on the tracks. It is too soft and not much effective. but it is accepttable for MAC fans like u all.
0684803356|3.0|I found the book to be a little tiresome to be honest. Although I did really enjoy the final section of Robert Jordan's thoughts on death, I found the rest hard to read at times. The style I thought was dry and bare, too much so for my liking, and the characters (particularly the hero) incapable of much emotion themselves or of summoning emotion in me. His style was &quot;sparse and halting&quot;, as Jack Kerouac said, and this definitely had a bad effect on the book, especially the sections with Maria, which I expected to be brimming with passion and joy. Instead, we just got rather turgid descriptions of &quot;it moving&quot;. Having said that, it improved as the time of the bombing drew near and the tension rose, but personally I found it too dry and arid.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|I posted a review for Rufus' debut album as well.  Initially, all I could do was slam it.  It just seemed to drag on and on with the same monotone din.  I did come to like it, however, and I appreciated Rufus' style more after I realized what a refreshing change it is as opposed to the sickly, commericial, teen-dribble pop that dominates the market.  With &quot;Poses,&quot; however, there was never a question...<br />Rufus' maturity as a songwriter and his greater understanding of melody come shining through here on his sophomore release.  Often, an artist's second release can be a trying time as critics look to nay-say and speculate in light of a debut success.  Rufus, however, has outdone himself and hopefully established his niche in the industry.  I won't go into specific critique of each song--others have already done it.  Just know that if you appreciate good, melodic, easy-to-listen-to tunes with a refreshing dash of creativity, &quot;Poses&quot; is worth your cash.
B00004Z459|1.0|They are better than THE BEATLES AND NIRVANA COMBINED.<br />              Honest.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out, and it is still something I listen to all the time. <br />Some people have said that it is too derivative of his older work. Well, even if that is true in some respects, I would say that doesn't make it bad. Just because it isn't different in style from something he has done before doesn't mean that it isn't just as wonderful, or better, than the first time around.<br />That being said, I don't really think it's all that derivative of his earlier work, personally. <br />It doesn't matter what you call it - or what you think it derives from - what matters is that the songs themselves are amazing, the album is an incredible and cohesive whole, and you just can't beat it... thinking about it now, it may actually be my favorite CD that I have ever heard. Certainly in the top 3, and the other 2 are probably Tom Waits, too.
0061020680|4.0|This novel is really good. Having read the other 3 previous novels, I can say that this is rivals the Light Fantastic in terms of quality and characters. Some of the scenes weren't described so well(ie. I only discovered Mort's age a little bit too late in my opinion) and it's too short, doesn't cover ALL of the things that could've happened with the idea (Which I won't spoil it for you)<br />But other than that, a great Discworld novel, much better than Equal Rites (Which I was disapointed with)
6305095566|5.0|AHHHH!!!!! I first saw this movie when I was 11 (I'm 13 now) and it freaked me out. And I don't get scared easily, mind you. <br />Our premise is there are 5 college kids from Michigan State University who want to celebrate (their graduation? vacation?) and they go off to a cabin in the Tennesse woods. Then they go in the basement and find a reel to reel tape recorder which they play and it awakens these evil spirts that one by one posess the students. I'm not giving away the rest, I had no clue what was gonna happen when I first saw it. This is my alltime favorite movie, and it can be yours too---if you're not too SCARED.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Talk about leaving America on a high note. Soon after the recording session that produced GO, Gordon crossed the Atlantic for more welcoming shores.  This magnificent record kicks off in style as bassist Butch Warren's intro for \\"Cheese Cake\\" opens the door into a room filled with Dexter's horn. It's a place you don't want to leave. The theme is an addictive confection, the pauses full of anticipation, and all the solos, including Sonny Clark's on piano, absolutely steam with cool.  The record has two moving ballads that slow things down at just the right time, but the highlight of the whole session has to be Cole Porter's \\"Love For Sale.\\"  Gordon's version begins with an understated Latin intro. The saxophonist extraordinaire then blows a loving treatment of the irrepressible melody; the big man even manages to insert the Mexican hat dance somewhere along the way.  This is truly jazz as unbridled joy - what more do you need?
6301735048|5.0|I am NOT a staunch Kevin Costner fan... but this movie is simply powerful.  Yes, Tony Scott does go over the top on some of the melodramatics; but that IS the point:  Life is, at times, melodramatic.  The steamy undercurrent of the film culminates in an explosive yet tender ending.  Interestingly enough, this puppy can be disguised as a &quot;chick flick&quot; as well as a &quot;neo-classic.&quot;  Madeline Stowe is exquisite, and Mr. Quinn should have earned at least an Oscar nomination for his role.  The cinematogrophy is stellar, as is the dialogue within the script.  This movie is not so much about violence and sex as it is about frienship, true love, and the costs associated with both.  You will not be dissappointed!  ~JHC
6302648750|1.0|This movie was so awful and so unbeliveable.....can they write something that affects people these days? This movie doesn't even come close to dealing with what's going on in the world today....next time I see a movie with either one of these actresses, I better make sure the critics say something positive about it!.....I will never watch this movie again
B00004Z400|4.0|Deftones are an awesome band i have to admit, but some of their songs are just plain dumb! i really like change (in the house of the flies) now that is a great song.  Deftones have room to improve and i hope they do.  lokking forward to their next album.
B00004WG4G|3.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; offered a lot to us but I think &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was better because it had better acting and it was more suspenseful......&quot;American Beauty&quot; was good, but in my opinion it didn't &quot;shine&quot; like some movies do
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin park(wut a weird name?)sound came across me rite on my face with their one step closer.i started to look out for more after that.Suprisingly...they are young.I admit it i do listen to some of the boyband stuff but LP is definately not a boyband cheesy cake that makes u wanna ... sometimes.This is far more better than Limp bizkit latest album.I love limp bizkit but LP is better.I hate it when fred dust making cheesy sissy kinda voice.Thus LP came on the rite time when i need something fresh,energetic and original.Their first track papercut is one of my fav.I like the rapping part and the video was kewl too.In the end is very special...i put it on when i felt ... off.Plus the piano really suit the opening.I think most of u know crawling..which is one of fav. track aswell.IF ur into rave stuff Cure for the itch gotta be ur fav.(and mine too).All of the songs are very well performed.The music melt in ur blood and ur definately will grin with satisfaction at the end of the track.If ur notice this guy can do harmony backup vocals for example 'in the end'i really like the soothing voices esp at the part \\"it starts with...\\".This album is definately a must buy.
B00000K2SC|1.0|I wonder why I even went to see this movie.....I was told it had a good plot but after watching it for over 2 hrs, all I could see was special effects......I couldn't figure out the plot because this movie was so weird and all it was was visuals and people fighting in fights that I didn't even know what they were fighting about! I couldn't believe I saw this movie....what an utter bore!
B00003CXN3|4.0|...but, unlike the headline above, the rest of the film was actually quite good. Having seen \\"Erin Brockovich,\\" I wasn't looking forward to much, maybe more glorification of some narrow interpretation of justice or a climactic closure.<br />Yet it turned out to look good, and \\"look\\" is a key word, because I think the cinematography was quite original. But if Soderbergh wants to look European and cinema verite, he should have slashed more of that music.<br />Nonetheless, I don't give four stars often, and that only means it's worth a look....
B00005AACC|1.0|I hated The Matrix and I hated this one! Both movies had confusing plots and there was no excitement in either of em..but I'll stick to MI2.....unlike the first one, MI2 drags on a boring love story with boring discussions that lead to nowhere and a plot that one would need a map to follow since it's so hard to figure out....the only good thing about this movie was the ending since that was the only exciting part of the movie.....the rest is all talk and that's not thrilling......the first one had a lot of action but this one had absolutely almost no action which left us to wonder.......Why give someone a mission when it's boring?   Absolute Waste of money! don't see this movie!
6303022901|5.0|Believe it or not, I got a copy of the Joy Luck Club for close to a year and a half, if not more, and only recent decided to unwrap it and watched it. And it is one of the most emotionally, psychologically, and also inspiring films I have seen in years. <br />Took place at a party on the night before the main protanganist, June, was to go over to China to meet her long lost half-sisters, reluctantly abandoned by their mother (one reviewer dare to say the movie have the mother fall asleep and woke up with the children gone, that is NOT what happened), we are introduced to four elderly chinese american women and their respective daughters (of which June is one).<br />As everyone celebrates June going over to China to meet her half sisters,  we also see each mother and daughter pair reckoned over the event, and told in flashback, what tragedies and trumphs they themselves have also face in the past....whether it is being promised at age 4 to be somebody's future bride, having your mother being somebody's &quot;fourth wife&quot;, having your husband bringing home a prostitute right in your face, or desperately trying to save your children only to have to leave them behind and hope for the best.<br />This last story, about the woman who tries to bring her two daughters out of Japanese occupied territory to her husband only having to leave them behind: brace yourself. It is emotionally wrenching and actually brought tears to my eyes. What is even sadder is realization that such a scenario had probably happened in real life. <br />Ultimately, watching this film made me realized how lucky I am living in America (esepcially to all you anti-men feminists out there who think you are being &quot;oppressed&quot;, you ain't seen NOTHING), and that nobody living here now, no matter what your nationality, should ever take this country for granted....and appreciate the sacrifices of our parents, grandparents and forebearers, who took that step and came here so we can have a better life.<br />For that alone, The Joy Luck Club merits my five star rating.
B00004Y635|5.0|I loved Scream 3! It was a great way to end this suspenseful trilogy....I would've never have guessed it would end the way it ended.......the acting was great and it had such a compelling story to it......I would recommend this movies to friends and I'm glad I didn't waste money by seeing it in theaters.....I hope WEs Craven continues to do horror movies like Scream
B000002H97|4.0|This only gets four stars because there are better Metallica albums. As general music goes, this is 5 stars... easily. The Black album is a simpler, stripped down version of Metallica. The guitar solos are shorter, the topics are less apocalyptic and songs do not last 8 minutes any longer. I prefer the earlier stuff, not because its 'thrashier', but because it is more musically complex and the themes are stronger. However, this is vastly superior to their alternative rock albums (Load, Reload) because the songs are still written excellently. 'Enter Sandman', although simple, is one of my favourite songs because its got a great riff and a cool guitar solo by Kirk. Also, this album is heavy enough to act as a transitional album for those wanting to explore the first four Meatllica albums. Buy this, love it, and then get the awesome 'Master of Puppets'.
6304618344|1.0|&quot;Face/Off&quot; was so stupid that I didn't even care what happened to the characters.....if one killed the other that would've been good but if they both committed suicide then that would've been MUCH BETTER......When in society do you take the risk of being someone &quot;else&quot; in order to catch a killer.......the guy was in prison but he wanted to &quot;trade places&quot;       what a stupid plot! This was surely a waste of my money!
0679879269|5.0|I think that The Amber Spyglass had to be one of the best books I've ever read.  Lyra and Will belong right up there with Harry Potter and Ender Wiggin.  If you didn't read the first two books in the trilogy, The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, you might be lost.  Except for the first couple of paragraphs, it is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat, all-stops-out thriller! I highly recommend it, please read it!
B00003CXE6|5.0|I loved &quot;Gladiator&quot;! Everything about it was so good....the acting, the plot, the fight scenes, and the scenery......it was a winner in my mind! I loved the scene where Maximus fights off the lions cus it gave me an idea about what you need to do in order to survive and avenge the deaths of your loved ones....this movie explores the Roman Times and tells us it wasn't easy...This is a movie to remember
0812550757|4.0|Though not as appealing as Ender's Game, it is still a very good book, very suspensful as well.
B000002UR7|3.0|1 = poor, 2 = average, 3 = good, 4 = excellent, 5 = classic 2.5 stars is about right for this album.<br />This record has a special significance for me, as it was with this record I discovered radiohead, and began to get really interested in music. At the time I was listening to very mainstream rock as the Cranberries, Oasis and Alanis Morisette. My older brother had the Bends, but I didn't really get hooked until I saw them at the Roskilde Festival (the second largest rock festival in Europe) in '97, only days after their infamous Glastonbury gig. They blew me away, and after the festival I got hold of Pablo Honey at the library and listened to it pretty much non stop for 3-4 weeks, and this lead me to the Bends and OK Computer, still my two favourite albums.<br />But, when compared to these gigantic records, this record is very average. Track by track review follows:<br />1: You  --  A good opener, nice but after the first 50 listens it begins to bore     ...   2.5/5<br />2: Creep  --  One of the best on the album, nice singing, but the real treat is Johnny's guitars. Originally created to ruin a dull track, the abusive lead guitar in the chorus is really fantastic. This song is so great live, much better than on the record (if for nothing else, then for the intensity, of the crowd) ... 4/5<br />3: How do you?  --  fast rock'n'roll; nothing special, but I really like this one  ... 3/5<br />4: Stop whispering  --  A long dull song; why anybody would make that a single is beyond me, I always skip past this ... 1/5<br />5: Thinking about you  --  My absolute favourite off this cd; relatively simple (Thom with an acoustic guitar), but it's so intense, this shows their only real strength the first couple of years: the heartfelt passion, the way Thom gives every song his all  ... 4.5/5<br />6: Anyone can play guitar  --  another single, this is one of the best tracks on the cd. A straight rock tune   ... 3.5/5<br />7: Ripcord  --  A song on the dangers of signing to a label. Good lyrics (as the rest of the album) compared to most other bands at the time, but it's still wanting when compared to radiohead's later songs. The song is pretty dull  ... 2/5<br />8: Vegetable  --  pretty anonymous song, blends in with the others ... 2.5/5<br />9: Prove yourself  --  I really liked this at first. This song about suicide is RH's first single, but it really isn't very good ... 2/5<br />10: I can't  --  I really like the guitar intro, but the body of the song is quite average ... 2/5<br />11: Lurgee  --  Nice very short acoustic about coming out of a bad relationship. Lurgee is british slang for a nasty infectious disease ... 3/5<br />12: Blow out  --  completely different sound than the rest of the record; almost funky, with a very recognisable bassline, this one is Jonny's favourite Pablo Honey track ... 3.5/5<br />This record has meant something to me, and I still listen to it sometimes. When I listen to it, I feel like I'm being taken back to that part of my life again. I for my part am glad to have been introduced to RH through this record, I think I understand their later work better by listening to it in chronological order, and growing along with them. If you know you're going to get all the CD's, then get this first; If you're not quite sure, then buy the Bends first - it isn't as good as OK Computer, but it is a lot more accessible.<br />I think the level of the ratings on this page is totally inflated; eg. how can you give a rating of 5 stars if you think that: &quot;this is nothing compared to The Bends&quot; or &quot;this cd lacks what sets Radiohead apart&quot;? If you give the highest rating to a product you think is far below the REALLY good stuff, what are you going to give records like 'the Bends' and 'OK Computer'?
B00005LOUR|5.0|It's no wonder that \\"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" ended up being the number one, top-box office money-maker of the year 2000. Jim Carrey IS the Grinch! His portrayal is obviously based on not only the book and the 1966 animated special, but also the other Grinches as seen in Dr. Seuss' \\"Grinch Night\\" and \\"The Grinch Grinches The Cat In The Hat\\" .... His facial expressions and mannerisms are perfect (and approved by Seuss' widow- a real Grinch lover herself)! It&#8217;s amazing to see him do that famous Grinch smile that seems to go on forever! Jim manages to speak clearly and sound like a Grinch, even with those huge prosthetic teeth, (which as he told Rosie O&#8217;Donald, force you to talk as he did in the movie). And to be as flexible as he ever was, even in that suit! In fact, he's actually rather cute! The film is funny both for kids and adults since it has a variety of humor to appeal to all ages. My 7 year old and her 60 year old Grandpa loved it as much as I did and I&#8217;m 33, making this a rare film that can be enjoyed by all generations. The whole production is amazing; sets are right out of a typical Seuss book, like &#8220;The Troubles I Had in Getting To Solla Sollew&#8221; or Whoville as seen in &#8220;Horton Hears a Who&#8221;. Lots of details (like the 1950&#8217;s style refrigerator from the original book), make it all the more spectacular, yet, they still managed to make it feel some how modern, too. Cindy Lou Who is adorable and the new characters work well. The story is fantastic as we finally find out WHY the Grinch hates Christmas. The last part of the movie is right out of the book and cartoon but with a few of it&#8217;s own inflections. And I LOVED the new version of &#8220;You&#8217;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&#8221; much more than I ever loved the version from the animation. Anybody who tells you Ron Howard was off the mark or that Jim wasn&#8217;t good simply doesn&#8217;t know Grinch! I&#8217;m a Grinch fanatic and a Seussfanatic and I can tell you that every bit of this film was researched and designed incredibly well. In &#8220;Horton&#8221;, Whoville was inside of a speck of dust. In this film, it&#8217;s in a snowflake- perfect! I can't wait to finally own this one!
0790736101|3.0|HORROR OF DRACULA is a pretty good version of the vampire legend.  To be honest, I have only seen three versions of Dracula.  They are the original 1931 version, the 1992 version, the novel by Bram Stoker, and HORROR OF DRACULA.  Of these four versions, the latter is definately the best.  It was told in an interesting and graphic style (unlike the novel) it showed most of the action on stage and wasn't afraid to show some blood and sex (wish the 1931 version had this insight) and still kept Dracula as a villain (the main flaw of the 1992 version.)  However, HORROR OF DRACULA is not without its problems.  For one thing, it's a little too short, not allowing enough time for suspense to build.  Second, Christopher Lee isn't given enough dialouge, the King Vampire should be more than just a monster.  Third, there is no deception on Dracula's part.  Harker goes to the castle knowing Dracula is a vampire, but Dracula doesn't.  When Van Helsing reveals a vampire is behind the strange events, he can already pinpoint who the vampire is.  Dracula, in this movie, has lost his power to deceive and manipulate, resorting to elusiveness instead.  It's still a good movie, there are plenty of heart stopping scenes, like when Dracula finishes drinking Lucy's blood, when Harker becomes a vampire, and the clash of the titans when Van Helsing combats Dracula.  So, while this is a good Dracula movie, I feel better could be done if I had my way.
B000001FI7|5.0|this album is excellent. the music is smooth, the vocals are awsome, and the sound all together is very mellow. i listen to it when i'm in rush hour traffic, to fight the road rage off. if you like trip hop with amazing female vocals, go for this.
B00004Y87O|4.0|Look, for $12-$15 you get a perfectly adequate DVD transfer that looks very clear and boasts good DVD quality sound to boot, for it's age.  I have no real complaints, considering the price, about the DVD itself.<br />For the average DVD owner/watcher Carpenter's &quot;Escape From New York&quot; is a classic dark, sci-fi action adventure story starring Kurt Russell before he went soft, co-starring in bad Goldie Hawn movies.<br />Besides some of the cheesiness which is obvious, (&quot;Snake&quot; is Russell's character name) the story is very compelling and the suspense is believeable and effective.<br />The dark, corrupt, sinister overtone of the film is delivered brilliantly for it's time, and on a grand scale involving Manhattan Island and a post-apocalyptic New York City.<br />For half the price of most DVD's, this one is worth buying and watching more than once.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|Manu is back years after Clandestino, the record that launched Manus career as an individual after Mano Negra. Still with some of the original members of the French-world band Manu brings us the tropical-multi language music that made him diferent from all the \\"latin bombs\\", this time we find a more happy Manu with more reggea and latin rythms instead of the melacholic tunes we found in clandstino, this could be the only change Manu suffered the last years, since this album could be 6 months separate from clandesino and still sound the same, don mistake me, I love Manu and is in my 5 top singers but I waited years and years to hear from Manu again and he shows up with exactly the same sound (even remakes of old songs!!)... after a GREAT concert in Mexico Citys downtown I expected some live track or a little more experimentation, but Manu instead had fun maing more revolutionary music but stepping away from evolution....... still by far GREAT latin music, far from thos ... Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and rest of .......
0060278234|4.0|first of all, don't mess with harry potter. he's FINE. this is different. a whole different world, stuffed with more creativity than most people i know could shake a stick at. lirael is a very good character, but aren't there enough of those people-who-don't-fit-in books? the main characters are very inept at what they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing...you will understand at the end. this book is good, really, don't get me wrong. i love mogget and the Disreputable Dog. the first third was really great, but...the Dead are REALLY creepy! sure, that is the whole POINT of these books, i just...eww. the bells facinate me, though. if nix didn't have such and exellent knack for description the Dead probably wouldn't bother me so much. i liked the stilken so much better! original, and i was scared nearly past the First Gate when lirael was running away. oh, no one uses the bells enough! the same thing in sabriel.  sorry, i'm whining too much, THIS BOOK IS GOOD. and sameth is annoying. &quot;oh, i can't touch the book. it's too scary. how will i ever tell mum that i can't do her job? even though she needs her healing and sleep, can't see find out that her son can't be the abhorsen???&quot; mogget set him straight. the charter magic really interested me too. as mean as i have been, really, this book is good. really. its good. read it. be scared of the Dead. build a house on an island. you'll feel better.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex And The City and HBO are the only reasons I keep that too-expensive premium cable package. Sex And The City makes it worth it. I only started watching this funny and strike-a-chord series this summer and don't know why I waited so long. Fortunately, you can catch up instantly on the first season and second seasons on video/DVD. Each season has 12-18 episodes, and they're like an amazing batch of chocolate chip cookies. You will not be able to stop and you will not be bored, even if you go through the entire season in one sitting. It left me wanting more. The characters' through-it-all friendship will have you appreciating your own tried and true friends. Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha are all likable, real, complex, funny and a pleasure to spend one or eighteen episodes with. If you've been a single woman for more than six seconds, you'll also appreciate the bewildering and recognizable behavior of the men in these friends' lives. New York City as the vibrant backdrop makes the show even more watchable. Interestingly, a male writer wrote several of the episodes, so clearly, there are some good ones out there. And guys, I know several men who are surreptitiously hooked, also ... for any men out there who'd like to know what women think and talk about when they're on their own ... here are all our secrets spilled. I recommend this great series to everyone.
B00004TBWR|5.0|CCR is one of my all-time favorite bands.  But I never bought more than one CCR album on CD.  Why?  Because the Fantasy discs sounded like total garbage.  Rotten sound.  But these K2 remasters from 2000 really do deliver the sound.  It's like discovering the music all over again.  Pure roots rock, no jamming, no show-boating, just raw playing talent and great songwriting.  You know the music if you've ever turned on a radio.  Now, listen to them the way you should have all along.  A fantastic remaster, fully worth the money.  Highly recommended.  If you have the old Fantasy discs, sell them and buy this series.  Seriously.

B00005ASOI|4.0|Originally, I gave this DVD a 2 star rating because I thought it was a fox video release. I was wrong. This DVD is released by ANCHOR BAY, but it's just the movie and some music videos. If you're a real fan of the movie, buy the special limited edition from ANCHOR BAY, which is being released at the same time. The special edition of SUSPIRIA will have 3-disks containing a documentary on the 25th anniversary of the movie plus the CD SOUNDTRACK as well. Well worth the money.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Ben Hur, Spartacus, even the ever tantilizing Roma...no other film of the Roman Epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is one of the few leading men who truely fits the Strong Silent role perfectly, while horribly tradgic, the movie astounds me every time I watch it. You will need to nuke 2 or 3 bags of popcorn prior to the movie, you will be too captivated to get up for food let alone to pause the film.
0062502174|5.0|\\"My heart if afraid that it will have to suffer,\\" the boy [Santiago] confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night.  \\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself,\\" the alchemist replies. \\"And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\\"<br />Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy has had the same dream two nights in a row, about a girl telling him that there is a treasure waiting for him by the pyramids of Egypt. He seeks advice with a fortuneteller and she gives him the advice to go to where his dream urge him to go. Later he meets an old, strange man whom says he is the King of Salem. The old man can read Santiago's thoughts, and he also recommends the boy to leave his safe life as a shepherd and rather follow his dream.<br />This is the start of a long journey of transformation and discovery. The boy doesn't have an easy time while he follows this heart, he is constantly being tested, but at the same time he has the joy of knowing his life is well spent while following his heart and living his history. To no surprise he does achieve his dream in the end. The surprise is how it happens.<br />\\"The alchemist\\" presents a simple fable, based on simple truths with extremely powerful messages. It is a book about finding your path in life and to have the courage to follow your dream, and to understand the signs as you journey through life. What you will notice while reading this book is that very little of what's presented is new to any of us, but then again, that is not the point of a fable either. The author simply reminds us of the things that we already know. Follow your dream, and live your history!<br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a short book (&lt;150 pages), and you'll finish it in a setting or two. It is probably one of the cutest books I have read, along with Steinbeck's \\"Of mice and men\\".<br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a book we all should read once every year.e Alchemist\\" is a book we all should read once every year.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Marvel...well really...marvel at the quality of production and captivating plot, but wonder if they plan a followup. To much was left unsaid, to much we wish to see. A brilliant foundation, just as any ISSUE #1 Comic book, to a formidable world of expansion possible. We've defeated the top bad guy, but I know they can come up with more. So the quesiton is when will XMen 2 come out?
0345442989|3.0|I went in to this book looking forward to an interesting political thriller in the Star Wars Universe.  It was a different look at the saga with some newer (or is that older?) characters. I enjoyed all the political maneuvering, plots and counterplots in this book.  As it turns out, Palpatine was my favorite character in the whole book.  I wish I could say the same for the treatment of the Jedi. To me, all the action centering around the Jedi wasn't up to snuff.  Qui-Gon (as Ahab) chasing his white whale (Captain Cohl) just didn't seem to ring true with me.  All the parts when (and after) the Jedi were on the island (the name of the planet escapes me right now) weren't written with excitement in mind.  Although, I will say that I am wondering where James Luceno is going with his recurring character of the Fosh, Vergere. If they want to try something different with Star Wars, how about they get Tom Clancy to write a  political thriller and Stephen King to write a tale of the Dark Side...
B00003CWL6|5.0|Few films have that cult genre, mystic philosophic appeal, world-class acting, tantilizing music, and overall top notch production qualities all rolled into one. American beauty brings fringe movie making thought to the main screen. One of the few movies I can watch more than once (this and Starship Troopers).
B00004TH6O|5.0|Joshua Homme, x-kyuss member and genius, formed a band which created a really unique sound. Their first self-titled Album was very good, but you could hear the sound of Kyuss (at least a little bit). But now, with (rated) R, Joshua and Nick have made it. A new type of rock. I'll try to rate each song:<br />Feel The Good Hit Of Summer - 9/10 &quot;very cool song, heavy stuff and with good lyrics ;) and i love the video&quot;<br />The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret - 10/10 &quot;the first song i've heard of the album, i'm really into it, with a incredible video. The sound is very good!!! i think everybody loves it&quot;<br />Leg Of Lamb - 9/10 &quot;again a very good song, easy stuff, listen to it and you wanna get stoned&quot;<br />Auto Pilot - 10/10 &quot;a very great song, one of the best of (rated) R&quot;<br />Better Living Through Chemistry - 10/10 &quot;this stands out - you have to listen to know how it is to be in another world...in the world of Joshua Homme&quot;<br />Monster In the Parasol - 7/10 &quot;the latest singel, funny video, good song, but i got bored after listening to the cd over and over...but its good&quot;<br />Quick And To The Pointless - 7/10 &quot;again a funny song i think, its hard stuff, but its very short&quot;<br />In The Fade - 10/10 &quot;i really love this song. i've been listening to it now over a year, nearly every day, and i still love it. It's so great, so f#ckin' good! you need to listen&quot;<br />Tension Head - 9/10 &quot;heavy stuff again, but very very cool. you'll love it&quot;<br />Lightning Song - 9/10 &quot;instumental song, sounds very good - nice to chill&quot;<br />I Think I Lost My Headache - 11 points &quot;this song is really the one, that will blow your head. it last for over 8 minutes. first there are only guitars, then, like in every good rock song, all instrumenst blow you away. After about 4 minutes, the &quot;normal song&quot; is over. no lyrics anymore, but there are trompet and horns for the last 3 minutes.It's so great, sh*t, this song is the best i've heard in the last 3 years (okay, the new tool album stands for its own).<br />overall 100/110 YOU MUST BUY THIS AND TRY TO SEE THEM LIVE, OR YOU'LL NEVER MEET GOD!
B000002OCP|2.0|I like Muddy Waters a lot. I like the rock music of the late 60s a lot. This is a combination of the two, and I can only ask &quot;What were they thinking&quot;? This combination just doesn't work. I may be a little generous in giving this 2 stars. If you're looking for something by Muddy Waters, I suggest &quot;Live at Mr. Kellys&quot; or the Chess Box (or probably ANY OTHER Muddy Waters recording). I don't have the CD, only my old LP. I've only played it about twice.
B00004TX5F|5.0|and the memory of it still lingers in my mind in a way thats hard for me to explain to myself much less another. After reading everyone else review I better understand that sense of wonder at the whole concept. Why a castrato? A man has much stronger and larger lungs than a female and can project a note with much more force. Think of your favorate female singer with  more power. A must see!
B00000IAU3|2.0|please drop the trip hop comparison; the mere suggestion of it would have been insulting to people like massive attack and portishead.  quite soothing most of the time, dido sings quietly with a hint of lethargy. this collection of pretty and laid back songs are inoffensive, if not prosaic.  her singing works wonderfully on the faithless cds though.  check out 'sunday 8pm' and the new 'outrospective' by faithless.  dido works well in the context of a group and clearly she is a team player.
B000002JSJ|5.0|The opening track &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot; really kicked Heavy Metal music into the next decade. Before there was such thrash bands as Metallica, there was &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot;. Even the group Heart ripped off the repeated drum pattern from this song on thier single &quot;Barracuda&quot;. Led Zeppelin, on the other hand, are far superior to thier pale imitators Heart and Metallica(two bands I really hate)put together. Although heavy metal is not my favorite kind of music, Led ZEppelin is one of my favorite bands of all time because for whatever music they played, they played it with plenty of style and class. 'Presence' is proof of the above-mentioned attributes from beginning to end, especially considering the fact that &quot;Tea for One&quot; is one of the most romantic blues numbers ever written.
B00003CY5H|4.0|&quot;The Score&quot; is a near excellent heist thriller with excellent acting by both the Robert De Niro, and Ed Norton.  This is just a straight forward well examined heist film that is really made by the genuine and intriguing performances by De Niro and his younger counterpart Norton.  Marlon Brando was def a weak link to this film, as all he really seemed to do was gasp for air with every breath he took and word he spoke.  I also believe the romantic involvement between De Niro and Angela Bassett could have been developed a little more, as it kinda turned out to be a big part of the story.  Other than that, this is a great film with a great ending!
0425180638|5.0|As a mystery author with my first book in its initial release, I have been an admirer of Patricia Cornwell for years.  Kay Scarpetta is a marvelous creation, and in this novel, Kay struggles to resolve numerous unresolved issues.  Her therapist puts it that way, as will the typical reader.  THE LAST PRECINCT grows directly out of the events of Ms. Cornwell's most recent novels.  This book has everything the Cornwell fan has grown to expect from Kay and the series.  All the usual characters are on hand, even a certain deceased man, in a certain way.  The plot twists and turns, and THE LAST PRECINCT is a winner.
B000002C25|4.0|I find this to be one of Oasis's most underrated albums. People expected way too much after being exposed to their previous album which blew everyone away. Yet I see this to be just as good as &quot;What's the Story Morning Glory&quot;. My favourite songs in &quot;Be Here Now&quot; are &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; And Fade In-Out&quot;. These are some of their finest works in my opinion. Other good songs include &quot;D'You Know What I mean?&quot;, &quot;All Around the World&quot;(could be shortened), &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&quot;. A solid album.
6303212379|4.0|&quot;The Goonies&quot; is an entertaining movie that the whole family can watch together. It starts with a close-knit band of friends spending a last morning together. Their neighborhood is about to be demolished, scattering the families that inhabit it. When they discover an old pirate map, though, they decide to follow it in hopes of finding treasure and saving their homes. What follows is a fast-paced adventure with caverns, crooks, skeletons, booby-traps, and a old pirate ship. There is also a liberal sprinkling of funny lines to go with all the thrills and chills.<br />While this is a fine movie, and great fun to watch, it is not a long-lost Hollywood classic. It doesn't have the action of the Errol Flynn version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, the drama of Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot;, or the classic humor of &quot;Arsenic And Old Lace&quot;. All the five-star ratings here would suggest that this is a movie of classic proportions. It isn't. It's great fun, and I recommend it for family viewing. There's never a dull moment, and I believe most people will enjoy it. I do. I own a copy, already. Just don't expect too much.
B000002BBY|4.0|This is a great Oasis album. It can easily bee seen as one of their finest works and accomplishments. Songs that really stood out for me include &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; and &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;. A great buy!
0385006896|5.0|I remember my first encounter with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. It was just after my fifteenth birthday and I had gotten some money. I was trailing my mother through a department store, and was bored to tears, when I ran across a rack of paperback books (it was the early 1960's and there weren't bookstores all over the place, then). I'd heard of Sherlock Holmes and I'd heard of &quot;The Hound Of The Baskervilles&quot;, but didn't know anything about either. I picked up a copy of &quot;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and was intrigued, so I also grabbed a copy of &quot;The Hound...&quot; and used a bit of my birthday money to buy them both. I started reading &quot;The Hound...&quot; in the car on the way home, and kept reading after we arrived. In fact, I couldn't put it down. I finished it before I went to sleep that night. It was the beginning of a long and satisfying acquintance. Now, all of Sir Arthur's original Holmes stories can be had right here in one complete volume. Whether you're a mystery lover, or you just like a good story, it doesn't get any better than this. What more could you ask for. I have a copy, and it's given me many hours of great reading. I think most other people will enjoy it, too. I recommend it most highly.
B000002AS3|1.0|This has to be their most overrated album. &quot;Live Forever&quot; however is a song that must not be ignored. It is probably one of Oasis's best songs to date. &quot;Slide Away&quot; and &quot;Married with Children&quot; are decent but are far from amazing. I suggest to just buy the single.
6304711875|2.0|This movie is so incredibly bad, it's hilarious.  Anyone scared by this movie should go out and see a real horror movie like the original Psycho.  But this movie's so funny it earns 2 stars.  We've got the principal who keeps scaring himself in his office before he is killed, we have the stupid blonde bimbo w/ the fake... being stupid enough NOT to run away from the masked man in black, and overall all of the poeple who die in this movie are pretty idiotic.  How much of it is a good idea to chat with a guy who's asking you about scary movies, honestly?  And let's not forget how idiotic we are to get back with the guy arrested for being caught with the cell-phone.  This movie sucks as a movie, great camp value.
0062502182|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. I feel tongue tied in trying to describe how wonderful this book is - I can say it is a MUST read for everyone! <br />I have bought copies or loaned out mine to all of my friends and family and they are doing the same after they read it.
B000002UAR|5.0|Now that Mr. Harrison has publically acknowledged the twilight of his life, and the quick dim of a bright candle fore-known as &quot;George, the quiet Beatle&quot;, let us not consume with pain, but rather celebrate his life, his wit, and his perceptiveness. A tax on all, especially ofcourse he, I'm reminded of the Bard, &quot;The fault lies not with the stars above. The fault lies within us all&quot;.  WE LOVE YOU GEORGE, AND HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN WITH OUR SWEET LORD.

B00005B36H|3.0|Evidently the metal darlings have been listening to some Moroccan stuff recently. They dilute it and throw it in here. The drummer still can't finish his fills and has very stiff hands. Typical metal in your face bass line and truly lousy lyrics. Better than most in this genre but nothing really interesting.

B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID NOT WATCH THE DVD FEATURES, the story is the THREE STOOGES on HOMER'S ODYSSEY. It has nothing to do with yellow brick roads and wizards of oz and all that CRUD. Even though the Cohen Brothers never read the story, obviously some reviewers have not either, because if you had, you would know that it follows The Odyssey almost to a tee. In Cyclops' first scene in the book, he kills one of Ulysis' friends (squishing the frog they thought was their friend). And in their second encounter with the Cyclops they defeated him and his village of other Cyclopses (The KKK) and saved their friends who were captured the first time (in the book of course, Tommy wasnt there the first time they met Cyclops in the movie. Then there are the girls at the river they MOST OBVIOUSLY AS HECK REFERED TO AS SIRENS. In the book the sirens lewered the men from a boat and got some of them killed. There are also dozens of other mythological figures that come into play, but none of them turn out to be from Munchkin Land. All in all it was an awesome movie with wonderful music, I even bought the soundtrack today. George Clooney is a riot and the rest of the cast makes this movie worth while.
1878424114|5.0|The seven laws of writing success. Write about something trendy. Write with vague yet understandable words. Know what you are talking about. Make it a page turner. Spell your words right (I know I can't). Write with your heart. Touch the readers soul. While I can not confirm the accurate spelling, Chopra fulfils all of theese requirements. An introduction to laws that in one way or another play a role in most of the eastern religions, Deepak helps the reader understand theese principals without placing the stigma of whole religeons within the pages. Religeon or no religeon, theese laws are universal and expressed in a refreshingly simple and poetic way. Five Stars
B00001ODHJ|5.0|Confused by all the Army of Darkness DVD releases (some in print, some out of print, some lingering halfway between)?  I know I was.  But I've done some research and figured it out, and here's how it breaks down:    1. The original DVD release-- was the original theatrical version of the movie with few extras.  Good picture, good sound, S-Mart ending.  If you just want to watch the best available version of the movie, you might get this one (if you can still find it; it's out of print now).  It also has the familiar movie poster cover with an overly muscled Bruce and the hokey \\"Low on gas\\" slogan.    2. The director's cut-- with the silly Molly Hatchet cover and the original ending.  There are many minuses: key lines are changed (not necessarily for the better).  Much of the footage looks really horrible, including the entire concluding battle.  All the deleted scenes have the feel of an eBay-purchased bootleg.  Bottom line: AOD fans will like to see the material, but this is hardly the movie's best presentation.  It's still circulating but they're not making any more of them.    3. The special edition-- probably the best DVD release of the movie to date.  The 2 disc version (which, like the director's cut, is nearing the end of its availability) is great.  It features both the watchable theatrical version and the borderline-unwatchable director's cut.  It has commentary, unlike every other release, although the commentary is only available when viewing the director's cut.  It has a making-of featurette.      The single disc version (now the primary version of AOD available) is only a slight downgrade; basically, it's the theatrical release, lookin' and soundin' fine, with the original ending as an extra, and the making of featurette also included.  (The commentary is sadly missing.)    In summary: You can't go wrong with the single disc special edition or the even better double disc special edition.  Avoid the director's cut unless you already own the original DVDand just want to see all the new footage in all its grainy glory.  The original DVD is a fine purchase if you just wanna watch the movie, already.    2009 edit: to clear up some confusion in comments on this review, I wrote this eight long years ago.  \\"Army\\" probably has five new DVD editions since then, and I'm sorry to report that I don't care enough to keep buying and comparing them.  My experience so far has been that they keep releasing new versions with little regard for what people really want.  In my eyes, a definitive version would be:    1. The main feature would be the theatrical version, fully restored and anamorphic.    2. Deleted scenes and the alternate ending would be cleaned up and well-presented as extras - I know this is possible because I own an Australian DVD of the movie that has them looking a lot cleaner than I've seen on all the older American versions.  It would be also great if they had a menu option to watch the theatrical cut with some of the deleted scenes added back in - in particular the longer (and more cohesive) windmill battle with the mini-Bruces should never have been trimmed down; I'd love to see that in full as part of the movie.  There's a cut that plays on some TV channel (AMC maybe?) that includes this scene, but unfortunately other parts are changed to their detriment - not a great trade-off.  I think most fans of the movie prefer the original version of the movie - the S-mart ending, the original one-liners, etc. - but don't mind seeing some additional scenes thrown in.    3. Commentary, making-of featurette, etc. all included.  The track record of this stuff on previous releases has been very spotty.    4. And finally do it right - put this version (probably a 2 DVD set) in print and get rid of the other ones, and KEEP it in print.  Fans are tired of re-buying this movie just to find out that it's the same damn thing with a line or scene changed... if that.  Let's tie a neat bow on this thing and be done with it.  I'm asbig a fan as they come and I stopped buying the new DVDs a couple versions ago.    2011 edit: Go to this page for a detailed look at all the notable Army DVD editions, including the ones I have not covered (be they Boomstick, Screwhead, or whatever else Anchor Bay/MGM/whoever has decided to foist upon this movie's beleaguered fanbase): [...]
B000056K04|3.0|I thought that this album wasn't the real Dave Mathews.  I recently got the unrelease album The Lillywhite sessions and I absolutly think that that one should have been released instead.  Everyday isn't what I would have hoped it would be.  I think that since it's Dave I will give it 3 stars just because I love that band but I don't like the modern twist to it so I will hold back the other 2.  Sorry to those who Loved it but you should really get The Lillywhite sessions.
B000002GKT|5.0|\\"Rockin' the Fillmore\\" is a perfect statement marking the transition between the 60's and 70's.  Lots of loose jointed jamming for the [...], and the pre-cursor to 70's fist pumping arena rock, \\"I Don't Need No Doctor,\\" featuring Peter Frampton, the original arena rocker.  Still a great album and Humble Pie's best effort.  Too bad Steve Marriott and Peter Frampton never got back together.
B00005ASOC|5.0|of mentoring.  More than teaching, a mentor relationship is one in which both parties learn from each other, and each is sustained and made stronger by their bond with the other.<br />No doubt, you think the veteran Sean Connery can portray this.  Long a leading man, recently a character actor, Connery, however you may like or dislike him as a star, is a consummate actor.  Rob Brown is a revelation; a 16 year old non-actor who has the utmost confidence in himself, and portrays it on the screen, both as his character, Jamal, and as a true partner to Connery in their shared scenes. It will be a shame if the industry does not find more roles for a youngster with such raw talent and screen presence.<br /> A quiet film that embraces both sport and literature, and brings to life many elements of the city of New York (although mostly filmed in Toronto!), FF will touch your mind and your heart.<br />Many reviewers have compared it to &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, but it perhaps is ahead of them (Gus Van Sant  using hindsight?) in that there is so much texture to the simple life of Jamal before he encounters William Forrester, in his friendships, his family, his incredible thirst for knowledge through reading and writing, his love of hoops.  One feels that Jamal would have succeeded on almost any level without Forrester, and is only enriched by his encounter.  For Forrester however, it is life, rediscovered.<br />A terrific cast, a fitting score and camerawork, with perhaps not enough special features to make it a top-drawer DVD, Finding Forrester is high on my short list of favorites for the year 2000.  A gem that will keep coming back into your mind, long after you have seen it.  See it.
B000005ITX|5.0|Okay, everybody who was anybody had a big album in 1967. This album has accoustic guitar, strings and horns(against the band's wishes but a great idea!), really tight bass and drums, gritty lead guitar, way-out songs which break the rules of format but sound good anyway! Arthur Lee's colorful lyrics make you think...you might not know what he's trying to say, but it doesn't matter as it gives the listener his own interpretations. The drums and bass accent almost every line of the melodies. Think about everything you've already listened to to get this review...had enough mainstream but don't like to listen to garage-quality [crud]? Yes, its time for the next step in listening, every song is good, buy this immediately, its a complete masterpiece and the best thing this group ever did, forget any greatest hits collection, this is it!
B00004TL21|5.0|Honestly, if you aren't into some of the slower styles of rock, don't even consider purchasing this album.  It is, when you first listen to it, a very complicated thing.  But it grows on you.  It is currently my favorite album.  It reminds me somewhat of Mer De Noms by A Perfect Circle, another of my favorites, in that it changes tempo and covers some of the deeper emotions of a human, unlike most rock, which is anger, alienation, and depression.  Only purchase if you have a very open mind.
0517122707|5.0|One of the funniest books ever written!  After reading it, you'll understand when people refer to the &quot;Ignatius Filing System,&quot; as well as many other things.  The book's only weakness is its abrupt ending, like Toole got tired of writing and just stopped. If you haven't read it, you should!
B00005JIZA|5.0|This guy is going to be huge.  It is safe to say he is my self appointed advocate for anyone who remembers what it is like to be a teenager.  He is extremely poetic and on top of that he is an amazing guitar player.  YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD.  There are lessons to be learned from his mellow words.  This is the type of cd that you can listen to the whole way through, but my fave tracks are, My Stupid Mouth, Your Body Is A Wonderland, Back to You, and Neon.  You should buy this cd just for the advice this guy gives. However, what makes it my favorite cd in a while is the fact that is so ear pleasing.  This guy has a voice that has the same affect on me as diving into a swimming pool on a hot day.  He just hits u with refreshing thoughts that will just leave you in awe and you will be forced to think about what he's got to say - Cause its all smart and all right.   Just by his cd- You won't regret it.
185984054X|5.0|While many attack this book, the attacks usually just prove one of Hitchens' points;  that many people have a knee-jerk reaction to Mother Teresa, considering her beyond all criticism, while not really knowing anything about her.<br />One of his themes is that Teresa is not primarily concerned with helping people.  She is more concerned with glorifying God (or the church) than loving mankind,  and has a regrettable tendency to put the glory of God ahead of the comfort (or even the lives) of the people she tended.<br />Hitchens also asks what real benefit to the poor Teresa produced, especially considering the huge amounts of money that flow in from around the world.  Often, the 'care' seems to be little more than being given a cot and allowed to die, even if simple treatment could save their life.<br />And while it's been pointed out that there's nothing wrong with taking money from evil people and using it to do good, this misses the point.  When Teresa accepts money from someone like Keating, she isn't taking money from an evil man, she is taking it from all those who Keating stole it from.  She is, in other words, stealing from the poor to give to the poor.<br />Ultimately, one's opinion of Mother Teresa will probably be determinied by one's priorities.  If you consider the glorification of God to be most important, then you will probably not have a problem with the building of churches instead of schools and hospitals.  If you consider the next life to be more important than this one, you probably won't be bothered by the philosophy that it is better to love the poor than to feed them, better to love the dying than to cure them.  And if you believe that God's will is to be trusted over all, then you probably don't mind the encouragement of reproduction in lands where millions already starve.  To each his own.
B00005LB50|4.0|In the scant two years of their existence The Buffalo Springfield managed to establish themselves as one of America's finest rock bands ever; in the 60s only the Byrds, Velvet Underground and Jefferson Airplane were more important.  The three albums which comprise their recorded legacy are all superb, although the latter two (&quot;Again&quot; and &quot;Last Time Around&quot;) were recorded in fractured, White Album- like conditions.  The band also left behind a host of unreleased demos and outtakes--nearly as many as their released tracks--which remained in the vaults for over thirty years, until the release of this long-delayed box set. Showing up here in stunningly clear sound quality, these cuts are as just as good and provide a revelatory glimpse into a missing chapter of rock history.  Of prime importance are the early '67 tracks which comprised &quot;Stampede&quot;, the group's unreleased projected second album which was later refashioned into &quot;Again&quot; at the end of the year: tracks like &quot;We'll See&quot;, &quot;My Kind Of Love&quot;, &quot;Down To The Wire&quot; and the excellent Stills demos &quot;So You've Got A Lover and &quot;My Angel&quot; all would've contributed to a work nearly as good as what eventually surfaced.  Young's solo demos of &quot;One More Sign&quot;, &quot;Round And Round And Round&quot; and an early &quot;Old Laughing Lady&quot; are also top-drawer efforts which would've worked well within the group format; it is clear that with so much songwriting talent within the band, many gems fell by the wayside.  Although there is no live material (apparently no quality recordings have surfaced), there is plenty here for any Springfield fan to drool over.<br />The box itself thus represents an almost-complete chronology of their studio career, with detailed recording information given in the booklet liner notes along with many photos, old press clippings and a listing of every live performance.  However, there are a few inexplicable omissions including &quot;The Hour Of Not Quite Rain&quot;, &quot;Carefree Country Day&quot;, the released versions of &quot;On The Way Home&quot; and &quot;Four Days Gone&quot; as well as the version of &quot;Down To The Wire&quot; with Young's lead vocal which was included on his &quot;Decade&quot;.  Perhaps the most dire omission is the nine-minute version of &quot;Bluebird&quot;, which the group professes to disown but is nonetheless one of the few studio examples of their live extended jamming style, and the only one of the six omitted tracks still not available on CD.  The omissions are all the more inexplicable because there is enough room left on the first three discs to include all of them.  Also, the fourth disc which reprises the first and second albums in their original running order, has been justly criticized as a tad superfluous considering that every track but one (the stereo &quot;Mr.Soul&quot;) is found on the first three discs; at the very least the set could've been sold at a special bargain price, or the stereo mix of the first album's songs included somewhere to avoid the sense of redundancy.  In spite of these nagging foibles, however, the set is still an absolute must and in listening to it, my love for the group has been rekindled tenfold...one blast of the sonically-enhanced &quot;Bluebird&quot; should have you ecstatically air-guitaring all of its intricate parts in no time.le omissions including &quot;The Hour Of Not Quite Rain&quot;, &quot;Carefree Country Day&quot;, the released versions of &quot;On The Way Home&quot; and &quot;Four Days Gone&quot; as well as the version of &quot;Down To The Wire&quot; with Young's lead vocal which was included on his &quot;Decade&quot;.

6303823351|5.0|The Beatles' second film is great fun in a much different way than A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was like a day in the life of the Beatles, which looked like it had a lot of inspiration from the classic era of silent comedies. Director Richard Lester this time gives us a great spy spoof at the beginning of the James Bond-Spy phenomenon that was just starting to take off at that time. We went from black &amp; white to vibrant color in just one year. I think this is what is really interesting if you see the two films together. Both films are like night and day. Essentially we still have two films about the Beatles and the comic episodes they get in and out of but they are both filmed entirely different from each other. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is dryer and a more sophisticated looking film, which contains so many indelible images. The fun film HELP! is a wild and insane comedy-adventure with its own brand of sophistication and is truly a product of its time. These two films were released just one year apart yet they look years apart. These films are great masterpieces and are a record of just how fast life and styles changed in the decade of the 60s. I really like this film. HELP! has that great macroscopic globe trotting feel and look to it. HELP! still gives the viewer that feeling of movement that was so prevalent back then. Things were on the move and really happening. They were just great times.
B000002MUQ|5.0|The more I listen, the more I love this album.  This is one of my top 5 rock albums.
B0000029DD|5.0|Get this CD.  A friend of mine introduced me to Jeff Buckley's music with the beautiful &quot;Lover, You Should've Come Over.&quot;  Without delay, I purchased &quot;Grace&quot; and there's no way I will regret it.  I can't really label his music into any category...folk, jazz, rock.  You decide.  I initially fell in love with his voice....perfect, unfaltering, and sounds just as wonderful live.  This CD (as well as anything he has produced) will appeal to anyone who appreciates GOOD music.  I also recommend getting his concert DVD &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;.  You will never be able to see him perform live again (he died in a bizarre swimming accident a few years ago) but this is the best substitute.
B000007T2Z|5.0|The Place of Dead Roads is the title of a novel by William S. Burroughs, and, while music and book have nothing to do with each other, it always struck me as a perfectly honed phrase to describe the music of Godspeed.  By now, anyone reading this, with the preceeding 20 odd reviews will know the &quot;facts&quot; about the band (nine-piece collective living in the hinterlands of Canada, yadda yadda); I care not for that end of the discussion (a sort of self-propigating mythos set in motion by the stubborn refusal to go with the grain of music industry standards while not completely giving them up, a cult of personality for indie rock kids.)<br />And it's reductive to the music, which opens on to such wide vistas of heartbreaking beauty that at times its almost overwhelming.  Leave it to a bunch of Canadians to hymn the abandoned industrial parks which line the American landscape, the great machinery of industrialization falling into dust while the people who were supported by it live on, unsure of wither next in our &quot;information society.&quot;  Morricone guitar (but not as parched and isolated as label-mates Labradford) slides into sweeping, keening, crying strings, carried aloft by the force of two drummers.  Learning about the band, accessing other releases, knowing that the voice which opens &quot;Providence&quot; is Blaise Bailey Finnigan the III does detract somewhat from the shocking *newness* of hearing this record for the first time, a big, yearning yelp of pain and confusion and beauty falling out of the black.  Ah...I can't describe it; there are moments on this record which easily rank with the best music has to offer (the opening of &quot;All Tomorrows Parties,&quot; those first piano chords in &quot;So What?&quot;, the throbbing heartbeat that hums underneath Astral Weeks.)  Essential.
6303168507|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It shows Spielberg at his best, and he deserved the Best Director Oscar.<br />This film is completely mesmerizing.  It has wonderful performances all around, especially by Liam Neeson and Ralph Finnes.  this is not the feel good movie of the year, though.  It is a horrific look at what the Nazi's did to the Jews and others who were &quot;inferior to the master race&quot;.<br />This is a horrific movie, and very disturbing.  I could not believe how evil people can be.  This movie, though, horrific enough, puts some of the Holocaust mildly.  If you want to see it worse, go to the Holocaust Museuem in Washington, D.C.<br />Ralph Finnes shows how evil people can be, and you are actually seduced by him.  Liam Neeson shows that in a world of evil, there is still a little bit of good.  John williams score is so breathtaking, it goes right along with the feeling of the Jews.<br />This movie also has one of the greatest moments in movie history, in my opinion.  At the end of the movie, each one of the actual Schindler Jews puts a flower or something on his actual grave.  That made me cry.  I never cry at movies.  That was very powerful.<br />This is not a movie to watch again and again.  It is very disturbing.  But, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  It is an experience everyone should have.
0679405496|5.0|Forster writes about the ruling British and their tentative relationship with India in the early part of the 20th Century.  While Kipling wrote of an India of intrigue and adventure, Forster's India is one of mistrust and racism between the British and the natives.<br />The main charcter is a Moslem Indian, Dr. Aziz,who is abused by his British superior and learns to mistrust all British. Aziz meets Mrs. Moore , a new arrival, by chance at a mosque. After first ridiculing her, Aziz develops a deep respect for Mrs. Moore who he believes possesses more Oriental qualities than European qualities. Through Mrs. Moore, Aziz develops a frienship with Fielding, an educator, very interested in discovering what India is all about.  <br />Mrs. Moore's is accompanied to India by her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested. Although extremely naive, Adela has the same inquisitiveness as does Fielding. Aziz desperately wants to impress his new British friends and he invites Adela, Mrs. Moore, and Fielding to be his guest as he shows them the Marbar caves, a local landmark.<br />On the fateful day all parties realize that the tour is not a good idea but each is reluctant to cancel the event. The mystery of what occurred within the caves and the aftermath is the crux of the story.<br />The incident at the cave does irrevocable harm to each of the main characters but particularly Mrs. Moore whose spirit totally disintegrates and Adeala who is rediculed and villified by the British. <br />Finally at the end, Aziz and Fielding repair their friendship as best they can, each realizing that Indians and Brits will enjoy a suspicious friendship at best.
B000003TA4|5.0|This lyric at the end of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', is one of the best lyrics ever written, because I think it helps explain a whole generation that was pretty much ignored until this record was made, and 'alternative' music was launched into the mainstream.

Remember the Time was a bit worse but listenable, but all the other songs R on this album R even worse than the opening track, Jam.... Get a Jackson Best Of instead, containing those three hits, that R really good. Give in 2 Me is the song that just doesn't fit into this album's weakness, it should be appeared on a better one in the future.

And starring Peter O'Toole as &quot;Lawrence.&quot; This  movie truly shows how the arabs were in the period of World War 1 and how they were unable to govern Damascus because of their lack of experience in governing and  because they were divided into tribes.  This is truly a must see movie for all viewers interested in History and civilizations.

And starring Peter O'Toole as &quot;Lawrence.&quot; This  movie truly shows how the arabs were in the period of World War 1 and how they were unable to govern Damascus because of their lack of experience in governing and  because they were divided into tribes.  This is truly a must see movie for all viewers interested in History and civilizations.
0446310786|4.0|Who knew a classic could be oh so totally cool the first time you tried to read it back when you were 14. It made sense at 14, it makes better sense now.  Harper Lee has an amazing story telling ability and she potrays the young girl Scout so well. Its almost as if the story was written from Scouts view. Incredible characterizations. Thats what really swept me off my feet, along with the amazing setting description. You could feel the heat, you could feel the hate, you can just really FEEL this book!
0789723107|5.0|&quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot;, make my job or task effortless, let me blissfully cruise through your web site buy whatever it is you are selling, or take the next step toward a commercial exchange.  That, in essence, is the focus of the book.  <br />Others have labeled this book basic, &quot;for beginners&quot;; it is a simple message, but think about the sites you frequent, doesn't the title sum up your experiences there?<br />In much the same way Roy Williams gives the number crunchers of advertising a reality check in &quot;The Wizard of Ads&quot;, Steve Krug does with web site usability.  The book is fluid easy reading.  It provides suggestions for usability testing on a budget, and quick, simple, usability ideas for those who may have become bogged down in the latest technology and bloated design.  <br />Large-scale site development requires solid information architecture, layout, and design.  This book is no substitute for that process, but it masterfully delivers on what it claims to be - &quot;A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability&quot;
B00000I41J|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite jazz albums. I always keep a spare one at home as special present to people who I think might appreciate it. Especially the opener, Autumn Leaves, is a masterpiece. Miles's trumpet playing on it has convinced me to try to learn this instrument.
B000002JSJ|5.0|One of the great things about Led Zeppelin was the shear diversity of styles and sounds on their records. Presence on the other hand sounds like they didn't even bother turning the amps off between tracks, that they thrashed it out in one sitting - and that's one of the reasons I love it so much.<br />Aside from it's shear weight (and it's pretty weighty), what makes this record for me the greatest record Led Zeppelin ever made are the s p a c e s. They're all over the record - For Your Life, Royal Orleans, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Hots On For Nowhere. And sometimes, through the course of the song spaces get filled and then they're even better - what am I talking about? - listen to Hots On For Nowhere.<br />And talking of fills ... those drums - John Henry Bonham - never Mr Subtle - enough to keep an army going for weeks. Fantastic. It has one of the greatest harmonica solos I've ever heard (Nobody's Fault But Mine) and, oh my word, 'Tea for One'! Someone once wrote it was too slow - what like the Grand Canyon's too deep? It's my all-time favourite Led Zeppelin song - it's oh so much better than 'Since I've Been Loving You' (perhaps a distant cousin?).<br />So my favourite Led Zeppelin record is Presence - is there something wrong with me? I'm sure most will disagree, and none more so than the members of the group (yes, I know it was a miserable time for them). But all that tampering with magic and stuff did come to something - and here it is - a dark record - almost like a different band - touched by something not quite right - from cover to closer, utterly... I've said enough. Buy it.
B00003CWPL|5.0|When Eraserhead discovers that his girlfriend is pregnant, he does the \\"right thing\\": he marries her. Men often find themselves in deep trouble by doing the right thing, and Eraserhead is no exception. He and the little Misses move into a tiny flat and face all the common problems that newlyweds often encounter: a tight budget, lack of romance, and oh yea, a hairless rat attached to a bandaged potato. The Hairless Rat cries all night, and Mrs. Eraserhead, suffering from postpartum depression, returns to live with her parents.<br />Now Eraserhead is alone with the Hairless Rat and all the overbearing responsibilities of fatherhood. Actually, the Hairless Rat doesn't require a lot of care, so Eraserhead has time to seduce the woman living across the hall. Hey, men aren't perfect! Do you think that Eraserhead could simply put his sins behind, and raise the Hairless Rat into kindergarten? No way! He snips away at the potato's bandages, then punctures the Rat's internal organs spewing mashed potatoes all over the apartment.<br />One might assume that an adulterer and murderer would spend eternity in Hell, but considering that Eraserhead did the right thing initially, he finishes in Heaven with the Elephant Women.<br />I learned three important lessons about life from Eraserhead: there's little solace in doing the right thing, heaven isn't all that it's cracked up to be, and most importantly, always let someone else unwrap the baked potato.
B000000WF0|5.0|The Verve have come a long way since the pondering lyrics and dreamlike acoustics of their debut album &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot;, and in doing so they created some stunning songs, i.e. &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot; from &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, their second album. But it here that we hear a band that has truly reached the peak of its powers, and in The Verve's case, these powers are awe inspiring. The album opens with &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, an song that just has every emotion in it, showing singer and songwriter Richard Ashcrofts' disenchantment with life, the vicious cycle of it all, all over a beautiful orchestral rhythm, with a little help from Pete Salisbury's drums, well it all creates a swagger in your step from the knowing that someone else shares your misgivings with life in general. The album moves on the the acoustic &quot;Sonnet&quot;, a busking classic, very easy-listening, taking you deep into Ashcrofts thoughts and memories. Then comes the rock 'n' roll high point of the album-&quot;The Rolling People&quot;. Drenched in overdubs, full of classic lyrics such as &quot;I'll be the first to toast, yeah, to my rotten soul&quot;, the rhythm section of Salisbury/Jones is at its very best here thrashing its way along with McCabes and Tongs guitars. Great rock 'n' roll, very similar to a lot of The Stone Roses &quot;Second Coming&quot;. Following that is &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot;, a song that really oozes emotion, he really means every lyric on that song, it is truly beautiful. Next is the simple &quot;Catching The Butterfly&quot;, full of the moody guitars and effects that made &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot; such a memorable record. Following that is guitarist Nick McCabes &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot;, wacky, and slightly drug induced I feel, it is food for thought to say the least. &quot;Space And Time&quot; follows, it is another easy listening song, not quite as memorable as the preceding 6 tracks, yet good in its own right. &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; is a very downbeat Northern Soul song, though provoking and intimate to its intended listener. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is quite the opposite, showing a happy side to Richard Ashcroft, almost euphoric, it is the nemesis of &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot;. &quot;One Day&quot; is fairly forgettable, trying to hard to be an emotional epic, but as always with The Verve, they really do mean what they write. &quot;This Time&quot; combines a funky rhythm with simplistic and poppy lyrics, and make no mistake, this is as near to poppy as The Verve will ever get. Very similar to early Stone Roses, i.e. &quot;Fools Gold&quot;, through its recurrent riff and basslines. Then comes the third of three epic and unforgettable tracks from the album, &quot;Velvet Morning&quot; (the others being &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, and &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot;). A dull and lifeless verse is followed by a rhythmatic and stunning chorus that makes you want to sing along at the top of your voice, because you really do have an empathy with Richard Ashcroft on this one, just like &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. The closing track &quot;Come On&quot; is pretty standard fair, but the reprise is very reminiscent of &quot;The Rolling People&quot; with its swirling guitars. There's a hidden track if you let &quot;Come On&quot; keep playing too, its a prophetic Blake-esque instrumental effort, strange to say the least. All in all, this album has everything, it is a natural progression from &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot;, and it is everything a classic rock 'n' roll album should be; smooth, arrogant, understanding, performed by brilliant musicians, this is a truly under-rated album. It is as good as &quot;Sgt Peppers&quot;, if not better. I doubt another band will ever come close to making an album as complete as this one. And as Richard Ashcroft says &quot;With the music comes an attitude&quot;, just like the swagger that he has on the promo for &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; this album means business. If you like The Beatles, you'll like The Verve, they're a modern equivalent in their melodies. Buy it and you won't be disappointed, it's the soundtrack to your life; its your Urban Hymns.
B00004XOWM|3.0|the first 2 albums were definetely 5 stars but this one isnt that great... the only good songs are boiler, it'll be ok, the one and getcha groove on...rollin is way overplayed...i dunno i was just hoping for a better album
B00000064G|4.0|I first heard of Nick Drake on NPR and my husband and I could not get his music out of our heads. &quot;Haunting&quot; is perhaps the best word to describe &quot;Pink Moon&quot;. This is the only album that I have heard, so I cannot comment on all of his work. I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys acoustic guitar. Like Dylan, Drake may not have the best voice, but it is distinct and his sound will stay with you (Drake's voice is much sweeter and softer.) My biggest complaint is that this album is only about 20 minutes long. I went through 12 hours of labor sans drugs thanks to this mesmerizing album (Ironic, no?)My husband was sick of it by the time I gave in and took the epidural.
B00004SCX6|2.0|yes that is Britney for ya... this cd is worse than the first...the only good songs are When your eyes say it and One kiss from you....the fast songs sound too manufactured and the slow songs sounds way too bland...and Dear Diary..that song is a joke! this cd is overall really corny...but if you just want some fun pop to sing along to then this is for you
B00004R99E|5.0|&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; is one of my very favorite Disney movies, if not my very favorite.  I watched it for the first time on video when I was a 4th grader, and loved it.  Then I forgot about it for awhile, until I found it on the shelf at the Library last year (I'm now 15) and loved it just as much (or more!) as the first time I viewed it!! I can not get enough of it! My older brother, who will be going to a prestegious University in the Fall also loves it as well. Do not listen to the so-called &quot;professionals&quot; when they say it is a &quot;lesser disney movie&quot; and only for the young - because my older brother, my mom and I like it more than even my 6 year old brother!! <br />Max (voiced by Jason Marsden) is an uncool teenager who despertly wants the attention of his crush, Roxanne, but seems to mess us when he tries to talk to her. So, on the last day of school with the help of his 2 buddies, he pulls a ABSOLUTLY hillarious and awesome stunt to impress her in front of the whole school -(this is one of my favorite scenes!!)-, but he gets caught by the Principle who exagerates what Max did to Max's dad.  Even though he thinks he messed it up by getting caught, he goes from a nobody, to popular because he made the last day of school assembly awesome. Roxanne comes up to him, and they make plans for a upcoming party.  He feels ontop of the world but comes home to devasting news - his dad (Goofy voiced by Bill Farmer) who is well-meaning but very goofy feels that taking Max on a LONG road trip to a lake with him will shape him up by having them bond more. <br />Max, extremely upset, has to change his plans with Roxanne.  But he lies to her telling her he will appear at the Powerline Concert dancing on stage and will wave to her while she watches it at the party. (Powerline is like what Justin Timberlake is today) Max and Goofy set off on the trip with hillarious adventours and mishaps along the way.  The end is spitacluar, (something any teen would wantto do) hillarious, absoutly GREAT! (I consider the ending scene also one of the best parts!!) <br />Everything in the movie fits very well together, guarenteed to make you laugh ATLEAST once ~ many more for me that is for sure! The songs are very catchy and one of the best assests to the movie! I tried to get the orginial soundtrack but I can't find it anywhere.  The sequel is funny, but is NOTHING compared to the first. I rank &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; right up there with Disney's Robin Hood and all the other classics! A must see for EVERYONE kids, teens and adults!!
1878424319|5.0|The four agreements are:  1. Be impeccable with your word 2. Don't take anything personally 3. Don't make assumptions 4. Always do your best<br />This is a quick read, yet one of the best guides to living a good life I've ever come across. Just imagine what our lives would look like if we followed the four agreements...or if our neighbors did, or our schools, or government leaders. The agreements are so simple, yet the change that would result from their application is enormous. Please read this book and share it with others.
B00003OSSL|3.0|I likde this film. It had a different pace and was told differently from most of Hollywoods film which are made nowadays- and that is a good thing. Well acted, especially by Harrison Ford -this was a real surprise to me. This movie is not pretencious and luckily doesnt fall in too many cliches. Cute film....
B000002UY3|5.0|Mazzy Star plays the most amazing music I've ever heard.  I generally listen to harder music but I just can't get over how beutiful their music is.  I recommend it to anybody!
6305428522|5.0|Please understand that the review heading above is not an insult to the film in any way. This is a great movie with a wonderful message directed by an accomplished artist.   After watching the movie a few times in color, I would suggest that you turn off the color on your T.V. and watch it in good ol' B&amp;W. Although some scenes (the yachting sequence, for example), work better in color, B&amp;W accentuates the Frank Capra-esque Rob Morrow role. John Turturro is great in both formats. And let's not forget Ralph Fiennes, who gives a performance no mere Oscar could honor.<br />And by the way, kudos to Martin Scorsese.
6300214540|2.0|I watched this movie only to check out carrier operations because I got out of the Air Force before this movie came out. Hollywood makes entertainment movies, I havn't seen one movie where it said &quot;warning this is exactly what happens in real life in every detail.&quot; You Navy guys shut up! You know us Air Force guys don't do nothing,all our maintenence is performed &quot;mentally,we don't even have to go outside&quot;! We had 2 tornadoes hit our base at the same time,we knew they were on the way-Oklahoma weather. To bad we couldn't put C-5's,C-141's @KC-135's below deck and turn the base to port side,we may have missed the tornadoes! The movie was entertainment but I would have used another actor instead of Tom Cruise, he doesn't come across to me as tough enough to be a pilot! Val Kilmer should have been the lead! You Navy guys both pilots and mechanics- An F-15 single seater has to do the same as a 2-seat Tomcat! My Air Force job if memory serves me correctly amounts to 3 different jobs in the Navy! But I say again you know us Air Force guys we don't do nothing we got it easy! Tom Cruise should have stayed hooked up with his risky business co-star, she's the coolest and hottest chick in Hollywood,did your mommy tell you to break it off?       Jim.
B00000IONU|5.0|oh boy, was i ever happy that this album is around and that this band is around and that maybe rock n roll is still around.  I cant think of a better band that will snarl and rock real music back onto the airwaves.  i mean I CANT STAND the radio.  i cant think of the last time ive actually listened to it.  there isnt a single station in the US that plays music like the white stripes, which is why im SO thankful they are gaining some real recognition regardless.  and i grew up in deee-troit, which makes me feels all so gooey and proud that such a rockin outfit came out of such a tough-as-nails city.  Its perfectly fitting.  This album is fantastic from beginning to end, although &quot;Big Three&quot; is a personal fave for personal reasons.  But &quot;Do&quot; and &quot;Sugar Never Tasted So Good&quot; are also pretty fierce.  They are also one of the best live bands for your buck.  Considering most of their songs are like 3 minute blows to your head, its really amazing that they can actually play a 1 1/2 hour set.  They sweat, they rock, and they tear through their music like a sledgehammer.  and all with a smile.  youll smile too and be thankful the white stripes are knocking on your door.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Want to maximize profits?  Publish the diet Tom Hanks had to go on to trim down for his &quot;after&quot; scenes.  Other than that... it was okay.  Not awe inspiring, not too bad but I was expecting a bigger island, longer survival scenerio etc...  Helen hunt was good, didn't carry much over the top.  But all in all, a mindless evening in front of the tube.
B000056PWV|3.0|Like most Hitchcock flix, Rear Window is stylish and well-made. But I found it not very suspenseful at all, which is why I watch Hitchcock movies. The &quot;climax&quot; was very disappointing. How intimidating can an overweight middle age weaponless villain be?! I find &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; much more intriguing and its ending definitely more satisfying.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney Spears is the worst excuse of a female singer I've ever heard! She can't sing! She doesn't write her own music! And she's the biggest discrace to music in all history! If you want to hear some REAL female singer/songwriters listen to Alanis Morissette or Tori Amos!
B000001Y9I|4.0|I recently saw DP in concert in Texas, man, oh, man, was I knocked out! The guys sounded great! So after the show, I thought I would bulk up my DP collection on CD, starting with the Morse era, so I ordered PURPENDICULAR, Well, I've heard it 4 times already! I like all the tracks! A solid effort! I can't believe I've waited so long to buy it! Better late than never! sidenote: Imho, DP sound better now in 2001 than they did back in '85 when I first saw them in concert.
630512065X|5.0|My son and I have watched this video a number of times over the last couple of months.  My son is a 9 year old Down's Syndrome boy and I found that the music and dancing in Cats was very calming and therapeutic for him.  I enjoyed watching Cats and felt that the music and the words of the songs were beautiful.  The effect it had on my son was an added bonus.
0790743132|5.0|It is hard to know beforehand what are the perfect ingredients to make a movie live forever, but it is easy to see it when they all coalesce before one's eyes.  Casablanca, more than almost any movie, has earned the right to live on and on and deserves to be called a classic.  It has one of the finest casts ever assembled for any movie from the starring roles of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman to the supporting players such as Peter Lorre, Syndey Greenstreet, and the incomparable Claude Rains.  If watched for the first time, the dialogue will seem famaliar as most of it exists in such a quotable form even outside the film.  But just let that dialogue carry you away and you too will always have Paris.  It is a joy to watch every time and a must for any video collection. A perfect film created when all the ingredients of movie making turned to magic and now can live forever.
B00005JY1B|5.0|It's a real tear jerker.  It brings out alot of emotions.  You'll laugh, cry, get mad, etc.  It shows that you can't spend your life without love and laughter.  All work, no play...  Life is short.  Don't waste the time that you have.  Take advantage of every minute.  Live your life.  Make it count.  Keanu's character starts out as a workaholic.  His life is boring.  He eats and sleeps his job.  It's all he thinks about.  And it takes one very special person to change your life.  That person can turn your life completely upside down.  It's not hard to fall in love with that person.  Charlize's character is that type of person.  She loves life and she takes advantage of every minute that she has to help other people enjoy their lives.  I totally loved this movie.  It's one of my favorites.

B000000H4V|5.0|WELL THERE IS NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY OTHER THAN THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSSIC JUST LIKE ALL OF SEPULTURA'S ALBUMS. THE BEST SONGS ARE &quot;REFUSE/RESIST&quot; &quot;TERRITORY&quot; AND &quot;BIOTECH IS GODZILLA&quot; BUT ALL SONGS ARE GOOD AND I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY FAN OF SEPULTURA OR SOULFLY TO BUY THIS ALBUM. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
0553296981|5.0|A sad life of a little girl who lived during WW II. She escaped from Nazi to live in a small hidden place in an office building. There she learned to adapt herself to her new home and to know about love. Unfortunately the hiding place was discovered and all of them were separated and sent to Nazi camps. Anne, heartbroken and very weak, died in the camp. Her diary was found among the garbage and was kept and given to her father who somehow managed to survive. The writing was a masterpiece.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE SEPULTURA ALBUM. THE 3 BEST SONGS ARE \\"BENEATH THE REMAINS\\", \\"INNER SELF\\" AND \\"MASS HYPNOSIS BUT ALL SONGS ARE AWESOME. THIS IS A TOTAL THRASH METAL ALBUM AND ANYONE WHO CONSIDERS THEMSELVES A FAN OF THE GENRE SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THIS, IF NOT RUN OUT AND BUY IT RIGHT NOW!
B00003CWTI|1.0|This is my SECOND review of this movie. (I even watched it again so I would qualify!)   But I feel I must review this movie again in order to even out some of the *5* star reviews.  <br />Not only is this movie overly long - and as if that were its biggest flaw (!) - I mean, *Heat* runs almost three hours and the length serves that story very well; ditto *Braveheart*; ditto *Saving Private Ryan*; ditto &quot;Anna and the King* - but the excessive length of *Magnolia* does not serve it well.  In fact, it detracts from the film.  It _only_ makes me loathe this crock of dookie that is magnolia even more. <br />And, holy cow, yes, it was pretentious of pta to stretch this pile of hot steaming rubbish out to three hours in order to try to give it the air of oscar-worthiness. <br />And it was pretentious of pta to actually film this steaming pile of gutter sludge and try to make money off of it.  He should have made this film for himself and then quietly tucked it away in a vault where it wouldn't have had the opportunity to bother anyone or to have the Hollywood ad men &amp; women try to spin this dookum and try to pass it off as a serious and life-altering film-going experience. <br />And, yes, most of the (over-) acting stunk, the soundtrack was horrendous, the writing was abysmal, the directing was atrocious, the twist at the end was moronic, the plot was nonexistent. <br />Get the point?
0743420373|2.0|While this book shed's light on Americas out of control spending habits and constant desire for more items and better items, I am particularly troubled by the 40 pages of references the author makes towards purchasing cars.<br />There are several chapters on how people with millions of dollars in the bank buys 5,000 dollar cars which are less than 1 percent of their net worth while all these other people with 4 or 5 thousand in the bank are out buying 20,000 dollar cars.<br />The American automobile plays an important role in the lives of many people, we use them to get to work, to get to the store, to drop off our children at school and so forth. While I agree that many people spend too much on cars, I would say that the average person cannot buy a car that is less than one percent of their net worth for the simple fact that one, cars are expensive, and two they cannot buy a 200 dollar car because they would probably spend thousands fixing it. Sure a man with a million dollars in the bank has no worries when his 3,000 dollar car blows a transmission he has the money to fix it, but given the dependence on our vehicles to live, the average person has no choice but to make an expensive investment in a reliable vehicle rather than buying one that will be in the repair shop.<br />There are way too many car references in this book that are just not logical in this day and age.<br />I also know several very wealthy people, and while many of them do not spend lavishly on ridiculous items, they all have recognized how hard they have worked and they all have created a lifestyle that rewards this and I find it hard to believe that the many millionaires in this book live the lifestyle described.<br />The book seems to make saving money a game and he with the most in the bank when they die wins.<br />I myself have several dreams and desires and I will not hesitate to invest my hard-earned money into those dreams. What good is a million dollars in the bank when you are 80 yearsold and can't walk more anymore?
1577311523|5.0|I admit it, I'm a scientific skeptic and annoyed by &quot;new age speak&quot; and unsubstantiated claims of spiritual powers and enlightenment. So when my girlfriend recommended I read Tolle's book about the &quot;now experience&quot;, I was incredulous. However, I quickly realized Tolle's book in a category by its self. No grandiose claims, panacea remedies, or motivational empowerment here. His penetrating insights will make you STOP what you are doing, and I guess that's the point. The &quot;now awareness&quot; Tolle describes is available to everyone (new age seeker, or skeptic). My girlfriend and I have finally found common ground. If nothing else, it's a breath of sanity. Read it before you die.
0345357116|5.0|. . .which actually gives the hobbits a major place.<br />The only criticism this hobbit has of the work done by Christopher Tolkien over the years, concerns the limited amount of space given to matters involving hobbits (which, as we all know, is of supreme interest).<br />This volume does not suffer from that difficulty.  In addition to interesting lore from the First and Second Ages, there is interesting information about Wizards (a favorite hobbit topic) and some &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; recalling of Bilbo's adventure to the Lonely Mountain and the hunt for the One Ring (from the perspective of the Black Riders).<br />Although there are many fragments in this volume, the clever hobbit-dad will be able to tell stories from it to his children.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXS4|4.0|To start, Snatch is a movie that you have to watch multiple times.  If you are unfamiliar with british accents and their slang, you will DEFINATELY need to watch it multiple times.  Guy Ritchie has the habit of making things jump around unexpectantly, and you could possibly miss something.  If you watched Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you know what you're getting yourself into, mind you though, that while may of the same actors are in both movies, they don't play they same characters.  This is a funny, chaotic film that will keep you locked onto the screen.  I was very impressed with Pitt, I've never been a big fan, but this popped him higher on my list.
B0000027RL|5.0|This gotta be the best album ever made...  No doubt about that in my mind.  I bought this album in Norway, the European Version, with a live recording of Alive, and two other songs, one of them, &quot;Dirt Frank&quot;, is actually one of the best tracks on the album.  If you don't have this album and you like Alt. Rock and Grunge, you have to get it...

0812523334|4.0|The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.<br />This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.<br />My abridged edition proved to be a good reader...  The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.<br />A good book for the elementary school set.
0060931736|4.0|&quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; is about the strange relationship between a teacher at an Edinburgh girls' school and her six students in the 1930's.  To say Miss Brodie's teaching methods are unorthodox is an understatement.  She prefers taking her students to the theater and art galleries to classroom instruction, favors subjects irrelevant to the traditional school curriculum, disdains science and mathematics, believes spirituality and wisdom can be attained only through art, and is fascinated with fascism, heartily endorsing the policies of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco.  Her &quot;prime&quot; refers to the time in her life when she is able to wield a sphere of influence over her students.<br />For a teacher, Miss Brodie is strangely self-absorbed; she would rather spend time discussing the minutiae of her own life with her students instead of paying attention to their interests and welfare.  But she is possessive of them all the same.  She seems to see them as extensions of herself and wants to live vicariously through them; the reader gets the impression that she is subtly encouraging her students to become sexually active with a male art teacher whom she herself loves.  In fact, there is some playful innuendo while the art teacher paints the girls' portraits:  &quot;One day,&quot; he tells one of the girls, &quot;I would like to do all you Brodie girls, one by one and then all together.&quot;<br />Lest you think this sounds like simplistic prurient drivel for adolescent girls, it should be mentioned that there is some hauntingly deep symbolism (one of the girls, now a nun, grips the bars of a grille when her old school friends come to visit her at the convent) woven into the themes of influence, manipulation, and betrayal:  When Miss Brodie is betrayed by one of her students and loses her job, she realizes that there is a limit to which she can manipulate her students; her prime is over.
0385484518|5.0|I completely love this book.  I haven't read one better.  I realized that things that concerned me of this world are not that important.  When I die, the material things will be gone, but the love that people have for me and the memories of times we've shared will always be there.  You must read it.  I'm going to read it again and again.

B00005LMBK|5.0|...because everything he touches is golden.  I think this is some of his best work, too.  He's already wowed anybody who picked up his other producing efforts (Dr. Octagon, Handsome Boy Modelling School, Deltron 3030, etc.), but this is amazing.  To hear his sampling genious behind trip-hop and rock songs is so... fun!  I don't know how else to describe it.  It's just a wonderful listen.  Of course the producing wouldn't amount for much if he wasn't allied with great artists, and Damon, Miho, and Del don't disappoint.  Props to Jamie Hewlett for the concept of this group, which is so refreshing in this age of photogenic boy bands and teenage divas churning out crap on a weekly basis.  Let me get this straight, is he on base, too?   It doesn't matter!  And that's what is great about this band! I hope 2-D, Russel, Noodle, and Murdoc keep at it!
B000002NJS|4.0|Here's the track-by-track review:<br />1. &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot;: Very slow at beginning, very melodic.  A reflection on how fame has changed Madonna in so many ways.  I like the guitar part in the middle.<br />2. &quot;Swim&quot;: A nice little guitar/violin intro.  A very cool bass beat.  There's a beat that makes you feel like you're in a ocean, like Madonna says.<br />3. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;: LOVE THIS SONG!!!  But anyhow... A very good dance/club track.  Something to 'bob' your head too.  A kinda happy-go-lucky tune.<br />4. &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;: Cool 'underground'-ish beat.  Interesting lyrics and its meaning.  I like the beats on here too.<br />5. &quot;Skin&quot;: Very techno-ish.  Slow at first, then she turns up the volume and pumps it up to another extreme.  Another head bob-ing song.<br />6. &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;: Every time I hear this song (at the beginning) I'm reminded of &quot;Frozen&quot;...I don't know why!  Then I'm reminded of the video and all the 'crazy' people.<br />7. &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;: Another good club track.  I like the beats.  Slow, melodic at the beginning.  Then it's the 'underground'-ish tech beats again.<br />8. &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot;: A good beat song to yoga too. (I don't know!)  I know that Madonna was inspired by all the spirtual things she experienced before recording this album so...<br />9. &quot;Frozen&quot;: I like the violins at the beginning.  Very, very, very melodic at the beginning.  Very moving and kinda dark-ish.  A whispering Madonna sings in this song.<br />10. &quot;The Power of Good-bye&quot;: This is my favorite song off this album.  Kinda sad...  Interesting beats again.  I just don't like when she says 'You wanna go higher?'  It reminds me of a performance that she did.  [Evil memory]<br />11. &quot;To Have and Not to Hold&quot;: Kinda latin-ish beat, infused with techno, club beats.  I can invision someone doing a tango to this song (I don't knowwhy!)<br />12. &quot;Little Star&quot;: This is a nice song dedicated to Lola (Madonna's first child).  Everyone knows this song's meaning and everyone thinks it's pretty cool.  (Or at least I think so.)<br />13. &quot;Mer Girl&quot;: Very quiet tune.  Another Madonna reflection/inspiration song.  Another 'checking fame at the door'.  Another melodic song.<br />Overall review: 4 stars:  This is one of the best Madonna albums I've heard, even though it's been 3 years since she released this.  It has good tech beats fused with Madonna's reflectional lyrics.
6305499365|5.0|Spot on parody of office life.  Good cast, good laughs, great music and hillarious one liners give this movie a special place in my heart.
6300214710|5.0|Pretty in Pink is a 3 thumbs up movie. It's about an underprivileged girl named Andie Walsh. She is bright, beautiful, independent and really talented on the sewing machine (if you know what I mean)Her mother walked out on her and her father 3 years earlier, so this causes her dad to not be able to hold down a job. She's hassled at school by popular &quot;richies.&quot; Her best friend, Duckie, who's real name is &quot;Phil,&quot; secretly loves her. Her mentor is her boss at a small record store, Iona. Her life suddenly turns up when she's asked out by a rich romeo, Blane McDunnough. They're very happy until all of the richies force Blane to dump her while Duckie is mad at Andie. Now Andie, an underprivileged Cinderella, has to choose between two prom prince's, a rich guy of her dreams, or the person who dedicated his life to her. <br />   This movie has a happy ending and a genius plot that will bring tears to your eyes. I highly recommend this movie for everyone! Molly Ringwald did a stunning performance and really opened up the 80's eyes to what people who aren't rich go through in suburban america.
B00005LMBK|1.0|The single Clint Eastwood is maybe the best single this year in my opinion, where it had a nice blend of rock, rap and a little techno. I was so excited by the idea of the other songs on the Gorillaz album being similair to it I bought it. Boy was I in for a shock when every track except Clint Eastwood was background music mindless techno, with nothing clever or exciting in there to captivate my interest. So before I leave just imagine standing in an elevator for a few hours, hooting and hollering to the elevator music. Know where you are?  At a Gorillaz concert.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been a Tool fan for many years and their music is always a refreshingly new blast of sounds.  I would recommend this cd to anyone, it is exceptionaly well thought out. The songs on here are up to par with the rest of Tool's music and I will never get tired of hearing it.  If you like Undertow or Aenima, you must get this cd, you won't be disapointed.
B000001FS3|4.0|Much of 80's music was cluttered with big hair, flashy clothes, and flashy guitar work. U2 was truly on the opposite end of the spectrum. Who would have thought that a band with a guitarist who plays one note all the time could hit this big?!! Nevertheless this album has sold 15 million world wide and 10 million in the US. With &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; U2 had REALLY homed in on their sound and their image. I feel as if U2 reached their pinnacle with this effort. You know you've got something unique when no other band can copy your sound. Joshua Tree is sort of a &quot;concept album&quot; as it captures a real mood of independence with their sound, lyrics, album photos, etc.  <br />The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because the I find myself skipping past tracks 8 through 11 as well as &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;. If these tracks were as strong as the other songs then maybe this album would have sold 30 million. Nevertheless the 4 or 5 others are super big classics. In compliment to their live show it's too bad &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; will never sound on CD as huge as is did when I saw U2 open with this song at the LA Coliseum. It blew everyone away!
B00003CXAT|5.0|&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is a special effects extravaganza, a marvel of the modern age of moviemaking in which anything is possible. Through Steven Speilberg's vision and scope, the dream of dinosaurs comes to life amidst a story full of action and suspense. Director Steven Speilberg guides a powerhouse cast through a balance of jaw-dropping amazement and moments of sheer terror as a world unlike anything we've ever seen onscreen goes from peaceful to nightmarish. <br />While having a troubled time finding funds for their archeological digs, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) are payed a visit by billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who offers to give them their money in return for their opinions on a new theme park he is opening on a secluded island off the west coast of South America. Eager to do what they can, the two agree, and away they go, joining Dr. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) and Don Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), who are along to investigate the park's safety. <br />The cast for the picture brings out the best in each character. Neill and Dern are a nice couple with an off-beat chemistry, and they bring out the eagerness in each of their characters. Attenborough is wonderfully eccentric as his role requires him to be, while Goldblum provides subtle comical relief as Malcom. <br />Once they arrive, they discover that the park is not a mere theme park, but a place where real dinosaurs, from those as tall as trees to those smaller that a car, roam the lush, green terrain. Their creation stems from DNA authoring, in which the DNA strands from a dinosaur are taken and mixed with that of a frog in order to complete the sequence needed for birth. Some cynics will sneer at this fictitious plot device, but really, this is Speilberg's territory, and it fits in well with the rest of the story. <br />Any inhibitions of your own will be squandered once the second act begins. A tropical storm makes its way to the island, right in the middle of a tour of the park, but not before adding two more visitors, Hammond's grandchildren, to the equation. After a greedy park worker steals embryos from the park's refrigeration chamber, he must shut down all the electrical gates in order to make it to his destined drop-off point. With those fences off, our little group is stuck in the middle of the park without any way of getting back except on foot, and the predators are free to roam the entire island, wreaking havoc everywhere. <br />Speilberg's ability to overload us with super-charged scenes of suspense and action is still in its finest form. The darkness of night and storm add to the immense terror of not knowing what is on the other side of those fences, but once the tyrannosaurus rex emerges, all hell breaks loose in a stunning ten-minute sequence that leaves us on the edge of our seat. <br />One of the first things a child learns about in his years of elementary school are prehistoric creatures, which is what makes this movie so special. All those childhood fantasies come to life in Speilberg's visionary film, and while special effects have become far more advanced since the making of this movie, there is no denying that this is one of the most spectacular effects films ever made. The wizardry of creating the dinosaurs gives us a unique vision of their enormous scope and scale, while also keeping the fear at a maximum. <br />There may never be a movie that captures our imaginations so vividly as &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; a movie that captures the attention of adults as well as children for many years after its initial release. It's a pure piece of fantasy, but one that is kept at the maximum with special effects and a high suspense factor. It may not be the most enthralling movie ever made, but it certainly packs a whallop.
B000001ES9|3.0|Look up all the Rock albums of 1976 and it'll be hard to find this even once. This was when Rush was a regular rock band. You can hear the Cream and Led Zeppelin [influence] however. For Led Zep:Need Some Love, for Cream:Every song has that feel. John Rutsey is an amazing drummer, and is very underated(I like to know what happened to him after Rush), but as everyone has said, Neil is a far better drummer. However, the bass and guitar were perfect...as usual. Listen to the bass playing on \\"What You're Doing,\\" and \\"In The Mood.\\" Some of these songs are just plain goofy. Horrible lyrics like \\"In The Mood\\" and \\"What You're Doing is just being silly. The closest thing to prog at all is \\"Here Again.\\" This band could've gone anywhere after this album. It's weird how they almost completly changed after \\"Fly by Night.\\" Here you had the old Rush, with 4 to 7 minute songs. Then there's the ever present Rush, with songs from 5 minutes to 20 minutes. They made a right choicewith their 2nd album, but this will always be a rock album. That cover art is so corny.
B00005J79H|1.0|There's a reason why this CD has not been released in the U.S. yet--it's the weakest Scorpions production to date!  Going unplugged is a great idea if it is produced and mixed correctly.  (An example of excellent production is the KISS Unplugged CD.) Where are the guitars on this Scorpions CD?  More focus is given to the female backup singers and the synthesized background effects on some songs.  These &quot;unplugged&quot; songs are way too slick and over-orchestrated.  Some of these versions are closer to lounge music and easy listening than rock.  I will say that Klaus' voice sounds fantastic, but his efforts are ruined by the sugar-sweet background singers doing the chorus parts! I was looking forward to hearing new and different versions of these songs, but this CD has no &quot;WOW&quot; factor for me at all.  I've been following the Scorps since the late 70's and this was really a letdown.  I do agree with many of the other reviewers that it is way past time for the band to record a new studio LP!
B000007638|5.0|In 1976, Wings, fronted by the legendary Paul McCartney, played a tour of the U.S.  It turned out to be one of  the greatest tours ever and resulted in arguably the best live album ever.  Wings--at this point consisting of Paul, his wife Linda on keyboards, Denny Laine and Jimmy McCulloch on guitars, and drummer Joe English--was at the top of their game as shown by the tracks on this two-disc set.<br />Disc 1:<br />&quot;Venus and Mars&quot;/&quot;Rock Show&quot;/&quot;Jet&quot;--Once in a lifetime medley of the VENUS AND MARS opener and the great song from BAND ON THE RUN.<br />&quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;--Another BoTR track, performed grandly.<br />&quot;Spirits of Ancient Egypt&quot;--Denny Laine's first lead vocal on this album, taken from VaM, bettering that version.<br />&quot;Medicine Jar&quot;--Jimmy McCulloch's sole lead vocal is also from VaM and it really rocks.<br />&quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;--taken from McCARTNEY, this also betters that version.  This version was a Top Ten single.<br />&quot;Call Me Back Again&quot;--Paul sounds bored at the start, but soon goes rockin' in another VaM track.<br />&quot;Lady Madonna&quot;--first Beatles song performed on this set is a grand version of the #1 single.<br />&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;--another Beatles song, taken from LET IT BE, gives us the first ever version without Phil Spector's (over)production.<br />&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;--title track to the James Bond film is given an explosive (literally!) treatment here.<br />&quot;Picasso's Last Words&quot;--an acoustic set starts with this BoTR track.<br />&quot;Richard Cory&quot;--Denny Laine's second lead vocal is a cover of a Simon and Garfunkel song.<br />&quot;Bluebird&quot;--BoTR returns in this set with another fine acoustic number.<br />&quot;I've Just Seen a Face&quot;--first ever live version of this HELP! track is a great attraction to this set.<br />&quot;Blackbird&quot;--not to be confused with two spaces above, this is another Beatles song taken from the &quot;White Album.&quot;<br />&quot;Yesterday&quot;--last song in this set and last Beatles song, also from HELP!, is this enduring classic.  Got the loudest applause of all the songs.<br />Disc 2:<br />&quot;You Gave Me the Answer&quot;--goofy vaudeville VaM track is performed great here but it left out the spoken words!<br />&quot;Magneto and Titanium Man&quot;--goofy comic book VaM track is given a rockin' spin for the concert.<br />&quot;Go Now&quot;--Denny Laine lead vocal on one of his hits during his stint with the Moody Blues.<br />&quot;My Love&quot;--sole track from RED ROSE SPEEDWAY is this McCartney love song with a fantastic guitar solo.<br />&quot;Listen to What the Man Said&quot;--first of three &quot;underappreciated&quot; songs on this album is this VaM track.<br />&quot;Let 'Em In&quot;--second of those three is the first off WINGS AT THE SPEED OF SOUND and was Wings' latest single (#3 on the charts).<br />&quot;Time to Hide&quot;--Denny Laine's fourth and final lead vocal is his vocal spotlight from WAtSoS.<br />&quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;--the last of those three is the most overbashed McCartney song, but their latest #1 and also from WAtSoS.<br />&quot;Beware My Love&quot;--last WAtSoS song is this underrated rocker and the other side of &quot;Let 'Em In.&quot;<br />&quot;Letting Go&quot;--last of VaM tracks is this above average rocker.<br />&quot;Band on the Run&quot;--last of the BoTR tracks is this great live version that made me buy this after hearing it on the radio.<br />&quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;--hit (and banned) rock single makes an appearance here.<br />&quot;Soily&quot;--McCartney concert closer is only avaliable here and is absolutely blistering.<br />This is an absolute great piece of live rock.  Unfortunately, import only.  Capitol, release this album!  Well worth the price though.  The title, BTW, comes from what Paul said before starting &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi.&quot;<br />Paul, my answer is an unwavering &quot;YES!&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|Its obvious .. This album is a bautiful work of art on its own, but not only does the album go away from what people expected after ok computer, it goes away from the primary fan base of radio head fans. Granted it doesn't leave everybody out in the cold, but I think it just upset the fans who now belive that another Ok computer will never happen. There should be plenty of new fans, expecially Experamental electronic fans, and the few Sigur Ros fans that didn't listen to radio head before now. Its a wonderfully textured and layer album with amazing songs .. a perfect &quot;what if&quot; as in what if Alternative rock had its own variation on trip hop. And what if thom york used his genious to craft emotionally charge electronic music. This album is highy underrated. And Deserves an easy 5 stars.
0761119752|1.0|Sorry to be negative, but this book just didn't rate with me.  We have every other Boyton book (through Amazon, I might add), but this one had no substance.  It contained none of the cleverness of the Going to Bed Book, the fun of Barnyard Dance, or educational elements of Hippos Go Berserk.  Classics such as these undoubtedly set high expectations, but I found this one to be a brand extension one step too far.  There are lots of other more worthy alternatives.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album IS the best album in the world.  I don't know what the people who deny this are thinking.  I don't entirely get the whole argument about &quot;Concept Album,&quot; but it doesn't matter.  This is beauty. Songs contending for the best song in the world include Within You Without You, by Harrison.  This is a beautiful one to listen to with headphones, turned up pretty loud.  Then Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, showcasing Lennon's brilliance even when in a bit of a slump in his career.  The lead guitar in &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; turns it into probably the most &quot;get-into&quot;-able song from 1960-1970.  It's truly amazing.  The other songs just heighten the effect in a perfectly-put-together album, and it's beautiful. True, this is not the oldies band that we once knew.  But it is even much better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Who said that this movie was based on historycal facts ?? : So what's all the BS from the over reviewers about a gladitor woould never do this or that ; an emperor blablablablabla...... If you want history go to the library and get a book ! If you want great action, great settings, beautiful pictures and exceptional acting then get this movie !!!!!!!!!! Crowe &amp; Phoenix are great, the story is full of action, suspense, love, etc... Great movie
080017948X|5.0|In this movie Bill Murray plays Phil, a TV weatherman working for a local station in Pennsylvania but convinced that national news stardom is in his grasp. Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self-centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita played by the charming Andie MacDowell and cameraman Larry played by Chris Elliot. On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; nothing her tries gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others. He starts to respect people, he tries to save the life of a homeless man, and he discovers that he's falling in love with Rita and therefore wants to be someone that she could love in return.
B000001F84|5.0|Those who compare the title track of '2112' with other progressive rock works, I think don't get it.  It belongs in an entirely different 'rank'.  The only other musician who's works are of this aestetic rank, that it is valid to compare to this, is, prehaps, Wagner.<br />It is THAT good.  This isn't rock and roll, it's not progressive rock, it's not a 'concept album'.  It is pure music, from the uninterpretted heart of the Muse, but in a form, that even the masses can understand (unlike, for instance, 'Caress of Steel').
B00005A1VG|5.0|Robin Hood is one of the best films ever made in my opinion and Errol Flynn is perfect for the role of Robin Hood.  This is one not to miss.
0064431274|4.0|A bit too repetitive, but I like the idea of looking for a friend.
0446608955|5.0|I found that it was very hard to put this book down. It's probably the best book that I've read. A Walk To Remember is a definite reach-for-the-kleenex-box book. I should say that I don't think it deserves five stars but 4 and a half. The only thing that brings it down is that it seems a bit unrealistic at times. Especially through the middle of the book when one of the main characters &quot;Landon&quot; suddenly falls in love with &quot;Jamie&quot; the other main character. I just couldn't give it four stars.<br />I reccommend that you buy this book because it's a story that isn't like the others that are out there. Look for the movie of a &quot;Walk to Remember&quot; coming late 2001 or early 2002. It will star MANDY MOORE and SHANE WEST. This books brings you through so many emotions. It makes you laugh, smile, frown and more.
0671449028|3.0|I love Sandra Boynton's books for their sing-song verse and adorable illustrations; but my 14-month-old loves only some of them.  This one is a bit confusing for her, I believe.  Just when her vocabulary is taking off, this book hits her with some animals that even I can't positively identify.  The animals are on a boat, which doesn't make sense out of context.  After bathing and just before bed, they engage in vigorous exercise, for some reason.  The book seems to present a bedtime routine and seems designed to read to your child during his/her bedtime routine, but I'm finally deciding we're better off shelving this one until it can at least invoke a couple of giggles from my toddler, if not genuine understanding.
B00003CXDG|2.0|The inferior sequel rears its ugly head yet again.  Classic John Woo action is the only thing that makes this movie.  Other than that, there is nothing else that you will find remarkable.  <br />First of all, the surprises, twists and turns and shocks of the first movie are just completely left out in this movie.  You never would have expected some of the events in the first one to happen, but they did.  In this film, you see everything coming a mile away.  The very few scenes that are intended to be shocking or surprising are too blatantly obvious to deliver the effect.<br />The plot suffers from misdirection and boredom.  With a cheesy love sub-plot thrown into a story about a killer virus that a former IMF agent is eager to get his hands on, there isn't much you'll find enjoyable or engrossing.  Missing the suspense of the original, you won't need to think or try to put two and two together.  And once again, a renegade IMF agent is the villain.  What is it with these guys?  Do they go evil after they have one too many missions?  Everything is pretty much right there on a platter.<br />The action is classic John Woo, but becomes way too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Ethan Hunt has accuracy with his gun that would make the Terminator jealous, and pulls off stunts that are just a bit too over-the-top for my tastes.  I also didn't know that they make guns with unlimited ammo nowadays.  Throughout the whole movie, you will see Ethan Hunt reload his gun no more than one time.  The motorcycle and driving stunts are done fairly well, but again, become too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Last time I checked, Ethan Hunt was an IMF agent, not Neo from the Matrix.<br />Overall, if you want some mindless action and crazy stunts, then you might enjoy this movie.  However, if you enjoyed the first movie, you will probably find that this sequel is going to fall short of expectations.  The film moves slowly, and the end fight drags on way too much, at which point you will beasking yourself 'when is it gonna end?'  Unfortunately, M:I2 does not live up to the hype, or the lofty expectations of the original.
B00000DR52|5.0|After seeing the film for the first time, I was stunned by the amazing beauty and emotional content that could be created by simply telling a tragic real-life story. But it wasn't until buying the soundtrack that I realised, although the film would have been incredible and artistic on its own, it was the music that created the depth of mood that made the film so poignant. The tracks are hauntingly beautiful, and reflect all aspects of the film; the culture, the sorrow and the reminiscence of another era long gone. I recommend the soundtrack for anyone who has seen and loved the film. The combination of traditionally Chinese instruments with &quot;a Western touch&quot; is brilliantly skillful, and will appeal even to those who haven't had a preference for classical music before. Although the last couple of tracks may falter with Red Guard music and chants, the vast majority are instantly recognisable and deeply touching.
0807126063|5.0|The satirical genius of John Kennedy Toole will be sorely missed. A Confederacy of Dunces is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad - but seldom boring (the exceptions being the over-long excerpts from Ignatius Reilly's diary). The contrast between the twisted mind of Ignatius (who is wonderfully characterized) and the secondary characters provides an interest in the main character that might otherwise be watered down. And yet the secondary characters are also real and provide a lively backdrop for Toole's book.<br />There are also some serious underlying messages in 'Confederacy'. Exposing the perceived flaws of 20th century living being paramount, along with the author's political wisdoms<br />The second half of the story slows down a bit after a pacey first half. Nonetheless, 'A Confederacy of Dunces' is one I shall take to my desert island with me, because it's a book which can be read time and again, just to enjoy the characters.
0525945636|4.0|I really don't understand all the negative reviews I've seen on this board.  I read this book in 3 days (Very fast for me) because I simply could not put it down.  The plot engages you from page 1, and twists and turns throughout the entire novel.  I was riveted as I read Code to Zero!!<br />This is a fantastic book to take along on vacation - it reads fast, and will definitely take  your mind away from your day-to-day worries and hassles of work, etc.  I loved the characters, the plot, and the theme, and will definitely go read some of Follett's earlier works.<br />GREAT BOOK!!
B00005AWRL|1.0|Avoid this bloated piece of self-indulgence.  At two-and-a-half hours it should have been cut by a third. *Traffic* tells you everything you need to know about what's wrong with Hollywood films.  The fact that it has been nominated for, and won, so many awards is a comment on just how bad the movies surrounding it are.  The vaunted &quot;multiple-plot&quot; structure is clumsy, the endless tracking shots become boring very quickly, and realistic character development is non-existent (with the exception of the &quot;Rodrigez&quot; character).  The number of improbabilities we are asked to accept is an insult to the intelligence, and the smarmy ending screams of intellectual dishonesty.  A number of people are killed, but the emotional impact is practically zero.  If you get the chance to watch the British mini-series upon which this film is &quot;based&quot; (i.e. ripped off and dumbed down)grab it - then you'll see a real exploration of the topic of drugs and society.  In the meantime, Hollywood continues its run of cliche-ridden films posing as real commentary on complex issues and events (eg. *American Beauty* and *Saving Private Ryan*). The fact that the industry is so self-congratulatory about such dreck demonstrates its artistic bankruptcy.
B00004SCX6|5.0|As a huge fan of Britney, not a die hard fan, this album is very good. Don't just downgrade this album because of the way she dresses. This album was very well arranged with a tune for everyone. The best songs on this album are &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;What U See Is What U Get&quot;, &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot;. This cd should be in everp pop lover's collection. Make sure you pick up this album now, you might just be surprised.
B000002UE9|4.0|Fun, good old rock music. Nothing complex about Poison's music, just a party on an album. Not for all music fans, listen before purchasing!
B000000WCV|5.0|this is a perfect album! ambiental, critical, and several sounds, combined for create THE ETERNAL MASTERPIECE. BREAK!homeworkperfectdaftendirekt!!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|From the school of Pink Floyd, Radiohead has challenged the music scene to break thru barriers. Pink Floyd began this quest well over 20 years ago, but rock music didn't listen. Maybe Radiohead can persuade the masses. This album IS NOT for everyone. Some will love and others will HATE it. Great headphone music. Very cerebral and surreal!
B00005LMBK|2.0|inspired for children? or created for destroy MASSES?  .......listen this record,SUPERTOYS...or something!
B000056K04|4.0|DMB puts out another collection of fantastic songs. Honestly, artist usually put all the best songs near the front of the recording, BUT not this time! Obviously, I love &quot;I Did It&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot;, but check out &quot;What You Are&quot; and &quot;Mother Father&quot;. DMB is not for every music fan, but you might be pleasantly surprised...very relaxing, creative, and soulful music.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've ever seen... Better than the first 2 Evil Deads in my opinion... Ash is the man, I can tell you that...<br />The skeletons are great special effects as are the deadites... Some of the other effects, sadly, aren't... But, I can forgive those because this movie is so great...<br />Any movie with such classic one-liners as &quot;Hail to the King, Baby...&quot; and &quot;Gimme some sugar baby...&quot; is great in my book
B00004WGAI|5.0|Having seen most of the film and video versions of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel, this BBC version by far is the best. The acting performances are particularly distinguished, not only by the lead characters of Jane and Rochester but also by the supporting cast. Timothy Dalton's charismatic Rochester is so powerfully convincing that his performance makes the &quot;other&quot; Rochesters anemic in comparison. His lines resonate with authority, and he is suitably harsh and sardonic one moment, then arrestingly tender and humorous the next. Dalton has a physical presence and fine voice that capture the essence of the male lead...excellent casting, here. I think there  is great chemistry between Dalton's Rochester and Zelah Clarke's Jane. True, Dalton is much too easy on the eyes to visually be an authentic &quot;ugly&quot; Rochester, but his characterization and delivery are so accurate I am quite willing to overlook this minor point! Zelah Clarke's Jane is an intelligent combination of iron will and reserve, passion and compassion. Visually she is a petite, pale Jane, although not altogether &quot;plain&quot;. I liked the way she visually &quot;blossomed&quot; from a repressed, somewhat dowdy schoolmarm to the glowingly beloved betrothed of her &quot;master&quot;. I think Clarke's interpretation is also the most authentic I have seen; however there were moments I think that a little less reserve might be called for. Both Dalton and Clarke are admirable in the way they convey thought and emotion without words. The scenes between our leading characters here are often  heartrending and spiced with pithy humour. I thought the featured &quot;Mr. Brocklehurst&quot; was suitably prissy and annoying. Also &quot;Mrs. Reed&quot; in this version was superbly done, as was &quot;Mrs. Fairfax&quot;. Great performances all around.  The novel, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is complex and difficult to do justice to on film or video. The near 4 hour length of this version is certainly calledfor. I don't believe the impact of the story can be fully realized in 1 1/2 to 2 hours as other versions have attempted to do.I am gratified that certain portions of the book were not left out, such as the &quot;gypsy&quot; and Moore House segments, and that the Gateshead and Lowood portions were not hastily glossed over.  I am also pleased how faithful to the novel this version is, and that the lines were pulled straight from the novel. A true Jane Eyre addict who is very familiar with the book can easily go back and forth from video to novel without feeling a sense of outrage from the liberties that other screenplays have taken. I have such respect for this video of Jane Eyre that it is Dalton's and Clarke's voices I &quot;hear&quot; when I read the book. This cast and performance would have benefited from a more lavish &quot;cinematic&quot; production....I look for a better musical score in particular, but these are minor points...the strong performances here are what make this video version of Jane Eyre superior to the rest. For those who enjoy this genre, this video is a must-see, and for many, a must-have. I hope this comes out on DVD soon, and includes the material that I understand was cut from the original BBC airing.
B000002LGA|3.0|I bought this CD when it was originally released in 1989 and listened to it a lot; one day I dropped it into the changer and the lyrics that had originally struck me as deadly earnest now sounded bloated and preachy.  The music is great, with first-rate no-frills guitar/bass/drums, although the producer found it necessary to put Reed's voice so far out front that it sometimes drowns out the instrumentation; interesting decision, when you consider how limited Reed's voice is.<br />On the other hand, you have to hear the lyrics.  That's what this CD is about; Reed's seemingly off-the-top-of-his-head musings and rantings about every late-80s newsworthy subject.  Ironically, the song that has aged most well to my ears is &quot;Beginning of a Great Adventure&quot;, in which he turns his attention inward, contemplating fatherhood, albeit in his own sardonic way.<br />Die-hard Reed fans have to love this CD; it's him all over; a good effort by one of the patriarchs of alternative rock.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is a review of George Lucas...not his Star Wars series of movies. Amazon. com predicted that I would rate this movie at 4 stars. Actually I rate it at 5. But George Lucas himself dosn't even rate the first star. 24 YEARS TO MAKE 4 MOVIES????!!!!!! Someone wake this guy up and give hime a cup of hot coffee. We could have seen many more of these movies by now even allowing 3 years per movie we would have twice a much Star Wars on our shelves. His marketing sucks. He waited far to long to release Episode 1 on dvd not to mention episode 4,5,&amp;6. Re-releasing movies to suck money out of our pockets. Waiting untill after the original trilogy is released in regular format to release THX wide-screen format. I have the Star Wars trilogy in Beta, Laser Disc and 3 different vhs versions and now he wants my money for DVD, and I'll likely be dead by the time I see the final dvd release of the original 3. Someone please help...George Lucas is subjecting me to a slow death!
0425098478|4.0|If you can't take something directly from THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER to make you a better manager, you can take something from it and modify it.  Maybe in reality your company can't run efficiently on the &quot;one-minute&quot; theory.  But you could on a &quot;five-minute&quot; or &quot;ten-minute&quot; concept.  Even that adjustment would cut down on the wasted prodution during those &quot;costly&quot; meetings.<br />When I first looked at the book, I thought it too small to be efficient.  However, this is a case of &quot;good things come in small packages&quot; being real.  It's a very interesting, though controversial book.
B0000542DG|5.0|For the most part, I liked this movie.  There's a good suspense factor that keeps your interest, because you're always wondering who will be next, and speculating how that particular person will die.  A couple of the deaths are sudden, where you didn't even see it coming, while other death scenes are long and full of clues, where you're guessing how it will happen.  It does make you think about death, because there's an emphasis on the reality that it can happen anytime, leaving you with a creepy feeling, so in that way it's very effective.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending, but you'll have to see it for yourself.  Final Destination is one of the better modern teen horror/suspense movies out right now.
0688152023|5.0|What this book WILL do is guide you through an exercise routine that is as challenging and fun as you want to make it.  <br />The exercises are divided into different sections: warm-up, stretches, abdominals, legs, floor barre, and ballet.  There are also sample routines in the back of the book for emphasizing different aspects of fitness: endurance, strength, abs, etc.<br />Each movement is shown step-by-step with written instructions, and almost every one moves your body through motions it is probably not accustomed to doing.  After just the 10-minute stretch, I am already feeling energetic and relaxed.  The exercises are fun, often quite challenging, and they accomplish what they claim they will.<br />This book will not make you a ballet dancer ~ one-on-one classes are irreplaceable for that.  But using the exercises contained in it will supplement your dancing (or any other activity you're involved with!) by making your body stronger and more graceful.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I really loved this CD.  I bought it just for &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;  but the rest of it is great also!   1) Affirmation - I really like this one, take the time to read the lyrics, they are really cool and I think its a great start to the CD 2) Hold me - A really good song, sounds good after the fast paced Affirmation 3) I knew you Loved me - Almost everyone has heard this one, nice and slow and really fabulous song 4) The best thing - I really liked this one, its got a really nice beat that just makes you want to dance 5) Crash and Burn - I really like this song, its the reason I bought the CD!   6) Chained to you - Worked really well after the slower song of Crash and Burn, keeps the flow of the CD going, this is one that really makes you want to hum it or sing or something!  :-D 7) The Animal Song -This one turned out to be my favorite in the whole entire thing.  This is really cool, it has a awesome beat and I just love the lyrics! 8) The lover after me - This is cool, it makes me kinda sad when I hear the lyrics and everything but its really cool. 9) Two bed and a coffee machine - I think this is where the cd gets a little boring, they are all slow after it but this song is good, the lyrics have a real meaning. 10) You can still be free - Another slow song, but it is good nothing too special though 11) Gunning down romance - Good, not one of my personal favorites but its still good. 12) I don't know you anymore - I really like this one, I think its a really good end to the cd, its slow but not too slow you really end up paying attention to the lyrics.<br />I would really say that you should buy this CD, its really good I think you would really enjoy it! :-D
B000002MG1|5.0|I listened to this album just last night and was amazed all over again by what beautiful music it is.  AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE starts out by tossing aside mainstream success in &quot;Drive&quot; (first lyrics: &quot;Hey, kids, rock and roll&quot;).  &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; really sets the pace and mood of the album, with its tale of a man dying peacefully. (Of all things, it's happy.  Go figure.)  &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; is more traditional REM fare, a guitar-driven jam about the the urban jungle.  Then comes &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, a song even a true cynic couldn't dismiss as too sentimental.  The instrumental jam is one of the best anywhere, as it stands well on its own and fits the album perfectly to boot.  The orchestral arrangements in &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; are perfect, epic without being overblown like too many other bands'.  &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; harkens back to old REM, with oblique lyrics and a great melody.  Then comes &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, a politically minded rocker.  &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot; (not the real lyrics) is the weakest track, but is still enjoyable.  We've all heard &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, and I for one will never get tired of it.  However, the album's real gem is &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, an absolutely beautiful piano-driven piece.  When the album closes with &quot;Find the River&quot;, one feels almost overwhelmed by the beauty experienced.  In summary, I can't possibly describe the profundity of this great, great album.  You will not regret owning this.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Like this guy Joshua below, who also gave Seven Samurai a single star, please...  Even if *you* don't like it, doesn't mean it deserves a single star.<br />Lets add it up...<br />On the technical side of you have some of the most stunning animation ever made.  Not only that but lovingly restored and looking better than ever, THX certified.  One Star.<br />Sound effect were hollywood action movie quality, and music was highly original, and has not aged like some soundtracks or scores do.  One star.<br />Like Blade Runner before it, Akira is a film that has changed cinema.  Though felt more in animation, Akira still has had an impact in  mainstream films.  For that reason, that it is piece of history, it should be recognized.  People that attack it, saying that it's over hyped, we should ask them if they like Star Wars.  SW should get credit for it's cultural impact, regardless of objective quality, and so their point is moot.  Bad or good, genius or flawed, it has changed people.  One more star.<br />So even if you hate it, this DVD edition should be getting at least three stars, not to mention some super cool extra's on the second disc.  Those of us who enjoyed the movie, will of course factor in that and give it more stars.
0671646788|5.0|This book should probably be read every two or three years.  It's a wonderful, effective motivational tool.  It stresses finding success, happiness and peace of mind at the level you believe that you can achieve.  Although THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG has been deemed a management tool, it could also be a personal development and life skills textbook because it works on the mind, not just the business.<br />According to the author, the differences between the successful people and others include confidence and positive thinking and reinforcement.  <br />You actually feel empowered and worthy after you've read this.  These are powerful concepts.  I highly recommend this book
B000000OR9|5.0|Of all the mistakes Geffen will make over the years,not marketing Blue Murder properly and letting them get away will surely be one of their biggest. Having first heard this album some 11 years ago in 1989 it is still my favourite album. The entire album is one classic melodic rock tune after the other. From the intro and first song`Riot` the guitars and vocals of John Sykes grab you and take you through some of the best written and arranged songs to appear on a `metal` album. The heavy rock of `Billy` to the haunting `Out of love` take you to either end of Sykes`s moods. The fact this band did not do another album is one of the biggest travisty`s ever. A pure classic, if your reading this and wondering wether to spend your money on an album 11 years old all i can is is do it, you will not be dissapointed, after all these years i am still as in love with this album as i was when i first heard it.
0783231032|5.0|1941... if I had a time machine I would love to see how it really was.<br />The movie is awesome; a lot of know talent and &quot;legends&quot; of our time.  Absolutely funny from the moment it starts to the end.<br />As I understand, unfortunately this one was not very popular when it came out.  I have invited friends and family to watch it and they have walked away laughing at all the silliness.<br />For a few good laughs, I highly recommend this one!
B000056VIY|5.0|You have to buy this cd!!! The smooth latin pop sounds of jennifer lopez make this cd the absolute best! Love Dont Cost a Thing, Im Real, and Play are the best songs she'z ever come out with. The entire cd is great, except for number 7...which is just dumb
B00004X01U|4.0|I've really been enjoying how Madonna continues to reinvent herself CD after CD. The only surprise I found with this CD is that there is only 10 tracks on it. The CD is full of dance tracks with an occasional slow mix. Great CD for cruising in the car.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead is still quite a popular band but in a good way.  What I mean is that MTV does not screw up their career by overplaying their songs on TRL, and they were recently guests on South Park in what I must say was a very funny episode. Anyway, on to the CD, this album is a pleasant return to rock and roll for Radiohead after putting together a mostly electronica album in Kd A, an album which is overall good but probably my least favorite among my collection of Radiohead albums (I own all albums except Pablo Honey).  The opening track is brilliant, but makes you feel as if this CD will be another &quot;Kid A&quot;, not so my friend.  The opener is followed by their current single, and a well-done &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot;  I am not going to blab on about each single track but my favorites would have to be  You and Whose Army, I Might Be Wrong, Knives Out, and Morning Bell Amnesiac.  For those who complain that Radiohead has gone downhill from OK Computer, I would totally disagree, Radiohead is using a smart strategy that U2 used, shy from your traditional rock sound, experiment with different sounds, and then return back to your traditional rock sound.  Radiohead should eventually release another Bends or OK Computer-like CD in the near future if they are following the same musical course as U2.
B000001FN3|5.0|I didn't had the chance to hear this new version of the original vynil master but i hope so  it fits my expectations. I'd like to know if there's a CD version of the original recording, including the picture in front of  album.
0783226845|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies....<br />This is definitely a \\"feel good movie\\", one in which the hero has a tragic past with a \\"pre-determined\\" future, but due to the twists of life...  it changes for the better.<br />I highly recommend this movie.  If you ever have a nasty day, you'll feel much better once you finish watching this.
B00000INEX|5.0|We have Baby Bach and Baby Mozart, and Baby Bach is definitely my 11-month-old's favorite! She is captivated by all the music and activity and the pace really holds her interest. <br /> I agree that the dragon puppet at the beginning was startling to her when she first watched the tape -- but once she got used to it, it didn't even faze her and I think she actually finds it entertaining now. Maybe watch it with your child the first few times and give her a chance to get used to it.<br /> I find it interesting that other reviewers have complained about the segments featuring Julie Aigner-Clark's children -- my daughter is very interested in other children and really enjoys those parts.<br /> I highly recommend both Baby Bach and Baby Mozart -- it's a delight to see my baby get so much enjoyment out of watching them.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Its good to see a good band that is still putting out some amazing music. Personally I think this is one of the best albums to come out recently. Some people dont like the album because it doesnt conatin numerous radio hits like ten or vitology but radio play isnt everything. I own all of pearljams studio albums excluding no-code (witch I will soon be purchaseing) and this isnt my favorite album but a good album none the less. There is some truely great tracks on this record and I suggest it to anyone who likes good music.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Clint Eastwood is just the tip of the iceburg of great songs on this album.  This CD proves that thoughtful music can also be fun (a not so subtle dig at Radiohead).
0553573403|5.0|when you pick up this book. I found it fascinating,delectable and mostly riveting! Martin kept my attention the whole book and I had to force myself to put it down. It is well conceived and written. This one will keep up at night. ....The down side if there is one, is the number of characters. There is an Appendix that has the different Lords houses listed and who is related to whom. That is very helpful.
0316286443|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin is a fantastic makeup artist.  A true artist who understands the canvas of the female face.  I am a professional photographer and most of the time I also do the makeup on my models.  Kevyn's book has opened up so many more ideas for me on how I can create a mood with how I apply the makeup to models. I highly recommend this book.  I also have his other book Making Faces ( this book is just as fantastic)
B00005B602|5.0|Since I saw this movie in France in May, it has kept me up at night, haunting me with bursts of joy and this insane desire to see it again. Even if you haven't been lucky enough to see this breathtaking film, get the soundtrack. My mother hasn't seen Amelie, and the music brought her to tears. Worth the money, worth ten times this much...
B000059MEK|5.0|This is a partial responce to another review talking about how the cd is a sell-out.  &quot;HAHA&quot; i say!  This cd is brilliant! They must not have gotten the joke.  To fully appreaciate this cd you MUST see the music videos.  Enough reading not enough buying!
B00003CX8J|4.0|This movie would have gotten 5 stars except for one thing....not enough action.  Like most new-era comicbook movies, the characters actually looked like themselves.  Their super powers were acurate.  Also, major comic book plot points were kept in, to provide some sense of continuity.  If only all these elements were combined with mondblowing action.  Sure the final battle scene was cool and long, but what else was there?  <br />Aside from this, the movie was very good.  Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) is destined to become a big star.  Also, Patrick Stewart in a role he was born to play (wink,wink) Director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) helmed what could easily be called the definitive superhero movie of the new century!
B00000373U|5.0|I have this rule about buying a record. I have to hear at least two songs from it that I really like before I'll buy a copy for myself. Granted, that rule doesn't always act as law. If an artist I really love comes out with something new, I'll buy it no questions asked. If I see a band live and now that I'm already in love with their music, I'll give it a try as well. The great thing about Elliott Smith's Either/Or, is that all three of those criteria were swiftly met even before I had the album. I would spend a full [price] (a.k.a. scary retail price) for this one, simply for the songs Between the Bars and Say Yes. Everything else I've heard of Smith's I love, and his live show is, of course, wonderful.<br />Either/Or is my favorite Elliott Smith album.. definitely worth the money you're thinking of spending on it right now. I would definitely go for it.
006019250X|5.0|I loved this book.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until it was finished.  It struck a marvelous chord in my Middle-eastern psyche.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|I love horror movies. I remember loving this movie when it came out. When I finally wore out my VHS copy of Evil dead and brought it on DVD, I noticed that the DVD made the effects more obvivous. It doesn't make it any less of a cult film though. I still love it. Plus the DVD came with lots of great extras.
6305508550|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite movies, and it was a real shame that it was so over looked at the box office.  Our hero Peter Gibons just another faceless drone working for Intitech.  So disillusioned is he in fact that his cubicle looks as if he just started that day.  After a freak hypnosis accident Peter no longer cares about his job, his cheating girlfriend, or in fact anything at all.  Least of all his Boss Lumberg. Peter, and friends hatch a plan to rip off the company since they are all being fired anyway. The movie is far from academy award faire, but it is a fun 90 mins.  It includes many situations that even though are &quot;funnied up&quot; are still pretty close to the average drone's day.  My job is similar so I can totally relate to Peter, and Michael, and that other guy who no one can seem to pronounce his name.  Stephen Root steals the show as Milton who was the star of several animated shorts entitled 'Milton' shown on Saturday Night Live that was the original basis of this movie.  A fun movie, and proof that Every Drone Has Its Day!!! enjoy.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Let's start this off: I did not buy this cd while in my right mind. I thought I should get a few &quot;popular&quot; cds (as opposed to extremely popular GOOD music i.e. nfg, the ataris, etc.. what was I thinking??) for the use @ parties etc. I did not buy this b/c I liked Britney, and the investment was idiotic. I simply cannot believe the nerve of Ms. Spears. The fact that she considers herself an ARTIST baffles me. Or does she? It certainly does not seem like it. Okay, if she wants to flaunt dance moves, let her, but don't let her make music. The &quot;singer&quot; simply has no talent whatsoever. Her &quot;music&quot; is trash, stuff for carnivals and other loud places where it can be sufficiently drowned out.  However, being that this review will presumably be posted on the &quot;oops I did it again&quot; cd info page, I will have to assume that pop lovers will be reading this review, and doubtless will not be swayed. Okay, I'll say it. If you love bad music, you'll love this. So go out and buy it right now. In fact, buy a signed copy. Then you'll waste your money even more!
B00005K3OT|5.0|I didnot think that Chocolat would be a good movie, I didnot bother to watch it even after the Oscars, finally this past month I saw it, it was delightful, simple, fresh and sweet. I needed to see something like Chocolat to remind me that happy endings movies are still my favorites. The movie is a gem, the music is great and I can not wait for the DVD to come out so I will have the movie to watch over and over again.
B00000K413|4.0|I first heard TFF via the Mad World video with Roland doing his &quot;can't dance to save my life&quot; routine at the end of a pier.  I always thought it was strangely in tune with the muscial style so that didn't worry me.  <br />This album contains IMHO the best TFF singles in Mad World, Pale Shelter and Change.  Although the singles from the second were undoubtedly more successful worldwide, the blend of synth and acoustic guitar on this album raises it above SFTBC.<br />The booklet explains that the duo used their love of a pyschotherapist called Janov to shape the lyrical tone of their songs.  Nearly 20 years later, I can see this theme running through the songs, but I was 15 when this came out and was only interested in synth music (I'm not a great lyrical analyser).<br />This album contains a few remixes, most OK, but also throws on non-album single The Way You Are.  Curt seems to think that the intricate rhythms were just trying to be clever and that's why the song didn't have the success of those previous (albeit on second asking).  The drum rhythms are very clear on the re-mastered CD, it's not the rhythms that are at fault here - it's just that the song is incredibly weak compared to everything-else on this CD.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece of sounds.  There is something so familiar about Dido's wonderfully lyrical voice, that many people have told me that she sounds like someone they recognize, and ultimately, I think that Dido reminds us of what the sound of good music is.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'VE OWNED THIS CD FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW AND INITIALLY THE BEST RATING I COULD GIVE IT WAS A 3...AND THAT WAS STRETCHING IT...AND THEN ONE DAY ABOUT A WEEK AGO I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED...THIS IS ABOUT ONE OF THE BETTER CD'S I OWN...FORGIVE ME INDIA...I WAS FOOLISH; YOU JUST HAD TO GROW ON ME IS ALL.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is this band's best rock album.  No Code is probably their best album musically and lyrically, but it fails in being hard rock.  This does not.  From the opening &quot;Last Exit&quot;, with one of P.J.'s best drum tracks, to &quot;Immortality&quot;, this album does not let up.  Sure, &quot;Pry, to&quot; and &quot;Aye Davanita&quot; are strange, but they don't slow the album down.  They just give you a chance to breathe (notice that those 2 songs are followed by &quot;Corduroy&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot; respectively).  <br />Look at the first 3 songs--&quot;Last Exit,&quot; &quot;Spin the Black Circle,&quot; and &quot;Not For You.&quot;  3 quintessential Pearl Jam hard rock songs.  I dare anyone to name an 90's rock album that has 3 better opening songs.  &quot;Tremor Christ,&quot; with it's Beatle-esque melody (okay, it's a rip off of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, but it still works), offers some of Ed's best vocals up to that time.  <br />And let's not forget about maybe the 2 best songs on the album.  &quot;Nothingman&quot; and &quot;Betterman&quot; are 2 of Pearl Jam's most popular, most requested, and most praised songs.  &quot;Whipping&quot; is another straight out rocker, and &quot;Satan's Bed&quot; offers one of the funkiest beats you'll ever hear from the band.  <br />&quot;Bugs,&quot; which consists of only Ed and an accoridan, is one of the strangest songs you'll ever hear on a rock album, but is amusing and does have some interesting subtext when you think about the band at that point in their history.  <br />The only real criticism of the album is the last track, titled either &quot;Stupid Mop&quot; or &quot;Heyfoxymophandlemama, that's me.&quot;  Basically, it consists of 2 children talking about suicide and abuse over whirling guitars and some music that's just plain dark.  A failed experiment.  But pop in this disc, start at track 1, and play up through track 13, and you may never hear anything like it again.  A must for any 90's rock fan.
6305648522|4.0|Always smooth flowing and fresh, where appropriate: heart-warming/wrenching.  The energy and beauty that sweats from this movies's pores is like nothing you will have seen.  Emotionally it bears similarities with American Beauty. But it runs rings around that film for the people in Cinema Paradiso are real. <br />The story is simple and universally relatable, I'm sure you've read about it in other reviews, but to me it is a story of nostalgia.<br />This is one of those films (movies for me are a different breed altogether) where intellectual appreciation is second place to emotional resonance and it pays.  <br />I don't like talking about Directors' stylistics, lets say Tornatore's camera work matches the thematical and emotional requirements of the material perfectly.<br />The acting is genuine and heartfelt, nobody cares about how they look, its whats under the surface of these people that counts...what makes up their souls.  For me an important theme of the film.<br />Unfortunately the ending didn't work for me.  There were no loose ends to tie up because there were never any ends at the beginning of the 3rd act, it was the charm that kept me watching. Although the ending gushed with it, I just shrugged disappointed at the lack of rosebud.  <br />But it was worth buying, and a valued member of my collection.
0553106635|5.0|This is by far the best series I have ever read.  The characters are so complex and so full that that could easily be real.  I even skipped work when the third book came out just so I could sit and read all day.
0312954468|5.0|When I first started reading this book I disliked Taita because he thought so highly of himself.  I nearly put the book aside!  But boy am I glad I kept with it.  Taita is without a doubt one of my all time favorite characters now!  The story line is wonderful.  The main characters are well thought out and are self motivated based on their own character development / quirks.  Some of the sub-characters are a bit cookie-cutter but that doesn't detract from the pleasure of the story.  Overall, I loved this book and now that I'm done reading it I find myself wanting more.  Next is The 7th Scroll for sure.
B000006NPY|5.0|This CD is awesome.  I love listening to it, because it's great for many moods.  It pumps me up when I'm working on things, but it also can soothe me when I feel sad or angry.  The music is all together great -- one of those cds that you can listen to all the way through, and not skip over any bad songs.  I love it!
B000022TT4|5.0|This movie was really good...I didn't buy it to learn about U2's past (get U2 at the End of the World or something for that), but to hear them sing. And that's exactly what I got. While Rattle and Hum has some of U2's best songs (Bullet the Blue Sky, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Angel of Harlem, and Bad), I was dissapointed to find out that All I Want is You plays during the credits. That's one of the songs that got my into U2 in the first place, and I was hoping I would see them perform it. Oh, well, I'll survive.<br />Definetly get this, whether you're new to U2 or an old fan.
0375703861|3.0|...unfortunately, it's 448 pages (paperback edition) long.<br />Lots of fine stuff in here.  Zadie Smith obviously has great writing chops.<br />However, something odd occurred in the editing process.  Ummm, namely, the process just didn't happen.  The book has the feel of something that passed directly from Zadie's word processor to my hands.  There are entire chunks of the book, especially in the last 150 pages, that are developed and just never amount to a hill of beans.  An animal-rights protest group thingie (can't think of what else to call it) is particularly maddening.  You could literally excise the whole piece - probably 40 - 50 pages worth of fluff - and the book would read exactly the same.<br />White Teeth is at its best when it focuses on its core characters of Archie Jones and Samed Iqbal.  Around half-way through, Ms. Smith appears to get bored with those two.  Unfortunately for her readers, the novel loses its focus as soon as Samed and Archie fade to the background.  For the last 200 pages, they are presented as mere afterthoughts.<br />To the author's credit, the book is notable for its very impressive range of scholarship on geographies as varied as Jamaica, Bangladesh, North London, and Bulgaria; in addition, topics like Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, genetics, World War II and teenage angst are covered with uncommon skill.  This is no hack writer.  So despite my criticisms here, I look forward to Zadie Smith's next effort.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I've never been to a movie that made me bawl uncontrolably. This one did. It will forever be my all-time favorite movie! Don't pass up an opportunity to see this!!
B00005B36H|4.0|I'll start by saying that it's only a result of my usual musical dispositions that I don't give this album five stars; that is to say, I've a taste for an eclectic variety from Phish to Dave Matthews to Pearl Jam to Radiohead to Dylan to Wu-Tang to Grateful Dead to the Doors to Bob Marley.  Perhaps it's a fairly typical spread for the college student.  As such, I'll admit that a 6:00 AM insomniac viewing of the frighteningly abstract video for &quot;Schism' urged me to give a listen.  And, I was not disappointed. 'Schism' flies as the obvious commercial flagship, inbounds just enough to earn the radio play that it deserves and stir up some zesty capitalist consumerism along the way.  'The Patient' stands out as my chice for the album though. Throughout, the songwriting functions on an epic scale, that is the tempos rise and fall and evolve without the naseating effect of the pop-hook.  The album is an intelligent departure from commercial rock.
0694524786|5.0|I purchased this to listen to on a long drive, and I absolutely love it. This is one of my favorite books, and Michael York does a brilliant job of reading. He uses different voices, tonal inflections for each character and it's absolutely captivating. I highly recommend this as an audio-book!!
B000002A3T|2.0|Do you really think this cd deserves your hard-earned money? I do not think so. I am sorry, but I really think these guys are just using their once-and-still great name, Pink Floyd to make us open our wallets. Their previous album &quot;Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was never bad. But maybe that was their best! Since Roger Waters has left the band, they are not creative anymore. Never! I still remember the day I bought this album. With big hope, and Bamm--. What a disappointment!! I do not know if Roger Waters was really ego mania or something arrogant. But he must have been the real core of Floyd. Sorry again, but you'd better pick up  &quot;Wish you were here&quot; or &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot; first.<br />P.S. Their live albums are still pretty cool.
B00004XQP4|5.0|i cant belive why some people didnt like this cd? it ROCKS i mean it isnt fricken hard core [crud]. it is good music. GET THIS ALBUM. the songs will stay in your head all fricken day.
B000021Y7X|4.0|Let me put this straight. I did not knew Talking Heads when I bought this DVD - and I still don't know very much. But this is simply one of the best performances ever and you shouldn't miss it.<br />I consider it superior to Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" (if it only had a better sound...) - and Bowie's my favourite artist. It's ten times better than most of the shows you'll get to see nowadays, and that was made back in the 80s.
B000001IPL|5.0|this cd is just plain AWESOME. this cd is to good. u will never get bored of. enough of this junk JUST GET IT
0060254920|5.0|No child's library is complete without this story of Max who gets into too much mischief and is sent to his room, only to imagine himself in a far away land where he is king and makes all the rules. I loved it as a child and it is one of my children's favorites too.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Last night, I watched this movie for the 17th time with my cousin. It was her first time seeing it, and she was so scared you wouldnt believe it. As soon as the girl turned around and yelled &quot;ACE OF SPADES!!!&quot; she started screaming in my ear. Then when I had to bring her home, i grabbed her leg and she ran into the car. I was so creeped out when i saw this for the first time. As for the sequels, Dead by Dawn was good, but why the hell would Ash go back to the cabin? and Army of Darkness is so funny. I still can't understand why that one wasn't rated PG-13. I highly recommend the original.
B00004X01U|3.0|madonna returns after &quot;ray of light&quot; with this follow up. &quot;music&quot; incorporates more folky/weird synths with some awesome beats. madonna's vocals on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired. she sounded more free on &quot;ray of light&quot; than on &quot;music&quot;. still it's a good effort and at least madonna keeps pop music fresh. faves are: &quot;music&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;nobody's perfect&quot;, &quot;don't tell me&quot;, and &quot;what it feels like for a girl&quot;.
B0000584V3|4.0|A great change of pace for Opeth:their new opus reveals them as a powerhouse of talent.'Blackwater Park'is a very rare album indeed,and it can even be genre redefining.It is a mesmerising combination of power and weakness,light and shade,an original sonic tapestry,expanding the boundaries of metal into poetry with  powers of cinematic persuasion.
B000006TRV|5.0|As a lot of them Pink Floyd \\"fans\\" (please do note the quotation marks) have pointed out, this album is not DSOTM indeed. Thing is... who said it intended to be like DSOTM in the first place? In my opinion, this is the Floyd's masterpiece, in terms of both songwriting and production. Just LISTEN to it... you'll learn not only to appreciate Pink Floyd, but also good music as a whole. This album is also a lot more accesible than Dark Side Of The Moon or Wish You Were Here (which DOES NOT mean \\"better\\"... IMHO, it's just as good as any of the previously mentioned albums, but more accesible nonetheless). It's a great musical experience really.<br />The Wall is mainly Roger's solo project, granted, but Dave does have a primary role in the project as well. His guitar solos and the couple of songs he got credited for, are wonderful pieces of music. What really makes this record a geniune and ever-lasting gem is the fact that when a genius is given enough time, food for thought, and an out of this planet guitarist/musician, the result is usually a masterpiece. The reason why The Wall is such a wonderful work of rock theatre, is because Waters wrote it almost in its entirety. Give a good listen to both The Division Bell and Amused to Death and you'll understand what I mean. Gilmour is quite talented, an awesome guitarist, and he might be the better musician, but without Roger he is [crud] when it's down to recording music, period. On the other hand, Roger is a wonderful lyricist, songwriter, and quite a decent musician: A legitimate artist indeed. He knows how to write good, deep, quality, lasting music. In other words, the man's an artist and KNOWS how to produce his art. But whereas Roger can do pretty well on his own, if you put Gilmour in the mixture... it's pure magic! And that's what The Wall is all about. (Note that I'm stating all of these things based on studio recordings. Gigs are a different story). Without Roger, this project obviously would've never existed at all... but without David, it would've never been the same either. They are both at their very peak on this album and it shows throughout. They provided what they needed to.. and the result couldn't be any better. It doesn't get any better than this, the record is absolutely brilliant.<br />As for the album itself, it's extremely well connected, coherent, and wonderfully written all in all. To all the people [...] who have claimed that this album is not coherent enough, they've one of the following two issues: Either you suffer from hearing problems, or you cannot read between lines. The Wall's concept is crystal-clear. The problem here is that Pink Floyd's music has always been for smart people who do think and know about GOOD, artistic music. People who can actually listen to the lyrics, understand them, and realize what the concept not only of The Wall, but of The Floyd as a whole is all about. As we all know, not everyone is especially smart. You need to know how to LISTEN... which is music's main point in the first place. Most people forget that these days (Limp Biskit, Marilyn Manson, Christina Aguilera fans... include yourselves here, will you?) Music (real, authentic music that is) is written with the primary purpose for people to really listen to it and understand what it means. And Roger screams precisely that at the top of his lungs on this album. As we all know, it was indeed that very lack of listening from the fans which prompted Roger to write The Wall.<br />So, if you consider yourself someone who likes good music, actually LISTENS to both the lyrics and the music, and are smart enough to understand what \\"Mother should I build a wall?... Hey you, don't tell me there's not hope at all... I've got a strong urge to fly, but I got nowhere to fly to... Where's the feeling gone, will I remember the songs?... Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fears, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers\\" mean altogether, then do yourself a favour and go buy this record. It's amazing, greatly crafted, and you simply won't be able to stop listening for as, with previous Floyd albums as well, you'll discover new things with ever new listen. It's a whole new experience, just as DSOTM is in a class of its own as well. They're two completely different records, but equally meaningful, perfectly produced, and enjoyable. It obviously has the trademark Pink Floyd quality sound and production values. Just LISTEN to it... you'll love this record. And as I pointed out before, you'll also learn to appreciate good music as a whole, not just Pink Floyd. And The Wall is a great starting point, no doubt about that.<br />If you don't qualify as a Pink Floyd listener and need catchy tunes and words that start with an \\"F\\" over and over again, then you know what to buy. Britney Spears sounds a good choice for y'all, doesn't it? Afterall, to you, she's a better songwriter than Roger, Dave, and Paul McCartney together, isn't she?<br />I might write a review in the near future about the overall concept of The Wall, a song analysis, and my very humble opinion on the record's content.<br />Thank You
B000002IZ4|5.0|I've said it before and I'll say it again...Stone Temple Pilots are TREMENDOUSLY underated.  STP sluffed their reputation as alternative wanna-bes with &quot;Purple&quot;.  I'm on my 2nd copy of &quot;Purple&quot;, having worn out my first copy years ago.<br />&quot;Meatplow&quot; blows the roof off the joint right from the get-go, leading to the capitol first single, &quot;Vasoline&quot;.  I'd mention highlights, but EVERY song here is a poppy, hook-laden masterpiece.  Nothing like &quot;Core&quot;, this great record really brought STP into their own.  It's still one of my favorite albums of the nineties.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is one film, I thought I would walk out of...starts slow leading one to believe this will be a real artsy film..BUT WOW, does this film grow on you.  The music is wonderful, the dancing first rate, all wrapped in a love story.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will smile.  A got to see film and my favorite of the year!
6302787297|5.0|Gladiator caught people onto Ridley Scott's cinematic brilliance. Blade Runner set the tone for what to expect from him. Thelma And Louise proved that he can pretty much tackle anything. Ridley is known for his amazing visuals, and his top notch directing.<br />1492: Conquest Of Paradise is indeed one of Ridley's best looking films to date. Gladiator and Blade Runner look spectacular, but consider that Blade Runner required hefty special effects, and Gladiator was made to perfection using digital enhancements and special effects. 1492 on the other hand while using maybe some weather effects and filters is pure in the sense that it uses little effects and is almost certainly genuine. Yet the visuals we see are amazing and breathtaking. Ridley Scott aces all of his new world elements.<br />What frustrates me is that 1492: Conquest Of Paradise is hardly recognized for it's cinematic brilliance. Gerard Depardieu who plays Christopher Columbus plays his character to perfection. A very thoughtful and complex performance from Depardieu. At times 1492: Conquest Of Paradise hits you like a poem. It is in many ways the story of dreams and believing in things that others say are impossible. In time maybe people who watch 1492: Conquest Of Paradise will come to realize just how thoughtful and amazing it truly is.
0553106635|5.0|This book, and the previous two accomplish something I have long waited for in the fantasy genre; they bring realism to the story.  The characters are simply fantastic.  The story is absolutely plausible in every aspect (given the rules the author has set up).  Unlike most fantasy books, no character in these books are simply black or white, good or evil.  They behave as you would expect a flawed human being to behave; well within the grey areas.  Besides the wonderful characterization of people in the book, the story is willing to take chances.  Characters are killed off.  This helps to create drama and suspense that doesn't really exist in other books, because no one here is really safe.  The uncertain fate of each character is bolstered by the fact that no character is a primary protagonist.  Martin lets the reader decide who to like.  Finally, Martin is a skilled writer.  I've read books with fine story lines, but with less accomplished writers.  The result is an interesting story that is painful to read.  Such is not the case here.  You will fly through the thousand pages of each book.  Beware however, because no other fantasy book that I have found yet can live up to the gold standard that Martin has set.  Nonetheless, its worth the disappointment in others to experience the greatness here.
B000002Q88|3.0|After 'Drastic Measures' and 'Power', I was one of many Kansas fans who threw up our hands and said, &quot;Without Kerry or Robbie, there is no Kansas&quot; and wandered off in search of something worth listening to.  As a result, I missed 'In the Spirit of Things'...a pity it's taken me all these years to remember how good a writer Steve Walsh can be,and how talented the other band members are.  But I must proclaim 'In The Spirit of Things' to be a fine album,especially by today's standards.  True, it does have a definate '80s sound,but Kansas takes a lot of material from outside sources and makes it their own.  'One Man,One Heart' might be the kind of song that Survivor would've done,but it's a solid pop-rock song that Walsh makes his own.  'Ghosts' is wonderfully haunting,and--I'm going to go out on a limb here--'Rainmaker' is one of the best songs from ANY Kansas album; that one alone is worth the price of admission--a mini-masterpiece of the sort that was prevalent on 'Point of Know Return',but with with the sombre tones of a 'Song For America' track.  I've spent many years revering Kerry Livgren's contributions to Kansas; with 'In the Spirit of Things', Steve Walsh steps out from behind Livgren's shadow.  This is a good '80s rock album as well as a concept album; the concept is loose enough to where tracks can be enjoyed individually,and nothing 'art-y' is done to interfere with the music.  If more concept albums were like this,they might be more accessible to people.      At worst,my friends,this album is just as good as a Streets album--a vehicle for Steve Walsh's vocal talents.  While he's not the young man from 'Song For America',he works well with the material here.  This is a must-buy for the Steve Walsh affeciannado, and to all my fellow Kansas fans, let me say; I was wrong.  Kansas can be Kansas even without Kerry Livgren,and this album proves it.  So snatch it up,already!  And thanks to all who posted their reviews here...it made take the risk that has payed off for me...Thanks!
0393312836|3.0|I read this book expecting to be blown away.  1984 blew me away. This book was touted as in the same vein as that book.  It's not.  The book makes some observations about free will, and the nature of good and evil, but I don't find them to be very profound.  Also, in this book the protagonist uses slang that the author has created. This adds little to the story, and wears thin upon the reader after many pages.  In conclusion, this book probably just couldn't live up to the hype.  The reviews on this book make it out to be more than what it is.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is one of those disc's that when you put it on, people will ask what it is. Tourist combines the best stuff of electronic beats and down tempo techno with awesome 50-60's style jazz riffs. Sure, this has been down before, but never so well, nor ever so flawlessly. Each track just bubbles on and on and before you know it, your tapping our feet or bobbing your head. I saw St. Germain when I went out to California, and the mix of people grooving with them was as eclectic as the sounds on this disc. Truely wonderful stuff. Some highlights for me include the very dance-floor &quot;Rose Rouge&quot;, &quot;So Flute&quot; and the terrific opener that will set the pace for any get-together. With both chilled out lounge flavors and upbeat bossa nova, this is a definite must own!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After I saw the movie, I rushed out to buy the soundtrack! I was so happy that they included several songs sung by Nicole Kidman and (SIGH!) Ewan McGregor! (I love men that sing!) Too bad they left out some of them....Guess we'll have to all buy the movie when it comes out! This movie and soundtrack was the pick-me-up that made my summer. I still can't get the songs out of my head. People were actually singing along in the theater(The Elephant Love Medley is the BEST song!!!!) It almost reminded me of the Rocky Horror picture show in spirit, but was so much better.(All the theatrical/bohemian LOVE*TRUTH*BEAUTY stuff) I highly recomend buying this soundtrack. It will help you remember the color and fun of the movie, not to mention the romance, which is what summer is all about! It has also made me a huge fan of Mr. McGregor, who shines brilliantly in this movie. He is wonderful and so romantic. I have an new appreciation for him and have even gone back and watched movies that I'd seen before and loved them even more. (I already knew that Kidman was amazing, and she doesn't let you down!) I hope everyone enjoys this CD as much as I did!
B000003CMB|5.0|Everyone has a favorite album, the one that they think is better than anything else. Often people spend their time searching for superlatives with strength enough to describe their choices, and often those choices appear unthinkable to others. But, to use the words of Jim Morrison in a horrendously out of context setting, &quot;People are strange.&quot; This is without a doubt the best live album i've ever heard. The slide fills that open &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; are forever etched in my memory. It simply sounds as if the Lord himself slipped in the back door of the Fillmore East that night with a Les Paul and the broken neck of a bottle of cough syrup. &quot;Whipping Post&quot; and &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; have more brilliant guitar work than one can comprehend in a single sitting. The expanded &quot;Fillmore Concerts&quot; edition is good for the purpose of getting a full historical view of the shows, but if you want the true experience, buy this album, drink a pot of coffee, stay up 'til midnight, put this one on, and prepare to be amazed.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Look at me, I'm beaming.  I've always have loved the Beatles, but have been saddened by the lack of press about them over the years (happens when your group has been broken up since 1969).  Now, to my delight, the Beatles released this monster hit!  Unfortunately, unlike the Anthology Series, there's nothing new here.  Not only is there nothing new, but these timeless hits aren't even remixed (unlike Yellow Submarine, which I die and go to heaven every time I hear it).  <br />The packaging is gorgeous, but not really worth the price of the CD.  <br />All in all, a dissappointment.  But yet, gosh, we creamed the competition on this one!  Good going, boys!
B000001Y2U|2.0|this release has about three good songs and that's it.do yourself a favor and buy their&quot;Portrait Of An American Family&quot;cd and hear some real damage!
B00001IVOR|4.0|Double rap albums are usually long-winded self-indulgent affairs. But then again, the Wu-Tang aren't your usual rap group. We're talking about the Wu-Tang Clan, a conglomeration of some of the best MCs to ever grace the microphone helmed by a producer of ingenious proportions - the RZA. Remember that irrefutable masterpiece Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) that came roaring out like of the underground, slashing and biting? It hit hard and quick - BAM, BAM, BAM!  Like the grace and viciousness of martial art fighting, Wu-Tang Clan combined the mystique of sparse minimalist beats with savage lyricism. But while, Enter the Wu-Tang was characterized by guerilla style attacks, Wu-Tang Forever is the group's manifesto drawn out to epic scope, unfolding slowly like a sepia-toned cinematic tale of inner city life.  In this, the group sacrifices  impact for the overall effect. If it's one thing that Wu-Tang Forever suffers from, its over ambition. But you can hardly blame a group for such a fault. Criticize a rap artist for turning out a cheap cash-in, criticize a rap artist for stuffing a double album up to its neck in filler - but Wu-Tang Forever is neither. Wu-Tang Forever takes artistic chances with RZA fleshing out some of the most captivating soundscapes ever heard in the rap world.  Look at the song &quot;Reunited&quot; - where violins wail gypsy-style changing tempo and building up into a climactic frenzy. It's classic Wu at its best. Lyrically, the entire album crackles with the same passionate furious  energy of their debut album. Over the spread of four years, the group members have developed distinct personas and defined their rapping style. On Wu-Tang Forever, each member really comes into their own, exchanging rapid gunfire worldplay with experience and ease, playing off each others strengths and weaknesses. All rules and logic argue that with such large individual egos in play, it would tear the group apart but rather it tightens it into a sleeker method of attack. The song &quot;Triumph&quot; is the best example of this with all the group members passing the mics as torrents of lyricism follow each other with relentless power. The Wu-Tang Clan is such a tightly knit combination of talent it seems difficult to ever take them down. Even when RZA's beats and productions don't hit the mark, the MCs carry the song through. And vice versa. There are a few times when both counterparts fail such as Black Shampoo and Maria. But these are minor complaints because even the throwaways work beautifully within the context of Wu-Tang Forever. Check out &quot;For Heaven's Sake&quot; with a trademark stomping militant chorus come-on and its quirky nasal female flourishes. &quot;Visionz&quot; features eerie piano chords tip-toeing along dark alleys and ducking within shadows. Speaking of vision, there's plenty of it on Wu-Tang Forever with the group contributing to the anti-mainstream rap cause and calling for social reform. And while a few times, the group's vision errs (i.e. the condemnation of evolution), nonetheless it remains refreshing and interesting compared to their middle-of-the-road peers. Take Wu-Tang Forever piece by piece, listening to the entire album in one sitting is a feat I myself  have not even accomplished. The album is meant to be enjoyed in measured listenings but the overall effect at the end is more rewarding than any hip-hop album I have heard yet.
B000001Y5X|5.0|this cd is their best release period. it's so brutal and dark, every song has damaging lyrics. a complete mind trip. it's sick and i love it.
B00005AXEL|2.0|Here are 13 new songs, but unfortunately they mostly sound the same.  I wish Stevie had a more inspired set of band members to accompany her.  They just don't give her much to work with.  There are not many musicians in the world that can write the lyrics, sing the songs and compose the music and come up with a great CD.  Stevie isn't a one-person band and this CD relies too much on her voice to keep your attention.  The band just stays in the background and adds nothing to Stevie's effort. The result is a repetitive and a lackluster CD.
0140288503|5.0|What made this book so exciting for me was I know one of the soliders mentioned in the book.  The book reads like a novel.  It's hard to put the book down. I vaguely remember these events in the news -- but I now know that there was more to the story.  This is a must for any American patriot.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|This musical was an incredible blend of great acting and beautiful singing. Kidman's and Mcgregor's stunning voiced blend together to make this movie one of the best I have ever seen. I had no idea how beautiful Mcgregor could sing. As he began his first song, the entire audience fell completely silent, mouths open and the sheer beauty of his voice. Incredible. Ewan needs to release a CD. <br />Although the beginning was choppy and a bit confusing, it clears up near the end. The mix of redone songs was great... The way the actors liltingly change the original tunes is breathtaking. As I exited the theatre after the showing, I spotted a ... ..., and bought the soundtrack, which I wholehartedly reccomend.

0553212737|5.0|Because of its popularity, I believe the literary merits of &quot;Emma&quot; are perhaps overlooked.  So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters.  &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female.
B000006MS3|5.0|LONDON: September 1982, Kate Bush releases her new album, The Dreaming. The Essex Recorder sends its Music Editor, Freddy Frobisher, down to London for an exclusive preview of the new material. He gave us this special report, after we managed to coax him down from the tree. The dialogue comes to you from the Royal Psychiatric Hospital For The Recently Perplexed.<br />&quot;My G-G-God, I'm still shaking. I'm buzzing. I'm tingling. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I've never heard anything like it. Its gonna haunt me for the rest of my days, I just know its g-g-gonna haunt me.&quot; Take deep breaths Freddy, relax. &quot;It started off with a pounding and dramatic number - a real tour de force, then this quirky song about some bank robbery. That was nice - that was okay - I could cope with that. Then she g-g-got to work on me.&quot; Stop there Freddy. Nurse, could you have the valium on standby please. Carry on Freddy. &quot;It got more and more unsettling - stuff about jungle war, stuff about the Aborigines, stuff about aerophobia, stuff about Houdini for God's sake, and that grand finale... argh! argh! argh! I can't get the sound of those braying donkeys out of my head! Nurse, valium!&quot; Cool it Freddy, just take it easy. You'll be okay. &quot;Okay? I'll have to sleep with the lights on for weeks.&quot;<br />&quot;It was crazy. It was dark. It was scary. It was like a thundering ghost train with that banshee's unearthly voice squealing and screaming in my ears. But it was exhilarating - it was awesome - it invoked an intense reaction in me - no music has done that to me before. When it finished the guys at EMI had to peel me off the ceiling. Oh my God, I want more, I want to experience that rush again. Nurse, give me back my headphones. I said give 'em back! Oi! They're mine... give 'em back!&quot;<br />As the nurse pelted down the corridor, wearing Freddy's headphones, The Dreaming pounding in her ears, it was time to leave. Poor Freddy hasn't been shaken like this since we put him on that roller coaster in Blackpool. In releasing The Dreaming, Kate Bush has opened a Pandora's Box full of the most beguiling and bewitching music, and its to her credit. Kate Bush, from everyone here at the Essex Recorder, we thank you. Freddy sends his regards too - or at least he will when they prise him off the nurse's back.like this since we put him on that roller coaster in Blackpool.

0385334206|4.0|Perhaps not revered by literary scholars quite to the extent of &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; or &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; in the hearts of Vonnegut fans (so far as I can tell) &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is just as beloved.  It is not difficult to see why: for an author known for his bizarre humor, it is perhaps Vonnegut's most bizarre and his most humorous.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some members of the younger generation scoff at anyone who listens to The Beatles. Those people form a small minority, a group of people who simply haven't developed enough mentally to be able to appreciate this music. The Beatles were without a doubt the greatest rock band in history, and as musicians, they rank only slightly lower than such greats as Beethoven and Mozart. Almost every band that ever existed has at least one or two good songs; the best of them may have six or seven good songs throughout their entire existence. The Beatles average something like nine or ten good songs--not across their entire history, but across each of their albums. That's a phenomenal achievement, especially since they pumped out awesome albums like that for nearly a decade, almost as if they were some kind of otherworldly musical assembly line.<br />Enough time spent glorifying The Beatles--they don't need it. Their songs speak for themselves, and this CD is an excellent collection of some of their best work. Sure, a few great songs and a ton of good songs are missing from this compilation--but how could you possibly cram all of The Beatles' best songs onto just a single CD, or even two or three or four? Hell, tracks such as Hey Jude, She Loves You, I Want to Hold Your Hand, and Let It Be would be enough to make me buy this. The fact that the other included songs are so good just made me pull out the cash from my wallet that much faster.<br />In short... buy this CD!
0679731725|5.0|I've cried over, maybe, 4 books that I've read in my life and I've found that the recurring theme in these books is missed chances, risks not taken, regrets, and lost youth.  Our main character, butler Stevens, has all of these and more to contend with as he takes a trip and looks back on his life.<br />Stevens is traveling to another part of England to see if he can persuade a former housekeeper to return to Darlington Hall.  He has spent his life denying his own needs with confidence that his service to his employer will have farther-reaching importance in the outcome of world events than one would assume butlering would have.  Even in asking to take this trip he is denying his own needs by combining it with a task that will benefit his employer (or, so this is how he presents it).  In reality, a part of what causes him to look back and evaluate his life is the fact that he may be, finally, moving forward toward one of the things that he denied himself in the past -- the housekeeper.<br />And you feel a simmering bitterness that, he, as an English butler, would never express, quietly bubbling below his reveries of the service he provided to Darlington Hall and the faith he placed in Lord Darlington that his sacrifices were well worth it.  Stevens felt that to involve himself in the politics of his employer would detract from his butlering.  He chose to believe that Sir Darlington's political activities within Darlington Hall were to have a positive outcome in the peace between nations and that his blind service to Lord Darlington and his many &quot;activist&quot; guests would help to bring this peace about.<br />As he drives toward one of his &quot;sacrifices&quot; he finally &quot;sees&quot; the things that he blinded himself to regarding his employer.  He is no longer confident that he made his sacrifices to a &quot;great cause&quot;.  In fact, he is discovering that the blinders he placed to himself grew very strong and it may be too late to reverse the outcome they have had on HIS life.they have had on HIS life.

Though the solution to her maxxed credit cards was a bit over-simplified, Rebecca Bloomwood could still sit at the table with Bridget Jones for adorable neurosis.
B000059MEK|5.0|I bought this CD yesterday after hearing both &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; on the radio. I can easily say that this will be the new favorite of my CD collection, some people find Daft Punk's music repetitive but I find it refeshingly new. The songs are all different and all have a beat you can dance to. Forget what some of the other people say that gave this CD 1 star, those are the people that listen to people strum a guitar to near death and scream into a microphone and call _that_ music. Buy this CD, you won't regret it.
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere is my favorite book of all time.  We meet an ordinary man who is taken to another world, The London Underground.  Here, nothing is what it seems, and his experiences are gripping because the characters involved are so believable, though fanciful.  And the ending is just as good, giving the reader an overwhelming sense of completion, while still wanting more.
B000001E7V|5.0|This Cd is perfect. Tricky is one of the best artist, and this cd mixes hip-hop, trip-hop, even rock and other genres into one unique sound that IS Tricky. This CD has a song for any and every mood. I am an avid listener to hip-hop and trip-hop and Tricky is my favorite.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Let's just look at it for what it is, Green day writes really good tunes, and this album is no different. Musically they are pushing their own abilities, testing the bounds of their fans, and personaly, I love it. This album has a lot of positive messages, something most older Green Day songs don't have.  Obiviously singels 'Minority' and 'Waiting&quot; are the catchiest, but it's the little things like the harmonica in 'Hold on' and the saxaphone solo in 'Jackass', it's these little things that make this album worthwhile. Not to mention the highly experimental 'Misery' which is one of my favorite tracks.
6300181464|5.0|This was Douglas Trumball's triumph!  He had just finished making 2001 and got on with a specialaized project with Universal to be able to make movies on a fixed budget.  He was able to make a movie that still stands up today as an effects triumph.  Despite his limited budget he was able to make a movie with Robots that I had to see to believe how they were done.<br />The most important thing in this movie is the message.  Earth is a fragile thing and that our resources and space are not limitless nor boundless.  IN the end, we may have forests in little domes in space wondering where we went wrong on earth.  The idea that even these last vestages of life would be destroyed is interesting and considering the present corprate mentality of the bottom line or nothing, is plausable.<br />The logos and advertising by American Airlines and other corporate entities gives the film a realistic flavor.  Trumball did his best to convey that.  Such was present in the use of the Valley Forge, a WWII aircraft carrier that was in the process of being scrapped.  Varous sections of the ship were modified and utilized as set pieces and rooms on a vast spacecraft.  So much so, as a child when I saw this film, I thought they had actualy filmed it on location!<br />This was Trumballs film all the way.  Although Stephen Bochco and others appear as the writing credits, Trumball eventually had to throw out all their writing and write the film himself, but because he was not a member of the Writers Guild, did not get credit for his work.<br />All in all, an excellent film that I hope that todays youth, with their jaded, computer-graphic, perfect mindset, can understand and hopefully see the message that the worst can STILL happen.

6305011575|1.0|I really don't see why everyone thinks this is such a great movie. First of all, the acting is TERRIBLE. The bad acting makes everything seem ten times more fake and ridiculous than it really is. The movie just dragged on and on... It was long, boring, and not at all scary. I only recommend this movie to those who are very easily scared.

B000001FS3|5.0|I usually liked every U2 song I heard on the radio, but I wasn't a &quot;fan&quot; until I heard &quot;The Johsua Tree&quot;.  A friend let me borrow it one night, and I listened to the whole thing, then another friend gave it to me for Christmas. It was an experience, listening to it for the first time, because I'd never really heard many songs from it (or didn't know it when I DID hear them), so I was pretty uninfluenced by the wealth of opinions on it, I based mine on listening to it for the first time, and I absolutely loved it. I'm trying not to sound like everyone else who loved it as I describe it, but I'd never heard anything quite like it, and as I grew more knowledgeable about the band and their history, I began to realize what a unique place &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; really stood in. From the beginning of the album, that atmospheric, warm keyboard drone, there's a kind of passion and sadness that permeates it the whole way through. Every song is powerful. I prefer listening to it all the way through as opposed to one song here and there.  I think it's a sonic tapestry best experienced as a whole. Bono once described their previous studio albumk, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, as out of focus, but WONDERFULLY out of focus, whereas &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is more in focus. It's something that I can actually see between the two. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is thematically the most mature and sophisticated album of their career to date. Bono sings with a poignance that is both joyous AND sorrowful, and The Edge's guitar work is his best up to that point. When it came out, it was something of a mold-breaker for pop music. I had once read that &quot;With or Without You&quot; wasn't considered radio-friendly when the released it as a single. I found that very interesting, since it's a staplel of radio airplay today. &quot;Where the Streets Have No Names&quot; is definitely my personal favorite. Edge's guitar and Larry's drumming evoke a feeling of restlessness and anxiety that really hit home. &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; are simply terrifying, one a protest of American military aggression, the other a descent into madness, both grim and disturbing.  Probably the most mournful is the last track, &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;. At the time I first listened to the album, the nation was reeling from the disappearances of two children, Polly Klass and Cassidy Senter (correct?), and this song seemed to have and extra resonance and importance in light of those incidents. Over-all quite dark, but at the same time hopeful, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is U2 at their pinnacle, a must have for every fan, and music lover in general.
0800177177|3.0|The biggest problem with &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; is that it is manifestly NOT Bram Stoker's DRACULA.  Bram Stoker wrote a book about a monster who views human beings as food.  Francis Ford Coppola made the story about a man simply looking for love, who had the misfortune to be a vampire.<br />In Bram Stoker's DRACULA Mina Harker (nee Murray) was merely a tool used by Count Dracula for revenge when a small band of concerned citizens -- doctors, solicitors, British Lords, and even an American -- united to keep the Count's from turning London, the most cosmopolitan city in the world, into a smorgasbord.  In &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot;, Mina was some sort of cockamamie ancient love of the Count's (none of the backstory Coppola and his people invented make a lick of sense, so we won't delve any deeper into it).<br />In Bram Stoker's DRACULA, an ancient horror was set loose on &quot;modern&quot; London, with its typewriters and phonograph records (if Stoker had written it a hundred years later, it would be the internet and e-mail).  &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; is a period piece that makes fun of the &quot;modern&quot; Victorian era and values that Bram Stoker cherished.<br />Apart from those changes (really, more paradigm shifts that undermine the entire structure and meaning of Stoker's work to an extent that must have him rolling over in his grave), the movie isn't totally unpalatable.  <br />In the book, Abraham van Helsing is a reasonable, educated doctor, whose mind is open enough to accept that vampires exist.  Anthony Hopkins is a frenetic lunatic, but his scenery-chewing is at least amusing.<br />The rest of the cast is mixed, from the incompetent and miscast, to the sublime (Cary Elwes' Arthur Holmwood really was worthy of a better movie, for instance).<br />The movie is loud and frequently over the top, but its blood and thunder was done with such campy panache, it earned the movie my 3-star rating.  Altogether, it's not a bad vampire flick. . . but it's not Bram Stoker's DRACULA.  Read the book.  It's far superior.  To Bram Stoker, Count Dracula was not a rebel who needed to be understood, but a devourer of humans -- a supernatural Jack the Ripper who fed on his victims; and the men and women allied against him had to kill him before they were killed by him.
0441003257|5.0|I read this book about 5 years ago and to this day think \\"Prease to frasten sleet bert\\" when my car dings to tell me to fasten my seat belt.  It was one of the funniest books I have ever read.  I only read it once because I lent it out twice and only got it back once...  I think I'll be getting a new copy now that I've been reminded.<br />This was the first Pratchett or Gaiman book I had read and since then have tried to read books by both authors and tend to favor Gaiman's style for readability.  I find the combination of both authors to be really successful in Good Omens- in Pratchett's individual works he tries to be so amazingly clever with every single sentence that it is wearisome to read.  In this collaboration, though, it is thoroughly funny without beating you over the head with it.<br />The irreverent take on the apocalypse, progress, and religion in general is unforgettably humorous.
0451197879|3.0|A freeway extension is coming through town and causes our main character to lose his house, his job and his mind.  Like other King-as-Bachman books it has the feel of a short story which has been stuffed with repetitive content to make it novel length.  Also, like other Bachman books the plot (what plot there is) is predictable.  Somewhat of an interesting read nonetheless but not a great work.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I don't know that I can add anything that most people have written thus far about the AMAZING Moulin Rouge!  In an age of action and science fiction...it's yesteryear feeling, and transition of classic contemporary songs pulled off this year's most Oscar-worthy film.<br />Ewan McGregor (my new true love) outshines so many of the Hollywood machine players with his sincere and utterly believeable portrayal of Christian.  And Nicole Kidman only improves upon an already spectacular career of daring films.<br />I had never felt so invigorated by a film in so long...I was breathless and anxious throughout, and the music and magic carried me through the film, and out the door as I left the theatre.  I immediately went to the nearest store and purchased the soundtrack...which, needless to say, has been in my car for WEEKS.<br />Long live the Moulin Rouge!  Only France, and more specifically, Paris, could help inspire the most mesmerizing of films.  Bon Jour!
6300263673|5.0|When I first saw Dirty Dancing, I liked it, but I thought it wasn't great. I waited a while to see it again, and I wound up loving it. I guess Dirty Dancing is one of those films that really grows on you. The plot isn't anything much, but it's the music and the dancing that really make the movie. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray, while not really great actors, their chemistry here is undeniable. In fact, this is possibly the best performance that Jennifer Grey has ever given in a movie. Above all, I really recommend this movie to anyone who believes in true love, or loves to dance!<br />The film takes place in the summer of 1963 at a Jewish family resort in the Catskills. Francis &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a young girl who wants to change the world. One night, Baby sneaks into a staff party and finds that the staff dances anything but the family fox trot. This where she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze.) When Johnny's ex-girlfriend Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant and wants an abortion (illegal in those days) Baby is asked to dance with Johnny at a contest. This is where the real chemistry begins. But when Baby's father Jake (Jerry Orbach) finds out about the abortion, he tells Baby not to hang around with Johnny. But Baby doesn't listen listen, and soon finds the love of her life. Throughout the movie Baby learns that you can't change the world alone, and she finds her true love, while Johnny finds out about the kind of person he wants to be.<br />Overall Grade: A (10++)
B00005BJPO|5.0|When my brother first told me about this movie back in late 1994, I was really skeptical about it.  However, once I saw it, then I realized that this was not your typical anime movie.  During that year, I purchased a laser disc player, and I went right away and bought Akira at a local laser disc store.  I have been one of the lucky ones who was able to watch it over and over again, without any worries about ruining the tape. Now, I will certainly add this title to my collection.  It is truly a story worth seeing and experiencing.  The imagery is intense, and the musical score riveting.  You will sit back and be memerized for over 124 minutes.  The Akira limited edition Dvd is the one to purchase, as it provides more in depth knowledge about the movie.  Do not wait to long or it will be gone before you know it.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat, this movie makes me crazy with both of actors! Al Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro.....Nothing to say any more to them. Just look at their faces, then I can't breath with their action and moving. Great.... I still think that they know how to act and say in the front of the camera. That must be gift and talent. As well,of course, passion,too.  They were,being and would be the best forever. Al &amp; Robert, you would be unforgettable actors in whole world. And my heart.

I loved being brought to every corner of Europe in this tape.  I will get this book in paperbook to re-read the humor and be brought back to Europe again.  I can only hope to meet Bryson's at the upcoming Maui Writer's Conference and have him laughing through the pages of my book.

I picked up &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and decided to buy it because the movie had just come out and I was interested in the story.  Well, I am glad I did buy it.  The book gives you an insight into the lives of a poverty striken family in Ireland and New York.  You get an idea of how hard life is for people living in deplorable conditions thanks to poverty and how they can pull through the tough times.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The musical is back, and it's driving force is Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge. A film set in turn of the century France put to the music of the 20th century, such songs as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; by Nirvana and Elton John's &quot;Your Song,&quot; takes the movie to new heights, adding more emotion to the allready heart felt story. The movie hits you with so much color and beauty you can't help but just being sucked into the world of the Moulin Rouge, as if you are experiencing this first hand.<br />With a outstanding cast, Moulin Rouge is truely a testimant to the ideals of love. With Ewan McGregor (Christian) and Nicole Kidman (Satine), giving performances so breathtaking and real, it makes you want to sing along. A great ensomble of co-stars, John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec) and Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidler), they make you just crave for more. <br />Christian (McGregor) is a pennyless poet who comes to the Moulin Rouge to join in the Bohemian revolution. In the persuit of Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all things, love. In a mix of comedy and tragedy the story of Christian and Satine (Kidman) is shown to you, and the ending...well...you'll have to see it for yourself.

B0000039PW|5.0|Hmm it's a good album...wait no a great album...forget that it's the BEST album.  When biggie dropped this album it hit like an atomic bomb, totally re-arranging the rap world and driving the fledging east-coast back to the top.  Normally I would tell you my favorite tracks but I'll just break it down with the whole damn CD is amazing.  From the intro to the ending &quot;Suicidal Thoughts&quot; The Notorious BIG put down everything thats essential for an instant classic, and believe it or not Puff Daddy...oh excuse me &quot;P. Diddy&quot; laced this whole album up with amazing beats.  If I could give this CD 10 stars I would, and like several reviewers on here mentioned, how could you give it anything less?  And finally this last part is for all angry Tupac Shakur fans coming down on this CD with 1 star reviews and cursing, Tupac and Biggie were equally great we all know it, but some of us would rather stay angry.  But isn't that anger the same kind that made us lose the two greatest MC's Tupac and Biggie?  Think about it, and grab this CD. Peace.
6305627401|5.0|I bought this DVD without ever seeing the film on video or at the movies, so I didn't know what to expect, other than a lot of crude humor that I was pretty sure would be funny.  To my surprise, South Park is much more than that.  Parker and Stone take aim at two targets in particular - the overinflated Hollywood/Broadway musical numbers (think Academy Awards production numbers) and the MPAA's hypocrisy in rating foul language more harmful to children than extreme violence.  The musical numbers are brilliant - highlights include the nonsensical &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do&quot; and the over the top &quot;Up There&quot; as sung by a lonely, homosexual Satan.  All of the old favorites make at least an appearance, and two new characters are especially funny - the effeminate &quot;braniac&quot; Gregory and the battle-scarred &quot;Mole&quot;.  Make no mistake, the language is foul, and the humor crude, but it took some genuinely talented people to put together a movie this funny on so many different levels.  Highly recommended, unless you're not in high school yet - in that case, wait a few years (you'll catch more of the jokes anyway).

6305718954|5.0|....how up front can it be?<br />A hairdresser is battered by stigmatic sufferings. In Aramaic, a language from the time of Jesus, she writes on the wall of her apartment that &quot;the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you.&quot; Heresy!!<br />The voice that announces her bleedings and butcherings and self-slashing agonies is always male. The traditionally masculine principle of arid spirituality can even elevate her off her bed, suspending her in mid-air.<br />It is women who suffer being pinned up, being hammered, being crowned with thorns, all the world over, but without getting any hearing on the agendas of the governments.<br />Let us be aware that the female victim in this film is taken over, not by just any old man, but by a religious idealist. Dying wasn't enough for him. This has a patriarchal angle; but it also reflects the fact that something worth hearing speaks forth from our wounds.
B000002LQR|5.0|okay, this cd has been out for a long time (10 years, this september), but it still kicks... and i still spin it with regularity. at 17 tracks it may seem unwieldy and excessive, but i think that's one of the secrets to this discs longevity. my favorite cuts change all the time and there's so much depth i'm always hearing new things. uplift mofo was a killer cd too and i love hillel, but john frusciante was born to play in this band. dave navarro has skills, but he isn't/wasn't a true chili pepper and the great cd californication was a return to true form showing how badly they needed john. his thin,reedy guitar parts are the perfect compliment to flea and chads extra thick rhythm (check john's weaving with flea on \\"mellowship\\" or \\"sir psycho\\", it's symbiotic) though he also takes charge too; powering through \\"greeting song\\" with some crisp riffing. these 4 guys are so talented and work so well together,it's astonishing and this cd has 17 examples of it. the band is as tight and immediate as a fist in the face.you need this cd. ---for an extra treat, pickup the \\"funky monks\\" vhs or dvd, which chronicles the making of BSSM..how many of you heard or knew of the toy piano in mellowship or how they got the sounds for the bridge in \\"breaking the girl\\"?..the documentary will give you a whole new view on this rekkid...ok,i'm done..sorry for the length (how many things did i review here?),

The number one hits are placed in chronological order so it gives a very nice review of the vast growth of their music over time, the digital remastering is also phenomenally well done.

0060207051|5.0|I can remember being read this book at bedtime by my mother and grandmother, in fact it is one of my earliest memories. This book has been part of bed time for millions of kids since it's inital print and will be for millions more to come. I'm now 23 and every now and then when I can't sleep I find that reading this book helps put my mind at ease and helps me drift off to sleep.
0425107469|5.0|I have been reading Koontz off and on for years, but I am largely disappointed, and I treat his books with a minimum of excitement.  I picked this one up hoping that a couple of chapters would put me to sleep...and they didn't!<br />This book was riveting!  The golden retreiver makes a wonderful hero, and a witty main character.  Koontz wisely limits himself to a handful of characters, but he paints them vividly and lovingly.  You find yourself overjoyed and dismayed with every flip of the page, and the story moves quickly and draws you in.<br />It has a couple really cheesy lines, such as &quot;he felt his warm seed fill her&quot; but all in all, the book is a FABULOUS read.  I read it in two nights because I was hooked.<br />You'll love Einstein the dog, and the sweet and unusual love story between Nora and Travis.  The story follows them from their exiting meeting through their romance, as they are hunted by a terrible beast and a psychopathic hit man, both driven by a vicious desire to rip Einstein away from the only family he's ever known.  The plot thickens as Koontz interjects many perspectives and arguments for and against radical genetic engineering.<br />I was sorry to read the last page, and you will be too!
B00004STPT|4.0|While very few pieces on this CD are great works, they do the job of evoking the emotions from the movie, if you have seen the movie then listening to this CD quickly brings exactly the point in the movie when the piece was played into your mind. I'm not usually a fan of Mr. Zimmer, but in this soundtrack he hits the nail square on the head.
0786915749|5.0|What can the Don say about this book that has not been said before. It's the beggining of an epic. The chance to see all of the future heroes and villans, and heroes who are at heart villans in thier younger days is a pleasure.

B00003CY3W|5.0|Just like the movies, comics are an art form. Just like movies, comics run the range from mass-market to high art. Nothing wrong with that; sometimes you're in the mood to see Bruce Willis battle Arnold Schwartzenegger on the screen, or read Batman slugging it out with the Joker. But just as you know there's much more to movies than action films, you should also be aware there's much more to comics than four-color superheroes. There's also a large amount of serious comic book literature out there that doesn't fit that superhero mold. And when the worlds of comics and movie collide, comic fanboys (yes, I'm one) often debate what is the best movie based on a comic book: &quot;Superman: The Movie?&quot; The first &quot;Batman?&quot; &quot;X-Men,&quot; or &quot;Blade?&quot; This discussion now must include a movie that features *no* overpumped steroid heroes in spandex. &quot;Ghost World,&quot; faithfully adapted from the comic by Daniel Clowes, is not merely one of the more faithful adaptations of a comic to a movie, but also is one of the most effective and affecting movies of 2001.<br />A funny, sarcastic, sharp slice-of-life, &quot;Ghost World&quot; follows Enid and Rebecca, two girls just graduated from high school. Not quite slackers, not quite ready for the &quot;real&quot; world, they wander through their summer, planning and putting off their future at the same time. Clowes and Zwigoff have a great ear for dialogue: Enid and Rebecca talk like real teenagers do: with sarcasm peppered with raw language mirroring their contempt *and* fascination with the people and places around them. As a fan of the graphic novel I can say it's a faithful adaptation, preserving events, dialogue, and even characters that look (often uncannily) like their graphic novel counterparts--but it doesn't treat its source material as precious and unchangeable; it expands and redirects the storyline of the comic, making it more linear, more unified and full in its examination of Enid's relationship with lonely, jazz-obsessed self-proclaimed dork Seymour. Seymour is quite possible Steve Buscemi's most effective role yet, in my opinion: weird, uncomfortable, but oddly sympathetic, fleshed out from a one-joke note in the graphic novel into a major character for the movie. It's a role worthy of an Oscar supporting actor nomination, and a clear sign to Hollywood that Buscemi *can* play more than just crazed crooks and hair-trigger criminals.<br />This weekend I also saw the first trailer (a year ahead of the movie) for &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; Aside from a clever teaser concept, this trailer shows off everything wrong with Hollywood's perception of making a movie from a comic book: overdone (and not that convincing) special effects, laughable spandex costumes, ear-splittingly loud soundtrack. After this, though, seeing &quot;Ghost World&quot; restored my faith in the possibility of well-done and touching movies based on a serious comic series.ationship with lonely, jazz-obsessed self-proclaimed dork Seymour.

B000000H5K|1.0|Sepultura was recommended to me by a friend and I was very disappointed.  The lead singer doesn't sing well at all, the music was chaotic and devoid of any hooks.  File this one under &quot;ugh.&quot;  If you want something loud that sounds good, go with Rammstein.
B00005B36H|5.0|Next to TOOL's Sober CD, this is one of the best. I've found that the group has really progressed as a whole and that their musical talent has greatly improved as well. TOOL have a huge following down here in NOLA (New Orleans, LA) and probably always will due to their musical style, lyrics and intellectual atmospheric mental images portrayed in their covers, as well as when they play live with their stage layouts. The new LATERLUS CD is definitely worth checking out. Enjoy!
6305313687|5.0|this movie is great. it really opens ones eys to the perils of racism, anti-semitism, and bigotry that goes on in this country. edward nortorn potrays his character phenomenally. it explains ones struggle with prejiduce and his escape from that world. i recomend this dvd to everyone.
B00000DG1R|5.0|First of all, I think that this collection is a really good one. Almost all the songs are really good. Its a really great album for starters. This is the first Duran Duran Cd I have bought. The reason I didn't rate greatest hits album 5 out of 5 is because they couldh have made the album a lot better. This album is just Duran Duran's Decade Album with a few extras. I agree with most people, They could have made it into a 2 cd album with a lot more hits including some arcadia stuff. Worst of all, They made some of the good songs shorter for enough room for having all the songs in. 80's music to me is a lot better then the music now. People nowadays listen to Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys etc.... When you ask them about old bands they always say they're a bunch of crap.  They have never realized how great these albums are. Bands like Duran Duran and Depeche Mode have made a strong influence on the bands of today. Even Though this album is mostly just decade its still the best duran duran cd.
B000002UDB|5.0|In a recent review of this CD, I trashed it and gave it a low rating. Well, I've finally come to my senses. This is a great album, not as solid as Revolver or Abbey Road, but it is very underrated. Some of the material is a bit below average (Flying, Your Mother Should Know), but the brilliant production generally makes up for the few weak spots. MMT contains some of Paul's best and catchiest pop tunes like Fool on the Hill and Penny Lane, John's brilliant psychadelic excursions (Strawberry Fields, I Am The Walrus), and the ever underappreciated George classic Blue Jay Way. If you don't own any Beatle albums, I suggest starting with Abbey Road or Revolver, but this is still an essential piece to any serious music fan's collection
B000002GYW|5.0|Thought it was not all that successful when it was released in 1973, the Eagles' DESPERADO remains the country-rock genre's greatest concept album.  Not surprisingly, it is built around the concept of Old West outlaws and rock and roll guitar slingers as being their 20th century equivalent.  But there's more to DESPERADO than just the concept.<br />The songwriting here is something a lot of today's singers (particularly in the country field) can only dream about.  The title track, written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey, has become a standard and has been covered by a lot of others (though a version by the Eagles' former benefactor Linda Ronstadt stands out the best).  &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; is also a memorable piece, with Bernie Leadon's countrified stringbender electric guitar licks and an almost Mexican acoustic guitar sound making it so.  Leadon also contributes his usual hard-driving bluegrass skills with &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.  The finale, a reprise of the title track and the album's opening track (&quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot;), is a grim epic, in which the outlaws' story seems to end in bullets and bloodshed a la Sam Peckinpah.<br />DESPERADO is an essential album for anyone interested in country-rock in general, and the Eagles in particular.
B00000IL1K|2.0|After much deliberation on my part I decided to Order a Brightman Cd and find out what all the fuss was about. I was unpleasently surprised. Sarah's voice, all though pleasent at first soon becomes annoying and titery. I would also say that although good, I am surpprised she got anywhere in life singing the way she does (a whole lot of air.)I'm sure fans will be pleased with this cd, but for anyone who likes the richness of opera music, don't bother.
0783225210|2.0|Every film maker, at some point, has a big flop in his time.  Some of them have more, many more.  Steven Spielberg is lucky to have had only two of them.<br />That said, however, &quot;1941&quot; is still not a very good film.  This is the only film of Spielberg's (aside from the equally bloated HOOK) that I could do without in my video collection.  It is loosely based on a wave of war hysteria that broke out in Los Angeles when a Japanese sub was spotted off the coast (an event that actually took place in February 1942; the story backdates it to a week after the Pearl Harbor attack).<br />Starting from a (presumably) hysterically funny screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (who would later do BACK TO THE FUTURE), with help from right-wing gung-ho schlockmeister John Milius, Spielberg assembled a huge cast of stars: Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, John Candy, Nancy Allen, Tim Matheson, Treat Williams, Robert Stack, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Lionel Stander, Dub Taylor, and many, many more.  He also got a first-rate technical crew with him, which resulted in &quot;1941&quot; picking up three Oscar nominations.  And there are certainly explosions, sight gags, jitterbug dances, facial mugging, and fight scenes by the score.<br />The problem, however, is that very little of it is actually FUNNY.  Isn't that what comedy is supposed to be?!  A lot of other reviewers here said that they laughed their heads off.  I won't dissuade them from feeling that way, but all I can say is that I didn't.  This wasn't an out-and-out laugh riot like AIRPLANE!; and if it was intended to be a political satire, it fell way short of the mark.  There are laughs in it, but it never manages to be consistently funny from start to finish.  <br />John Williams' unusually jaunty music score is the best thing about &quot;1941&quot;.  Other than that, however, this is a thirty million dollar clinker, one that thankfully Spielberg bounced back from.
B00004U2A1|5.0|This is a pretty short film (or at least it is compared to all the other films I own), so I'll keep the review short. Evil Dead II is typical Sam Raimi, there is an abundance of flair and wit, there is a lot of gore (of all colours(not colors, I'm English). The tone is set early on and it builds to an interesting conclusion , it leaves you wondering, it left me wanting more. The story is not really anything that breaks new ground, but this doesn't matter, the way the film is made and the way that it uses the elements of the story is fresh, or at least this is the case for me. The commentary is fun and interesting and the featurette, although a sign of the age in which it was made, is also good. Many people think that this film is overrated, that's down to them. Everyone is different, and in the end it's whether you like it or not that counts. Just to let you know, I like this.

6305014140|5.0|One of the best Anime works ever. Better than the sloth and senseless AKIRA. Better than the environmentally preachy and boring MONONOKE.<br />This is Anime AT IT'S BEST. Well written, honorable characters with depth and sensitivity, outnumbered, but not over-matched. The heroes fight outstanding battles against terrible villans with demon-like powers. Great character development, fantastic action and special effects, and a steamline story plot, not typical of the Anime genre.<br />This is Anime for everyone, except kids (Definitely R-rated). The story is simple enough, even for the most casual observer. Hardcore fans will enjoy the buckets of blood and graphic violence. Some of the scenes may be shocking, but they are not over-blown and add to the story. This is not merely a cartoon. Think of this movie in the same breath as Japanese classics like RAN and RASHOMON; only in Anime format. Watch this before you see anything else.
B00003CXA3|5.0|I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the DVD-release of this terrific film. Anyone who appreciates gritty, police dramas such as Hill Street Blues and NYPD can thank director William Friedkin, who set the standard with this movie. Two years later the same director made the stuffy Academy members start taking the Horror genre seriously with his release of The Exorcist. And Friedkin was way ahead of his time with the 1970 gay- themed The Boys in the Band. The man is quite a trendsetter, not to mention a damn fine director.<br />Gene Hackman, one of the finest, most versatile actors around, gives the performance of his career as the impulsive, almost maniacal, Popeye Doyle. Hackman's \\"balls-out\\" performance earned him the Academy Award for best actor. Incidentally, it is the  tenacity of his character which adds to the rush of the famous car/el-train chase. No one is going to take a pop at this guy and just slink away!<br />And what about the chase-scene? Some, including myself, feel that this is the best one ever on film. Others say it was done better in The Road Warrior; or Bullitt; or Raiders of the Lost Ark; or The Seven-Ups. ( Ronin is mentioned also, but I have never seen it.) These movies all had great chases, but they were shot either in the desert (Road Warrior and Raiders) or largely in the open road (Bullitt and Seven-Ups).  In The French Connection, however, the pursuit takes place in a crowded Brooklyn commuter hub. And appropriately so, as the film is all about the grit of the big city. Working within this challenging setting, editor Jerry Greenberg does a tremendous job of maintaining the continuity of a rather lengthy sequence of high-speed events.  <br />There is more that can be said about this great movie, but I'll leave it at this: Unlike a previous reviewer, I have no trouble discerning how this film earned its five Oscars.
B000002J1C|5.0|I really don't care if today's teenagers don't care about Yes.  Most popular music is more style than substance anyway.  Before Yes got wrapped up in their own self-importance with Close to The Edge and the self-indulging Tales of topgraphic etc., they created some very innovative and beautiful music.  What impresses me most is their use of dynamics in creating moods and atmosphere.  Outstanding vocal harmonies, and guitar work by Steve Howe.  Yours Is No Disgrace and I've Seen All Good People are worth the price of admission alone. The new remastered CD is clear and spacious. Let it take you away to a simpler time before cynicism crept into our mainstream.  A wonderful recording!
B00003CWTI|3.0|Magnolia has a lot to recommend it -- very talented cast, outstanding performances, interesting story lines and a great soundtrack. At one point, the skies even open up and it rains cats and frogs -- well, o.k., no cats.  The movie is so well done, that even the raining frogs seem to make sense. All the performances are terrific and interesting, from Tom Cruise as a malevolent motivational speaker to the bit-part Luis, a cantankerous but very funny game show contestant.  On the down side, this movie is really depressing. The plot follows about 5 main characters whose stories interlock. (I did feel after one viewing that there were a few scenes that did not make any sense.  Perhaps it takes a few viewings to fully get all the connections.)  While each of the stories is engrossing, the unifying theme seemed to be that we're each alone, locked into our own misery.  The only possible redemption, the movie seems to say, is forgiving ourselves and each other for the hurts that caused the misery in the first place.  But, as the lives of the characters show, forgiveness may elude us for a long time, even forever.  Sigh.  Definitely not happy thoughts.... I did appreciate the fine performances and music, but wished I'd picked a more uplifting film on which to spend those three hours. <br />The DVD has substantial interesting material about the making of the movie.
0345442989|5.0|Want to know why Volorum was mired in baseless accusations? Did you know Palpatine was considered Volorum's staunchest supporter although he had him ousted? Do you know how long Queen Amidala reigned for before the Battle of Naboo? Who was her predecessor? Who was Bail Antilles who was also up for the postition of Supreme Chancellor with Palpatine? What are some of the things Qui-Gon does to exasperate the Council? How do the Jedi really work? Do the Jedi really answer to the Senate? Why does a Trade Commission who are businessmen have an Army? Why did they blockade Naboo? All of these and more is answered in this book. You will love it. Good action, good Jedi-lore and probably the most well-thought out Star Wars book around. PREQUELS RULE! This is one of the best (although they are all good).
B000002J09|5.0|Chances of you reading this review are very slim so I won't get too eloquent. I watched the 100 Greatest Albums show on Vh1 and was very disappointed with 2 albums that I got because of it: Led Zeppelin I &amp; Led Zeppelin II. I have heard III is good, and Physical Graffiti is alright. But the 2 solid albums are Led Zeppelin IV &amp; Led Zeppelin V, probably Led Zeppelin IV being even more so. Led Zeppelin V (Houses of the Holy) is a very soothing album and was my favourite Led Zeppelin album until I heard IV. Now I just think both albums are great, in different ways, on different levels. <br />So you now you know...the full story
0453009115|5.0|If you haven't had the pleasure of listening to this absolutely classic novel, you are missing one of the great works of the mid twentieth century by rebel author Ayn Rand.  As you listen to this tape, you realize that you are drawn into the lives of the characters, their beliefs, political views and individual motives. You can't avoid understanding and analyzing their actions, as the author intended you to do.  This book is so well written, and did not come into it's own until well after the death of the author.  Compelling listening that would be a terrifc addition to your library of classics.

6305558167|2.0|I never saw &quot;Excalibur&quot; when it was released in theaters, but a friend of mine did, and he raved about it. When the DVD became available, I grabbed it, eager to see what my friend - and numerous professional critics - thought was an amazing film.<br />To put it mildly, &quot;Excalibur&quot; was disappointing. While I can see why my friend liked it back in 1981 - we were both 14 at the time - it holds little for me as an adult. The landscapes are suitably green and lush for Arthurian England, but the acting is amateurish, the special effects second rate (even for their time), and the story - while fairly faithful to the original - is told in less-than-gripping fashion. Alright, it's actually flat-out boring. (And I consider myself a patient viewer.)<br />The quality of the DVD transfer is quite good, and it's interesting to see Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne in early work, but viewing &quot;Excalibur&quot; is a chore. John Boorman has made MUCH better films (&quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot;), and for the life of me, I really cannot figure out why this movie is held in such high esteem. Maybe everyone who likes it first saw it as a 14 year old boy in the early eighties...

0767802659|4.0|As the reviewer below me says, some will like it for the wrong reasons. I wonder if by this he meant Casper Van Dien half naked and getting whipped??? Anyway to the more serious stuff, this film is not aimed at those seeking to spend a quiet evening in with an intellectual film. It does however offer 1 1/2 hours of non stop zip gun and fistfighting to sate the hunger of the biggest actionophile. The soldiers are battling bugs who have come from the next galaxy to destroy humankind. These bugs are huge and powerful, and the soldiers are inept and bungling! This leads to many laughs, some of them sick as people die in stupid ways. The violence is comic book, never is it taken seriously. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants an accompanyment to his/her beer and pizza.

B00004Z459|4.0|I wouldn't say that this CD is the greatest ever made, but it's not a waste of money either.  I buy so many CD's, and believe me, I've had a few that were a total waste of money.<br />My favorite songs are:  Papercut, One Step Closer, Points of Authority, In The End, and A Place For My Head.<br />One Step Closer is probably the ultimate song on this CD.  It has great bass, beat, and meaningful words.  This song is so much fun to play really really loud while cruising in your car.<br />Points of Authority is the second most ultimate song.  I love the music, and the words are once again great.  This is also a great song to play on high volume.   The songs By Myself and Pushing Me Away I usually skip over.  For some reason I just can't stand those.  Forgotten should almost be \\"forgotten\\".  I hate the beginning of this song, as well as the other heavy parts where they sing about, \\"From the top to the bottom...\\", and some other stuff, but the calmer parts of the song I really like.<br />Cure For The Itch is an interesting song.  It's more like a bunch of songs and sounds being mixed together rather than a song, but it's still worth listening to.<br />The one great thing about this CD is the fact that there isn't a Parental Advisory on it.  It doesn't need one.  I'm not one that says objectionable language on CD's should be banned all together because I've bought quite a few with warnings, but it was nice to find a hard, angry CD that didn't have a bad word every 3 seconds.
B000002TYX|4.0|High expectations have always followed any Beatle-related project, and disappointment always seem to follow high expectations.  I think people expected the anthology series to somehow be more than what it was, and maybe that particularly applies to Anthology 1.  There is a lot of speaking voices on disc 1, and the early recorded music history of the group was not the best in terms of audio fidelity.  For this reason, Anthology 1 came under a lot of criticism.  <br />But it is what it is - an early history of the group in sound.  I wish there would have been better quality performances of their early years available, but that simply is not the case.  It's fortunate that we have what we have - their first ever recording, the Cavern rehearsal tape, the Star Club tape, etc.  Yes, the sound is crude, but offers a glimpse of the Beatles' formative years.  We can't ask for anything more, because this is all that exists.<br />The Beatles made many appearances, on stage and on TV (and radio) during early Bealtemania.  Again, some of this is somewhat crude sounding, but fascinating all the same.  Their performance for Swedish radio in '63 is, I think, some of the most ferocious live playing I've ever heard, and gives us a taste of what it might have been like to catch them live in a club on a good night.<br />Finally, the studio outtakes from this early period are probably the least interesting outtakes of the groups career, but it is still fascinating to see how some of the songs evolved and changed.  And I Love Her, for instance, quickly evolved from a beat ballad to the sublime and beatiful arrangement we hear on A Hard Day's Night.  Not all outtakes are that revelatory, but are still a good listen.<br />Nope, this certainly isn't the polished product that we expected from the Beatles during their heyday.  And it is true that George Martin and the group had the instinct to always select the right song and the right take.  But, this release is a piece of history, an important piece of history.  Considered in that context, it was, is and will remain an important and valid piece of the Beatles' cannon.
0441008356|5.0|Alastair Reynolds has produced an amazing masterpiece (an incredible debut!) blending the extrapolations of hard science with unforgettable characters set in a possible and disturbing future five centuries from now.  This is a thinking person's novel, not light reading to be finished overnight.  The conceptions from nanotechnology, astrophysics, genetic engineering, and computer science will stimulate you and keep you thinking long after finishing the book.  It is so well written, that despite its length I was left wishing it would continue for a few hundred pages more.  The vast panorama of intergalactic history and conflict, spanning billions of years, and the original ideas the author presents establish him as one of the most powerful voices of modern science fiction, in the tradition of Arthur Clarke, A.E. van Vogt, Jack Williamson, and a few others.  Although the power of this novel emerges primarily from the dizzying vistas of the future and the alien artifacts and civilizations it paints in cataclysmic brush strokes, it also features outstanding characters not easily forgotten:  Khouri, the soldier assassin, and Ilia Volyova, the dynamic Triumvir on the starship Infinity, are easily two of the strongest female characters in sf literature, and the pathos of Dan Sylveste will long linger in memory as well.  This novel is a first rate masterpiece of the calibre of  Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END, Williamson &amp; Gunn's STAR BRIDGE, and A.E. van Vogt's VOYAGE OF THE SPACE BEAGLE.  Highly recommended!
014100018X|3.0|I at first loved this book.  The characterizations were wonderful, the descriptions rich and vivid, and the writing clear and entertaining.  But I found that there was so much alluded to that was not explored in enough detail, and things happened for which there was not enough explanation.  When the book ended, I found it to be a big letdown.<br />It has a lot of merit because of the strength of the writing and the story line, but it could have used a few extra chapters to fully flesh out some of the items that were alluded to.
0345350499|4.0|There is very little more that can be added to the already numerous insights into this book.  This was the second book I have read about the Arthurian legend, the first being White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, and Bradley's I found to be better by far.  Bradley was able to weave the old tale, much of which has been a jumbled of different versions of the myth, and tell it for a different point of view.  Bradley has for the most part used females as her protagonist in her other works and continues the trend by telling the legend from the woman's point of view.  Bradley mainly focuses on Morgaine and her story, but also tells us of Igraine, mother of Arthur; Viviane, Lady of the Lake before Morgaine and mother of Lancelot; Morgause, aunt to Arthur, mother of a number of his Companions, and all-around power hungry woman; and Gwynhefar, the only character other then Morgaine to provoke such strong emotions that you will either love her or hate her.  The only deterrent to the book is that due to the chronological length of the story the book is very long and at some points, especially when the theological debate is voiced (though this is even done so smoothly that one can hardly notice it), very slow.  However, these spots are few and do not detract from the overall story.  The one character that I wish Bradley went more in-depth on was Raven, though it would have been difficult to write on a character that says nothing unless prompted by a prophetic vision.  Like the majority of fans I would suggest this book to everyone, and encourage the skeptics to read it, arguing that it is worth their time.
0792838084|5.0|I've always loved David Lynch (ever since i first laid eyes on Twin Peaks). Kyle Maclachlan is a great on screen presence,and every character(in true Lynchian style) is superb. If you are one for strange and ground breaking, you will instanly fall into this with wide eyes and wide mouth.

B000002WYT|5.0|&quot;Crash&quot; is and will always be my all-time favorite chill album.  I always sit and put this one on when its time to study for an exam or even read.  Just listen to the segue from &quot;#41&quot; to &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; that is one of the most beautiful moments in music.  And the jam in the middle of &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot; is terrific.  Then there is the song that will always be mentioned in the same breath as Dave Matthews Band, &quot;Crash into Me&quot; one of the best songs in the last decade of music.  For fans looking to get into the Dave Matthews Band I would recommend this as the first album you purchase regarding Dave Matthews Band, then probably Under the Table and Dreaming, either way you can't go wrong.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Loved the album, 1 of my faves.  if u like this then u should order Audio Stepchild, Land of the Snake Charmer, rumor has it that this is also Eminem...Track2 is called Bizzare same as D12 member, sounds like Em and has great lyrics, this is as good as this album, also has track with Prince, and Tupac produce My Kill, Michael Calderon, says it is pre-order, but I got mine right away.
B000002U82|4.0|The music on this album is so great that I wish Pink Floyd would have played more of it. To me, the sound effects serve little purpose, and I much prefer an album with little to no studio enhancement. The two or three minute slots of jamming or whatever it is, that lead into a lot of the songs, I find to be a waste. I'm sure there's more to it than I'm saying, I haven't listened  much. But for me, it wasn't that enjoyable a listen. I'm still giving to four stars, because the actual music is very good.
B000002LRX|5.0|when you put 5 guys in a band that dont have a thing in common you might get faih no more ,but i really think so.any ways this is the one of the best albums of the ninetys .when it came out it did get mixed reviews.but my opion was one and still is one of the top 3 best albums only after seeing these guys a couple  of years before i knew these guys were on to some thing a little more original then most stuff out there at the time !a mixture of metal punk insanity keyboards rap dynamic  groove stomping cheerleading  whatever.isnt this kind of the formula of all those new bands.well see my point .just buy the originall and you just may graduate from kindagarden........
B000003N7G|5.0|There are not enough stars in the sky, and no words I can say here that will do it justice.
B00000IAU3|4.0|This is a really good album. When I first bought it I was really unsure of it, and it took a few listens until I really got hooked. Dido has an awesome voice, and it is also very unique.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Live at Leeds was the 2nd Who CD I ever bought (Who's Next was the 1st), and it's possibly the best introduction to this great rock and roll band. This is constantly acclaimed as one of the best live albums ever made, and deservedly so. It's difficult to imagine a band more on top of their game, than The Who are here on Live At Leeds (although admittedly, this and live material from Monterey Pop and Woodstock are the only live Who I've heard so far). Live at Leeds is great in every possible way. This is truly rock and roll at its finest. Every member of The Who shines on this disc. Townshend's guitar playing is positively furious, very loud and very hard rocking. John Entwhistle's bass is nearly as prominent as Pete's guitar, and the same for Keith's drumming. Roger's vocals are also in tip-top shape. <br />Live at Leeds has to be the best Who CD that you can buy. No themes, no concepts, no operas (except for A Quick One), just pure rock and roll. If you're looking to get into The Who, you should start here.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is, in a word, amazing.  This is my favorite movie EVER, which says a whole lot considering the following two facts:  (1) I don't like foreign films, and (2) nor do I like period pieces.  That this happens to be BOTH and, somehow, inexplicably, still manages to be my favorite movie of all time says amazing things about it.  The acting is splendid, as I can't imagine anyone else playing any of these characters, from Jennifer Ehle's perfect rendition of Elizabeth Bennet to Julia Sawalha's equally perfect interpretation of annoying Lydia Bennet.  Yep.  Perfect.  At over five hours in length, the movie manages to capture the essence of the book, without ever seeming slow or tedious.  I'm sure other reviews will give you a more precise summary of the plot, so I'll refrain.  <br />What I do want to mention is that the dvd version that is being reviewed is a re-release (not an original release) and, as such, it is NOT YET AVAILABLE.  It is my understanding is that this new version will my MUCH BETTER than the previously available version in America.  The previous version (the one I own and, I believe, the one others are basing their reviews on) has no DVD extras, the episodes are not seemless (credits run at the end of each episode) and the picture quality is poor at best (it's nothing better than a vhs to dvd transfer--not truly the digitial quality you've come to expect from dvds).  This original release is now out-of-print.  The new upcoming version, which I am eagerly anticipating, WILL have new dvd features, and I believe will be similar to the version already available in Europe.  Accordingly, I think the criticisms aimed at the DVD features are unfair because THAT'S NOT THE VERSION WE'RE REVIEWING.  To get a better sense of how this new version's features stand up to expectations, please look at the amazon u.k. site for reviews of the european version.  It seems A&amp;E/BBC are fixing the complaints of the original dvd, so this re-release promises to be much better!
B000002LND|5.0|This is Madonna's best album.  All the songs are hits.  The only song I don't like is &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.<br />My favoritesongs are the classic Madonna tunes &quot;Crazy For You&quot;, &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, and &quot;Cherish&quot;.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fun [stuff] about a man whose job is so immoral, he goes insane. Overlong, it lurches unevenly from Tex Avery slapstick to glib superficiality to the inspired, often in one scene. At it's best it resonates the observational rapping of best stand up comedy and it's brilliant sense of humour makes one forgive it's missed opportunities. Anyone recalling the abandoned six army of Germany at Stalingrad will find the absurdity, cruelty and farce of Fascism portrayed here as on the money. However, far from being a contemporary tract, it cheekily re-packages punk for those who missed it the first time while making oldsters nostalgic for their pogo-ing past. The central conceit of the film slyly changing the jobless 'no future' ethos of 77 to the 'no future' because we've got a job whingeing of 99. There's chutzpah for you, but it's still the same old, same old. The dyed spiked hair and anarchist posturings of Tyler Durden recalling you-know-who of the Sex Pistols. Also, the pantheist vision of a weed infested superhighway with people growing vegetables coupled with a socialist manifesto of returning to economic parity recalls the accusation of the time that punks were in fact the new hippies. It's questionable whether any victim of recent downsizing in the go-slow-bust technologies industries will relate to the protaganist's security of tenure and perks anyway, it's something of a chimera on Palahniuk's part. He has gone on to write further preposterous novels to mixed reviews and some disillusionment over his one trick pony-ism. That's probably why Fight Club, although superlative and engaging because it is hard to catogorise, doesn't stand up to too many repeat viewings. It suffers the same affliction as punk, that is, beyond the initial expression of frustration and anger there isn't a lot to say. Americans can only sing the one song, but they'll play it in hell, and seldom with the panache here.

0767830520|5.0|Robert De Niro stars in the classic 1973 Martin Scorsese film Taxi Driver. Travis Bickle, the ex-marine loner has come to New York City in search of work.  Taking a job as a taxi driver, Travis slowly begins to realize the futility of his life, and the lonelyness that begins to plague him.  His days are filled with regularity, and he begins to inspire a hate towards the city, which he regards to be filled with disgusting garbage (He's right for the most part)that needs to be washed away.  Every day he becomes more enraged at his surroundings until he eventually becomes a self-appointed vigilante.  Attempting to rescue a teenage prostitute (Young star Jodie Foster) from the ghettos of the city, it becomes his mission.  A great film, one of Scorsese's best.
B00000DFRS|4.0|1. It's Not Right But It's Okay - This song is great, I know a lot of people like the Thunderpuss remix more, but the album version IMO is wonderful.<br />2. Heartbreak Hotel - This song was a huge hit for Whitney, and it was great to have Kelly Price and Faith Evan on the track all those girls can SANG!<br />3. My Love Is Your Love - The title track and my favorite song on the album.<br />  4. When You Believe - I hate this song.  It's just such a bad song.  You would thinkg whoever came up with the idea of a Whitney/Mariah duet would at least give them good material.<br />5. If I Told You That - I love this song and really think it should have been released as a single.<br />6. In My Business - A great track with Whitney and Missy. :) <br />7. I Learned from the Best - Classic Whitney!<br />8. Oh Yes - Great slow Jam!<br />9. Get It Back - Another good track by Rodney Jerkins...I think this could have been a single too.<br />10. Until You Come Back - I don't like this song, it's a really bland ballad.<br />11. I Bow Out - One of the best songs that Whitney has ever done!<br />12. You'll Never Stand Alone - This is another classic Whitney ballad.  This song is just beautiful.<br />13. I Was Made to Love Him - This song is just awful, why is it even on the album, just a waste of space.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Some bands grow as they make albums. But, it's kind of the opposite with the Offspring. This album is more humorous and sarcastic then the previous Offspring records. 'Americana,' is not what you'd call light-hearted, but it is much different than the last few albums the Offspring has made. This album has it's share of dark moments, but when it hits the funny bone, it hits hard. The lead-off single, the hilarious, &quot;Pretty Fly (For A White Guy),&quot; takes the bigger piece of the pie for the funniest song of the album. The Beatles' &quot;Ob La Di, Ob La Da,&quot; is taken aback in an obvious spoof here, on &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job.&quot; It's a song where it's still Offspring, but with more reggae to separate it from the Beatles' song. After fast-forwarding through 4 minutes 50 seconds of strange psychedelic rock, &quot;Pay The Man,&quot; becomes a glorious punk song with superb attitude. Almost an American anthem. The title track is a pounding, thunderous song. The best song on the album, the blaring, fast-paced, &quot;Staring At The Sun,&quot; can pretty much sum the entire album up in 3 minutes. It's kind of funny, kind of dark, it's the album's concept. With the humorous crime-caper song, &quot;Walla Walla,&quot; the love and death ballad, &quot;End Of The Line,&quot; and the heavy-metal punk ode to the youngins in the ghetto, &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright,&quot; 'Americana,' is another step into greatness by the Offspring. Touching, funny, angry and energized, this one is definetly worthy of purchase. What other album can you find a cover of &quot;Feelngs,&quot; but punkier? What other album has a girl who yells out 'daddy,' during sex (&quot;She's Got Issues&quot;)? Does any album have Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman commenting on the tracks after they're over? No, and that's why 'Americana,' is such a treat. There are plenty of words to describe it, but it would just be repitition, because it's pretty much the same as any other Offspring album. The Offspring have a knack for writing albums that stand out, even when they sound the same as before. Most bands try experimenting, but when the Offspring do it, it doesn't sound different. And it might sound bad, saying that, but it isn't. the offspring still sound fresh, even after all these years. This is 'Americana,' land of the free.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|This album is okay except ther are way to many ballads for jennifer's weak voice.  But up-tempo tracks are good.<br />1. If You Had My Love - Jennifer big hit, this song is really catchy and good.<br />2. Should've Never - This is an anverage song, it's a slow song but Jennifer isn't really singing that much, but talking her way through it...it goes a little long.<br />3. Too Late - Best track on the album... it's a mid tempo R&amp;B number and it's a great song.<br />4. Feelin' So Good - Another good up-tempo I think Fat Joe &amp; BIG Pun are great on this track too.<br />5. Let's Get Loud - Good up-tempo latin style song.<br />6. Could This Be Love - This is just..yuck..Jennifer needs to stay away from these types of ballads.<br />7. No Me Ames [Tropical Remix] - I love this duet!<br />  8. Waiting for Tonight -  This was my favorite song when I first got the CD.<br />9. Open of My Love - A nice mid-tempo song.<br />10. Promise Me You'll Try - A ballad that Jennifer needs to stay away from, she does not have the voice to be singign these types of songs.  They just stop the whole CD dead.<br />11. It's Not That Serious - This song just isn't good...I just don't like it.<br />12. Talk About Us - Another ballad...that isn't good.<br />13. No Me Ames - Ballad version, it's good..not as good as the remix that is on the album earlier.<br />14. Una Noche Mas - Spanish version of &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot;...it's just as good as the other version.
B00000IPAX|4.0|In a world where pop music isn't accepted nearly as much as it used to be, because of boy band acts like *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees, this album has a love-hate relationship with the punk-rock genre. Fans of Blink's first three albums were highly disappointed. But, Blink soon earned a large number of TRL-viewing teeny boppers as their new loyal fan base. It began a long, hard uphill battle to win fans back. But, maybe, just maybe, when the album first came out, the original Blink fans thought it was spectacular. Another worthy effort from the most immature boys around. But, when all of a sudden, the irony-laden video for &quot;All The Small Things,&quot; was on TRL non-stop, people began to regard Blink 182 as sell-outs, another boy band, and just plain crap. Amazing, isn't it, how we all just seem to hate pop because a group of five young boys ruined it all? Well, the truth is that 'Enema Of The State,' is a pretty good record. Not quite as lively and downright hilarious as their previous CD, 'Dude Ranch,' but close. 'Enema,' does have funny lyrics, more heavy guitars and pounding drum beats, but it's a tad more mature. Perhaps our boys are growing up, hmmm? Whatever the case, the CD still has a good quality to it. With it's first single, &quot;What's My Age Again,&quot; the anthem for the teenage boys of America, it proves Blink may have a softer side, but still have the immaturity level we love. Mainly, the songs deal with the usual, Blink 182 topics: bad girlfriends (&quot;Dumpweed&quot;), impossible girls (&quot;Wendy Clear&quot;), parents (&quot;Anthem&quot;), and possible love (&quot;Going Away To College&quot;). Even some new topics pop up. Extra-teresstrials (&quot;Aliens Exist&quot;), pedophiles (&quot;Dynestary Gary&quot;), and suicide (&quot;Adam's Song,&quot; a lovely song for Blink 182). It may be a different, growing Blink 182, but yknow, maybe they'll soon realize how much a success, and how much of a failure it really was. Because, we all know we'll hate the day when they have to change their group name to Blink TRL.
B000056VIY|4.0|1. Love Don't Cost A Thing - Y know this one.<br />2. I'm Real - My favorite track before I got the CD, I had the mp3.  it's still my favorite song on the album.<br />3. Play - I'm not really into this song.  it's just boring.<br />4. Walking On Sunshine - Love this track!  It's a great dancy song.<br />5. Ain't It Funny - Nice mid-tempo ballad...should be released as a single.<br />6. Carino - This is the &quot;let's Get Loud&quot; of this album...only better.<br />7. Come Over - This song is horrible.<br />8. We Gotta Talk - This is an okay so song but I really just skip over it.<br /> 9. That's Not Me - I'm not felling this song it's just BLAH!<br />10. Dance With Me - Same as above<br />11. Secretly - This is a great song...one of the best Jennifer's ever done.<br />12. I'm Gonna Be Alright - This is a good song, it sample &quot;6th Wonder&quot; by The Sugar Hill Gang<br />13. That's The Way - Love This Rodney Jerkins track.  I think this should be a single too.<br />14. Dame (Touch Me)- Great song!<br />15. Si Ya Se Acabo - I don't like this one to much.
0425173895|4.0|I have never read an Agatha Christie novel before this, and I must say that she does live up to all the hype and talk I have heard. The book was absolutely fabulous -- with an intriguing and engaging plot, surprising moments, and good insight into the characters and motives. I found myself continually replaying the events of the novel in my head after reading the novel in wonder and awe of how such a murder could take place. I also fell in love with the cute Belgian invesigator, Hercule Poirot -- who in some ways seems to possess a certain instinct and subtlety in his manners which many other detectives seem to lack. The books is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to expose himself to one of the foundations of the mystery genre.
B000002AVF|5.0|Along with &quot;Butterfly&quot; this is one of Mariah's best CD's..It has everything from pop, R&amp;B, and A/C Ballads.  The best songs are &quot;Melt Away&quot;, &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot;, and of course the classic pop tune &quot;Fantasy&quot;.
B000002UB3|5.0|Yes, I *do* own all of the Beatles' albums (British releases on CD, most American releases on vinyl).  That's the best warning I can give you.<br />&quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the last album recorded by the Beatles, even though it was released prior to &quot;Let It Be.&quot;  Some of the interpersonal tensions among the bandmembers come through a bit in the production values.  For example, you can tell that John and Paul rarely appear on one another's compositions despite the dual composer credit listed.<br />Top picks on this album include &quot;Come Together,&quot; a Lennon cut, and &quot;Oh, Darling,&quot; a McCartney barrelhouse piano number.<br />Side two of the album (actually listed this way on the CD cover, by the way) works as a rock opera ... the pieces segue well into one another, building up to &quot;The End,&quot; which is a fairly simple piece with a profound message.<br />If you don't have this album in your collection, hurry up and get it!
B000002J1S|5.0|The is one of the best, least-known albums in the history of rock.  Largely the brain-child of Peter Gabriel, it is a contata that tells the story of Rael, The Imperial Aerosol Kid, and his journies through a surreal New York City.  Almost every song is great, however it is a must to read the poem in the liner notes to try to understand what the hell is going on.  Remember, it was the '70's!
B00001OH7U|5.0|&quot;Station to Station&quot; is one of my all-time favorite David Bowie albums.  From the title track, with its locomotive-like introduction, to &quot;Wild Is The Wind,&quot; to the disco-paced &quot;Golden Years,&quot; there is not a weak cut to be found on this album.  This particular outing shows some of Bowie's more unusual influences, such as Kraftwerk's Dorian Schneider (&quot;TVC-15&quot;).  This is an absolute &quot;must&quot; in any collection, from the serious Bowie-phile to the most eclectic.
B000001ELL|5.0|I Started Listing To The Music Of The Kiss dynasty Album Back In<br />1984 When I Was In My Teen's Now That Im In My Early To Mid <br />Thritys I Can Enjoy It Even More.
B00001OH7O|4.0|If you're not familiar with David Bowie's ever-changing styles, his career can look like a real mish-mash.  He goes through some definite phases.  &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; is still much more folky than some of Bowie's later work.  The big hit from this album is &quot;Changes,&quot; memorable for its stuttering hook.  However, two cuts of which I'm inordinately fond are &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; (to which one of my birds loved to sing ... it really wound him up, and I'm not sure why) and &quot;Song for Bob Dylan.&quot;  The latter shows Bowie's vocal versatility in an interesting way ... his ability to sound strangely like Dylan himself.  This is an important album in terms of Bowie's career history ... just not one of my absolute favorites.  It's vital, though, that true Bowie-philes own a copy.
B00004X01U|1.0|Madonna had done her best before, and this CD proves that I am right. There R nothing but silly drum-machines and crazy synthetizers going on here, this album has no hits, those radio edits show us the album itself. Every song is like the other, it is 4 real hardcore Madonna fans. May be I am not that hardcore fan, but this CD is dull 4 an average pop-music listener 2. If U want 2 hear great Madonna buy her first few albums, Like a Prayer or just simply her Immaculate Collection, that nobody can go wrong with.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's hard to figure out what *hasn't* been said about this album.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was a real departure for the Beatles, branching out into such highly experimental production techniques as back-masking (cutting up tape and intersplicing it upside-down and backwards to obtain completely different sounds).  There are no particularly weak cuts on this album, but some rank higher in my &quot;list of favorites&quot; than others.  My absolute favorite track is &quot;Lovely Rita Metermaid,&quot; for its interesting counterpoint and harmonic structure.  As with most folks, I love the opening cuts, &quot;Sgt. Pepper/With a Little Help from My Friends,&quot; but am especially fond of the more raucous &quot;Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)&quot; that comes later in the album.  If I were to create one of those &quot;desert island disc&quot; lists that you see periodically, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; would absolutely be included.  This is a &quot;must&quot; for any album collection.
0679735259|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've read in a while.  Reading it was an experience.  I read it in one night because the refreshing vignettes always kept my attention.  The book is filled with military jargon, so it might help to read a history of the Vietnam War beforehand.
B000000W9Z|2.0|There was a time when I would purchase any new David Bowie album without hearing a single track from it beforehand.  This is the album that broke me of that habit.  :-(  Having been a fan (at this particular point in time) for 25 years, that's rather sad.  &quot;Outside&quot; was one of the most disappointing albums I've ever heard.  Bowie's venture into industrial metal should never have taken place.  Despite the fact that 9-Inch Nails would have no career without the influence of David Bowie, the reciprocal situation does not work so well.  I really only liked one track, a revamped &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (originally recorded for &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; soundtrack).  Even the most die-hard of Bowie fans (such as myself) might find this album not up to David's usual par.
6305657939|4.0|This movie creates its own little world, and successfully never leaves it.  We get a window into the very posh world of the upper crust, without ever being belabored with the arctic brutality that is sometimes exhibited by that class (a term which sometimes seems ironic).  But this movie isn't really about that ... that is merely the story's terrain.<br />The movie is full of things to like.  Brosnan's Thomas Crown very successfully lives up to being compared at the beginning to Odysseus (a character Homer described as a man who was &quot;never at a loss&quot;).  He is elegant and poised, regardless of the circumstances. His ability to always be in control and remain unruffled seems the source of his ennui, which pushes him into seeking danger just for the thrill.<br />Russo is very formidable, which is in of itself refreshing for a Hollywood film.  She also proves right down to the skin that a woman does not have to be 21 to be beautiful.<br />The photography and use of color assist in luring you into the movie's comfortable little world:  you simply cannot take your eyes off the color of the muted lighting in the restaurant, the details in a person's skin, or the sharp clarity of the fabric of a shirt-cuff.  The photography makes you *feel* what Crown's world feels like.<br />And, typical of McTiernan films, there is no such thing as an &quot;extra.&quot;  Everyone we bump into is a very real, flesh and blood person who just doesn't happen to be the subject of the plot.<br />But best of all is Crown's incredible skill at the art of deception.  Through forethought, methodical planning, and with a knowledge of misdirection, he's always tantalizingly just out of reach.<br />In using these skills to relieve boredom, he meets someone he considers more valuable than his little kingdom.  Smartly, the film shows that Crown has to use his skills, and risk imprisonment, to get himself out of the trouble he created and ultimately to acquire what he really wants.<br />This can really be seen as a morality play about people who love wealth and games, and then discover that those things don't fill the void inside - then, each must risk something to acquire something more important:  love.<br />Russo's character proposes the question, &quot;Do you think there's happily-ever-after for people like us?&quot;  The film seems to answer &quot;yes&quot; - but it also suggests, like another film about a thief (Douglas Fairbanks' &quot;Thief of Bagdad&quot;), that happiness must be earned, not stolen.
B00001OH7M|4.0|I see this particular album as a transitional one for David Bowie. Witness that it has several different versions of cover art and you'll see what I mean.  &quot;Space Oddity&quot; sees Bowie moving from a coffeehouse Folkie type into the first steps toward his Ziggy Stardust persona.  My two favorite cuts, aside from the title track, are &quot;Jeannine&quot; and &quot;Letter to Hermione.&quot;  The latter is a lovely ballad concerning Bowie's breakup with dancer girlfriend Hermione Farthingale; the former is a pop paeon to an obviously untouchable girl &quot;on the scene.&quot;  This is a good album in many ways, but the varying styles (thus my feeling that it's transitional) can be a trifle disconcerting at times.
B00003CY3W|2.0|There was no movie scheduled to come out this year I was more looking forward to than \\"Ghost World\\". Zwigoff (whose \\"Crumb\\" is one of the great films of the nineties), the source material, the stunning reviews -- I was prepared for something masterful. What I saw instead was a movie full of compromise and tonal confusion. <br />The world of post-adolescent alienation which is so well depicted in Clowes's books is here reduced to cheap shots at tacky cultural cliches (the video-store clerk who's never heard of \\"8 1/2\\", the high school art teacher who overlooks true expression in favor of political statement). The \\"journey\\" of the lead character Enid (Thora Birch) is narratively awkward and, in fact, fundementally conventional (\\"maybe it's better to get to know people instead of just making fun of them\\"). And the story is littered with stale narrative twists (the best friend who's not such a good friend after all, the tortured lover who acts on misinformation). I imagine the problem really lies with the fact that Zwigoff was far more closely identified with the Seymour character than with the Enid character. Seymour is really the one most alienated from society in this movie. His scenes with women feel extremely authentic but horribly uncomfortable. Seymour goes out with an attractive blonde real-estate agent for awhile, but the fact that she doesn't like Laurel and Hardy will always make them a irreconciliable couple. In \\"Crumb\\" Zwigoff was able to look at this social misfit character in a way that was at once ironic, indicting and sympathetic. With Seymour, he tries only for sympathy and ends up making everyone involved seem pathetic. <br />I don't understand why the critics, some of our best critics, are jumping all over this film. It may be the best reviewed film of the year so far. Is it possible that they too identify with Seymour, so much so that they are willing to overlook the dramatic void this movie is? And where is the perfectly executed, Clowes-inspired world the critics have hailed? It feels and looks more like a \\"after-School special\\" directed by Seymour himself.
B000002UAX|4.0|As previously mentioned in another review, I own all of the Beatles' albums.  &quot;The Beatles,&quot; colloquially referred to as &quot;The White Album,&quot; is not a huge favorite of mine.  All the same, there are a number of quite worthwhile cuts to be found.  I am particularly fond of &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; and &quot;Why Don't We Do It In The Road,&quot; the former for its novelty value and the latter for reasons I can't quite define. :-)  &quot;Martha My Dear,&quot; Paul McCartney's paeon to his sheepdog, is also quite charming with its Joplinesque piano.  This album is essential in terms of fleshing out one's collection.  However, I really think that one disc of really great music could have been made rather than two discs with so much &quot;filler.&quot;
B00004XOWN|4.0|This album certanly rocks, but there is WAY TO MUCH CUSSING! You start out with the intro, but then you hit Hot Dog which says the f word 48 times. I literally lost count. Then My Generation, which cusses 20 times or so. Full Nelson basically says in vulgur terms that if you tease or spread rumors about people, than you will get beat up. My Way and Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle) are easily my favorites. Even my mom likes My Way. Rollin is purely energy. Livin it up is about livin life without caring less about anything, but also talks about drugs, but they edit that out. The One is kinda like My Way. Getcha Groove On cusses like 25 times. Its really annoying. Take A Look Around is the Mission Impossible theme song, so most people probably know it. It'll Be OK is kinda like Trains \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" in terms with the message. Boiler and Hold On are also like My Way. Rollin (UAV) starts off like this \\" Play that f--king track!\\" It is defently all energy. Outro is annoying. Its 9:49 long!! All and all, if you get past the cussing, you have a great album.
014028009X|5.0|I've read this book after seeing the movie that was great. The book is different from the movie because you can't put all that was written in the book in 2 hours of a movie. This book is hillrious. Bridget is a 32 years old woman who made resoulations for the new year 1.Loose weight 2.Drink less 3.Smoke less 4.To find the right man. This movie tells about what she goes through the whole year and finally she meets with Mark Darcy (Like Mr.Darcy in pride&amp;prejudice)Read this book It's Great book.

B00005B7CK|5.0|I haven't seen a Coen Brothers movie that I didn't like. This movie is no exception. &quot;O Brother&quot; has everything: Comedy, Action, and great music. It's based loosely on Homer's Odyssey, taking some of the character traits and situations from that and putting them into a more modern scenario. For example, turning Tiresias the prophet into an old blind African American Railroad worker, or Polyphemus the Cyclops into a con man/Bible salesman with an eye-patch. The movie is full of humor that anyone would love. I'm fourteen and I loved it, my sister, an eighteen year old, loved it, and both of my parents loved it. If you liked this movie, I also recommend &quot;Raising Arizona,&quot; &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy,&quot; and almost any other Coen Brothers movie. Some of their movies like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; have a different kind of humor, but they are still funny. If you haven't seen this movie, it's well worth buying. You'll want to watch it over and over again.
B00000BKDY|5.0|If you've seen my Wish List, you know that I've really been wanting this album.  Well, I now have it, and I am quite pleased.  My friend Chris said that this is Maiden's most underrated album, and I definitely agree.  Ah, 1986, what a year it was.  Reagan was in the White House, &quot;Top Gun&quot; was drawing in the big bucks in the box office, and some of metal's greatest bands were putting out one masterpiece after another.  Yes, there were many great albums that came out in that year (&quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, &quot;Among the Living&quot;, &quot;Peace Sells...&quot;), but I believe that this album here beats them all.  This album just has a feel to it, I can't explain it.  I don't know if it's an &quot;80's feel&quot; or a &quot;futuristic feel&quot; or what, but it's just amazing.  Before you roll your eyes and call me stupid, I know it's because of the synth.  While many may have been turned off by it, I think it adds something.  I'm not sure what, but it does.  I love every song on here, but I think the one that stands out the most would have to be &quot;Wasted Years&quot;.  This was one of the first Maiden songs I ever heard, and I instantly fell in love with it.  I knew this was a band that I had to know more about.  Bruce Dickinson's vocals shine more than ever on this one.  He may not be a very big guy (about 5'6&quot;, around 140 pounds, I'd guess), but he has more power and emotion in his voice than a man twice his size.  Then, there's the music.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because this is a slightly slower, more melodic album than previous releases, it's any less technical.  The songs are all very long, and the music is as complex and dazzling as ever.  Dave Murray and Adrian Smith prove once again that they are two of the greatest guitarists on the planet, cranking out solos that Dave Mustaine couldn't do on his best day.  Steve Harris does a remarkable job of keeping up with the guitar (but not just following it, he's doing his own thing), and Nicko's drumming is at its peak.  Top that off with some really cool, thought provoking lyrics and an awesome album cover, and you've got what is simply one of the greatest albums ever made.  I think this album is way better than &quot;7th Son&quot; or &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; (although those are both great albums), and almost as good as &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  The only complaint I could make about this album is that &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; get a bit repetitive on the choruses, but that's probably being too picky.  Everything else about the album is perfect.  I don't see how anyone can call themselves an Iron Maiden fan if they don't like this album.  It is truly a work of art.it, he's doing his own thing), and Nicko's drumming is at its peak.

0316777722|5.0|The first time I ever heard of or saw David Sedaris was when he went on the Late Show with David Letterman and read an excerpt from Me Talk Pretty One Day. I laughed so hard I almost threw up and the next day, I went on Amazon.com and ordered this book. <br />I read it in about 3 days, and it is one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read in my life. This book is a classic. The way he tells stories is unbelievable and it is impossible to put this book down unless you're really hungry or you have to use the bathroom. [....] Sedaris is the wittiest writer that I can think of and his book was so amazing that I ordered Barrel Fever and Naked the same day I finished it. <br />It is a great book to pick out stories from and read them out loud to your friends or family. The only problem with reading them out loud is that you'll probably start to laugh while reading it and have to pause for a moment while you catch your breath.
6300183211|5.0|Loved this movie.  Very colorful, intense and exciting.  Al Pacino is terrific as Tony Montana and shows many different sides to the character.  Even though he's a gangster, he comes across as likeable.  Parts of the movie were hilarious and I don't think all of it was really meant to be taken seriously. Also has a very good supporting cast.  Some great acting and a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
0553106635|3.0|i believe, and agree with those reviewers who have already noted, that the carnage of major characters is excessive and frustrating. by the same token, i disagree with many reviewers who claims that the slow pace was geared towards 'character development'. how far can you develop a character when he/she's been killed? at the same time, Martin's starting to include new characters, that i suppose, are waiting to die.<br />IMO, the wholesale slaughter of major characters, especially in this third book, is really disruptive. i have a tough time getting involved with the story simply because i couldn't identify any of the characters. the book really doesn't allow for it with its myriad of 'dead'ends and it jumps way too quickly from one character to the next. by the middle of the aSoS, it no longer shocked me who died as i expect the majority of them not to survive. <br />the foil of the Knight of Flowers to Jaime could be interesting but i'm sure one of them will die in the next book (and it wouldn't be Jaime). i also disagree about the intricate plot -- as you read or after having read through this, think of all the subplots that were basically meaningless (except perhaps for 'character development' purposes like vast portions of the Arya and even Brandon arcs). Daenerys' was about the only plotline that went anywhere.<br />granted that this story is set in a major time of unrest with warring states vieing for dominance but this was frustrating to read when you are forced to be detached. if i wanted to read about political intrigue and war tactics, there are more interesting books from historical accounts -- even these would have you identifying with the major characters. <br />i agree that Martin is meticulous about detailing the history and therefore the myth of this series (perhaps beyond meticulous); this is notable and shows his care for his 'world' and i appreciate this focus on the environs... but after three books, surprising little's been accomplished with thedirection of the characters. i hope this doesn't become like Jordan's books where it'll be another 4 years when, by book 6 or 7, Martin finally starts to unwind his meandering plot. <br />yeah, i know Martin fans are devout and a 3-star rating (average) would probably be viewed the same as 1-star but i honestly don't believe this book came close to the promise of A Game of Thrones.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite movies.  Baghdad Cafe has so many levels to it that it can truly be appreciated by everyone who has ever had to say goodbye to their best friend.
6303182577|5.0|In a time when music videos have reached epic high-tech proportions twenty-four hours a day with the flick of a switch it was a delightful afternoon for me as I sat back to re-visit a piece of high-life history with the jaundiced eye of the political cynic. I loved this video. I loved the music. Indeed, I studied the undercurrent, with the interest of political science as I've been studying it, in hopes of gaining more insight, and I did. I also had fun, and I'm sure I will have fun every time I watch it. Why is it that everyone looks so YOUNG? (sigh) From Arlo Guthrie to Richie Havens to Joan Baez to Carlos Santana to Janis Joplin to Sly and the Family Stone ah, youth is wasted on the young! And the side interviews and shots of young people wading their way through the crowds, and the over riding theme of peace, love and anti-war...anti-capitalism as well, which more recent Woodstocks have not been able to copy. Woodstock I still has much to teach us, it's not just a walk down memory lane. If you do decide to pick this up, I can only hope you have as much fun with it as I am!
0452282152|2.0|The story-line is engaging enough, but I was unimpressed with Tracy's handling of historical material and prose style. This was simply not very well written.
B000009ED0|5.0|I am an avid music listener and I know that others may not agree with what I am going to say, but this CD is the best one that Kid Rock has created so far in his talented career.  The content of what he is saying along with the melody-filled, hard-beat rythms that the band composes joins together beautifully to bring out the realness of Kid Rock.
B00004Z459|5.0|i remember hearing linkin park on the radio one time. the song playing was One step closer. i was blown away. i thought that was a great song. i downloaded it and listened to it for days. then i went on a trip to europe. i had gone out shopping with my friend and he bought the cd. one listen to it in the car and i knew that their was something special about the cd. the first time i heard it, i thought it all kind of sounded the same. but when i really listened to it, i could definetly tell that each song was unique. papercut has an excellent beginning to an album. you hear the drum solo, and then it pops right into some guitar and dj. it gives you a feel as to what you're going to be listening to. it really opens up ideas of the album. one step closer shows the aggresive side of the band. it really tells how people get ticked off and frustrated. with you was the song that caught my attention. the heavy guitar riffs in the beginning are amazing. i was blown away by the intensity that was showed in such a song. points of authority is a good mix of different genres, but not one of my favorites. crawling is one of the best songs on the album. the choruses are huge and heavy, and soulful, but the softness of the in between lyrics is haunting. its a great mix of music, and the video is amazing. runaway is a pretty good song, but nothing special. by myself is a good song. it has the workings of a hard rock song, but with more meaning. in the end is also another one that is up there with crawling. it has a video coming out. it is one of the best songs i've ever heard. words can barely describe it. just trust me, you won't regret hearing this song. a place for my head is a great song. it really gives the album a kind of lighted feel. it mixes some spanish music in with rock. its a rather cool song that most dedicated audiences would like. forgotten is the song that doesn't quite fit with the album. its a kind of odd song because every time i hear it, i like it more. it kindof grows on you. a cure for the itch is a great techno song. the beat in it is awesome. the first 50 seconds are kind of nonsense, but after that its great. pushing me away wraps up the album. it gives it a closing kind of feeling. the lyrics tell that its time to move on and don't put up with people giving you trouble. its kind of inspirational for all the people out there. the gist of it is that you should buy this album. do whatever it takes but listen to this album, and give it time. don't listen to all the trash talkers. they wouldn't know real music if it jumped up and bit them.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Die Hard, in and of itself, is a true classic. It is a staple of the action genre, and is still a thrilling motion picture 13 years after its original release. However, when you add to that everything included on this 2-disc set, you'll wonder why they didn't release this set first instead of the first &quot;bare-bones&quot; DVD. Extended scenes, outtakes, articles, brand-new (anamorphic!) transfer in 2:35-1 widescreen, Surround Sound, screenplay, trailers and TV spots, and the mega-cool edit your own scenes feature. The only downside to it is that they only give you three scenes to choose from, but it is still a one-of-a-kind option. If you a die-hard (pun intended!) about this movie, get this 2-disc set as soon as possible!
B00000BKDS|5.0|Iron Maiden broke into the world of all things metal with this stunning debut album. As far as I'm concerned Paul Dianno had far better vocal talent than Bruce ever did. All the tracks on this album are outstanding (with the exception of Remember tommorow and Strange new world) and even those are still really good! THe besst track on this album is Charlotte The Harlot which is a fast punky record which slows down and becomes mellow and deep.WOW!!!! A close second is the band's anthem &quot;Iron MAiden&quot; a clasasic in every respect. These two songs alone are well worth the money for this whole album. Think about it you  get these two tracks and seven other great songs none of which could be classed as anything below SUPERB!!! I haven't heard much of Maiden's other records but surely they can't be much better than this.  I think this album is one of my top five records of all time alongside Slipknot's self titled debut Slayer's REIGN IN BLOOD and Nirvana's Nevermind check this out and these other albums you'll be so glad you did!! ARe you still reading this? what are you waiting for? GO buy this album........NOW!!!!!!
0345404475|4.0|In this futuristic novel, Rick Deckard is a post-apocalyptic bounty hunter contracted to &quot;retire&quot; fugitive androids, who winds up searching for the quality that makes him human - this is the engine that drives Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  Surrounding the engine is a latticework of suggested alternate themes, which are introduced with spartan and objective efficiency.  The accuracy and poignancy of Dick's prescience is only fully appreciated by keeping in mind the book's publication date of 1968, which is hard to do in light of its contemporary feel.<br /> The book's accessability is heightened by Blade Runner, its cinematic interpretation, which gives the reader a sense of familiarity with Deckard's world.  The year is 2021, and the Earth has been ravaged by a nuclear war, of a forgettable albeit unavoidable origin.  Most of the Earth's &quot;normal&quot;, or genetically intact, inhabitants have long since emigrated to Mars.  What is left is a society of undesirables, either &quot;normal&quot; inhabitants with fringe employment or genetic misfits (termed &quot;chickenheads&quot;) given to schizophrenic behaviors.  It is a society addicted to 24-hour vacuous t.v broadcasts, artificial mood stimulation and a cultish brand of religion/mysticism, called &quot;Mercerism&quot;.  Most species of animals have been eliminated or rendered near extinction, making owning a &quot;real&quot; animal a symbol of social distinction.  <br /> Provision of a gratis sophisticated android servant is offered as an impetus for remaining inhabitants of Earth to emigrate to Mars; although, &quot;chickenheads&quot; are denied emigration or reproduction because of their perceived genetic inferiority.   Posing a threat to this clearly delineated social order are independently thinking androids, escaped from Mars, and reverse-migrating to Earth.  Deckard is hired to &quot;retire,&quot; or terminate the fugitive androids, who are distinguishable only by their inability to invoke empathy for other androids or living organisms.  Deckard's mission becomes confused when he begins to feel empathy for a female android, Rachael Rosen, further complicated his increasing more general antipathy to the task he performs.<br /> At its surface level, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is remarkable because of Dick's ability to project the moral difficulties posed by Tower of Babel-like advancements in technology.  Present is the luddite concern of the problem of creating technology, which becomes capable of surpassing human invention.  However, the book owes as much to Ken Kessey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962) as it does its author's ability to foresee a technological Armageddon.   The book's true concern lies in the eternal question of what it means to be human, which is compounded when humans attempt to classify individuals into clearly delineated categories and classifications.  The same concerns Kessey expressed with the psychological classification of individuals in One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest are present in Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  The difference is that Dick, in 1968, foresees the desire of individuals to be classified and receive artificial mood enhancers or detractors to deal with their classification -- a desire which emerged around the time of the millennium.  (Now, isn't everyone some classification, i.e. ADD or maniac depressive, obsessive compulsive, etc.) Whereas, the mindset of Kessey's time was to react against any attempt to classify individuals.  Also worked into the thematic stew is a curious examination of the role of religion and mysticism in the framework of an &quot;advanced&quot; society. Dick suggests the question of whether it is more important that people unite in their religious belief of a genuine religious article or whether it is merely sufficient for individuals to unite in a belief of something.  Throw in a dash of the amorality of Camus and you have Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?<br /> With a sparsity of words, Dick has created a future of moral conundrums.  It is a wonder that this work is not being contemplated, via multiple readings, by high school and college students throughout the country.
0441008356|4.0|If you watch the chapter headings carefully you will realize that Reynolds even takes the speed of light and travel times into account. He moves back and forth 20+ years to have the main characters arrive at the same point in space/time for the right reasons. I highly recommend this book but be warned, it isn't always easy to follow the science and the characters are a bit stiff.
6305076995|3.0|...this DVD, however poorly remastered, is still an important classic and vital to the purpose of understanding the Yes canon.  It's also a great opportunity to see the band in their prime.  For that alone, it's worth having.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|A dazzling combination of first-rate acting, tight dialog, and smart music. Its also great fun to see the commonalities and contrasts with the UK version offered here, and the derivative (and also excellent, perhaps superior) Showtime series here in the US. Positive and unflinching portrayals of gay life are still few and far between; don't pass this one by.<br />Note: the DVD edition does not contain any additional content not available in the VHS edition (in fact, series 2 from the UK is still only available on video). The transfer is straightforward, clean, and letterbox. Choose DVD if it suits you, as the audio really comes across much better.
B000002KOG|5.0|This album is Neil Young at his very best and is in my top ten of classic albums. it has everything, Neil's perfect voice, perfect timing,outstandingly beautiful guitar playing by Neil. The album begins with 'The emperor of Wyoming' a pretty piece of music that is quite relaxing to listen too, the next song is a real classic, 'The Loner' Neil vocals on this song is really exciting to listen too as he delivers a smooth, emotional song about a man who has not and cannot get over his lover who has left him.   The next 2 song 'If I Could Have Her Tonight', 'I've Been Waiting for You' are a really wonderful and he delivers them in a sensitive and uniquley beautiful way, that only he can, each song is like diamonds and pearls, gems or contemporary jewelr, truly solid gold. The following song 'The Old Laughing Lady' is a very pretty song with beautiful background music, he sings it so wonderfully. 'String Quartet from Whiskey' is a nice song, and like the others it has Neils unique style written all over it. The following three songs  'Here We Are in the Years', 'What Did You Do to My Life?' and  'I've Loved Her So Long' are stunningly beautiful and so delicatly sung, these songs are diamond cut perfection from Neil. And now to the last but never yhe least song 'The Last Trip to Tulsa' this song is exceptionally sensitive, so emotional, perfect guitar playing from Neil, it like a diamonds, rubies and emeralds all in on cluster, it is among the most beautiful songs that I have ever listened too, it just makes you drift to that place called paradise.  This ablum is like gold, and the lyrics are so delicatly beautiful. Yes, I love it.
0452282152|5.0|At first I didn't see the point to this book.  There wasn't much action or conflict other than Griet becoming a maid.  However, her narration was compelling and story enjoyable.  The one thing I would tell those who are looking for a thorough historical fiction peice is that this is not for you.  Although it took place in the 1660's, there was nothing to distinguish this from say the 1760's or even the 1860's.  But if you are looking for a light hearted novel about a young girl and how she draws people to her, then this is the book for you.
B000003S5H|4.0|I stumbled upon the song &quot;La Femme d'Argent&quot; by accident, on a road trip.  Fiddling with the tuner I came across the most moving music I'd heard in a long time.  While this CD is not &quot;new&quot; it is new to me, because I'm new to Air.  Never, ever have I been willing to buy an entire CD based on my love for one song, but since that one song is so wonderful I have faith that the rest of the album will be too.  The samples offered on Amazon are good, but that one song is the greatest.  Get this album like I did...dissppointed you will be not.
0783235968|5.0|This classic movie is of course adapted from W.P. Kinsella's baseball novel Shoeless Joe. And it features Kevin Costner in one of his best (if not best) roles as Ray Kinsella, a struggling Iowa farmer. He hears a voice one night in the corn fields telling him to build a baseball field. Several days later, he hears the voice again and as he looks over to the field, he sees a vision of the ball field and Shoeless Joe Jackson staring back at him. He realizes he needs to build that field, so that Joe and many other old-time players can have the chance to again play the game they love. So in spite of the odds against him and everyone (except his wife played by Amy Madigan) thinking him nuts to build it, he does it anyway.<br />He then discovers he must travel to Boston to meet reclusive 60s writer Terry Mann (James Earl Jones) and then to Minnesota to meet \\"Moonlight\\" Graham (Burt Lancaster in his last role before his death), who gave up his baseball career to become a doctor. The one thing that ties them all together is the opportunity to have that second chance to play again, and for Terry Mann to finally realize his own dreams, and for Kinsella to make amends with his dad, who he never forgave for having Shoeless Joe as his hero....<br />This is a movie about following your dream, in spite of how crazy and seemingly insurmountable they may be to pull off and a movie about getting that second chance to do what you previously loved or always wanted to do. It's one that makes me cry every time I watch it.
0451169514|5.0|Some of Stephen King's books have long set-ups that are slow and boring. IT had very long set-ups and from page 1, I was ENTRAN- CED. The first part was great ...then the long set-up with getting to know all the characters in the losers club was never boring, I especially liked the section of \\"Beverly Marsh takes a whuppin\\" Then the section of the summer of 1958 was the best, I felt like I was reliving my childhood, playing Army Fort and building dams,  Love the way this part felt like STAND BY ME.The characters were excellently drawn, and I found myself reading slower so I didn't have to finish this incredible story. Not only is it the best Stephen King book, It is, in my opinion, the best book ever written, (fiction-wise)
B00004WGYA|5.0|Never fully appreciated in their time, Duran Duran was dismissed by critics as being English pretty boys who got by on their looks and glossy music videos. Definitely a crass and very short sighted view in my opinion. &quot;Rio&quot;, their second album more than proves that wrong. Excellent and well crafted songs like the title track, the wonderfully moody &quot;Lonely In Your Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Hold Back The Rain&quot;, and the albums' other big hits &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot; and &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;. The other thing Duran Duran has never really received proper credit for is their musicianship. Listen to Nick Rhodes intricate keyboard work on &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;, Roger Taylor's drumming and Andy Taylor's rhythm guitar on &quot;My Own Way&quot;, John Taylor's great Chic-influenced bass playing throughout the entire album, and Simon Le Bon's vocals. Even without the visuals, this is great pop music, something that can't be said for many of their contemporaries. Very nicely remastered, this album has never sounded this good on CD.  The limited edition package is great also, fully restoring Patrick Nagel's beautiful illustration and Assorted Images classy cover graphics(printed in the correct colors for a change!!!). Though the original album package was a single pocket sleeve, this version is a gatefold with the original dust sleeve photo printed inside. The graphics used for the British 12&quot; of &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot; have been used for the inner dust sleeve(nice touch). A great pop album that has just gotten better with time.
B000002G8J|5.0|This is a great album for anyone who likes subtle, home-style music.  This is from a period when Clapton was heavily influenced by country music and wanted to incorporate it into his work.  Don't let this scare you, though.  This album is still a rock 'n roll album, but it just takes a much more laid back approach to it.  This album shies away from the &quot;Clapton is God&quot; mystique.  It isn't forced, and Clapton isn't feeling obligated to be the guitar hero anymore.  There is still great guitar work in it, but it blends in naturally and smoothly.  This is one of my all-time favorite Clapton albums (Among the 17 or so that I own).
B000000P17|4.0|Now, I think that this is at the bottom of the list of the best Guns N' Roses CDs out there but it is awesome for what it has. They still had the attitude of their other CDs only they were singing covers. I don't think that this is worthy of 5 stars because of the fact that these are covers and not G N' R originals (they could probably pass as originals though by the way they sing them) but I give it 4 because I love it and, well, it's Guns N' Roses. The best part about it is they don't butcher the songs like other crappy bands that sing covers. Get it if you love Guns N' Roses, if you like the originals, listen to the samples then get it if you like it. This CD is not for everyone, but it is too cool.
B000023X9W|5.0|For once, the critics are right on.  If you love either &quot;Harvest&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, or both, you owe it to yourself to pick up &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot;.  It's Neil and his harmonica at his acoustic best with flavors of bluegrass and country occasionally thrown in.  This is the follow-up to &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; I hoped for back in '92.  I'll take it and love it a decade later.
B000002JSN|5.0|This album is great because it shows how versatile and talented these four guys really were.  On Led Zepp's previous albums you were able to see that they liked to use different influences of music in their work (a good example of this is LZ III because it was mostly an acoustic work that proved to the world that Zeppelin was not just a heavy metal band).  But, &quot;Physical Graffitti&quot; is perhaps their most musically diverse.  It ranges from the hard rock masterpiece that is &quot;Kashmir&quot; to the blues jam that is &quot;boogie with Stu&quot; to one of the greatest acoustic guitar compositions of all time (at least in my opinion) that is &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur.&quot;  Bron-Yr-Aur was actually written around the same time that Led Zeppelin were recording III.  It was inspired by Page and Plant's walk down to a Welsh Cottage called Bron-Yr-Aur.  Another great song on this double album is &quot;Black Country Woman.&quot;  It builds momentum and then gets really exciting when Bonzo crashes in on the drums.  All of the members of Zeppelin were able to shine brightly on this one.  John Paul Jones has an incredible mandolin solo on &quot;boogie with stu.&quot;  If you're going to get just one Zeppelin album I would say get this one or IV.  And by the way, I think this album is as good as LZ4 because there are so many quality songs on this album and they're all so beautiful.  This is a great double album, I can't say enough to explain how good it really is so you'll just have to buy it yourself to find out.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is entertaining and inspiring. The narrator, Scout, is the daughter of a proud lawyer who's newest case is to defend a gentle black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of a crime he didn't commmit. Although I did find it to be a little slow at times, this novel definitely taught me a lesson. Mockingbirds represent the childhood innocence that we are all born with, and &quot;to shoot a mockingbird is a sin, because they don't dig up our gardens or bother us... just sing their hearts out for us.&quot; A simple, bittersweet story that is honest and truthful.
B000002LRX|5.0|So, its summer of '90 and Im at the Shorline in Mountain View, anxiously awaiting this highly talked about band, Faith No More, come on and play.  I listed to about 45 minutes of their music, without even the slightest understanding of them.  I had to buy The Real Thing, and listen to it maybe 5 times, and I was a die hard fan.  <br />Mike Patton is a certified lunatic, with his interest in transexuals (See the video for \\"Easy\\") to drinking his own ... out of his shoe at a Mr. Bungle show, theres really no question.  But what else isn't in question is the sheer genious of the guy, this album is so good.  Its hard to describe.   Everything fits so well, a band with this kind of intelligence, creativity, and genious is extinct.  The melody of the whole thing, the way the keyboards fit in so well with the guitar riffs, the warm sound of the drums, its just awesome.  No other band has even come close to the kind of production we have here.<br />It is true, nothing lasts forever.  This was the most creative band of all time.  This was their hands down masterpiece.
0140187650|5.0|I first read this book 20+ years ago in my senior year of college, in  a political theory seminar on Arendt, and have re-read it from time to time ever since.  The seminar professor offered a keg of beer to anyone who could find the phrase &quot;banality of evil&quot; in the text of the book (NOT the cover, in Arendt's text).  No one won the keg because Arendt NEVER USES the phrase banality of evil anywhere in the book, and she was NOT saying evil is banal.  What she was trying to drive at is that you don't need a raver like Hitler, or an obvious monster with long fangs, to do evil -- that ordinary people, the kind you live next door to or pass on the street every day without a second thought -- can do tremendous evil.  it's a conclusion that I agree with in my brain but still grapple with emotionally.<br />I'm also grateful to her because this book is the first place where she recounted the story of the Danish Jews, who were protected by just about the entire population of Denmark when the Nazis tried to round them up.
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman has mastered the art of storytelling, and it shines through with his latest (and best), &quot;American Gods.&quot;  Few books over the past decade have demonstrated the incredible, unadultured story-telling displayed in this one.<br />Some will be offended, some will think that Gaiman is trying to make a point about religion or about American culture.  He is not.  Do not fool yourselves into believing this.  The fact is, &quot;American Gods&quot; is nothing more than a story with no pretenses.  It is being told not as social criticism but just for the sake of telling it.  One can tell when reading &quot;American Gods&quot; that Gaiman plucked the idea out of the air.  In fact, he has as much as said so.<br />Gaiman said the idea came to him when he wondered one day what happened to all the gods that immigrants worshipped in their home countries.  He wondered whatever happened to all the Nordish, Irish, Indian, etc. gods that ceased to be worshipped over time when the immigrants arrived in the New World.  This is the result of that nagging question.  The gods, we find out, are still here.  And they are not immortals, as we once thought.  They survive, most with menial, anonymous lifestyles (some are taxi drivers, drunkards, whores, slaughterhouse workers, undertakers, etc.).  Their menial, underground existence is due to a lack in belief and sacrifices.  Their influence and power is being replaced by a new legion of gods - those of technology and television.  Somehow, the old and the new were coexisting peacefully.  Now, though, a storm is brewing.<br />Enter Shadow, a relatively good-hearted convict whose entire life is thrown upside down upon upon his release.  Shadow is recruited to be a bodyguard for a mysterious man named Wednesday whom he finds is one of the old gods.  Shadow is payed to not ask questions and to do what Wednesday asks.  It becomes tougher and tougher to do so, however, as events play out around him and start to involve him in ways he could not have fathomed.  Soon, Shadow finds his role as bodyguard expanding until he is in the middle of the war himself.  As the war escalates, his role becomes more and more confusing.  And then-<br />Well you'll just have to read to find out, now won't you?  &quot;American Gods&quot; is one of those books you can't put down at any point.  Every page is a treasure to read.  There are no dull points and the story does not wait to begin as in some books.  It is constantly pushing, constantly answering questions while posing new ones.  As you follow Shadow's skeptical view of the impossible events around him, you are on the edge of your seat.  Shadow is a hero you can like, identify with, and believe.

0345350499|5.0|There are a lot of reviews here, but I had to add my own and say  that &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; was the best book I ever read in my entire life, and I've read a lot of books. I never wanted the story to end, and to this day, almost ten years after my first reading, I still picture so many of the scenes. It is an awesome story driven by brilliant female characters, a beautiful saga filled with spirituality. Just thinking about this book brings back that wonderful, contented feeling I had while I was reading it. Marion Zimmer Bradley, wherever you are now, blessed be.
0385501560|5.0|I sat down and read this book in a day.  I haven't read &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot; yet.  I read &quot;Survivor&quot;, because I liked &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  I read &quot;Fight Club&quot; because I liked the movie.  I've enjoyed everything that Mr. Palahniuk has written for two main reasons, (i) I am part of the generation that he seeks to capture, caught in a culture that seems at times pointless and absurd, and (ii) you never know what to expect from his plot.<br />Another reviewer mentioned how tough it is to review one of Mr. Palahniuk's books - I couldn't agree more.  While I really enjoyed this book, part of that enjoyment came from its unpredictability, an element all to easily given away in a review.  I won't do that.  I do think that the only way to evaluate one of Mr. Palahniuk's books is by comparing it to his other books, and of the two I've read, this is the second best.  Nothing to do with its quality, just that I think &quot;Fight Club&quot; was really good, and I'm also probably biased there by the quality of the movie.  Victor, the lead character in &quot;Choke&quot; is as compelling as was Jack in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and is much more enjoyable than was Tender Branson of &quot;Survivor.&quot;<br />This book is a much more personal plot, driven around Victor's search, than it is a plot about changing the world.  One almost wonders if Victor takes his name from Viktor Frankl, author of &quot;Man's Search for Meaning&quot; (a great book).  Victor spends the whole book searching for an answer to his mother's illness, an understanding of who he is, and a sense of purpose in the middle of a confusing world.<br />If you've read Palahniuk's works and enjoyed them, then I can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy &quot;Choke.&quot;  All of his style and wit are on display, creating a very enjoyable book.  If you haven't read anything by Palahniuk, this isn't a bad book with which to start, no concerns over having seen the movie (&quot;Fightclub&quot;) or outrageous, all-encompassing plots (&quot;Survivor&quot;).  I very much enjoyed this book, and couldn't endorse it any more heavily than I am.outrageous, all-encompassing plots (&quot;Survivor&quot;).

1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby catches the mood of the moment as he trounces his way through the life and loves of Rob, out of touch music shop proprietor. With an irreverent style and an eye for the detail, Hornby tells the story from Rob's viewpoint, and the reader soon gets to understand that he is just an overgrown teenager who has never quite managed the final step into adulthood. Rob's relations with his co-workers adds humour to this excellent book, whilst his failed relationships just keep adding up and leave you wondering if he'll ever grow up.<br />Nick Hornby has developed a finely tuned pen and uses it to it best abilities in High Fidelity. The book is one of a rare breed that is thoughtful, witty, intelligent and hard to put down.
B000002IMG|4.0|I must say they can hold good melody. Very fast songs howweer, with a lot of melody and heaviness. Chuck Billy's singing is very good, and I love the guitar playing by Alex. &quot;Disiclples of the Watch&quot; and &quot;The New Order&quot; are my favorites. There's also a Aerosmith cover. &quot;Nobody's Fault&quot; from 1976's Rocks. Very nice, yet very short. Only 39 minutes. Oh well.

B00000099Y|5.0|This album is the best album of the 90's. Bar none. It expresses the mass dicontent with society and the preasures that bond us to our consumer driven society. It speaks the truth.
0380788624|5.0|First off, I have to say that I loved this book.  I have told just about everyone that I know to read it.  It has gotten me interested in World War II history, cryptography and what the heck is exactly going on inside these boxes we use to email our friends and look up porn.<br />I'm rather surprised at a lot of the dissenting opinions about Cryptonomicon.  It seems that a lot of what people were annoyed with, I liked the most.  I liked that the author chose to explore all the details about how to dig a tunnel in Phillipine mountains and how the mathematical algorithms generate the crytography in the book and even the four page description of how to eat a bowl of Cap'n Crunch.  I think that not talking down to the reader is an admirable quality, and I liked learning some new things while enjoying the story and characters.   <br />Neal Stephenson does a great job maintaining a constant level of tension throughout the book by jumping back and forth between the present an WWII.  He does a great job balancing these two ongoing (but connected) storylines and they both maintain the same level of interest.  Oh, and it's often hilarious.  Graphing the intellectual productivity vs. time since last orgasm of one of the major characters is just one of the many funny moments.<br />I can't wait for the next installment to come out, this is going to be one of the greatest SF/fantasy series out there, ranking up there with the Illumitatus Trilogy.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Great movie. Very funny with great actors. Check this movie out for a great evening.
B00005B36H|5.0|Do you remember when pop music used to actually be pop music?<br />It used to be that bands knew how to write short, fun little ditties that were fun to sing along with, catchy, efficient little tunes with a nice steady beat.  This used to be what we'd get on the radio.<br />This used to be the standard.  Sure, occasionally they couldn't quite reach that 40 minute mark to make it worth a full-length album, and then they'd stretch out a song or two, or throw on a few filler tracks, but that'd be about it.<br />But everyone could do it, or they didn't get as far as releasing an album and are long forgotten.  Johnny and the Fins, The Springboards, The Rolling Stones, Martin and the Fins, Tommy and the Tails, Simon and Garfunkel, we'll be hearing their music forever.<br />Not anymore.  Those days are long, long gone, atleast if we use the new release by Tool as our signpost.<br />Maynard James Keenan and band cannot seem to get the hang of the simple pop song.  Many of the songs that fill Lateralus (which isn't even a word, I checked) last longer than even four minutes. And I've listening to this disc almost all of the way through almost twice and nary a tune has gotten stuck in my head.  And it doesn't stop there, the words are garbled, the drummer can't even stick to a single time signature... the problems with this album as a whole are far too numerous to name off one by one.<br />But then there are the songs to deal with.<br />Ok, I decided to try and give them a chance.  I decided to listen to the first three minutes of each song and see if maybe they just forgot to stop recording.<br />This was a disaster.<br />The vocals on the first song &quot;The Grudge&quot; didn't even start until a third of the way in.  And then it just ended abruptly as I jumped to the next track at the three-minute mark.<br />&quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; was no better; it didn't even reach the three minute mark.<br />These songs, actually, were followed by yet another song that didn't start until a third of the way through the first three minutes (it ended in the middle of a word this time!) and another song that didn't come close to reaching the three minute mark.<br />It was then that I realized that Tool is so bad at writing good efficient pop songs that their 8-minute epics need a second track of a minute or two afterwards to finish things up.<br />So then I programmed my CD player to do tracks 5 and 6 together, I was going to listen to the entire songs.  I figured that if I was going to review this album, I'd atleast listen to a few songs completely.<br />Big mistake.  &quot;Schism&quot; had a nice little bass line but it was about doing math puzzles or something (&quot;I've done the math enough to know that the pieces fit&quot;), which just doesn't interest me at all.  And then the add-on song that followed, &quot;Parabol&quot; actually was only just a hair over 3 minutes long but it not only had nothing to do with &quot;Schism&quot; at all, it ended in the middle of a guitar swell, all on it's own!  I didn't do it this time!<br />Next up after &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Parabol&quot; came &quot;Parabola&quot; and &quot;Ticks and Leeches,&quot; otherwise known as more math and just plain yuck, so I skipped them entirely.<br />The 9th track, &quot;Lateralis&quot; (It's not a word, so it's easy to see how they misspelled it), well, that was another story.  This time the singer waited until the song was more than half over to start singing, but I actually liked it, despite the rhythm section hitting on weird beats and such.  Then came the verse, something about &quot;over-thinking and over-analyzing&quot; which often is a problem of mine, so I was quite intrigued.  But then we reached the three minute mark and I had to move on.<br />I started Track 10 but before it even ended I realized that it wasn't going to get any better.  I mean, I had listened to almost the entire album up to this point, and it wasn't getting it done for me.<br />And anyway, &quot;Lateralis&quot; is an appropriate stopping point, as it is quite representative of the album, and, in fact, I suggest that you listen to just &quot;Lateralis&quot; rather than all of Lateralus to judge this album, for like Lateralus, &quot;Lateralis&quot; sounds pretty good and could be going somewhere, but in the end result (after three minutes, that is) it hasn't really gone anywhere.<br />So if you must listen to this obviously badly crafted album, remember that the pain you feel is only an illusion....

0452282152|5.0|It's been a while since I read a novel within 24 hours but Chevalier's &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; had me enthralled.  This imaginary title inspired by the Dutch Vermeer's 17th century piece of the same name left me with such an echoic presence that I could read it again, just as I could stare at the mysterious painting for hours.  The fascination of the parallels of religious families, the unquestioned oppressive role of females and the cleanliness of this novel's dialogue (no flowery prose about sunsets or night skies to lengthen it) made it worthy of a reader's time.  Griet's vivid descriptions of her sister, of Pieter the son and of the market square star left me feeling as though I were still in that not-quite-there age of seventeen myself. &quot;I knew before he did.  When I saw what was needed - that point of brightness he had used to catch the eye in other paintings - I shivered.  This will be the end, I thought.  I was right&quot; Beautiful.
0140433627|4.0|Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has the odd honour of having an unnamed monster which gets confused with the protagonist (afterall everyone calls the monster FRANKENSTEIN when he is unnamed), but the merging of identities and names is at the heart of this classic. Questions about creation, the limits of human knowledge and actions are explored, as well as what is human and what is not. Shelley's protagonist Frankenstein slowly reveals the harsh and cruel side of himself as the novel progresses, while the monster he creates takes on more human traits expressed in his guilt at the murder of the child, and his desire for a companion to ease his lonely days. At the end of the novel, it appears that the roles have reversed. Frankenstein's personality takes on a more &quot;monstrous&quot; aspect while the monster gradually attains the readers' sympathy. The monster and the human therefore switch positions and we have to question and relook what we define as &quot;human&quot; or otherwise. The story on intertwined fates and dependence reaches a tragic end as the release for both monster and creator is possible only through death.
B000002UUX|5.0|This album was my introduction to this talented and intriguing quartet. I vividly recollect some ten years ago in High School, a classmate fell prey to a prank when, once the lesson was concluded, someone sneaked into his bag and pressed the play button on his powerful ghettoblaster (don't ask me why he had a ghettoblaster at school with him... such an item simply isn't allowed into school premises here in the UK ). When that play button went down, this music could be heard reverberating everywhere, and it caused all sorts of confusion; entangled were laughter, fright and curiosity ( it really was like the scene from a film! ) The emotion I was experiencing was definitely excitement, and I asked myself, &quot;Who is this band?!&quot; I was completely in awe of the music as I had never heard anything so dynamic; it had its own majestic, unique sound and was masterfully executed. I had to find out who these genuises were...<br />Well here I am, after ten years, offering my first written review of the album which happened to be in the &quot;prank victim's&quot; ghettoblaster: Megadeth's &quot;Rust In Peace&quot;. ( The music that was playing in his ghettoblaster at the time, incidentally, was the main riff to &quot;Holy Wars&quot;. ) Everything about this album emits sheer quality; the rhythm guitar playing, lead guitar playing, bass guitar playing, drum work, lyrics, singing ( yes, I said singing! ), production. Hell, even Edward J. Repka's cover illustration for this album is unparalleled! Dave Mustaine got his act together for this one, and it unquestionably showed; Mustaine and Ellefson made a concerted effort to quit drugs, and jettisoned the other 50% of the band ( Jeff Young on lead guitar and Chuck Behler on drums ) for guitar maestro, Marty Friedman and the gifted drummer, Nick Menza. With this new cohesive lineup, Megadeth's cooks definitely did &quot;not&quot; spoil the broth, and made big waves with Rust - regarded by the majority to be the band's finest hour.<br />The opening two tracks from the album are, perhaps, the strongest. &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot;, the album's opener, is my all time favourite 'Deth track, and is easily one of the band's most recognisible songs; this song demonstrates a unique marriage of intensity and articulation, and I just love the contrasting tempos between &quot;Holy Wars&quot; and the second part of the composition - &quot;The Punshment Due&quot;. I can wholeheartedly say that this song has never been surpassed by any band in any genre of Heavy Metal. Amazingly, the second track from Rust is possibly the band's second best ever song - &quot;Hangar 18&quot;. Again, this is another song that put Megadeth on the map, and is another one of their most recognisible songs. Okay, so you're thinking that an album can't keep up with two of its best songs, but rest assured,it by no means falters; the beauty with this album lies in its ability to keep up and never lose any focus or any sense of urgency.<br />&quot;Rust In Peace&quot; is a compulsory part of Heavy Metal, surely placed in the &quot;elite&quot; category. For intense, complex and catchy music, this album has it in spades ( although it may take some time to fully appreciate its quality ). I say this because of the album's complexity and the fact that Dave Mustaine's vocals are very unusual - very anguished, energetic and high-pitched( you could tell he wanted to sing on this album, unlike the previous albums). Concluding my review, I'd just like to reiterate that this album's two most important ingredients are intensity and articulation - the notes seem to fit like dovetail joints even though they're being played very fast. A truly majestic album.
B000002HPT|3.0|Ok- this is simple, you either love this album or you don't. If you love it, then you like radio music. If you don't, then you love progressive rock, and the likes of Yes, Rush, ELP, etc. <br />This is by far DT's weakest prog outing. By their own admission, DT changed directions and tried to write a more radio-friendly albumn. That's ok for Britney Spears, but unfortunately for Dream Theater it sacrifices the prog aspect of their music, which is what I buy their music for. I can buy a million other albums at any music store and get radio-friendly music. I buy DT because they're the best musicians on the planet, and when they want to write great music, they can. Radio-friendly music is NOT their forte...<br />That said, I don't despise this albumn. It has it's prog moments. Unfortunately those moments are split-up by other songs that attempt to be radio-friendly, and really just aren't special. My track-by-track assessment: <br />1. New Millennium - Decent song with some nice textures. Too long for radio, but lacking the dynamics of a great prog piece. Still a nice track. <br />2. You Not Me - Radio attempt #1. Typical, predictable. The antithesis of prog. Move along...<br />3. Peruvian Skies - Halfway interesting. Predictable to a point, then shifts gears near the final 1/3 of the song. Even with the shift, it's still a boring song to listen to. Adventure is dead here. <br />4. Hollow Years - A decent ballad with some interesting lyrics. Predictable though, like any other radio tune.  <br />5. Burning My Soul - a terrible attempt to be Metallica with more bass. This was the first release, and when I heard it on the radio prior to buying the albumn I almost cried with dissapointment. I hoped it was the only track of this poor quality, unfortunately it was not. This song completely lacks any real adventure, and is probably more predictable than Metallica. <br />6. Hell's Kitchen - Great instrumental lead-in to the next track. The first really inspiring piece of musicon the album. <br />7. Lines in the Sand - The first mini epic on the album. The addition of the singer from Kings X adds some diversity to this track. I like the arrangement, textures, and melodies. The first real decent &quot;prog&quot; track on the album. <br />8. Take Away My Pain - Ballad, and sappy. Again, predictable to the point where you'll know the next lyrics before LeBrea sings them. There's nothing interesting in this piece, and it's unfortunate because listening to it I felt like this song actually had a chance to be an inventive ballad. <br />9. Just Let Me Breathe - a parody? of Take the Time, this song should never have made it on the album. It's just terrible. The only thing I can think of is that the band made it for fun and Shirly somehow snuck it on the album without permission. <br />10. Anna Lee - Ballad (should rename this album to &quot;Falling Into Ballad-land&quot;) The piano work is catchy, but again, this song lacks any adventure. It goes nowhere, and is completely predictable from the first moment. When it ends, it will seem as if nothing happened. <br />11. Trial of Tears/It's Raining/Deep in Heaven/The Wasteland - The epic of the album, and the best song. Great intro, decent changes. This is the stuff that leaves a prog fan like myself going &quot;Why couldn't we have more of that?&quot; The answer, of course, is the power of radio to influence a band and a producer. <br />The trick to any review is this: Will this review help you? In order for a review to help you, you need to know what kind of music YOU like, and what kind of music is on the album. <br />If you're a casual DT fan who enjoys the more basic DT songs from past albumns and doesn't care for the adventurous, dynamic, and creative compositions of the more progressive DT songs, then get this album. You'll likely be very happy you did. <br />However, if you're a prog fan and are looking for a DT release like &quot;Image &amp; Words&quot;, full of diverse progressive compositions and great technical passages mixed with emotional melodies, then forget this album (or buy it and understand you're only going to enjoy about 3-4 songs).
0684833395|5.0|This is a great book. In fact it's such a great book that I decided to read IT instead of the one my teacher assigned. Well worth it! If you like writers who make fun of human stupidity, along with making fun of a lot of other things, this is the book for you.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Back in July 2001, when the soundtrack came out I checked it out and hated it. My thought back then was, if it were not for the David Bowie, the Fat Boy Slim or the Beck tunes, I'd give the album a ONE! However, now that I've seen the movie, the soundtrack (which is packed with versions of pop songs from all times) makes a lot more sense. I have to say that if you haven't seen the movie, you might have a hard time getting used to it, but otherwise, you'll find it very enjoyable.
B000002LLC|5.0|This soundtrack didn't last very long on the charts, but I think was a great soundtrack.  The soundtrack to &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, has a lot of great music.  One of Madonna's biggest hits came from this soundtrack &quot;Vogue&quot; became an instant classic and started people vogueing and went on to sell over 4 million copies of the single, &quot;Vogue&quot; makes the movie come to life, and the video is just so memorable.  There are other gems on this album, like &quot;He's A Man&quot;, &quot;Now I'm Following You&quot;, and &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; which did fairly well hitting the top 10, and the song that puts this album on another level is the Oscar Award nominated, &quot;Sooner Or Later&quot;, Madonna put every breath she had into this song.  This album should've lasted longer but remained on the album chart for only 24 weeks.  This was another good soundtrack from Madonna and again one of her best although all of her albums are great.  Grade B.
B000021XS0|5.0|I can't really write anything to add to the comments already posted here except to say: This is without a doubt one of the best albums of the last 100 years. <br />I've been a DT fan since Images and Words. Unfortunately, the albums that followed were less-than-stellar. Falling Into Infinity was the low point, and showed why a guy like Kevin Shirly shouldn't be producing progressive rock bands like DT. After that album I felt like perhaps DT was going to go the way of so many other bands I enjoyed, leaving behind creativity for radio-stardom. <br />Fortunately, for me and many other fans, Dream Theater has returned to their roots of creative, emotional, experimental prog. <br />I don't give 5 stars, typically, unless I feel the album is perfect. This one is. Every single song is a work of art, a wonderful journey waiting for the listener.<br />It's pretty simple: Any negative reviews of this album can be disregarded, because those people don't get it. If you're into prog and haven't heard this album yet (you're living in a cave aren't you?) then go buy it. You can't be dissapointed. <br />Thanks DT.
B00000258J|5.0|Johnny Winter obviously had a vision in mind when he produced this album.  This is what newer blues artists want to sound like, and older blues artist could have potentially sounded like.  Winter created a Muddy Waters album that somehow sounds more like Muddy, capturing the fury, the soulfullnes, and the fire better than previous, more &quot;authentic&quot; albums.  Anyone who doubts that rock and roll is just bastardized blues should give this a listen.
B000002KAT|3.0|While I'm generally a big advocate of less (production) is more (e.g. Exile on Main Street), this album really strikes me as more of an ambitious work in progress than a fully realized masterwork.  No doubt that in 1968, it was sufficiently innovative (and passionate) that, given Morrison's great voice (and the solid instrumental accompaniment), it was praised by critics upon its release.  Still, in my view, a disc like St. Dominic's Preview is a better pick for the neophyte Morrison fan than this one.  On Preview, the longer jams (reminiscent of most of Astral) are simply better developed; in fact they seem like natural extensions (and improvements) of the themes laid down here.  Moreover, Preview also showcases some of Van's other considerable strengths (e.g. straight ahead R&amp;B).  All real Morrison fans must, of course, own this disc, and indeed all music lovers are likely to find moments of real pleasure in it.  Perhaps ironically, while some might feel that this is Morrison's most adventurous work, the disc has a consistency of sound that, to me, makes it more timid than several other discs on which he is willing to showcase a greater diversity of talents and musical interests (e.g. Preview, Moondance).
B000002LCD|5.0|This was my first soundtrack I ever bought, back in 1987, and I loved it actually I had two copies because the first one wore out.  &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;, is a good soundtrack, the four Madonna songs are all great, and I also liked the movie.  Let's start with the title song, a very innocent side of Madonna, Madonna shows a more sweet side and I love the video.  &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;, the song is one of Madonna's sweetest.  &quot;Causing A Commotion&quot;, is a song I could listen to over and over again, it's just an awesome song.  Next there is &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, which is again very nice to listen to, it's a very dancey tune.  And finally there is &quot;The Look Of Love&quot;, this a dark and mysterious sounding song, this is one of Madonna's ballads, and in my eyes should've been released as a single.  This soundtrack is very good despite what other people say, and a very good buy for my Madonna collection.  The album gets a B+.
B00005JG6Q|2.0|I am really disappointed in this DVD.  The sound effects and music where done great but the &quot;New&quot; dubbing I found lacking.  First of all, this is a classic that has been around for over 10 years.  They should have included an option to hear the dubbing we have all grown to know and love.  The new dubbing isn't offal but I enjoy the original dubbing far better.  If they already had the dubbing available, how hard could it have been to include a choice to hear that too?  If you like Akira in original Japanese, then you should like this DVD but if you want to relive the movie you saw as a kid, try the VCD.............
B00003CXN4|5.0|This film should serve as a wake up call for our complete defeat in the drug war.  Drugs are terrible but have always and will always exist and this film perfectly outlines that point.  Amazing performances all around.  I hope the real drug tsar owns this film.
0141301104|5.0|Another Roald Dahl classic that I read as a child and now have shared with my 8 year old stepson (who can't wait to read the next one).<br />This is again more of a scary story adventure style childrens novel (about witches who turn children into mice and into hotdogs so their parents will eat them.<br />The story is of course illustrated with both adult and childish humor (its obviously meant to be shared).<br />Read this one with your kids, even the five year old one would come to listen.  (that might be because of the voices I used)
B000002NAK|5.0|Madonna hit all the right notes on this terrific soundtrack to the sorely underappreciated &quot;Evita&quot; movie the soundtrack in brilliant and Madonna's voice is out of this world.  Madonna's really told this project serious and what came out is some really great music.  Madonna's version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; and &quot;A New Argentina&quot; are outstanding!  Putting her voice to the test and passing with flying colors.  The ever catchy &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; ended up being a dance hit, but then again which Madonna song hasn't been a dance hit.  And then there is &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, where Madonna showcase amazing vocal presence, this is one song you can feel the emotion, experince the pain in Madonna's voice, this a very powerful song.  Madonna has every reasong to be proud of her &quot;Evita&quot; projects, the soundtrack is excellent the movie was worth seeing and she now has a Golden Globe to prove it, and critical acclaim for this soundtrack.  A+
B00004SCX6|2.0|I must admit, this cd was a huge disappointment.  Britney needs to learn what the word &quot;diversification&quot; means.  All her songs sound the same....
B00005B36H|5.0|From the opening beat of &quot;The Grudge&quot;, I knew that this cd was going to blow away every expectation I had.  The drumming and the guitar work in the first track was unbelievable, with Maynard's beautiful vocals searing through the hammering beat, like an unstoppable fire in the midst of a blizzard. An awesome opening to this seemingly flawless album.  The next track &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Mantra&quot; are both instrumental, and they slow down the album a little.  While in between them lies &quot;The Patient&quot; which starts slow, but explodes into a heavy song with haunting vocals.  &quot;Schism&quot; is an awesome song that has great guitar work and absolutely amazing drumming.  After their latest hit comes &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;, the former is a slow, sullen song, that eventually explodes into &quot;Parabola&quot; that has great vocals and excellent guitar work.  &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; explodes from the start with fiery drumming and then turns it up a notch when the bass and guitar kick in.  Then enters Maynard with an extremely emotional performance on possibly the best song on the album.  &quot;Lateralis&quot; begins with tribal-like drumming and picks up with thundering guitar work and Maynard's moving vocals.  The next three songs are entralling, especially &quot;Disposition&quot;, which is more of a acoustic ballad with quiet, melancholy vocals.  &quot;Reflection&quot; starts off similar to Godsmack's Voodoo, but with better drumming and bass-playing, and with more disturbing vocals and guitars.  &quot;Triad&quot; is probably the oddest song on the album that contains metal riffs with odd tribal drumming and vocal singing at the beginning, before becoming a guitar driven masterpiece.  &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; should not be listened to if you afriad of the dark, but is a great ending to this tremendous audible piece of art.<br />With incredible musicianship and odd, but compelling vocals and lyrics, this album definetly stands up to be one of the greatest metal offerings to date.  If you love profound and creative art in any form this CD should be a compelling buy.
B00004XQ83|5.0|So glad they MADE a soundtrack from this marvelous movie.  Also, I'm glad the music was extended from the movie.   You could hear the Cox Family sing somewhat over the dialogue between Ulyssus and his wife..but the CD played it all.  I adore the Cox Family and am a forever fan now.  I was shocked to find out that adorable Tim Blake Nelson really did sing &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot;.    He really has a very good voice.  Don't know exactly who the Soggy Bottom Boys are, but suppose they were invented for the movie.   Loved them.   This is one of my all time favorite CDs.  The guitar performance &quot;A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; is haunting and beautiful.  Buy the CD, the movie and a lot of the CDs by the performers.!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden undoubtedly was one of the, if not, most successful metal bands of the 80s.  Their entirely original style won the hearts and minds of metal fans worldwide during their metal ground breaking years. I don't know the facts, but I would bet a significant sum of money on a bet that says Iron Maiden, during the 80's, sold more albums then any other metal band of it's class and time.<br />During the 90's the band sort of lost me, and seemed to be fighting for survival in an industry that had turned it's back on metal, and was busy promoting the strains of less focused grunge/alternative bands.  Even Metallica sought shelter though it's, well, I want to be nice here, compromising releases, and with some marketing success.<br />However, several years later I hear some rumors about Bruce's return to IM, and that a new album of an original, yet classic Maiden theme was in the works.<br />This release sure lives up to the rumor!  I was immediately refreshed when I heard to opening guitar riff in 'Wicker Man' blasting out of the left channel of my stereo.  It appears they had regained their original raw guitar sound.  And then I heard Bruce's voice, and within moments, realized that he had retained all of his original vocal abilities, and maybe acquired a few more.<br />There is also some apparent evolution in this album as the band now adds more progressive elements to the works giving them a more sophisticated sound while FULLY retaining their roots.  This is an album that you will like immediately if you are a classic Maiden freak, and will own grow on you over time. Like many of their 80s era albums, every song on this album is good, and keeps your attention throughout its entire 60-minute+ performance.<br />A must have for true, die-hard Maiden fans, you WILL NOT be disappointed.<br />Speaking of and to Maiden fans worldwide:<br />&quot;Were blood brothers!&quot;<br />PR
B00005BJPO|4.0|Pioneer brings us (finally), an amazing transfer of this legend... However... what lacks is the presentation of sound.  If this was to be such a hell-bent collector's edition, the JAPANESE version should be in 5.1, and there should have been TWO versions in english (new and ORIGINAL dub), which could have just been in mono for all we care.  Hell, some movies have 3 language selections... they could have even made the disks 2 sided.          I'm sorry, the new dub ....  The actors (and translated lines) are VERY trite and unemotional (like your typical BAD anime), and I personally LOVE the lines added in the original English dub (ie first scene: \\"Red bennies... three of 'em..\\", \\"You got a bad attitude pops!  Lighten up before your arteries harden!\\").  This was probably done to match the subtitles, which is stupid, since two sets of subtitles could have been made; or three for that matter, like one in Japanese.        Then there's the extras disk.  You know, I LOVE it when I can't get a display on the remaining/total time on the extra features... and this is a rapidly spreading disease on many new DVDs.  It infects half the extras disk.  Also, weren't there American trailers of any sort?  I SWEAR I've seen an English trailer before.  Probably because it was the original dub.  The other complaint on the extras disk is that it has a ridiculously large amount of pictures from the comics (which are all THE EXACTLY SAME LOOKING), and almost no pix of other collectibles (my t-shirt and soundtrack are NOT listed).  Otherwise, pretty good job.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Ok, Fair Enough, Significant Other was pure quality, but give this album a chance and you will see how much class is in it. The album is purely cool and will rock any1 away. The mix of Fred Dursts lyrics and unique singing techniqure with Wes Borlands guitars and DJ Lethals decks just blew me away and i have no doubt it will blow you too....
B00000IAU3|5.0|She has a beautiful voice, the music is upbeat and fun to hear, relaxing too at times.
B00005B4GU|5.0|After creating 'OK COMPUTER', possibly one of the greatest rock albums of the '90's', and recreating their sound and music in 'KID A', 'AMNESIAC' proves to Radiohead-heads, the listening audience, and the music industry all together that lightning strikes twice, and in a BIG WAY!<br />Unorthodox in every which way, Radiohead has created another record from the 'KID A' sessions that proves not only are they incredible musicians, but intensely creative, and rock n' roll to the core. Radiohead did not &quot;destroy&quot; rock n' roll, as Rolling Stone so nicely put it. They merely recreated it. Using techno beats, other worldly sounds, and hard but simple guitar riffs, 'AMNESIAC' is but another testament to the power Radiohead puts behind their music creatively and musically.<br />And again, 'AMNESIAC' could not be described in 1,000 words or less, song by song. Like it's brother 'KID A', 'AMNESIAC' invites you to experience, not listen. Forget, and then remember, at its very core, Radiohead and their sound is the savior of Rock N' Roll. A deppreciation of pop music, a recreation of rock n' roll, and a rebirth of the music we call rock.
B000000HU0|3.0|This is when the (temporary) rot began to set in. Daevid Allen took himself, and his creativity with him. And technically proficient players were left to be technically proficient. That profiency does not extend to Mike Howlett's feeble attempt at singing. It's hard to listen to his singing on track 1 without cringing. You can hear his lack of confidence with the singing as he wavers tremulously around the required pitches. And the lyrics are mystical/new-agey without any hint of humour. That being said, it's still worth buying because the great sax player Malherbe is still with them at this point, and his two compositions, especially &quot;Cat in Clark's Shoes&quot;, are as good, and as melodic as the Allen day's stuff. They then went on to make some dreadful albums when Monsieur Malherbe called it a day to. Thankfully, all the creative personell got back together again in the 90's and are now making great albums again. (Of course, this opinion is meant for the Gong fans that like the early Daevid Allen Gong. If you're a fan of the Moerlen/Holdsworth etc Gong please don't take any offence from my comments.)
B000000OA6|5.0|This entire album is incredible, but the most powerful song, and one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written, is &quot;The Show Must Go On.&quot;  The fact that Freddy Mercury had to be held up by his band mates as he sang because he was so wracked with AIDS is a terrifying testament to our human frailty, but to listen to the song and hear the strength that he pulls out from his depths as he sings is indescribable.  It is a song that gives hope, from someone who could easily have given up and let go, but instead he left us with this beautiful reflection of how powerful the human spirit can be.
B00004LN16|5.0|One of AC/DC's best yet.  I enjoyed Dirty Deeds and when this came out I was very impressed.  This album goes in the hall of fame just like the rest of them.  May AC/DC always ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!
0345350499|5.0|This book is nothing like other fantasy novels and Arthurian legends that you may come across.  Instead, Marion Zimmer Bradley tells the story of King Arthur from a female point of view, from the perspective of Morgaine (known in most Arthurian legends as Arthur's evil half-sister Morgan le Fay).  Many of the details do relate to other Arthurian legends if you attempt to connect events, but this interpretation of events is so much more appealing than all others I've come across.  The new perspective and well-conceived plot is extremely intriguing.  In spite of the book's length, you will find it impossible to put down once you begin. <br />This book holds great depth as it explores the theme of religious tolerance.  &quot;The older I grow, the more I find that it does not matter what words we use to speak the same truths,&quot; says Talesin (Merlin).  The clashes between Christianity and Avalon are seen here, as the Christians themselves are often the narrow-mindedly condemning and foolish ones in the novel (Gwenhwyfar, otherwise known as Guinevere, being a great example of these negative qualities).  Although it may be disturbing for some Christians to see believers of Christianity behaving so, as it was for myself, there is no attack on Christianity, which is a good religion.  Instead, it attacks those who wrongly condemn others while considering their own religion superior and a basis for the rightful damnation of others.  The Goddess-based religion of Avalon is essentially the same as Christianity, also beliefs based on what is good, with many of the virtues and values of Christianity.  Reading the book makes one feel enlightened. <br />However, the book is in no way a book that preaches religious tolerance, if that is what I have made it seem.  That is merely a theme that came across to me strongly as I read the book, probably due to my circumstances back then.  Above all, the book is a great novel, long but not lengthy and with much to present to the reader. <br />I have no yet read the other Avalon books by MZB, but I have read many reviews and it appears that THE MISTS OF AVALON is the most highly praised out of all four.  So, for those who have read and disliked any of the others or for those who are wondering which book to start with, I would recommend this one.  I started with it, and it has made me want to read the others.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park is one of those mediocre bands that have paved their way following Limp Bizkits success.  After hearing Points of Authority, which is a pretty decent rock song, I said to myself &quot;what the hell&quot; and bought the album.  Money down the drain it was.  Although the first song, Papercut, isnt all that bad, everything that follows is well and truly terrible.  Linkin Park have absolutely nothing up their sleeves, this is nu-metal rock at its worst.  The bottom of the barrel is the single &quot;Crawling&quot;, where Linkin Parks dreadful singer (one of Linkin Parks singers I assume) makes your ears bleed with pointless screaming.  All in all, Hybrid Theory is an early contender for worst albums of the decade.  And surely it wont get better with time.
0783117388|5.0|Last year, I bought the first season and immediately invited a friend over to watch it.  She was doubtful at first, becasue I'm always forcing my friends to watch chick stuff that they don't really like.  By episode 2, we were junkies.<br />I'm not single, in my mid-thirties, and I've never been to New York.  Yet this is a show that truly transcends all that.  Chronic batchelors and male egotists are described hilariously, and the war between singletons and smug-marrieds is constructed in such a way that would make the Bridget gang blush.  See this and season two, and then find that friend who has HBO and make her dinner every Sunday just to keep watching.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This album is great!! There are only 3 cuss words in the album, that i have noticed. Why do they put the explicit lyrics label on there?? I have seen albums with more cuss words then that, which do not have that label.
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD is extremely good.  CCR is classic rock with a very heavy base, catchy beats, and an obvious Southern blues influence that can even be detected in the pronounciation of the lead singers.  Music like this remains classic throughout the ages...
B00005B3Z6|4.0|I absolutely loved this DVD. Their Nathan gives our Justin a run for his money on looks! Their Stewart makes our Brian seem like a puppy dog. Their Vince has such a lovely sing-song accent that I could forget all about Michael!<br />Ok, it's unfair to make these comparisons and I adore Sharon Gless but it had to be said. This is the original series (where Showtime got the idea) and it's well worth checking out. The only drawback is the lack of a scene selection menu so that if you're interrupted you have to FF through the whole bloody thing!<br />I wish there were more stories from these boys!<br />Oye! Fancy a shag?
0375703861|1.0|It's not like me not to finish a book... and the truth is I probably will, but I've been stuck mid way thru for over a week now and frankly I have no desire to pick it up again.
078322334X|4.0|This is byfar the best Jurassi Park movie so far. It puts the other ones out of the competition in my opinion Not just because more people are killed by the dinosaurs, but because the plot takes such interesting turns, it makes you just love the movie.
0671024256|4.0|If you like Steven King read this book. If you want to write Fiction or are interested in writing in any way read this book. It's definitely one of his better works but if you're sensitive when it comes to profanity be warned, he doesn't censure.
B00004SVID|3.0|This was a good CD, yea. But you might as well just listen to the original and then watch the movie, and you're getting the same thing. Floyd doesn't sound nearly as good in concert. I recommend you get the original CD and watch the movie. Much better idea than buying a highly commercialized new Pink Floyd CD that is based on past recordings.
B00000J7SS|5.0|one of my best friends, a music composition major told me...&quot;don't bother with it, you won't like it, you haven't really listened to enough jazz to understand it, and even then you probably won't like it, I bought it and I sold it back I disliked it so much&quot;...so what did I do? I went out and bought it :)!!! Awesome, this music is dark and moody. It's so colorful...if I had to describe the album with a color, I would say it's a rich dark green. Fans of early King Crimson and Early Pink Floyd will really dig this. In fact, King Crimson's first album was in ways a jazz fusion/hard rock album of sorts. I do understand how some people might not like it. It really is an album for people that are really into music. Some people say that it's discordant. I like in much in the same way that I like the dissonant, discordant ending to Pink Floyd's &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. One thing to keep in mind while listening to this is that it isn't really a jazz album, so don't go into it expecting a jazz album. Expect the most horrifyingly morbid acid trip that you've ever experienced and this might come close to expectations. This is ear candy for people that really love and understand music (namely audiophiles). Don't be narrow minded...
6303148360|4.0|Yea, yea, the actors are awful. But the dinosaurs totally outdo all of that, and you forget that the people are fakey. The plot is fine. Everything makes sense. And the T-rex is great, as are the raptors. This is where the big dinosaur adventure begins. If you're interested in it, watch it. If not, don't.
B00005BJPO|5.0|I think we've all waited long enough for this DVD! I was a little thrown at first with the new translation and voice acting since I've watched the VHS version many times. However, the story is much easier to understand and flows better. The VHS copy does no justice compared to the high quality of the anamorphic transfer. It was almost like I was watching it for the first time again. Hats off to the production team that created this well, masterpiece. I couldn't really see the detail in the VHS copy but from the foreground, background and the character animations, this is ALL cell animation! Very little CG! Very, very high quality work here. The story is deep and complex so be ready to be confused watching this for the first time. There are so many different smaller stories and plot twists going on that it can be hard to keep up with on your first sitting. The english dubbed soundtrack is remastered in Dolby 5.1 and was done very well considering that this movie is over 10 years old now. Purists beware since new foley has been added in addition to the original mix and none of the voice actors are the same as in the VHS english dubbed version. Gunfire and explosions were most prominent to me on the first viewing as sounding different and there are additional foley effects added but I liked it. I thought it hightened the realism and why not take advantage of all the improvements that current technology has to offer? This is an excellent film for those interested in grown up, in depth storytelling and you can't help but wonder if our government is doing similar experiments (I doubt with children) to bring out the powers of the mind. Who knows? That's thought provoking. Pick up this movie!
B000003TAR|5.0|They wanted an album that they could stand to listen to on a normal basis, they succeded. It's raw and it sounds live. Almost all the songs are great. Tourette's- I can't really tell what hes saying. great song Rape Me- actually an anti rape song. every single thing about this song is brilliant.  Dumb- somewhat acoustic, some of the best lyrics I've ever heard.  Heart-shaped box- (great video) Wonderful riffs, lyrics, and verses. Unforgettable. Serve the Sevants- Great way to start out the cd. Love the chorus. Milk It- Practicaly my favorite. All Apologies- Brilliant lyrics. God, such a great song.   Pennyroyal Tea- One of my favorites, even though they all are, but it sounds better acoustic.<br />It's just as good as all thier other albums (and to you complete Nevermind lovers: It's as good as that, too.) While Nevermind had better song writing, IU has better sound. A must for every rock fan. PS_ even though the album did well, I think it deserved to do even better.
B00003CXV4|2.0|I'm not one of those people who has a problem with Keanu's acting.  And I'm a pretty big fan of Charlize Theron, but this movie was pretty bad with a really bad ending.  You can watch it if you want, but it's not really worth it.
B00005B1EX|4.0|Rob Halford's new live album easily tops the similar double live release by Priest in 1998.The band behind Rob is simply ferocious ,while the songs from his comeback album are rendered with extreme precision,all feeding on the tremendous energy of the crowd.Contrary to what some have suspected, Rob Halford is still in perfect vocal  and also songwriting shape,as demonstrated by the studio cuts at the end of disc two.A mammoth comeback for a metal legend!
0452281881|5.0|This book is such a fascinating read about dirty office politics! Presented in a &quot;Dilbert-style&quot; satire format, the story will teach you all there is to know about the game of office politics. I often found myself laughing hysterically because of the fantastic humor. This is the one and only book you need to learn about the reality of the working environment. Read it! You will no doubt enjoy it!
B00000JPHF|5.0|This classic horror film introduced the nameless creature with the trademark flattop and neck bolts. The monster became forever confused with Dr. Frankenstein, his mad creator. Boris Karloff wears the fright makeup for the first time, James Whale directs from a unique perspective, and Dwight Frye gives one of his best performances as Fritz the twisted dwarf. The creaky production values add to the appeal of the film. It's like the crinkled pages of an ancient book that unfold a tale of dreadful death. The old story of tampering in God's domain of life and death is the rock on which the imitations and sequels stand. A memorable scene is the first time we see the living creature. The monster backs into the room and turns slowly to the camera. The camera cuts to three ever-tighter headshots, focusing on Karloff's haunted eyes. The creature gestures pitifully in a plea for help. Karloff's three-dimensional performance combines the menace of the monster and the human spirit within. Colin Clive is edgy as the visionary doctor teetering on the brink of insanity. On a fateful night, as he is about to extract the great ray of life itself from the lightning raging above his dark mountain retreat, visitors knock on the door. As an annoyed housewife, he mutters, \\"Of all times for somebody to come!\\" James Whale at his best. The restored version includes the controversial scene of the monster tossing the child into the lake to see if she floats. She doesn't. Angry, torch-carrying villagers pursue the killer through the grim countryside, and a great movie cliche is born. No collection of classic horror films is complete without this one. Well...we warned you! ;-)
0316286443|5.0|I've had this since the first week it came out.  Now that I've started my own business as a beauty consultant, this book has become essential to my business.  I'm always getting compliments on how beautiful my face looks. Thanks, Kevyn. You are truly a master.
B0000027K7|5.0|OK, I haven't yet heard the CD version of this album.  However, I bought the LP when it came out in 1970 and I have played it to death over the years.  It is a great, great album which is in my all time top ten.  The contrast between the rough &amp; powerful voice of Leslie West and the smooth vocals of his counterpart, Felix Papallardi (producer of Cream's &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;), helps to provide a lot of variety, texture, and balance.  Then, of course, you get West's awesome guitar work on milestones like &quot;Theme For An Imaginary Western&quot; (written by Jack Bruce), &quot;Never In My Life&quot;, and the rock super classic &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;.  There is not a bad cut on the album.  If you want to hear what heavy rock sounded like before it was reduced to distorted noise, this album is a very good choice.
B0000057C5|5.0|I wanted to write a review for those who may be put off by all of the comparsions that have been made between Rammstein and the somewhat underground European Bands like Kraftwerk, or Die Krupps, or etc.  Those bands have their good points and there are some comparsions to Rammstein, but to the typical American listner those comparisons won't mean much.  A better comparsion would be to say that these guys sound like Nine Inch Nails meets Iron Maiden, plus a splash of Scorpions thrown in.  But they are even better than that sounds.  By taking the cool parts of industrial music and mixing in the cool parts of metal music they have created a unique and individual sound.  This is similar to the way a band such as Led Zeppelin took various elements (blues and folk music in their case) and combined them into something new. I can also say that this is my favorite new band in the past ten years, and this is their best CD.  I am very critical of bands, and have been accused of not liking new bands because I am &quot;old&quot;.  Not true.  I don't like most new bands because they are either Alice in Chains or Iron Maiden clones. However this band rules and this is their best.  Buy it!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is, by leaps and bounds, the most innovative and talented band on the planet. They leap from music style to music style with the greatest of ease. They make albums that don't have one or two good songs. Their's are meticulous opuses with every sond different, distinctive, and joyously addictive. Amnesiac is no exception to this rule.     It has that elusive beauty in the form of &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, haunting melody with &quot;Knives Out,&quot; delectable experimentation with &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and burning soul in the melancholy jazz of the album's closing track, &quot;Life in a Glass House.&quot;     Behind most of the track's is the desperate hymn of the enigmatic man who has sung &quot;immerse your soul in love,&quot; &quot;we hope that you choke&quot; and &quot;I'm not here- this isn't happening.&quot; Now he tells us &quot;I'm a reasonable man- get off my case.&quot;
B000002N2N|5.0|Hearing this with your eyes closed, is like to be there in the show. There's something more fantastic than this. For all the people that(like me) never had an opportunit to go on one show of the Ramones, this cd help us to immagine this wonderful situation ! So what you're waiting to buy this ?!!
B00004SCX6|1.0|Now I have no problem with Britney Spears as a person at all. But let's face facts, she cant sing. This CD was awful. I think the only reason I bought it was because I gave into the Britney hype. All the tracks sound alike. The only reason shes singing is because she has the look. Everyone loves the little blonde belching out sweet melodies about heartache and love. But did they ever actually stop and listen to her sing? Take my advice, if your a person who does stuff just to be with the &quot;in&quot; crowd, go ahead and get this CD. But if you have any sense, go get Aaliyah's new CD, or if you like the blonde teeny bopper idol, get Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson.
068817776X|5.0|I am amazed that so many of my friends have never heard of this book.  It was an easy read, and I did not want to put it down.  Edith Hahn's story needed to be told, on behalf of all of those who survived as she did, outside the concentration camps.  She was a woman of strength with the will to survive against all odds.  Many books I give away or sell once I have finished them, but this book will remain on my own bookshelf to be read again!
0140434135|4.0|Although this was not my favorite of the Jane Austen books, such an observation can hardly be interpreted as a criticism. I mean, there simply are not enough superlatives to describe her books.  As far as Northanger Abbey is concerned, I was particularly struck by the exuberance of the heroine. When her imagination runs away with her in the wake of her reading of The Mysteries of Udolpho I was completely charmed. Austen captured the imaginative spirit of young womanhood in this book in ways that are quite timeless.
B000046RUU|5.0|[...], it's not often I award an album five stars but 'Moon Pics' is truly deserving.  Haunting, neurotic and beautiful all at once.  A must buy for anyone who loves real, honest, raw music.
B00005ASOC|4.0|As usual, Sean never fails to surprise me. Although I thought the young man should have been better at acting, but the film is very nice.
B000002GJ7|5.0|Extreme is truly the quintessential 80s rock band... composing ballads (like &quot;more than words&quot;) metal, early rap (&quot;when i'm president&quot;) and classic rock trends into a composite sound that twists and writhes as it struggles and ultimately succeeds in evoking a signature sound which is to this day, echoed, but never duplicated. Interesting how the formative sounds of the 80s metal scene carried into the early 90s so cleanly.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|If you like Musicals, you will love this movie. It has love and a lot of sense of humor.<br />You'll either love this movie or hate.
0451169514|5.0|There are so many Stephen King books, but this is one that gives new meaning to the word \\"horror.\\" IT tells the tale of a supernatural entity that is preying on the people especially the children of a fictional town in Maine called Derry. Seven kids, who become friends and eventually form a club (The Losers Club), encounter the evil force and do battle with it. But this is nothing like they have ever encountered. IT can take any form it wants, IT knows their darkest secrets, IT knows what scares them and IT knows how to manipulate them so it can do what it does best - KILL. The seven heroic kids do succeed in abolishing the evil, but 30 years later, IT returns. So now, these seven adults must keep the promise they made as kids - that if the evil ever returned, they would all come back and kill IT. The character of Pennywise the Dancing Clown has to be one of the most terrifying beings ever created for a novel. It will definitely make you think twice before going back to the circus. Stephen King does an excellent job of shifting seamlessly between the experiences of the main characters when they are kids and when they are adults. It is all very realistic too in terms of the experiences all kids deal with such as unruly adults, the neighborhood bully, falling in love for the first time, and dealing with your worst fears. The book may be 1100 pages, but you will read them very very fast. The suspense and terror never let up and each encounter with the evil being is more and more unsettling. Do not read the book alone and make sure the room is well lit.
0312932081|5.0|There are a lot of books floating through my house because both my mother and I are avid readers.  I found &quot;Ender's Game&quot; sitting on the table, picked it up and started to read.  For the next two days that book didnt leave my side.  I literally could not put it down because it was written so well.  Not many books have this effect with me.  The book was writen so well that every page hold suspense, even the last.  I have just started the second book in the series and its just as good as the first.  I recomend it to anybody that can read.
B000050IE6|5.0|I LOVE serenity painted death, it is one of my favorite song on this album, if you love fast metal, and acoustics , I incourage you to buy this album, don't miss out! It's great!
B00003003S|5.0|HANDS DOWN THEY ARE THE BEST, BUT THIS CD IS JUST COMPLETELY AWSOME FOR A HARD CORE GNR FAN!!
0316776963|5.0|Anyone who enjoys one hearty belly laugh after another will absolutely love this book!  I read it on an airplane and laughed out loud so many times, it was distracting to other passengers!  David Sadaris' untamed, sardonic wit brings an indescribable sense of humor to stories of his childhood, family, sexuality and travels.  What a talent this man possesses for storytelling!  A great gift for anyone who feels their life is hum-drum, and a book one could read over and over, and never get tired of!
6305013578|1.0|The film itself doesn't get one star. I'd give it five stars. Unfortunately, you can't give it a breakdown. Five stars film, four stars for music, etc... anyway...<br />I think this film is fantastic. Every serious fan of the medium should watch this work. However, this dvd transfer is very disappointing. I'm not going to go on at length about it because I've read some very creative and, sadly, accurate descriptions of what it looks like. While this DVD is a bargain, it is not worthy of the film. Don't buy it and wait for a nicer version to come along. Now, I know the film is over 80 years old, so I'm not expecting crystal clear quality, but they could do a better job.
B00005JA2B|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewers. This remastered CD is astounding in its clarity.<br />In my review of Masque, I revealed I'm a prog-rock nut; love the stuff. And this is a perfect example of why that type of music appeals to me so much.<br />Interestingly, as I was listening to Masque at the office with my headphones on (which, if you read my other reviews, is where and how I tend to do most of my listening), a co-worker stopped by to drop off a project. I asked him (a fellow music freak) what he thought of Kansas. He said &quot;I really liked in them in my day.&quot; He also said he understands why I like them: they blend the elements of progressive rock I like with good, old-fashioned Midwest rock.<br />His comments were ironic because when I got back from lunch with the remastered Leftoverture firmly in hand, I started reading the liner notes...and was blown away by the first few lines: &quot;The trouble with most art rock could be two-fold -- the art and the rock. As a rule, the art rock as pioneered by some of the British progressive practioners of the Seventies onwards was arty enough, but the rock part often left a lot to be desired. Kansas, on the other hand, rocked.&quot;<br />Bingo. That's why I like Kansas so much. They plumb the depths of all the classical, mythological territory explored by their &quot;art-rock&quot; contemporaries, but they add their own unique guitar-driven sound to the mix. Livgren and Williams are two excellent guitarists, each playing off the strengths of the other and creating some of rock's most memorable riffs.<br />Leftoverture, Kansas' fourth album, is astounding in its musicianship, vision and lyrical depth. If you read Kerry Livgren's biography (the now-out-of-print &quot;Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren&quot;) you'll gain valuable insights into why Leftoverture sounds the way it does lyrically. Songs like &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; are rife with Christian import and imagery.<br />Livgren's book is essential reading if you also want to know why Kansas sounds the way it does musically. His chapter on creativity and craftmanship in music is brilliant and reveals why so much of today's music sounds the way it does.<br />Musically, Leftoverture is wall-to-wall brilliance. Each track is a study in how music ought to sound and be played, from the opening &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; to the poignant &quot;The Wall&quot; to the closing, aptly titled &quot;Magnum Opus.&quot; Craftsmanship, indeed.<br />I'm listening to &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot; right now and am totally blown away by the mastering on this CD. Each instrument pops out distinctively and without apology. The bass is crisp and bouncy. The drums are deep and driving. The keyboards and violins are incredibly bright, and there are parts of this song I swear I've never heard before with previous masterings (such as a crystal-clear acoustic guitar that rings out beside the other instruments).<br />I haven't said anything yet about Steve Walsh's vocals, but that's a mixed blessing to me. On this album he's probably at his peak of perfection. What a voice! By way of contrast, his voice today is such a pale imitation that I'm truly saddened. He's still an amazing performer, but he's not what he used to be vocally. So if you're a fan of soaring, crystal-clear rock voices (a la Steve Perry or Dennis DeYoung), this is an album you'll want to own. Just be aware when you buy Kansas CDs of today, or see them live (yes, they're still touring!) that you won't be hearing the same Steve Walsh.<br />That said, I must say Kansas is one of America's truly great rock bands -- art or otherwise. They combined elements of art rock with solid guitar-driven rock...and managed to create a unique sound all their own that still sounds good some 25 years after it was first recorded.<br />Leftoverture, in this remastered format, is absolutely essential for all fans of extraordinary music.
B00000K31Q|5.0|10 Things I Hate About You is a modern re-make of Shakespear's THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. Kat Stratford(Julia Stiles) is that kind of a person who doesn't care what people think of her. Which makes her unpopular and not-wanted! Her popular, pretty and wanted sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik)is a happy cheerful sophmore who has every guy liking her. Their annoying and over-protective father (played by the histerical Larry Miller) does not allow Bianca to &quot;get jiggy with some boy&quot; unless Kat starts dating. And Bianca's French tutor asks her out and he finds out that she can't date unless her boy-hating sister does. So what Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Lewwit)does is he hires a guy with his friend Micheal (David Krumholtz) to take out Kat. They hire a bad-boy and a criminal of Padua High Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to ask Kat out. But Patrick starts to get to know Kat and finds her a normal girl! Bianca's boyfriend Joey (Andrew Keegan) is a very big-headed model who thinks Binaca likes him! This knee-slapping, side-aching comedy hit will keep you in laughs for about an hour and a half. Find out what happens when the Padua Prom comes about. Who's going with who? And whats the big surprise awaiting Kat?
B000002OQT|5.0|Somewhere in Time is one of my favorite movies...and not necessarily because I think the acting is all that great, either.<br />The setting (Mackinac Island, Michigan) is one of the most romantic and fun places on earth. And the story (by the legendary sci-fi fantasy author Richard Matheson) is clever and creative.<br />I think the music makes the movie unforgettable to me.<br />I have never heard such a marriage of music and story. This soundtrack transcends the movie and stands on its own as being some of the most heart-wrenching, emotional sounds I've ever heard.<br />Since there's no way to adequately describe the personal impact music makes on onself to another person (I liken it to describing the color green to somehow who's been blind from birth), I won't go into great detail in this review.<br />All I can tell you is that this music tugs at my heartstrings, soothes my soul and brings out my melancholy side like nothing I've ever heard. John Barry created a masterpiece with this soundtrack and I'll be forever grateful.<br />For romantic evenings, this soundtrack can't be beat. For getting misty-eyed over lost loves, you won't find better accompaniment. For sheer creative brilliance, this CDs takes the blue ribbon.<br />I highly recommend this soundtrack, especially in the gold disc, remastered version. Of course, if you've seen the movie you probably already own this disc. But, as I wrote, this CD stands on its own as beautiful music worthy to be heard. Buy it, play it and let it wash over you in waves of emotion.
0380973650|3.0|Gaiman is a great ideas man, which is why he has elevated comic book writing to great heights. However, his ideas often fall underdeveloped when they make it into book form. American Gods is no exception. Essentially the book is a few good ideas that were overextended without the follow-up or characters to fill a 400 page novel. Worth reading, but not up to the potential Gaiman has to offer.
B000001FVL|5.0|Believe it or not, I only just recently purchased The Age of Plastic to explore Geoff Downes roots.  This album represents a fine example of progressive pop.  Upon listening to it and being familiar with Asia's latest release (Aura), I can say that Geoff has returned to his roots.  In other words, his playing style on Aura is very similar to this album --not that Aura sounds anything like The Buggles. (PLUG:  Do not hesitate!  Grab Aura now!!  It is, perhaps, Asia's best album to date!)<br /><br />Though The Buggles had a style all their own, you can definitely hear some influences.  One that I seem to hear is early Simple Minds.  A couple of tracks have moments that remind me of Real To Real Cacophony --except less cacophonous.  Thus, Geoff's and Trevor's influences were probably bands like Roxy Music and David Bowie.<br /><br />The Age of Plastic is much more than an average pop album.  There are moments in songs like Living In The Plastic Age, I Love You (Miss Robot), Astroboy (And The Proles On Parade), and Johnny On The Monorail that are amazing!  Nothing self indulgent or pretentious, but some really good musicianship. Upon listening to this album, it is easy to see why Chris Squire chose these two guys to sub for Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman on Yes' Drama album; which is also a brilliant piece of work --highly recommended!<br /><br />Whatever the reason you are currently reading the reviews for Geoff's and Trevor's debut recording, grab this album if you do not already own it.  Even the weaker tracks such as Kid Dynamo and Clean, Clean have their moments.  So, whether you are an Asia fan, digging for 80's (actually late 70's) pop, or just trying to find something \\"new\\" to hear, buy The Age of Plastic today!  It is an adventure in modern recording (pun intended)!
0312979479|5.0|10 murderers... 1 deserted island... 1 killer amongst them.... NO hercule poirot, just perfect murders...<br />You'll love this book. You can't help to suspect everyone and as usual it's the one you least suspect. Get this book -- you'll be glad you did. It's short, fasinating and every page ends with a totally differnt mystery...
0060392886|5.0|Well, I'm pretty sure it's not gonna win any literary awards, but this book certainly was entertaining. It's a dark story at times, but after reading this all my problems seemed petty. Excellent, entertaining, (quick) read.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I saw Akira when I was in 6th grade and while a bit confusing, it blew me away with the quality and caliber of the animation.  &quot;You mean cartoons AREN'T always for children?&quot;<br />I've seen a couple comments saying Akira is overrated.  I'm an Anime fan myself and have to heartily disagree.  You don't say, &quot;Casablanca was good for it's time&quot;.  Or, &quot;Seven Samurai was ok, but there are much better films out there&quot;.  You give the film the respect it deserves.  It was groundbreaking and continues in a lot of ways to be the standard bearer of Japanese Animation.  It is a classic.  It is untouchable.  Simply nothing more, nothing less.
0812550757|1.0|As lackluster and uninvolving as any fifties B-movie, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is yet another testament to Card's impotence as a writer.  As always in his fiction, this book is tedious, flat, emotionally barren, and ultimately uninteresting.  I was so bored reading this that I eventually gave up on it, tossing it aside with less than thirty pages to go (though I did satisfy what little curiosity I had by reading why the piggies killed Pipo and Libo, which was a very poor payoff).  The characters are completely unlikable, and quite underdeveloped.  Ender should have monumental inner turmoil, but Card never gives it much thought.  Novinha is a cold, abrasive woman who's abusive to her children and never really understands the pain she causes with her secrets and actions.  And we're supposed to root for her.  Worse yet, the emotional factor is nonexistent.  Card tries to pull at your heartstrings, but it never works, especially in Ender's final farewell to Valentine, which should be tearful but is just as tedious and boring as the rest of this garbage.  If you're an avid sci-fi fan, you should go instead with the complex, utterly involving works of Philip K. Dick, or the thrilling, intriguing and detailed fiction of Michael Crichton.  Trust me, Orson Scott Card is no writer.  You'll find more exciting storytelling in any dime novel at your local Walgreens.  Avoid.
0684833395|5.0|A classic mixture of hilarity and horror.  If u liked Slaughterhouse 5, read this book.
B00003CY5K|4.0|Reese Witherspoon proves herself a talented actress in what could be a sequel to Clueless.  The film is satirical and bubbly with stereotypes about West meeting East (Coasts, that is).  While the movie is a silly and enjoyable film for young adults, it does have more than just pretty people and slightly unrealistic situations.  The great messages the film manages to get across for young women are very important.  <br />1. You shouldn't give up on something because other people tell you you can't do it.  <br />2. What you think you want is not always what's best for you.<br />3. If you promise to keep a secret, you should keep it.<br />4. If you believe in yourself then anything is possible.<br />Aside from the &quot;feel-good&quot; messages, the film is just a lot of fun.  You'll find yourself laughing out loud no matter your age.  This is a movie you should be happy for your kids to see.  This is also a wonderful film for mothers to enjoy with their daughters.  There is no sex, no drugs, and no violence.  It's great that such a positive film has made it to number one.
6304708521|2.0|Speaking as a true Beatle fan who, in my younger days, had a tough time acknowledging that everything the Beatles ever did wasn't perfect, I have to say this is one of the most painful things I've ever seen. But to its credit, you can't NOT watch it once it's on. You're just taken aback by how disjointed and bizarre it is. <br />Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.<br />But did you ever think that the best performance of a song in a Beatles film would be performed by the Bonzo Dog Band? (Interesting that Bonzo Neil Innes would later play Ron Nasty in the Rutles, isn't it?)<br />If you must have this, have somebody buy it for you...
B00005BJPO|4.0|Akira is probably the best anime I've ever seen. I love it. I went out and bought the Special Edition DVD the day it came out. The tin case is really nice looking BUT when you are removing the discs be careful. The little plastic hubs holding in the discs have no give at all. I thought I was going to split the discs but thankfully I didn't. The special features on the second disc are good. But don't plan on keeping the discs in the tin case, make sure you have an extra keep case that holds two DVD's. You think for what they charge for this it would come with a decent case! To sum up my review: Great movie but the case is crap.
0792156684|4.0|i personally like the movie, the special effect and the human drama made for a powerful combination when watching it in the theater.  i saw it twice in theater and eventually bought the dvd. if you dont know the story by now you should...  however on the off chance that you havent seen it, i recommend the vhs because the dvd has hardly any special features.  just a few trailers. especially considering how much media coverage the film got when it first came out.  if they had put a few more special features than it would be 5 stars
9700512479|5.0|Este es el Cien Anos de Soledad de Paulo Coelho.
0790729725|4.0|Goodfellas is one of the best mafia movies of all time. The directing is excellent and every actor was perfect for his/her role. The only thing that stopped me from givin me this 5 stars is that you have to turn the dvd over halfway through the movie. I heard that they are workin on a special edition. So if you already have it for VHS dont bother getting it for DVD. But if you dont have it for VHS (i didnt) and really badly get it!
B000002U8G|5.0|What can you say about this album? Well first off I agree with most reviewers who say that this is not the place to start with for Floyd. First time Floyd listener's go buy: THE WALL, OR DARKSIDE, then come and get MEDDLE. This is one of the best Floyd albums, it's hard to chose a favorite, but if I had to this would probably be tied for frist. <br />I have listened to this during 2001's Jupiter and Beyond the infinite. UNREAL! take two or three tabs and those 23 minutes of Echo will seem like four hours.<br />Every song on the disc is good, even the weird 'Seamus' outside...that's the dog..<br />If you are a Pink Floyd fan you must own this album.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album is fantastic. I wish I could wake up every morning to this album. Limp bizkit has always had great energy music. This one is no exception. They always explode into a great hardcore beat, and I love it. But, if I hear Fred say &quot;Bring it on&quot; one more time I'll spit. Sometimes the lyrics are amazing and I can really feel them, other times they are laughably bad. but they still rule, if you like rock, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000002U82|5.0|What can you say about the best piece of music ever made. The most soild album ever made. Front to back. From the first haunting voice saying, &quot;I've been mad for years.&quot; To the last murmurs of a faint heartbeat. So soild, this album will be rediscovered till the end of time, and beyond.<br />It's about the decent into madness, but it also has everything to do with life.<br />Breathe, Time, Money, Brain Damage, Classic Floyd! This is the one album to take if you where stranded on a deserted island.<br />'Eclipse' has probably the best lyrics of all time. Lyrics that anyone who is in love with rock and roll can relate to.
1859849296|5.0|&quot;The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice,&quot; by Christopher Hitchens, is one of the most audacious books I have ever read. The book is a merciless of expose of Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who has been internationally hailed for her work with the poor. But Hitchens claims that there is a dark side to this seemingly saintly figure, whom he calls &quot;a religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer and an accomplice of worldly powers.&quot; With his grimly intelligent prose, Hitchens does a good job of supporting this assessment.<br />Hitchens looks at Teresa's involvement with such unsavory figures as the corrupt Duvalier regime of Haiti. He analyzes the international &quot;cult&quot; of Teresa, and considers the political alliances she formed. He also takes a critical look at the hospices operated by her order, noting that the &quot;point&quot; of these institutions &quot;is not the honest relief of suffering but the promulgation of a cult based on death and suffering and subjection.&quot; Hitchens also considers Teresa's role as an international tool of the Roman Catholic hierarchy.<br />Perhaps the most damning section of the book is the sordid tale of Teresa's involvement with Charles Keating, who was convicted in the Savings and Loan scandal of the 1990s. This part of the book includes a photocopy of a remarkable letter signed by Teresa on behalf of Keating.<br />Hitchens' remarkable book reminds us that no public figure should be considered so &quot;saintly&quot; as to be above scrutiny. He also reminds us that it is often useful to analyze the political and ideological motives behind certain &quot;charitable&quot; enterprises. &quot;The Missionary Position&quot; is a well-written and thought-provoking analysis of the shadowy intersections of politics, religious dogma, and popular culture.
B000002C1V|4.0|The first time you hear this your like what? But once you listen to all of Floyd's works, and Roger's solo efforts, after all that you can learn to appreciate this album. It was the last Floyd album with Roger at the helm. It is very poetic, and often rocks!  Favorite tunes off this one: Hero's Return, Possible Pasts, The final cut, Two suns in the sunset,
B00003CXS4|4.0|This is a very uniquely made movie.  While is does contain some violence and many may be put off by the language (very rough), but if you can enjoy or see past the rough language and just appreciate the film, you will emjoy it. This is one on the best low budget films I have enjoyed in a ong time.  It is also especially enjoyed by someone who has spent some time in the UK.
B00005BJPO|5.0|The guys who did this transfer did it lovingly, and with great attention to detail. I have this movie on a Criterion Laserdisk, and after watching this transfer, I had to wonder if my glasses were always dirty when watching the laserdisk. Just simply a perfect, crips, detailed picture. I was seeing thing in the film I had never noticed before.<br />The 5.1 soundtrack remix was also done extremely well.  Even the menus have 5.1 soundtracks.  The New English Translation is first rate and much better than the old one. <br />If you have any love for this film, get this disk!
0316286443|1.0|This was such a dissapointing book full of flashy photos and Kevyn's sometimes silly anecdotes. Yes, there are instructions for creating all of the looks - but is this realistic?  Really come now, are any of us going to try to make ourselves over into Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, James Dean, Clark Gable???????  This is just another vehicle for the author to showcase his magic on the human face (he is an extremely talented artist in his field) however, he is not giving us anything new since his last book and frankly, some of the contents of this book are rather bizaar.  If you like to look at beautiful photos of models and celebs buy a magazine, study the makeup and try it out. It's alot cheaper than this book.
6303407188|5.0|What are they waiting for? This is probably one of the best films Tim Burton has directed, and one of the best roles ever played by both Johnny Depp (as Ed Wood) and Martin Landau (as Bela Lugosi). I don't want to keep buying VHS tapes that deteriorate on me over time.  My last copy just konked out on me. Get this on DVD, PLEASE!!
0553106635|5.0|Gripping fast paced storylines that take hold and wont let go.  George Martin has let his imagination run-away in an orderly and fascinating fashion.  I hope with all sincerity that his story, imagination, and committment to the task have the staying power necessary to take me to the last page with the same intensity.
0553293397|5.0|The unique thing about this book is that, beside evrything that has been said about this book (robot psychology, tight thriller etc.), I found it to be a beautiful love story, in a very differnt emotional set up, with the least physical interaction between the protagonists. Asimov's insight into human character is brilliant and this understanding is best brought out in his extrapolation of human reactions in situations so difficult to envisage by our perceptions, modelled by our social and emotional environment. if you have any interest in reading books, don't miss this one, and the Foundation trilogy (I won't put the late sequels and prequels in the same category).
B00005KFUM|1.0|Muse have never been ''on the scene''. And in my opinion they never will be. This album it's not a hit,it's a disgrace. Even the title Origin of Symetry, it sounds like an Italian opera not an album (if you even class it as a piece of music). I can't stand the voice of Mr.Belamey. The high pitched cry. If you can spend 12.99 on this, you might as well buy P.Daddy's rubbish too.<br />One star for the cover, that's it.<br />Oh! and answer me two things 1. Why does Matt Belamey try to immitate Thom Yorke and fail miserably 2. Can you without looking at the lyrics understand anything he says. Didn't think so.
0807014265|5.0|Where did I come from?  Why am I here?  Where am I going?  These are questions that confront humankind each day.  Without the answers to these questions, a person may find their life void of purpose or joy.  This book does not answer any of those questions, but reminds you of the importance of getting the answer to the second and third questions.<br />Before reading the book I felt I had a pretty good grasp on my own answers for the three questions of life.  However, Dr. Frankl made me specify my answers.  I needed a mission, a creed by which I should live my life, a statment by which I could measure each decision in life.<br />Dr. Frankl explains, through his own experience during the Holocaust, that each person has a reason to live.  When that reason ceases to exist, that person must either find another reason or be dead emotionally.  This story reminds me of the story of Anne Frank.  She was doing quite well until she felt that her entire family was dead.  She could no longer see a reason to continue fighting the opposition, so she gave up and died shortly after her sister.  Had she known or thought her father was still alive, I believe she may have been able to escape sickness and survive her imprisonment.<br />Dr. Frankl encourages you, without preaching, to find THAT reason for you life.  What purpose does your life hold?  Don't ask what you want out of life, but ask, &quot;What does life want from me?&quot;  The key is to find what life wants from you.<br />The holocaust stories will help you see the necessity of answering these questions.  Whether you find your life with or without purpose, read this book.  It could change your life for the better.
B000002AE3|4.0|I always look forward to a new Toto album because I know it's going to be good. Tambu is no exception. With Steve Lukather still doing most of the lead vocals, there are some real gems here that belong on anyone's Toto &quot;best of&quot; collection. &quot;Gift of Faith&quot; sets the tone for the entire album and &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, &quot;Time Is the Enemy&quot;, and &quot;The Road Goes On&quot; are all incredible. &quot;The Turning Point&quot; and &quot;I Will Remember&quot; are good as well. This is a can't miss.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a ten-year-old album. We live in a different world. Is it even relevant anymore?<br />Only if you have a sense of history and an appreciation of what U2 did back then. The world's biggest rock band of the day shrugged off all expectations and began a four-disc (including Passenger One) exploration of what was then the approaching frontier of rock -- that is, the open interfacing of electronica, dance beats and guitar-driven sounds. Territory previously explored by Lou Reed, Talking Heads, David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Brian Eno -- and subsequently elaborated on by Chemical Brothers, Moby, Fatboy Slim, Radiohead and many others -- and gratuitously ripped off today by the music factories that produce boy bands, Britney and Cher -- saw the light of truly massive popular exposure, arguably for the first time, with &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. <br />U2 took a rare leap for a band at the peak of all powers, confronting the advent of grunge by leaping past it into an ignored (at that time) but ultimately more innovative, compelling and enduring place. That the exploration is often viewed in retrospect by many classic (i.e. &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;) U2 fans as a dark age is irrelevant. If what you value in music is not the commodity but the exploration, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; represents a powerful statement in advocacy of change for the sake of art in the face of commercialism.
B0000026CM|4.0|Original Toto lead singer Bobby Kimball was with the band for their first four albums. With the release of &quot;Isolation&quot;, the fifth album, Fergie Fredrickson was brought on board, but did not stay for another album. With the sixth release, &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;, the band recruited Joseph Williams to take over. He would return for this album, &quot;The Seventh One&quot;, and then he too would depart. Lead guitarist Steve Lukather would take most of the vocals for the next two albums. Bobby Kimball has since made a triumphant return on the superb &quot;Mindfields&quot;.<br />Having said all that, it should be noted that while Williams was with the group the band would have a sound that would be different from anything they had done before....or since. This album, along with &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; are very top 40 popish sounding but in a good Toto way. If it were anyone else, I would probably trash the CD's, but these guys have enough talent to switch gears and pull off songs and sounds that others could not. &quot;Pamela&quot;, &quot;These Chains&quot;, &quot;Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Mushanga&quot;, and &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; are all solid. The band would make a radical turn with their next album, &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; (arguably their best and heaviest) but this album has a more relaxed sound. Perhaps kudos should go to Joseph Williams himself (wherever he is).
B00004Z459|4.0|If I wasn't so sick of hearing the song One Step Closer.  Don't get me wrong its a good song but they play it SO MUCH on the radio!  Anyhow, I really do like Linkin Park.  Its interesting that they have two vocalists; their voices create kinda a layered sound that keeps things interesting, with one singing and one rapping.  And they pull of lots of tight instrumentation without a bassist which is pretty unusual.  Their songs have a good beat and are catchy.  The lyrics are really thoughtful and they show both loud sides and a softer side, such as In The End, personally one of my favourite songs here.  Cure for the Itch is fun, DJ solo which is a nice break.  I'm looking forward to more CD's from Linkin Park!
B000059WH0|5.0|Although not well-known and not a big seller, this album may be the band's best and is maybe my own personal favorite. When I first heard &quot;Gypsy Train&quot; I thought that this was another band calling themselves Toto. It's that much different sounding from anything they had ever done. &quot;Don't Chain My Heart&quot;, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot; &quot;Kick Down the Walls&quot; and the title song are all grade A material. Don't hesitate to get this album. You won't be sorry.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Since getting this cd, it has spent a lot of time in my cd player. It cooks from start to finish, not a weak track in the bunch...and that's impressive. Tony Martin is truly a gifted frontman even if he does slide into Dio territory at times, that's fine...he has the chops to get away with it. The band delivers in spades with lots of energy. Check out the late Cozy Powell on drums, rock solid. Sound quality is typical Sabbath- loud and angry but quite clean. Clocking in at 40.37, the only thing I could have wanted is a few more tracks. Headless Cross is the one to own, TYR and Forbidden just don't come close in terms of raw power.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is one of my favorite Beatle albums. Brilliant, filled with inovative songs that would still be ahead of their time if they were released today.  Eleanor Rigby is poetic and filled with haunting imagery. Here there and everywhere is the most underated love song ever written. Beautiful and hearfelt. . Got to get you into my life with trumpets and horns blaring behind a great rock rhythm obviously influenced the group Chicago. The Beatles always had a knack for perfection and even their lesser songs would be classics themselves. All their music is love at first site. Once you hear a song it sticks with you forever, and revolver is no exception.
B00000768B|2.0|Madonna and Britney Spears had great first albums. However, this isn't one of them. While I enjoy ABBA's later albums, this one never quite rises above silly with a bunch of fillers. One example is &quot;Me and Bobby and Bobby's Brither.&quot; Gosh, it's annoying now!!! I used to like it. After ABBA evolved into more mature artists (by next years 'Waterloo,' they were already MUCH better) they are more enjoyable. Far more than this ... piece of immature ....
0385484518|5.0|I picked up the book in a store by intuition, as I sometimes do that. Then I started reading it and continued until finished. One of the best books I have ever read, with lots of brilliant words and ideas (that we think we know, but often forget) to help us go through life and experience it at its best, a book for us - people who live, not just exist.
B000002C4O|3.0|This album contains duets with Lucianno Pavorattie and Barbara Streisand - I dislike both of them. I just don't like them. But this album has it's good traks. And they are 'Treat Her Like a Lady,' 'My Heart Will Go On,' (from Titanic) and 'Let's Talk About Love.' A romantic CD, flawed, but nice to own.
1878424319|5.0|This book is helping to change my life!  Following the easy agreements will help anyone achieve personal freedom!
B000002LND|5.0|This collection is Madonna's hits from the 1980s. From &quot;Holiday&quot; to &quot;Vogue&quot; it has it all. During these years, Madonna changed a lot. She still does. From street girl-boy toy to voguer, she did it all. This collection starts with 1983's &quot;Holiday.&quot; &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; (both also from her debut) are also included. Of those two, &quot;Borderline's&quot; my favorite. It defined the early-'80s Madonna. If you want to check out Madonna, please, start out here!
0679777547|3.0|After seeing the mess of a movie called &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, I thought perhaps the book might be better.  In many cases, a fine novel is turned into a poor movie.  In this case, a mediocre book was turned into a horrible movie.<br />The book had all the ingredients of a thriller, satanic cults, mysterious deaths, etc.  The characters were appealing, such as the main character Lucas Corso.  But it never fully jelled together.  Some major gaps remained unexplained and the ending was not dramatic enough to have sustained the previous pages.  I would not call reading this book a waste of time as it can be read fairly quickly but I would not recommend it highly.
B00000I950|4.0|This is certainly a good ABBA album. However, new fans should not start here. Their 'Gold Greatest Hits' album is more winning. This album does contain some of ABBA's tracks, as follows:<br />&quot;Voulez Vous&quot; &quot;Angeleyes&quot; &quot;Chiquitita&quot; &quot;If It Wasn't For the Nights&quot;<br />But it also has &quot;Kisses of Fire&quot; and &quot;Lovers Live a Little Longer&quot; which are both sort of flimsy and outdated. The rest of this fine album is better. However, get the essential 'Gold' CD and you will not be dissapointed. But this one's still a winner.
B00000255F|5.0|This album proved that Bruce Springsteen ranks alongside Bob Dylan as the two greatest rock poets of all time. Born to Run was a stroke of genius. It combined the masterful music of the E Street Band with the poetry of the Boss himself like no one else could. You will no you're holding a product of genius upon listening to Thunder Road for here it is Bruce who is &quot;singing for the lonely&quot; (hey thats me) The trend of mixing rock and poetry continues Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, Night, and Backstreet. Then comes the title track that scratched the Boss's name in rock and roll history. This song merges a fast beat with lyrics so amazing it is undescribable. She's The One and Meeting Across The River are fine songs though don't represent the best of the album. The album then ends with a brilliant rock 'n' roll opus in Jungleland. Springsteen's Born to Run is simple, no strings attached rock 'n' roll (no trace of heavy metal, no experimenting, just great rock 'n' roll) with not so simple lyrics. This is essential to any fan of rock 'n' roll. Stop reading and buy!
B000056HOZ|5.0|Anything Bruce Springsteen produces is great but I agree there could have been more &quot;extras&quot; on the DVD including history and interviews. There are many more songs that I would like to see live especially from his latest E Street Band tour ( which unfortunately didn't come to Australia). What are the Bonus Songs that are supposed to be included on the DVD? Am I missing something other than the ones listed on the cover?
B000001E18|4.0|There seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding this album; I view it as U2's second best album, behind The Joshua Tree. It's experimental, to be sure; a lot of what you hear will surprise you if you are new to U2, having only heard their sugar-coated singles to their latest, sugar-coated, corporate-radio friendly album All That You Can't Leave Behind (Beautiful Day, Elevation, etc..) If you don't like your music spoon-fed to you like the above songs, you owe it to yourself to try Zooropa; sometimes dark, sometimes brooding, but always interesting. In fact, I think that U2 has their second best song ever on this album; Dirty Day, (next to the unassailable Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) which is horribly underrated, much like R.E.M.'s Falls to Climb. The First Time is excellent also, as is Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car. If you've been burned by U2's latest, vacuous album, give this one a shot; it's their last album to date that showed any real substance.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|AKIRA Limited Special Edition, the ground-breaking film that put anime on the map, makes its long-awaited debut on DVD in a superior two disc set that includes a cleaned-up widescreen transfer with a new English dub in sterling 5.1 AC-3 Dolby Digital Surround.  A unique feature allows for English translation of most of the Japanese graffiti seen in the movie. A second disc features a detailed production report, sound clips, an interview with writer, designer, director Katsuhiro Otomo and more.  Ten years after its original release, \\"Akira\\" is still an eye-filling, visceral, tour de force plunge into a 21st century apocalyptic world of psychic forces (akira) and demonic entities.  And of course the inexperienced biker Tetsuo who is at the center of the vortex.  This is a cult film of disturbing power that some fans call prophetic.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Being a fan of all types of animation, and having read that this was supposed to be a masterpiece, I decided to give it a chance.  It turned out to be one of my all time favorites.  Everything in this movie is done well.  The story is great, and the music is beautiful (Kudos to the composer).  I have showed this to several friends (most that don't like animation) and all of them have loved it.  I cannot say enough good about this film.  The movie is presented so well that you forget it is animated.  I encourage you to buy this film, but if you don't want to spend the money, at least rent it, you will be surprised by how good of a movie it actually is when you see it for yourself.
B00003CXS4|3.0|Guy Ritchie's follow-up to the hugely entertaining gangster caper &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; does not break new ground.<br />This impressively packaged two disc release includes a great-looking widescreen transfer of the complex and violent gem heist that's peopled with a bunch of heavy-accented oddballs including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones.  Brad Pitt is a bare-knuckle Gypsy boxing champ who apparently speaks a hybrid Welsh-English, but in a funny and completely indecipherable dialect.<br />In fact, the entire film needs the optional English subtitles, but I think that's intentional.  The point of the movie is that it's all about the comic-book images and the sounds -- not words.  Disc 1 includes full frame and widescreen versions with a funny director and producer commentary.  Disc 2 includes a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, storyboards, photos, trailers and web links.<br />It all adds up to way too much info for a less than significant film.
B000002HH2|5.0|More than one critic has contended that with her sophomore solo album, \\"Post\\", Björk had written the seminal album of the decade. Whether or not this claim is correct, \\"Post\\" is without question the best album for anyone unfamiliar with Björk's compositions or performance style. <br /> \\"Post\\" is Björk's most stylistically electic album, meshing more developed versions of her earlier endeavors with inchoate musical ideas that would later flourish in \\"Homogenic\\" and \\"Vespertine\\". Two songs (\\"Army of Me\\" and \\"Enjoy\\") take her punk background and elevate it miles above the amateurishness of Kukl. Two more (\\"The Modern Things\\" and \\"I Miss You\\") echo the electronic pop of \\"Debut\\" with considerably more sophistication. There are remnants of the late, \\"Stick Around for Joy\\"-era Sugarcubes in \\"Isobel\\". There's even a throwback to \\"Gling-Gló\\" in her manic cover of Betty Hutton's \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\". <br /> Along with these refined versions of Björk's earlier theories, \\"Post\\" also contains the first seeds of the two themes that have become her trademarks and have resulted in her best work. The first of these is the fusion of electronica and classical into a unique and exquisite style; in \\"Hyperballad\\", the best piece of the \\"Post\\" era, Björk wraps her voice around mellifluous strings and computerized beats, prefiguring many of the pieces in \\"Homogenic\\" and even \\"Selmasongs\\". The second is the thrill of quiet; \\"Possibly Maybe\\", \\"Cover Me\\" and \\"Headphones\\" all show the composer's first solo experimentation with musical privacy, a theme that forms the crux of \\"Vespertine\\". <br /> \\"Post\\" is not the best album of the 1990s; it isn't even the best Björk album of the 1990s. It is, however, a marvelous, unparalleled achievement in so many different fields of composition that the album is ideal as an introduction to the Icelander's multitude of styles. Whether you go from here to the rock and roll of \\"Miranda\\", the experimental punk of \\"The Eye\\" and \\"Holidays in Europe\\", the insane pop of \\"Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week!\\", the jazz of \\"Gling-Gló\\", the electronica pop of \\"Debut\\", the 21st-century classical of \\"Homogenic\\", the melodrama of \\"Selmasongs\\" or the placidity of \\"Vespertine\\", \\"Post\\" is the place to start.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Filmed not too far from here in the town of Baghdad in the Mojave Desert, Percy Adlon's BAGHDAD CAFE has charmed just about everyone who has stumbled across this literally off-the-beaten track 1987 gem that's now available for the first time in a bare-bones widescreen DVD transfer.<br />The story is deceptively simple. Marianne S&auml;gebrecht is a German tourist who leaves -- and is subsequently abandoned by -- her husband(?) in the California desert.  In the middle of nowhere, she makes her way to the run-down, failing, Baghadad Cafe and Motel run by C.C.H. Pounder (ER's Dr. Hicks).  The rotund S&auml;gebrecht quickly becomes a part of the eccentric family under Pounders tough-talking rule. Not only that, her presence is the catalyst that transforms the forgotten roadside stop into a bustling business and a life-altering experience for all present.  Jack Palance is extraordinary as an ex-Hollywood set designer and artist who sees S&auml;gebrecht's true beauty and becomes obsessed about capturing it on canvas.  What he sees S&auml;gebrecht becomes and in the process impacts those she touches.  This wonderful film is about loving and accepting and believing and discovering and being.  The original music by Bob Telson includes the haunting &quot;Calling You&quot; sung by Javetta Steele.  This is one for the digital library.  Highest recommendation.
0316776963|1.0|This book has been described as acerbic, witty, and funny. I beg to differ. While parts of the book certainly live up to this billing, almost every anecdote is marred by something jarringly crude or gross. Perhaps is helps make the point? But it really ruined the book for me. For example the image of a nude man being painfully stomped by a woman(?) in spike heals is about as funny as school shootings or people being dragged to death.
0375703861|5.0|Great characters and wonderful prose make it a must read.
B00004S96B|4.0|This was nowhere near 'Mindcrime' but who could follow up that album? In its own right, 'Empire' is a solid album indeed! &quot;Best I Can&quot; and of course &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; are awesome! &quot;Another Rainy Night&quot; is also extremely catchy and radio friendly while keeping metal integrity. &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; was hugely popular and probably the closest Queensryche ever got to breaking into the mainstream. A must for your collection!
0440219078|4.0|My family is working our way through Newbery books, as our bedtime read aloud novels.  I read this book before reading it to my children and was glad that I did.  I felt that the subject matter was too sophisticated and intense (a la Brave New World) for my kids -- all under 9.  This book deals with euthanasia and infanticide for the sake of Sameness in a controlled community.  We're not ready to tackle those mature topics.  I did, however, enjoy the book myself.
B000000ORE|5.0|As soon as I heard the ferocity of &quot;Hang Tough&quot; I knew Tesla was still the hard rock behemoth 'Mechanical Resonance' proved them to be. &quot;Heaven's Trail&quot;, &quot;Lady Luck&quot; &amp; &quot;Makin' Magic&quot; are huge, powerful rock gems. And of course, &quot;Love Song&quot; was so damn catchy and well written, I know nobody could get that &quot;Love will find a way&quot; line out of their head until Nirvana hit with &quot;Teen Spirit&quot;. Great album! The way music should be!
B000005JAX|5.0|First off, let me warn you, you'll be dissappointed unless you're a Die Hard DM fan. The synths are skeletal, only providing the most stripped down framework for a song. The instrumentation is minimalistic so that the vocals will stand out. Nevertheless, the album is incredible. Like everyone else has been saying, the album is intensely emotional. That's definitely it's most notable characteristic. Also, Martin's voice rings like it has never before on any DM album of the past. His voice is just so strikingly moving here. <br />Now for the bit that you haven't heard before... tracks 2-4 are very melancholy and dark, much like the true gems of Depeche, and are my favorites. Track 5, &quot;Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth&quot; has a lighter, fuller sound with acoustic guitar backing the vocals and has a very mezmerizing quality the way Martin layers his vocals.<br />While it's true Compulsion is the only DM-ish sounding song, it's really quite boring. It sounds really flat and is not the least bit engaging, emotionally. The lyrics are sung all at one tempo and Martin monotonously rushes over them kind of uneventfully. <br />Finally, Track 6, Motherless Child, is so beautiful. It's dark and desperate. The first minute of the song is comprised of a drawn out intro (using a string section, etc) that paints a beatutiful soundscape as the basis of the song. There is only a single stanza, 4 lines, to the song. Martin uses this track to demonstrate his vocal talent as he drifts across multiple octaves. It's stunning. <br />I love the lyrics of all the songs. All are as soulful and just as enigmatic as DM's best. A true gem for the open mind.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Let me start of by saying that Tesla just flat out kicks...[butt]! This is the disc that let everyone know Tesla was for real. Jeff Keith's voice is one of the most dynamic and recognizable voice to date. All the way from \\"EZ Come EZ Go\\" to \\"Cumin' Atcha Live\\" & \\"Gettin' Better\\" Tesla shows their down home denim, boot wearing rock godliness! I still bow down to this day to \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" and the sheer power of that track! Good God, Tesla rocks!
0812550757|1.0|The character Ender has grown some 20 years while the universe around him has aged 3,000 years since he fought in the Bugger War. What I loved about the first book is the strong connection of love between Ender and Valentine, which had moved me to tears. However in the second installment, this bond between brother and sister is ripped apart when Ender again decides to travel, leaving his sister behind. I couldn't stand to read the book any longer, and put it away. That bond that I looked forward to reading about was ripped apart, and I couldn't continue. It is a lousy book, which i do not recommend.
B000002UE9|4.0|This disc is alot better than &quot;Cat Dragged In&quot; probably because Poison had matured a little bit and wiped off some of the makeup (not all of it). &quot;Nothin' But a Good Time&quot; was catchy and popular and you can't deny that. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is also a well written track. &quot;Every Rose&quot;, of course, needs no description being one of the most popular ballads of the 20th century. Just don't take Poison too seriously and you won't be disappointed.
6304044836|5.0|I have to say that I was very surprised at how good this remake of Sabrina was.  I went and saw it at the theater, and bought a copy of it when it came out the first time.  I still have it and it's about worn out I watch it so much.  The actors that they got to play the originals were amazing (Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford, and Greg Kinnear).  I've never seen a remake that had such good actors.  Where they film the movie is beautiful (especially Paris), it's clean, and it makes you feel good.  There aren't many movies around these days that do that.  It's a movie that you can watch with your family.  It is definitely a change from the normally macho Harrison Ford, but it shows the softer side of him and how versitile he is as an actor.  I definitely encourage anyone who has never watched this movie to rent it or buy it, I guarantee that you will enjoy it.
B000002UEB|5.0|What can you say about a landmark album like &quot;Mindcrime&quot;? Anyone in the metal community knows that &quot;Mindcrime&quot; is one of the most captivating and best concept albums of all time! Hearing this album is like a mind-trip without the chemicals. Everytime I listen to it, I always listen to the entire thing because each song is just so hypnotic and draws you further into the album. Definately the height of Queensryche's career and probably one of the most influential albums of the 20th century for metal music!
B00005B4GU|5.0|The band has left certain audience-pleasing activities traced on the nontheless excellent album OK Computer (and more so on the previous two), resulting in an interesting quest heard on Kid A and this. Experimentalism or not, this is a band that wants to get on. It's their finest hour. So far.
B00000I07Q|5.0|I have to be honest, at first I didn't think Bon Jovi could follow up their debut success with an even BETTER album, but they proved me wrong. It's obvious that the band spent a lot of time thinking about the new material that would later end up on their best album to date. The first single off the record, &quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot;, (my favorite on the album) is the best arena rock song I've ever heard. It sounds like Queen was the main influence on this particular song. The second song on the album, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; is pure '80s &quot;hairband rock&quot;. In other words, it's just downright FUN. Another highlight on &quot;New Jersey&quot; is &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;, the only real ballad on the album. It gets better every time you listen to it. &quot;New Jersey&quot; is definately a keeper.
B00005LB50|5.0|&quot;Box Set,&quot; the retrospective four CD career retrospective of the Buffalo Springfield, has been rumored, announced and expected for so many years that it began to appear that it would never be released.  Apparently a lack of interest from members Neil Young and Steve Stills delayed the project for over a decade.  In recent years, though, Young came to view this turbulent period of his life with more appreciation than unhappiness.  It was apparently through Young's recent efforts that &quot;Box Set&quot; finally emerged, and what we have is a thorough, perhaps, even exhaustive look at an important and influential rock &amp; roll band.<br />  Buffalo Springfield was a &quot;can't miss&quot; band that, sadly, just missed.  Formed early in 1966, the five-man group featured three powerful singer/songwriters in Young, Stills and Richie Furay, all veterans of the '60's folk music scene who found more distinctive styles when they turned to rock.  The Los Angeles-based band lasted just two years. They had a hit single (the magnificent &quot;For What Its Worth&quot;) almost immediately, but the trouble began very quickly. Internal dissension, drug busts, poor management and a botched mix of their first album crippled the young band.  By the second album the group was already fragmenting, with the three songwriters recording often recording their own tracks independently from the rest of the band.  A third album was pieced together from leftovers and outtakes after the members had already gone their separate ways in May 1968.  Despite this rocky history, Buffalo Springfield was way ahead of its time, successfully integrating rock, folk and country influences with some of the best songwriting of the era.  They were among the most ambitious acts of their day, and when their efforts were successful, Buffalo Springfield were unbeatable.<br />  So how can a group that survived barely two years be considered a legend?  If the case can be made, the proof is in this set.  Included here are classic tracks from all three albums, in the best sound quality possible, plus rare outtakes, demos and non-album tracks.  The most memorable music here are those songs that have always been considered classics, including &quot;For What It's Worth,&quot; &quot;Mr. Soul,&quot; &quot;Bluebird,&quot; &quot;Broken Arrow,&quot; and &quot;A Child's Claim To Fame,&quot; are still powerful music.  If few of the other tracks reach those heights, it's because very little music does.  There are revealing versions of songs by Stills, Furay, and, most significantly, Young, that were not released by the Springfield but reappeared later in their writer's career. &quot;Box Set&quot; should also go far to restore the musical reputation of Richie Furay, a terrific singer and songwriter who was strongly influenced by country music and who went on to form the seminal country-rock band Poco after Springfield had split up.  Furay's excellent work here more than holds its own when compared to Stills and Young.<br />  Sadly, no live recordings are included in this set.  The band was at their best on stage, with Stills and Young already engaging in the monumental guitar duels that would be a major part of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young's performances a few years later.  Unauthorized live recordings have surfaced over the last three decades, and inclusion of some live cuts would have offered lasting testimony to their greatness as a live act.<br />  There are a few other things to quibble about, as there usually are with these multi-disc retrospectives.  There a lot of demos here, many of which are from Springfield's formative months.  While they give some insight into the creative process and how the group's sound developed, not all of these songs are memorable.  Also, the fourth disc offers only new remixes of the band's first two albums, a welcome and much-needed opportunity that the band did not have in 1966 and 1967.  The music sounds great, but many of the songs appearin their originally-released versions elsewhere in the box.  Perhaps this fourth disc should have been included as a &quot;freebie,&quot; which would have kept the price for the package at $40 or less.  Finally, the failure to include the rare nine-minute version of Stills' &quot;Bluebird&quot; (a guitar tour-de-force and a staple of FM radio when it appeared on a 1973 &quot;best of&quot;) is hard to understand.<br />  These concerns are minor, and &quot;Box Set&quot; is a fine and fitting tribute to Buffalo Springfield. The packaging is well-conceived, and the excellent booklet includes valuable essays and a slew of rarely-seen photographs.  Buying this set is a no-brainer for fans of the group and its members, but casual fans are also likely to greatly enjoy &quot;Box Set.&quot;in their originally-released versions elsewhere in the box.

B00004ZB9D|4.0|It is almost his best, and I say almost because there R two songs I think don't fit into this compilation: Mr. Cab Driver and Black Velveteen. Both of them R different from the other songs's leading style, the first is plain blues and the second is among Lennys weakest efforts IMO. Where the hell is Circus or I build this garden 4 us? Still a great, but not perfect compilation from one of the greatest one-man-bands of all time. Highly recommended 4 Kravitz fans and rock/funk/blues fans also.
B00005AAFS|4.0|This is theatre, through and through. Rammstein are nothing more than the dark humour of a darkly clad (and apparently darkly thinking) community: a chance for carefully painted Gothic visages around the world to crack half a smile.<br />Anybody who has witnessed Rammstein live will know that the band - plastic-penis props and pyrotechnics - like their theatrics to mix with the music. This is also clear on Mutter, their third studio album: here lies a rather disturbing rock opera.<br />Where Marilyn Manson might try admirably to be scary, Rammstein are more like genuinely scary guys trying to be funny. Through walls of industrial-influenced strings and the biggest chunker-chunker guitar riffs around, these East Germans are playing with perceptions.<br />The production on Mutter is absolutely amazing. Get some really good headphones (German make, of course), indulge in your poison and listen to this - loud. If Gladiator was epic and spectacular enough to win a gump like Russell Crowe an Academy Award, then Mutter definitely owes Rammstein a Grammy.<br />Taking full advantage of this massive sound, the band waste no time in setting about doing what they do best: creating melodrama. From the opening grandeur of &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot; - which sounds like Led Zeppelin's &quot;Kashmir&quot; after a strict diet of sausage, sauerkraut and steroids - Mutter is gloriously over the top. The singles &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot; and &quot;Sonne&quot; both pack harpoon-sized hooks and 10-tonne riffs, while &quot;Feuer Frei!&quot; spits its refrain with the attitude of a Hun charging into battle; you can hear the pleasure with which the band take on their warrior roles.<br />The title track builds from a delicate introduction, which vocalist Till Lindemann seems to communicate some very serious longing for his mother (not necessarily in an appropriate sense) before delivering an ear-splitting chorus that shows this is more than a kid calling for his mum...there are some serious psychological traumas in this character.<br />&quot;Spieluhr&quot; introduces the album's most interesting moment, with its spoken introduction as haunting as anything in The Exorcist; more eerie because you can't understand a word Lindemann is saying - like listening to a wizard conjuring demons, which arrive in the form of a massive Helmet-style guitar riff.<br />Sure, like all Gothic art, Mutter is too extravagant and unwieldy in places, but it's still a musical journey though one of the most bizarre fun houses around.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have been listening to Enya for quite some time now. I turned others onto her wave of flowing peace, relaxation and a wholeness of beauty she puts in her lyrics and music. Great to sleep to and definately meditate to if others are not disturbing me. Her music is hauntingly mysterious, lulling and serene to where you would just feel at peace and believe you're in another world that the music takes you there.
B0000025T6|5.0|By the end of 1981, Bruce Springsteen (along w/the E Street Band) had acheived the status that had been predicted for him.  Bruce and the band had toured the US and Europe over the past year, a tour that brought them into the arena-rock pantheon full-time.  As &quot;The River&quot; tour evolved, so did his musical vision.  As the tour closed, Bruce found himself ready to explore his next musical frontier.  So on January 3, 1982 he sat down with a 4-track tape deck and his guitar, and began strumming the chords and lyrics to what would become &quot;Born in the USA&quot;.  Out of this burst of inspiration, one that was brought on by a man in his early 30's wondering about his place in the community and how that world around him was changing, came this album.  Over the next few weeks, he laid down the bare, acoustic tracks of songs about the desolation and deparation of people grappling with a world and society being shifted under their feet.  Reagonomics was in full swing, and suddenly the value of an honest day's work and the life that followed was being ripped from under the communities of Freehold, NJ and Pittsburgh, PA and their ilk.  What came out of his take on this was a masterpiece.<br />On this album, Bruce alone, with his guitar and harmonica and little else in the way of instruments, created an aural landscape of life on the edge.  From the title track, a look into the mind of serial killer Charles Starkwether the tone is set. On &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, arguably the album's best track, Bruce explores the human cost of quick riches at the expense of what came before.  His Catholic upbringing shows through with the refrain &quot;everything dies, that's a fact; but maybe everything that dies, someday comes back&quot;; redemption and salvation in the face of adversity.  It is in such songs that a rich narrative and attention to detail make this album a sort of black &amp; white documantary of the rust-belt politics of the 70's and early 80's, and how America's heart was sold down the river by the same people sworn to uphold it's promise.  Other standout tracks, such as &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;, &quot;My Father's House&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot; and &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; tie the themes of family bonds and the struggles within those families.  On &quot;Used Cars&quot;, the narrator paints a poignant tale of pride in the face of hard times. The politics of a dying economy, brought on by an indifferent corporate America, spins the tale in &quot;Johnny 99&quot;.  And just to mix it up, &quot;Open All Night&quot; casts an edgy yet rocking tone to the album just by the way this tale of an ordinary guy's all night drive just to get to his girl and kick off the drudgery of his day recalls the epic storytelling of Chuck Berry some 25 years earlier.<br />Not long after Bruce laid down this demo, he went into the studio with the E Street Band and tried to record this with them in the vein of a true rock album.  Not happy with the results, he scrapped the idea and released the acoustic demo as the final product, a daring decision in itself.  At some point, he needs to release those sessions, for as we have seen on the 1999-2000 tour, some of these songs got better with the full band treatment.  It should also be noted that not long after this album was recorded, Bruce and the band began the 2 year, over 100-track odyssey that would result in the &quot;Born in the USA&quot; album; the rest as you know is history.  So in effect, &quot;Nebraska&quot; became the launching pad for a 2 year period of songwriting and recording that saw dramatic shifts and changes in musical styles.<br />If you are a true fan, as I have always been, this album is a must. Rich with classic imagery, borrowing from sources as diverse as the bible and Mafia gang wars, all painted in a stark and straighforward vision. A work whose impact only heightens with time.  If you don't own this, you really are missing some of Bruce's best work.
B00005LB50|3.0|Man, I love the Springfield.  I love the Springfield more than CSN&Y, more than Poco, more than Loggins & Messina, more than Stills solo, and yes, even more than Young solo.  They had a great sound, a sixties sound in the best sense of the term - great vocal and guitar arrangements, great rhythm section, great songwriting - they had it all...but not for long.  So, was I excited when I heard that a four disc, that's right, FOUR DISC, box set was in the offing?  You bet I was.  Was I even more excited when I heard that the masters of the remasters and reissues, the great Rhino Records, was the label releasing it? Yes, yes, yes!!<br />So why am I SO disappointed?  What could possibly be wrong with four discs of Buffalo Springfield?<br />Look closely, it's not really four discs of Springfield:<br />First of all, true fans of the Springfield, who are probably the only people who will buy this box set, already purchased the \\"deluxe\\" re-release of their first album in 1997.  Released at a price of almost [...] bucks, the price was justified, I guess, by the fact that it included both the mono and stereo version of the album.  Did that really justify the price?  No production costs, very little in the way of promotional costs (they know fans will buy it, and that's who they're marketing to), probably not all that much paid out in royalties...think about it.  It reeked of fan exploitation.<br />So then what happens?  The box comes out and, you guessed it, you get their 1st album in mono and stereo, AGAIN!  Of course, the stereo is piece-mealed over the first three discs, but the mono is there on disc 4...<br />...as is their classic, Again, in stereo which, you guessed it, also shows up, also in stereo, also in piece-mealed fashion, on the first three discs.  Yes, that's right.  On the same box, the same 12 songs are issued in the exact same versions twice!  This is sounding like the Department of Rundancy Department!<br />Oh, don't get me wrong, the 22 demos are cool.  They would have made great bonus tracks on a reasonably priced deluxe reissue of their three albums (are you listening, Rhino?).  But where are the live tracks?  Wasn't the Springfield the stuff of lengends on the stage?<br />I don't know, I just find this set very frustrating.  If you are going to give a four disc restrospective to a band that was together less than two years, wouldn't you assume that it was going to be painstakingly comprehensive?  This isn't.  It's missing tracks from their last album, and inconceivably does not include the stunning extended version of Bluebird that has never been issued on CD.  How could they have not included that?????<br />Finally, the price.  How dare they state that the fourth disc is a \\"bonus disc\\"?  At that price?<br />I've always championed Rhino Records, feeling that they were the undisputed kings of the reissue.  This release, as exciting as it was, is, ultimately, [taking advantage] of Buffalo Springfield's loyal fans.  They are, in essence, paying [...] bucks for 22 demos, 5 or 6 remixes, and a couple of \\"previously unreleased\\" tracks, as they will certainly have the three albums already, in sound quality not drastically different than what is heard here.  This looks like a coporate \\"Maximize Profit, Minimize Expense, Who Will Notice or Care\\" project.<br />We Notice, We Care.ey would have made great bonus tracks on a reasonably priced deluxe reissue of their three albums (are you listening, Rhino?).

B00003CXSP|5.0|Ten years ago the psycological thriller &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; took home the Award for Best Picture meaning this was the best movie of 1991. It was pretty boring. Now &quot;HANNIBAL&quot; come out and was totally different. A brilliant, slick masterpeice that was very much better than &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It is very different from every movie I've ever seen. If you are looking for a slasher film, watch legend John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot;.  If you want Silence, watch it. This is strange. It is romantic yet more slick, it is very, very twisted the way Dr. Lecter plays his deadly mind games, it is spooky, yet more mysterious. BUT I MUST WARN YOU. ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH AND HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE FOR BLOOD. Although it is not a horror or action film it is one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. The &quot;Dinner Scene&quot; made me very, very sick to my stomach. Much gorier than &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, much more interesting too.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|this is the best robin hood movie made yet.    see it...make your friends and family see it....this movie is a classic forever.....
B00005LMBK|5.0|This album is an example of the innovation that is taking place in music today. It may not sound familiar, but that is what makes it a great album. Incorporating sounds from several genres, this album is an example of how music is moving in a new direction. Forget for a moment the Limp Bizkits and Korns and get ready for something fresh. Most folks that don't like it complain that the sounds of 'Clint Eastwood' are not reproduced on the rest of the album. THIS IS A GOOD THING! If you want to hear something new and exciting pick this one up. If you want to hear the same thing 17 times listen to the radio.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Given enough time, all of those teen-aged Nu-Beatles fans sucked in by the ubiquity (and near-perfection, natch) of &quot;1&quot;, who move onto the other albums and learn the story of the Fabs will no-doubt come across this mysterious little piece of 60's pop legend. &quot;Hmm, it inspired Sgt. Pepper's? Hmm, it's Paul's favourite album of all time? Interesting, I may just purchase this curiousity.&quot;<br />And they'll discover that it's better than any album the Beatles ever made. <br />Oh, not that The Beach Boys are the superior band. Far from it. But unlike any of The Beatles' perfect albums (though Sgt. Pepper does try to fake it) there is a album-length concept or theme at work here. There is a bittersweet flow of emotional maturity and musical innovation as the yearing-for-maturity &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; slowly metamorphosises into the yearning-for-youth &quot;Caroline, No&quot;. <br />Side One is filled with subtly unconventional love songs like &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot; (an ode to a forgiving girlfriend), &quot;That's Not Me&quot; a story that's more or less become this University-student-to-be's theme song lately (&quot;I once had a dream/So I packed up and split for the city&quot;) and &quot;Don't Talk&quot;, which, in the spirit of the song, I won't try and describe.<br />The optimistic, tender first half of the record reaches a turning point with &quot;Sloop John B.&quot;, and the line 'I feel so broke/I want to go home'. Afterwards, the songs take on a --- while not dark (this is a Beach Boys album, come on...) --- less innocent tone. &quot;Here Today&quot; is a streak of romantic pessimism, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; mixes cynicism with hyperbolic boasts of love undying, and of course, &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; is the first and last statement in not fitting in. Sadly, that song would also serve as the unfortunate motto of this album and it's creator circa 1966. <br />Brian Wilson made this album to comfort his listeners --- when it bombed on the charts and he heard the arguably finer-produced &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; a year later, he broke down. Any fans of this fine album will find themselves wishing they could have comforted Brian during that time with the knowledge that NOTHING could have surpassed his creation. <br />Is the album weaker for lacking &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;? I doubt it. Unlike the greivous error of leaving &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; off of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot;, which weakened that album immeasurably, the omission of GV from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is more like the omission of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; from The White Album. Like that song, &quot;GV&quot; simply would have overpowered the rest of the tracks.<br />Not to slight The Beatles, for their mastery of all pop is unsurmountable and they are Gods unto all others, blah blah, but one guy with a broken heart and an uncanny ear managed to make an even better and more cohesive 60's record than they.<br />If you already own this album (as you should) and you're looking for something else that you might enjoy, I recommend two more recent albums: The Soft Bulletin by The Flaming Lips (for epic conceptual sweep and musical experimentation) and Pinkerton by Weezer (confessional lyricism and catchy pop hooks). <br />Woof, bark, woof.
B000002J20|4.0|Pun not intended, I say...er...&quot;Yes&quot;. After all, Oldfield didn't own the genre. In this album there's electric guitar, acoustic guitar, steel guitar, mellotron, mimimoog, Hammond organ, grand piano, Rickenbacker bass, early synth drums, regular drums...but...NO tubular bells. It would have been a lousy idea for Yes to totally switch to this format, but I'm glad they did it once. The opening movement (&quot;Revealing Science Of God&quot;) starts out very softly with just Anderson's vocals and Howe's volume-pedal guitar and builds from there. In contrast, the last movement (&quot;The Ritual&quot;) has a very clangy drum solo using some sort of cowbell and a Moog drum. One of the movements ended with Anderson backed by an acoustic guitar which might have been his own--he's no Howe but he's good enough for that part. You can't say these guys weren't big on dynamics. Meanwhile, all we heard from the (do I have to say it?) journalists of rock was how inconsistent Yes and other prog groups were with what rock'n'roll was supposed to represent. Years later in the liner notes to Yes' massive box set &quot;Yesyears&quot;, Howe commented that they had never set out to play rock'n'roll as such in the first place. I put down the booklet and bellowed; &quot;Why the hell didn't you say that 20 years ago?&quot; You know, I don't think he heard me.
B00004WG2X|5.0|About a year ago I wrote a review of the Colin Firth BBC version of Pride and Prejudice (about the 115th review, and as of this writing, there are 169 reviews of that version).  This version, unbeknownst to me then, was re-released at about the same time.  I said then (and still believe) that the Colin Firth version is very good (4 of 5 stars) but this is clearly the best.  The main reason: Elizabeth Garvie simply \\"IS\\" Elizabeth Bennet.  There could not be a better actress for the role.  Elizabeth Garvie may have the most expressive eyes that I have ever seen on the screen.  Further, this version is more faithful to the book.  In this version, I think Jane is substantially better cast and most of the rest of the cast are either as good, or marginally better than in the Colin Firth version.  (I think the two Lydia's are roughly equal, though completely different--but I get a kick out of Julie Sawalha's Lydia in the Colin Firth version since the character is almost the polar opposite to \\"Saffy\\" in Absolutely Fabulous, also played by Sawalha.)  The main exception as to the two casts is Colin Firth, who did a substantially better job as Darcy than David Rintoul.  Rintoul (as several other reviewers have agreed) was too stiff or wooden.  (However, the scene--and Rintoul's acting in it--where Darcy and Elizabeth meet by surprise at Pemberly is absolutely magical.)    I note that most of the other reviewers share in my enthusiasm for this version, and I agree generally with their comments.  One reviewer who was lukewarm about this version complained that it did not track the book accurately.  I haven't read the book 40 times (like one favorable reviewer), but I have read it several times, both before and after seeing both this version and the Colin Firth version, and this is far more faithful in my opinion. One viewer has lamented that there no other productions with Elizabeth Garvie--a lament I share.  I was told one time when I was in England that she retired from actingto raise a family, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this.  She did have a minor part recently in a new production of Jane Eyre, however.    My advice:  Pride and Prejudice with Elizabeth Garvie is the tops by a mile. The Colin Firth version is very good, and a must for real lovers of Jane Austin.  (I have it and I watch it occasioally.)  The pre-war Hollywood version with Laurence Olivier is a travesty!
B000051YEG|5.0|Many reviews tell you how cool this record is...And believe me, if you have any curiousity, this record's no waste of time. What alot of reviews haven't told you is what the album's about lyrically.<br />For those who don't speak french,the music's reason enough. The downside to that ofcourse, is that you miss out on the wicked wit of the lyrics. Gainsbourg didn't so much &quot;Have a way with words&quot; , He HAD HIS WAY WITH THEM. He was king of the double entendre and innuendo.<br />Basically the story is this, a  somewhat middle aged guy in Rolls Royce accidently knocks 15 year old Melody off her bikey. The old codger and the red-headed nymphette end up having a passionate affair coupled with a few ensueing entaglements due to their gap in age. In the end, little Melody dies in a plane wreck, leaving our man out in the cold.<br />Not the stuff of typical rock opera, but I'd say as far as &quot;concept&quot; albums go, this is one of the greatest next to SGT. Pepper's. It's sexy, twisted, eloquent, not to mention down right quirky. I couldn't give you a favorite song, they're all part of the whole mesmerizing cycle.
0790733226|5.0|Acting skills and screenplay quality aside (which were the best I've ever seen), this film had accomplished what very few others had not, which is to provide the viewers with ideas that would change their lives. Just think about how many brilliant school kids made up their mind to pursue (good) science, and for this matter, to help make Earth a better habitat after they were shown the splendid magic of Carl Sagan, Robert Zemekis, and many others committed to educate the mass. <br />Just consider the good this movie has done to our society(and what many others had done the exact opposite), _Contact_ is unambiguously the best film ever made by our species.
0671027344|4.0|Just when a book hits the stand with numerous reviews, many readers are born thereafter.  Mine was such an occurrence.  For some reason, some books are banned from U.S. public school reading lists every year.  This novel happened to be one of these.  I sought the book after reading the censorship article.  Then, I understood the need for books that speak to our time--without regard to convention--to begin the necessary revisionist tradition.<br />I read this book in one gulp.  Chbosky's voice enters Charlie's world with depth and clarity.  No one could have done this better than a gifted writer such as Chbosky who enters the halls of Charlie's mind and feelings.  The novel speaks to readers of all colors and ages.  This is a necessary coming-of-age novel, and I cannot compare it to any other young adult novel.  Indeed, there are many \\"perks of being a wallflower.\\"<br />....
B000001DTM|5.0|In my opinion, Achtung Baby is U2's best album to date, although it's really difficult to compare their 80's sound with their reinvented 90's groove. The album marks a radical reinvention of the band U2 and its sound, the likes of which I've never seen in any other band. Simply put, U2's massive reorientation cements them, in my mind, as one of the greatest rock bands ever. They succeeded magnificently in staying with the times where just about all other 80's bands fizzled and died when the new sounds of the 90's came 'round. <br />The album starts strong with &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and never looks back. In addition to their big hits &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; the album offers many lesser commercial hits that are nonetheless brilliant in &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,&quot; &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; &quot;Ultraviolet,&quot; and &quot;Love is Blindness.&quot; Simply put, there is not a bad song on the album - on the contrary, Achtung Baby offers 12 great songs which can be sampled one by one but or (preferably) as a whole. This album showcases Bono's superb lyric-writing ability along with Edge's innovative and highly diverse mixture of guitar riffs, Adam's ultra cool base lines, and Larry's steadying drum beats. <br />Achtung Baby is a departure from U2's more politicized songs of the 80's, exploring the dark sides of love, desire, commitment, and temptation. Yet, despite the change in subject matter, U2 proves that their new song topics are no less poignant, and indeed are perhaps more univerally themed than anything they've ever written. The result is a brilliant album - it has my highest recommendation.
6305841861|5.0|Ok, I think the Amazon reivew got it a little wrong.  the special effects are not mind blowing, at least not by today's standards.  This movie is excellent, in the same way that all cult films are excellent.  this film knows where its at, and it is proud of being a silly horror movie.  Also, I don't think that any of teh characters in the film are &quot;teens&quot; as the Amazon review states (Ash would not get carded, especially not with that chainsaw on his arm).  Anyways, this DVD makes the package all the better, cuz you get the director and actor's commentary (on the same track) and you get the making of video.  Very fun, slightly creepy.
B00004Z459|3.0|Coming to light toward what seems to be the end of rap/metal's reign on popular music, Linkin Park have little at first to distinguish them from the rest of the crowd. There are the usual heavy guitar riffs, scratched and sampled background sounds, and combination of rapping, singing, and screaming. What does set LP apart from the rest of their rap/metal peers, though, is this last bit. First, there was the brilliant decision to include two vocalists, one to rap and one to sing, rather than have one who can rap decently but whose singing voice sounds like a geriatric toad with pneumonia. On top of that, there is the fact that one of these vocalists, Chester Bennington, has a powerful and emotional singing voice which is mostly used for, surprisingly, singing (as opposed to the mindless screaming favored by Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit). This is when Linkin Park sound their best - when everything is focused on Bennington's singing. The only problem is that there is not enough of this. Out of twelve tracks on the album, only three of them really emphasize it. Most of the songs instead center around Mike Shinoda's rapping, and the first single, &quot;One Step Closer,&quot; actually does go mostly for the creaming thing. <br />The instrumental end of the band is fairly standard. Most of the songs begin with a sad, almost painful guitar riff or synth loop, and then drop it in favor of the usual crunchy guitars and crashing drums. When they want to, though, Linkin Park have the ability to show some originality. The various depressed intro loops, if isolated, show enough creativity to eventually evolve into their own potentially powerful songs. Also, through all the generic modern metal trademarks, there are occasional flairs of wit, as in the Spanish-sounding guitar riff that opens &quot;A Place for My Head.&quot; All in all, there's not much here worth noting, but it's obvious that there could be if that was what the band was aiming for. <br />Recommendations for the nextalbum (I know it might sound pretentious of me to be saying this, but what's the point of criticism if it isn't constructive?): Less rapping, less screaming, lots more real singing. As I said above, that's what Bennington's voice was made for; the gift should definitely be taken advantage of on more than a quarter of the album. Also, shy away from the generic rap/metal instrumental sounds, and harvest that creativity that's trying to poke through. Linkin Park has the potential to take modern mainstream metal to much greater heights than those at which it currently resides. That's not something which should be wasted.
6305313687|5.0|I am not an emotional person, but this movie got to me. I didn't cry or nothing of that sort. But I did feel emotion after watching the film. It makes you think. Anyhow I dont get emotional over any movie due to the simple fact movies are just movies and I cant compare them to reality. On the other hand when it comes to this moive I cant really say that. This film is extremely realistic and it makes you think about the society we live in today and how messed up it is, but on the side to that the film teaches a very valuable lesson. I would say this is a must see film. I have rented it at least 15 times I dont see why I just dont buy the film. I have had all of my friends watch the film. Not really a big big movie fan, but this moive would have to be in my top 5 without a doubt. Buy the film.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I have to admit it, despite my best efforts. Scary Movie is a hilarious film. Well maybe not hilarious, but very very funny. The first time I was it I couldn't stop laughing, funny joke after funny joke. I mean it was so shocking and over the limit, yet incredibly funny that I couldn't stop laughing. The main problem with \\"Scary Movie\\" is simply that the second time you watch it, it isn't that funny. Alot of shock value comedy just becomes disgusting.  Overall it is a good, very funny movie, but a) it's only funny if you see Scream, Scream 2, and I Know What You Did Last Summer first and b)after the first veiwing many jokes get old and just plain disgusting. Still a great comedy though.
0060194995|4.0|I cannot deny that this novel pulled me into the story and maintained my interest.  The novel, chock full of human insight, doesn't opt for lies or platitudes.  But some schools teach this work as a profound statement on race in the USA.  While this may be true, the father's representation of a falsely accused black man despite threats from the white community, while admirable, isn't the key.  The key to understanding race in the USA lies in the fact that the author does not imagine in detail the lives of that black man and his family, the real tragedy, the real and profundly distrubing story that this book only mentions in passing.  The child narrator loves her father for his principles, but does not begin the fathom the situation of the black man's family.  By all means read this book, because it shows that even many decent and well meaning whites do not really understand the lives of American blacks.  And read it with a reading group and ponder whether this was the author's intention, or a limitation of her own understanding merely reflected in the book.
0226264017|5.0|Amazingly easy to read yet he puts forth profoundly important ideas. He does not need the security blanket of copious footnotes. What a concept. Those few reviewers that have trouble with its readability must be terrified by the power of its ideas and do not know where to turn. This book provides an understanding of mankind's true nature and how the private sector performs better than government functions. Even if you are a modern day left winger, you need to read this book because the people's ideas are increasing drawn from Milton Friedman's views. This book is full of ideas that are so compelling despite being minority views that they will not go away. Forty years later his ideas still are discussed as remedies needed for the future of the world not just the USA. The most powerful and easy to understand is free trade. How anyone can be intelligent enough to be elected to congress and not understand the power of free trade is very mystifying. Yet about half of them seem clueless of the mathematics.<br />As you can see from some reviews , Friedman's ability to use simple little examples to clarify issues is so effective that it gets some reviewers angry. The examples are nonetheless liberating to the mind that hesitates to think more deeply. His clarity is the reason for the power of his ideas through the decades. Realistically, this book can be recommended to anyone that is searching how to write on complex subjects and yet be understood.<br />He is accurately critical of the Federal Reserve. If written today he may say that the Federal Reserve did a very bad job in the last 10 years, It was not true that all we had was inflation of 2 to 3 percent per year and that is nothing to worry about. This excess money supply was sucked up into a stock market that is still overpriced. Reading this book may help you understand this viewpoint. More importantly, if you take a measure of the few ideas that have been accepted from Friedman versus the many that have not I can nothelp but wonder if another forty years from now Friedman will be seen as even wiser than he is currently. Freedom is not easy to hold unto and that was the greatest concern of the nations founders. If you share this fear even today then you will readily see how Friedman has such great appeal to those that love freedom and are willing to pay a short-term price to build on our freedoms.<br />Despite the age of this book their is little that is out of date. While the USA educational system has this great fear of teaching economics in the high school, the fact remains if you do not understand economics you do not understand America. Read this book and you will understand why economics belongs in the high schools. In the forty years of studying the markets, I remain in awe of how the best answers come from free markets. Every time the government steps in saying yes but in this case the market is wrong, it ends up the government was really wrong. Many times I thought the market mechanism was wrong, but I was wrong. If you read this book you could save a lot of time on your experience curve.<br />Today, capital moves around the world at lightening speed if your country does not provide the rule of law and free markets your prospects for attracting capital and retaining it are greatly diminished. If the country is not a democracy the stability of its laws is doubtful because the government's stability is suspect. This makes capitalism or free markets, the most likely path to freedom and the most likely protector of freedom. As democracy has become so widespread, each country provides an environment that is attractive to stock market investors or the money quickly goes elsewhere. Increasingly, governments must respond to subtle difference in the investment climate because there are so many attractive countries to consider. Free markets can not be turned back without experiencing withering capital flight. Capital is no longer the prisoner of governments, citizens are far less mobile than capital. Throughout modern history government is constantly trying to expand its power at the expense of the individual, capital is increasing the ally of individual freedoms and democracy. Doing business with a powerful undemocratic government has become to risky with so many democratic nations to chose from. In the long run big government is in deep trouble. If you do not understand market forces you will not understand the future. This book is easy to read written by one of the all time great thinkers on the subject.
0060931736|5.0|I'm sorry, I'm such a fan of this book I refuse to engage in detailed analysis.  Read this book, slowly, outloud for the utter wit of the writing.  No pack of one liners, this book is perfectly plotted and characters well developed.  Then read this book again for the many very serious ideas it explores.  I first read this novel for a philosophy course. A choice by no means eccentric.  Spark has been compared to Jane Austen for her wit and social observation, but not because Spark imitates Austen.  Spark is Jane Austen's mordently satirical, and far less kind daughter who's outgrown her provincial mom's world.
0804106304|5.0|Back in Freshman year there was a short story in my 9th grade English anthology by Amy Tan. It was called The Rules of the Game. It was a great story to break into high school with because I really enjoyed it. Now I've finally had the chance to read where the story came from and I was defiantly entertained. The Joy luck club is a beautiful book with one theme, the relationship between mothers and daughters and the joys and strengths that they share. The narration's jumps between four mothers and their daughters. Real life in China and modern day life in the US. Each story has it's own plot and resolution. Weather it's a young girl in China forced to marry in an arranged marriage when she was only 12. Or a young wanna be prodigy trying to live up to her mothers expectations. There are stories about going through a divorce, living with a concubine for a mother, dealing with your mothers death, or finding secret strengths inside of yourself you never know existed.<br />I was very impressed with this book. My favorite stories being Waverly's and June's. Every page is entertaining and it's actually even taught me a little about Chinese culture. Everyone who's a mother or a daughter should defiantly read this book. I'm defiantly going to pick up another book by Amy Tan. The Hundred Secret Senses is on my shelf waiting to be read.

B00004XONN|5.0|This album is groundbreaking.  This album is a rebellion to the anticreativity movement in the musicworld today.  This album expresses feelings in a way unlike any other.  With amazingly jagged lyrics and revolutionary sound Kid A shows why radiohead is renowned as one of the most talented bands in the world.  Yorke's voice resonates throughout your car/room/head with tones so deep and obviously heartfelt that it is not even necessary for the listener to understand the words in order to comprehend the message he's conveying.  A message of the state of the world we live in.  The irony of Everything in its Right Place and Optimistic, the feeling that everybody's had at least once in their life that comes through in How to Disappear Completely.  The sonic beauty of the album holds the interest of whoever's listening, an interest that can span many times through because of the completely new sound radiohead took on with this album.  thank you for reading this.
630018403X|5.0|the breakfast club, now 15 or so years later is undoubtably a true classic, and is often quickly recognized as an absolute force of nostalgia that emanates from the depicted era but also one that trancends all barriers, distinctions and emotions. such conclusions seem to even be immediately agreed upon by recent first time viewers who are helping define it's timelessness. TBC is special and 95 percent of the perople that have seen it seem to agree. it is an indisputable gem. the consequential debate lies not in whether this is a great movie but rather in how real it is or even what about it is relatable to reality and what is just wonderfully executed fantasy. i will set the record straight by saying TBC does not even come close to mirroring reality in any of the intricacies of its its plot or it's characters. it's great storytelling ::: a great senario that would never actually play out the way that it was portrayed on screen. but that's what movies are all about ::: unattainable bliss. what is real about TBC is its resonating nostalgia and surging emotion ::: the triumph and the memories. this is what everyone relates to, not the inconcievable storyline that cant' help over-riffing on fantasy, happy endings and a perfect destiny. TBC is a fairytail, it just happens to be really good one that will last forever.
0780622553|2.0|I purchased this film solely on the reviews and without previewing. Though I am a huge fan of the genre, it is extremely rare when it is well done. This was indeed a sophmoric work, a grand idea but without a budget and substandard writing (Sam Raimi???)it is difficult to pull off. It seems that Blade Runner, with about the same two or three soundstages, created a world far more unique and captivating. This story had a great influence on the Matrix, but it developed unnaturally fast even to be comic book plausable. It was sloppy, choppy and without depth. Finally, when the true nature of the &quot;Dark City&quot; is revealed, it reminded me of some bad anime, full of techinical imagery, but without any true vision. <br />In short, its drive-in fare
B00003CXSP|2.0|Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is a good movie. The follow-up to the critically successful \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" is a meager attempt at best. I guess the problem stems from the fact that the novel was not that good. \\"Shock value\\" and \\"tasteless\\" are a few words that come to mind. In a movie with such great talent and a pretty good director, you would hope that the movie would succeed where the novel failed, but that was not the case. <br />What intrigued me about the first film was the everlooming presence of Anthony Hopkins. Behind the glass cage, you sensed the danger in his character. In this film, he's all over the place. Now, he's just an old guy that's walking across the street. They tried humanizing him, trying to give him more emotions to work with, which was a mistake, since at face value, Anthony Hopkins looks like one of your dad's older friends - harmless - instead of the psychopathic killer we'd expect from him. His presence is gone. Now we know why he's a psychopathic killer; ...  <br />Honestly, the only thing that kept me awake in the film are the over the top gross out scenes we'd expect from a bad \\"Nightmare on Elm St.\\" film. If this film didn't receive the NC-17 rating for violence, I don't know what will. <br />Still, Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance. That's about it.
0452282152|3.0|I came onto Amazon.com and read the reviews for Girl With A Pearl Earring before going out and buying it.  The majority of the readers gave the novel a strong rating and the reviews led me to expect and outstanding novel.  However, I found quite the opposite.  The novel was bland and the characters flat.  Griet's whining was annoying and Chevalier's portrayl of Vermeer was a sorry one.  I grew to hate both these characters.  Chevalier began too many things and finished them either too abruptly or with too little thought.  That's the overall view of the novel I got.  I feel the author didn't put enough time into the novel.  It had great potential but the novel failed to come close to my expectations.  Expect easy reading but not much else.
B00003CXE7|1.0|This movie was better when it was called &quot;Ben Hur.&quot; And I hated &quot;Ben Hur.&quot; The effects here were so overdone, the computer-generated scenery so artificial, I felt ill. Computer imagery ought to be used only when necessary, and with a budget like this clunkers,' real scenery would have been easy. The acting was fair, I'll admit, but the script so trite and forced one wonders why the actors even bother. Oh, yeah....money. This movie is all hype. bleckt
0684171600|5.0|This book is a CLASSIC! Unforgettitable characters like Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesy, Or Tom Redruth entwined in plots and scenarios with the opposite type of people like Billy Bones, Ben Gunn or Abrahm Gray. Don't get yhis book wrong though it's not \\" a torcher\\" or boring. They don't ride a boat and find treasure, They Have to gallantly fight against traitors Long John Silver, Isreal Hands and try not to be surprised when Long John's parrot Captain Flint swoops in on you. There's fighting, decept, affection, and adventure, all rolling in to a happy ending. Other great reads may be The Three Musketeers series, The Count of Monte` Cristo, both by Alexandre` Dumas, and The Reddwall series by Brian Jaques.
078322737X|1.0|'American Graffiti' is easily George Lucas' best film.  Not because of poor direction verging on the sloppy, killing any momentum with inept editing and boring compositions.  Not because of a leaden script with no sense of structure, that prevents some decent actors from even thinking about characterisation, and which places the burden of period atmosphere and emotional resonance on the soundtrack.  Not because of Lucas' usual preference for machines over people, or his misguided assumption that a string of tedious anecdotes makes a compelling, 'real' and nationally symbolic story.  No.  'American Graffiti' is George Lucas' best film because it is 11 minutes shorter than 'Star Wars'.
B00000K458|5.0|With so many great albums, it's hard to say which one is Hawkwind's best.  If it all came down to it, my vote would probably go to Mountain Grill.  Well, for best studio album, anyway.  With Psychedelic Warlords, D-Rider, Lost Johnny, Paradox...how can you go wrong?  Hard to come by, but incredibly rewarding.
B0000508U6|5.0|Thanks to this album, I made it thru a heavy, cold day..warm and sure, messages of love, thought inspiring and gracious...you will, I'm sure, ENJOY!
B0000070SN|5.0|I had to travel to England to buy this, but it was oh, so worth it.  Why bands like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones are remembered and Hawkwind is virtually unknown is beyond me (nothing against the two former groups, but Hawkwind is equally deserving).  Space Ritual is an all-time classic (and it's got great packaging, too!).<br />Heavy, man.
0440211727|4.0|This is a book that if you can read it in more than one sitting I am shocked at you.  This is a great Grisham book.  Being his first I expected it not to be that good. But it seems from the being Grisham wanted to show the world who is king.  It is about a girl who gets assaulted by some white folks and during their trial the father decides to ... them.  Now it is a battle to determine if it was a legal move to do.  They pleed insanity.  And on top of all this the KKK is there. This book is everything that Grisham is I recommend it to anyone.
B000002HPV|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Bjork, but I decided to pick this up after reading some things about it's connection with the creations of Kid A and Amnesiac by Radiohead. Anyways, I must say that this is a great album. And really, I must say that my favorite track is probably Pluto. It seems like everyone who's reviewed this album as said that Pluto is annoying, but it's an awesome song. You have the abrasive sounds starting the song, and then as the song builds you see the beautiful melodies behind the noise, or at least I do. I just love that song, and if it was up to me, I would've released it as the single!!!! But really, everything else is good. The mix of strings with electronica is pretty amazing. Joga is an awesome song as well, but like I said, they're all good. Definately pick this up if you like techno, or even if you're just a fan of Radioheads newer releases. I'm definately gonna expand my Bjork collection after listening to this one!!
B00005BCPC|2.0|Laden with too many agendas, this film misrepresents the understated feminism of Austen (which was actually bold for her time).  To the film's credit, Nivola is the quintessential Henry Crawford, a man who takes a huge gamble on love, only to gain with his vanity that prize which his true heart despises.  O'Connor is a luminous find, yet poorly directed here, and often sprouting dialogue completely foreign ...as depicted  by Austen in the novel.
0688152023|5.0|The exercises in this book are easy to follow, and result in stronger longer well proportioned muscles.  Most of us use our major muscle groups only, while the exercises in this book are  designed for the forgotten muscles.  I don't think the first half of the book is necessary--I thought it was worthless.  However, the workout itself I think is great, and I have given the book to a few friends. The bottom line is that I highly recommend the book for the excellent exercises.

B00004XQP4|5.0|I used to listen to bands like Rancid and I'm a long-time Green Day fan.  I never bought Nimrod, but I liked the song &quot;Warning&quot; so much that I decided to buy the album and see what Green Day was up to these days.  I love the new sound on this album.  Yes, it is more mellow than their earlier stuff, but I think it's great that the band has evolved.  GD has matured and mellowed (like me!).  <br />Oddly enough, I find some of the songs to be reminiscent of the Beatles.  I'm going out to buy Nimrod, because I'm curious to hear the transition between Insomniac and Warning.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed proved that their debut album wasn't a fluke as they rocked through all 11 tracks of Human Clay. I agree with [...] who said that people who diss Creed because of their lyrics should grow up. You've got great taste if you get this album. Rock on, Creed!!!!!
0061002860|4.0|This book is my first Agatha Christie novel, and I must say that it lives fully up to its expectations. Christie weaves a beatiful tale of a murder that can keep anyone guessing. In fact the book had a lasting effect on me, as I kept replaying the events of the murder and the actions of other characters in my head even after I finished the book. It was that mezmerizing!<br />I truly loved the way in which suspicion was cast on almost every character in the book. I began to look rather cautiously at the characters for fear of mentally befriending the wrong person. Christie's magic was so good that I was even beginning to think that everyone ganged up together to murder the poor Mr. Ackroyd. I especially was attracted to the cute little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who seems to possess a certain wizardry and deep intuition when it comes to mysteries and unearthing the truth.<br />The ending is indeed a surprise - as I understand is Christie's trademark. I only wish I read the book twice (both times up until the point of the revealing of the murderer) so as to make a good guess as to who the murderer really was. Oh well, perhaps I'll save that for the next Agatha Christie special.
B000021Y74|2.0|Franka Potente stars in a thrilling, but all together mis-directed new style movie from Germany.  The main character in the film, Lola, is forced to make several dramatic and radical feats to help raise thousands of DM's for her less than appealing boyfriend Manni in order to pay off some gangsters.  A radical new approach to directing is taken throughout the film, with heavy emphasis on music and an almost surreal style of split screen action between different characters.  An incredible use of different cinematography and angle points is also used, ( Not to mention some usage of animated scenes)  which are also stunning.  Unfortunatly for this film, the approach is not enough.  The story is often muddled and confusing, and the characters are very briefly outlined. But you have to look at what the movie was made for.  The director obviously intended this to be an experiment, he sacrificed the plot in order to try out some new, radical approach to filmaking.  Not for everyone, but give it a try if you want something different.
6305922756|5.0|There's such a fine line between clever and stupid, and the first time I watched this I thought it was stupid. I have since watched it about six times, and it gets better every time. Give it a couple changes; it is great!
6304457383|5.0|Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin star in a dark thriller that is a true shocker.  Hepburn stars as a blind women in her apartment (Susy), that is routinely terrorized by a group of con-artist/henchmen led by Alan Arkin.  They seek a toy doll that was hidden in the blind woman's apartment that contains several packages of valuable cocaine.  Through the movie, (Which entire action takes place in a single room!  A Broadway replica film) the con men each take turns in trying to convince Susy to give them the location of the doll in the apartment.  A maddening, nail-biting thriller that SHOULD be watched in the dark.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and if you haven't seen it yet, do so.  It's a highly energized, inventive movie about fate, love, and coincidence (a theme so many directors have embraced recently).  Everything in his movie is expertly and effectively done: the camera work, editing gimmicks, especially the techno soundtrack.  The story is simple, short, and always entertaining.  The DVD is a good one, although the widescreen option it offers is not much different from the modified version on my TV.  The director's commentary is a nice feature and the sound options are excellent.
0375707972|4.0|The Reader was a beautiful and extraordinary love affair between two people, even though their age was quite a difference. I loved the romance of Schlink's quiet style. Having heard many horrible stories from that era, it was an interesting look into the lives of this mis-matched couple.<br />Having not heard anything about this book before reading it, it was definitely hard to put down. A very compelling look into the lives of these characters which were more a metaphor for the situation than that of a relationship between the two.
6304578458|5.0|Having seen quite a few of John Cusack's movies, I think this one hits exactly the right tone.  He often plays lovable loners or losers who somehow manage to get the girl.  In this film, he is the ultimate loner, a professional hitman, with very little to brag about at his 10-year high school reunion.  He can't even figure out what to tell people who ask him where he's been for the past 10 years, so he tells them the truth, but nobody believes him.<br />Cusack's character, Martin Blank, is filled with angst, and trying to work this out in therapy.  Unfortunately, his therapist (brilliantly underplayed by Alan Arkin), doesn't want to talk to him ever since Blank told the good doctor what he does for a living.  The interaction between Cusack and Arkin in this film is much funnier and more real than the Billy Crystal/Robert DeNiro shtick in &quot;Analyze This.&quot;<br />The heart of the film is the relationship between Blank and his high school sweetheart (Minnie Driver), whom he stood up on prom night 10 years before and never contacted again.  Blank is emotionally repressed and morally confused (which is why he is well-suited to be a hitman) but Driver is still crazy about him, not believing his statement about his chosen profession.  She has some huge trust issues though, what with being stood up on prom night, and all.  She is somewhat willing to give him another chance.  The playfulness of their interaction is charming, especially when it's tinged with irony and distrust.  She doesn't want to have sex with him right away, but she would like an &quot;airplane.&quot; (he holds her up with his feet while she pretends to fly)<br />The climatic scene, where Blank declares his love for Driver, acknowledges his own considerable shortcomings, and promises to change, meanwhile engaging in a gripping, over-the-top shootout with the bad guys, is absolutely perfect for what Cusack's character is about: he can't express himself unless he's pumped full of adrenaline in a battle to the death, but he doesn't want to stay trapped in this way of life.<br />All of the actors are wonderful, especially Joan Cusack as John's office manager and the person who needles him into going to his reunion and rejoining the human race.  Dan Akyroyd is also a hoot.<br />Everything works in this movie.  It's a black comedy/screwball romance/action flick with subtle, clever dialogue, cool music and beautiful scenery.  It is completely irreverent, but hopeful and life-affirming, as well.
B000020617|5.0|With 1999's \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose,\\" the Foo Fighters have placed themselves on a much higher level in rock, quickly becoming one of it's foremost groups. This album is driven by guitars and melody. With a definite classic rock influence on this album, this [song] is big and slickly produced. With lovely rock songs like \\"Learn To Fly,\\" which is basic fodder for these guys, and slave-to-the-grind screamers like \\"Stacked Actors,\\" this album is just a rock record. Nothign more, nothing less. The closest this album comes to old Foo territory is \\"M.I.A.\\" which is pretty alternative. \\"Next Year,\\" sounds like it came from Foriegner. \\"Generator,\\" is a true classic rock treasure, with the talk box that Peter Frampton used. The punkish \\"Breakout\\" snarls and is piercingly fresh to the pop-punk going on today and the glowy ballad \\"Aurora\\" basks in admiration from lead singer Dave Grohl, as the song is about his grandmother's passing. The album's one scar is the slow and odd \\"Ain't This The Life,\\" with it's ho-hum dreamy feel. The rest of the album takes charge though, and surpasses all the expectations Grohl has had to make since Nirvana fell through. The Foos have gained respect and national fame, and there looks like no less is coming from these new gods of rock.
B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie is a great Billy Wilder. It deserves the recognition it gets. Jack Lemmon is great as the nervous 'doormat' business man, who rents his apartment to his CEOs for them to have their affairs so Jack Lemmon can get a promotion. His character is great, and his style of nervous, jumpy, manic derpressive character is perfect for the part. You really get attached to him. The doctor who lives next to him is great as well. Shirley Maclaine, in her beauty, plays a confused and misused elevator attendant. Jack Lemmon falls in love with her, but she only likes the boss, who mis treats her badly. This is a great film, where people do very human things instead of acting like cliches. Sometimes I yelled at the screen to try to make them understand that they were doing the wrong thing. That's how involved I got to this movie. A masterpiece indeed.
B00000JZIK|5.0|This film has one of the best endings ever.  The build-up is exciting (albeit a little violent) and the climax is guaranteed to leave the audience breathless.  Kevin Spacey shines, with his mesmerising acting.  It is very difficult to review this film without giving away the suspense, hence I am not going to try to.  If you like suspense and do not mind a little violence, then this is a must-see film.
B00005ATQF|4.0|I bought this movie in a [retail store], not from Amazon. It was just a whim of mine that paid off. What I discovered was a fine, fine film about the confusion and terror of not only Vietnam itself, but of the brutal training of the day. The training was rushed under war conditions, so they had to be harder, sometimes (and in this film, many times) striking cadets. I think I like the training part of the film better, the acting, the tension, everything is very fascinating. So I think it's less a war movie, but a study of people under incredible stress. Some crack, like the spoiled cadet (Vincet D'Onofrio). The drill sergeant, who actually was a drill sergeant in Vietnam, is wonderful (Lee Ermy). It's very poignant. When you finally get to Vietnam, it seems like a whole new world (which it actually was). The humor is very adult. Prostitutes lure American G.I.s more than anything else. When this movie gets to Hue city, the site of heavy, bloody fighting in Vietnam, it is very realistic (despite being filmed in England). This movie is more about the dehumanizing effect of basic training more than anything else. Although the city fighting is less intense then that of SPR, it is perhaps more poignant, because you get to stop and think, (my god, that is horrendous), instead of just thinking, (okay, kill that nazi, oh god, he's got a panzershreck, kill him! kill him). The film is gritty and unfiltered, like SPR. But unlike Kubrick's first war movie, Paths of Glory, this movie is not openly anti-war. When the men off the platoon are being interviewed, the main emotion conveyed is confusion, not outright protest. I really like the part in the film when the two dead men are surrounded by the squad, and the camera circles around everyone. I especially like Animal Mother's (Adam Baldwin) reaction, &quot;Better you than me.&quot; No cheesy compassion, just outright &quot;selfishness.&quot; But it really isn't. That is what goes through many soldier's minds, even though they do form strong bonds, &quot;If we go out together against that sniper, I'd rather it be you that's hit.&quot; A good film. However, it doesn't evoke the same emotion that platoon does, because platoon is so anti war. The horror of Vietnam is not conveyed as well in this movie as in platoon. I recommend it, but please, please see platoon.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|this movie is the best there is. it makes you think &quot;if i could go back in time what would i change?&quot; to anyone who has lost a loved one this movie will touch your heart and make you wish your loved ones were with you. the movie also has a beautiful soundtrack everyone should see this movie.
B00005B6C9|5.0|This is another Bee Gee masterpiece! I love all the songs especially Embrace! The boys are so talented!  This cd shoud be a no. 1 hit!
6303269869|4.0|This movie may not be in the 'Days of Wine and Roses' league, in which the great, departed Jack Lemmon deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar. It is, however, a very significant film for me personally. Dealing very sensitively with alcoholism, the performances given by its two main stars, Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia, are, in my view, underestimated. I have watched this movie several times. I am a huge Meg Ryan fan, and, whilst this is not my personal favourite of hers, I feel that it proves that she is too good an actress to be typecast in romantic comedies. She looks the part as the alcoholic, and I intend to be merely complimentary in this assessment; Andy Garcia, equally, is fine as the 'al-anon' husband, with whom so many spouses can associate. I suppose I am somewhat biased in my opinion, as, not only am I a massive Meg addict, I have also (like Meg's character) pulled through alcohol addiction. For me, the scene towards the end of the video, where she, at the alcohol treatment centre, makes a speech, to declare that she has been sober for 184 days, is very poignant. I saw this movie when I was at my lowest ebb, traumatised by alcohol addiction. This scene was to save me, as I thought, if Meg can do it, so can I! Therefore, I white-knuckled it through 184 days, just like Meg, and I am now nearly at my fourth 184 days, after nearly two years of sobriety. I'll never know whether this film would have had such a profound effect on me if someone else had played that part. But, in my view, no-one else would have been able to play that part to such good effect. The carefree girl from 'When Harry Met Sally', reduced to alcoholism. That's why it was effective, and, for me, a life saver. So a big thank you to Meg Ryan, and not to forget Andy Garcia. Seeing an alcoholic deteriorate through the eyes of a loved one is always inspiring to those who wish to combat the illness. Not a great movie, as I said earlier, but a very underrated one. It saved this reviewer's life.
0380973650|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman as much as most of his fans, having followed his progress through the Sandman series as well as his previous novels.  As previous comments have stated, Gaiman chooses to expand on his old ideas of religion and gods.  As usual, I found his theories deeply interesting and thought provoking, although far from unique.  Asian folk religions have often held that ancestors require food and worship to stay strong, and that with enough worship, these ghosts ascend to ranks of deities.<br />However, I found it disconcerting that in the process of discussing dozens of religions, he fails to mention Buddhism once.  As for Christianity, Jesus gets a passing mention as a hitchhiker.  If you have read Sandman(which 80% of his audience probably has), you will know that the Christian-Judeo God is portrayed as far more powerful than any of the lower deities, although he is hardly mentioned at all.  Because this god does not have emotions and adventures like the other ancient ones(and is thus void of human traits) Gaiman chooses to avoid writing about him(or her).  Although I am not Christian, I live in a country where an astounding number of people are, and thus to write about America without mentioning Christianity seems ridiculous.  The only explanation I could think of is that the Judeo-Christian God is above all the events in the story, looking down benignly.  I would think that history has shown that faith in this God has not remained as strong as it once was, and thus he is succeptible to the same fate as Odin and the others.<br />I did like the book, but the lack of major religions startled me.  I understand that the plot is about gods who have lost their worship base, but ignoring several religions that have key roles in the definition of America's past and present seems a bit jarring.
0345350499|5.0|I've read so many of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books that I honestly don't recall whether this was the first.  I suspect that it was, since the subject matter is of particular interest to me.  Bradley's view on the classic Arthurian cycle is presented from a new perspective:  that of Morgaine la Fey.  Morgaine is presented as a Druid priestess in this novel ... representing the Old Ways, and their juxtaposition with the new Christian faith.  In many ways, Morgaine is a victim of circumstance and the plotting of those around her ... a far more sympathetic view than is ordinarily given of Arthur's stepsister.  This novel is sometimes referred to as a &quot;feminist perspective on the Arthurian tales&quot; -- as though this were somehow damning.  I'm not certain that I find it entirely feminist ... just something like the other side of the story.  Highly recommended to those interested in Arthurian lore.
6301607929|5.0|i have never ever watched a movie like picnic!!!!! i have seen this movie over a hundred times and the dance scene between holden and novac is so erotic and sensual! it puts to shame all of the r-rated movies of today without language and nudity.i hope to watch this movie over and over again.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Frankly, I didn't understand what all the hype was about. I picked up this album about the time it came out, a friend of mine recommended it to me. I've never listened to Radiohead before, but i am a fan of Pink Floyd and the Beatles, and i have no idea how someone could comment that Radiohead has the same style. Even with Roger Waters, Pink Floyd's sound was never so...slow. Even on their most mellow CD's (the wall for example) you still have tracks which speed things up, tracks like &quot;another brick in the wall&quot; or &quot;run like hell&quot; pick up the pace. EVERYTHING on OKC is slow and mellow. By having that slow a tempo, OKC just goes on and on... i think this would be okay if they interesting lyrics. <br />       Actually, i think this album would be alot better if i could understand what Yorke was singing. It sounds like he mumbled the entire album in his sleep. Even the lyrics booklet was unreadable. When I first listened to it i thought, &quot;no problem I'll just read the lyrics instead of listening to them&quot; but when I opened the book, the lyrics were almost as incomprehensible as yorke's voice. Half of the lyrics look like they came out of an E. E. cummings poem! I didn't even know it was a concept album until i read the reviews. <br />       Although some of the guitar work is interesting, and the sound effects are cool. Lyrical incomprehension(I don't mean understanding the words, I'm  talking about trying to figure out what they said) brings this album way down. And its slow pace does little except to make Yorke's voice even more annoying. I don't even know how other people managed to understand the lyrics, perhaps they found them on the internet(which, according to you reviewers who think this is a lyrical work of art, is exaclty what the album was criticizing).
6305508550|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It's so funny, don't bother renting it, just buy it!  From the first scene to the last scene I was almost always laughing.  All the actors are good, and the mumbling guy is great.  See it now!
0312243022|2.0|If you want to read this book because it won the Pulitzer, don't be so stupid.  Granted, this is a very well-written book, replete with great metaphors and a very successful omniscient narrative.  But it's so boring, even though it's about lesbians.  Wait until this book is made into a movie, or becomes a prerequisite for a college class.
078401213X|2.0|The first half of this film is suggestive and intriguing.  The second half becomes concrete and, while not exactly dull, let's say that the tremendous possibilities of the opening collapse to a single and rather prosaic storyline.  By doing some, albeit limited, research into mathematics, Aronofsky succeeds in evoking the mystery in maths' connection with the ordinary world - however, a little more research or imaginative effort might have powered the film to still greater heights.  This adds up to a shallow take on a profound subject, and it trades on the subject's genuine profundity in order to gives itself airs.  Still many of the techniques rehearsed here see fruition in 'Requiem for a Dream', the latter being a much more satisfying piece of work.
B000001ESF|4.0|I first heard this album in an art lesson when I was 12 (we had cool teachers) and loved it although I (and i'm sure everyone else) thought that the female singer had a high voice - little did we realise.  It's quite a tribute to Rush that all of their 70's albums have a different feel, this album obviously has the mad space rock vote - being mainly a 20 minute song about a future resident of some planet or other finding a guitar in a cave and being persecuted for expressing himself by learning how to play it. It's all twaddle of course but if you have a sense of humour &amp; a love of great music this will only make it sound even better. I think that even the band themselves realise how silly it all is by taking it less than 100% seriously when they play it these days. The second side is more mellow with more acoustic guitars that later albums although the last song 'something for nothing' is a great overlooked Rush rocker. If you want to have one of the best prog rock album of the 70's (together with Van Der Graf Generator's Pawn Hearts) or you want something to annoy your cool friends then buy this - NOW MISTER!
B000031WD9|1.0|This film is not funny.  It is very poorly scripted.  On stepping into the cinema, I was hoping for an evening's mindless entertainment: and while what I witnessed was sufficiently mindless, it failed to qualify as entertainment.  Do yourself a favour and spend your hard earned money on a real life apple pie - and eat it - you'll be much more satisfied.
B000006YBO|4.0|the first time through, I really dug it. repeated listenings left me puzzled. the whole thing sounds like the lovechild of sabbath and skynyrd - which means that the guitars are heavy and, oddly enough, sweet. whether you dig it will depend on your feelings about phil. he stretches out and tries on a lot of vocal masks from the trad anselmo barking growl to highly shredded black metal screechings. however, he sometimes sounds like EDDIE FREAKING VEDDER. HUH!? this disc made me think about death (what would I be willing to die for?) and money (was this an attempt from some relatively hardcore dudes to go mersh?). What will it make you think about (if it makes you think, at all)?

B000000WCV|5.0|Daft punk is one of the best sounds out there and has a very distinguished sound and no current genre really can describe it, this CD is more Disco and techno than pop but pop plays a big part in &quot;Discovery&quot;-which I highly recomend. The only problems are that the songs here are a little diferent from most others, but by no means less enjoyable, and some of the songs are trash, OH YEAH IS THE LAMEST THING ON EARTH! This music is the best for listening to while doing something else, like reading, or shopping for their next CD.

B00005JG6Q|1.0|Ok, the quality of the audio is nice, but they re-recorded the entire audio track.  I might be an old biased grump but the old audio and voices was 100 times more enjoyable than this.  Even with the original japanese audio, which is good, the subtitles have changed to reflect the new translation which manages to ruin even that.  I'd wait until a version is released with the old audio.
6304626495|5.0|Determined Python fans have their preferences, and for some, LIFE OF BRIAN isn't the funniest.  They might compare it to their favorite bits from HOLY GRAIL or MEANING OF LIFE.  Yet this film is exemplary for sustaining the story of Brian, a young dissident who scorns Roman rule and is mistaken for the messiah, through to the end.  Without any didactic aims, it pokes fun at the way human beings anoint and follow religious figures.  The script is very strong, as are the performances. It remains their strongest movie.<br />The charges of blasphemy are misplaced.  The very first scene of the film establishes this: the three wise men make a mistake when they bring their gifts to Brian, catch their mistake, and take their gifts back (rather abruptly) when they discover the true Christ child in the stable next door.  <br />What follows is a comedy that makes no complaint against Jesus or God.  It is all about religious behavior amongst the rest of us, as well as self-interested political activism (&quot;We are NOT the Judean People's Front...We are the People's Front of Judea!&quot;).  Brian, our good-hearted hero, gets tragically caught up in the madness which, while exaggerated for Pythonesque comedic effect, feels very familiar.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Who pulled the wool over our eyes? As a people, we have been bamboozled, we have been hornswaggled, into believing in a horrible fallacy, a lie so big even the Nazis would quake in awe. I'm not talking about our electoral process. I'm not talking about the constant misinterpretation of the Second Amendment, or the belief that whites are somehow superior to all other races.  But who in the hell told us that &quot;Traffic&quot; was a good movie?   So what do we have here, we have like eighteen different intertwining stories that all mesh into a web of cocaine-encrusted celluloid. For starters, we've got Michael Douglas as Bob Wakefield, the brand-new head of the United States Drug Prevention Initiative Policy Blah Blah Blah. Hole Number One. No head of drug prevention in these United States would be as absolutely clueless as Judge Wakefield. Oh yeah, he's a judge! The guy has no idea how drug trafficking works, doesn't know any of the statistics or the ins and outs of the drug trade in America, and he's the most qualified for the job? Forget it.  Okay.  So his daughter is on crack. Did I mention that? His daughter is a bonafide crack addict. No pot, barely any booze, straight to the premium: snorting and freebasing. Meanwhile, her father serves as the audience proxy, an earpiece for all of screenwriter Stephen Gaghan's impressive research. So eventually his daughter runs away from her drug retreat and begins sleeping with her crack dealer for free rock, realizing a rich father's worst nightmare:  his daughter is sleeping with a black man.  All right, enough plot summary. That's for movie reviews, and this ain't a movie review, it's a venting session. Is there anyone reading right now who doesn't think that the War on Drugs only fuels the drug trade in the country, and that it's probably a front for a massive government importing conspiracy? No? Anyone? No? Good. Then don't see the movie. Because that's all they say for two and a half hours. I felt like my brain was going to explode. I haven't hated a movie this much since I saw &quot;Magnolia&quot; and almost chewed out my medulla oblongata.  The only real bright spots in the movie came from Don Cheadle and Luis Guzmn, FBI drug investigators who also happen to be great actors. The usually wonderful Michael Douglas comes off as preachy and nave, while the usually stellar Benicio del Toro - Academy Award winner for Best Supporting Actor for this role, by the way - never changes his facial expression and is just barely vindicated in one of the most saccharine-sweet, manipulative movie endings since &quot;Free Willy.&quot;  Don't get me started on wunderkind-of-the-year Steven Soderbergh's directing mishaps. Nearly half of the movie was shot on a hand-held camera, producing a theatre-wide seasickness not rivaled since &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and not done half as well. The rest of the movie consisted of artsy trick angles - including an upside-down shot of Douglas's helicopter that made no sense - bright-light shots reminiscent of &quot;Heathers,&quot; and shots of nature having nothing to do with the rest of the film.  The only bright spot in Soderbergh's messy montage of mediocre vignettes was the section of the movie dealing with the cartel wars in Tijuana. The slightly-off style of shooting, the yellowed color of the film, and the impersonality of the shots made you realize that this was a completely different world. For the most part, however, someone should tell Steven Soderbergh that he shouldn't try to be Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone tried that, and we got &quot;Any Given Sunday.&quot; So watch out.  Anyway, I've never felt so gypped as I did coming out of that movie. Let me set the record straight:  &quot;Traffic&quot; sucks. Go spend your money on &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; or see a NASCAR race, or BEAT YOUR HEAD AGAINST A WALL but do NOT see this movie. Unless you already have. In which case, may God have sweet mercy on your soul.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an excellent book with a great storyline and well developed characters. The book will never loose your attention. (I have read it in a single sitting a countless number of times) I love the way OSC makes you think and how he makes you internally debate moral issues. I highly recommend this book!!
B00003CXB2|5.0|Still a wonderful movie.  Enjoyed watching and will watch again soon.  A bit costly though.  Cleopatra, released the same day, was half the cost.  Anybody got a glass of water?

B00005JG6Q|5.0|Akira has been a long time coming on the DVD format, but it was WELL worth the wait.  This is THE classic Anime, a masterpiece indeed.  All I can say is just check out the film. It's filled with stunning imagery, a complex and fascinating story, a GREAT soundtrack, and a mind blowing ending.  It's a real stunner of a film.  As for the DVD, Pioneer has done a splendid job in presenting Akira.  The transfer is GREAT as is the incredible sound.  The second disk of the set is jam packed with extras exploring the film. GREAT stuff this is.  And the packaging is AWESOME!  The limited edition is definitely the one to buy, if you can find it by now that is.  Very highly recommeded.
6304437730|5.0|I loved it. It was great. No bad words or nothing.
6304030959|2.0|Chris Van Allsburg's picture book &quot;Jumanji&quot; was a beautiful but very odd and erie story for older children and adults. I can say the same thing for this movie version, though I think it hardly holds up as well in film form. First off, parents take note: this is a sad and scary film. A boy gets sucked into a board game about the jungle and, unlike Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, is never able to return home. When some other children conjure him out of the game thirty years later, he is physically grown (played by Robin Williams), used to living rather like a savage, and bewildered and saddened that the world has moved on and he has lost his family and his entire youth. Really, this is scary stuff if your child is at all insecure. Furthermore, the game unleashes on the modern world a group of ferocious and destructive animals. The effects are good, and older viewers might enjoy seeing the animals smash up a town. There are a few laughs in this too, but as I say, this is really sort of a younger version of &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; and not appropriate for kids younger than 8. The plot is really pretty haphazard here, and I give it a thumbs down.
1573221562|4.0|In Affinity, Margaret Prior has become a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison. The superintendant thinks that visiting the women and teaching them of manners and the outside world will assist them in their rehabilitation.<br />Margaret is drawn to several of the women, and the portraits of their lives and crimes are brilliantly drawn.  She is especially fond, however, of one prisoner: Selina Dawes.  Selina is a spirit-medium, and as Margaret comes to know more of her and her story she becomes even more drawn to Selina, to the point of obsession.  Margaret comes to realize that the women in the gaol are not the only ones in prison; but that she is imprisoned by her family, her society, and her inability to express her forbidden longings.<br />The book tells brilliantly of Victorian society, and of women's place in the world.

B000001EHS|5.0|I think DEF LEPPARD is a great band. This cd is awesome if you have a chance buy it....you won't regret it. If you ever get a chance watch Hysteria: The story of Def Leppard.

0671027344|5.0|I bought this book unaware that it was a &quot;teen novel&quot;.  I still would not have known if there wasn't conterversy regarding the content at a local high school here.  I found this book taking me to my &quot;cool days&quot; when there was a group of friends that meant everything, and did everything with.  What made it more memorable was that Charlie is exactly my age, and that it took place at the same time I had a special group of friends that all thought we were &quot;infinite&quot;.  This was very fulfilling.  I recommended this to anyone who has a group of friends from your coming of age years that you will never forget, even if you aren't friends with them anymore.<br />The characters were well developed and believeable.  The whole time I knew there was something more to Charlie, and was happy to read the explaination at the end.

B00005BJPO|5.0|I've always loved Japanese animation, and Akira is the best movie to ever come along. When I first saw it, it was on tape, and previosly viewed. The quality seemed OK, and I still like the original dub, too. A few years ago, I set out a search for the movie on video to buy, but I couldn't find it anywhere (except ebay, but I don't like it much). Then, I found out it was being re-released on DVD and tape, and I was astonished! I reserved it as fast as I could, and waited. I just got it, and after work, I watched it. There was a sparkle in my eye, as the picture of the film was greatly increased, the sounds were completly re-done, and the music is, for lack of a better word, &quot;perfect&quot;. I haven't been so amazed by a movie in my life, and I really can't think of enough words to sum it all up. If you have never seen this before, at least rent it, but I have a good feeling that once you've seen it at it's best,you'll probably want to buy it, and it will appear in your DVD player time and time again.
B00004YKUY|3.0|I have listened to many Journey albums.  As a matter of fact, Journey Infinite was my very first rock n' roll album and it was on vinyl.  Anyway, the music on this album is impressive, but the overall material with the vocals and the lyrics is not that great.  There are some good hooks to enjoy, but it's hard for me to listen to the album anymore.  I liked it at first, but have grown to dislike it.  I was initially impressed with the new vocalist, but the lyrics were a little too corny and generic.  There is not that much difference between this new guy and Steve Perry, but the difference makes a big difference in the whole scheme of their music.  Steve Perry seemed to have more heart and soul in his singing.  This new guy feels stiff and calculated.
B00005BJPO|3.0|I have to say, I'm a huge fan of Akira, have been for a while. I was geeked to hear about the restoration effort Pioneer was putting into this DVD. Just got mine today, and only watched about half an hour, just to see. I have to say, my first impression... the voices are all wrong. Not all of them, and some of the lines are better, I'd admit, but there's something missing in this new dub. Examples: where the 1st test subject we see screams and the glass explodes? the new dub is missing some of the extra echo scream in that scene and boy, does it make a difference. Also, the voice for the 2nd test subject, the one in the wheel chair, sounds too much like Ralph Wiggum from the Simpsons. I really wish they'd included the original dub on here, even if it meant dumping the Japanese language track. That's probably sacrilegious to some, but I'd rather see this wonderful film the way I remember... and really, with all the potential of DVD, why not have them all, for all tastes? This release suffers from the new dub, I have to say. Looks great, but missing the great original voices... too bad.
B000002N1E|5.0|By whatever name he is called, Prince is a musical genius whose talent is boundless. &quot;The Gold Experience,&quot; like most of his post-&quot;Purple Rain&quot; releases, may not have garnered commercial success, but it is still eons above anything available on the market today. The album is as fresh today as it was upon its release six years ago. Each song begins with a spoken intro that sets the stage for the lyrical message to follow and the music freely bounces from the passionate to the enigmatic to the downright funky.<br />The best cuts are &quot;P Control,&quot; &quot;Shhh,&quot; &quot;We March,&quot; the hit single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,&quot; &quot;319,&quot; &quot;I Hate You,&quot; and the title cut.<br />Prince ranks with Mozart, Gershwin, and others as one of the preeminent influences in musical history.<br />&quot;The Gold Experience&quot; allows his wizardry to shine brightly.
0425163407|5.0|I just got bored one day and I read P. Cornwell's 'Unnatural Exposure.' It's a compelling story and has a great plot. However, I ended up being right about who the psycho was. However, it was still a good book......
0790741164|4.0|Whether or not the film answers the questions surrounding the death of President Kennedy, it does boast bravura performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and, in a small yet memorable cameo, Larry Hagman.  John Williams also contributes a very subtle yet powerful score, simultaneously ominous and poignant.
B00004WGYA|5.0|First and foremost, Rio is a fantastic example of five very good musicians coming together and producing some great music.  The rhythm section of the Taylors (John and Roger in particular) is superb.  If you are a fan of tight bass and drum work, look no farther than Rio as an example of fine playing in a pop context.<br />My only beef with this recording is the result of being conditioned to expect the remixed versions of the songs that were on the original vinyl version I bought in the early '80s.  I have a copy of the 'Night Versions' CD, but I'm still not hearing the mixes I expect.  As a big fan of John Taylor's bass playing, I feel that the remixed versions really highlighted his parts.<br />Attention Marketing Department: there is a small but devoted group of people who are willing to pay a premium to get the remixed edition of Rio on CD.<br />All in all, however, this is a fantastic piece of work and I recommend it highly.

1577311523|5.0|In this day and age when just about every book, film or TV program is lauded as &quot;unbelievable&quot; or &quot;incredible,&quot; Tolle's book comes along and actually deserves the praise. Over the years, I have read many new age, pop psychology, spiritual, and self-help books, some of which resonated, some of which did not, all of which left me still hungry, still a bit empty.<br />Tolle's book is the real deal. I could be wrong, of course, but I cannot imagine ever needing another spiritual guide because Tolle explains our basic nature in such easy, self-evident (but forgotten) terms. Cliches aside, this book truly has changed my life.
0380817683|4.0|Absolutely loveed this book!  Read it on vacation in about 6 hours and could not put it down.  Loved the way you get to see Rachel's perpspective as she goes through a comic recovery in drug rehab- but is not depressing at all.  You fall in love with Rachel and are totally rooting for her all the way through... great ending, except I was sad when it was all done!
0618002251|5.0|I read the Lord of the Rings saga and The Hobbit after careful persuasion of several of my friends who were totally enthralled by the books.  From the first couple lines of the Hobbit (&quot;In a hole there lived a hobbit.  Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole filled with ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat; it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort&quot;) to the discovery of the ring, and to the heroic triumph of the fellowship of the rings, I was totally and completely spell-bound.  The imagery was excellent, everything was described as if though it was alive right outside your window or taking place in your most vivid dreams.  The characters are the most extraordinary in the entire fantasy world, from the faithful Sam, to the powerful Gandalf, and finally to the insidious Sauron, everyone of them came alive as if you knew them all of your life.  The plot line and the brief glimpses of Middle Earth history in the books gave the series an added depth that transcended any fantasy book written before and even after.  These books are the paradigm of all fantasy books written there after and all writers incorporate some of the basic ideas of Tolkien found in this series.  <br />Tolkien was a devout man of faith and as such he wrote these books not only to entertain, but to teach important life and spiritual lessons to those who read them.  Many of his ideas for this series come from the Bible.  For this reason these books are strongly recommended for kids to read, even though they are difficult books to understand.  The books are enjoyable for anyone who reads them and is definetly recommended for everyone.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|This is one of the best anime I've seen in a while.  The animation is incredible, made even moreso when you consider that this was done in the 80's using nothing but traditional cell animation. Even at that, it is still good even by today's standards.  <br />Art: The painstaking detail they put in it is nothing short of incredible. Akira's cell animation gives many of todays CGI a run for it's money<br />Music: Fitting and really get's the blood pumping at action scenes <br />It also a bit tamer than most other anime out there...which could be bad or good depending on how you look at it.<br />Nudity/sex: Virtually non-existant.  Only one VERY brief scene showing a womans chest area compared to the continuous and rather uneccessary nudity of...let's say...Ghost in the Shell.<br />Violence/Gore: It definately has it's share, but it's kept as realistic as possible. It's not the 100's of gallons of blood under extreme high pressure just waiting to rain down and turn everything red like...let's say...Ninja Scroll.<br />It takes a healthy attention span, but it's not too hard to follow...at least as far as anime goes. Over all, it's a very solid animation.
0066620694|5.0|In my 15 years in high tech, I've seen many established companies being done in by smaller competitors.  While this is going all we would all shake our heads at the stupidity of the management of the large companies ... couldn't they see the trends?<br />This book gives the first lucid explanation of why this happens.  It shows that the managers were not being stupid.  On the contrary, they were doing exactly what their customers wanted them to do ... and what they could afford to do.<br />This book also lays out an excellent foundation that allows you to recognize the pattern and accurately predict where it could happen again.<br />Great work!
B0000025F7|4.0|Michael Jackson was a big child star with the Jackson Five.  He even had a couple of hits as a solo artist in his youth.  However, with the release of Off The Wall, Michael matured not only as a man but as a recording artist with a fine collection of songs.  There are a variety of textures from the slow evocative She's Out Of My Life to the percussion dance number Don't Stop Till You Get Enough.  Rock With You, Its The Falling In Love, and Off The Wall are three smooth dance numbers which will bring out the romantic in almost.  Burn This Disco Out will get you booging onto the floor.  Not quite on the level of Thriller but surely very close.  Soul/R&amp;B fans should have this and others should give it a try.  Its a leading seller of its era for good reason.
630027120X|5.0|This movie is about a world community in South America, The Guarangi Indians.  Many Jesuit priests have gone into the jungle areas and built missions for these people, for the purpose of converting them to Christianity.   \\"Forcing\\" a religion or  culture upon someone often will not end up with the desired results.  This movie portrayed the priests as kind and not forceful.  They were in the middle of the jungle to help these people in all ways, not just spiritually. The priests were portrayed as having the purest of intentions.  One such priest was a man who had murdered his brother over a woman and was seeking to pay penance with the Jesuits.  He stood up in defense of the Guarangi in a hearing to decide their status as men or animal.  His vehemence in their defense posed against the other men actually hurt the cause, though her apologized later.   The theme that shown through to me is that the best of intentions may not be enough to spare conflict when two cultures meet.  The Jesuit priests came to do good, but in the end what they did led to the brutal killing of many Guarangi.  I remember the statement of the Judge who was to determine the fate of the missions and of these people.  He was visiting the mission mostly depicted throughout the film. He said as he looked into the eyes of the people he wondered if they truly wished that they(the white men) had never come in contact with them.  The Jesuits gave them a home, but in the end the home they gave them led to their destruction.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Why is Rear Window so important? FIRST, because it sums up all the elements that made Hitchcock a master among directors. It presents his vision of what Cinema was all about. It has a flawless screenplay with, director, stars and technicians at their peak form. SECOND, because Rear Window is one perfect example of the production triumphs the studio-system industrial line of work could generate . THIRD, because it is not just a classical work: it shows the evolution from the classical period in film history towards modern cinema. FOURTH, because it is one perfect example of mastering a technique.<br />I will not bother with the story (which by now, I guess everybody already knows it - a man on a wheelchair watching his neighbors from his window... the crime... etc.) because the story is just one small aspect of what makes this film great. In fact, what it is important to point out is that this story (which is very simple) was translated into a screenplay structurally perfect. This perfection gives depth to the characters, amplifies relationships and oppositions (the stuff drama is made of) and makes the viewer an active part of the spectacle. The viewer works his way through the film and sees things we do not see very often on today's commercial cinema.<br />Plus it is now on DVD. Restored. The image is beautiful and the sound is fine dolby mono 2.0 (although I was expecting a stereo soundtrack when I heard the DVD restoration was coming). The extras are fine (could be improved). Anyway, when the work is that great, who complains about small things? An absolute gem that demands multiple viewings and endless analysis.<br />My favorite line: Thelma Ritter's &quot;When General Motors has to go to the bathroom 10 times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.&quot;
0738203335|2.0|I like the cover, but nothing could interest me less than Linux or any software that ends with ..ux, ok maybe an IBM anthology of punch-card machines would be less interesting.<br />To me the best thing about Linux is that it comes as a free CD on the cover of magazines providing me with an endless supply of coffee casters.

B00005JG6Q|4.0|I had to watch this movie 5 or 6 times at different times in my life to understand what was going on.  I admit, I was a little young when I first saw it, back in 1989 when it was released on video. Akira was awesome and my first anime since such U.S. conversions as StarBlazers and Robotech.  It's very much a strong story with great art.  The motorcycle scenes are so cool, with the light trails...  The whole secret experiment element is still prevalent in today's stories...  Back in the day, THIS was the anime that all strived to be like. Unfortunately, there is one major problem.  The voice acting isn't nearly as convincing as in the original!  Kaneda and his group don't sound like teenage punks.  And the dialogue has been changed (tweaked here and there) just enough to throw us older types off.  Apparently, Pioneer was trying to get the dialogue closer to the original story, which doesn't always work. I'm glad I only bought the movie and not the special edition.  In any case, this is an anime that should be in your collection because this was a pioneer anime.  And remember, this was BEFORE Ghost in the Shell or Princess Monoke.  It's a classic like Bladerunner. Have fun.
B000051VWW|3.0|This is not a bad recording by any means.  Sade is still in fine voice and her band sets a soothing background.  However, ths songs in this batch are just not as catchy as on previous releases.  King of Sorrow, All About Our Love, and Immigrant are probably the stand out pieces mostly because of the  tone created by Sade and her band.  The Slave Song is completely devoid of any hooks.  By Your Side is a pleasant number but over relies on a repetive chord pattern.  A good sax or guitar solo would have helped. Several of the other songs rely a bit too much on a hip hop beat.  Good yes but not quite up to the level of Diamond Life or Stronger Than Pride.
B00004TJTS|3.0|This was a sweet movie about someone's memories of his boyhood dog while growing up in Mississippi in the 40's. They did a good job with the atmosphere and the lead character (played by the star of &quot;Malcolm In The Middle&quot;) was endearing. They seemed to leave a couple of subplots hanging though, such as the relationship with the black boy and the WWII veteran. Perhaps they had to cut those down for time. What really bugged me was the Father's injury occuring during the Spanish Civil war. I thought the only Americans that fought in that one were mercenaries or romantics (either political or otherwise). I didn't think we had an official presence there. The character of the father as portrayed by Kevin Bacon didn't strike me as someone who would fight for money or love. This was based on a true story, so perhaps they just dispensed with a full development of that character. That would have made for a very interesting subplot, but maybe too adult for the target audience.
B00005B36H|2.0|Schism is an excellent track, but unfortunately the rest of the album is a series of uninspiring, unmelodic songs that drone, for the most part, in E-minor.  Tool put alot of time into the song Schism and the album cover, but needed to pay more attention to making a complete album.  I was dissappointed.

B00003CXV4|4.0|Charlize Theron brings on her charm, and Keanu Reeves turns in a surprisingly worthy performance in &quot;Sweet November,&quot; a movie that's as light as a fall breeze. Slammed by most critics as a soggy romance with no star chemistry, the movie's premise centers around two people who, through an unlikely series of events, fall in love, though not without hardship. <br />Let it be known, the movie is not that bad. In fact, when put in comparison with movies like &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Planner,&quot; &quot;Sweet November&quot; is actually kind of refreshing in it's own little way. Yes, the way in which the two develop their romance is a bit tough to swallow at first, but if you can ignore that and allow their growing relationship to touch your heart, then the movie succeeds on those terms. <br />Keanu Reeves plays Nelson Moss, a man who is all work and no play (when leaving for work one morning, he tells his girlfriend, &quot;I have a life, and I'm late for it&quot;) as a big ad executive. While taking a test at the DMV, he runs into Sara Deever, played by Charlize Theron, who gives him an answer and gets caught cheating. What does Sara do? She milks the situation for everything she can in order to get Nelson to her home. <br />Her offer? To allow him to live in her house for a month, no more, no less, in order to help him get rid of all of his life's stresses and restrictions. She takes it to the extreme, too, giving his clothes to a homeless man, telling him he cannot go to work (he got fired, anyway), and taking him out into the town to show him the ways in which life can be fun. <br />Like any movie relationship, there are complications. Sara is reluctant to reveal anything about her past or her family, or her reasons for taking in a new man each month. All she will reveal is what she does to help each one of them. Near the end, there will come a revelation that will put the stability of their bond in jeopardy. <br />It seems preposterous, butwith a movie like this, the events come in such an order that you can forgive these little pitfalls. Their budding romance really does have a kick to it, and despite the outside criticism, Theron and Reeves do have some good onscreen chemistry that lights up the screen in moments and provides for some very touching moments. <br />The film also has a lot of warm-hearted laughs. A scene in which Sara stands outside Nelson's apartment and begins shouting risque comments at people in order to gain his attention will have you chuckling, while her neighbors, two homosexuals who host a dinner party for the four of them in drag, are a riot. And the overall sweet nature of the relationship between the two is something to smile about, as well as shed a few tears over. <br />In one of his better roles, Keanu Reeves is convincingly emotional as Nelson. In the beginning, her perfectly portrays the egotistical attitude and outlook of his character, and then makes a very believable segue to someone who is so in love he is willing to change his whole life. Charlize Theron is, as always, a gem, bringing a touch of warmth and cheerfulness to her role as Sara. Her acting embodies her character with the zest for life needed to sell us on Sara's motives, and Theron captures that completely. <br />While it's not on par with many other romances on the market, &quot;Sweet November&quot; is nowhere near as bad as critics have made it out to be. In fact, it's a charming movie that is very uplifting, due in part to the moving relationship that Reeves and Theron bring to their characters. It met all of my expectations, which were few, but the fact that it met them is enough to recommend the film.
0792844939|4.0|Godard maintains that this was Scorsese's greatest film--an outrageous claim but one that I can somewhat sympathize with. It is ironic that Scorsese's reputation is as a sort of gritty realist; in fact, his real subject has always been the slightly warped dream world of profoundly alienated individuals and the real mean streets his characters walk are not in New York but in a half-remembered, half-hallucinated Hollywood of the 40's and 50's. His often--perhaps too often-- repeated gesture is to place his lonely dreamers in collision with \\"reality\\" and to show it to be everybit as slippery as fantasy and just as inescapable. In this strange musical he seems to build a whole world out of bits of pop culture memories, cliches, and Hollywood images. This seems to be what attracted him to Liza Minnelli (There are several allusions and echoes of Vincent Minnelli here and Scorsese was one of the younger directors the old man most admired) and this interest on Scorsese's part works to the actress's disadvantage: while her famous parentage clearly resonates with the era and style Scorsese is exploring, her role is grossly underwritten and the director gives her little help, though she livens up considerably in some of her scenes with DeNiro. In fact the scene with the famous theme song came about when Scorsese saw Minnelli working in Vegas--which points up the extent to which he was more interested in the real Liza Minnelli than the character she was supposed to be creating.  (Upon completion of this film, Scorsese tried his hand at directing Minnelli in a full scale Broadway musical set in Vegas with disastrous results) The script is famously messy and unworthy of the director and his two stars but in spite of that grave fault, the film is full of strange, poetic images, a harshly brilliant and often funny performance by DeNiro (improvising wonderfully) and a spectacular soundtrack--the big band covers are first rate and Minnelli never sang better...In this ambitious mess of a movie Scorsese shows a sort of greatness far above anything in the more formally perfect but less interesting Raging Bull.  By the 1980s Scorsese seemed to have run out of inspiration, with films that either repeat things he had already done better earlier (Goodfellows) or hollow genre pieces (The Age of Innocence).  DeNiro, of course, had many more wonders to perform after New York, New York, but the economy and power of his work here remains one of the highlights of his career. Minnelli, alas, never really recovered professionally from this third big budget box office bomb after her Academy Award for Cabaret. She stopped growing as an artist, entered into a period of drug and alcohol abuse, and ultimately this quick and creative performer who had seemed to promise so much at one time became a sad and coarse self parody--a sort of Ethel Merman without the subtlety. But her best work, including this film, stands fast.
B000001IQH|5.0|Some people criticize this album because of the experimental ska on some tracks. But I love ska, and I love punk, and Rancid does the best job of blending the two since Operation Ivy (a band that just happened to have Matt and Tim from Rancid). Every song on here is great, but Ruby Soho, Maxwell Murders, Journey to the end of East Bay, and Olympia WA are the best. Rancid is one of the best bands ever, and this cd is only second best to the amazing aggressive hardcore punk of Rancid (1993). Just buy this cd if you're a fan of punk or ska/punk. You will not be dissapointed!
B00001NFCY|2.0|Ok, i was tempted to just bash creed, which i am sure would have been fun, but instead i will try to be constructive.  First off, all these people who seem so sure that creed is the greatest and that any person with good taste should like them need to just stop.  Unfortunatley most of the reviews on here are terribly one sided as either love/hate.  So let me first say that I don't hate creed... but by the same token it astounds me how popular they are and how many people seem to think their music is &quot;deep&quot;.  Music-wise creed is redoing an act which was done much much better in the early nineties.  Still, many of the songs are catchy and enjoyable to listen to if u just don't pay attention to the lyrics.... kind of like some Limp Bizkit or N'Sync songs.  There is nothing very interesting or creative about their songs, and the lyrics leave a whole lot to be desired.  Everytime i hear Arms Wide Open i just want to laugh the song is so damn cornball.  Scott needs to figure out that lyrics don't have to spell everything out for the audience.... and that it is hard to establish an identity when u sound so much like previous bands (vocally at least).  This is simply a radio friendly album that people who listen to top 40 will like, no more no less.  And no, i don't find the fact that they include religous themes in their music troubling, but rather it bothers me that they can't do something more creative musicly or lyriclly with a topic as deep and interesting as religion.  An popular example of a good song with religous undertones is Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam&quot; by the vasolines which was made famous by nirvana on their unplugged album.  So if u like unthoughtful radio friendly rock, then enjoy, if u want actual thought provoking poetic hard rock get up and buy a nirvana CD.
1573225517|5.0|As they say, the third one's the charm. This is my third book of the summer and clearly the best I have ever read in a long time. Nick Hornby weaves a classic tale of introspection on matters of the heart and the relationships we uphold. Is this a guy book, one might ask? No it's not! Guys can read it and find solace on how their actions are interpreted. Women can read it to truly understand why guys act the way they do. We're really big babies in the long end and no matter how old we get, we need that little bit of pampering from our women. We need that loving touch. We need to lie in their laps and have them play with our hair and tell us everything's fine. We just want to be held and never let go off. We need to be loved and accepted for who we are. And if they have the time and patience, accept us for what we are.<br />The first person narration works best with a book of this forte. This allows you to get inside the mind of the main character and truly see how he views the world around him and his various interpretations of his failed relationships. Hornby lets you be Rob throughout your read. There are times you get to be the character so well, that you can expect how he'd react to a certain situation. The character of Rob, the down to earth, vinyl records shopkeeper is your everyday shmoe. He's the person you see staring at you when you're brushing your teeth early in the morning. He's you... with all your flaws, all your qwirks, and all your ups and downs. No matter if you're a high profile lawyer, doctor or the guy who gets to paint the White House. All men have been made from the same cauldron.<br />Hornby takes you on a contemplative ride down the experience of the relationships between men and women. How they view each other. How they act when they're around each other. How they cannot live without each other. Or is it really how men cannot live without women??? And throughout the whole journey, you can't stop but think that that's you. You're Rob and your girl is Laura .... You can't help, but look at the human side of things and truly appreciate a very well woven story about love lost only to rise again from between the ashes. There are many metaphors and explanations thet you just can't help but think that they're true to how your life has or could become. It would seem that Hornby could have been a person who has watched anyone of us and based that story loosely on that. The style is very consistent and you can't but have a smile on your face throughout your read. There are moments that you just can't help but laugh out loud and if you're with people in the subway doing just that, it's off to the loonhouse you go. It has all the classic wry, self-sarcasm feel that British authors have been known for since the days of Shakespeare.<br />For an engaged man, or any man who's ever been involved, the book will have a different taste to it. Something extra. It will make you look back at your own life and think things that you just never thought were of import. You'd come out with exactly the same feeling Hornby injects into Rob as the book goes on, you learn to appreciate your partner and not take them for granted. You learn that no matter how you act up, they can always see something in you that no one in the world ever sees. The real you. And what can you do about it? There's nothing you can do actually, except fall in love over and over again.
B00004XONN|3.0|Don't get me wrong folks I think its a very innovative CD although it gets annoying at times to hear Thom Yorke whine about how technology is taking over our lives, he needs to loosen up and stop taking himself so seriously.  Anywho, this CD took a while to grow on me, the first time I heard the opening track (blehblehbleh kid A kid A) and the rest of the CD I thought this was pure rubbish and wouldve given this album one star but it later began to grow on me, this album takes a lot of time to grow on you and probably will not strike you after just one listen.  Despite the fact the album grew on me, it is my least favorite Radiohead album in my collection because I only can stand to listen to half the tracks still whereas the other albums I can listen to most or all of the tracks without skipping ahead.  Optimistic and Idioteque would have to be my two favorite songs on this album that dares to blow away the pop scene with unique, innovative music.  I recommend you buy this album and see if it grows on you, if you are the patient type you will not be disappointed.
0393317552|1.0|It took me only about ten pages to determine that the author has an agenda and is using the book to further it.  Here is a guy who embraces everything &quot;other civilizations&quot; offer and utterly rejects the contributions of western civilization.  Like his personal experience working on a ranch, where the only worthy individual was an American Indian.  Everyone else was some kind of scum.  I could only take enough examples of his distorted thinking, before I became ill with this garbage and put the book aside.  My great regret is my loss of money in buying this completely distorted and unwise edition.  This guy is responsible, in many ways,  for the thinking of so many kids coming out of our schools today who say (with feigned sagacity)  &quot;I won't be reading any books written by white European men.&quot;
0345350499|5.0|King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table by Thomas Mallory gave me nothing but bland, two-dimensional smoting and swoons.  I was ready to turn my back on the whole story when I heard about the Mists of Avalon from a friend.  It seemed awfully long, but the New York Times Bestseller sticker convinced me to try.  I had to wait an extremely long time for a copy of this book at the library and read some other books that I don't care to think back on while I was waiting.  <br />I finally got to read the Mists and found it every bit worth the praise.  Marion Zimmer Bradley, whose thorough details in her other books seemed dull, brought life and feeling into the story of the women behind King Arthur's rule.  They are strong and intriguing and really bring the story to life.  The book is mostly about Morgaine, Morgan le Fay, and portrays her as I like to think, intelligent and independent, and not some evil, crazy witch.  Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere), the other main character, is said to be radiantly beautiful and devoutly Christian, which disturbs her in her decision-making: to love Lancelet (Lancelot) or no, to hate Morgaine or no.  At the beginning of the book, she appeared overly frightened and weak, probably to keep her from rivaling Morgaine's spotlight.  <br />Other women who are in the story are Igraine (for the first hundred or so pages; that was enough because she really annoyed me!  She was so self-contradicting and dumb), Morgause (who they kept saying is evil but she sounded as reasonable as the rest!) Viviane, Elaine, Niniane, and Nimue.  They are all interesting and good in their own way - a bit different than their characters in other Arthurian books, but of course we all have different viewpoints.  I only wish this book didn't get so sexual... Otherwise it was great.  Have patience and read it!
B00003CXRP|3.0|This movie is a perfect example of just how much an actor's contribution can elevate a mediocre story.( which I have to say seemed to be nothing more than a very long Fedex ad at times) Hanks is brilliant which is just as well as he is the only actor on screen for 90 per cent of the movie. While I liked the main theme of the story I was very disappointed by the &quot;post rescue&quot; part of the plot and found it weak and undeveloped. I simply could not accept as plausible the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on &quot;the love of her life&quot; only a year after he disappeared and married someone else. - It actually made me quite angry and the end. The story just tailed off leaving me with a feeling that there was a distinct lack of closure. ( maybe they will make Castaway II...) Anyway, I'm glad I saw it, Hanks' performance was worth it but I woudn't rate it among my all time favorites of his work.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is great: I enjoy the old songs, even the ones done by newer artists. The violin solo sad and beutiful. But the pickingt and singing of Norman Blake and John Hartford are also well done and plesant. Alison Krauss'acapella &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; is a sing-along ong that I play several times a week. <br />This is old-time country and bluegrass at its zenith.
B00004RHZU|4.0|I actually was surprised when I listened to this cd because the look made me think, &quot;Wow, What a weird looking person&quot; Then I listened to it and I was like this is soo cool! Listen to it! I love the song, &quot;Most Girls&quot;
B000000WHX|4.0|There is alot to like about this CD. It is very well put together and is filled with some very good tunes. Very &quot;chilled-out&quot; electronica that seems like an opera sometimes. I highly recommend this one sometimes as well as their other CD, &quot;Protection&quot;.
B00005N83M|5.0|For those of you wondering why Jennifer re-released her album \\"J.Lo\\" with an edited and un-edited version is because this new version features the same songs as the original \\"J.Lo\\" album plus one new song: \\"I'M REAL (MURDA REMIX)\\" Feat. JA RULE. Both the edited and un-edited versions contain the same songs. The only differences from both versions is the cursing in \\"PLAY\\" and \\"I'M REAL (MURDA REMIX)\\", (and possibly the original version of \\"I'M REAL\\")Either way this album is AWESOME, with or without the bonus remix or cusing.

B00003CXN4|2.0|It's nice to see Hollywood tackle a serious issue, and the Drug War is one of the most serious issues there is.<br />Sadly, Traffic offers a distorted view of reality.  Cocaine is presented here as an overwhelming, almost demonic force.  Viewers might never guess that cocaine is actually very similar to alcohol, in that only a minority of users ever become addicts.<br />Worse yet, Traffic seems overtly racist and insulting to Mexicans and African-Americans.  The scene where the black drug dealer in the ghetto dopes up the rich white girl and has sex with her is like something out of Archie Bunker's nightmares.<br />Yet it's all done with a gritty, raw style that is quite accomplished and impressive.  It's too bad this talent serves such mean ends.
B000002JKA|3.0|I typically cringe when people say things like &quot;Yeah, they're really talented musicians but they have no SOUL&quot; or &quot;Being a musician is more than technique, you have to be able to express yourself&quot;. <br />This sort of thing makes me want to puke. Basically, those people just don't get prog music then, because that IS prog musicians expressing themselves, with technical passages, complex compositions, time signature changes, and emotional melodies. Just because they have a wider vocabulary than most other musicians do doesn't mean they're NOT expressing themselves. <br />Unfortunately, for several songs on this albumn, I gotta say: They're isn't any soul here, and some of those comments have merit. Sure, there's technical wizadry all over this album, and the arrangements are complex, time signatures change frequently, and the musicianship is first-rate. Unfortunately the emotional aspect of the music is, for the most part, missing. Memorable melodies? Nada.  <br />This albumn is as bland as a lot of radio stuff, even if it is more diverse technically and the compositions are more complex. There just isn't much &quot;life&quot; to it, which is expecially dissapointing after &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;. <br />Now, that doesn't mean it's a total bust. There is some variety here, and some of the songs express a lot of emotion. I loved Innocense Faded and Lifting Shadows (even if other reviewers bash these)- they complement this mostly guitar-heavy album quite well, and add a level of diversity to the album that I had come to expect after &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;. <br />Unfortunately, the metal/rock influenced songs on this albumn leave a lot to be desired. Many of them are technically great, but they lack emotional content, and that makes it difficult to listen to them after a time. From &quot;6:00&quot; to the 7-string heavy &quot;Lie&quot;, the heavy-handed songs on this albumn just lack something. <br />And then, finally, there is the appease-Kevin's-ego song, &quot;Space Dyed Vest&quot;. It's one of the worst DT songs I've heard, yet it is still ear-catching in some sort of Twilight-zone train-wreck kind of way. The song goes nowhere, does nothing, doesn't impress on a technical level, and completely lacks any sort of emotional attachment. Yet, it still causes me to listen from time to time. <br />Overall, this is the 2nd-most dissapointing DT album I've heard (Falling Into Infinity gets 1st place in the dissapointing catagory). However, bad DT is still better than most other bands (especially radio bands) on their best day. Lifting Shadows, Innocense Faded, &amp; Voices make this worth the money.
B00005B36H|1.0|I bought this monstrosity on the strenghth of an interview in Guitar Player magazine.  This was the guy (Adam Jones) who says &quot; a lot of the stuff I do comes from blues scales&quot;.  Oh yeah, like what?  The never-ending intro to the first song?  Whew, can't believe everything you read I guess.  Finally was able to give away this CD; the guy who has it now is an artist and he wants to shoot it too!
1895565669|5.0|I shared this book with a co-worker one day and was somewhat dismayed at her critical comments about the woman going to her grown son's home to hold him.  I told her I believed it to be written in a literal form so that it could be shared with a young child and that they could understand the more abstract concept of a parents love for their child, that no matter how old they are that their parents love for them does not diminish.  I find that to be one of the most moving messages in this book.  It is one of the first things I think of as a gift for new parents.
0201633612|5.0|Once you've got a few years of experience under your belt you'll find you start having general &quot;favorite&quot; ways of doing things.  Meaning laying out you classes in a particular way.  You'll find that giving these things a name and looking at others' named &quot;patterns&quot; is a heck of a good way to write software and communicate ideas to others.<br />This book was kind of the first and kind of the best on the subject.  So important its often referred to as the &quot;GOF&quot; (gang of four) or &quot;blue and white&quot; book.  It uses C++ to illustrate its points but any oop-familiar person should be able to read it just fine.  Its well written and avoids much of that high-browed abstract achedmenic language that most design books use.  (often at the expense of both clarity and correct use of language).<br />You'd be ill-advised to ignore this book.  The ideas within it have prevailed already.
B000003N7K|5.0|The story behind this album, that it was all recorded in a single afternoon of work, is remarkable. The quality of sound, especially given the state of the art at the time of the recording, is incredible. And this is two masters at the top of their game. Added together, this may be the very best song album you'll ever buy.<br />Not to be crass, but it's incredibly sexy music for a hot summer afternoon or a rainy fall evening. Enjoy!
B000000LZV|5.0|I would say double nickles is the best double record ever recorded.  I am not really a big fan of the superlative, but this record really is too much.  To think that it is compared to Zen Arcade by Husker Du is a bit of a joke.  While I do like Zen Arcade a whole bunch, it really cannot hold a candle to DNOTD.  It is very interesting that they are both released on SST, in the same year, but Zen is wholly uneven (likely would have been a VERY powerful single record), vascillating between great and mediocre, whereas DNOTD barely steps down from excellence.  That is a pretty amazing feat for a 45 song record.  It is also amazing to think of how young the musicians were when they did this.  Truly a record to be proud of, and one of the relatively few records of its genre that will still be listened to in 50 or more years (that is if we smarten up and are still actually here ouselves!)
B00003CXMG|5.0|The Academy must have been sleeping or dead or... I don't know when viewing this movie. Not only should it have been nominated for best picture it hands down should have won over the likes of Gladiator. Gladiator, while an okay movie, is not even on the same plantet as this masterpiece. Even if you don't like rock n' roll, it doesn't matter, it's more about the characters and their struggles. All the actors are perfect especially newcomer Fugit. Hudson should have won best supporting actress for her portrayal of Penny Lane, one of the best and most interesting characters since Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday. The atmosphere is also one of the things that grabs you. Everything is so perfect to the last minute detail. I can go on and on about how good this movie is but that would just waste time for you to go pick up this DVD. Speaking of the DVD, it is very well done. You won't see a picture much nicer than this one. The sound is what you expect. The only movies in 2000 that came close to being best picture are Traffic and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
0156012197|5.0|What a great book! Very quick reading, and yet very meaningful at the same time. If you take it in the right way, it can change your life!
067144901X|5.0|This children's book is filled with many creative learning opportunities.  Sandra Boynton uses creative word play and rhyme to capture even the youngest child's imagination.  The illustrations are captivating and successfully retain my infants interest.  We received this book as a gift and began reading it to our 3 month old.  Within one month he began &quot;reading&quot; it all the time and it has become his favorite.  A great pick for even young babies.
0679735259|4.0|A tour guide through a seductive hell, Michael Herr describes his Vietnam, a place equally nightmarish and exhilerating. Helicopters are ubiquitous, the style and organization often surreal. Herr leaves you with burning images of a colonel who will pound the enemy with meat, Hendrix blaring out of a transistor radio in a rice paddy, or (worst of all) ponchos that fail to conceal the dead like body bags do.  Their humanity restored, the grunts speak volumes in clipped phrases.  In the end you wonder what happened to the flamboyant Sean Flynn (inspiration for the Clash song on &quot;Combat Rock&quot;). Or what that soldier returning from Hill 875 said to the fat girl in the Peanuts sweatshirt to make her cry. If you count yourself among those who have what Joseph Conrad termed &quot;a fascination with the abomination,&quot; this book will blow you away. It's an astonishing read.
0446605409|5.0|Nelson DeMille introduces the main character of John Corey in Plum Island, who is later used in The Lion's Game.  John is witty, sarcastic, and chauvenistic, which you either love or hate.  Personally, I got a kick out of following John through his investigation and pursuit of the bad guys, and thought that John's flaws kept a good human quality to the book when so many books have a nearly flawless main character.<br />A good read, which DeMille improves upon in The Lion's Game.
B00005A1PR|4.0|Even if only for the song &quot;Video,&quot; which I have adopted as my personal theme song!  India Arie possess a unique gift and I applaud her talents!  The only thing that kept me from giving her 5 stars is that some of the tracks start to sound alike after a while.  Overall, though, it's an excellent CD!
0064471047|5.0|I never read this as a child. I had no idea what I was missing until I read this story several months ago. Better late than never. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with my grandchildren. From an adult's perspective the symbolism is profound. I'm so glad I took the time to read this classic. I look forward to reading the other tales of Narnia.
B00004Y6NM|3.0|This album is OK. Musically it's not that bad but I have always been bothered by this one question I have with it.  For an artist who is for the most part an accomplished guitarist, why are the drums more forefront than the other instruments? Including the guitar!<br />Instead of a &quot;Original Recording Remaster&quot; who about a re-mix with the drums pulled back some?
0671027344|5.0|the cover says MTV on it.  i know, this is very frigthening and would prevent me from buying a book, without a doubt.  however when i originally got this one it was borrowed and i never did read the back so i never saw the spine.  i just read.  and read.  and read.  5, 6 hours later, i was done.  merely 213 pages.  but one fascinating and captivating piece of literature.<br />charlie, the main character, is writing to someone whose name you can almost guess, you can almost feel who this person is, but you never find out, never know.  charlie is extremely naive, to the point that everyday profanity, common to all teenagers, he puts in quotation marks as though it was some foreign word that he didn't expect you to have heard before or know the meaning of.  charlie's ignorance is vital to the novel; he is in no way jaded to the world, and not touched by stereotype, thus he can deliver the truth as it really is.  for instance, he finds it coincidental that his friend Bob does an excessive amount of pot, and that Bob 1) really likes twinkies, 2) knows a myriad of trivia about Mary Tyler Moore and other old sitcoms, 3) has a strong belief in karma, 4) tends to say the same things over and over and over and over.  to me, this fits the pothead stereotype to a T, but to charlie, it is very funny and quirky.<br />the characters all reflect different aspects of the numerous themes.  one clear theme is how much we are affected by what happens to us when we are young, how our parents shape who we are.  beatings and molestations are a running theme in the book.  Bob's parents left him alone a lot as a child.  as a result, he turned to drugs for company, and is wasting away his life smoking out and going to community college.  beatings from a stepfather wrecked charlie's mother as well as his father.  they destroyed his aunt helen.<br />another important theme in the book is how one can't just let life pass him or her by, that you have to participate.  this somewhat runs parallelto the theme of Catcher in the Rye; that you can't go backwards, only forwards.  in this novel, the theme is incarnated in charlie, who likes to watch the world pass him by, without stepping in; he prefers to be a &quot;shoulder.&quot;  chbosky tells readers that you can't do this in life; you have to go out and live it, make a difference, don't just stand there, somebody may need you!!  anyway, sorry, got a little off track there.<br />anyway, one cannot ignore the countless parallels to catcher in the rye, including that charlie is slowly losing his mind, that he is passive-aggressive (REALLY agressive; enough so that the self described &quot;wimp&quot; could beat up 5 members of the football team at one time), that he prefers to run from his problems, and watch other people without getting involved and critique them, and more specific things, for instance, a teacher who seems a little too much like Mr. Antolini, the suicide of a friend who it is not exactly clear whether charlie is very close to or not, and, well, some other huge ones but i'd be giving away the best parts of the story if i told them to you.  this book is more like a rip-off than a tribute, but i will let that go because chbosky knows that (his main character reads Catcher in the Rye several times during the story).<br />to fans of this book, i recommend the novel Youth in Revolt by CD Payne, which is a completely different spin on Catcher.  if you have not read Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, you should read that as well, and one should definitely read it BEFORE reading this novel if given the choice.  i also recommend, to those who enjoyed this book or either of my recommendations, the album &quot;Pinkerton&quot; by Weezer.<br />Sorry for the essay of a review!!  I had a minute.  By the way, the book is very good.  :-)
B000059R8Y|2.0|Almost everything on this album mirrors something he has put out since 1989's 'Jouneryman'. Light acoustic, some blues, r&amp;b a little rock. Echos of his 70's output resound here. I suppose the addition of the Impressions can be considered new. <br />I have been a fan of Clapton for nearly twenty years now. And one thing that he has consistantly said about when people want to hear him plug in a Les Paul and crank the amps ala the Cream days, his response is &quot;I've done that already.&quot;  Well Mr Clapton, you've done the acoustic, r&amp;b, easy listening rock before also, yet you still put it out (as evidenced by this album).  If you consider yourself largely a blues guitarist, then lets stick with that.

0393038912|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it gave me another perspective on why the world is the way it is. I've always wondered why the Western civilizations flourished, while many of the tribal societies, like those of the Americas, Africa and Austraila were defeated by Westerners. Were these people inately inferior, or did their environment have something to do with their defeat? <br />Guns, Germs, and Steel takes the position that you do not NECESSARILY have to conclude that these people are inferior because they are defeated people. The book attempts to explain how these tribal societies' environments could account for why these people were defeated by Westerners.<br />Despite the popular MISCONCEPTION of this book, the author does not pretend that he is presenting an iron-clad case that these people's environment HAD to have been the cause for their defeat. Like any rational scientist, he doesn't conclude that these people WEREN'T innately inferior (biologically, for example) in some way. No, he does no such thing. What he is doing is answering this question right here:<br />If these tribal societies didn't contain inferior humans (inferior in some sort of biological, innate way), then how do you account for their &quot;backwards societies&quot; and their constant defeat by Westerners.<br />The book concludes that there is enough information about these groups environments to make the case that these people didn't NECESSARILY have to be inferior peoples just because they were defeated.  This is a subtle point that too many people missed. So in other words, according to the conclusions of this book, it would be a weak argument to conclude that these people of tribal societies HAD to be inferior because they were defeated people, and because they didn't advance in the similar way that WEstern society advanced.<br />Oh, and unlike what the reviewer below said, the authoer NEVER said anything about the New Guini people being superior to Westerners, or for anyone for that matter. What he did do, in one little paragraph in the book, was use the commonly used argument for why these people HAD to be inferior, and show how it could be turned around for why these people HAD to be superior. He wasn't writing out an argument for why these aborignals were smarter, but instead, using the method of showing how you can lead to two contradictory conclusions using the same argument. And what was that argument? It was just the basic &quot;commen-sense&quot; approach to looking at the world, instead of the rational and empirical based approach of science. The author most likely used this little example to show why empiricism and rational thought are better methods for discovering truths than using your superficial &quot;common-sense&quot; analysis, since in this example, the &quot;common-sense&quot; analysis&quot; lead to contradictory conclusions. <br />It amazes me how people have painted this book into a left/right category. It isn't a political book. Those that call it PC or liberal propaganda are those that tend to not be interested in finding the truth about the world around them, but instead, only interested in finding evidence to back up their own personal ideologies. Well, guys, sometimes, the world doesn't act like you want it to. Just because a book's conclusions may be well accepted in today's PC climate (which I admit, we are living in a society that has an excess amount of political correctnes), and this conclusion being that the non-Westerners aren't NECESSARILY biologically inferior to Westerners, doesn't mean that it is biased in anyway.<br />Only the weak and shallowed minded people would conclude that because a liberal may like this book, or because its message would be one that would not be attacked by the PC elite, that this book must therefore be biased and corrupted in someway.<br />Oh, and by the way, since when did it mean you are liberal, or brainwashed by political correctness if you happen to believe that all men were createdequal?
0060934913|5.0|Those without the stomach for this kind of true story should be warned that there will be restaurant horror stories that involve heavy drinking, drugs, sex in the dry-goods area, unappetizing and appalling industry-wide practices from some of the best-rated hotels and restaurants. <br />The book tells you why you probably shouldn't order fish on a Monday, why those who favor well done steaks and burgers get the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel, and why seafood frittata is not such a wise Sunday brunch selection. This book reveals what goes on behind the kitchen doors while you&#8217;re \\"enjoying\\" your meal. From the restaurants of Tokyo to the drug dealers of the East Village, from the mobsters to the rats, wild-but-true tales make the belly ache with both laughter and sadness. This book makes you pick up a good cookbook and cook at home...
0060168366|5.0|Writing a history of America today is an arduous and thankless task given the plethora of cultures and backgrounds that demand &quot;equal time.&quot; Johnson's volume is an excellent overview of the diversity of a great land. Highly recommended.
0446310786|5.0|Ok, I had to read this book for my school.Most of the time I get bored with the books I read in school. But when I started reading this, I was really amazed it turned out to be a good book. This is the best book I ever read for school. I just love it :) If anyone is reading this, please go get the book. It's worth it.
006092988X|5.0|Prima!  As in Prima Donna, of course.  (Read the book to understand that reference)  This book covers the entire emotional spectrum for both characters and readers.  I read it looking for a simple story, but when I was asked what it was about, I couldn't find simple words for it, though the hours spent reading it flew by.  I wish this beautiful story hadn't ended.  This book should be read under a tree with mountains in the background to complete it's Romantic and Realist era finesse.
6302610702|5.0|I can sit and watch this all the time.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I would recommend this to anyone that is into drama, family, and understands the values of life. I was never interested until I watch the entire collection. I fell in love with the movie.  If you don't purchase you have to rent.

0062502182|4.0|Though there was tidbits of wisdom woven throughout the first part of this book, and the story was interesting, it was hard for me to get into this book until it was about three-fourths over.  In fact I picked it up and put it down for months before I finished it.  The last quarter of the book, however, made it all worthwhile.  The reminders of this life were simple but so importan. Because, perhaps they are such simple truths, we tend to forget them.  This book reminded me how important, special, and wondorous, everyone and everything is.

B00004SA8A|5.0|All of Schubert's piano sonatas, fragments, and the completed masterworks, together in a neat box; 7 discs worth of pure listening pleasure, allowing one to see how the composer grappled with the keyboard sonata form, and along the way created several masterpieces of the genre. Kempff recorded these works over a period of several years, and whilst the recorded sound quality varies from good to excellent, the quality of interpretation is uniformly high to my ear. This is gorgeous playing, evocatively capturing the shifting moods of this often elusive composer. Are these the greatest of interpretations? Perhaps..perhaps not. Either way, in an increasingly crowded market of recordings, this set has to be highly recommended for many reasons, not the least of which is the utter committment of Kempff to this music and the manner in which he convinces us, the listeners, of the 'rightness' of his choices. Oh, and need I mention again that ALL the sonatas are here, in one very beautifully priced box set
B000002MNL|5.0|This is Morrissey in a kind-of unprecedented light. I mean, the album is so gloomy the way I love Morrissey and at the same time full of life and happyness. I LOVE Speedway and Why Don't U Find Out For Yourself. This is a wonderful album, buy it!
B000005H7D|5.0|&quot;Blue Train&quot;, the legendary lone Blue Note session, is Trane's finest mainstream performance. This session, featuring Trane, Lee Morgan, Kenny Drew, Curtis Fuller and Philly Joe Jones ABSOLUTELY SMOKES. It manages to offer two marvelous things: the classic Blue Note &quot;sound&quot;, as well as hints of Coltrane's evolving genius. It is worth owning simply for the alternate take of &quot;Blue Train&quot;.
B00003CXB6|3.0|It wasn't hard to accept the Site-b story, the things that are negative about this movie is the little girl doing gymnastics to beat a raptor, Julianne Moore's stunt double during the raptor scenes knowing exactly what to do and where to go and the Rexzilla part but the rest of the movie ain't that bad, if only they had cut those scenes out it would have been a lot better. Still, it's much better that JP3.
6302909651|2.0|There's very little interest to be derived out of this voyeuristic, uncomfortable thriller. Almost every &quot;suspenseful&quot; moment is telegrammed and formulaic, the characters are hopelessly muddled, there are far too many illogicalities, and apparently Esterhaz threw in touches of dark humor that don't come off. Well let me explain the latter: the &quot;panties&quot; scene at the restaurant, the part where Stone and a bunch of friends at a formal gettogether at her apartment look through a telescope and see a couple having sex, and how naive Sharon is to the tempting William. I'm not sure if this was thrown in as comic relief or it's what AMAZON is talking about when they say it's unintentionally funny. The ending is particularly unsatisfying. This one is strictly for Stone fans.
B000002UAX|1.0|This would have made a great single album, if the Beatles had been able to control themselves. Instead it is one of the worst self-indulgent albums of all time. How can anyone thing that junk such as Revolution #9, Piggies or Honey Pie are great? I believe that people only think it is great because it's the Beatles, the infallible group. Half of what the Beatles recorded is truly great or near-great but the other half just stinks and The White Album represents the worst of the worst.If you want a good album combine the best tracks on one disc. If you want a great album buy Begger's Banquet or John Wesley Harding
080013558X|4.0|Ok, so the first thing we look at is the fact that this is technically not the real storyline for the musical Annie. But the second thing we look at is that kids will enjoy this version more, I know I like it better than any of the other movies, but the musical is still the best thing, if only they had the obc doing a performance on vhs, then that would be the thing to get. None the less, I love the musical Annie, and this is what got me started, it takes away from the real setting(eg: the real thing was during christmas, not the 4th of july, and some songs are missing and some were replaced) but it is still a great way to start kids into a love for musicals.
0425180638|4.0|I read several of the reviews and did not understand the hostility.  I for one loved the book.  The characters are all there, something I find troubling in other series.  I like to know that when I pick up a book, all my friends will be there.  If you enjoy the Scarpetta series of work and Patricia Cornwell, you will not be diappointed.
B00005B6C9|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  I have played it and played it.  Several of my co-workers have went out and bought it.  I would love to hear some of these songs on the radio but it's as though the DJ's are deaf to the Bee Gees songs (except for the old ones).  I know they have to have these CD's to play from.  When you call and request it they say they will play some but you never hear them. I just think they have been treated unfairly and not given a chance like the other artists you hear on the radio.  They play the same ones over and over and over again. Why can't they play some of the newer ones from these latest CD's of the Bee Gees?  I think we should somehow protest all the radio stations in our area.  If you are a true Bee Gee fan you will love this CD.  Not a song on there that I don't like.  Again, they have outdid themselves.  Keep it going guys. We love you.  you
B00003CXFG|4.0|Without repeating much of what has been said by the hundreds of other reviewers, I will comment on what attracted me to the film.  Atmosphere, and moral ambiguity.  What I mean is the sense of melancholy and dread that comes through strongly not only in the decent acting but moreso in the great audiovisuals (the lighting used during the movie's daylight-on-planet episode really set the tone).  I thought the special effects were great, especially for being low budget, though it is my constant opinion that 8 out of 10 movies with huge special effects budgets are thin on everything else.  Another reader cited &quot;the mummy&quot;.  Ugg what a terrible movie.  Anyway, add a somber new-age synth score that, while watching I felt myself transplanted there doomed with the rest of the characters.<br />As to my second point, the main characters all had major flaws while still showing their humanity.  The minor characters, however, were woefully described paper thin, despite having decent actors fill those thin roles.  They could have done so much more...<br />With an opening scene that immediately thrusts the heroine into a morally decisive situation that doesnt result in typical hollywood fashion, you can see what I mean by &quot;moral ambiguity&quot;.<br />Radha mitchell and Vin Diesel, as well as the fellow who plays the hypo-merc Johns pour out the cheesy drama, and it works.<br />However, as the movie progresses into action and more action, it loses its initial charm, and reduces to more typical formula fare.
6305226296|5.0|This video was excellent.  The sound, the music and the complete show was fantastic.  The Brothers Gibb still have it and I think they have shown that for the past several years.  It's a crying shame they have to tour to promote their songs!  Very few radio stations are playing their music.  I have watched this video over and over and it is great.  Go out and buy yourself one.  You won't regret it.
6305313687|5.0|It was really a crime that this movie did not win any Oscars! How Edward Norton didn't win for best actor has to be the biggest [let-down] of all time! It's amazing that truly great acting does not get rewarded at the Oscars (nothing but politics)! There is no way that you could watch this movie and not feel for the main character. When you see how Ed Norton's character grew up and how Cameron influenced him, it just makes you sick that there are individuals like Cameron walking around influencing kids today. The great thing about this film is what happens when Ed Norton goes to Jail and realizes that everything he believed in was all [wrong]! The way he try&#8217;s to save his little brother, by telling him what happen to him in jail is very moving. The movie does have its violent times; I even had to turn away with the curb scene. If you are looking for a very moving picture to watch look no further. Everyone that I have told to watch this film has had nothing but good things to say about it! I know if you watch it you will feel that way to.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I bought the Snatch DVD without knowing what to expect. I had read mixed reviews for it, so I was a little concerned that I wouldn't enjoy it. But my worries were all for nothing. Snatch is an incredible movie. A great plot, amazing characters, and spectacular performances make this one of the best films I've ever seen. Brad Pitt, Rade Sherbadgia, Jason Statham, and Alan Ford give the four best performances as the almost intelligible gypsy bare knuckle boxer Mickey, the crooked Russian gun salesman Boris the Blade, boxing promoter Turkish, and ruthless gangster Brick Top, respectively. And the characters of Vinny, Sol, and Tyrone (the actors names fail me at the moment) will have you laughing constantly. The DVD has some pretty good special features, including some sweet deleted scenes. If you're a fan of cinema in general, buy Snatch. You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXN4|1.0|I was expecting a masterpiece with all hype about Traffic. When I rented the DVD I realized I can't truse the general public. The whole plot taking place in America was very missleading and innacurate. What was depicted is not a good representation of American youths who are involved in the drug scene. It's on the borderline of a modern day Reefer Madness. I felt like I was watching a long, badly edited evening news. I would have been much happier just watching the Mexico plotline.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Computer simulation used in this movie is great, the story is very interesting and the director did one good job !

B00005BJPO|5.0|First of all, I'm not impressed with the restoration of this film. On the bonus disc, they show how they went through the movie and took &quot;dirt&quot; spots off the film. After I watched the movie I saw these dirt spots EVERYWHERE! I saw no improvement from the VHS. The colors were bright and pretty as they should be. The sound is perfect. The voices are so so. They rerecorded the voices to better match the original script. But I liked the first voices better even though most people didn't. I don't know...I guess I have watch the first version of Akira so many times the voices grew on me. They even pronounced the names differently from the first version. Kaneda's name sounds more like &quot;Canada&quot; in this version. But I guess that's how it was pronounced in the Japanese version. I'm sure these new voices will have grown on me after the 500th time I've watched this DVD. That's about how many times I've watch the VHS. Which is why I needed the DVD. I watched the VHS so many times it's no good anymore. That's how good this movie is. Not only is it my favorite anime but my favorite movie period. Movies don't get any better than this.
B000020617|5.0|Albums like these don't come along too often.  You know, those albums that flow from beginning to end, with every single note in perfect proportion.  That is how I feel about &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; by the Foo Fighters.  Makes me think of Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; album, in that respect.<br />This album was my first attempt in listening to a Foo Fighters record.  I was so blown away by this album, that I went out and got pretty much everything they've ever done.<br />My favorite tracks from TINLTL include, &quot;Gimme Stitches&quot;, &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Next Year&quot;, &quot;Ain't it the Life&quot;, and &quot;M.I.A&quot;  Throw in the radio friendly &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot; and you have a smash album.  I still get goosebumps from time to time when I listen to this album, as it is touching, and almost guarantees to put me in a peaceful mood. I am greatly anticipating further work from Foo.  Excellent job!
B0000508U6|4.0|This album grows on you. Of course, most people are familiar with the simple, moving tunes of &quot;Yellow&quot; and admittedly, that was the song that got me interested in the album, but the entire album is simply put: quality music.  Rather than give a song by song analysis, I feel I ought to say that the lyrics to the songs are broadly metaphorical, yet simple to understand the author's intent. The lyrics are backed up wonderfully by crisp yet smooth, original music. Influences, at least on this album, actually appear to be primarily The Smiths and a bit of The Cure.  The music will grow on you, and you will find yourself picking this album out of your rack quite often. Besides that, &quot;Yellow&quot; is by far the most moving love song since Peter Gabriel's &quot;In Your Eyes.&quot;
0790729369|4.0|If you don't know the story - Streep plays a lonely Iowa farm housewife who accidentally meets Clintwood, a photographer from National Geographic shooting pictures of bridges.  They flirt, they picnic, they have fun, they have an affair.  It's a fairly good adaption of the novel.  Be forewarned that the story is told through flashbacks from Streeps two adult children after she passes away and they find her 'letters'.  The storyline works, but when these two actors jump in, it's like amateur time.  Who ARE these two actors?  Leave it to our veteran actors to polish an already good story.  A great mood piece and one to put romance and perspective back into your life.
B00005MAM2|5.0|THE MASTERPIECE RETURNS! This DVD set is really a master work, a piece of art, it's really the cutting edge of Anime around the world. You won't believe the quantity of special features included; it was restored,Remastered with THX sound, the image quality was digitally remastered too, the added image gallery with tons of pictures and original trailers and tv spots. There is so much stuff in this set, they had to put it on 2 DVDs. This is really a must have for anybody who loves Anime and japanese animation. And if you are a real Collector, get your hand on the Limited Edition Metal Collector's Case.
0061020710|3.0|It's a great book alright. Although not the best one to start the series off (Will probably give a bad impression to newcomers) it's still a pretty decent book. The laughs aren't Laugh-out-loud stuff and they really don't come as often. The characters are as original as the world itself, but there's none of the MAGIC that pratchett writes that can be seen as soon it's sequel, The Light Fantastic. In this book, the characters wander aimlessly through the world, without much MAJOR objective in mind.<br />Is it worth your time and money? Yes. But don't think the entire series stays like this (it improves a lot!)<br />After reading this book, I wasn't really encouraged to buy it's sequels. If I hadn't read on the internet that it gets a LOT better, I would've never had. Thank God for the internet
B000002UYZ|2.0|Many of the other reviewers have commented on the shamefully short running time, so I won't focus much on that. I just want to note that I have many single discs in my collection with 30 songs and nearly eighty minutes of music. This takes two discs to present 26 songs topping out at 66 minutes.<br />There are other flaws as well. It'd be nice if there were liner notes and remastered sound. The song selection is haphazard at best. There's no &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; (in my opinion the group's greatest rockers), &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot;, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; or &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot; all huge hits recorded during the era. (Though the latter would not reach the top ten until 1976 three years after this was originally compiled.) Also many primo album tracks like &quot;Money&quot; are not here. And for collectors there's not a single rarity in sight.<br />The material that is here is pretty choice though. There may be a toss off clunker or two like &quot;Michelle&quot; or &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (which are still half decent) but the majority of what's here is some of the finest and most influential rock and roll ever recorded capturing the spirit of early rock and hinting towards greater sophistication (if not better music). Still, though a novice would be better off with &quot;Beatles One&quot; or even diving straight into the original lps that except for the last are all essential listening. It should be mentioned though that not even these have been remastered or compiled with any real scholarship. It's a shame because with the splendid recent upgrades of the Beach Boys' and Ricky Nelson catalogues, Capitol really showed that they know how reissues should be done. If only the Beatles were accorded the same treatment.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|Having not seen the American remake of this series, my partner and I sat down to watch this British series on DVD and quickly became hooked--not by the sex (which got so much publicity), but by the overall quality of the production--especially its writing and acting. We cared about these characters and their families (warts and all), and were disappointed when the first 4 hours were over. We're middle-aged urban Americans, but we identified very much with the universality of this younger British milieu--some things transcend time and place. It's inspiring to see gay themes treated on the screen with such intelligence, wit and maturity. We've come a long way. No lectures here. No moralizing. No black &amp; white heroes and villians. Just some real, complicated, flawed but loveable characters struggling with how to be happy and proud in an imperfect world.     We wish the DVD made better use of providing additional materials; more background on the actors, writers and such would have been appreciated.     We bought the 90-minute, Part 2 conclusion as soon as it was available, and found it to be be inferior to the original series and an unsatisfying conclusion to the saga--but any opportunity to spend more time with these characters was appreciated.     This is one of those rare series that I'm sure we'll watch again periodically.
B000002U82|5.0|All that you touch...All that you see... Is all that your life will ever be...
630218021X|5.0|An average rating of just 3 stars for Ken Russell's cinematic masterpiece? Scandalous! From beginning to end, this film is an extravaganza of visual delights and narrative verve, as rich and dramatic as Tchaikovsky's music. Every performance is effective, Melvyn Bragg's screenplay is pacy, intelligent and witty. The Music Lovers is quite simply a tour de force, a must-see movie. [....]
B00003CXSP|4.0|From the first moment of the opening credits I knew that this was a different angle on the &quot;Lecter-Starling show&quot;. Classy, arty titles and a very chic overall feel contrasted with the SoTL opening sequences which are almost home movie by comparison. However therein lies the problem. The gloss of &quot;Hannibal&quot; removes us to a distance from the characters, and where SoTL was visceral, sweaty, and real, Hannibal is almost voyeuristic by comparison, somewhat uninvolving.<br />It was only my familiarity and, yes, fondness for the characters which drew me in and it was only my active interest in developments which kept me working at watching the film, and compared to SoTL, there was some work involved.<br />Where the book fleshed out Lecter, free in his own world of culture and experiences for the refined mind, the film touches the same ideas, but without the literary backup offering insights into Lecter's thoughts and views on the world around him, we can only watch the character, and, superb though Hopkins' acting is, there is almost inevitably a loss of contact with the character of Lecter.<br />The scene shift from the opening FBI stakeout in the bleached concrete wilderness of the US location, to the sumptuous vistas of Florence bathed in golden light serves to emphasise the gulf between Lecter's and Starling's worlds, and the killer with refined tastes lives well while the good-intentioned Starling suffers under the media spotlight. Having emphasised this aspect so well, the film then falters in its mission to bring these two diametric opposites together, achieved so well in the book.<br />The book strains credibility to a massive degree, but has the cohesiveness and plausibility to allow us to become involved and to believe, for a while, what we're being told (sci-fi does this all the time, but then we're way out of the &quot;normal world&quot;, whatever that might be). However Hannibal- The Film, because it is less closely involved and somewhat voyeuristic, and meant to be set in the world of today, not tomorrow, keeps us at a distance, keeps us questioning just how plausible the whole thing is.<br />So, I suppose I don't like the film then ... but I do. Bereft of the smaller details (Barney's role for example, more extensive in the book) it certainly seems shallow, but in terms of cinematic effect it works well on the big screen. Quite how it will come across on DVD I don't know.<br />The high spots for me were the scene at the opera (with Lecter effectively stalking Pazzi), for the music (Vide Cor Meum on the soundtrack CD) which is a moment of sublime beauty around a killer on the loose, and the Florence location in general. In fact Florence was one of the stars of the film (who's she?!).

B00004X01U|3.0|Madonna is the queen of pop, so everything she does is O.K. But I think her 1998s album &quot;ray of light&quot; was better than 2000s &quot;music&quot;. From her last album I just like &quot;dont tell me&quot; and &quot;music&quot;;the other songs dont have any special sound. Anyway, you can buy this CD if you are a great fan like me.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Easily the best soundtrack ever. Makes me wonder if they made the movie after the music -- that is how tight it is.  This soundtrack is perfect for writing, relaxing, dreaming or as background music, although it may start to freak any possible guests out. This is an absolutely haunting experience, which to me is a sign of great art.
0425166805|2.0|Like Sitchin, Von Daniken does a great service to the academic and archeolgical fields by simply assembling wonderful collections of &quot;ancient mysteries,&quot; which are quite worthy of investigation. But both also leap to the conclusion that the only possible explanation &quot;must be&quot; extra-terrstrial visitors. However, there is now a great body of work about the &quot;Sons of God&quot; and the Nephilim of Genesis 6 which affirm the biblical statements that angels (not ET's) co-habitated with &quot;Earth girls&quot; to produce superhuman hybrids - who were &quot;the heroes of old, men of reknown&quot; (Gen 6:4). Chariots of the Gods cannot be ignored by thinking people as the collection of information is astounding, but the extra-terrestrial hypothesis is actually much harder to show evidence for than the angelic interpretation (which is affirmed and retold by almost every major religion and ancient culture). Read COTG to get a grip on where people wind up when they eliminate a Biblical worldview from history, but compare Von Daniken's conclusions with what is said in books like The Book of Enoch, Nephilim (Marzulli), Alien Encounters (Missler), The Facade (Heiser) and Earth's Earliest Ages (Pember).

B00003W8NM|5.0|The title led me to believe this was going to be another brainless movie aimed at violence-loving teenage boys.  <br />How wrong could i have been.  On the surface there is indeed a great deal of physical violence, but look below and there is a great deal more to discover.  <br />One thing that struck me (no pun intended) and which has continued to stay with me, is that to properly understand and appreciate this film, i believe one has to have read the Unabomber's manifesto (found easily on the net).   The similarities are striking.<br />If you haven't read it, download and read it, and then watch the movie again.  You'll see it in a different light.

B00003CY5K|4.0|Reece Witherspoon finds herself carrying a major release feature film for the first time, and rises to the challenge. Legally Blonde is a crisp and energetic comedy that refuses to be taken seriously, even during its most pivotal courtroom scenes. The subtle and smart screenplay, adapted from Amanda Brown's novel, nonetheless falls into mediocrity for long stretches, the plot is somewhat half-baked, and the characters are archetypal at best. Yet somehow, I was genuinely entertained.<br />Witherspoon triumphed as a troubled teen with a razor sharp edge in \\"Freeway\\" (1996) and as an annoying and ruthless over-achiever in \\"Election\\" (1999). In each of her roles, her intelligence and capability smolder under a Barbie-doll exterior. Her characters put us on edge. One moment we're haughtily amused, the next, hopelessly intimidated. It's the type of feeling we got watching Sharon Stone in her prime. Expect more of the same from Witherspoon in this upbeat vehicle.<br />As she pursues her ex (Matthew Davis II) to Harvard Law, men and women alike hastily underestimate Elle (Witherspoon)-a Sorority president and Fashion Merchandizing major from Beverly Hills. Each faces the consequences as Elle repeatedly tramples the mythology of the ineffectual Blonde, all the time remaining impeccably dressed and manicured.<br />Myself a graduate student at Harvard, I must admit I enjoyed Brown's jabs at the mentality of many Ivy Leaguers. But this film is mostly worth seeing for its down-to-earth common sense, for its unbelievable comedic situations (one character is outed by his knowledge of shoe designers), and of course, for Reece.

Solid Clancy -- worth every minute I spent reading it.

B000000OQ5|5.0|1987...a year when Bon Jovi was still living large off of their breakout &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; album.  Van Halen was a year into a very successful start with a new lead singer named Sammy Hagar.  Bands named Whitesnake, Def Leppard, and Great White would all release masterful hard rock albums.  But standing right at the top of this list was this debut from Tesla.  While it may not have garnered the pop chart success most of the aformentioned albums did, it was truly in a class of its own.  All this band cared about was THE MUSIC.  No &quot;glam&quot; gimmicks--just some of the most amazing hard rock you could ever hope to hear.  Nearly every track is a standout.  Besides the great radio tracks--including the rocking first release &quot;Modern Day Cowboy&quot;, the near-top 40 catchy diddy &quot;Little Suzi&quot;, and the sweetly reminiscing anthem &quot;Changes&quot;--such rockers as &quot;Comin' Attcha Live&quot; and &quot;2 Late 4 Love&quot; and slower tracks like &quot;We're No Good Together&quot; and the anthemic &quot;Love Me&quot; are favorites.  I could rave about each and every track on this album; that's how good it is.  One of the best bands from my favorite era of rock music.
B00004STPT|5.0|This score is my personal favorite for many reasons.  One of them, and probably the main reason is the feel of the music.  Zimmer's team with Djivon Gasparyan and Heitor Pereira make the music alive.  This was the first time I heard an Armenian instrument, and I liked the feel as well. Another reason is the course the score takes.  I'll describe it as &quot;... A battle and a jouney in a strange land&quot; (Emperor Marcus Aurelius).  This is great music and I would strongly recommened this to any fan of Hans Zimmer and of wonderful music.
0201626632|4.0|This short book gives a lot of advices that should be carefully considered for all budding scientists.  Of course, if you are a tenured university professor, this might not be the book for you -- but it might be valuable to your students.  <br />My current academic status is a graduate student in biophysics.  I am a weighing my options of either going to industry or academia after graduation.  This book has given me a lot of worthwhile suggestions.  There are certainly some factors that I haven't even considered until I read this book.  The book also taught me a lot of 'survival skills' that I should start practicing.  <br />I believe that a lot of my peers are going through graduate school with ignorance on skills that are not directly related to physics, such as presentation skills, publishing and writing skills, and communication skills.  These are probably more important in finding a secure job than a high IQ brain. <br />One of the main goal of this book is to help us consider the ingredients needed for a secure and stable scientific career.  I believe this will save some of us a lot of headaches in the future.  <br />For negatives, I believe that the author tries to assume that we (the audience) are all high caliber students and postdocs.  I definitely don't consider myself someone who will make any major contribution to science, or being capable of publishing 1 paper every year or so.  I don't know if I can even produce 1 publication within my entire graduate career.  Furthermore, I really wish there were more in-depth discussion on finding the right mentor in the academic and industrial world.  Despite the cons, I still think this book should be read by all serious researchers.
B00003XAVA|4.0|Would you be happy with three or four good songs, five or six forgettable ones, and one that's off the scale? Then consider buying this album.<br />Among the good songs are Carry Me, Bittersweet,  Love Work Out, and maybe Take the Money and Run. <br />The title song, however, is miles beyond the rest of the album. It's hard to even think of anything CSN&amp;Y did that compares with it. Somehow they have risen above themselves to produce a beautiful yet  tragic piece (it doesn't feel right to call it a &quot;song&quot;) which juxtaposes the beauty and freedom of being a whale with the tragedy of their slaughter. I can't listen to it without tears. Without this song the CD would deserve 2.5 or maybe 3 stars. With it, it's a four-star CD. I would have been happy if it had nothing but the title song.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is undoubtubly the best rap album and compliation of songs i have ever heard. With hits such as 'What's the difference', 'forgot about Dre' and artists featuring such as Eminem, Snoop and Nate Dogg, Xzibit and some funny 'skit' tracks, such as Ed-ucation. The lyrics and beats just blow you over and you would not expect anything less from Dr. Dre.
0805210393|2.0|This book is as disturbing as it is boring:  hundreds of pages of episodes in which the reader is unsure of what is really going on, all with a vivid and depressing dream-like atmosphere and acute anxiety.  The characters seem as caught in the strange bureaucracy as does the reader in the seemingly endless text.<br />I still have no clear idea why this novel is supposed to be one of the greatest of the 20c.  While it pioneered a kind of political surrealism, it just goes in circles and nothing is ever resolved. Perhaps its sheer consistency is what makes academics proclaim its greatness.  There is little clear plot and the nothingness of it just goes on and on in a static Angst.<br />If you really read this, you may be as disappointed as was I.  It is yet another example of a &quot;classic&quot; that is unspeakably dull and perhaps over-rated by critics who are as far from the normal reader as an English professor can be from a lover of books.  But then, Kafka had instructed Max Brod to burn this novel, due to its incompleteness.<br />Read if you are more interested in slogging through a classic than enjoying one!

B00000J7J4|4.0|Having only heard the album Viva Santana and whatever the radio stations decide to play prior to purchasing this album, I think that Supernatural is a very strong album; despite the fact that radio stations drove Smooth into the ground.  Since, by my definition, I am not a fan (being both familiar with and liking at least 80% of a band's music) of Santana, I am not biased by the same factors a fan (by my definition) would be.  I think that the collaborations are great!  They add a slightly different flavor to the mix.  Looking back, even Viva Santana varies from rock to progressive to latin etc.  So, I see no problem with collaborating; though he (Carlos) definitely chose some strange people (except Matthews and Clapton).  However, they do not take away from the quality of the music.  There is not a single weak track on Supernatural!  Even Smooth is great (just played to death).<br />Honestly, there are too many great songs to even give highlights. However, if you twist my arm, I will tell you that (Da Le) Yaleo, Love of My Life, Migra, Corazon Espinado, The Calling, and --yes, I will spoil it-- the &quot;extra track&quot; are all awesome!  The extra track is really just an extention of The Calling.  It adds about four minutes to the song.<br />So, whether you are my definition of a fan, a casual listener of Santana, or just thinking about purchasing the album because you like what you hear on the radio, buy Supernatural!  The songs aired on the radio hardly give you a glimpse of this fantastic album!
B00005JG6R|5.0|I saw Akira as a child on an old VHS tape belonging to my brother-in-law, and from that point forth, I loved Akira.  I would go to see it in college when the local anime club showed it on the big screen, I bought a couple of the mangas it is based off, and am constantly scouting out Akira products (tshirts, etc).  As soon as I heard they were finally releasing it on DVD in English, I pre-ordered the special collector's edition.<br />The movie is still as vicious and beautiful as I remember, and I'm so glad to have it anamorphic on DVD.  I do miss the old dialogue though.  Memorized from repeated viewings, the movie seems incomplete without lines like, &quot;What are you waiting for???&quot; &quot;Then I won't tell him what's it in, huh?&quot; and so on.  I even miss the voices I remember from the old dubbing.  I wish they would have added an audio track that went with the old version... if they had done that, then this DVD would be everything an Akira fan could hope for.  As it is now, it's still the same awe-inspiring movie, and truly a classic that any Anime collector should own... just missing one piece.
B00005CDUE|3.0|Lets make it short: in the market there are about 5-6 collections of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry with Roxy Music. So... any reason for one more? Sorry - the answer is negative. It's been told for more than once, that the band made a huge change in its musical direction, so fans who like Roxy of the 70's are not in the list of Roxy of the 80's. So... if you want to buy a collection of the band, ask yourself first, if you like &quot;Flesh and blood&quot; and &quot;Avalon&quot;, or prefer the earlier &quot;Stranded&quot; and &quot;For your pleasure&quot;. Then - check up the years of the recordings (are they relevant to your taste?) and make up your decision. To me, such a mix can not get more than 3 stars.
B00005BJPO|5.0|(Ok briefly a small rant. If you are going to review a DVD please include comments about the quality of the disc.) If you are reading this you probably have already seen Akira and enjoy it. The question that I am tackling is... Is the DVD worth it? The answer is definately. A lot of care went into the restoration of this film and it shows. The film went through three seperate processes just for the image alone. The image quality is far better than watching the old murky streamline Vhs version. Akira is the perfect example of what the medium of vhs can not handle. Vhs is incredibly poor with dark or colorful images. If the image is dark like much of Akira is the picture will have  alot of grain because Vhs can't display different hues of black well. The same is true for color except instead of grain they bleed all over the place.  DVD was created to handle high contrast pictures with dark blacks and bright saturated colors. The backgrounds show so much more color and depth that it almost like see the film again for the first time. The audio is also a stellar 5.1 track. The new dub is more consice and flows better than the one on the one streamline did. In short the movie alone is worth the price of admission. Now on to the extras. The extras are thankfully on a second disc. The extras are a mixed bag. There are tons of interesting bits of information, but they are presented in such a dry fashion that you won't care. The image gallerys are nice and have everything from story boards to comic covers. The other good extra is the glossary of terms that help you understand the complexity of the movie. Two last things the menus are fantastic and so is the packaging of the disc in the tin. If you are an Akira fan do yourself a favor and buy the limited edition.
038532653X|1.0|I'm glad I read this book before giving it to my 12 year old son. I found it to be unnecessarily grim and depressing. Until the very end, Michael's life circumstances seem hopeless. In addition, I thought it a little far fetched that a young girl would think of a half dead, insect eating, somewhat grotesque man-bird as an &quot;extrordinary creature.&quot; This is not a story I enjoyed, rather I endured it. Why read something like this when there are so many other wonderful books out there for kids?  I did not recommend it to my son, and I wouldn't for yours.
0060273224|5.0|Sabriel, daughter of Abhorsen, must leave Wyverley school when she discovers the horrid news that her father is missing. She must cross the wall to a world she has never set foot on and pursue a dangerous mission with only her two friends as companions. Mogget- bound by a unknown perhaps dangerous spirit and Touchstone- imprisoned by magic and after many years set free by Sabriel. The three must travel deep into the old kingdom and in some instances- travel into the chill of death and try to save her father before it's to late... before he crosses the ninth gate.<br />  This is a breathtaking book that takes you out of this world and into a spine-tingling new world. The action and adventures come at a non-stop pace. It's a definite page-turner. Give this book a chance and you won't regret it! If you enjoyed this book you definitely should get the sequel 'Lirael'. It's worth spending the extra money for the hardcover.

B00005NGAK|5.0|This DVD convince me that this kind of art is trully magnificent! Michel Flatley is very talanted dancer. He moves in a way that astonished you
0679746048|5.0|I have to admit, before I picked the movie (I saw the movie first), I thought it was going to be some cheesy chick-flick or something. As soon as I saw it, it all changed. I was so intrigued by these characters that I emmidaitely bought the book. I loved it. Susanna's writing brought alive these characters, brought alive this un-spoken world. She discribed insanity and psychiatric conditions so vividly I was mesmorized. The book perfectly balances experiences and notions. Some chapters deal with everyday life in McLean (the hospital) while others fascinating notes, some preconceived while others totally new. The fact that this is not fiction is also relevent, as I feel deep compassion, if not a connection, towards the author. The medical papers sprinkled throughout the book reminded me that this was real. That Susanna is real. She may be your next-door neighbor. A relative. A friend. She could be you.
B000001Y42|5.0|Unlike Limp Bizkit's later albums, which are practically manufactured and so much less raw, this is back when this band was actually good.  They aren't the most talented band in the world but there is some GOOD RAW MUSIC here.  Here are my ratings for the songs:<br />1. Intro (n/a) - A slightly interesting opening.  I'd rather it didn't exist although it is tollerable.<br />2. Pollution (B) - Very raw song with some cool guitar sounds.  Fred screams a little too much at the end but other than that, it's good.<br />3. Counterfeit (A) - One of Limp's best songs.  Great heavy music.<br />4. Stuck (A) - Another great heavy song.  Easy to get into and very cool.<br />5. Nobody Love Me (C+) - Starts to get old after a while.  Okay song but it drags.<br />6. Sour (A) - A really cool slower song.  This is about the only time Fred has rapped and it actually songed alright.<br />7. Stalemate (B) - Drags a little bit in the beginning but gets really cool instrumentally about halfway through.<br />8. Clunk (C) - This sounds like filler.  Not that great of a song.<br />9. Faith (B) - It's that one cover song everyone knows of.  Okay song, not the best thing ever.  I like it though.<br />10. Stinkfinger (A) - Unique and very very good despite it's not a very popular song.<br />11. Indigo Flow (D) - Fred gives props to all his homies.  Keep it in the paper thing in the album.  This is a mess of a song with Fred trying to rap again and isn't very good.<br />12. Leech (C) - Another mess of a song.  A little better but not great.<br />13. Everything (A) - Many of the &quot;hardcore rockers&quot; out there don't want to give this song a chance but if you can stand more melodic types of music, this is very good.  Excellent way to end the CD.<br />Nothing truely revolutionary but a great album.
0380817683|4.0|I'm giving Rachel's Holiday 4 stars instead of 5 for the simple fact that it is not quite as good as Ms. Keyes prior books.  This one takes a much more serious tone and the topic is quite serious compared to `Watermelon' or `Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married'.   It took a while for this book to grab my interest.  However, it is in the end, a very, very enjoyable and educational read.  Ms. Keyes either did some serious research about the subject of addiction or has some first hand knowledge of the subject. Rachel is portrayed in a realistic manner as are the people surrounding her.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed books like the aforementioned, or Bridget Jones Diary, Otherwise Engaged, and Welcome to my Planet, Where English is Sometimes Spoken.
0060934913|4.0|Foodies who are familiar with the CIA in Hyde Park and any big city-celeb chef restaurant scene will read this book and be filled with admiration.  And fear.  Be warned - if you have any interest at all in what goes on behind the scenes in the life of an aspiring chefling, or in the kitchen of that four-star restaurant of which you are so fond, starting this book is like letting a vampire into your house.  It will grab you by the throat and you won't be able to put it down until you've sucked the last page dry.  But don't throw those bones away - use them to make stock!  BTW:Non-foodies will be looking up a lot of French terms - perhaps it should include a glossary.  This mordantly funny and fascinating read does come at you like a train wreck but you won't be able to look away and you will enjoy, I dare not say devour, every page.  The only problem I had with it is that Chef Bourdain lives for the food and seems to hold those who come to ooh, ahh and consume it in deep contempt.  Being regarded with such withering scorn by someone in the fine food industry is not my idea of customer service so I don't think I'll be eating where he cooks anytime soon and thank god he didn't become a brain surgeon but I hope he continues to write.
0767817478|5.0|Saw this movie back 1998 and did not really know what to think of it. Time passed and realized how much I had enjoyed this movie. lots of footage regularly popped up when talking about movies. Though it is a sort of Jurassic park Clone instead of living up to the Godzilla Legacy it is really enjoyable for a broad audience. The DVd is excellent. Sound is awesome and picture is crystal clear.<br />The price is a bargain and the extras are great so don't hesitate!
6305014140|1.0|You have animation in this movie...<br />...that´s about it. Picutre ´Samurai X´ (aka Kenshin OVA) with no plot...completely unnecessary sexual scenes....pointless and immoral bloodshed....and you have Ninja Scroll.<br />I don´t know why they even bother to make this as good sounded as it is. The Blind Man fight was the only decent fight in the whole thing, everything else either made me nautious or disgusted.<br />If you´re into pointless and mind-numblingly-dumb violence and rape, pick up Ninja Scroll. If you want something redeeming and having ENTERTAINMENT value, go for Samurai X or Princess Mononoke.<br />Otherwise, bleh...save your money for a bat to hit yourself with when you read reviews praising Ninja Scroll...
0783222734|4.0|The effects are astounding, so astounding that the effects over shadow even the Ian Malcolm character, which is the central character in the book.  I wanted more of Ian Malcolm because I studied Mathematics in College, and the book is brilliant.  Laura Dern is effective screaming and so are the kids.  The human character that has the spotlight is Alan Grant who is too taciturn for for this roller coaster ride.  If Goldblum wouldve given a performance as the book suggests and the Lost World, it would have been Academy Award material ( Non Technically) As a movie, it is excellent though but not 5 stars
B00003CX5P|1.0|This anticipated prequel left everyone begging for less. Less low brow Jar-Jar (better left on the cutting room floor in its entirety). The plot was threadbare, the characters two-dimentional, and the whole feel was lacking. Not worthy of the starwars name.
B000053ZRQ|3.0|I have loved bon Jovi for years, but i got to admit this is not one of their best video's.  I was at the gateshead consert only the week befor this concert was filmed and what I can't understand is why they didn't film that concert!  The night was perfect, blue skies, not a cloud in site and the band just rocked.  On the night this video was filmed it rained, the guys were soaked and to me they looked far too tired and didnt put their usual effort into the show.  Jon wasnt jumping around the satage like he did at Gateshead, but the music and the sound were good.  I think only a true Bon Jovi fan will buy this video.
B000051VWW|5.0|This is a great CD!  During her 8 years of silence, Sade' s songwriting style has become more mature, precise and 'for real'.<br />Those who deplore the lack of catchy songs do not understand that artists mature.  Do you really want her to be stuck singing 'Smooth Operator' for the rest of her career (not that it was a bad song but she' s beyond that now)?
0451199871|5.0|Ms. Agatha and Miss Marple stumped me again. Disregard the negative reviews written previously, this is vintage Christie when she was at a peak. Miss Marple and her ability to spot when people are lying, once again save the police from making the obvious error. Basically she doesn't believe anyone and begins to weed the facts thus. And I DO NOT OVER EMPHASIZE that the many suspects tell many lies in attempt to cover up anything that may humilate them. Fascinating study of human character.
B00005BJPO|5.0|This movie was so damn good that I shut it off midway through to come write this review.  I first saw Akira in 1990 or '91 at an SF convention in Virginia Beach.  Anime junkie that I am, I decided it was the best thing since leavened bread.  As soon as Streamline released the videotape I went and bought it, played it again and again.  Even if the dialogue was a little (okay, /really/) stilted in places.  Even if there were some mistranslations.  Even if things went on in the background that made no sense at all.  I wore that tape out.  But now . . . The voice actors are better cast.  The sound effects are beefed up.  The color is better.  The dialogue is smoother.  Explanations are cleverly worked into the script.  It's grittier, uglier, scarier, more ecstatic, more wondrous.  I just can't say enough good things about this movie. However, for fellow Akira-drooling-fanboys, I noted that my favorite scene got changed: the riot cop with the grenade launcher no longer growls &quot;Scumbag!&quot;  Ah well, a small price to pay.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I saw one of the Oakland, California shows relatively early in this tour. I hadn't seen Springsteen live since the late 1970's. The Oakland show was wonderful beyond words; I waited a while before buying this album because I was afraid it would spoil my memories of the live show. I needn't have worried. He closed the Oakland show with &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; and I was delighted to find it here. He also gives us &quot;41 Shots,&quot; which is as powerful as any song released by any artist in the last five years. Tracy Chapman will someday cover &quot;41 Shots.&quot;<br />But mostly this is Bruce Springsteen, with the same energy and power he had 25 years ago, telling us and showing us that this far down the road he still believes that rock and roll can save us, can redeem us. He still believes music can change the world. At a time when it sometimes seems that no one believes in anything besides greed any more, that's a might fine message.<br />The old songs are rendered in new and interesting, sometimes powerful ways. Like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, he is still experimenting, still trying to make each show fresh and interesting. Too few artists make the effort. I don't go to live shows or listen to albums of live shows to hear note for note versions of the studio tracks; I want to hear if the artist has something new to say. Bruce Springsteen will never, ever let you down; it always fresh, different and new.<br />Whether it's the whole band singing lines from &quot;Wait for Me,&quot; transforming a love song into a pledge about the future of the E Street Band, or using &quot;Tenth Avenue Freezeout&quot; to preach the redemptive power of rock and roll, the old stuff is new.<br />&quot;Land of Hope and Dreams,&quot; his closing number in Oakland, is a stunning reply to another song about sinners and trains, exactly analogous to Woodie Guthrie's &quot;This Land Is Your Land,&quot; which fans will recall from the &quot;Live 1975-1985&quot; compilation. Bruce still makes you think.<br />And then there's &quot;41 Shots,&quot; which some reviewers have criticized as 'too repetitive' in its constant refrain of the title; dudes, count the number of times it gets said. I get just about 41. You bet it's repetitive. But Bruce never does anything without a reason.<br />But the thing that struck me the most at the Oakland show and after listening to this album (other than this 51 year old's level of energy) is that the man still cares. He cares about this audience, he cares about the world and he cares about his art. And he's not afraid to let you know it. Buy this album.still makes you think.<br />And then there's &quot;41 Shots,&quot; which some reviewers have criticized as 'too repetitive' in its constant refrain of the title; dudes, count the number of times it gets said.

0871137380|5.0|This is one of those rare books that is totally gripping yet based entirely onf act. Few historical events can generate this combination of excitement, yet be incredibly moving and disturbing at the same time. <br />This book, as almost everyone knows is about the unfortunate events of OCt. 3, 1993 when a group of Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos went on a raid in Mogadishu, Somalia that was suppsoed to last one hour, yet ended up ending 18 later with 18 Americans dead and about 70 wounded. <br />THis book is a gripping story that everyone should read, for its historicakl content, yet no one will be bored by it either.

B0000028WD|5.0|This Cd is nice to listen it has many of the greats assembled for this spectacular event  like George Harrison, Eric clapton, Neil Young,Lou Reed and of course Bob Dylan. My favorite is John Mellancamp's version of Like a rolling stone and Leopard skin pillbox Hat. this is a must for classic rock fans.
0385335482|4.0|Ok, never been quite as bad as this gal, but can relate.<br />Great book.  Easy read.  Nice, strong, intelligent female character that I think most women can relate to even if you aren't a true shopaholic.<br />Read Bridget Jones and would put this one right up in the same category.  Not nearly as funny as Bridget, but still a great book.
0811826848|4.0|The photos in this book are wonderful, but I found the biographies to be a little excessive! Get ready for a long read. However, if you're like me... Its kind of nice to have a big colorful book that you can pick up now and again. When I do, I read something new each time due to its colossal size!<br />If you want a collection of great photos of the Fab Four, then this is for you! Makes a great coffee table book...<br />On another note... If you read and play music, get the Beatles Complete Scores! One of the coolest things you can get!
0812550706|3.0|Wow, close to 1500 reviews so far! This book was recommended to me by a very intelligent woman, and I enjoyed reading it. It is a relatively quick read and the pace of the story well serves the content.<br />With so many reviews, I'm sure there is not much I can add. I consider this book average sci-fi. Another recent review mentions that Card insists that he never read Starship Troopers. That may be true, but I certainly found myself thinking about that far superior work very early on while reading this one. <br />One comment, I have not seen, in any of the reviews I have read so far, mention of Card's hilarious preoccupation with which way is &quot;down.&quot; By halfway through the book, I thought I would become ill if he revisited this simple premise. The attempt at a tie in, using this 'theme', at the end was meager. <br />There was a lot of promise for exciting action in the descriptions of the games at the battle school. In my opinion, Card did not capitalize on this. Rebounding off walls, sliding along walls, 'stars' to hide behind, the enemy gate, etc. - yes, I understand all this, but it is not compelling. Ender's tricks and new ideas are offered as revolutionary grand strategy by the author. But there is not enough substance there. That would have been an interesting element on which to spend more time. <br />In my estimation, Card missed the target just a bit with this one. There were the seeds of decent ideas however (all of this touched on in other reviews). I'll probably try the other books in the Ender quartet.
B00003CY5H|5.0|&quot;The Score&quot; might not have &quot;scored&quot; at the box office, but the actors themselves stole the show in this less than ordinary heist.       Directed by Frank Oz his work was a step to the side, more or less, for him with such hit comedies as &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;, and What About Bob?&quot;  Mind you, &quot;The Score&quot; is not a perfect movie. There are a couple of large holes in the plot, particularly some things that happen toward the end. But it's so much fun watching this cast work together that it really doesn't matter.     The title refers to a difficult task presented before thief Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) with a most profitable outcome.  All that is going on with his successful Montreal jazz club and his stewardess girlfriend, Diane (Angela Bassett who doesnt get much screen time as I had hoped for), he could gain money for his participation in ripping off the U.S. Customs house to finally settle down in his new law abiding life.     The U.S. Customs house has confiscated a rare French piece of national treasure.  The only eyes that have bared witness to it's being are the U.S. Customs agents and the &quot;inside man&quot; named Jack Tellar (Edward Norton) with his alter ego attitude who mops the floors as a janitor inside the U.S. Customs house.     In spite of the risks involved, Wells decides to go ahead with the &quot;score&quot; even with his financial partner Max (Marlon Brando) breathing down his neck with suspicious untold truths.     With a change in genre for Oz, my hat goes off to this film.  With this star filled cast and jazzy score by composer Howard Shore, everything fit into place.  The cast shared a give-and-take relationship between each other.  I sensed at one point that Brando was ad living a few times on screen with De Niro, but still gave the two main characters a chance, De Niro and Norton, to earn the spotlight.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Well, I just read that MGM is issuing a special editon of this DVD. I hope they improve the sound as the sound of the first DVD is lame. Its 1999 sequel (The Rage Carrie 2) has a super Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. Anyway this DVD's picture quality is good. Bright and sharp. You won't notice this is a 1976 movie. You should know the story by now. About a nerdy high school student played by Sissy Spacek who has telekinetic power. And things turn deadly as the other students make fun on her during prom night. John Travolta, Nancy allen and Amy Irving Co star. Brian De Palma reunited Travolta and Allen 3 years later in Blow out that is coming soon on DVD as well.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Some say that Snatch is a poor follow up of Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  I say that this is an improvement on his signature style, an aggressive and a supercharged 21-gun salute to Britain film/filmmakers. The deftness displayed in this writer/director's pacing and editing is at times electrifying and sometimes simply beautiful. The soundtrack is not only superb and includes one of my personal favorite bands, Oasis, and is used to great comic effect as an poignant accompaniment to certain scenes.  <br />A more violent film you aren't likely to see this year. In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element, revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would give  his right arm for. (And in one case, I mean that literally.)  <br />After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and multi-crosses,  Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem -- and how will they get it? Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost his bark.<br />And every one of these stories is hilarious.<br />Vinnie Jones (Gone in 60 Seconds) as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who chills his  prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) is caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina, a stressed jeweler who can never catch a break; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their roles. In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still buff from Fight Club, as a slur-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages to get one step ahead of the crowd.<br />Guy runs through the entire pantheon of MTV camera tricks: slow motion, fast motion,  stop motion, reversemotion, low angles, high angles, upside down camerawork, and more.<br />There are some funny lines, and some of the violence is quite inventive. Several times in this movie I was reminded of the &quot;strange occurrences&quot; theme seen in Magnolia. All in all this film I wholeheartedly recommend.
B00000K32J|5.0|FoF is an extended, much, much more lavish version of the original LotD (filmed 2 years earlier).  With 3-4 times the number of dancers, even more elaborate stage settings than LotD, almost every single dance from the original, plus a good number of new surprises (not to mention a higher video quality), FoF is a truly, amazingly grand spectacle.  One also can't help but marvel at Flatley's extraordinary talent - not just in dancing, but in production, directing, designs, the flute, everything.  When will we ever see such talent again?<br />But if you want to see Flatley at his very, very best, if you want someone even more energetic, exciting, passionate, and captivating than what you already see in FoF, you really should watch LotD.  I hate to say it (and I hope I'm wrong!), but the 2 extra years added to Flatley's age (Flatley was in his mid-30s in LotD) did seem to make some difference.  The man was still awesome in FoF (I'd say 6 stars out of a possible 5), and I'm not sure even today (Flatley being in his early 40s) if there's a greater tap dancer/artist than he.  But I do miss the Flatley in LotD (I'd say worth even a couple of more stars than his out-of-the-world performance in FoF).  <br />Ironically, while I think Flatley's added years were a drag on the man, the other major dancers actually came out better in FoF than in LotD.  They were noticeably more confident, more expressive, and dared to explore more new moves in FoF.  I think that's because most of them were in their 20s, so the extra years only served to make them more mature, sophiscated dancers without adding the physical burden to them.<br />Between FoF and LotD, it's hard to say which is better; but for a Flatley fan, LotD is definitely an even more exhilarating experience than FoF.  I'd recommend getting both FoF and LotD - you'll find different reasons to like them both.
080013558X|5.0|If you're looking at this movie from an adult perspective and comparing it to the musical show - you probably will notlike it. If you look at it as an adaptation targeted at children (and the children at heart) you'll probably love! I think that's the reason why the reviews describe it as either fantastic or terrible (beauty is definitely in the eye - and heart - of the beholder! I first saw it as a kid - way before I even knew there was a stage original and loved it - I loved the play as well (years later) but ther're not the same thing. Both are great in their own way.
0312263120|2.0|I like a good plot, I love good characters that move, flow, and adapt in a seting.  A good closure is the heart of any good novle.  This book, while writen pritty well fails on most fronts.  Were I nsa, I'd never have hired most of these people.  Susan reminds me of a chick from &lt;fill in the blank&gt; horor flick.  She's frightened and acts like a blond bimbo.  Greg just goes nuts and doesn't act like I'd immagin he would.  Dave, the perfect companion to sexy Susan should have been killed!  The killer, like in so many books keeps f...ing it up.  One can't miss that many times if one is good.  The ending, the closure is stereotipical.  Down to the write and the day is saves.  There is no sence of the events really hitting this cast of characters, no real aftermath.  The only thing that's of some interest is the reader's digest historical lesson on cryptography.  Though things are simplified, and the nsa isn't as secret as he would lead us to believe.  It's a great book when you're on the pot. :)
B00005BJPO|5.0|Animation, storytelling, dialogue, emotion, production design, sound, music, action and vision. Few films manage to adequately address more than one or two of these aspects; fewer still manage to cover half. Akira is one of no more than 15 movies ever made that successfully manages to pull all of them together into a stunning film that is not only a feast for eyes and ears, but for the mind. Repeated viewings don't just develop further appreciation -- they will spur more questions in your mind and your imagination. Among all films it is clearly one of the best ever made, and within the broad genre of animation there may never be a film of its equal.
B00003CX5P|2.0|My husband and I went to see &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; on our honeymoon in Marco Island. We had both seen and enjoyed the original Star Wars movies (well, he really didn't care much for the Ewoks). So we were eagerly anticipating the &quot;prequel&quot;.  My husband liked the movie, but I was disappointed.  First, almost all of the characters (with the exception of Darth Maul) acted &quot;wooden&quot; - you really didn't care about them - even if they survived or not.  Second, they really should've developed the main characters roles a little more - like knowing something about their past and how they're important to the lives of those they interact with (like between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan).  Third, while computer animation is a great thing, too much of it (which this movie had alot of) can take away from the &quot;realism&quot; of the scenes.  Now, don't get me wrong - the movie wasn't a total loss:  I loved the duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and the racing scenes felt like I was playing POD, but I felt the movie was missing something.  Maybe I expected it to be along the vein of the first 3, but it could have been alot better.  But I will buy &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; when it comes out on DVD for my husband because at least someone in the household will enjoy it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|. . .and that is to present, in one album, all the Beatles' #1 hits.  <br />Some of these hits are better than others; some of my favorites were never (apparently) #1 hits!<br />It's interesting:  only one of the songs presented is a George Harrison original, (the rest being Lennon/McCartney) demonstrating that Harrison's talent was unappreciated in his day, and that he was definitely overshadowed by his band-mates.<br />I also find it interesting that the largest bulk of #1 hits comes from the Beatles' early years, before they got strung out on booze, dope, and Eastern mysticism.  Very little music from this phase of their career is represented.  Then, at the very end of their career together, when they resumed doing truly innovative music, the #1 hits started coming back.<br />Anyhow, while not every song will appeal to every fan (I could have done without &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;) the true Beatles' fan will want a copy of this album.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's good to finally find a band that has some challenging guitar work. I've been listening to Limp Bizkit for a long time, and now, after listening to Tool, i think LB suck. Cuz what I like to do is be able to play the song of my favourite band using tabs off the net. LB's songs are so stupidly easy, there's no challenge!<br />So with Tool it actually takes a while to work out how to play it.<br />First of all i'll warn you, if you don't like songs that go for over 3 or 4 minutes (pop songs in other words), don't buy this album.<br />All the song on this album are great. If I had to rate each track it'd go a little somethin like this:<br />1) THE GRUDGE. This song starts with a really great riff, sounds like bass but isn't. I'd never heard Tool at all before i bought this album, but as soon as I heard this song, I knew I was in for a great experience.<br />2) EON BLUE APOCALYPSE is a great instrumental, fairly short, but sounds really good.<br />3)THE PATIENT This and Lateralus are my favourite songs on this album. The lyrics are really good.<br />4) THE MANTRA consists of haunting noises made by whales, it's pretty cool, but I usually skip it.<br />5) SCHISM was the first song I heard from this album, I saw it late at night on a music program on TV, I thought: Wow this is some sick stuff, I should get their new album. I wasn't dissapointed of course.<br />6)PARABOL sorry to say but this is a fairly boring song, but it's still a great leadup to Parabola.<br />7) PARABOLA is a really great song, it's probably the heaviest song on this album next to Ticks &amp; Leeches. The lyrics are truly inspiring.<br />8) TICKS AND LEECHES This is one of the angriest songs I've ever heard, Maynard seems to be screaming about how his fans were looking forward to this album with such expectation, that he must've felt really pressured. A cool song.<br />9) LATERALUS is a totally awesome song, great lyrics<br />10) DISPOSITION is the best instrumental on this album, though it does have a couple of lines of lyrics here and there. This song can stick in your head really badly. Just today I couldn't stop singing, &quot;Mention this to me... mention something...mention anything...and watch the weather change&quot;<br />11)REFLECTION is very long and very good. This song truly shows off Maynard Keenan's amazing vocal talents.<br />12) TRIAD is another really good instrumental<br />13) FAAIP DE OIAD is just a bunch of static and drumming and some schizo talking about aliens... go figure...<br />All in all this is the best album I own (next to the other TOOL albums). If you're looking for a band with amazing guitar/bass work, awe-inspiring vocals and totally unbelievable drumming (in very hard to work out time signatures), let me tell you, you have to get this CD.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Simply put - Sigur Ros figured out how to change the sound of rock without losing the reason we all buy this stuff - because it is melodic and moving.  Otherworldly sound and lyrics even Icelandic people can't understand, its what Radiohead wished they could have done with their last two albums, but didn't.  You won't do better than this one for quite some time.
B000002U8A|5.0|If you followed Duran Duran in the 80's and 90's, you'd be hard pressed to find anything more energetically charged than &quot;The Reflex&quot;. That song, in my opinion, put Duran Duran on the map. The entire album, 7, is the best work they did to date, and it would be hard for even Duran Duran themselves to top. Union of the Snake, and New Moon on Monday also carried great beats as well as really well put together videos. The Reflex's video made you run right to the ticket window and buy a ticket to their show when they came to your town to play. If you like 80's music, this CD is a MUST for your collection.
B00005B4GU|1.0|If you've landed here because Radiohead used to provide you with a satisfying alternative to today's popular sound, I am sorry to have be the one to tell you this, but you are not going to like thsi album.  Music exists to move us and to stimulate the right side (for most us) of our brain.  This album will stimulate the part of the brain that gets irritated with sound of a squeeky balloon.  There is one song here - Knives Out - that is worth a darn.  The good news is that I have a suggestion for you.  I recently discovered Sigur Ros, from Iceland, after reading an article in the Economist.  The Economist doesn't write reviews of pop music, so the fact they did review their record called Agaetis is noteworthy.

B000002NC4|5.0|If you've landed here because you know BTS well, then skip this review.  If, on the other hand, you're here because an Amazon link piqued your interest, then let me help you out.  I landed here a while back because I bought the Flaming Lips &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;.  I have since listened to all the BTS records.  Choosing where to start (and stop) in my mind is easy.  Perfect is the album to buy - it is far and away the best this band has ever created and it is a minor late 90s masterpiece, certainly on par with the Soft Bulletin.  Each of the songs on Perfect takes you on a mini musical journey, starting with one melody and transitioning to one or more others over the course of 5-8 minutes.  The sound is intense and epic.  Their other albums are nowhere near as accomplished. Like the Lips, BTS mined the short, alternative (i.e., loose, twangy, Pavement-like) sound of early 90s rock on earlier albums, like There's Nothing Wrong, and again on Keep It Like A Secret and the new Ancient Melodies.  No doubt about it, Carry the Zero, The Weather, In the Morning, Reasons and Big Dipper are great songs, but compared to I Would Hurt or Out of Site off Perfect, they pale. Highly recommended.
B000002LIM|5.0|One word, folks: phenomenal. I'll admit it, I was skeptical when a friend told me how good this score was a week before I bought it a year ago. Batman? That movie through which Tim Burton recieved his fame in 1989? A movie that I've only seen once or twice in the span of my 17 year life span? Psssh. Yeah right. Waste 15 dollars on a film score that supposedly has &quot;great instrumental power&quot; and &quot;wonderful blended voices&quot;? Well, I did. And to this day, which is indeed about a year ago after I purchased it, it still engulfs me with its beautifully executed precision. From 'The Batman Theme' to 'The Batman Theme Reprise', this score keeps the listener on their toes. Even in the midst of more current soundtracks, this one holds its own. I'm not saying that this score is the essence of all soundtracks, nor am I saying that this is the only one you should have in your CD player all the time. Take it from me: this CD is excellent. Even though you might not be interested about film scores in general, this is the one that will get you interested.

B00004XQ83|5.0|This movie is wonderful for the music, but also has fantastic acting and a great storyline. Light at times, but equally significant and thought-provoking. George Clooney shows his range. Whoever wrote this wonderful screenplay definately deserves an Oscar. I was also introduced to some great singers.
0441172717|5.0|This was much better than I expected. Frank Herbert truly does create a very realistic world that does seem somewhat likely to be our future. Some of the characters do seem a little weird for their age (Paul, Chani, etc.), but this is all explained in later books. This is much more than a science fiction novel. Even someone who didn't like science fiction would like this book about polictics, religion, ecology, and people in general.

6301959957|3.0|In my opinion the movie was quite interesting, mostly because of the vintage airplanes shown. Anyhow, it is a pity that the director choosed to tell almost the whole story from the bomber-crews point of view, especially as there were a lot of scenes filmed from outside the plane, including cameras placed on the Me 109:s, that never made it to the finished movie. Someone wrote that they should have used P-47:s or P-38:s instead of the P-51:s that didnt exist in the era depicted in the movie, but those aircraft are all to rare to be assembled in sufficient numbers for a movie like this. You have to take what you can get! It shall also be remembered that one of the five B-17:s assembled for the movie, the French F-BEEA, made the ultimate sacriface when it swung off the runway and chrashed at Binbrook during the filming. Fortunately, the crew survived, but the B-17 was totally consumed by fire.
0812550706|5.0|It is impressive to see a war that was caused because of poor communication. That's quite like wars during the Dark Ages. This war took place in the future, however. This shows the Human race going to a &quot;higher level&quot;, should I say. The wars are leaving the state of being between countries, and moving to between planets! Ender Wiggin hates the idea of war and joins the fight because of force. Colonel Graff turns out to be his real enemy, however, not Bonzo, or Bernard, or the other armies. Petra Arkanian turns out to be about the only girl in the whole school and becomes Ender's friend.<br />       &quot;Take my monitor away, and I become just like Peter&quot;, Ender said. Ender seemed to hate his brother, but suddenly turned out to be exactly the same as him. He took down a boy known as Stilson who is considered to be Ender's mean bully. &quot;Peter has no care or love for anybody,&quot; is the thought that Valentine and Ender both share. However at the great battle school that Ender is sent to, he starts to want his love. Valentine, his older, and caring sister can never understand this when she sees him once more. Peter still doesn't love him when he becomes the leader of the world and Ender is on the old alien world.<br />          Valentine loved Ender more than anybody. Still, she turns to become more like Peter when she becomes the new, and famous &quot;Demosthenes&quot; alongside her &quot;honourable&quot; brother, &quot;Locke&quot;. Valentine hates being with her hated brother rather than the little brother that she always loved, and protected.<br />          Ender gets training from the great Mazer Rackham, whom has led the Humans to victory before. He trains Ender at the Command school to become a great admiral, and so he does and wins the third invasion with his team.<br />          This is an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anybody who wants to read anything.
0780622553|3.0|I am upgrading my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Watching DARK CITY again while listening to Roger Ebert's commentary made me more appreciative of this film. I still find the &quot;mind battle&quot; at the end to be hokily done, effects-wise. If I listen to the Director's commentary track I may like the movie even more. I will definitely keep the DVD now.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|Considering the spy theme of Sexbomb, it was appropriate that I first heard this song in a Moscow nightclub during the summer of 2000.  Although I have a good ear for identifying artists, I didn't believe it was Tom Jones, though, until I later asked the DJ in another club in St. Petersburg.  I soon learned that this song is hugely popular with the youth in Russia, as well as throughout Europe.  So I was doubly surprised when I couldn't find the Reload CD at major music chains, even by special order, when I got back to the States.  But of course Amazona had it!  [I later bought another copy of Reload back in Russia for about $1.75 -- all CDs are very inexpensive throughout Russia.]  Although Sexbomb has shown up on a couple of TV programs, I have yet to run across someone who has heard this song before I played it for them.  This is a shame, because it's such a great track -- I won't attempt to describe it, you just have to buy this CD and hear it for yourself.  The remainder of Reload is as good as Sexbomb, and your favorite will just depend on your personal taste.  Everyone who hears Reload asks incredulously, &quot;Is that TOM JONES!!?&quot; followed by, &quot;Wow!&quot;  Considering its popularity in Europe, it's no wonder that Reload is #8 in Amazon sales with the Army.  It's simple -- once you hear it, you have to have it!
B00005B4GU|4.0|How do you even approach this album? It's powerful enough to completely change the magic that was Kid A, the perfect album. Now I have to question it- what if, for instance, they put 'Pyramid Song' as the second song of Kid A instead of 'Kid A', or 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors' instead of 'Idioteque'. Some will say this is more accessable than Kid A, but it's not- it might be more &quot;conventional&quot;. There ARE songs with guitars, notably 'I Might Be Wrong', with an infectious guitar lick and the most radio-friendly, 'Knives Out', and the buildup of the wonderful, piano-driven crescendo of 'You and Whose Army?', which is the best song you'll find here. Amnesiac is just AS good as Kid A, but it's missing the conceptual glue to stick it all together, and that's where this album falls short. However, it nearly makes up for that in lyrics, which are significantly better than Kid A's. 'Pyramid Song' has some of the best lyrics Thom's ever written, probably my favorite; and there's the sheer mock-ment of record companies and modern-day music in the very catchy 'Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box' (&quot;I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case...&quot;) and 'Dollars and Cents', where he almost desperately sneers &quot;We are the dollars and cents, and the pounds and pence, the marks and yen...&quot; The can't-quite-grip beauty of Kid A is still here, and it may even surpass it. The most beautifully haunting songs like 'Pyramid Song', 'You and Whose Army?', and 'Like Spinning Plates' are the inaccessable gems of the album. Amnesiac ends on a different note than the rest of the album, with the New Orleans death march of 'Life in a Glass House', which I also love. The only thing I really can criticize is 'Hunting Bears', which I don't think is a bad track, but 'The Amazing Sounds of Orgy' or 'Trans-Atlantic Drawl' should've been put there instead. Do buy this album, but don't look at the liner notes; they're far too disturbing... I'm afraid to open the CD case.
0783229372|4.0|Ok, so it's not The Poseidon Adventure, however it's better than some viewers have implied it is.<br />The movie does focus around a sabotage attempt, which is still considered by many to be a plausible cause of the accident, however the film does not take the liberty of undeniably concluding that a bomb, or single saboteur cause the disaster.<br />The sets are impressive.  If you've seen pictures of the actual interior of the Hindenburg, you will certainly appreciate the level of detail taken to authenticate the ship.  The period costumes (especially Bancroft's) are good too.<br />The disaster sequence was shot in black and white so that actual news reel footage of the event could be incorporated in.  That footage is especially chilling to watch since you can see the actual passengers and crew (some on fire) jumping from the ship as it crashes.<br />George C. Scott does a fine job as the colonel assigned by the German government to protect the ship, and Anne Bancroft is intriguing as the witty refer puffing countess.  Look for Katherine Helmond (Soap's Jessica Tate) in a rare non-comedic roll.

0440133688|4.0|The 'House of God' is an excellent attempt to let the reader understand what an internship in internal medicin is about. Many of the situations are realistically described using a colourful, often sensitive language. All the figures appearing in the story are very classical without being exagerated or unreal. The author talks about everything humans usually try not to see, not describing doctors as brave heroes nor as ignorant idiots, but as humans.  Of course Shem did not mention all kinds of problems interns (or some interns) are confronted with during their internship: not every intern has a father who is dentist and who can send his son money to support his 'one-year-holiday'. Not every 'intern' is far from any materialistic problems. Dr.Basch in the 'House of God' has been lucky in the end because he had the tool to win this impressively horrible year: love and care from his girlfriend, who is 'the' real hero of the 'House of God'
0553274503|5.0|\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is one of my favorite books. I am in 10th grade, and I first heard of this book in 8th grade when I read the excerpt version of the book. Later I purchased the book, thinking it would be much the same as the excerpt, but was very pleasantly surprised to find many issues and plot developments that were not included in the excerpt. The book is about Charlie Gordon, a mentally retarded adult who undergoes an operation that triples his IQ, and what happens to him and his life and those surrounding him as this process is carried out. Definitely a tearjerker, but also very believable, though the plot itself is as yet unlikely as far as I know! I think what makes it believable are the emotions that Charlie goes through as he becomes a genius - rejection and fear among them - emotions that all of us have dealt with at some point in our lives. I also enjoyed the writing style of this book - it starts out with spelling, grammar, and usage errors to show Charlie's innocent way of thinking and his moderate retardation, and progresses into extremely advanced language and ideas as his IQ triples. There have been two movies based on this book, but as is usually the case, I have to say the book is far far better and more complex. I can hardly say a bad thing about \\"Flowers for Algernon\\"; it is simply the ideal book for all those who think on a higher level.
0694003611|5.0|This book has been part of my son's going-to-bed routine for almost a year. In fact, after leaving our copy behind somewhere while on vacation, we had to buy another! Now almost a year and a half, he loves finding the mouse on every page and has learned about saying goodnight to people and toys as a way to settle down before going to bed. And, really, it's just the kind of book that makes you smile when you put it down for the night. ;-)
0425180638|5.0|After reading Southern Cross recently, I was hesitant to waste any time or money on this one, but I sure am glad that I did. The Last Precinct ties up a lot of loose ends in the Kay Scarpetta saga, and this one makes Kay more human. I liked her so much better in this book, because the hunter becomes the prey, and she has feelings that Patricia Cornwell describes beautifully.  I absolutely loved detective Marino in this story. As a ten year friend/coworker/homicide detective with Kay Scarpetta, in this novel his frailties are exposed, his life explored, and he becomes the man you hate to love but have to.  Lucy, Kay Scarpetta's niece is also well defined in this story, and having \\"accidentally\\" shot her partner and nearly killing Kay Scarpetta's intruder, her judgement is questioned and she may be forced to leave her lifelong career. This spurs her to come up with an idea, an idea called \\"The Last Precinct\\", sort of her own law enforcement agency, where when all else fails, unsolvable crimes land in The Last Precinct. More than capable Lucy, her friend Teun, and maybe even Kay will try to enravel what the world's best law enforcement people could not. It is an interesting idea, and Patricia Cornwell weaves the story around it. Kay's ex-lover, horribly murdered, is a post mortem member of this last precinct already.  The descriptions of Kay at her best, in the morgue, are unbelievably graphic. The weak of heart will definitely squirm throughout this book, but the descriptions are what attaches the reader firmly to the story.  This is, without a doubt, one of Patricia Cornwell's absolute best ever.  You will turn page after page with increasing intensity, missing the story when you are unable to be reading, and contemplating it's dilemmas all day. Don't miss it!
B000002BYD|4.0|This cd is great, it has so much variety that any PJ fan of will love it. If you preferred songs from No Code, than you will like Wishlist, and Faithful. If you liked the raw energy of Vs. than you will love Do the Evolution, MFC, Brain of J. I really loved Do the Evolution after hearing it a few times, and realizing the same group did it that did Better man. Eddie shows his great variety vocals especially in Given to Fly, where it starts slow and builds up almost like a wave. It doesn't have the big radio hits of previous albums, but almost every song is good. I think it's Pearl Jam's best album. If you really are a true fan, you should get this one, despite not being radio hits...all the songs are catchy, and you will find yourself listening to the same one several times in a row.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|This is a note to let all of you Akira fans out there know to be cautious and check your store's return policy before buying this DVD.  I bought it yesterday only to bring it home and have my DVD player reject it - repeatedly.  My DVD player is a JVC and can play DVD's, Video-CD's, and CD-ROM's with region 1 encoding, and it plays all of my other DVD's (about 200 of them) just fine, but will not play Akira.<br />I took it back and exchanged it for another one off the shelf, picked at random, and that one wouldn't play either.  My DVD player is about 2 years old, that's the only thing I can think of that might explain it, maybe there's some kind of new technology on this DVD that the technical specs don't talk about.  There certainly isn't any information about such a thing on the packaging.  It just don't play.<br />So enjoy the DVD with caution.  Almost all of the reviews I've read about the DVD so far are dated before it was actually available (7/24/2001), so keep in mind that a lot of these people hadn't actually bought and played the DVD at the time.<br />I don't know if the Special Edition has any of these problems.  Hope this helps.
B000001EGA|2.0|Come on people, this was always overrated.  It was the continuation of EJ's big downslide that began with Caribou.  Outside of the title cut, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, and (maybe) Curtains, there's nothing memorable about this album.  I was disappointed when I bought it 26 years ago and I still find it a letdown from his earlier work.  If you want great Elton, listen to the amazing string of 5 albums that began with Tumbleweed Connection and ended with Goodbye Yellowbrick Road.
6305363668|5.0|Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films of all times, together with 2001. The best quality it has is that the fact of being a sci-fi film does not overshadow the interesting plot. Far from being vacuous and pretentious like f.ex. The Matrix and  many other sci-fi movies, Blade Runner presents us a very interesting story which revisits at the same time the myth of Frankenstein and the life-myth of Christ: very very interesting indeed. The actors are good, especially Rutger Hauer, who interprets the more human character of the film. The new scene (well, old one but not added in the 1982 version) of the unicorn (the dream-the paper unicorn) introduces a new nuance in the story: since the unicorn has been a dream dreamt by Deckard, he is a replicant himself; they know his past, his dreams...
0140434135|5.0|The story of Northanger Abbey is really the story of the literary influence of fiction in Jane Austen's day. At a time when fiction was still spoken about in whispers and the subject of much debate, Ms. Austen was writing this epithet to the genre. Many believe that Northanger was the means of Austen's scorn for gothic novels. However, a closer look reveals a bold defense of the fiction writers of her day. This, alone, makes the book a treasure chest - because not only does Austen give you a picture of society's views of all things poetic, but actually lists novels that were popular in her time. Specifically, she lists novels and authors she personally enjoyed. <br />The power that novels seem to hold over her leading lady, Catherine, was not a source of derision for the silly, flighty escapades of young ladies - but another way of Austen's showcasing the power of the written word - fictional word, that is. Here, she addresses the audience of her novel directly, and most provokingly in places - arguing those attributes of fiction novels which she believes show a greatness of mind. <br />Because of the insecurity of fiction, she actually published her novels anonymously as did many other authors mentioned in her first novel - this one not being published until after her death. I have found great personal pleasure in seeking out and indulging myself in the many authors she lists whom she personally enjoyed and was inspired by. In reading them, I feel that I have discovered more about Ms. Austen and what made her brilliant mind tick. My imagination tells me that a glance at Catherine was a little glance at Jane.
B000002HFU|5.0|ODB may not be pretty to look at, but he got some serious \\"disposition\\".  And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you need to go out and buy this cd now.  I used to only love his single \\"Shimmy shimmy ya\\" because it reminded me of the great Wu-tang style.  Then I listened to the rest of the album and I could not believe my ears.  Yes, ODB is raw, but he has so much energy and imagination.  \\"Goin' down\\"(song #10) has got to be one the the greatest musical masterpieces of the 20th century.  In this one song alone can you see all of ODB's genius: throat sounds, his signiture screaming, various rap styles, and his rendition of \\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\".  He doesn't go at this album alone though.  Method Man, the GZA and RZA(producer as well) ...make guest spots on several songs.  This album will not disappoint.  ODB is a true original in the hip hop community and its time he got some due respect.
078401213X|1.0|I will first concede that I am not generally into &quot;art-house&quot; movies, which could explain (at least partially) why I HATED this film. However, considering there are plenty of art-house films I really do like (e.g. The House of Yes), my dislike for Pi must stem from something deeper, like the fact it's supposed to be a math thriller.  I can't believe this movie's gotten such good reviews.  I simply don't get it.  And although I recognize that scathingly bad reviews aren't generally recognized as particularly helpful, I'm willing to take that risk if it will save even ONE person from having to watching this awful, awful movie.<br />It's about some guy who's a math genious and there's all these weird issues going on inside his head and strange religious people are supposedly after him because of his freaky genious mind. All very disturbing. Ironically, also manages to be all very boring. I just couldn't get into the idea of a &quot;math thriller.&quot; Think about that for a while. Math. Thriller. Those two words simply don't belong in the same sentence. Really. I'd stab myself repeatedly with a dull pencil before I'd watch this movie again, it was THAT bad. <br />I guess if you want an art-house &quot;let's think about how deep this movie can be&quot; kind of experience, Pi might be worth the endeavor. It is, after all, pretentious enough to make it appear deep.  At the end of the day, though, it still ends up being nothing more than a really awful movie.  Why?  Because it simply makes no sense.  I'm not retarded, I understand the premise, and actually find the mathematical aspect of it fascinating.  Unfortunately, I also find the whole thing to be incredibly poorly executed.  I find whole parts of the movie completely irrelevant to its central theme, and things that made no sense were put in there as if to accentuate the &quot;profound.&quot;<br />Sooo....if incoherence registers with you as &quot;deep,&quot; then this movie's for you.  If, however, you'relooking for a movie that actually makes some sense, then please, please, PLEASE:  skip it and save yourself the agony of stabbing yourself with a dull pencil to numb the pain of watching something so bad.
0064471837|5.0|This book is most definatly one of my favorites! I think it is a book that could relate to all audiences. I mean there's action, adventure, suspence, heroism, and even a small romance plot. I used to get so mad that our library only caried on copy. When ever i wanted to borrow it, it was always out. I finally ended up buying the book after i had already read it 4 times! I definatly recomend this book to any person who loves fantasy or fiction! ENJOY!
B00004STPT|5.0|Having collected many scores througout my life from composers like Williams, Goldenthal, Silverstri, Horner, and Elfman, Zimmer's Gladiator is not only impressive, it's required for any score collector.<br />After seeing the movie on video, and having seen all the other major blockbusters in the theatre, I was disappointed with myself by not having seen the film in the theatre; however, I had done something unordinary of myself, and I had bought the score before I viewed the film.  <br />Wow! Having never seen the film, the music painted a grand, epic film.  After seeing the film, I was not disappointed.  This score in relation to the scores of 2000 summer flicks such as &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; gives the best listening experience of all. <br />This CD is original in the fact that Zimmer himself admits to composing 17 original themes for this score (buy the DVD, you won't be disappointed).  Zimmer mixes his music so cleanly and purely, you are led to believe that all the instruments are acoustical and not some of them being digital.  I've played this CD numerous times, at home, driving, or at work.  In all realms, I've listened to this CD completely, without skipping tracks- they're all wide in their range of tone color, melody, tempo, and harmony.  I, like many other critcs on this site, seriously doubted the More Music from Gladiator(second disc of deleated and edited tracks), and I was gladly mistaken.  Both discs are worth buying.<br />Although Zimmer (in my humble opinion) did not follow through as extensively in the realm of themes with Pearl Harbor, I believe this score is his finest compared to that of The Rock or Criminson Tide.  If you like action films or films whose music and shear scenes grip you in wondermint every time, make this disc a part of your collection.  You will not be disappointed in the slightest.
B000002AQQ|4.0|It's strange.  Virtually every song on this collection is great.  Individually, I would gladly listen to any of them.  Yet I almost never find myself pulling this soundtrack out to listen to.  Maybe it's because there's no bite to the selections -- every tune is pulled from the most superficial 1% of the most superficial 1% of the songs that we remember from their time periods.  Maybe it's like another of the reviewers said -- I have almost every song here on another album somewhere in my collection.  But in contrast to the truly great soundtracks out there (&quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; leap immediately to mind, for a few recent examples), there's no overarching vision here.<br />I won't use this opportunity to draw the parallel that some might want to see to the film.  Actually, I find the film wonderfully inspired and immensely watchable.<br />Anyway, if you're one of those people who puts in a CD and skips around to your two or three favorite tracks, or if your collection of classic 50s, 60s, and 70s rock/pop is small, I suppose this is a good bet.  Otherwise, there's just too much great stuff out there to burn your money on this one.
B00003CWL6|5.0|There are some moments in time where you begin to ackowledge the fragility of life.  Sometimes it comes in the shape of a personal experience, or you might witness it through someone else's lives around you.  Or in this circumstance, a lesson may also become revealed in a piece of art.  I must admit that when I went to see &quot;American Beauty&quot; upon release in the theatres, I knew that I was going to see a film that was really groundbreaking.  I heard all the buzz on TV, read about it online and in the papers, but considering I am a world-class skeptic-I had to see the evidence for myself.<br />Well, I was totally astounded.  I think that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a deeply moving film on so many levels.  At its core, I suppose it is a film about redemption, or possibly self-redemption.  But there are so many other issues that the film brings to the surface:Distant family relationships, teenage maladgustment and alienation, love versus sex, vanity versus true happiness, amung many others.  And the true strength of the film is that these issues are brought up in a very honest eloquence, mainly due to a terrific assemblage of characters by Alan Ball and a really fantastic cast of actors.  Each character is very different on the surface, but upon examination, they are all struggling with very similar issues of identity, some fairing better than others.  Another great thing about the script is that each character is given the opportunity to really confront their problems, and we get to see how their decisions tend to bleed into the lives of those around them.  Its not difficult to identify with these people, because their situations are so common in all our lives.  But I think that it isnt often that a film can capture so many truly moving moments, however hilarious, heartbreaking, or disturbing all at once.<br />The movie also has a lot of style.  There are many repetitious uses of symbols and irony, gorgeous cinematography, a deeply moving and complimentaryscore by Thomas Newman, and a real sense of tension through editing and environments.   I cant think of a movie in the past decade that really succeeds at defining it's own &quot;look&quot; as AB does.  There are slow motion shots, weird camera angles, strange uses of color, but all integral in the quest to push the film's agenda.   There are a lot of moments in &quot;American Beauty&quot; that really transcend what is being offered in modern moviemaking.  It is a very concise, quiet, funny, sad and monumental film all at the same time.  It is terribly entertaining on one hand and heartbreaking the next.  And in my opinion, it deserves all the attention it received, even just for having the audacity to bring up the issues that it did.  But to do it with the sensitivity and elegance that it accomplished is truly extraordinary. <br />The DVD is really great.  The behind the scenes part on the menu is mediocre, but i really enjoyed watching the movie with the commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan Ball.  They really communicate what it entailed to bring the script to life, technically and artistically.  Its pretty fascinating.
B000002UAF|5.0|&quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; is one of my all-time fave Beatles' albums (and I love the movie as well).  The title track, the name of which resulted from a slip of the tongue by Ringo during a recording session, is a very danceable pop tune.  Other fave tracks include &quot;If I Fell&quot; &quot;I Should Have Known Better,&quot; and the somewhat obscure but genuinely outstanding &quot;When I Get Home.&quot;  If I made a &quot;desert island disc&quot; list, the album would be very close to the top.
6304708521|1.0|I bought this a few years ago when I was a hardcore Beatles fan... and was extremely, extremely dissapointed. If I wanted to watch stoned people act stupid I could go to a club, which I'd rather do than spend the $ I wasted on this film.<br />Bottom Line: You had to be there to like it.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was really the beginning of a growth period for the Beatles as artists and composers.  The compositions show far greater experimentation with technique and instrumentation.  One excellent example of this is &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; with its 6/8 rhythm and sitar break.  There are still some of the more perky pop elements of the early years present, as in &quot;I've Just Seen A Face.&quot;  &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a beautiful demonstration of the Beatles' transition from &quot;Love Me Do&quot; toward &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and beyond.  A real 5-star selection.
B00005JKHZ|5.0|Someday this cult classic will make it to DVD, and my freinds if enjoy fast paced car chase action movies this is a must for your collection. Not only is it a great movie, but the soundtrack of songs from such artists as Delany &amp; Bonnie, Mountain, and Kim Carnes (years before she did &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;) would be a great soundtrack if it ever was put together (Problem is back in 1970, movie soundtracks were rare, only musicals had them). <br />The movie is basically about a driver name Kowalski who's trying to deliver a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in less than 24 hours. It's filled with flashbacks and events that take place thoughout Kowalski's life all while he's speeding though the desert in the Challenger. <br />Cops, Hippies, Bikers, Gospel Faith Groups, Kowalski meets them all during his journey. <br />Read the other reviews to get more detail about the movie, but trust me, the music and cinematography are outstanding and you&quot;ll really enjoy this movie.
B000002UDB|3.0|Of all the Beatles' albums I own, this one is least frequently in the CD changer.  I do like the title cut, and &quot;I Am The Walrus,&quot; but the rest of the tracks don't do much for me.  This album feels almost as disjointed as the movie for which it serves as soundtrack.  I think it's an important piece to have in terms of fleshing out a collection, but not one that is particularly dear to me.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Every song here, except for the overdone &quot;Big Shot&quot;, is a very good to great song, all expressing thoughtful sentiments &amp; evoking dramatic sketches in vastly different emotional timbers/tones (unlike the first-rate yet more monotonous Elton John), comprisng into a great epic tapestry of first-rate melodies, lyrics, singing &amp; playing! Unlike most Top 40 songs nowadays, the songs actually MEAN something, telling double-edged truths of everyman's life &amp; universal attendent problems. Based on this album, along with Greatest Hits III, Billy Joel shows himself to be the most consistent completist singer-songwriter-player in pop/rock we have over the last 25 years.
B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Revolver&quot; remains one of my all-time favorite albums.  In fact, the more time goes on, the more I find myself returning this one to the CD player.  &quot;Revolver&quot; sees the Beatles delving further into experimentation and moving away from the more pop-py work of their earliest years.  From the edgy &quot;Taxman&quot; to the dreamy &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; ... and to my personal favorite cut &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; each piece is unique.  I am also rather fond of the unusual cover art, designed by long-time Beatle friend Klaus Voorman.  If you are an admirer of the Fab 4, you certainly need this disc in your collection.
B000056K04|2.0|Dave's weakest stuff to date. I played it for a week at most and haven't played it again. I am sure the songs sound great live but as far as the CD goes there is nothing here that is outstanding except maybe &quot;Angel.&quot; Mediocre comes to mind as well.
B00005KARK|5.0|&quot;Dumbo&quot; has always been one of my very favorite Disney films.  This tale of the little elephant with the big ears carries a valuable lesson - honor the talents of those who are different from yourself.  The musical numbers, from the humorous &quot;When I See An Elephant Fly&quot; to the sweet lullaby &quot;Baby Mine,&quot; are representative of Disney composers' best.  The animation is outstanding, with each character's personality clearly demonstrated in his or her appearance before any dialogue is added.<br />On a personal note, I was watching this movie with my nephew several years ago, and the importance of the movie's message was demonstrated for me in a very moving fashion.  The little boy looked at me solemnly and said &quot;I think his ears are cute.  People shouldn't make fun because Dumbo is different.&quot;<br />From the mouths of babes ...<br />I cannot recommend this movie highly enough to Disneyphiles, families ... everyone.
080018789X|4.0|If you like Tom Cruise, you'll probably even like it better.  I think (as many before me have contended) that Tom Cruise really doesn't act in this movie - he's just himself.  But he does play that role well.  He's a jerk in Jerry Maguire, I don't think he really loves Dorothy (is that her name?).<br />I like Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) much more, but that just might be because I'm a guy.  I think she's doing a wonderful job, although I never really understood why she fell for this Jerry Maguire hot-shot.  I liked her part because she was so dedicated to him and because she wanted to be inspired.<br />The plot is good and there are some really funny scenes as well as a couple of heart-warmers.  Definitely a movie worth owning, you'll watch it over and over again!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|David Bowie's &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; album contains some of his most interesting work. Take, for example &quot;It's No Game,&quot; one version in English and one in Japanese (the latter is the album's opening cut). Lyrically brilliant, this album sees Bowie heading into yet another direction in his ever-eclectic career (the persona here is Silver Clown, a tribute to Bowie's days as a mime under the aegis of Lindsay Kemp). The hit single from this album, &quot;Ashes to Ashes,&quot; pays tribute to the much earlier &quot;Space Oddity&quot; hero Major Tom. &quot;Scary Monsters (Super Creeps)&quot; is one of Bowie's best rockers ever. My personal favorite cut on this album is &quot;Teenage Wildlife,&quot; in which Bowie actually comments on his career and his fans (&quot;They say, David what shall I do, they wait for me in the hallways? I say, don't ask me, I don't know any hallways&quot;). This is certainly one of Bowie's best albums.<br />As an interesting aside, it is the Silver Clown persona which Madam Tussaud's recreated in wax for the London museum. The figure is currently on display at Madam Tussaud's Rock Circus in that city.
6305609721|1.0|This is one of the worst transfers to DVD that I have ever seen. The image is so soft looking it almost looks like it is out of focus. It's too bad. This is the one STAR TREK film that has appeal to both STAR TREK fans and the general public. This DVD is a big disappointment because so many of us waited a long time for it.
B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles' UK debut album, &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; remains one of my top faves from their catalog.  The title cut is one of my all-time favorite songs due to its catchy echo chorus, excellent harmonics and driving rhythm.  Of course, &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; the old Isley Brothers tune, is taken over completely by the Beatles on this album ... raucous and hard.  Other fun cuts include &quot;Boys,&quot; which sees Ringo Starr taking over on vocals, and &quot;Chains,&quot; which was originally recorded by a girl group called The Cookies.  The Fab 4 hit the ground running with this album, and didn't let up.  A must-have in any collection.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|My review will focus squarly on the issue of why didn't Pioneer just release the Special Edition at a lower price. the movie itself gets 5 stars. the price of the single disc is great consider what some companies charge for anime. the color and sound are Awesome! the dub job is fantastic. A must for anime fans. My complaint is only that Pioneer pulls a Disney in the fact that you have to pay extra money for things that should be standard. 15 bucks more for some stills and production comments is not good business. Disney did it with it's Toy Story and Fantasia box sets,charging 60 bucks or more for thing they should give away for buying the DVD. That's the reason people buy DVDs in the first place. to get all the things most VHS movies doesn't have like trailers and documentries. instead you pay extra for these things. Gladiator was a example of a great deal for under 25 bucks. you got all the extras included. Not paying an extra 15 bucks for a few trailers and some comentary. that's just Companies price gouging  because of pure greed. Most people will only just want the movie and watch the extras once or twice any way. Save your money, buy the single disc instead. you will thank yourself later.
0671034065|4.0|Despite the seriousness of the fact that somebody is trying to kill the four female friends who created The List (which started out as a joke just among them and ended up becoming known nationwide), most of the dialogue between Jaine and her next-door neighbor, Sam, was ablsolutely hilarious.  Ms. Howard did a great job of interweaving the serious with the humorous, balancing the growing attraction between Jaine and Sam with the need to find a psychotic killer who is stalking the four women.  All in all, I really enjoyed this book.
B000056NX5|4.0|maybe i'm just too used to ted neally, but was there a reason glenn carter was cast besides his hair?  he either overacted or didn't act through the whole show, and gethsemane, which is supposed to be a dramatic, emotional climax, came off as dull and boring.  Judas and Mary Magdelaine were good, though not up to my expectations, and i could barely stand to listen to Fred Johansen butchering Pontias.  <br />The rest of the acting was suprisingly good, though.  Peter had a beautiful baritone that complimented Mary perfectly in &quot;Could We start again please,&quot; (my favorite of her numbers in this production) Caiaphas was sufficiently evil (though consistently upstaged by the wonderfully creepy Annas), and Tony Vincent, of course, upstaged everyone.  i have to say that he was the reason i watched it a second time (and no, not for his looks, though they help).  he is a truly talented singer and actor, one of the few in this production that came through with both.  <br />Herod was...ahem.  well, the actor can't really be blamed for this.  he was poorly cast.  the whole idea of herod's palace being a lounge scene was ridiculous.  the actor did what he could with the part, but he couldn't salvage the scene.   The sets and costumes were good, although they obviously don't fit into ancient israel, neither did the bell bottoms of the past.  the production was never meant to be accurate as far as that goes.  <br />the song &quot;superstar&quot; in my opinion was done very well, because it portrayed the scene in the way i've always looked at it:  Jesus, in his final hours, is hallucinating.  i'm sure that's not how it was ever intended, but it feels right to me.<br />this is not for the squeamish or traditionalist, but overall the good, to me, outweighed the bad.
0452282152|5.0|I think that this is one of the best works of fiction that I've read in a long time.  It takes place in Holland during the years 1664 to 1676.  The author, Tracy Chevalier has used a beautiful painting by Johannes Vermeer to spin a beautiful story.  She's named the girl from the painting Griet, and made her a 16 year old maid in the Vermeer household. The artist is famous for his sunlit domestic scenes and considered one of the greatest of the Dutch painters.<br />I liked the fact that Griet is intelligent and seems to have an instinctive understanding of humanity.  Her quick mind helped her to traverse through a household of jealous and mean spirited people.<br />Chevalier has learned her craft well.  The characters have been so fine tuned that I felt that I knew everyone myself.  I've read a little about the life of Vermeer and it seems to me that the author did her homework.  I'll look forward to her next novel!
0880796863|3.0|The cards truly are classic and I've haven't had many problems interpretating them. The size of the cards seemed kind of irregular in the beginning, they were difficult to shuffle. But I got used to them a little later. The book however, is a different story. First off, it's readable, but the book itself is tiny. A real pain when you need help. Secondly, the language used in certain parts contain words that not even the dictionary lists. It's as if the author wrote just to see our confused faces and laugh at us.  It shouldn't take a rocket scientist to learn how to use tarot cards, so get another book.
0385335482|3.0|This book TRIED to be Bridget Jones with a credit card, but it was one-dimensional: all about shopping.  (Imagine if Bridget Jones was all about dieting).  The writing and humor is fun otherwise.
0743201140|4.0|Nothing is a magic bullet, but this book can be helpful on a personal and organizational level.  If the book could tell each person exactly what they should be doing it would probably cost lots more.  I thought that I knew myself relatively well and could identify my strengths without the survey.  The survey results yielded 4 that I knew (or could guess), but added one that really changes my perspective on things (and is true).  This newly uncovered &quot;strength&quot; has given me a lot of &quot;wisdom of hindsight&quot; about how I have achieved and failed in the past.  In my job I am using the concepts to help the people that I coach apply themselves effectively.  On a personal level I am currently using the information along with other information to describe and invent my ideal job. I will then either create it where I currently work or go find a place where I can.  What more can a person ask?                                                             P.S. Find a copy of &quot;Where do I go from here with my life?&quot; by Crystal and Bolles if you want to reinforce what you learn from identifying your strengths.
B000056VIY|3.0|I really like the producing of the songs on this album. However, Lopez's voice is not strong enough to carry certain parts in certain songs. I realize that this is what \\"technology\\" is for. Still, again, she is mediocre at best, and there are many more talented \\"musicians\\" who do deserve the spotlight such as Shakira. I don't think Lopez will have many more albums. She should have stayed with acting.
B000050XEI|4.0|After the disappointment of the Trees album, it was a long wait for Enya's latest offering &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;.  But what a delight!  With Rain, Enya does what Enya does best - beautiful piano and catchy melodies supported with soaring vocals and strings.  While the early albums contained an equal balance in the mood between both uplifting and darker minor chords, Rain tends to favor the more upbeat and lighter sounds.  If you know Enya, you'll like this one.  And, if you're a new fan, this is a good introduction.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is NOT AT ALL weird or all-electronic like some critics claimed. It's one of the best albums I've heard which carries a powerful message along the most amazing original sound using multiple instruments and perfectly mixed. Each track on this album is powerful, but the album provides the best experience when played as one piece to create the right atmosphere (preferably with eyes shut and *big* headphones). This is definitely Radiohead's best work to date.<br />Kid A is about what it's like to live in a bubble while the world explodes outside. It's the music of the blinded who say &quot;Everything is in its right place&quot;. But the relaxing organ tones are soon replaced with nightmares in the pseudo lullaby &quot;Kid A&quot;- &quot;There are shadows at the end of my bed&quot;. You can almost feel the total chaos outside in the funky-scary &quot;The National Anthem&quot; where &quot;Everyone's got the fear&quot;. Throughout the album, Thom's ironic lyrics keep criticizing the ones who refuse to see the apocalypse, as in the beautiful acoustic &amp; strings-oriented &quot;How to disappear completely and never be found again&quot; (&quot;I'm not here this isn't happening&quot;), or in the dreamy-upbeat &quot;Optimistic&quot;: &quot;The big fish eat the little ones - not my problem, give me some&quot;. The same theme continues while floating &quot;In Limbo&quot; - the feeling of &quot;living in a fantasy world&quot; where we're lost in sea but ask: &quot;don't bother me&quot;.  In the amazing electronic &quot;Idioteque&quot; the catastrophe is finally here and unveiled and people are running to the bunker &quot;Women and children first&quot; while the &quot;mobiles are chirping&quot;.  In &quot;Morning bell&quot;, we woke up too late, we're &quot;running around and round and round&quot; to leave for the bunker, in a rush, leaving home behind with &quot;the lights are on but nobody's home&quot;. The album ends with the funeral-like &quot;Motion picture soundtrack&quot;, and this is the tragic end as Thom cries: &quot;I will see you in the next life&quot;.
0790729741|2.0|This film was a travesty.  But hey- its a kids movie, right?  I can't bash it too much.  Still, watching it now it makes me angry at how such a horrible film can get by.  If you are below the age of 10, like sports, and have never seen a REAL Bugs Bunny cartoon, you might like it.  Other than that, its only saving grace is the Pulp Fiction reference with Elmer and Sam near the end- oh, and Bill Murray.  Michael Jordan's appearance is solely for the sake of showing him play ball with Jock Jams playing in the background whilst the cartoon characters stand in awe.  I'd rather watch Cartoon Network.
B00005B4GU|5.0|AMNESIAC is a dark album. And it's no wonder as it describes in greater detail the apocalypse which was only introduced in KID A. I would like to emphasize the message of the album, as I see it, as the music is not complete without it.<br />In the drum-loops based and a very upbeat &quot;Packt like sardines&quot;, Thom tries to shake the chaos off by saying &quot;I'm a reasonable man get off my case&quot;, but &quot;your life flash before your eyes&quot;. With the soft piano &amp; strings of &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; we get a taste of a beautiful afterlife where &quot;there's nothing to fear and nothing to doubt&quot;. Abruptly we go back and the catastrophe continues in the aggressive &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;, where we're told about &quot;trapdoors that you can't come back from&quot;: there's no turning back. Thom's taking a deep breath before going into &quot;You And Whose Army&quot;, where he sounds like he's giving his last powers in a final attempt at fighting back, but this hopeless attempt ends quickly: &quot;we ride tonight ... ghost horses&quot;.  In the guitar&amp;bass-based &quot;I might be wrong&quot; - we remember voices of the past suggesting - let's &quot;have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all&quot;, but this is soon regreted as the more classic Radiohead track &quot;Knives Out&quot; comes in: here we're introduced to a cannibalistic world, where people are taken and &quot;not coming back&quot; because &quot;there's no use in letting it go to waste&quot;. Old memories keep surfacing up again in a more dreamy and remixed version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot; ending with &quot;release me&quot;. In the powerful &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot; we're introduced to the cause of the tragedy as Thom takes the voice of big corporations (or the economy) who will &quot;crack your little souls&quot;, and ask to &quot;be constructive with your blues&quot;. In the innovative and beautiful &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;, it is the end and &quot;our bodies floating down the muddy river&quot;.  In the very horn-oriented funeral-like &quot;Life in a glass house&quot; the media world is &quot;hungry for a lynching&quot; so much that we have to live in a glass house because &quot;there's someone listening in&quot;.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Before I begin this review- let me say that those of you who hated this movie don't appreciate it for what it is.  It is incomparable to anything else- that is what makes it great.  Look closer at the film.  See its unique blend of slapstick, macabre, romance, lust, and music.  If you still hate it, Ok.<br />As I walked into the theatre I was prepared for something very odd- in the style of Romeo and Juliet (by the same director- horrible movie) but darker and hopefully- better.  What a treat.  Luhrmann shows his Burtonesque side wonderfully with quick camera moves and a moving score with the night being used to convey life.  The plot is somewhat old- a man and a woman who can't love each other do.  But this plot mocks itself in the play that the two write about their own lifes. <br />Kidman's character is an untouchable beauty ruined by her profession- prostitution.<br />McGregor's character is a struggling writer who meets very strange folk that lead him to his love.<br />This film recieved both acclaim and criticism for its use of modern-day music in a early 20th century time- but this keeps the audience from sinking into a boring historical fiction romance story point of view.  It keeps the characters and story alive and adds tongue-in-cheek humor to the mix.<br />In conclusion, this trip down the rabbit hole is a dark, tragic, yet joyful tale of freedom, truth, beauty, and above all things, love.
B000006Z0T|5.0|Worth it for the title track alone! Buy this one now along with Restless and Wild, Balls to the Wall(remastered coming:8/21/01),Metal Heart and Staying a Life(2CD import). Its all you need by this great band!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I'll admit it: South Side sucked me in. Before I'd heard the remix with Gwen Stefani, I had no interest in Moby. But I heard the song, and saw the video, and had to get the CD. After listening to it a while, I realized I'd heard several of the songs already (commercials and whatnot). I love this CD. Every track is a winner. This isn't one of those albums where you find yourself skipping around avoiding the &quot;bad songs&quot;. Play is a great listen. Pick up a copy today! :)
B00005BJPO|4.0|BRIEF HISTORY:  I found the first English release of &quot;Akira&quot; on VHS by Orion.  I was stunned by the story line and the action was more than appropriate...not over done.  Perfect balance between quality plot, animation, and sound.  The Orion pictures VHS English dub had super English voice dialogue.  Akira set the standard for which all anime is STILL judged.  Personally, I never cared to watch a movie and try to read subtitles at the same time, so I always wanted English dub.  Frankly, I have been very disappointed with anime ever since, with all of the new animation styles...I have only seen one other anime ,&quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;,  bring about any advancements in artistic expression in camparison to Akira.  Seems like most anime today and over the past years has been equivalent to the daily afternoon cartoons --- lets crank them out as fast as possible, less detail, less planning, less story, less everything.  Quick profit or entire artistic value...take note on which become classics.  I have to say this, &quot;How many years does it take to get Akira on DVD?!&quot;<br />EXPECTATIONS:  Like most, I patiently waited for an OFFICIAL US release of Akira on DVD.  Well I saw the VCD copy of the original English release from Malysia...not good.  Personally, not interested in the DVD release from Japan with Eng subtitles only.  Anyway I expected something any collector on any level would be eager and happy to own NOW.<br />ITS HERE:  I purchased the Limited Collectors Tin Edition with 2 DVD's (movie, extra features).  The restoration was absolutely top-notch!  The NEW English voice quality and content adequate but lacked the differentiation in the first English release.  The dialogue content in regards to the story was no better or no worse in either English release.  However I was so use to the original English release and there seemed to be more voice &quot;character&quot; in the original.  Sound was excellent and again a visual and audio treat with asolid SCI-FI story line.  Its been awhile since I watched the first VHS version and the re-release certainly ranks with any animation today!  Animation is an expression of different artists and styles, whether it be a paint brush or computer generated.  I believe any review done on either the first or second English release of Akira will give all the well deserved RAVE on this classic.<br />LET DOWNS:  I expected that the Official DVD Release really would have went after the core Anime fan down to the casual movie watcher.  Would have been nice to have seen a collection featuring the film in original Japanese dialoge format on DVD with NO editing or English additions/version.  Next, absolutely nothing about the first English dubbed version released in the US...that certainly would have been another nice addition - lot of the fan base was generated from that first English dub release, give some credit at least!?  Next, do the restoration and include that TOO.  Finally, another problem is the additional features disc 2 has poor subtitles which are difficult to read due to coloring in contrast to background colors.<br />RATING:  Found this to be difficult because I truely felt the Limited Edition with Tin could have been a collection geared to the Avid Anime fan - give something to show how the film has been viewed over the years...Japan, First Eng, Second Eng, etc.  Perhaps, Pioneer felt the avid fan probably owned every other version, but still lets get it in DVD format.  Therefore, I have to drop a point or perhaps a half point.  The single DVD release certainly could have been geared to others only interested in the re-release and nothing more.  As for &quot;Akira&quot;, will always be MORE THAN 5 Stars!!!
B000002LFZ|4.0|I'm not an avid Fleetwood Mac fan, but this album never strays far from my CD player. Rhiannon and Tusk are my two favorites, closely followed by Don't Stop, Go Your Own Way, Dreams, Little Lies, and Sara (my name!!!). This is a great listen, and every track is a hit. There are the soothing ballads, and the more &quot;pop-ish&quot; hits. Love it!
B00004RHZU|5.0|I fell in love with Pink when I first heard There You GO. That song was great since then I have bought her CD twice. It is filled with very good songs she even has a ballet on it called Stop Falling which is my favorite song on the CD. All of the songs on her CD are very good. If you don't own this CD then you should go out a get it. It will be worth your money. I can't wait until her next CD comes out.
0345350499|1.0|This lengthy book is tedioius and uninspired. The style is awkward and the recurring italics are destracting. I have never seen so much brooding packed in a single book. Do we need to know all of Morgaine's thoughts?<br />The characters are cardboard cutouts and love scenes exude no passion. I fail to see what so many people think is so great about this book. I approached it with a lot of goodwill, almost all of it dissipated by page 60, then I read on a bit more and that was that. I continued to turn the pages, reading passages here and there, but it was the same thing. I found no new insights here about Christianity or the pagan beliefs of pre-Christian Britain. Sadly, I cannot recommend this enormous volume for its educational or entertainment value.
B000002P6R|1.0|There are 2 good songs on this album - &quot;you better you bet&quot; and &quot;dont let go the coat&quot;. &quot;Quiet One&quot; is also OK. This is one of those albums that I never play in its entirety. Thankfully with CD players I can program in the above 3 songs and not have to listen to all the poor stuff on the rest of the album.<br />Anyone who says that this is a good Who album obviously doesnt get the real Who music that was made, the sixties stuff, Who sell out, whos next etc. With this album it is clear that Townshend is saving his best material for his solo albums.
630471193X|5.0|This is easily John Travolta's best work,  an all out preformance.  He finally got away from the action and got into a drama and an extremely  good one at that.  its all based nn Travolta's Birthday and how he see's a flash of light and a sound from the skies.  NO one else see's this or hears it, afterwards he becomes very intelligent and has the NSA on him and Berkely University is very interested in his theories.  But as time passes in his little town people start to fear him and his abilities.  Only a hand full of people who r still the same around him, that aren't afraid of him.  This movie will put a smile on your face throughout most the movie but it does have depressing parts that could make u cry out loud.  A great movie and very down to earth.
B00004NRUM|5.0|this album pounces on you like a Lion. I first heard of Marillion on the Dream Theater &quot;Once in a Livetime&quot; video. I liked &quot;Easter&quot;, so I went to my local CD store. This was the only Marillion CD they had, so I bought it. Upon first listen, I was bored to tears by it. I decided to keep it and give it another chance. I listened to it about ten more times, and each time I was as bored as the first. Then, one night I wanted to find some music to fall asleep by, so I put this one on. All of a sudden, I loved every song and I couldn't fall asleep until the entire album was over. I think that my early dislike of this album was due to the fact that at the time, I was really in to Dream Theater and I expected heavy-riffing, prog-metal, distorted-fast-paced-guitar solos and all that and was taken aback by this album's quietness. When I finally caught the beauty of this album, I listened to it religiously. My favorite tracks are &quot;Living With the Big Lie&quot;, &quot;Alone Again...&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (notably the Fallen from the Moon section of it), and &quot;Made Again&quot;. But every song is beautiful in their own way. My suggestions for you if you haven't heard Marillion yet, don't start with this album, like I did. Get Season's End or Afraid of Sunlight (two other amazing albums). This one is my favorite from Marillion, though. Also, to add to the Fish vs. Hogarth controversy... in my opinion, both eras are so musically different, it seems unfair to even compare them. I personally prefer the more emotional approach of Hogarth, but Clutching at Straws is a fine album (even though I didn't care for Misplaced Childhood too much). This album will always hold a special place with me.
B000051S3Z|5.0|This movie is hardcore John Wayne at his finest, and terribly authentic. The movie begins with Union Colonel Wayne nervous (with good reason) about a gold shipment during the latter stages of the civil war. He is only nervous about sending it through territory where he knows the famous 1st Louisiana Cavalry is lurking. What follows is absolutely the greatest train robbery in movie history in my opinion. You are left breathless when the hornet nest is sent flying into the boxcar holding the gold. Then John Wayne picks up the chase. Great photography, and it posesses all the ear marks of a Wayne-Hawks western. The plot later in the movie follows along the same lines as previous Wayne-Hawks classics &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and &quot;Eldorado&quot;. Do yourself a favor and add this one to your western collection.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Let me tell you something - how can you rate a movie that was expected form whole world, who is part of a legendary saga that has countless fans, as a dissapointment? Even if Lucas filmed Natalie Portman for two hours I would be pretty satisfied. :) OK, this was stupid (I really like Natalie:)), but try to get my point - Lucas was trying to open a new chapter, not do the evolution of characters or places. Did you expect dark, hard story, or countless emotional moments? I didn`t, and was not dissapointed. Waht we have here is a nice opening of a new triology, a moive with enough action, new stuff and an interesting political (galaxy political, not USA and Russia political :)) story that you can enyoj if you are a fan or not. I admit that I hate Jar-Jar Binks and that some things are too simplified at the moments, but once again, I hope you didn`t expect revolution. Episod 2 is promised to be darker and more complicated, wich is good news and will probably satisfy fans. But, untill then, Episode one is a cool galactial fairy tale made with just enough Lucas magic to NOT dissapoint.
B00005BJPO|4.0|Akira is simply an excellent movie. The attention to detail in the restoration is very good, right down to removing the bits of &quot;dirt&quot; that show up during filming. The picture quality is excellent, and the colors are bright and vivid. The re-mixed sound is excellent as well, even with the new voices. The extras disk includes some great info on almost all aspects of the production. And it's kind of silly, but I was impressed with the collector's tin. It opens up with hinges on both sides, rather than the usual &quot;cookie tin&quot; type.<br />The story itself is a combination of supernatural sci-fi, action, and a little bit of psycology all together in one. It's visually stunning, and sets a dark and intriging vision of the future. The music is top notch, if a bit different. The movie does more than wow you with visuals, but it doesn't force you to think too hard to enjoy it. It's a wonderfull classic to keep on your shelf.<br />I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the new voices. I have no problem with the re-done dialog, they did a good job on that. My problem with the voices is that they don't seem to fit the characters as well (in my opinion). Particularly the 3 &quot;children&quot;. The best way to view the film is with the original Japanese voices. Because they recorded most of the voices before they did the animation, the movement of the mouths is stunning.  But even if it was only in stereo, I would have liked the option for the original English voices. Other than that, no complaints.<br />Bottom line: if your a fan, get this. If you love a good movie, get this. If you love anime, get this. You won't be disapointed.
6305736650|5.0|Some movies just make history - they don`t have to be tehnical perfect or any kind of revolution to become legends. Casablanca is actually a sad fairy tale, dressed in a romance and criminal plot. I don`t want to explain you any part of this story, just see it for yourself. But, I want to ask you one question - when was the last time you heard quotes such as &quot;Play it, Sam!&quot;, or &quot;Here`s looking at you, kid!&quot;, or &quot;This is a begining of a beautiful friendship.&quot; and kept asking yourself where are they from? Well, the answer is - they are from Casablanca, probably the best Hollywood romance ever and the film you will not forget.
0767802659|1.0|I cannot believe how botched up this movie was.  It's based on one of the classic novels of science fiction.  The only resemblence between Heinlein's work and this movie is the title!  Okay, okay, the bugs were there.  But, what about the mechanized armor?!?  Okay, okay, we have to show their smiling faces.  But, we will show a society that has the capability of inter-galatic space travel, but only arm our troopers with mere slug-throwers.<br />Please, please for the love of God, pass this one by.
0385501560|5.0|What else can I say other than it's a sick, vulgar, jive, and hilarious book.  Not many books can fuse all four qualities.  I'm so proud to be Generation X.
B00001OH7V|4.0|I can see why U2 chose to record their 'Achtung Baby' in Berlin's Hansa Studios -- after all, it's the birthplace of 'Heroes,' one of the greatest sounding albums ever made. Too bad the songwriting is not always up to the excellence of the sound, though. Hope I don't offend too many of the faithful out there, but I've got to say the rockers that dominate the first half of this album are weak. &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Joe the Lion,&quot; &quot;Blackout&quot; -- all three boast a spectacular, dense rock'n'roll sound and wonderfully weird lyrics, but the tunes themselves are very average. A shame, because the two ballads (the epic title track and &quot;Sons of the Silent Age&quot;) are gorgeous. The second half of the album is stronger, with a long suite of instrumentals, far superior to those on 'Low.' Plus it has &quot;The Secret Life of Arabia,&quot; which is your favorite song, remember?
B000002NJS|2.0|When I first heard the song Frozen in March of 1998 I thought to myself...What the hell is this?  When the album came out and I actually bought it, I found that the only two songs that I liked were Ray of Light and Mer Girl.  This CD was not Madonna at all, and just another re-invention for her.  She needed people to stll be interested with her so she went to the Spiritual look which definitely is NOT Madonna Ciccone!  This is a bad CD and the songs aren't good.  Erotica is Madonna..Ray of Light is NOT Madonna.  Only buy it if you like a cheap imitaion of Spirituality...
6305508550|5.0|As an MBA student, this movie hits home!  I think Mike Judge has brilliantly captured how idiotic corporate life can be. My favorite part is that Peter can skip work and get promoted to manage as many as ...four people.   Great Laughs!!  Watch it with a friend!
0452282152|4.0|This is a delightful novel.  The story seems to sparkle in the Dutch sunlight of the 17th century.  It contains the characteristics of many great works of literature- symbolism, foreshadowing etc, yet the plot moves along quickly.<br />It helps to be familiar with art of the era (Rembrant and others in addition to Vermeer).  This is a book that can be savored while the art brings it to life.<br />I also appreciated the description of various painting techniques illustrated by the author.<br />This is definately worth your time!
B000002UAR|5.0|This is the greatest and most revolutionary album ever recorded. Anyone who knows anything about music and the beatles will tell you that. Im telling you so. The album keeps a wonderful acid sound right through to the end with Tommorow Never Knows(which i rank as the 4th best Beatles song and therefore the 4th best song ever). Although Rubber Soul was the real turning point for the beatles, this was a much more dramatic declaration to listeners that they were beyond A Hard Days Night. Unfortunetly, most people still had their head in the sand and didnt catch on untill the vastly inferior Sgt Pepper was released. Every cut on Revolver shows that the Beatles were and still are the greatest songwriters ever. My favourite is She Said, She Said, which John wrote about Peter Fonder i believe, at a acid party in LA. As John said - \\"Rubber Soul was the pot album, Revolver was the acid.\\" [....] <br />1966 gave Revolver, the pinnacle of music, to the world.This moment of shining glory makes civilization and the entire pyschedelia movement worthwhile, even if a few [misguided people] still keep preaching about Sgt. Pepper.
B000002UTY|4.0|This live album typifies the great performances by QMS that once was the standard of Bay-Area based groups of the 60s, such as Jefferson Airplane and Spirit.  This performance rocks, with the intro to &quot;Who do you love?&quot; It weakens a bit with &quot;where, how and which do you love&quot; (all continuations of the intro track).  It picks up again with &quot;Mona and Maiden of the Cancer Moon&quot;.  This work was recorded prior to the advent of CDs.  The contents display a &quot;side one and two&quot;  refering to those back disks that we used to be real careful not to scratch.
0671027573|4.0|I enjoyed the book - started reading the book at the gym and before I knew it I was on the bicycle for 50 minutes.  I had not read any of Howard before but I liked her main characters so much I have just purchased another one (All The Queen's Men).
B00001SIES|5.0|I listented to this and all i could think was that this could be a guitar based radiohead, the greatest band ever (well in my opinion). I stumbled apon Muse, and i am glad i did. Fantastic, they are so powerful and that is admirble, and is what is often look for in the cd's that i purchase. The entire album delivers a supreme sound and exceptional lyrics. This band also sound similar to Ours, also a great band, so if you adore Radiohead, or Ours, this is the logical next step to take. I am sooooo glad that i bought this cd. : ) I highly reccomend.
0395951054|1.0|When I was in college, I had a serious case of insomnia, as in not being able to sleep for about 3 days straight.  I went into the library and within reading 60 pages of this tripe, I slept for the next four hours.        It should be known that while Mein Kampf was a big seller during Hitler's reign, almost nobody outside the Party read it, it was so poorly written and obtuse.  It is too bad that people read this crap and try to make its author more than what he was, an extremely lucky, but grossly ignorant man whose philosophy came from the gutters of Vienna and his inspiration from an event (WWI) that should never have happened.  By the way, I hold a history degree which specializes in modern European history, so this is not simply another nay-sayer letter written by someone who has no background.
6305718954|1.0|There aren't enough words in the English language to describe what an atrocious piece of crap this movie is.  To call it a monumental disappointment is an understatement.<br />First of all it was promoted as an \\"Exorcist\\" styled psychological chiller.  Naturally I was psyched to see it based on that but in truth \\"Stigmata\\" is nothing like the \\"Exorcist\\" in story, style, or quality.  After seeing it it was obvious that this comparison was merely a shameless promotional scheme meant to deliberately deceive the viewer.<br />Furthermore, and not the least of its problems, was the casting. Gabriel Byrne was fantastic, as usual, even with the dull material he had to work with.  I swear the guy must be an alchemist but instead of turning lead into gold he achieves the same result with garbage.  Patricia Arquette on the other hand could suck the life out of an Ed Wood production.  She's the only actress I can think of that's guilty of underacting and here she is with top billing!  All the while they had Portia de Rossi in the cast who's an extraordinary and capable actress, despide credits the likes of Ally McBeal and Scream 2, and she's in the movie for less than twenty minutes.  I defy you to find the logic in this.<br />So what we have here is a miserable addition to the \\"end times\\" cadre of films that experienced a mercifully short life in '99.  It had a few chilling visuals but in the end it utterly squandered any potential it may have had.  You can bury this right next to \\"End of Days\\" for all I care.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Given all the recent talent of the classic rock world (Carlos Santana, Claptan, Steeley Dan and Stevie Nicks) who have produced new Albums, I wonder what a current release from Kansas would sound like.   &quot;The best of Kansas&quot; provides a strong indication of how talented this group really was. Although I personally felt that &quot;Point of No Return&quot; was probably one of the bands' most creative albums, this greatest hits compilation is one that every fan should own.  Every song, besides toping the charts, was a reflexion of the thought and insight that true musicians put into their music. From classic tunes like &quot;Carry on my Wayward son&quot;, this album is evidence that Classic rock bands truly viewed their profession as an art form.  This album is a must for those who are committed to the memory and greatness of classic rock.
0345440757|5.0|I love this book and still refer to it weekly now that my son is fifteen weeks old.  This book was given to my husband and me, as a gift when I was six months pregnant.  Out of all the gifts we received this was the most valuable item of them all.  I have since purchased it for other expecting Mothers and hope they find it as useful as we have.   <br />This book is easy reading and Tracy has a cracking sense of humor, which helps when youre expecting.  I found the concepts on feeding and sleeping to be parallel with Gary Ezzos book, On Becoming Babywise, which I happened to follow and have a baby that slept through the night (eight hours) at eight weeks. <br />I found chapter One, Loving the Baby You Gave Birth To, and chapter Three, S.L.O.W. Down (and Appreciate Your Babys Language) the most helpful.  Thankfully I have what she dubs the Textbook Baby, but I am a vibrant and vocal person - chapter One helped me understand I needed to connect with my baby on his language not mine.  Chapter Three made it easier for me to recognize what he was trying to communicate to me so I could respond appropriately.<br />Chapter Seven, The Y  Its Your Turn, was also beneficial as I needed to hear about the importance of rejuvenating myself.  As a self-employed individual, I was used to doing it all, but now that I am a stay-at-home Mom I expect to do it all.  I am a better Mom and much happier when I take time off and let my husband take over for a few hours.  Thank you Tracy for your wisdom and special advice, I know I am a better Mom having read this book!
B00005BJPO|5.0|This is the way all DVDs should be released, with highest video and audio quality. If you are a fan or someone who has never seen this movie, this is the only version to get. The extra material on the second disc and the incredible video restoration Pioneer did with this edition will keep you glued to your TV for a very long time.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Castaway... love it or hate it as a movie, this was a spectacular performance by Tom Hanks.  Too bad his performance couldn't save the movie.  I think that the main problem, lack of direction or closure.  The first half of the movie was great, but I agree with other reviews that a cut away from the island between &quot;I have made fire&quot; and the next section of the movie would have helped the pacing a bit, and the cut wouldn't have been as abrupt.<br />As for the ending.... ah, what can I say.  This will likely go down in history as being among the worst endings in the history of film, and takes the movie down to the 2 star rating.  I can understand the reasoning behind the ending, which is basically to let the audience draw their own conclusion, but we don't need to be beat on the head with a metaphor to get it.  In addition, based on Tom Hank's performance, the audience gets attached to his character, and likely wants to see some closure... and without giving away too much more of an entertaining but disappointing movie, the end of the movie left most everyone I've talked to about it with a big cartoon question-mark above their heads.<br />Bottom line, entertaining, but rent or borrow it, don't bother buying.  It's not a movie you're likely to want to watch more than once.
B00005BJPO|4.0|First off this is the best technical japanese animation you will find. They won't make another like it because it was too much work to create, the fluid motion of the animation is awesome, they didn't cut corners like todays current anime.  This and Prince of Egypt are the best animation you will find on DVD currently.<br />Unfortunately The 1st Movie disc won't play in my player (JVC XV-D701!) So I will have to return the movie.  I was able to see the second supplimental disc, and it was cool, lots and lots of storyboards and other art, well worth it.  And the Trailers, and advertising poster art.  A lot of love was put in to the disc.<br />You can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't seen this movie.  It defines anime, it is how anime should be, bring back the frames of animation per second to this level please!  Princess Monoke just barely comes in on the plus side, there was still some choppy animation at parts, But I can forgive for such a good movie.
0140177396|5.0|The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a really great book. Steinbeck really does great job in describing the area around the farm where it takes place. This story takes place in the mid 1930s to early 40s. He tells of a river flowing from mountains with green trees, and of how the farm looks. The barns where they put the horses and all the crops that they harvest are big ones by the way John Steinbeck describes them.  The story is based on two men from California. They travel with each other and work together to make money. Lennie is a big man who is strong but has mind of a child. He is always getting in trouble at each farm. Then there is George, is a short man who works hard. He more less takes care of Lennie as if he were a big brother to him. George is always telling Lennie about how one day they are going to get their own little place and raise rabbits, horses and chickens. I don't know how they're going to stay alive with the way that Lennie keeps on killing animals. He kills everything he gets. He pets them too hard and he ends up breaking their necks. On the farm where they're going to work there is a man by the name of Curly. He is the boss's son. He doesn't like Lennie from day one. He doesn't like men taller than he is. Of Mice and Men tells the story of two poor laborers trying to get by. They worked all their lives but didn't get a thing from it but trouble. This shows how many families and friends work together to make their dreams come true. Half the time it doesn't work but for some it does. They have the &quot;American Dream&quot; of owning their own farm but that never came true for Lennie and George, although it could have. The novel is easy and understandable. It's not that long and can be read in 3-4 days. The ages that I would recommend it for are 14 to 19. If you would ask me I would tell any one to read this book. I hope to read this book again some day and to read more of John Steinbeck's books too. I would watch the movie after you read the book to compare them to see how much they're alike and how much they're not.read the book to compare them to see how much they're alike and how much they're not.
B00003CX5P|5.0|All too easy to write a bad review on this film.  Far too much expectation is levelled in the direction of George Lucas. And every single person who slates this film will still buy the DVD.  The film is trashed merely because it doesn't live up to expectations.  And it never would have.  The film is George Lucas' vision, and not the collaborative efforts of the millions of fans out there who feel they could do it better.  I hope he does not bow to the masses for the next two, that in itself would be a betrayal.  This DVD has an unprecedented level of extra material, and has probably had the most money spent on it, more so than the T2 Ultimate Edition which incredible expense and effort was invested into.  Completing shots that didn't make it into the final cut is unheard of until now, all too often we are treated to no more than rough cuts and storyboards.  This DVD is made for the fans and for that they should be thankful.  Don't lose sight George.  Not everyone thinks you have lost it.
B00005214X|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece.  31 years after the Beatles broke up, this is still the best solo album.  The music is unbelievable, the change in tempo in all the songs.  The musicianship, the lyrics.  The deep cuts are the best.  George has a lot of Dylan influence in this.  A must buy.
B00004Z459|5.0|i just got this album about 2 weeks ago, and since then, it has been on repeat on my cd player. every song is just beautiful. from the guitars, the beat of them drums, and chester's amazing voice. his singing just sends chills down your spine. its so deep and spiritual...its beautiful. i deffinately recommend that you buy this cd! if you like their songs 'crawling' and 'one step closer', you will love this album. even the slow songs on the album are awesome. you won't be let down.<br />great job guys!! i can't wait for your next album :-)
B000001Y42|4.0|Limp Bizkit's first album: it's the one album that HASN'T been used to refer to them as &quot;sellouts&quot; by complaining fans, and is ultimately the source of all the band's &quot;old school fans&quot;. In many ways, it only makes sense, as Fred Durst raps and roars through subjects in his lyrics that we all must deal with, sometimes in everyday life. Ranging everywhere from the girls in life that end up sticking you over (&quot;Sour&quot;), two-faced people (&quot;Counterfeit&quot;), bothersome fans trying to cop a record deal (&quot;Leech&quot;), and even hateful, irritating neighbors (&quot;Stinkfinger&quot;). All of this was before Durst brought the sensitivity of songs such as &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; and &quot;No Sex&quot; on the band's second album, &quot;Significant Other&quot;. The fact is, this album is purely hardcore, unbridled anger, from a period in time when the band was struggling with all these problems in life, as well as dealing with fame and the other issues that come up from being large in the music genre. No BS on this album.<br />Of course, Limp Bizkit did not revolutionize this &quot;rock-rap&quot; or &quot;nu-metal&quot; genre that has been the basis of a million cop-off bands, all doing the same thing. Rage Against The Machine brought about rapping to hard rock in the mid-90's, which was quickly followed in suit by groups like the Deftones and KoRn. Limp Bizkit, although having very obvious similarities to these groups on &quot;3 Dollar Bill, Y'all&quot;, still managed to keep their style original, combining the interesting guitar work of Wes Borland (who's style has never been the same since this album), and ex-DJ from the group House Of Pain, making rock-rap somehow different again on this album. The biggest standout on the album is the bassist, Sam Rivers, who doesn't get nearly as much recognition as he should.<br />Standout tracks on the CD are found scattered left and right, emphasizing Fred Durst's once good (now terrible) rappingstyle on the autobiographical &quot;Indigo Flow&quot;, to the always mocking of televangelism &quot;Pollution&quot;. Hardcore, loud screams still abound though, on intense tracks such as &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, &quot;Leech&quot;, &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Stalemate&quot;, and &quot;Clunk&quot;. &quot;Faith&quot;, the band's first single from this album, is a fun, interesting take on a George Michael song, but is a bit radio friendly and gets dull after too many catchy listens. The song on this disc that is so rarely recognized, even by the band, but is by far one of their most amazing ones is &quot;Everything&quot;. Spanning nearly twenty minutes, the track wasn't pre-written, and was recorded on the spot. Although most of it is instrumental, it gives off a strange, dark sense of emotion, and the band has yet to write anything to compare to it.<br />If you're just getting into the band now, and were a fan of &quot;Significant Other&quot; or &quot;Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;, you might want to download a few songs first to determine if you'll like this. The rap style is different, and the screaming and rock are more hardcore than the next two albums, but if you can appreciate real talent in a genre that has gotten rather overplayed (&quot;nu-metal&quot;), don't hesitate to get this. It's a great place to start.
B00004T9UF|2.0|...<br />Eminem displays an impressive range and intellect above and beyond his first lp (Slim Shady), improving in general composition-skill and overall confidence, while finding a theme at last (the pain of fame) other than the usual hedonistic musings.  Of course, none of this would mean squat without the beats and melody to back it up, and the crystal-clear production by Dre more than meets this requiem: from the chilling snare on \\"marshall mathers\\" to the ubiquitous Dido guitar/vocal on \\"stan\\" to the funky beeb-bob synth that underscores the chorus of \\"the real slim shady\\"--Dre gives his prodigy a vehicle worth riding.  And Em drives it straight to the bank while rapping about the fragile ties of his surrounding relationships and his overall disgust in being among the ego-driven wasteland of pop celebrity. Good stuff.  The best songs here --Stan, Who Knew, Remember Me, The Way that I am, I'm Back, Marshal Mathers-- are inventive enough in form and flow and music that I'm going to grant this album two stars.  It would have been more, but the vast amount of filler one must wade through to find the diamonds undercuts the rating:<br />Specifically, almost the entire second side of 'Marshal Mathers', where Em's KillKill shtick gets real old real fast.  \\"Amityville\\" is a waste of good music on sub par rhymes of \\"keepin' it real\\" and vulgar misanthropy by Bizarre, while \\"Criminal\\" is just a waste, period.  \\"Kim\\" sounds like Em getting all his demons out on vinyl--sure, but must we have to endure a sickening diatribe to enjoy the pulsing piano and lush orchestration? Dre's talented efforts become hollow under such worthless rants.  And to sum it up--\\"Under the Influence\\"--Em raps about how he doesn't care what we think, because he was (song's title) while writing the song (obviously paraphrased from extreme vernacular).  Sorry, MM, but that's not much of an excuse for mediocrity.<br />I suppose the next album will show us the true level of Eminem as an 'artist'.  If he continues along the path of 'Marshal Mathers', i.e. directionless violent-fantasy rage and few-and-far-between glimpses of power and beauty, he will become another commodity like Britany Spears and Limp Bizkit, a shill for the corporate fat cat.  Get it together, Em.  Write something original, something cool...something _daring_, just for the sake of it!e continues along the path of 'Marshal Mathers', i.e. directionless violent-fantasy rage and few-and-far-between glimpses of power and beauty, he will become another commodity like Britany Spears and Limp Bizkit, a shill for the corporate fat cat.

B000059POY|5.0|As students 34 yrs ago we raved over this film. I haven't seen it since until I found it recently by accident at Amazon. What a surprise!It maintains all the amusement and freshness of a genre that is seldom executed so well in more recent times. To see some of the great actors in their youth again was a real treat.Scandinavian girls were all the rage in the UK in the 60's and no wonder!!!
B00003CY5H|4.0|I knew this movie was going to be good when I saw the cast, and I was right. It was very good. Edward Norton was very good...maybe another Oscar nod, because no other performance, except Hayley Joel Osment, has stood out, yet. Very good movie. Good ending, but slightly predictable. The only problem was they kind of wasted Angela Basset's talent, since she only had a few scenes, but overral a very good movie.
0446310786|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good book.  However, I was forced to read it for school, which I am sure took away from the true excellence of the book.  Even though it was mandantory to read this book, I still enjoyed it, and might even read it again some day.  So, if you are teenager and have not had to read it in school yet... read it now, while you can still fully enjoy it!
B00003CXRM|5.0|What fun.  Great extras on the disk.  Film buffs will not be disappointed.
0688062334|5.0|This was the first book by Diana Wynne Jones that I read. I think I was around 11- 12 yrs old and I just fell in love with it, have been ever since. The following years I read every book published in swedish by this amazing storyteller and I loved every single one of them. <br />I have to say though that Howl's Moving Castle still remains my all time favourite! It's such an amazing book. Sophia and Howl's characters are so charming, funny and just crazy that you can't help loving them. DWJ must have a very vivid imagination, 'cause the plot/story is hilarious! .... and it has such a cute love story. This is simply a must-read-book. Or read anything else she's written 'cause she'll keep you smiling for hours.<br />Just a few weeks ago I was browsing through the shelves in a book store and to my surprise I found a few books in english by DWJ, some of them I hadn't read, so I just had to buy one. It came down to 'Black Maria' which after reading it reminded my why I love her books so much!<br />I haven't read Harry Potter yet, I will soon though. ... hmm.. but I just can't imagine them being as good as Diana Wynne Jones' books (Or Lloyd Alexander, another favourite). I'll just have to see.
0671034065|4.0|Overall this book was fantastic.  The only complaint I have is the development of the romance between Sam and Jaine.  I myself think it could have gone along a little slower, and with more romance - I found that the majority of the attraction was about sex, not love.I would have preferred something a little more pure.      But it was still an extraordinary book, and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be checking out more of Linda Howard's books. I  couldn't put it down! There's some real talent here!
B000000OMB|4.0|Even after 20 years, 7 more studio albums, and unbelieveable personnel changes, this album is, overall, the best output from a truly great band.  I remember the huge impact this album had when it first came out, led by the hits Heat of the Moment and Only Time WIll Tell.  As great as it was then, it has only grown in stature as time has passed.  I don't think there's any band out there today who could make an album like this, and sadly, if someone did, it would never make the charts.  The state of rock music has fallen so far from the days of the early 80's, it's pitiful.  Anyway, along with the two big hit tracks, my personal favorites are One Step Closer and Here Comes the Feeling.  Although, they're all good.  The highlights for me on the album come when the talents of Steve Howe and Carl Palmer are displayed during the long instrumental passages that are liberally sprinkled throughout the album.  All four of these guys showed, however, that it is possible for progressive, intelligent musicians to make music that is accessible to the pop mainstream.  This album is a true classic and a must for every serious rock fan.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is a very nice buy. the best song (as of now) is pushing me away.  this song is very cool.  the whole cd is spam.  and you people that like lp that like limp bizkit, limp bizkit isn't that great. there songs are boring.  linkin park's are not.  linkin park has very original lyrics and very original vocals with both mike and chester singing and mike doing the rap bit.  and they have two dj's and no bassist (which other people have pointed out) which is cool. plus you don't even notice there's no bassist anyway.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|THis album is fantastic. One of the best hard rock albums of all time. When I was 14 years old I heard Ain't talkin about love from my guitar teatcher. I could not get enough of that riff and bought the first Van Halen album. Then I had to buy all the others =)The first album is still the best I think. It's pure hard rock with everything in it, from jazz, blues to punk. Just go out an buy this fantastic cd, no mather what kind of music you like.
B000001EEN|5.0|Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert was a concert organized by his good friend Pete Townshend back in 1973 as Mr. Clapton's first public appearance after a lengthy struggle with a heroin addiction.  The band was full of English rock luminaries including his old Blind Faith pals, Steve Winwood &amp; Rick Grech, Winwood's Traffic mate Jim Capaldi, Ron Wood and Mr. Townshend himself.  The cd reissue is one of the better around as the original album was a truncated version of the show containing only six songs.  The reissue adds eight songs from the show including the first live version of &quot;Layla&quot; ever released in its original form.  The band is a little ragged in spots, probably due to lack of rehearsal time, but they are all pros and the overall sound is superb.  Mr. Clapton plays an invigorated guitar and his voice is suitably course and bluesy.  Versions of &quot;Blues Power&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot;, &quot;Let it Rain&quot; and &quot;Badge&quot; stand out as well as an inspired &quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot;.  This cd is notable for the assemblage of musicians, but the music stands up after all these years.
B000000OXH|5.0|This album followed close on the heels of Asia's monstrously successful debut.  This is just as good, if not better, though.  It's my favorite Asia album, narrowly beating out the debut.  Why?  One song  - Don't Cry.  I never get tired of hearing this song.  It's just plain awesome.  Steve Howe's soaring guitar and John Wetton's voice, combined with the talents of Palmer and Downes, have created what was a milestone in my personal musical education.  The rest of the album doesn't dissapoint, either, although it is not quite as solid as Asia.  My other faves are The Heat Goes On and Open Your Eyes.  I had the cassette of this album in the 80's (actually, I still have it today), and I guess my only disappointment was that the excellent bonus track Daylight got left off the CD (Never really understood Geffen's logic there, the CD had plenty of space on it...)  But, that was recently (and spectaculrly) corrected with the release of The Very Best of Asia in 2000.  A must-have album, and one that will never be away from my CD player for long!
B00005JK93|5.0|Forget Moulin Rouge: Mitchell grabs the American movie musical by its lapels and yanks it phoenix-like from the ash heap in his brilliant cinematic debut! Think the Von Trapp Family Singers meet Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Think the Velvet Underground and Nico as presented by Rogers and Hammerstein. Subversive, hilarious, smart, gorgeous - this summer's first American must-see!
6303617719|5.0|Meg Ryan Cracks me up!! I remember being 14 years old in 8th grade and going to the theaters 3 times to see this. I have the video since.....and recently got it on DVD. I love the soundtrack!! Excellent movie, Kevin Kline's french accent is hilarious and SO NATURAL. Meg is the typical Meg....funny and the bickering that goes on between the two. HIGHLY RECOMEND!!  I have been a fan of Meg since Joe Versus the Volcano
B000002G85|4.0|Eric Clapton's debut solo release is loose and bluesy effort that has the feel of an extended jam session with friends.  In fact, many of his friends do play on the album including Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Stephen Stills and other.  The contains Mr. Clapton's definitive version of J.J. Cale's &quot;After Midnight&quot; as well as other blues driven numbers like &quot;Bottle Of Red Wine&quot;, &quot;Lonesome &amp; A Long Way From Home&quot; and &quot;Lovin' You, Lovin' Me&quot;.  Mr. Clapton's guitar playing is crisp and his voice expressive.  The best cut on the album is the closer, &quot;Let It Rain&quot;, that contains a ripping guitar solo and a strong vocal performance.  A solid debut from a man who already had accomplished so much.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Francis ford coppola created one of the most thrilling movies of all time during the time of 1972 &amp; 1974. With his love of filmmaking he set the rules and showed how it was possible to make a stunning experience in the theaters. Actors like De niro, Pacino, Keaton and Talia Shire dont make the movies less bad. The Godfather collection will echo thru eternity, theres no doubt about that...
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake - the music that rocks the ground. If you haven't heard it, you simply must do. The sound is clean, it's raw (souns almost uneditet) and using the trumpet as part of the band, thats just genious! The vocalpart is extreme! I think the best way to describe this will be: I bought the record, and brought it to a party. Five minutes after the music was played, my CD was stolen. So I bought it again, three months later it was stolen again. Third time bought, it was stolen yet one more time. Now I've placed my 4th order for the same CD... I SIMPLY MUST HAVE IT!
B0000041Z6|2.0|Solti's version of Mahler's cycle of simphonies is a poor one. Only the 1st and 8th symphonies are worthy of being considered as references. The second, third, and fourth are auwful conducted by Solti. The fourth has an horrible blunder in the Adagio which avoid any kind of enjoyment of the whole simphony and the fifth is unbalanced and not victorius, as required (the last movement being strident and unbearable). The 6th and the 7th are common versions (the first movement of the seventh unbalanced) and the ninth is definitively pitiful. The great music of Mahler seem a botched job under Solti's gaze.<BR>Do not waste your money. Just save for Bernstein's versions (DG preferably) or buy each simphony following the indications below (Bernstein is the best in the whole cycle excluding the 7th simphony where Klemperer succeeded in the higuest degree)<BR>1st. and 8th - Solti (8th Kubelik too) 2nd- Klemperer 3rd- Kubelik 4th- Barbirolli, Haitink 5th- Barbirolli, Dohnanyi 6th- Neumann 7th- Klemperer 9th- Chailly, Sinopoli 10th- Chailly, Rattle (this simphony is not included in Solti's CD set)<BR>If you dont want to spend a lot of money and you prefer a cycle, look for Kubelik or Haitink.

0780626494|5.0|This is one of my favorites, i don't what it is but it just brings a smile to your face when your watching. The stars really make this a great movie because the idea is silly , a man is born in a fallout shelter when his inventer dad back in 1962 takes his wife under ground after a nuke scare (but it turns out to be a plane that hit their house not a nuke!) then 35 years later the now grown up boy goes above ground to find out what is left of the wold after the nuke hit...he just wants a non-mutant wife! anyway it's a good funny movie pulled off well by all.
B000059XYL|5.0|I thought &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; was a really good movie.  I had never seen Piper Perabo before and was really impressed.  My favorite parts of the movie were the music and dance.  The choreography was amazing.
B00005LKIM|1.0|This much anticipated film with everything you could have, A good story setting, great new characters, Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Ridley Scott directing, and Steve Zaillian who wrote the script, the movie failed completely.  How do you ask.  No idea.  You had excellent principal settings being Hannibal Lecter living in Italy, Clarice Starling about to lose her job because of a raid on a drug dealer, a corrupt Italian policeman trying to find Hannibal Lecter, and a maimed victim of Hannibal Lecter searching for him.  The movie is just terrible.  When I went to the theatre I just instantly thought the movie would be awesome, because I waited in line for an hour, but in my mind.  NO WAY!  When I found out Jodie Foster wasn't playing in the sequel I was a disappointed, then I saw the movie and I realized how come she didn't.  And now that I have seen it I am thrilled she didn't play in the sequel.  If you like gore and action feel free to watch but if you like more of a psychological thriller don't waste your time.  And if you saw The Silence of the Lambs (See my review) you won't want to watch this one.  Silence of the Lambs was perfect.  This can't even relate.  Not only to the the Silence of the Lambs, but also to the book.  The book is excellent, masterfully written,  the ending is just absolutely perfect.  However, unfortunately these two, well how do you put it.  They can't even be compared.  I wish the whole movie could be changed.  I just hope the new upcoming movie Red Dragon will be much better.  And hopefully Ted Tally will write it.  The book Red Dragon was excellent.  So lets hope that Red Dragon will be better than Hannibal.
B00005BJPO|3.0|First, I'd like to say that I do have the original VHS tape to Akira, and I loved it.  I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  But as I watched it, I did not know of the new dubbing that they did for this new DVD, and I was dissapointed, what I want to know is...why didn't they keep the old english version!! And they just had to make it widescreen!! Luckily however...they had Japanese subtitles.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone if you like Japanese, and subtitles, but I would not recommend it to anyone who loved the english dub, or don't like widescreen versions for you are wasting your time, money and killing your ears.
1878424319|5.0|I do not like books that tell me how to think or what to do, but I look for books that help me by giving me tools to better live my life with the gifts God has given me.  This book is full of so much common sense, that I was almost embarassed after I read it because I should have thought of it all myself.  Incredibly logical and inspirational.  It truly helped to keep me focused during some very tough times.  I learned how to handle others negative opinions of my situation and constant critism from my boss without becoming upset with them or myself. This could not have come at a better time.

IF IT WEREN'T FOR PRIEST, VAN HALEN, AND OF COURSE BLACK SABBATH THE METAL SOUND OF THE 80'S-PRESENT WOULD NOT BE THE SAME! BUY THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH EVERY PRIEST ALBUM!

B00004XPPK|5.0|Though Rita Hayworth's sultry performance steals each scene in which she's featured, it is overall an excellent movie.  Never before or since has a femme fatale been portrayed with such smoldering passion and such deep character flaws as Hayworth's Gilda.  Combine her potency with a plot involving an illegal gambling operation with plenty of shady characters ~ in fact, every character has an ulterior motive and a secret ~ and you have a film that, after 60 years, is still fascinating to watch.
B000004286|3.0|I purchased this CD based on the strength of the reviews posted here, since I haven't yet seen the movie.  However, from the first listen to the most recent I can't share the enthusiasm that others have shown for it.  Maybe this is based upon how for others it recalls scenes in the film, but on its own it does not seem to posses real musical character.  The bagpipes sound electronic and weak.  But there is a simplicity and subtlety, and certainly is not unpleasant listening.  For comparison, some really good scores for me are 13th Warrior, Conan the Barbarian, and Empire Strikes Back.  This one is not there.

6303201954|4.0|A mysterious cloud drifts across space - passing through Klingon territory - on a direct course for Earth.  First vaporizing a trio of Klingon battlecruisers, the cloud similarly dispatches a peaceful Starfleet outpost.  Frantic officials of the United Federation of Planets scramble to meet the cloud, which is apparently some sort of spaceship housing aliens, origins unknown.  Only one starship is in position to intercept the cloud before its arrival on Earth - the USS Enterprise.  Unfortunately, the Enterprise hasn't completed an extensive re-fitting, and barely anything works.  Kirk isn't even in command (though that changes quickly).  Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock is in the middle of a refit of his own.  Having cast off Starfleet, Spock embraces Vulcan meditation that will free him from his emotional human-half.  Before he can complete the transition, he receives a mental cry from space - a confused plea that he can scarcely understand but one he can trace to the heart of the mysterious cloud.  Having no choice, he leaves Vulcan to rejoin Starfleet.<br />This film took a lot of lumps from those, unlike Trekkies, who weren't willing to forgive any film that had nothing more than an uninteresting plot, some good FX and the name \\"Star Trek\\" (most would have preferred to start the franchise with something like Wrath of Khan\\").  The plot is thin and turns out to have been borrowed from an episode of the original series - \\"The Changeling\\".  Much of the film is slow and whole sequences amount to an excuse to show off the special effects and other aspects of the cinematographic look which both excel over the 60's campiness of the show.  The characters don't play as much with their older TV selves' persona as they would in the latter movies and most of the time, they're passive observers of an immense alien intelligence - unable to do anything to help Earth.<br />Yet this Trek is special - mostly because it was the first and could have set a worse tone for the sequels, butalso because it created a futuristic look which was neither that of the clean and high-tech future of the old-style movies, nor the gritty and junky style of movies like \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\".  The Enterprise here is a masterpiece of technical design, but the film's makers show its faults (an horrific and fatal transporter accident; wormholes; very narrow hallways)  It's more streamlined than its TV version, but not so carefree looking that it's a cruise ship like the Enterprise-D.  As the Enterprise accelerates into warp space, you can almost feel the throb of the engines vibrate through your TV.  The characters are appropriately serious yet show that glimmer of their campier selves (\\"Spock, so help me I'm actually glad to see you!\\").  Even the danger's of space seem more palpable here than on the show (or any of the shows).  Though a rip-off of an older episode, real Trekkies know this as a common occurrence, and the movie actually kept me guessing until the last 10 minutes as to the identity of the aliens and their mission.  Even the special effects seem still fresh, despite the passge of over 20 years (and a switch to \\"Industrial Light Magic\\" after this movie).  With its emphasis on a mysterious alien and the dangers of space, this is perhapos the closest any trek has come to pure science fiction.  Perhaps the new show \\"Enterprise\\" will finally match the promise offered by this first movie.

0553274503|5.0|Charly is a touching movie that I recommend, but the book about the rise and fall of Charlie is far better, in part because of the stunning second half that the movie does not address. I did not want to let go of this book anymore than Charlie of his intelligent life. We go through the awareness, love and sadness of Charlie, and it isn't obvious what he and we are left with.
0425180638|5.0|I've always found Kay Scarpetta somewhat straight up and down, or buttoned up too tightly, but in TLP, we get to see a more emotional side of her that makes me like this series even more.<br />We finally get to see how she coped with Benton Wesleys death, and how her relationships have always fared badly because of who she is.  I felt that the future novels and the characterisations will be stronger for this insight into Kay's character.<br />I was getting bored with Kay, but now she has piqued my interest again.

0525457585|5.0|I know this book is mainly for young adults, but it shouldn't be limited to just them. I've been a fan of the movie since before I can remember. I only picked up the book about three years ago, and I'm still amazed by how profound this book is. Aside from the loveable characters and their adventures you have a whole hidden (but not so hidden) message about how we treat ourselves. Should a young adult pick up on that? Besides, what an awesome way of telling a story. Having the first letter of every Chapter make the alaphabet! The story is about a story within a story, within a story, and then it makes you wonder if your standind in a story as well? Ah, what a trip! All I know is no matter what the age, this is a must read. It was like my bible through high school, as twisted and corney as that sounds.
0812550706|4.0|I really liked Ender's Game. There were some parts which just made you so mad..which was a good thing..lol. The author truly made you feel what Ender was feeling in the book. It was incredible.      However, even though &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; is *not* in the Ender's Series...I think that had the best view of everything. I read both &quot;Ender's Game&quot; as well as &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; at the same time and it was well matched. However, I think Bean's POV in Ender's Shadow had a more simpler way of explaining the complicated parts. Not that I'm saying Bean's simple. Lol. He's anything but. I really like Bean and Ender. They are both really, really well explained and they're very real.       Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite Sci-Fi writers and I recc. anything he has written or will write.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Who ever said `No Code is Pearl Jam's weirest album needs to go back and take a look at `Vitalogy'. From front to back the packaging, the book and the Cd this is by far Pearl Jam's most experimental album, No Code is merely a more mellow album. Songs like `Hey foxy.....' and `Bugs' are some of Pearl Jams strangest but somehow Stone, Jeff, Mike and Eddie keep their songs alive by making sound a little different.<br />Perhaps to of the best songs of the album are the similarly titled `Nothingman' and `Betterman' both begin as slow ballads but where `Nothingman' progresses into a wonderful emotional experience, `Betterman' takes a turn to a louder style which differentaites both songs and indeed gives the album some variety.<br />Fan's will never forget songs like `Corduroy' and `Immortality' from this album which are true Pearl Jam classics, both of which do a great job in exploiting Pearl Jam's developement since `Ten'. An album of experiement that was certainly worth the risk, the hardcore fans of Pearl Jam snapped this one up whilst some newcomers stayed away.# Despite it's ability to seemingly show up or better each song with the next, the final track somehow seems to lose the plot.<br />Despite this being a venture into new lands Pearl Jam seems right at home from start to end, Vedders ode to Lp's `Spin The Black Circle' is also ope of the albums noticable high points. If you don't have `Vitalogy' yet, go out and by it, or better still click this window and order it now, It is most certainly a great album and one of Pearl Jams best.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Yes, this is a movie about addiction. No, this is not a movie about substance abuse. Internalize this distinction before you watch it, or write a review about it. Aronofsky isn't moralizing about the perils of smack; he's commenting on the industries, legal and otherwise, that thrive by promising dreams they can't deliver, and on the eventual collapse of lives built around those promises. This is not &quot;drugs are bad, mmmkay?&quot;; it is something far deeper and broader, and to pan it -- or praise it -- as anti-drug propaganda is to miss the point entirely.<br />See this movie. It will hit you like a kick in the stomach, but it will make you a better person.
B0000027RL|5.0|Whether people like it or not grunge died with Kurt Kobain as did Nirvana, Bands like Nirvana &amp; Pearl Jam were solely responsible for the rise of grunge in the early 90's with albums like `Nevermind' and `Ten'.<br />Upon `Ten's' release it is no secret that it did not sell as well as most top line music, but with the release of `Nevermind' Pearl Jams album `Ten' (and Nevermind) skyrocketed both bands to fame. And by doing so made the respective front men `Eddie Vedder' and Kurt Kobain gods.<br />However unlike Nirvana's `Nevermind' album (which `Ten' went on to out sell) `Ten' make a fantastic change from traditional rock music, in all senses `Ten' is a musical milestone. Whether it be the beautiful love/tragedy song `Black' or the bands most recognised song `Jeremy' a true 90's classic, the fact that this album was never intended to be as successful as it was, is it's genius. Somehow each track keeps itself fresh without ever sounding like something before it, and 10 years on it still sounds every bit as fresh and makes rival bands such as `STP' seem dismal and boring in comparison.<br />Do your self a favour and by this album, you will not regret it, If your an existing/long-time Pearl Jam fans and don't have this album then I suggest that you go out and buy it now. Newbies will love it as well, as long as you like either rock music or grunge then you will love and `need' Pearl Jam's `Ten'.
0140067477|4.0|A nice introduction to eastern philosophy and a good read for those seeking wisdom. In a modern society filled with superficial standards, noise polution and electronic everythings, this book is a welcome break that may just affect the ways you think and react.  I also love and highly recommend the &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; book of wisdom by Taro Gold which, like the Tao of Pooh, teaches that life is not about what happens to us, it's how we perceive what happens.  Wonderful!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is (whether you like it or not) Pearl Jam's most disliked album and it is easy to see why, some of the songs have a much darker mood than PJ anthems of the past I.e `Dissident'. The Cd's main and arguably best song is `Nothing as it seems' a fantastic and somewhat dark song with some odd lyrics but without a doubt a Pearl Jam classic. The rest of the songs can be easily avoided but by doing so you would be making a grave mistake, The first two tracks put Pearl Jam on a return to form of sorts, as they hit you with two short but certainly sweet, fasted paced songs. `Breakerfall' and `God's Dice' begin the album well but as I mentioned are not like PJ anthems of the past.<br />A lot of people have complained about Eddie Vedders wonderful song `Soon Forget' for being short and not really a song, these `fan's' seem to have forgotten why Pearl Jam are so good in the first place, and that is there versatility. They have the ability to try new things for better or worse, the album itself is a great listen for PJ fans and a good rock Cd for new fans.<br />The albums main problem is it's lack of progression from previous albums, although musically their sound has changed greatly and no two songs ever sound the same. This album is especially good for live songs, songs like `Evacuation' seem as though they have been written for a live audience, with a repeated fist in the air riff. It also shows just how much the band have changed since `Ten', Eddie sounds<br />better than ever and so do the band so no worries their but the new sound that keeps PJ from growing old may be a little too different for long time fans.<br />All in all, some PJ fans may not like this outing but in all honesty this album is once again a fantastic display of what Pearl Jam have to offer, and ten years later they show no signs of slowing down. In conclusion love Eddie, live Pearl Jam and listen to `Binaural'.
0783107986|5.0|Awesome videotape footage of battle sequences, particularly the monumental Battle of Stalingrad.  Not much discussion as to why the war took place, rather, a video and audio accounting of the actual events of the war.  Interesting interviews w/ the notorious Alger Hiss, Robert Oppenheimer.  I'm not sure why Jimmy Stewart was talking to us about bomber formations, but he does a credible job.  Stephen Ambrose in his hippy/preppy look, gives most interesting discussion on the aftermath of the war, although he has a tendency to talk like Donald Duck.  Hitler comes across as the schmuck that he really was.  No discussion at all of the mass executions in Russia.  1 segment on the Holocaust, but well done.  A very European perspective on the war.  Eerie footage of the dropping of the atomic bombs and informative interview w/ the mission commander (Tibbett).  The radiated Japanese guy's bubbling back was truly disgusting.  Olivier just perfect in the narrative role.  The Japanese are portrayed as animalistic fanatics who would rather die than surrender or admit a mistake.  Tojo sounds like a sushi chef that I once met.  Hey, this stuff is awesome.  The French are portrayed as inept boobs, while the Brits are portrayed as heroic (you guessed it, this was a British production).  I like it...
B000059GEH|4.0|Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe &amp; Betty Grable are highly entertaining in this tale of models who set out to land a millionaire.  Not having any of their own money, they come up with some off the wall schemes to live the lifestyle they are dressed for! All 3 are gorgeous and funny to watch. Each does a great job of playing the quirkiness of their characters.  This is a timeless classic that's as appealing today as it was in it's day.  A great girly movie.  Lauren Bacall has a flair for humor that is delightful to watch.
B00000J6AG|5.0|When I first got this CD I didn't know what to expect, because I had only heard one Moby song. But when I first started listening to it I couldn't take off my headphones because every song on this CD is so great. <br />My favorites on this CD are &quot;Body Rock&quot;, &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;South Side&quot;, &quot;Natrual Blues&quot;, and &quot;Run On&quot;. But don't get me wrong, every song is good.<br />Buy this CD, it's a must have.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This album is my entire last relationship in one condensed package. Dido has my thoughts in her mind and puts them to song. I could never express myself as beautifully as she has done. Thank the heavens above for letting me hear her beautiful voice when I need her the most. My lfe will never be the same &amp; I owe it all to Dido &amp; my former girlfriend. <br />Here's the songs:  Track 2 is what I believe that my lover was thinking in her last days with me. Track 1 is how I felt after I was alone. Track 3 was when I believed that she must have found someone better. Track 4 is when I have resigned myself to the fact that YES, IT IS DEFINITELY OVER &amp; SHE'S NOT COMING BACK!! Track 5 reminds me of how we slept so soundly together &amp; what she could be potentially missing by leaving me &amp; not loving me anymore. Track 6 is trying to remember all the good things that had happened &amp; how she made me feel. Track 7 is how I usually feel, you know: dejected &amp; alone. And so on and so on. The only song that gives me any hope is Track 12, &quot;Take My Hand&quot; I hope that the truth will come out and that she'll believe in me again...............<br />please forgive the ramblings of a heartbroken, love-sick, lesbian music fan who is now in the murky depths of soul-searching her very existence upon this earth....maybe someday I'll see that giant orange ball of flame in the sky.....until then...I'll just keep my purple shades in the glovebox.....please buy &amp; enjoy the CD

630575067X|3.0|Well, I came in and read a few reviews, none over 3 stars sadly.  When I started reading the one star reviews I was immediately ready to disregard anything they said.  But, after I read the whole thing, I saw the points they made, and actually, they were really good points.  In Star Wars, we have an all powerful evil we have to destroy of it will soon take over the galaxy.  The Death Star is destroyed, much to the relief of everyone by Luke Skywalker.  In the Empire Strikes Back, the same evil is back, and this time the evil wins, and Han Solo is lost to Jaba.  In Return of the Jedi, the Death Star is back, and supposedly it is \\"out of order\\" but as we find out it is \\"Very operational\\".  Again it is destroyed by our good friend Lando, and everything turns out for the best.<br />Then, we go back to the beginning.  We have an evil force, but it's not so big and it's not so bad.  Most of this movie takes place on land, not in space where we all hoped, and even some underwater.  We meet Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker, and he sure does need to take some acting classes.  George Lucas's best accomplishment is finding out how to make young Anakin into an older Anakin, and a different actor.<br />... It had no plot, and it gave the watchers what they wanted, action.  \\"Breakthrough\\"?  I think not, the plot in the last 3 films was what made us watch this movie, and sadly you left us wanting more.  I'm not devestated, it's just a movie, and I will watch it again, because let's face it, that light sabre scene at the end was just awesome, the fight choriography was great.  The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is for the action and the past.  I'm sure the final film in 2005 will be the best, it has to be.<br />Mark_Sigel
B00005IBGQ|4.0|One in a million is ole Rufus and here his sound is a little snappier, a little sharper. The music-hall edges and Cole Porter style swagger are still present but in clearer focus. His debut was terrific, don't get me wrong, but I feel that with extended airplay this grower gives a little more. Highly recommended for all intelligent songwriters out there..
B0000029GA|5.0|WOW, I can't say to much NAS Ripp's the mic on this joint. 2 words GET IT!! A Must for all hiphop fans. I am out 1
B000002L9J|5.0|to write a review on this album is pointless, but since some already have i might as well contribute a review. this album influenced some many people growing up in the 80's and 90's. no matter what kind of music you like, we could all relate and appreciate this great album. i hold this album is the greatest smiths album, but then it's very hard to argue against the rest. it's obviously my favorite, and i doubt i will ever enjoy one as much. with classic tracks like there is a light, i know it's over, queen is dead, etc, it's definitely the apex so don't even waste your time reading reviews when you could be listening to this album. if you don't have money get some now!, check under couches, beg people you know and on the streets, and get put together the cash so you can enjoy a piece of music perfection.
B00000IAU3|5.0|what can I say, this must be the music god wants to hear.
B00003CY5H|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's a plot that didn't interest me (they had about 3 plots running at the same time.....guy in a scam for the money, another guy falling in love, and the same guy trying to pay off his debts) While Norton did a good job of playing a guy who acts ..., De Niro hasn't changed....he's still boring and I don't find him such a great actor.....his movies don't interest me but I saw this one since I heard good things about it....I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.....the only good scene was the last one but the rest is all dialogue and useless scenes....don't waste your money.
0380817683|5.0|Marian Keyes took me on a voyage to the unknown.  I had no idea what this novel was about as I purchased it based solely on the high quality of work always generated by Ms. Keyes.  Ms. Keyes takes us through journey of a drug addict in denial and onto the road of recovery.  <br />Rachel Walsh was a party girl, she loved to go out, to be seen with the right people and have a good time drinking and drugging but of course Rachel doesn't realize she had a problem until she overdoses on pills and is sent to the hospital to have her stomach pumped.  The one constant in her life (family) becomes involved and has her admitted to a drug treatment facility known as The Cloisters in Ireland which Rachel conceives as a vacation and a place where famous people go to relax.  Rachel comes in contact with a variety of individuals with problems, alcoholics, overeaters and drug addicts but Rachel believes her stay at this facility to be a vacation as she doesn't have a drug problem.  <br />Rachel learns through brutal counseling that she indeed has drug problem and when Ms. Keyes takes us step by step into this powerful journey and we all see the extent of Rachel's problem and her journey to recovery.  When Rachel is released from this facility she has a few set backs but with the support of family, friends and of course drug users anonymous she discovers she is a fighter and gains back all the things she has lost through drug abuse, her friends, her job, her boyfriend and most importantly her life.<br />Once you complete this novel you'll find yourself cheering for the girl who went through hell and back.  This is a must read as I for one could not put it down until its conclusion.  I loved it and so will you.
0446677450|5.0|OK, you've read the editorials, and maybe some of the other reviews here. I have a comfortable income, but from a single source, and am starting my own business, and I found this book fascinating and very useful. The author believes understanding and education (not necessarily of the school variety) are key elements if one seriously wants to become wealthy: if you are looking for specific details on what to do, when and how, you will be disappointed. The book does not advocate one particular way to earn money, tho the author uses some examples from his own experience of buying real-estate.  This book is not &quot;Finance For Dummies&quot;. It doesn't even have an index. The book is part narrative: it tells the story of how the author learned from his rich &quot;Dad&quot;. The rich Dad sounds like an excellent teacher, probably better than the author, whose writing style is a little flat. Being a teacher myself, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about how rich Dad taught his 2 &quot;kids&quot;, and I agree with Kiyosaki's approach to learning and teaching. Not being a big business owner or high-flying investor, I cannot vouch for the financial details in the book. However, I think it does a great job of pointing out the fact that &quot;financial literacy&quot; is just as important and vital as &quot;computer literacy&quot;: one is taught in school, the other isn't. It also does a great job of starting to teach me (hate math, no good with figures) about financial literacy: I appreciated the simple language and the diagrams (OK some of the narrative is a little hokey). The present economic climate has outgrown the old reality of &quot;get a good education, a stable job with good benefits and you're all set.&quot; For me, it was a wake-up call. I immediately bought the other 2 in the series, and I want to try the game. I don't think this  book is just a scam to get rich: if it was, I think Kiyosaki would have made sure his book is a success by spending a lot more on advertising than he actually did - almost nothing.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is studio perfection. It sounds better as one song than ten tracks. It introduces and it concludes brilliantly. Its dabbling in samples and electronics finally establish the rules for electronic music as an artform.<br />It all starts with &quot;Everything in its Right Place.&quot; The all electronic opener is a great way to start a departure from a past. When you're coming off a &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; or &quot;Karma Police&quot; high, this brings you to the hell of being sober.<br />The album plays through as tracks like &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; or &quot;Optimistic&quot; express intense moods of out-of-body experiences and hope. Meanwhile the radio-friendly and upbeat &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; indulge in the rock and dance they obviously picked up while being contained for three years in a studio.<br />To close the album, &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; offers an angelic departure, a death of sorts, to the music. The ending line, &quot;I will see you in the next life,&quot; sums it up perfectly. And just to show the meaning of this line further, the music comes back as a hidden track, playing out like a grand finale before the electronic garble fades again into the dark silence. Reincarnation of the music is promised, and a new beginning is what ends this album.<br />The most refreshing part of this album is that, with all the crap that's being released today, albums that you could tell were made in little under a month, this album sounds like it took years to perfect. It also sounds like it's not just the effort of one guy, but an entire band and the humongous effort can be heard in each track.<br />To me, it is no surprise this album debuted at #1. Tracks leaked onto Napster, and anticipation in both the UK and US was feuled by critical reviews of the album. It certainly will not be the best Radiohead album to everyone, but if listeners judge the music by its inner focus and melody over substance, then this will be one of the best albums they'll ever find.
6305428298|4.0|Jane Horrocks, Ewan McGregor, Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn and Jim Broadbent conspire in a northern coastal English town to spin a neat little tale. Jane Horrocks has a remarkable talent, as both a singer and a mimic, and I wanted to stop the movie several times and just listen to her do her stuff more. Brenda Blethyn is hilarious, and it's not just because the script-writer is excellent: a motor-mouth with a razor wit and heartful of disappointment just below the surface; a comic in  the great tradition of Julie Walters. I wished Ewan McGregor had a  bigger part, but then he's the silent counterpart to Little Voice. My only criticism is that the last part of the movie is a little too conceptual: we're obviously meant to feel that Little Voice has gained a great freedom (all the references to Judy Garland, bluebirds, etc), but I didn't feel that I had actually SEEN that. Little Voice's  attachment to her father is almost disturbing, and although it's meant to be a happy, feel-good ending, I couldn't help feeling anxious for Ewan McGregor's character - will he ever be able to make up for her missing, saintly Dad?<br />If you liked this movie, especially Brenda Blethyn, check out &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Right. My first review ever. Yeay for me. <br />I'm gonna deal with the dissappointing stuff first, in order to end on a lighter tone.<br />Dissappointing: <br />- Lack of story-line. The first three movies (I refuse to think of this movie as Star Wars 1. The original is part 1 in my book) were following a closely interwoven story-line. I was expecting this movie to add to that. Build up characters, and start with the basics. It did, in a way, but I was expecting more of it.<br />- Annakin. I'm amazed this kid lived to his age. He's way too annoying. &quot;Yeah&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot;. He says that modern-kid stuff way too often. Mom COULD have drowned him when he was younger. But nooo.<br />- Jar Jar. Leave this double jar on the shelf. &quot;How rude&quot;. How I'd love to grab him by that big neck of his, and tie his ears around it. 'Nuff said.<br />- Commerce. We all saw what commerce was when the first (See? Told you I didn't regard this one as the first) 'trilogy' was released. Thing is: Everybody who saw the older Star Wars movies and loved them is now older. Yet this movie was totally made for kids. (See JarJar and Anakin). We, the true old-timer (25 IS old) fans would buy the toys anyway. Heck, we have tons more cash to spend then 22 years ago. No need to have made them so annoying that we'd prolly end up tossing them out the window or hand rags over them to keep from gagging. Everything looks like it's sweet and huggable. We know kids are little adults, but they forget about the adult kids... <br />But, there's some good things in the movie too.<br />Awesome:<br />- The fight. Like another reviewer said: &quot;The best action ever on TV&quot;.<br />- The Special-effects. I sometimes wonder when we definatly won't be able to tell the difference between something 'real' and something 'computer-made'. Some of them are a bit overdone, but overall, I'd say the line &quot;Where's my jaw?&quot; pretty much sums it up.<br />- Extras. This DVD is packed with them.Kudos to Lucasfilm for that.<br />- 1/3. Seeing this is the first one of the new trilogy (Ha. did it again!), maybe the Lucasfilm team will listen to all the negative reviews, and think about their long-term fans a little more next time. Granted, the first (!!) three movies were ALSO aimed for kids and commerce, but at least adults also got enjoyment. Now, I think most of the adults were trying to hold down their lunch because of all the sweet kiddie-stuf. AND we'll get to see more of Natalie Portman. (I vote we get full close-ups of her and Anakin going at is!). <br />- Mace Windu. YEAY! Samuel L. Jackson rules!<br />- This is not the end. For two reasons. 1. It's only a movie. My life won't end; I'll just watch the old three (Ha!) movies again and again and again. 2. There's two more to come up. Lucas can make up for this one, plus we'll get more of the storyline.<br />Tip for Star Wars 5: Get Gary Oldman!
0790742780|2.0|This movie is supposed to be about righteous indignation. Douglas's character wants to walk down the street without being hassled. He wants to buy a can of pop without being ripped off. He wants civility, common courtesy, common sense and a little freedom and when he's had enough, he fights back!<br />Yeah, it's a bit of a cheap and manipulative setup, but it works, at least for a while. The movie might have been something special had it followed its original course to completion. <br />But in the end, the Douglas character is no hero. He is not fighting for the Everyman, for decency, for respect. He is simply an abusive control freak who has a temper tantrum because he's having a bad day. He'd rather kill himself and leave his daughter fatherless than deal with the annoyances and indignities that are germane to being an adult resident on the Planet Earth. What a pointless waste.<br />The film teases with social commentary and then backs away. It stirs up the audience with Douglas as \\"righteous warrior\\" and then abandons him in the end as a pitiful, irresponsible, abusive weakling. Why? <br />\\"Falling Down\\" ultimately does exactly that: It falls down with a thud.

0399143904|3.0|It seems that Tom Clancy's most recent novels don't measure up to his older stories. Unfortunately, Rainbow Six seems to continue that trend. The slow pace, pathetic character development, and silly main plot prevent this book from being on the same level as his earlier novels.<br />Without a doubt, the biggest flaw in the story is the virtually non-existant character development. The best example of this is the Rainbow squad members. I know that it's hard to give individual personalities to twenty or so different characters, but that isn't a good enough excuse to explain their total lack of develoment. They are prety much typical military stereotypes, with next to no background or personal information given about them. At the very least, I would expect Clancy to pay some attention to Ding Chavez, seeing how important he is to the story, but he also doen't have much in the way of personality. John Clark fares slightly better in this department than the other members of the squad, retaining the same personality that Clancy fans have come to love. The best character in the book is Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, the cunning former Russian KGB agent, who is extremely greedy but still has something of a conscience. On the other side, the major villians of the story, like the Rainbow squad, suffer from lack of development, as they aren't even fully introduced until near the end of the book. For me to understantd their motivations and their ambitions, they needed to have a more deal of screen time. The end result was the shoddily developed villians you saw.<br />The slow pace is another culprit. Most of the book's 897 page lengh is annoying filler material which should have been edited out. The pace picks up during last two hundred pages, but it's too late to sve the rest of the book. There aren't enough action sequence to fill the entire book. Also, the main plot is rather silly. A group of enviromentalists who want to save the world by killing the entire human population? Idon't need to explain just how ridiculous that is...<br />But the book isn't a total failure. The action parts were well-written, if a little bit predictable. There were alo some other parts of the book that held my interest, like many of the scenes with Popov. Altogether, the book has some nice action sequences and some interesting scenarios, but the book just wasn't as good as I've come to expect from Tom Clancy...
0201633612|5.0|If you have been in the software development for a while you will find that the patterns described in the book are very familiar. I also found the structure diagram of the patterns very helpful. Anyone serious about software development needs this book on his or her bookshelf. This book isn't an introduction to object-oriented technology or design. This book assumes you are reasonably proficient in at least one object-oriented programming language, and you should have some experience in object-oriented design as well.   The book is a classic in object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of the code.<br />Highly recommended! <br />....

B000058983|5.0|If you have never heard of Love I can't blame you. They never really made a huge national impact, and their songs aren't played on the radio. I personally stumbled upon this piece de resistance while rummaging through a bargain bin; I still can't believe it! Pulling you in and never letting go, this often melodic and shimmering album tells a tale of the world in the 1960's as lived by one Arthur Lee. Never heard of him either? Well, he was friends with Jimy Hendrix, and did have his own band throughout the 70's, but here, he was in peak form. Guitars and violins never sounded so nice together, and the bluesy, almost Johnny Mathis style vocals only add velvet to the air this album excreates. Tell friends about this one so that when it's reissued again for the next generation, it isn't lost like it's fellow relics; the Excalibur or Christs' Chalice.

B000002OX5|5.0|Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle, and the indomitable Keith Moon. They were the Who, a blues band with a hard rock feel and dark, ebony inducing vocals. That is, except on this album. Here, they mix lightly toasted psych with mellow driving rock to give the listener a multitude of things to look forward to on re-listens. &quot;Armenia City In The Sky&quot; is pure psych while songs like &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Rael&quot; are heartfelt and warm to the touch. Then there are &quot;Tattoo&quot; and &quot;Our Love Was&quot;, bolth introspective pieces and very well performed. Nearly all the songs on this album have a sort of &quot;cosmic awareness&quot; that goes with them. You understand what is trying to be said. Roger Daltrey, love him or hate him, had a field day with the material on this album. His singing,(dare I say it) is the bright point on most of the tracks. His own composition, &quot;Early Morning, Cold Taxi&quot; is a nice fit for the album to boot. A necessary album from 1967, if only for &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;. This was the Who's only journey into the realm of psych, and it wasn't a fruitless one.

Is the basis for back to School and the ehanced portions but that's okay. White Pony is extremely diverse CD. Ranging from calm mellow rock(Digital Bath) to the straight out Shout fest(Elite). Also the best track on White Pony is Passenger featuring none other than Maynard From Tool. Don't think that just because Maynard is featured that the song sounds anything like tool. it's not. In order to find oout how it sounds you'll have to buy it. Like every other reveiwer has stated White Pony is not just another Around he Fur. It's deeper and more melodic.
0790729369|5.0|Just want to echo the chorus of praise for this greatly underrated film.  I still cry everytime I see it-very few films have this profound effect on me.  This film says pretty much everything one can possibly say about having a soulmate and the ecstasy and agony of a bittersweet love that lives on in the spirit and heart long after the flesh is gone......sigh............just get a glass of wine, turn off the phones and be taken away.  :)
B00005B36H|1.0|Woah. Tool. Dude. This &quot;C-D&quot; is a metal band trying to be intelligent. It's an interesting combination. Kinda like Spinal Tap trying to be college professors. But it works, in a solar-powered flashlight kind of way.
0425180638|5.0|I have had the pleasure of reading all of Patricia Cornwell's books and I found The Last Precinct to be every bit as exciting, entertaining and enthralling as the others.  Her writing style keeps me keyed up, I never fall asleep while reading her work.  After reading one readers review of this book I was a little worried that I would not enjoy it, but I needen't have worried, I was pleasantly &quot;on the edge of my chair&quot; throughout the book.  I can't wait for the next one.  Bravo!!!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I'm not going to go into what the original book ending was to Hannibal, but the ending chosen for the movie was a copout. As for the movie, that would be my only complaint. Moore held her own in a role that doesn't call for much depth an insight, as this is Hopkins' show. One of the real bright spots is of course Gary Oldman as the main antagonist Mason Verger. The makeup is fantastic and his sadistic portrayal of the character is dead on perfect. All in all, better than Manhunter but a notch below SOTL. If you are going in expecting Silence of the Lambs Part Two, you will be disappointed. Hannibal is on the loose and the psychological interplay he had with Clarice in the first film won't work as well here as action does. A fun film with a very funny, but disappointing, take on the ending
0345404475|2.0|This book sucks. A fan of Blade Runner I is. A fan of this book I ain't. The plot dev is clunky. Character dev is next to non-existant. Silly twists and weak ending. I haven't read another other Dick novels but if this represents what he was up to... he was up to no good.  Yes I do like SF...<br />Pass on this.
6305426651|5.0|I saw the film without any knowledge of what the critics had said about the film.  I own it, and have watched it over many times.  I have not even read the other amazon.com reviews before doing this one.<br />If you dislike Holocaust movies per se, still see this movie. This is a story about living life and loving.  Guido is the epitome of a true man.  He is a little goofy, but endearing.  At first I put up with his antics, but as the movie progressed, Benigni (Guido) had me wishing I was his princepessa.  He loved Dora with a passion that I've rarely seen in life.  He consistently refused to live life at a low level, no matter what the circumstance.  He refused to bow to any circumstance or public opinion that made him feel less than a prince.  Principe Guido!  <br />He seemed to glide through life with his wit and optimism.  He refused to be offended by racism, and protected his loved ones by making light of racist attacks.  His humor and creativity shielded his son through the concentration camp experience, all the way to the end.  He was a winner...an overcomer.  He gave this great gift of winning to his son, whose innocence was intact to the end.  <br />You start out the movie thinking Guido's a goofball, and end up realizing that he is a man among men.  That is the charm of the movie, that you become attached to them as though you know them.<br />This movie is about a horrible event, but will make your spirit soar.  Every line and every scene of the movie is important, so pay attention.  Listen to the Italian spoken as you read the subtitles.  It is part of the beauty of the movie.  Life is beautiful, and no one can steal our outlook or optimism unless we allow them.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Lyrics aside, this solo album debut by Dido is absolutely captivating and ranks as one of my all-time favorite CDs. Im always on the lookout for a refreshing CD that has a distinctive sound, and this album is one of those CDs you can place in your stereo for months at a time and not tire of it. In fact, Ive loaned this album to 10+ people, all of who have different music tastes than myself, and each one enjoyed it so much, they ended up buying a copy of their own, even back in the heydays of Napster. <br />Im not quite sure how to classify the sound. Its just a very mellow and relaxing album without sounding the least bit new age-ish. I supposed its very Seattle-ish, if anything: the kind of music you would imagine playing in the background as you walk along quiet city streets late at night with the threat of rain hovering over your head. Her brother mixes in some great clean beats that balance with her delicate alto voice perfectly. Unfortunately, some of the lyrics are rather inane and shallow, but I rarely listen to the words in songs so it didnt bother me. <br />If you like a mellow Madonna, a minor-key Sarah MacLachlan, a slow Dave Matthews Band, or U2s Joshua Tree, check out this CD. I have yet to meet someone who regretted buying it.
B00004U2HK|5.0|This is my second favorite musical after Annie. It's brillant in every way. The music is great for all ages, a great movie for little ones but you can still enjoy it at age 50. The movie follows, Maria, a young woman who leaves the convent to become the governess of the children of Captain von Trapp. She is the one who wins over the children and their father with her warmth and her wonderful songs. Taking place during World War II though presents the family with a forced escape from the Nazis. It truly is one of the best musicals ever made. Every house hold should own a copy.
B00005A1PR|5.0|What can I say, this CD is...words can't explain how great this CD is. This is one of my most played CD. I can't get enough of this CD. I love her style, her lyrics. She is defienately keepin it real on this CD. Her song Video is awesome. I like the message.  Back to the Middle is awesome, I'm Ready For Love, BEAUTIFUL...that song I heard in the movie theather  and was instantly in love wit that song. I love that song. I understand what she's talkin about in that song. This CD is worth the money and more. She did an outstanding job and I can't wait till her next CD. You'll enjoy her guitar and her soft melow voice.
0671034065|5.0|What a great book! I had to read all night, I simply couldn't put it down. Linda Howard used exactly the right amount of suspense, erotic and humor. This was my first Linda Howard book. I am looking forward to the next one.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Some confident music journalists always claimed that Amnesiac, Radioheads Kid A follow up, was going to be an album where the band would &quot;rock out&quot; and revisit the glory days of Pablo Honey and The Bends.  But Radiohead are far from done with their &quot;experimenting&quot; and prove beyond any reasonable doubt that they are the kings of modern rock.  Amnesiac is an exceptional album.  Theres a little something for everybody.  The &quot;cool&quot; guitar riff of I might be wrong, the Kid A-ish Pyramid song, which is a brilliantly constructed song. Some brilliant electronic features on Pact like sardines..., and pulk/pull..  Fans of early Radiohead will no doubt enjoy Knives out.  Amnesica isnt perfect though.  The new version of Morning Bell doesnt serve any real purpose, and Hunting Bears is an atmospheric guitar song which isnt in the same class as other songs on the album.  But these are minor details that dont damage the outcome.  Amnesiac is yet another sensational Radiohead album, and although the boys have been generous for the last year so, already i cant wait for the next album.  There is nothing comparibly as good as this currently in the record stores.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this CD.  I have to listen to it almost on a daily basis.  Wow, I really enjoyed their previous works too.  It's not as good as their &quot;Songs of Faith, Love, and Devotion&quot; CD, but it is really good nonetheless!
