B007TMSPTU|1|had an original for years with a brown plastic top. This item uses a rubber top that is too soft to stand having tubing pushed on and off very often.  The fittings on the top are too soft to support much of a rubber or plastic bleed tube, and they tend to bend in the direction of load.If you can still find the original brown plastic type I think you will be much happier.
B0002MSY86|5|3M makes the best asnd paper. this works well wet or dry. We use it wet to finish on bare metal.
B00PHTXWQS|5|Awesome light, Super bright. Fit excellent.
B00REJX5BQ|5|Perfect fit. Slightly disappointed in the plastic pull down latches. Feel kinda cheap. Looks great and works great! Good buy for $200.
B0036QX4EY|5|barelyfits my 2009 buell 1125r but works. may bend tabs outward a touch so as to not scratch swingarm. good quality, real sturdy. cant beat it for the price, plus its collapsable!
B004ETQ2LO|5|High quality product. Still smells like plastic (duh.... cuz it is), but for emergency water, it's fine.
B0082CTSOM|1|Do not order these caps under this number. They are not right at all.for  2006 Audi A4.
B000G76OMA|5|perfect to reach a zerk behind a steering bar on my outboard. worked perfect.
B00SBZRELY|4|Works really great. Only thing the can has to be higher than the receptacle your pumping into.
B008032QBA|1|Never again. Worked great for a couple of monthe, now I have to replace it again.
B00NG87S44|5|Car sounds much nicer. Louder than I expected. Wife thinks its too loud. I love it. Had it professionally installed for $150.
B00WMK6Z46|1|I didnt purchased this sorry.. ***disclaimer***
B00N41RSMU|5|I didn't buy this on Amazon but got lucky because it was already installed in the bed when I purchased my Viking.  This fits perfectly in the rear and when it gets dirty, just take it out, shake it off, then put it back inside.  If you want a fat piece of rubber that says Yamaha, then buy this.
B0053WQVSU|3|A little small for 8 Years Kid
B000S2UGWC|5|Swapped out the parts in 10 minutes and saved myself at least an hour of labor at the stealership.
B0089SZXAC|5|Good quality. Does the job better than the broken one did.
B0040AE7WS|5|it was perfect i loved it i guess it was so cool someone stole it off my car o well it was cheap so i bought another one
B006GZLHQ4|5|My 49er fan loved getting this in his stocking!
B00RCVJB2S|1|Is not loud at all. Can't hear over over engine with full face helmet
B002UC30AS|4|I love these stickers, and will continue to buy them when I change RVs, because as a full-time RVer they stimulate conversation (and free beers) in campground.  Because they slapped the term &#34;RV&#34; on them, the charge probably 10 times as much as they should.
B004QXL4F2|5|good product
B0000AY3SR|5|Cleans yellowed headlight lens easily and they are clear again.  My Toyota Prius lens had started getting a white cloudiness on pt of it.  The clearer probably took off any original protection, but not many options when some of it starts to go.  Using Blue Magic sealer, but cloudiness comes back after couple months and need to redo everything.
B006D9W12C|5|Perfect!
B004JO61GK|4|Ramp is light weight, even for its size. Folds up for better storage and transport. The ONLY reason I am rating this a 4 star vs. a 5 star is because the rubber pads to prevent the ramp rubbing on a tail gait or trailer came off the 1st time I used the ramp. If the manufacturer could secure the pads in a better way and do more welds to secure the smaller cross members, it would be worth even more $. I am very pleased with the ramp and the price was very reasonable. The security tie downs they come with are a little cheap with stitching coming undone, but now I'm just nit picking. Highly recommend.
B00JK324Z2|5|Sturdy and very great cables at an amazing price.
B001VMYQ42|4|it fit and seems fine so far, will update if anything changes.
B00BZR3O46|5|Holy smokes those are bright! I feel bad sometimes...sitting at a light with a Prius in front of me; knowing the driver wishes he/she had not cut my truck off. I mean, sitting in the driver's seat it looks like a scene from COPS when they shine that ultra-bright light in the car and they tell the driver to poke their hands out the window. &#34;Driver! Drop the COEXIST sticker, the homemade bong, and them nasty pair of Birkenstocks! Now walk back to my truck with your hands in the air...like you just don't care.&#34; Yeah, they're that bright. These little power houses push out some really white light that cut thru the darkest night...and will whiten your teeth if you stand in front of them...probably make you sterile too. But in all seriousness, if you’re looking for that &#34;UFO&#34; look for your ride, these will do it. &#34;Can you describe the shape of the UFO Mr. Mojo? Yeah, it looked like a two door Honda Civic!&#34;
B000IHLZ5E|5|The best threadlocker
B00153ZO20|5|Extremely nice! Can't wait to see it on my truck!! Thanks again !
B000P6WMT6|1|within a month outer rubber cracked and gone, so not worth for any thing
B000WER74Q|3|For Custom they don't fit nearly as seamlessly as in the pictures, there are more cost effective alternatives.
B002Y31WY4|5|This is the OEM part for the Toyota coil, meaning that Denso makes the Toyota part and the only difference is that this part says Denso on the side and not Toyota.  Works perfectly.
B0071F64S4|5|ok
B000C93GTQ|5|Excellent
B0012S9A5U|5|Did the job.
B0034ND4JO|4|fits well but strap in a pain to use
B0064IU5FW|1|Received product....touch screen was not useful. Could not select touch screen icons to tune vehicle.
B005FKSG3I|5|Item was as described and met my needs.
B004N63S9W|4|Works really well on leather and rubber. Does not smell bad and keeps leather clean for a while
B008VQQSEC|1|I installed this unit on my 2002 2500 Cummins show truck with 2.5&#34; leaving blocks, this truck has 35&#34; tires and does not go out in the winter or bad weather. The truck only gets driven around 500 miles a year. The truck started having trouble with the dreaded DEATH WOBBLE. I had never had this happen before and it started within a 1000 miles of install Proforge track bar. Reinstall the used Moog track bar and problem solved.
B00RW4MTXS|5|Easy to install.  Has been on for approximately 4 months as of right now and no problems.
B001U522GO|4|Our soap was broken in the bucket and all over our other things that came with it.
B001MU28F2|5|Great spark plug. I have a 2004 trailblazer LS, 4.2L I6. I had the ACdelco plug in but wanted to see what the NGK would do. First, and most important thing, that I want to tell everyone. DO NOT trust a &#34;pre gap&#34; spark plug. I don't know if I have ever seen a plug that was pre gapped, correctly. All the delco were @ .035-.038 before I gapped them. At least the NGK were all @ .040. I took the gap to .044. What a great spark plug. I think, so far, I am a new NGK, fan. Side by side, the NGK wins in every test.
B001GS0D8Y|5|Perfect fit.  No modifications needed.  Very pleased with them.
B005DUN478|5|Great grips they are very comfortable and easy to install after installation I went riding for 8 hrs never had an issue grips stayed tacky even when wet
B000C9SI26|5|Best Price on Delco Filters!
B006B2V35W|5|Great buy, especially for the price. The stock exhaust does not sound good and this is a great way to get your bike sounding great without spending too much. It looks good too. And it was not terrible to install myself (I have no experience at all with that kind of stuff).
B0049IACSO|5|worked better then I thought it would. I did put anti slip tape on the ramp and carrier , had no problems getting the bike up the ramp
B001O0CHXS|5|Great Item fast shipping
B007J7E54E|5|We bought these as a gift for our daughter's Godfather because he is a HUGE Tarheels fan! We looked EVERYWHERE for these and they were so pricey! Finally found them on Amazon for a GREAT PRICE! He will be so thrilled for his birthday!
B000BM8RT8|5|Great little pump,have used it several times. I do wish the cord was longer, I have to throw the hose under the truck to get the rear passenger tire and the cord doesn't let me drop it on that side to get it to the back but so far it has functioned flawlessly
B002302CAG|5|Can still keep a football and blanket in my trunk, but I don't have clutter all over the bottom. I hooked it up to the ceiling in my trunk and, for an '06 accord sedan, it fits like a glove.  Deffo a must have for anyone that likes to have stuff but doesn't like it taking up trunk room.
B00GU5J122|5|great item
B00JPZAAL0|5|I've been eyeing one of these for a while and it is exactly what I was looking for.  My worry was that the design/metal would be cheap and flimsy but this one seems durable; durable enough to last the fifty years at least if you take care of it.  I like the design and I use it as a keyring for my keys so it is always with me.  I have no excuse for not knowing what the day is.
B00EP3IG0E|5|give a clean look love it great buy dont pass this buy up
B004U3THY8|5|Fit great and look even better
B00OGXJPBM|5|Bought for my husband and he loves it. Great for all those Paul Walker fans out there.
B001HATY36|5|It locks my coupler, what more can I ask for? Any security device will have flaws, this will serve to keep the honest people honest.
B001V8UKBY|5|Exactly what we needed in an emergency for a quick trailer tire change.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Put these on my jeeps cargo rack. All I can say is I feel sorry for whoever high beams me!
B000BUU5WW|5|Have used this twice while camping, works great!
B00DTL2ZQE|4|Bought these for my wife's '03 Ram. They greatly improved the ride of the warn-out factory shocks. Well worth the cost.
B007O5GWSS|5|Installed on my 2000 Suburban 1500 that already had the tow package and it was straight plug-n-play with the items provided. The controller has a very solid feel. I've only used it a little bit at this point, but I'm quite pleased thus far.
B001NYIHWA|5|Best Deal on filters. Period!
B000KYYIDQ|3|i was not happy and disappointed that this wasn't the right remote key for my car as it said it was. I went to mechanic to have it programmed and he couldn't so, i ended up going to the dealership and they still couldn't. After all the trouble, I found out it wasn't the right key fob afterall and that they don't have stock for the right one. I am still stuck with my key without fob and it's hard when you have kids, reason i bought it. 2 stars still for prompt refund and responding quick<br />Find more products to review at:
B002FT5N8S|5|Bought these and installed them in my Infiniti G37 Coupe, was afraid to do it myself (not a mechanic) but watched a video on you tube and good god was easy as all heck to install (5 min max)<br /><br />This filters replaced the original factory filters, great buy and well worth the money.
B003D73U6S|5|As someone who details professionally I have not found a compound as good as this stuff. It is expensive but I have used more expensive that is not as good of a product. It seems more like a polish in consistency and cuts like a compound but it finishes out like a heavy duty polish would. I still requires a fine polish to finish but I have finished out plastic, such as headlights, without needing to polish after using a polishing pad for a one step restoration. Use only with foam pads,.
B00E3BQRBI|2|It was not compatible with the existing holes.  we were not able to use.
B002RWEVMW|5|This BD Diesel Performance boost fooler part# 1515936 works for 2004.5-2007 Dodge Cummins 24 valve only! I have a 2004.5 Dodge Ram 3500 5.9 liter 24 valve Cummins and am running a smarty tuner and boost levels exceed the stock levels with a custom tune set. This boost fooler works great and does its job with no problems. It is plug and play easily and ties into your mapp sensor with no wire cutting at all.
B005OP884G|5|fits great, works great, looks good.
B00E8OA7H0|5|I put this on my Nissan Frontier, works great for hauling around kayaks and plenty of room for camping gear!!!
B00E978H3W|5|Thanks
B0009IQZH0|5|Works great for waxing, Wish I had fround it befor;
B0009JB7GI|5|This has been working for over a year, 32000 Miles. I have it hidden in my truck, works perfect.
B0043YIFGU|1|Used it twice and it got busted. I followed the instructions so I'm confident that it was not my fault. I guess one shouldn't really expect much from a $10-$11 pump.
B007Q92GT6|1|This case does not close when it is full of CDs. In the attached picture, I am pressing the case down to attempt to close it. It does not even come close to closing. The zipper also gets stuck and it took three weeks to get to our apartment.
B002UC6NFM|5|Fit the sockets great. Just what I needed.
B000CPZYC2|4|Great
B007V5C0NC|4|Very easy installation and hides well. Recommend this to anyone. Using it for a bike rack.
B010OWT6F8|1|Does not fit the drz400 at all or sm
B00NRFYKTC|5|I love the fact that he takes the time to explain. The item was super easy to apply. For installation video go to my channel on you tube. Search for BluKawiChik.
B005H6VWV8|5|My son bought these for his 2013 Chevy Silverado. They look great on his truck.  My husband and son are not do-it-yourselfers, so we paid a local garage 100.00 to install them and make sure they were level and aligned correctly.
B00NUDZKWW|4|The medium is too small for a BMW 328i. I needed a large.
B001N729FS|5|Cheap and easy.  This thing is great.  I wish they made one for motorcycle batteries.
B009DJYJZG|5|Great quality! I had to return first one because it was damaged in shipping pretty badly - make sure you check over very carefully before painting. This is def. OEM steel quality design and even has holes to match up for bed liner. ALSO you cannot beat the price unless you went to a junk yard.
B011KHEHWS|5|Really absorbent ,  and a good size. I can easily dry off my whole SUV with this towel. It does not leave lint nor does it scratch your car. I recommend this towel  to anyone looking for a good towel to dry their car. It definitely beats the old bath towels that I used to use.
B00R8LWZU2|3|It works fine. I can't imagine it works any better than some warm water and soap though or other fabric cleaning concoctions.
B004A530VW|5|Perfect fit on a 92 miata
B004Y20CLC|5|These are AWESOME!! If you take a box cutter and cut just around the top of the green part, break it off and throw it away it works great!!
B005J94L0C|5|Fits perfectly - and thin enough to roll up and store
B004HM0QBK|5|great
B007Q4TDVK|5|EXCELENT, VERY GOOD QUALITY
B00MOOPNXY|5|Bought this for my 2005 electra glide. It was only a two speaker system from the factory but still worked on my harley. I put two speakers in the saddlebags and the other two in the fairing. It took a little tuning to get it as loud a crystal clear as I wanted but I would never go with another system. This is AMAZING.
B00BAZC1SS|1|Ordered red looks more like pink. Total waste of time and money
B00NHBYOA6|5|I've been using this  cooler in a house for a week now after a two-day drive (in July).  No problems, so far. I plan to use it to travel cross country running the cooler off the car battery in the day and using a 12 volt converter at night in the hotel.  Trip last year with a rolling but unpowered cooler was a constant hassle, refreezing blue ice if I could get a room with a fridge, or dealing with ice and subsequent water, moving food from cooler to fridge and back every day, constant anxiety about keeping my food cool traveling through the southwest in the summer. This way, I'll have to lug the cooler into my room at night (who needs a gym?), but that beats moving the food to the fridge and back, trying to refreeze the blue ice or fill with ice (just LOVE cheese soaked all day in water).... no fun.  I'll update this review if the product fails over the next 4 months, but so far, after 7 days of constant use, I'm thrilled!  Note:  It doesn't work exactly like a fridge -- it just cools to 36 degrees below ambient temperature, which is OK in a car with the AC running or inside. I wouldn't expect it to keep food safe in a hot environment BUT it is very well insulated, so even without power it kept things very cool in a hot car while I was shopping.  When camping, if it's hot I can add ice or freezer packs to help it make it through the night.
B00D0IFHVQ|5|Still can't believe the quality of these assemblies compared to the cost. But I was surprised to see the box label identify they were made in China and not in the USA. Moog is a very reputable company making parts for fighter aircraft and the space program. Had my mechanic install them ($100 per side) since the car would need an alignment afterwards. He mentioned that he really liked them. Time will tell if there are any hidden issues lurking, and the length of time I keep my cars, I just might find out.<br /><br />And yes, as previously described by others, the front end sits higher than before. Some of the height difference is most likely due to the fact the original springs and struts being severely worn (100,000 miles). The mechanic said they will settle down a little the more they are used.
B001B6R00U|5|NGK spark plugs are the best plugs you can buy. Great price too. Love Amazon.
B002FCEE4Y|5|Good
B004I0QKDO|5|Fits right, works well and reasonably priced.  I am satisfied.
B00KTHXW0E|4|It is a good product
B0052WHJY6|5|Work great I use them as a ladder rack and they haven't bent from the weight or stress.
B004EB9A5M|3|After about two weeks of having it, the screw holding the leather must have come out and I lost the leather and screw while out and about. They should use loctite on the screws of these things.
B00JR0QPK8|3|Arrived Quickly, and while they fit my vehicle, the brightness difference between standard and when braking is not enough to safely keep installed. Considering blacking out one or two of the stage 1 elements or (if I can) re engineering them to fire on the braking stage. Otherwise not a bad product. ** Too Designer - the top disc elements (3) would be sufficient to satisfy the driving light stage (stage one) and all remaining elements should fire on the braking stage (stage 2)
B005GYDBNS|5|ok
B00P6OOEBQ|5|fits perfect on my 2004 base Acura RSX.
B00065L2D8|5|Works as advertised.....add on item.
B00CDJ8RLU|3|I'm torn on this product.<br />I purchased the kit specifically for the T5 Torx bit so that I could get into my ASUS Ultrabook.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The design of the kit is GREAT.<br />I received everything in perfect condition and the variety of bits is exactly what I had hoped for.<br />I love the organization, ease of access to the pieces and compact size. (See photo)<br />I grabbed the kit version which has the flexible extender. It is very useful for getting into tight areas where the length of the driver is too much.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The durability of the bits.<br /><br />I avoided other products with reports of this exact issue.<br />The bit twisted! (See photo)<br />I was able to get the screws into the laptop enough to hold it together, but because I cannot tighten them down I am now having touch pad issues.<br />Ultimately I am disappoint and wish this kit came with higher quality bits.<br /><br />I'm still in search of a T5 Torx bit which will last. I might give Wiha a try.
B004A30MGA|1|i used this stuff on my rv and was very disappointed in it, only lasted a year and it curled up and peeled off like sunburn...would not buy this stuff again nor would i recommend it either.  waste of money
B001OK6Q2Q|5|gasket fit perfectly. got the carb rebuilt and installed cheaply
B005FN2I1Q|4|Fit and stay on pretty well.  It's hard to fasten them on cars that have a lot of mechanisms under the front seat.
B01014VEE0|5|bought for extra sleeping when my grandson came for a week! perfect!
B0092JSQ5Q|5|Very cute and good quality material used for these stickers! They are a nice, thick vinyl that holds up to all climates. Washing them when I wash my jeep is not a problem, it does not damage them. I would definetly purchase more.
B000C9GC8I|5|Perfect fit
B00U5HUTXG|1|Pieces didnt fit some too small some apots too big and the big parts ripped so now it looks not good two vent pieces werent big enough overall i wastes 40.00 i would have jus left what i put on before when i sized it with 5 dollars of vinyl
B00DGWT9AG|1|Bogus,...starter does NOT fit 2005 400ex don't know what it does fit evidently they don't either. Doesn't even look like this pic...would NOT buy anything from these people.
B006PGFVWU|5|love it!  Great quality, great price!  Great and fast service
B00AF4UABA|5|just ordered..Great reviews..will mount 12000 lb badland winch... will update.....wife made me happy....Up date (August 11) just received brush guard and it does look Great . Very well built. Way better than what i expected. I was lucky to have bought last one. will highly recommend. And i will be doing more bussiness with them in the future. Thanks..
B004C443R6|5|Very nice, soft gloves. My husband loves them.
B00KLGP4CC|5|Works great don't forget your plug and  harness  Sold separately
B004I0LC32|5|perfect fit for my 2001 Nissan Maxima! It was literally plug and play. Really easy install.
B004SSAF5A|1|I stored this for a few months before using it since by previous cover (a different brand) held on longer than expected. This cover has been on a few months and is already turning to dust and tearing oi the Arizona Sun. Definitely will not buy again.
B000CBXSX8|5|Easy to install and works great.
B009EU5ZMA|5|JBWeld easy to use
B004J5KY5S|2|I put this on my '06 Yamati 150 and it starts but won't throttle up, idles rough too. No way to adjust the preset jets and i'm not jetting it. Might work on a 50cc but not enough fuel for a 150 that's for sure.
B002JM4N2I|4|I love it but kinda disappointed with the size
B004VG6KI0|5|love it this is my second rolls you can use it on many things not just car
B003E1O9ZE|5|Great item; couldn't beat the price.
B0009IBJE4|2|Frustrated... I've used this charger 5 times  to charge a brand new 12v AGM battery.  Now when I try to charge the display jumps from my keyed in settings to 'standard battery' at the lowest settings... I registered my charger and called the help line... Followed their instructions after waiting 30+ minutes on hold, and still no luck.  I paid a LOT more for this charger than th Amazon price at a Batteries Plus store.  Wishing I hadn't been in such a hurry now.
B001DUD1KW|4|Arrived on time, near perfect replacement part. needed some minor repositioning of the mounting clamps to match existing hole placement.
B00IUUHH26|5|Popped right in and looks much better over the chrome aftermath of the original badge. Definitely OE/OEM.
B001G7U45W|5|Well Seald package ///<br />Exact item \\\ would purchase again ///
B00BINXJJ2|5|Pro level stuff delivered promptly!
B007HA7RF2|5|great
B003RVT35W|5|Delivered quickly, easy to program and a great value!
B0049MTHOU|5|looks and works good
B003UT3S6Q|5|Throw some of these on your wheels before spraying it to wash, and it will wipe away grime. Surprisingly, this also cleans up rust / break dust that piles up on and around your calipers. Saved me the effort of taking my wheels off to clean those! Wonderful product.
B009SCSXVO|2|The post is too large.  the only ring terminal that will fit are the extra large yellow ring terminals.  I cannot find blue or red terminals that would fit.  Most vehicle wires are in the 12-16 AWG range...  I would have made this terminal post at least one size smaller.  I Cannot use these.  I would like to return them!
B0031I5Z6C|5|Same AC Delco parts the dealer will happily clean your wallet out for. Have had them on my car before and they lasted a long time without any issues, as long as you maintain your calipers and pads properly.
B004XXFYA6|5|my love them
B000CINV88|5|Didn't need this because I purchased ThermoQuiet brakes from Wagner. But it came fast with my original order and was exactly as described.
B000C7QH94|4|I got a cosmetic defect one for $75 including shipping.  A few fins were bent.  Was a royal pain in the ass to install...But, this was mostly Jeeps fault not Spectra.  I did have to drill out wider a hole in the plastic shroud to mount/bolt the radiator shroud.  I consider Spectra to be good quality.
B010LEVC1A|1|The Bag is fine, but it does not fit the jack head. In order to return it they want to charge me $6.24 for a item I paid $9.02. I will not buy from people that will not stand behind there product.
B004ZF44NA|4|I love the lights not really complaining but i ordered 12ks and im pretty sure i got 6k or 10k they are still very bright and blue but they are like white with blue tint
B010PD9NRM|5|I bought 4 of these and they work great.  One review said they didn't work and they probably didn't if he didn't use the correct polarity.  Diodes only work with current flowing one direction.  Only problem is that I can't order more.  The web site says out of stock and don't know when there will be more.  These are great lights, whats the hold up?
B003876SIK|5|I got these for my 2001 Golf.  Make sure you measure your sway bar before you order, as some are 21mm and some are 23.mm.  It is a little tricky to get the sway bar bushing to tighten up.  I recommend you find a bolt that is the same thread size and pull it in and snug it down before putting the original bolt back in, or take some needle nose vice grips and use them to hold the clamp closed so you can get the bolt in.  As far as the stabilizer link bushings, I just used a knife to shear off one side and drove the old ones out.  On the new ones, they are marked upper and lower, so make sure you pay attention.  I took the edge of one side to the belt sander and put a light 45 degree bevel on, then pushed them in with a vice.  It took several times of getting them straight, but once they are started, you can push them in and then take them out of the vice and use a rubber mallet to make them seat the rest of the way.
B004QJN98Q|4|Had some serious oxidation on a window from well water sprinklers. I thought I was going to have to replace the glass as I was unsuccessful in removing the stains. Saw a show on the science channel that talked about Cerium Oxide and I decided to give this a try. Used a orbital polisher with a mild polish pad. Took about an hour and repeated applications but the glass looks like new now. Patience is your friend. So are power tools don't do it by hand!
B00H43A4GQ|5|Perfect fit.
B004GCFRUG|5|Fit perfect and at a great price!
B000E28C8G|5|Its an oil filter and its K&N.  Whats not to like.
B0049CNWN2|5|Works great and held up well on my cross country trip.
B00D9C2CDO|5|In the middle of a 7 day road trip through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and it's working great so far. We did use a ratcheting strap from our kayak mount in the middle for some extra protection.<br /><br />Holds more gear than I thought it would. Unfortunate  since it seems we brought half the house with us.
B00427MIFC|5|good
B002N1J5IM|5|Well made product, Easy to install just follow there directions . Quick shipping
B003V3RVWI|5|I was a bit skeptical but have to say that this product really works great. I use it on my Jeep Wrangler after trips to the beach, camping etc. Does not leave streaks and is easy to apply. Have used it about a half dozen times on my 4door JK and it's about 1/4 of the way done which is better than I expected. I'm going to buy a refill soon. Super product, very pleased with it.
B0055PD1H4|5|Works great!!
B005VU3PC4|3|Not bad re-fitting.  A bunked up the old ones traversing a log in a downed tree scenario, but the originals were factory. These after markets do NOT stick out as far so pivoting your footing on the landing pad is not comfortable, and makes it a bit awkward getting in and out of the vehicle. It'll probably be worse when the next snow storm hits and there's ice on it as well.  never had to worry about that on old rails.
B00FC22BSU|5|worked great installed in a 96 ram VERY bright but only have hi beams.. also 10000k is a light blue in color.
B001QEBTIG|1|These are fakes and bad fakes at that. I've owned at least 6 of these since I ride with them and manage to leave them on my shirt for the wind to steal. I tried this seller on a whim and just wow... I'm attaching a picture. When I say a bad fake I mean they didn't even pretend to be River Road but instead have their actual brand name on the tag which is &#34;GLOBAL VISION&#34;.
B001Q22586|3|Worked well took longer than expected to arrive
B000P6UNL0|4|Seats tight and does not leak under pressure. Like other reviewers said, it can be difficult to unseat. I found that pushing it towards the fitting then pulling off at an angle with slight twist seems to work best. Be careful on recessed fittings with no wiggle room because you may have to carefully pry it off with a screw driver or pliers.
B002UD0GFE|5|Works as designed.
B000FQBWCY|5|Nice charger
B00L9NI66C|1|Have a tendency to fog up after vehicle is exposed to rain or overnight condensation from evening dew.
B00REJXHIM|5|Fits 2015 Tacoma SB nicely.  The tailgate and front of the bed are not as sealed as the sides.  The cover comes with weatherstrip, presumably for the front of the bed since that is the largest gap (can see light with it installed).  Have not install the weatherstrip yet, not keeping anything that must be kept perfectly dry in the bed.  The cover is very heavy, fits tightly, and looks good.  Installing a tailgate lock since the cover is only secured with 4 clamps which are easily removable without tools.
B0012RGA2W|5|Works great and easy to use.
B004X1T9L8|4|Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥~♥♥~♥♥~♥
B000G78P8G|2|Pan is great, but had dents in several places.  Still going to use it though as it serves it purpose
B00CP6JRJM|5|Good
B0050EEOK8|5|My wife has a bad back and a bad knee, I bought this as an intermediated step between the ground and the first step of our 5th Wheel camper.  It is very study, light, compact, very stable, replaces the wooden step I had built for this purpose.  Much easier to use.  I would recommend this product.
B00230HTKE|4|Worked for my application
B00BCRMBGQ|5|Great quality universal car seat cover set. The seat covers are thin but offer great protection. I washed and air dried the seats before installing them. They hold up nicely after washing. They do require a little work to install, but it was well worth it.  I have a toddler who is VERY messy and I feel at ease knowing these covers are protecting my seats in case he has a spill or big mess.  I received this product at a discounted rate to offer an unbiased review.
B008G32EO8|5|fits 2002 hyundai elantra, nice and sturdy, well packaged will probably buy parts for my car from this seller again
B00IYNRT9A|4|Nice product by itself. Installation is not as hard as I thouht on my Honda Civic 2014 but it still took me almost a full 1.5 hours... so assume it will take you a good 2 hours from start to finish. It installed nice but I am unable to put back my underbody plastic covering with the hitch installed. From the instruction, it sounded like I could if I cut a portion of the plastic covering but it is not the case in reality. There is not enough clearance where the original screw holes are after installing the hitch so buyer beware of this.  Without the underbody plastic covering, I expect there will be lots of water and road dirt spatters accumulating in nooks and crannies overtime, and probably the backside of the car and bumper area underneath will be more prone to get rust and etc.
B004GCLEPI|4|The mirror is identical to the original with the exception of a few minor things. I gave it 4 stars due to vibration once the vehicle is moving.
B00CD7EMKW|5|Works like a charm!<br />2001 Grand Cherokee
B003HBWM96|1|The glue was on the wrong side of the vent so once you put your windows up the glue would have stuck to the windows and once you rolled them back down it pulled the ventvisor off so becareful
B00COYNTJ4|1|I only bought it for the picture. It has no smell in my small car!!
B001EOYIRW|5|2007  Acura MDX best price and fits just like OEM
B00A2F329O|4|Good!
B00DILTFP4|5|[[VIDEOID:e1eddaa6d568cbe0114225e85af2feac]] This is a review of the Bosch SteelTech 20\\" wiper blade.<br /><br />The most difficult part of installing a wiper blade is usually getting it out of the packaging. This is easy to install and Bosch includes two additional plastic receiver ends to accommodate different styles of wiper arms. Most people won't have to replace the default receiver end on the blade.<br /><br />I installed this 20\\" blade on the passenger side of my 2003 Honda CRV. Usually the drivers side wiper blade is not going to be the same length as the passenger side blade. Just make sure you are getting the appropriate length for your vehicle.<br /><br />This is a great blade. The rubber edge doesn't streak and lasts  me longer than most synthetic blades that I've used. The blade resists lifting off the windshield at highway speeds too.<br /><br />You may not want this style blade for winter use though. Metal frames are more apt to allow ice and snow buildup which will affect its performance.
B00ODGR2L2|5|Will work perfect for the forks on my skid steer for moving trailers around the property.  Thanks for shipping to Alaska!
B004UPZXQM|5|Easy to apply in or out of direct sunlight.  Provide a nice gloss-like shine.  Only regret that I have is I should have bought the gallon size the first go-around.
B004X2B9II|4|I pre fit these to my window (not peeling the adhesive). At first the auto up feature hit the safety switch and rolled back down. I opened the door and put my hands on both sides sides of the window and lifted as it was rolling up. I felt where the window got tight but it stayed up. I let it sit over night to form and fit. I tested the window again before peeling the tape and everything went smoothly. Installation took about 20 minutes for all 4 windows, aside from the over night waiting. Good product so far.
B00EM8944O|4|I wish there was more in the package.  Enough for about 5 to 8 scratches depending on size.  But it works.  Needs to have a larger sanding pad
B006ZGKZ9E|5|Fit as I hoped
B00N4M95XO|5|Bright, clean light.  You can turn the flat panel to sort of aim the light, which was very useful to me so I could get more light in a certain area.  I'd recommend these.
B004S7HM52|5|Purchased these for my 2011 STI. Outstanding quality and looks fantastic on the car. Little bit of a project to get these on, unfortunately I had to remove the back tires to actually complete the installation. Worked out fine because I had to change brakes anyway. The little paper instruction manual included was junk, YouTube was a much better assistant in getting these installed. Not difficult to install, just tedious....like all car work.
B000CLDFJU|5|reviews on these pads from any forum online will tell you they perform and will outlast the others. Never had an issue with fitment and very happy with their braking performance.
B007Q1CDVK|5|Perfect fit and fixed my PO0100 check engine light. Great price.
B00ZVJ3FUM|5|Very nice for the price the front goes on smooth Back takes more work but looks high quality in a Suzuki sx4<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in return for a review
B00RJ3PNC6|1|The one I received does not work, so I will not get to see how my van might smell if it did. I've used them in my home before, so I know what the smell is like. We tried it for three days, the light showed it was on, but nothing.
B0002JN1BY|5|Great price, worked well.  Was able to save a machining project.
B007J8ILES|5|Very nice
B001R93K0K|5|I bought this sticker for my laptop and it arrived today.  Although the application instructions were blurry and barely readable, I ended up applying it very easily.  See all you have to do is remove the bottom sheet first, so that you're left with your letters and a clear sheet on top.  Then you place it where you want it and gently rip the clear sheet off. (You don't have to deal with the individual letters separately.)  Overall, I was skeptical to buy a bumper sticker to put on my laptop but it looks really nice and I don't plan on removing it anytime soon.
B0007RVLRM|5|My husband is a professional detailer and I am always up for ordering him new products he hasn't tried yet and this was by far one of the best finds yet! Great price! And stays on tires! Doesn't &#34;sling&#34; off onto vehicle when driven!
B000CB1WYU|4|Looks like a nice build quality cap better then my Hecho en Mexico that it replaces that i bought on Amazon also it performed find just kinda cheap looking !
B00JYBY8G8|1|Not real happy , don't like the sound tried contacting them for some help and never got it.
B0001L0DFA|5|love it
B00K72C1T4|5|Great product performed as advertised. Used on 6 volt auto.
B001PJS4LW|5|AS ADVERTISED AND FAST SHIPPING
B0024GR0S8|1|This looked like an excellent deal. It was dead within 6 months. never even got a jump out of it! Disappointing.
B008B03OH2|3|The zebra part was most likely a sticker that was stuck onto the valve cover. All but 1 fell off within the first week. But they are still cute being pink.
B0002MG9T2|5|Fits all sizes.  Great product.
B00L2PSFWC|5|good product
B00HZWH91Y|4|Good product, good seller, no more comments.
B00651CLCS|1|Absolute garbage don't waste your money, after installing the antenna I lost/ (static)almost all of my preset local channels.<br /><br />The factory jk antenna works 50 times better
B002UCYS0Y|4|these work great, but are kinda small
B0000CBIK5|2|While product was cheap, that is a risk I know, quality was.... fitting of the price.
B00VWX4BKO|1|The model was listed in the offer but they did not fit in my car that I got that use H8 lamps model
B001B6Z7K0|5|Screwed into the rear backing plate and stopped the leakage from the faulty one orginally in compressor.
B0097ABRR4|4|Lights are as bright as the stock h-3 but put out a better color light, only problem is I had to use a dremel to make them fit in the hole.
B00BN45CZA|1|Gunk...it broke after one day
B000CQHUYG|5|really convenient for setting up an exhaust system
B0097X6730|2|I expected this to be comfortable...I mean it's gel memory foam, right?  Well it is a hard bed with less &#34;give&#34; than you might expect.  After sleeping on it for maybe 8 nights, we have decided that we absolutely must get some kind of topper.  Other than waking up with aching bones, it's a great bed.
B00IOEKW2K|5|the product is as described, I just put on a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant and works perfect, it's not the original Japanese, hope it works well for a long time .....
B0002SRL20|5|Great
B00CPYFOW8|5|works
B008BSM0J2|5|Very satisfied
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent idea to get full window shielding. Easy to use
B001KR1BQE|5|Works great everytime I get them from Amazon for my Ford pickup.
B00G258I0G|5|Solid,lightweight, we are very pleased with the product<br />Luc
B0073XREAG|5|easy to build look great
B000VKN4R0|1|Fit of this product is great. BUT.... within 1 month of having it on the sensors are shot. I plug the old one in and the warnings all go away. Be cautious when thinking you`re going to save money on this part!
B00GV85NS4|5|Worked great
B00IXW15N8|5|Great product
B000FPZUPU|5|Bought for my 1998 TJ Wrangler.  Perfect fit
B00SIBWFWO|1|Awful steering wheel cover. Tight fit but very poor quality material. Fell apart after 1 month of use with material coming off in my hands as I was driving. Would not recommend.
B000A0YFEM|5|very pleased with product , exactly as described ,and fast delivery,  thank yoy
B001V8U12M|5|Every RV'er should have one of these attachments for their battery operated drills.  Makes maneuvering the levelers so much faster and easier.
B00SGACJF0|5|Got them fast and the box was well insulated. Installed them in 20 minutes or less. They look great. Had to use the old light twist ins because the new ones wouldn't fit the old plugs for some reason. just took the new lights that come with these and put them in the old plug in, fit perfect. Its rained many times since and no moisture got inside. 5 stars
B00I61FRZI|5|Love this!
B00710481Y|4|Ordered 2 for my Xingyue 260t-4. Came quickly but one bulb was of inferior quality. Contacted seller and he instantly replaced it. Great service, as for the bulbs they are much brighter than stock and only time will tell on their durability. I will update accordingly.
B002UC19OW|2|not effective for black streaks. thetford is the best.
B000SXCLIS|4|Excellent cover. Would have rated it a 5 star if it had a little better lock with it though.
B00B9DECRY|4|works ok even on black streaks.
B006DYFEV2|5|Fit perfect when installed. I don't know the longevity of the hose but so far so good.
B00K56PPAY|5|Great, fits perfectly in my BMW 528ix
B00OBGQUVM|1|Very unusable product. Film is made of similar material to cell phone screen protectors rather than 3m clearbra material. Did not fit well on a Subaru WRX
B000C9SJUC|5|Worked perfectly for 2000 Buick LeSabre.
B00RNE9IZO|3|This version of the LuxWurx light is obsolete and the seller even told me so before shipping, to make sure it's what I wanted. I said yes, so I can't blame anyone else. A baggie of brackets, fasteners and tools are included with each light.<br /><br />The good: lots of interchangeable parts with the other LuxWurx lights, it does produce light, and it's always worked immediately when I turn it on.<br />The bad:  moisture inside the lens of both of this model (non-3D spot) within two weeks of installing.  They still operate, so I'll remove the lenses (all tools included with the lights!) and re-seal them with silicon once their dried out.<br /><br />Overall:  They work fine but nothing to write home about. I'm confident the moisture issue will be a thing of the past once I put a thin coat of silicone on the lenses. I'd opt for the newer 3D optics version instead, though.
B000C9RRA0|5|Work very well, and only i have to buy only one in the driver side.
B000C34L8M|5|GREAT made my AC work
B00L9J9S4K|5|Great, affordable and easy to use. Application process was straight forward and light heat from a hair dryer made it stretchable to apply around curves.
B0051SERD2|1|it stinks piece of trash
B002LWFS1G|5|Exactly as described. Fit my Civic Si perfectly.
B000KL7444|5|Love it works great.
B009VHPAHQ|3|I used this product on my marble floor, (after cleaning/polishing), I've noticed that it is sticky in some places causing the dirt to stick on the floor.
B000BVRZ74|1|The ad I saw demonstrating the product was nothing like the actual directions on the product.  One reason I brought it was because it appeared easy to apply & it was not.
B00NB8UJN6|3|The install was simple on my 03 Dodge Ram 1500, but once I had them installed I realized that the dome and map lights stayed dimly lit even when the truck was off.  Thinking this would be an easy fix I went to my local auto parts store and picked up some resistors, unfortunately the resistors got to hot and nearly burned a hole in my overhead light housing. As a last resort I wired an encased light bulb inside the housing. This seems to have done the trick and appears to be safer than the resistor.
B000CSGTQE|4|Good price, delivery.
B00C4Z25AC|5|Part of a Cuban theme party.  The cars were apart of the table center piece.  Had a holder and chocolate cigar wafers in the center of the car.  Easy to assemble and many comments of the  'how cool' the cars looked.
B00GXNI06E|5|Red wing sticker works and lookrs great on my car! Nice and thick! Would buy again.
B007TG7ILC|2|Disappointed with this purchase for my 2010 GMC Sierra.  These are supposed to be OEM replacement wipers, but they smear and streak worse than the $2.99 wipers I get from a local hardware store.  Won't be buying the &#34;Bosch quality&#34; again.
B00STXAXJ8|5|Solid, quality product. Well made and fit perfectly in my 2014 Grand Cherokee. Great option at a great price.
B00BTSFN54|2|I've not even had this product for a month and the battery is completed dead. Took a meter to it and sure enough got nothing coming off of it. Should the battery have not died on me the review would have been 5 stars as aside from that the product's performance was stellar.
B00LLU7ALA|5|Works great!!
B0017ORYMU|5|came quickly and fit great
B0021UOMC4|5|good deal
B002FY7Z6Q|5|Fits perfect n fast shipping !
B00MJ480B6|5|The finish was great except for a small blemish.  Overall the product was nice.  Mounting hardware left some things to be desired. It wasn't clear as to which bracket should be placed in what position.  Looks great on my truck.
B00ZVJ2WEM|5|Love these. Fit perfectly.
B00JNEZI7O|5|Bought this for my son's electric power scooter (handicap) to put over a scratch on the front.  He loves it and it has held up very well.  Easy to install.
B005XH68M4|5|A great buy. The helmet was delivered when it was said it would be. It is light and comfy. I ware it all the time while I'm out. I had one problem with it. The clip that holds the face shield on broke off. I emailed the seller, they responded with in an hour and shipped out a replacement piece. A great buy especially for the price.
B00RTXGXRU|5|I have a Prius and now I can tell my friends that my car has a turbo! Sounds great and spins up real nice. The light is a nice little bonus.
B000HI2I5U|5|try flare and swage working so easy without force on your hand
B003UH0096|3|lasted only 4months then the starter broke it will cost me to send back so i'm going to have a new starter sent after i hear from them as of now not a word from.got starter sent back as of 8/17/15. waiting on them to get back to me to see will replaced it or if i will buy another one, i really need to get the lawn mower up and running again.hope they make it right by me . i need it Asap
B00P7F2ULK|5|Excelent Helmet & excelent price!!! Recomend it x1000000!!! Very lightweight!!!
B00RLAGAQ0|1|These mirrors are extremely tiny!  They are not suitable for a motorcycle, the entire mirror is only 3.75&#34; x 2.5&#34;, quality seems to be fine but the size is extemely small.
B004130CVE|5|Perfect fit!
B0054RIF2O|1|So frustrating. Review says that the armrest matches the Yaris interior. It even shows in the picture that it is gray. Well the one that arrived in the mail is black. Also I cannot get the stupid thing to install. The directions are so confusing. Is there a YouTube video somewhere I can watch on how to install it? Can I take it to the dealership and have them do it for me?
B003S5A0I6|5|Looked high and low for right part locally, but no one had this EXACT fit for my hummer.  After spending 3 days taking 2 diff parts back to autozone and o'reilly I finally got these from amazon and got my truck put back together and voila.  AC works on both sides again! dual zone is great until it doesn't work!
B00CXYVKKA|4|exactly as i thought i purchased, right size and excellent quality.
B000WCZJ5C|5|Not yet able to comment on the sound of this muffler yet as I have yet to install it. However watch a few videos and you will see and hear this is the real deal. A proper JDM cannon muffler. The welds are VERY good they're stacked superbly and the quality is excellent throughout the muffler. It's pretty heavy and the steel is thick. It's worth every penny in terms of build quality. This will be going into my Subaru Legacy B4 RSK sedan connected up to a full 3 inch system. If you want an authentic JDM style cannon this one is an excellent choice. The is the size of cannon you see on the big HP Supras and Skylines.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and packing was on point as well, I must say.
B004LX3AXQ|5|Speaking from experience only, I've bought several different kinds of these TYPES of battery chargers over the years.  Virtually NONE have measured up to this  brand.  I now own three of these (and will be buying a fourth for my collector cars and tractor)....one G750 and two G1100, they've walked the walk and have now earned my full trust and respect.  Several years ago, I temporarily lost my insanity and bought a couple of battery maintainers for $5 each, (!) and yup, you're right....you get just what you pay for and exactly what you deserve!  They left me high and dry with less than one year old batteries in storage....dead!  The other brands I owned would continually give me fake readouts, i.e., when they said the battery was &#34;fully charged,&#34;  in fact, after proper testing, they were only 25% charged!  And so, just &#34;maybe&#34; you might get &#34;lucky&#34; with something cheaper, made in China, Taiwan, Mexico....., but, if you absolutely want to be safe, then this is the brand that will WORK and you can trust.
B00JBQ55ZE|5|Looks Great
B001DBBTO6|4|It's a very think material that i feel will make you very hot in the summer. Item was as described and prompt delivery. Thanks
B001VMLF82|5|Best if you can find it......
B00OVBI4FM|4|as advertised
B0010GI2KS|5|Perfect
B00RCEIR98|4|They were just as I expected. They fitted my jaguar rims perfectly.
B00500F1O0|1|Sticker won't separate from backing. In order to use this I would have to take each piece off individually and place them where I want them. That is not feasable as far as I am concerned.
B0002UEN1U|5|Used on  my transmission pan, no leaks in over 32,000 miles.
B00XFS3OU2|5|Gud Rib
B000EFGWFI|4|Works great for small items....
B004BWU8H8|5|This product was AWESOME.  It arrived and within 20min of light work I had it installed.  Super-sturdy and just exactly what I needed.  Great for concealed carry, or other valuables such as wallets and other things.  Good quality stuff.
B0074OHCOC|4|I like it.
B005K8E9FY|4|This Quick Valve Change Tool did the job easier than I thought it would. I replaced a leaking valve on a Jeep YJ with 33 tires and aluminium wheels in about a minute. Jeeps/light trucks typically use .453 valve stems and this tool is designed specifically for that size. It's helpful to rotate your tire so that the valve stem is at the bottom. This way you can use your body weight to assist getting the valve removal tool pushed &#34;between&#34; the rim and the valve. A bit of dish soap on the end of the removal tool helps.Once the tool is inserted give a quarter turn to hook the back side of the valve and pull it out. You will know if you have hooked the rim and will need to make small adjustments to clear the rim/wheel and extract the old valve.<br /><br />Inserting the new valve may take a couple of tries, its real easy. The trick is steady and controlled pressure. You don't need to hammer the valve into place. With the new valve lubed with some dish soap or equivalent, hold the plastic guide tube so that when you insert the new valve its aligned perfectly with the valve hole in the wheel, apply steady, and firm pressure on the insertion tool until you feel the valve is completely thorough. Pull back until you feel the valve seated into the wheel/rim.<br /><br />This may not be a tool you will use often, but when you do need it, it will certainly save you the hassle and cost of a tire shop to do the work for you. For those that drive off road trails, this quick valve change tool should be part of your tire repair kit.<br /><br />Four stars for simplifying a tire repair that would normally require a tire shop to remove the wheel from the tire.<br /><br />A simple pouch to store these tools together would give this review 5 stars. The plastic bag these come in is to small for the valve removal tool and rips down the side. The tool itself will save you time, money and a big hassle.
B009G4Y9RG|5|Very good product & service! I highly recommend
B001GBQ47A|3|On 2008 ram -Some brighter than factory  , about  the same as  sylvania  zxe bulbs ,  was looking for something to burn little whiter ,still looking , leaning towards possible hid kit
B00GUSRYNM|4|The LEDs are a nice touch and are significantly brighter than the stock lights. In my 2012 Accord coupe EX i had 3 left over bulbs which makes no sense to me (I got the largest package). The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the trunk led is not very bright but the rest look amazing.
B004J3AGEO|3|gave to my brother they would not fit on my toco he put them on and they work great on his 07 ranger
B002M2INBC|2|Did not even install them yet due to 3 of the 4 I ordered having signs of being previously used with some rust spots and more.
B00H0E6TTU|3|Being generous at 3stars because the light bar is bright BUT AFTER ONLY HAVING IT FOR A FEW DAYS AND ONE LIGHT RAIN MOISTURE GOT BEHIND THE GLASS AND IT MAKES A VERY HIGH PITCH WHISTLE GOING DOWN THE ROAD!! IF IT WAS NOT FOR THAT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A 5-STAR RATING!
B00A7D0HKI|5|Great Batteries. I bought a pair to replace the dead batteries on my electric scooter. Works perfect. Bought a 2nd pair for my other dead scooter.
B00H6ETIUQ|5|great and easy install fast shipping
B0012BL8LG|5|Exactly what I needed so I can use my travel fridge/warmer in hotel rooms if they don't have a fridge.
B008ENFT6K|2|The emblem flew off the hood
B002L1IPBM|5|Item was as described and met my needs.
B00FB3L0A0|5|Work great
B00YB5GAEA|4|Product works well.  The only issue I have with it is that it seems a bit cheaply made.  When I plugged the charging cord into the light the piece that has the plug pushed into the body of the light.  It still works, but this seems like it shouldn't happen.  On the other hand, it it light.  Maybe the light weight is worth lighter construction.
B000CB59RG|4|Looks good should perform just fine !
B001MP2V9K|5|Matched up perfectly. Easy to install. I would use this vendor again.
B00HZBN8YM|5|Came perfect with no bends or anything. I am getting a car this month and hope to put it on there so I don't know how well it sticks. I recommend!
B00CP6IA3Q|5|Quickly and easy install.
B0027K41QU|5|Works great, I would recommend. :)
B003S9BNUG|1|I got a different keychain with jaguar logo. Not recommended.
B000C2SBSE|5|This hose fit and work as  a OEM hose.
B00PANW6K4|5|These fit perfect, the are soft, readjusting them & your seatbelt is part of loving your car. The stitched crest was above my expectations.
B0057VQWQS|5|This carrier delivered all that the manufacture promised and then some!
B00HL7UBFE|5|Excellent, so good that a past employee stole my first one.
B00A1XDD7I|5|It's a genuine Toyota filter that fits its intended application.
B004JQ7LOY|5|The old motor mount on my 2006 R52 Mini had leaked fluid all over the frame.  So this mount was a perfect fit to replace the stock part. Installation was very easy, and now I'm set for many more motoring miles with my Mini!
B000EQR1KC|1|It's is not the same as the one in the picture. And it will NOT fit an Acura RSX type s. It ends up hitting the axle and will not allow the axle to go through the spindle.
B000BR51QK|3|It was the wrong product for what I needed. The part numbers were off by one letter
B00L4FP2Q2|4|Ok- I am officially impressed!! I own a 2003 Chevy Avalanche that has the body cladding. Unfortunately, these are notorious for fading and looking very worn. I figured what better place to start than there..... WOW!!!! The cladding shinned right up and looks brand new!! I plan to give it a few days with the dusty driveway and hopefully a little rain and see how well it holds up. If it does well I'll buy 10 more bottles!! I've tried other products that even with elbow grease didn't work this well. I simply sprayed and wiped with this. No strong smell and no mess. Awesome product!! A++<br /><br />*I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.... I DEFINITELY recommend.
B001XCBCQK|3|Got the Job done. Feet attachment was difficult. hard time staying attached. Once installed served the purpose
B00FW1JXGO|5|True white and gives the truck a great appearance. They gave me 2 extras which I didn't use, not sure why
B00M8N36QC|4|exactly as i thought i purchased, right size and excellent quality.
B010RIDGVE|5|VOTE TRUMP
B000FW2MCM|5|Great producted from a trusted company and now a trusted seller!
B0088ARHDM|5|THESE TIPS ARE THE CATS A#@, ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES IVE MADE, THANKS
B00II5YEFQ|4|Does an excellent job of getting the majority of the water off my suv. I ended up buying a cheap squeegee and taking the handle off that one to put on this one. Fit perfectly. 4 stars if it came with its own handle.
B010LTYNA2|3|the batterys are great ! The charger didn't work
B00Q7HV6NA|5|awesome Amazon seller!A++++++++
B000CIM5QW|5|First time buying ACT flywheel and for sure will Buy this brand again Act Flywheels the best around. Act flywheel 12lb pound was purchased for my 00 Honda Civic si with a Jackson supercharger and it delivers  great everytime I pop that clutch in and let go.  Winning races because of the new AcT flywheel  Goes perfect for my Exedy Clutch
B00OQ1F7PM|5|Excellent product and great value!
B00BN448P0|5|Very nice key chain.  Easy to operate.  Love the satin-chrome color.  Ordered an extra one.
B008OVVYRA|4|Very handy car interior duster.
B00M79MFSW|4|People behind me seem to get a kick out of it which is a good thing:  my little car is excellent on gas mileage but struggles to speed up quickly.
B0081SQY1W|5|I needed to replace the Handicap Hangtag for my dad since we all use it when we transport him, but it would have required going to DMV which it too much of a hassle. I found these on Amazon, and they are excellent. Much heavier and nicer than ones I had before. They came in a 2 pack, which was great, since I was then able to give one to his lady friend.
B00EZBSBHY|5|Perfect fit. Made in Japan, looks like factory lighting. Oem.
B00PYDNCNU|1|Not 100 stickers like it says
B00HXC89VU|5|Cranks my 10.6:1 103 easily.
B003VB3YTE|5|Awesome
B00VT3T9Q8|5|Great production... Super fast delivery
B00GU0OIBG|5|Great product. easy to install and very durable. It actually makes my are rest more comfortable!
B00CBTRMZ4|5|WAY BIGGER THAN EXPECTED. Make sure you have ample clearance, otherwise, the unit is fantastic. Running it in my center console fishing boat with 2 batteries hooked up to a 2 battery switch. Leads from the charger hook to each battery terminal no problem, with generous length wires.
B00KF1UYPK|5|It was what I wanted.
B009YN2NOU|5|Beautiful shield.  Easy to install.  I'm 6;2&#34; and wish I would have gotten the 9 or 10 inch  in hind site but that was on me.  Lets a little more wind in that I would like at highway speeds since I chose the 8&#34; but I do love the low profile so I guess its a reasonable trade-off.  Make sure not to over torque the screws when tightening them up.  The base (or whatever it is called) that the windshield screws go into on the back side of the fairing is plastic.  Harley sell brass replacements for a couple dollars each that thread themselves into the original stripped plastic threads.  You would think for a $18K+ bike they wouldn't skimp and use cheap plastic for something like this.  Oh well, be careful and it won't happen to you.
B000JZYTLW|5|Perfect fit for my 2000 Lexus RX300, should fit years 1999-2003 RX300. Sounds OEM, not loud at all. Install it along with their catalytic converter and this will be an easy job to install.
B005G5SD7Q|5|Love these grips! I get compliments all the time. These are much thicker and fatter than stock grips which to me is a great thing no regrets at all on this purchase
B00VGL86SU|5|great product  great price  fast service
B00GG9FGO4|5|Its great, wish i had found it long ago;
B001MYWBF0|1|Used it for about a week, then stored it for a couple months.  Next time I needed it, the cooling fan turns on but the display remains blank - what gives?  How do you even return this after the 30 days - the return policy should cover this for more than that considering it's from Amazon LLC.
B0058TF7EM|4|good net. well sized for the rear carrier
B001CEG90I|5|This beats the $70 the dealer wants to install a new filter.  It doesn't require any tools to install and takes maybe 5 minutes, mostly to cean out the glove box.  If you aren't sure of how to replace these filters check out YouTube.
B00J26AVTI|4|Look nice
B004MSYQBU|5|works just as described.
B00NGZMBI0|5|Good price and does its job.  Only one I could find for my make of car and size of tire.
B00IUWLZMW|4|BUT It wasn't charged and the voltage indicator doesn't work,.. I checked it out with my multimeter and the battery read 12.87 volts after I charged itGuage/meter did not work
B00IDLO3F6|5|Verry pleased with Allstate Carburetor Kit
B004WNUK06|1|Will not fit a 2013 Streetfighter
B000EQESRG|5|Save myself  money
B007I6K4I2|1|Lousy quality product.  Failed immediately after it reached the 60 day warranty.  Definitely not recommended!  Buy the OEM Part!
B00EC2CG9U|5|They do the work as as expected.
B00PV6VU48|4|The main reason I ordered this set was so when I open my car door the door lights and overhead lights will be BLUE.  Set cam with a free LED bulb in addition to others.  Company responded when contacted.
B00GSG6QZ8|5|What more is there to say?
B008MISF54|5|way cheaper than the boutique oils that run $20 a quart
B00VS8JMBG|5|Thank you. Just what I needed. Thank you vary much. Paul
B00LIDY5HW|5|Super Cute
B00A1XGR4E|5|Genuine Toyota part---cheaper than Fram Filter
B00S70VMWU|5|Jeep runs great
B00P03Q8F8|4|Did what I needed. Very happy with product.
B000C57M0O|5|Installed in my '99 Chevy suburban K1500. Installation was pretty straight forward. Good product.
B009FUFBTG|5|Great
B000AM8BLI|5|Fixed my taillights that had burnt out due to being old. Quick and easy fix!
B00OMITGGA|5|...I promise all potential buyers that any bad review is due to user error.<br />This thing works like a friggin dream!<br /><br />  I noticed some folks saying it's too small for their hands, but this product isn't supposed to be GRIPPED with your hands like a traditional steering knob. You are supposed to use this with the PALM of your hand, and your fingers flat out, so they stay out of your way.<br /> I drive a very small car with no power steering.  I became disabled after I already had my car for a year so I bought a steering knob to get around that fact. It helped but kept coming loose. That's not a problem with this one! I LOVE this thing.<br />The ONLY possible problem I can foresee is if your steering wheel is too small or too big for the rubber inserts to make a perfect fit. And you NEED a good snug fit for it to work safely and not kill everyone else on the road.<br />REMEMBER, IF YOU ARE NOT DISABLED, THESE ARE NOT STREET LEGAL! DON'T GET CAUGHT USING ONE WITHOUT YOUR HANDICAP PLACARD ON HAND!
B00NGEOSPK|5|Solid chain great price
B00K5527EW|1|This stuff is absolutely terrible spend a little more money and buy film that comes on a cardboard roll.
B009J2J0SI|4|These worked great for my old town ocean tandem!  The only complaint was the pins that hold the pads would work out of place.  I used epoxy to hold them in place and it's been a year and still working great!  The straps are easy and secure!
B004BTGY10|1|it says it fits a 2001 Silverado but it doesn't wrong pattern for the plug
B000CSS65Q|5|The Brand is Called OEM..  not OEM (Original equipment manufacturer)  part from the car manufacturer.  A bit misleading, if you havn't been around the aftermarket part seen as myself.  Dropped this in a 05' scion,  fitment was great and took care of the bad sensor.  No complains from me.
B00JMUKIHO|4|fine
B00C3Z9Y0W|3|This is a patch not a repair. Follow directions and work really fast once you mix the product.  The end result will look like a patch but it's less expensive than replacing tub/shower basin.  Be sure to wait 12-24 hours before getting wet.
B00JBICRY4|3|great fit looks good, but the wire harness for the hi and low beam was wrong, i had to hard wire it to the car.
B00RKHQY1K|5|pretty good product. and fast shipping
B00R6LZWGI|5|Seller was prompt, product is great.  Took about 2 hours to install on a 2015 F150 -- most of which was due to the fact that I opted to remove all of the tie down brackets and reinstall them over the rug (not hard with the right tools, just slower going.)  I also purchased some heavy duty double sided tape at Home Depot to supplement in spots I felt were a bit low on &#34;stick&#34; -- particularly around the tailgate.  Fit was good and the result, I think, is fantastic.  Very comfy, quiet, and durable.  Matches pretty well with my leer topper headliner in grey.  Would highly recommend.
B00HVI8S7Q|5|I bought this because the key fob to our Honda Accord broke where it attached to the key ring.  This fixed it perfectly.  I wish I had found it sooner.
B004BCJJO6|5|Perfect fit. Fast shipping.
B0028JLO3I|5|Love it! The extra coverage was nice with kids in the background
B00ECHN0O0|5|our drivers like them since they last more.
B000GD5FMY|5|Fits well, not bulky, keeps wind out, good price, 1 for day & 1 for night.
B001LL9UQ2|1|Very Crappy, broke after one use.
B000VS8DZU|4|Quickly delivered and as advertised.  Works well.
B0090SLJ5S|5|Awesome look, gets really hot though
B00E9FKZN4|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B005ZWN5FU|5|For the price I could have gone to Walmart and got two sets of these rubber floor mats but the Camry white logo is impressive so I dished out the extra money. Mind it, I am a cheap Desi so forking up almost $70 was a stress. I hate people people that are nagging because it sold as advertised. I almost did not buy it reading some of the reviews but I am glad I bought it. It gives very nice look to my Camry.  I am just talking from cosmetic standpoint it has not gone through a Winter of snow yet. so my review might change next year. I will upload some photo too. If I dont get too lazy. Mind you I am a desi.
B0051TPJKG|5|I have never got to use them yet but they really handy to have around just in case
B002M1SQ24|5|Used for an oil change on an 09 altima, I had to get the old gasket off with some flush cutters from harbor freight.
B002T4Q0X6|5|Great shocks that installed ok.
B00HTOB0NG|1|I have a 2011 odyssey and the DRL warning light is showing. So I thought this would fix the problem but it didn't.
B00278MET8|5|A++++++
B0087Q2JJY|5|its all balls what can ya say. you know their reputation when you buy it
B00493WZSE|4|I broke the tabs on my original trunk release button when installing my door speakers so I needed a replacement. This is exactly the part I needed for a 2013 Camaro. No surprises.
B00651CFEW|5|Was a little suspect that this antenna would actually work very well, but so far I've not noticed any drop off at all in reception.  It does bend a bit in the wind, which is kind of weird looking, but as for signal reliability, I have no complaints.
B003CJJ8L8|1|This only made my helmet smell like my elementary school gym. Sweaty. Stuffy. Not fresh.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Parents bought this and are super happy with the results
B00KHUQ9NK|4|Item is nice but not a great fit for my 1996 full size Bronco.  The lining tore while installing it.<br />UPDATE:  Seller contacted me upon reading my feedback/review.  They processed a refund immediately - NO QUESTIONS ASKED -  (offered to send another if that was my preference).  I'm very pleased with the way the seller handled my dissatisfaction with the product for installation in my vehicle.  I wish this was a better fit for my Bronco as the product seems great & the customer service is quite good!!!!!
B00FG9J4TS|5|It's a gas cap!
B000GU3402|5|Very happy with them ( got two ) connectors were a little loose quick pinch with pliers fixed this
B00B5KB1IY|5|GOOD
B00076V63C|5|The grille was exactly as advertised. For those leaving one star reviews if you had read the description, you would have known it was for INSERTS ONLY!
B001O957TK|5|Just as described.
B00BSFZQCI|2|They are not as good as I thought.
B00CT9M1IE|5|Awesome tool<br />Makes life easier
B003VLBPJA|5|does what it's made for
B00H55X5M8|5|Simple install. Works great and is much Brighter than stock light.
B004BGN0L0|5|This product works very well & is especially appreciated since I'm not allowed to wash my car in the traditional manner at my housing complex.
B00T6JJ606|1|I purchased these to be able to work on small tight spots on my BMW motorcycle, and specifically because of the magnetic nut holder idea; I intended to turn the driver with a small open or box end wrench in those tight places that every motorcycle has.<br /><br />My rating is one star because these are useless unless one is using a power tool to drive them. The non-magnetic end, the shaft that would go into the power tool jaw, does not fit any of my wrenches, and so the driver cannot be turned with anything but one's fingers:I tried all of my smaller open and closed-end wrenches and not one of them can be used to turn the driver.  The smallest wrenches, 5-6 mm, are too small to fit the shaft and the the next size up is too large.
B00GTIH5PA|5|Very good!!!!
B001IGEG8M|5|I needed a fashion bungee cord to hold my purple yoga mat onto my new dutch vintage bike. I am the coolest biker in town and get comments all the time!
B004GJ4KHA|5|Received even faster then expected. Very pleased.
B001G8AIMU|1|Dont waste your money on this. Buy a motorcycle 2amp trickle charger. I use the sealed lead acid batteries and have tried charging them with this thing. Junk. It doesnt charge. I used my motorcycle trickle charger and a solar charger and within a work day the batteries where charged and ready to rock all over. This charger is a complete waste of money.
B004M3F5CO|5|Works great!<br />I used a butter knife as well as a towel and the sticker came off with ease.
B001KS2PYK|5|Easily installed and works great
B00Q6QDMH0|4|The part is as described, but I ordered 2 sets, was billed for 2 sets, and only received 1 set. The description very clearly states that a set is 2 clips. Will buy product directly from manufacturer next time to avoid getting ripped off. I'm worried that even if I return the product, I will only get half of my money back. UPDATE - The company reached out to me and is making it right.
B00UHD4HJA|1|Absolutely crap.  Talk about bs stickers. 3 skateboarding stickers and the rest including Homer Simpson, YouTube, Skype, and bunch of crap stickers that has nothing to do with skateboarding/snowboarding/surfing.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this horrible sticker set.<br /><br />Oh and to add injury to insult is that they only shipped half of what I ordered.  Also the shipment came from China. Enough said right there.  Don't buy!!!
B00OLVGGZM|5|This fit perfectly in my husbands F-150 platinum bed.  It is well constructed and a great value. It was delivered extremely quickly!
B00KJ17Y2C|5|Installed this over the weekend so I can't attest to its long term performance but so far everything looks great.  It was easy to install and is very bright.  I think it is a good value for the price.  Almost half what some competitors ask for comparable units.<br />I was surprised at how heavy it is, more than 16 pounds.
B005FCZ7JM|4|Great looking o's fast delivery
B0073W281W|1|does not fit 04-08 f150. Will not reply to my messages and is wanting to charge me for a return.
B003END2VE|3|I have been through 2 sets,  they leak and rust internally,  looks good for about 6 months then it rust and stops working, I even went so far as to tape up and seal the ends of each tube with no avail
B000BRFWWI|5|Matches the OEM equipment aboard my boat exactly!  Happy to have found the replacement.  Easy to use, clean, tailored looking, and just right!
B005FIHDN4|4|great
B00L1Z5NNC|5|Works Great.
B004FFHJ14|5|I had concerns after ordering this that, since it didn't seem to have any visible insulation properties (like air bubbles) that it wouldn't work as well as the cheap one that I've had for years.  However after getting it, I feel it does just as good a job if not better. It fits the window like a glove!  I would recommend this product.
B00UO9OAGC|5|worked
B00557LMYG|5|Great price. Not a difficult install.
B005KOZ25Y|4|It recognized my car, unlike to ten dollar Bluetooth version I tried. Not the best build but if I was a pro I would buy professional equipment. The USB is a waste because it is not supported anymore. But for $25 not needing to go to the parts store to view the trouble code, it has paid for itself in one use. Now for the repair, start with a new gas cap as mine dose not tighten.
B0002SR4Q8|4|Bought the Lisle oil filter wrench in anticipation of removing a oil filter from a riding mower that was coming up on maintenance schedule hours. Glad I had this wrench. First time filter removed, new mower. Was on rather tight. This wrench did the job with no problem. Took a second to figure out to open the jaws for it to fit over the filter.
B007TY40ZQ|5|works great! I can use the window again!
B00B1FQJV2|5|Fast shipping and handling, just love the car seat... they fitted so well on my 2005 toyota rav4... becouse of their youtube video demo..no hassle in install process.
B000WJEY8S|5|Works great for my Generator to know when to service, easy to install.
B00X3J1BGW|2|Nice light but u need a harness and pin connecter that Harley sells in the led kit 6800105 comes with pin connecter and they won't sell it separate
B00MB0E21U|4|I love the color, I love the feel, and the quality is great! The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because it does make the steering wheel feel much bigger. I drive a rogue and it fit perfectly and looks really good! Like I said though, it makes the steering wheel bigger to grip but the memory foam and softness makes it better and you get used to it. I've only had it for a few days but if I have any further issues I will definitely repost! BUT I LOVE IT!
B000CO86BY|4|Little light for a large SUV.  If you have a large SUV, get bigger stands.
B00MOE9IRG|1|Agree with most of the other reviewers, the inlet and outlet ports are smaller than the OEM, do not buy unless you want to put new smaller tubing on your ride
B003B3GX2C|5|Purchased this because a normal trailer hitch was too low for our boat on my Jetta TDI Wagon. Works perfectly. Just note that it comes our farther from the car than a traditional trailer hitch would.
B0017UBHQS|5|Excellent
B01015DJ4W|2|does not fit a 1994 regular cab without new bulb sockets for the cargo lights and major mods to the wiring. the housing does seem to fit somewhat to the body. not as tight as the original would not buy again\
B00MJ7U0FC|1|terrible looking, not anywhere close to look like carbon fiber
B00ARJNR7M|2|Quality is not the same as OE. Though sure wish they were, as the price was great for 2!<br /><br />Out of the box 1 was bad, plugging it into the abs sensor connector caused fault.  (ALWAYS do this prior to install, quick way to test).<br />Swapped with the other one included and it worked.<br />Testing with meter showed ohms were way out of spec, which triggered the fault.<br /><br />Second issue, check the sensor end length!<br />The nose of the sensor was 1/8&#34; too long and does not fit correctly. It just shoved the nose into the reluctor ring and destroyed itself.<br /><br />So out of a box of 2 I now have none :-(<br /><br />Ordered OEM AC Delco and problems solved.
B000786GLM|5|Easy to use and seems to hold up in a variety of metal on metal uses (manual typewriter repairs and small fan mount in electronics).
B00I9SK8XY|5|Great Stuff!  My black vinyl boat cushion was cracked and peeled down to cloth backing. I brushed on three thick coats and had a soft pliable patch that matched the feel of the original. Even though my brush strokes were not very neat the surface is smooth and blended in with the original.
B00NRBPSGK|4|This is a sick decal! Looks great on my matte black half dome. A little pricey....but all in all a decent deal.
B00S24EVOM|1|The material is low quality. You can mess up your pants. See the pic attached. This pic was taken after a 15 min ride. U can see the black marks on the jeans. Horrible. U can ride only with black pants :))))
B000C2Q2EO|3|Perfect reproduction of a really bad design
B00KM6IA3Q|5|I use as needed
B00429NKWK|3|got the job done, but could have saved myself some money, it is just because stuff you could find at home depot or any hardware store
B007JSGR9Y|5|It's not professional by any means but with this tool and some knowledge about cars you can pinpoint what's wrong. It pulls and erases trouble codes amongst other things.
B004A6NB1U|5|Saved big time by changing it myself!  5 minutes, no tools, done!  I found the how to video on YouTube.
B00DLMP978|5|Sweet, a must have....fits my new cx-5 perfect, thanks amazon for another fine product !!!!!!!
B000W0PMN8|5|Excellent. Thick, long and flexible good quality cable for very less cost.
B00BBMD2O2|5|Great lights, Bright. Very pleased with this item.
B0016J3GA0|5|Quality, direct fit, working fine. Don't forget to clean ALL reused parts, if too worn better replace them & bleed brakes well when you do your brake job. Happy trails.
B0042Z0XWY|4|over priced, I found it cheaper else where
B008YFU3F0|5|I love it it met past my expectations
B008LP8SLE|5|I'm buying this this payday! First time I saw it I pulled in behind a truck in Home Depot parking lot. I laughed so hard I could hardly walk to the store. Yes its disrespectful and God sees as one reviewer said but God isnt afraid of truth. What this man well, male  pretense has done to America and pretended to  be a christian the Lord sees as well. I'm not too worried about standing before God because I don't like the antichrist's servant Barack Obamation. Wish they had one for cars too I'd even put one one my fourwheeler. The Hillary one is good too.
B008BMQYGI|4|Cheap plastic. But went with my theme.
B00DTEFSWY|3|too short to chase main cap threads
B000C5WCN6|5|The product was a great product. The plug end was wrong. Thank You
B0007WJRF0|5|On the Tacoma, the bed narrows near the back, so this cover looks a bit off. There are 2&#34; of the black plastic rail exposed near the cab, but at the tailgate, the cover almost goes over the side of the rails.  Its normal because of the way the bed is made.
B0006IX87S|5|fantastic filter.  works as well as some that I have purchased for 3x the cost
B000C544X2|5|A problem solver should install themselves.  Moog makes the best mousetrap.  My last set lasted six years on a lifted f-350.
B00ABQJMVG|1|The picture shows the Star Trek symbol upside down and if the decal is actually made like this that is just plain stupid.
B00ARJQTYK|5|Low cost, but worked perfect on 2005 BMW 330xi. No more hesitation, misfires or check engine lights.
B000TCCWS2|5|Thanks
B002C3IH4Y|5|Bought these for my Challenger SXT. They make the car look perfect! They took about 1.5 inches off of the stock ride height. If you want to go a little lower I would recommend the Sportline Springs, but if you're worried about scraping or bottoming out I would get the Pro-Kit. Not only does my Challenger look better with these but it handles better too.
B001DBVPY0|4|Has given me about 2 extra mpg and seems to tow our travel trailer a bit easier.  Looked at a You Tube video before installing and it was pretty straightforward and simple to install.  It was amazing how much plastic from the OEM intake that was removed!  Also has a nice sound now as you accelerate.  So far no issues.
B001EOV492|5|Great ball mount!! Curt products are great.
B0002SRGXY|5|First class pice off kitt. More than able to do the job
B00BFWJZUI|4|PRO : The gloves fit well and are very light. They are approved for NHRA motorcycle drag racing which is why we bought them.<br /><br />CON : (for drag racers who run hand slider clutches) The gloves have  large seams inside the finger tips. If you snap the clutch out with the end of your finger tips like a lot of us do, you will find these gloves really dig into your finger tips. We have size medium and large and they both have big seams in the finger tips.
B000EQR7XS|5|ok
B00DO7FKJW|3|My order was receive on time as expected , the holder is great and I was happy That I didn't have to hold the tag every time I went thru the Ez-pass line but went I try to stick it to the windshield the suction  cups did not stay on the glass, needless to said that I was very disappointed. I have to go out and fine better suction cups for my EZ-pass holder.
B002AKFA94|5|Perfect for what it does. No problem.
B00065L2D8|5|Iam very happy
B00GBRWMSE|5|Showed up in excellent time & was exactly what I ordered. These pins are wonderful! Much better than the standard ones I had before.
B009DK0HD8|5|Came early,fit perfectly and worked very well. the price was lower than anybody else. I am totally satisfied with it.
B000KYV8WU|1|would do minus stars. lock smith said worthless. would not even take for free he did all of mine for 98.00.
B0016IV2S4|5|Awesome! perfect fit and function
B00L5DXZIK|5|The first time I went for a ride on my DR 650 I was totally amazed at the mileage increase. The ride that was about 214 miles and I barely used 3 gallon of gas averaging almost 70 mpg! It's since then dropped down to about 65 mpg, which is still better than the 58 mpg I was averaging on the stock plugs. I've only put a barely a 1000 miles on the bike but so far I'm quite pleased with the overall performance of these plugs. They are a bit expensive, but if they last the amount of miles they are supposed to last as well as the mileage/performance continues, what a great invention/ investment!
B004LX3AXQ|4|Kinda fancy for me, but having a lithium battery for motorcycle its a must have. Works well. Small
B0043DJVPA|1|Not well made purchased a set on May,26 installed & on 1st trip out the tit on the top broke loose. All air leaked out because of crack so had to re-purchase the 1 air-bag on June 15 for $ 137.69. And then in July same thing happened again with the tit. So they are not made strong enough. It's now happened twice. Same identical thing.
B00F0M617O|4|High Quality stainless steel chrome.  Almost marine grade quality.  Not very easy fit.  required boring out holes that were too small or not in right position.
B0067EYM8O|3|They are pitted bad after a few yrs.
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Fit as good or better than WeatherTech for a little cheaper.
B00LFZS77M|4|The lanyard I recieved was actually not the same as pictured here, but I still liked the one I got. Y'all should update your photo with a correct image
B00GDXMGJ6|5|Very easy to install. Looks great. Everyone comments on it. Nice quality
B0006JLSNI|4|An adequate hose that does the job and good value for the price.
B009XBKWUU|4|Its okay.  Its an oil pan
B00CEXKBN2|5|perfect fit and looks great!
B00LH05Q88|5|This is a surprisingly high quality tool, with thick steel on the base and mirror finish chrome.  I used it once so far and it fits the filter housing perfectly. I definetly recommend this tool.
B008EG66BO|5|This filter was an exact replacemt for our 2011 Toyota Sienna engine air filter.  The price was right and quality was on par with the oem part.
B000CF1WB4|5|Great price for OEM product. Replaced old ones and instant gas mileage improvement along with smooth idle. The threads come with anti seize compound applied to them as well.
B00YI3IGA6|5|These ShadeSox Universal Car Sun Shades are super cool to have even if you don't have kids/babies. My fiance has lunch out in his car and it's been pretty hot and brutal these past couple weeks so with these sun shades it helps keep the sun out of the backseat which helps the car to not be as hot when he gets in it. The sun shade is easy to put onto your car window for most cars since it's universal and while it blocks out the sun/heat you can still see out of it easily. This sun shade is much different from other similar products because it allows you to roll down the window without having to take it off so if you need a nice breeze it'll definitely work and it'll keep flies or other insects out of your car. We really like it and would definitely recommend the ShadeSox Universal Car Sun Shade!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**
B0087NB53S|3|Great for making radio into Bluetooth for headset. POOR battery life
B00OZ1GKI6|5|Good price and good cuality I'm happy
B00VWK6LDC|2|Small Unique design, but too much effort required to install with little to no instructions based on the model/year of the vehicle.  If it included instructions for specific vehicles it would be much better.
B001804TQC|5|quality construction on this item. Lowers exhaust noise a decent amount and made very well.
B003UVCY00|5|great light
B00P1RU8PY|5|Easy to use JBWeld, works well.
B000BQW5LK|5|Perfect price range worked geat.
B002IA1O6Y|5|I love my lights. They have been hooked up jet.  I will like to Thank  You for  the package on time
B006H34AE6|5|We have cushions on some patio furniture that we just can't get the fur off from our dogs without removing and washing (what a hassle).  Well, that was true until we purchased this brush.  This thing is awesome and removes every little bit of fur.  If fur is a problem, this will make your life easier.
B003LK2GNU|4|cracked over time.
B001GN1K18|5|worked perfectly
B002UJVNFA|5|They fit well
B0000AXPDU|3|Cheap quality and I think it would be easy for a criminal to break it off if they wanted to. It is a good deterrent though
B003CH577Y|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B003UXZ6RG|4|Nice quality and feel
B000A8OK6W|5|Good fit and easy install in my Toyota Tacoma.
B0045LCBE8|5|Perfect !
B0041TRTTG|5|our pt curiser had never had a filter or maybe someone took it out and did't replace. i like the idea of a cabin air filter to keep misc big items out of the blower/fan area and misc bugs etc.. perfect fit.
B00GQ2X4TU|5|Nice weight and sturdy.  It looks great on my car.
B000MK2CB8|4|Great but be careful, there are nipples in the chassis (98C5)  that contacts and might scratch or destroy it
B004CZZ2CK|5|My old starter was starting to make funny noises and my mechanic recommended a new starter soon. I checked and ordered one from DB.  Removal and installation was easy once I figured out how to get the right socket/extension/socket handle on the bolt heads.<br />The starter cranked the engine much faster and starts almost instantly!<br />Slight problem- the starter would only crank the engine 2-3 times then heat up and not work at all ( I figured bad relay). Sent an email to DB and within the hour had a response: RMA approved, replacement shipped.  Two days later back under the truck and 30 minutes later my truck is happy again.<br />Highly recommend the company and the product.  Been 3 months now and no issues.
B00GBBEJ4U|5|Works great and helps keep things from moving around while driving. Easy to install.
B0008MGIG0|5|Had these on over 1 year in 'Sunny' SWFL.  Constant rain and these withstood it with no problem.  I am buying another set when these wear down (on month 15.)  I like cool things to add to my vehicles, and these definitely add style.  And they had withstood a BEATING of downpours and rain days!
B00MLKCGHC|5|Great Helmet without the &#34;NEW HELMET&#34; smell
B008BX634K|5|Work perfect! These little LEDs are super bright. and what a vibrant color. I have a green neon light in the back of my truck, and these are way more  green than the neon tube. I will be buying more to replace the neon and add more elsewhere. Great quality!
B004YJU5S0|3|Actual lift ends up being about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 on  a 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab. Rides good. After a few months, the springs settled to the point where front gap between top of wheel and fender is 1 inch lower than the rear. That means the total lift is about  1&#34; to 1.25&#34; lift. A lot of trouble to install for such a small amount of lift.
B00XAX4B9A|5|Great product!
B003ZOLC8M|5|Worked well, as advertised
B0002F69EO|5|the best for black streak removal compare to other products tried.
B00LKXVAMI|5|These gloves are amazing. They fit awesome and they provide a lot of comfort when riding. I actually bought these for mountain biking and I couldn't be happier with them :)
B008EXHNZA|5|My original was jammed up with what was left of the float for the guage that had turned into dust from the bike sitting for 8 years with the same gas in it. This part did the trick.
B00N052IRU|5|Slightly different than stock gasket, but seems to do the job just as well
B00CFQQMM2|5|the compressor fit in the Jeep  look a glove, works great
B00AOTKT8A|5|product is exactly what I need and shipped very promptly
B004JO3VQI|5|Work great. Exactly perfect for my VW Tiguan. Work excellent.
B004J3266U|4|Wish there was at least a half of a sheet with at least a diagram. But after a bit of head scratching it was rebuilt and runs better now.
B007UHPSAS|5|These sun shades look just like the picture.  I have a Dodge Intrepid and they fit pretty good in the window.
B00WITMN06|5|Does its job well
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Love it.  Fitment is really tight.  Works well with OR-FAB bumper.  I highly recommend.
B007FLD4RI|4|great replacement bulb, much brighter than regular bulbs.
B00FKFJ330|5|It works.. it's cute!
B00V4049K2|5|Great product add works well.
B0028NB1SM|4|Glasses work as decribed but they seem a little weak, like they can easily break. However that remains to be seen. They do fit well over my eyeglasses and I will definitely use them.
B00DOS0SOI|4|A decent spray detailer, although not great for dark colored vehicles. On black cars it leaves streaks even when diluted properly and wiped nearly immediately (in a garage!). It's super affordable though, so simply for that reason it's good on light colored cars.<br /><br />Personally, I would not buy this again as my car is black, although it is a decent product.
B00FALVU9Y|5|This is my favorite detailer.  It leaves a super slick surface.  It smells great!  It works on all surfaces.  I like this product WAY better than the waterless car wash stuff they sell.  I use it in the house and anywhere I can find an application for it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B007Y34V3S|5|Great fenders, work perfect in my boat!
B000CMEIBS|1|It doesn't fit a Scion xB 2008
B00I9IP1MM|5|Love them! They look so good and fit perfect in my car!!
B005I5UAJI|5|Cool keychain. No problems!
B0043QYE0O|3|Wound up not needing it eventhough Fumoto site said I needed it for my particular vehicle.  Installed fine without it.  Oh well.
B000C9GC8I|5|Remember that you'll have to use a T55 torx bit to remove the caliper screws.
B00279KO6C|1|IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE FILTER FOR THE 2007 HYUNDAI TUCSON!<br /><br />TO RETURN IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF MY TIME. THEY SHOULD CREDIT MY AMAZON ACCOUNT!
B0009JB7GI|4|Works well and does what it says.
B001C6GBSG|4|quality part, reasonable price.400 miles  no problems. fit my 2005 jeep wrangler tj
B00KTICUQU|5|Very good.  The &#34;panic&#34; button is a little more sensitive than before, so I accidentally set it off more often.
B008WFPCDA|1|Cheap pieces of chrome plated plastic. Not going on my Coupe!!
B00S8JL81K|5|I ordered this after my eBay order it came first quick shipping great product thx
B001TI5IIQ|4|you have to use it every year to keep the headlight looking clean. otherwise, it's great.
B001VYX3DU|4|I have a 1980 Toyota 4X4 and this was a little big but still covered it just fine. Item was shipped very quickly.
B001DRDVPK|4|Pads are great, but reused the original Spring clips since they fit better.
B00DORP0C4|5|Shipped quickly. Perfect fit. Does get as hot as the case unlike the plastic cap, but what do expect, it's metal.
B00R52USZI|5|Front went on in about 1 hour. Back took a lot longer. But it went right in once I dropped the CV Joints and sway bar. I like it!
B00FRQL0E2|5|Worked Perfectly on our 71 Super Beetle
B005CWABCI|4|was very pleased works very good, and was shipped quickly.
B00ML7G5X6|4|These are really nice and super bright. Both functions work great. I give it 4 stars because of how they fit. I can only comment on the 3157/6 bulb size and receptacle. These bulbs do not fit as snug as the cheapo bulbs from your local auto parts store. It could be that they have so much extra weight compared to a small glass bulb and filament. After seeing a bulb just floating around in the housing for the millionth time I started working on getting them to stay for good. ( I installed these for brake and turn signals in an 08 Chevy Colorado) The little nubs on the side are supposed to provide friction to keep the bulb in place. Unfortunately there are no clips or springs. So applying a drop of glue for a permanent fix or carefully applying tape to enlarge the nubs will solve that issue...
B00G2T6O30|5|I bought this because as soon as I put my white ez pass on my brand new car I hated how ugly it was on the black windshield. Completely distracting when I looked at my mirror as well. I did what other reviewers said, I bought some black (make sure they are black on both sides) heavy duty 3M velcro strips and took off the 2 suction cups that came with the unit (super easy to take off). I attached one strip of velcro to the back and it looks fantastic on my windshield. Doesn't rattle AT ALL and the best part, it actually works through the tolls every single time (I've had it for about a month). Totally worth it, even friends and family want one.
B005NLQAHS|5|Got this because I had the service engine light pop up and was curious what caused it. A friend had a similar device but then I saw this $24 device that connects to my Android phone via Bluetooth. Turns out the code thrown off is related to my thermostat which may be temporarily (or permanently) stuck in the open position. Based on this particular type of problem I felt comfortable resetting the code to see if the problem reoccurs. Well, so far so good, so I'm hoping the thermostat just got stuck open one time. (I just drove 8 hours and got great gas mileage so at least right now it looks like things are working fine).<br /><br />This device plugs right in to the dash and connects via Bluetooth. I'm using the &#34;Torque (Free)&#34; app which is what the product directions mention. It took me a little while to figure out how best to configure things in the app but now that it's finally all setup I have a bunch of screens which show all kinds of information including air temp, coolant, voltages, many statuses, etc. as well as the error codes.<br /><br />I paid $24 and I must say that I'm impressed.
B003ELL6JQ|4|Great item
B00DB3OEOQ|5|Genuinely surprised by this product.  I am always looking for better ways to take care of my car and I was a little hesitant about this one at first.  I saw a post on it on Slickdeals and figured I'd give it a go.  I watched a quick video and went to work following the instructions on the bottle.  2 oz per gallon worked great for me on a dirty/dusty car.  It was nice to save on water and I really liked the wash then dry immediately concept as I like to make sure the car doesn't get water spots after washing anyways.  It did a great job of removing some caked on dust gave the car a nice shine.  Once this runs out I will be ordering the larger size.
B00199N4CW|5|Perfect fit
B001LHVOVK|4|Don't buy this spend the extra few dollars and get the MS309.<br /><br />Does not read manufacture codes, get the MS309
B002FS9AS8|5|I have a 2006 Lincoln Navigator with 140k miles on it.  I am told that 2006 was the last year that Lincoln put air ride on all 4 corners of the Navigator and after that only put them on the back.  Over the winter I discovered that I needed to replace the compressor after it refused to run on a particularly cold day.  That led to the discovery that my truck had a slight leak at the seals on the front air struts.  The dealership wanted a ridiculous amount of money to replace the seals and I was concerned that a new compressor might overwhelm a set of 9 year old air struts so I opted to remove the air ride and convert to conventional.  I work for a company with a very large Ford Fleet so when looking for a solution I spoke to our mechanics who recommended going with Monroe.<br /><br />I was able to buy the front and back set of Monroe's Quick Struts for less than any of the well known &#34;conversion kits&#34; which are basically the same thing.<br /><br />It has been ridiculously hot in Texas lately so I decided to punt and hire a local shop to install them for me.  I paid them $250 to install the full set, front and back.  It took a mechanic with a lift and the right tools about 2 hours to do the job, maybe a little less.<br /><br />Just like I had read in many forums, my Navigator now sites 1.5-2 inches higher than it did with air struts.  Personally, I think it looks better sitting a little bit higher.  I recently drove a new Navigator and the height is pretty much the same as what mine is now.<br /><br />I have put about 2500 miles on the truck since installing these including 1500 miles of highway going to FL and back.  I asked my wife if she could tell a difference and she could not so I take that as a sign of success.<br /><br />I can not tell any difference in how my truck handles in traffic or on the highway but people are more likely to grab a handle to pull themselves in when they get in now.<br /><br />I have not addressed the &#34;Suspension Switched Off&#34; message on the dash yet as all of the instructions that I have found from the &#34;conversion&#34; companies involve cutting wires which I am completely against.<br /><br />I honestly think that this conversion just extended my ownership of this truck 3 years.<br /><br />The pictures are :<br />left/right before<br />left/right after<br />Alert you get on the dash after turning off the air suspension<br />close up of the back after<br />close up of the front after
B002VVNXCI|5|Oh what a wonder sound these slip ons brought to my 2015 Street Glide.  Product looks good, sounds good and was delivered on time at the right price point. Sold by Powersports Parts and fulfilled by AMAZON!
B00KGNUVHS|3|Took a while to ship. Was disappointed that one of them was bent right out of the box.
B00M3NEBMK|4|This is not a review comparing it to other balaclavas, as these are the only ones I've ever even touched, much less worn or used; this is only about the two balaclavas I received after purchasing them.<br /><br />Item required several (hand) washings to remove smell and taste. Provides sufficient head cover. Does not interfere with hats. Interferes greatly with spectacles (both worn and seen). Material feels acceptable, but haven't had them long enough to be confident in sturdiness or durability.<br /><br />Washing care tag was very difficult to remove (tore out stitching on one of the masks)<br /><br />Photos of the mannequin head used here are creepy.
B003NOFGUO|3|Great looking product, unfortunately not the right fit for our 2013 tahoe.  Also showed up 2 days earlier than it's estimated delivery date.  I returned the emblems and received my refund about 5 minutes after UPS picked it up.
B001PNC5CW|4|good for changing water sensor
B003CEFJ2A|3|faded to ashy white within one week out in the sun.... its only cosmetic but I've never had any of my wetsuits made same material do that, not  until a few years.<br />other than that it does what its supposed to.
B007Y867DA|5|Good price.
B0007XTGCI|2|- Base is not wide enough....it's a little scarey if your jacks slide or shift<br /><br />- Max Height is about an inch lower than my Arcan stands<br /><br />- Saddle (top of jack) really cannot support wide loads properly----example &#34;Car Axle or Trailer Frames&#34;<br /><br />They're cool looking and the quality seems okay but they don't give me any confidence putting my load on it
B00HJ6O4A0|5|DEFINITELY A HANDY MAT FOR THE BEACH OR FOR PICNIC.<br /><br />THE SIZE IS JUST RIGHT FOR CARRYING, AND IT'S EASY TO OPEN AND CLOSE.
B00306X3WS|5|Easy to install and works as advertised.
B00I53VU8A|5|I didn't use all the seals, as I only had to seal up a prop shaft leak, but this did the job.
B001CF6LVE|4|Bottom line, you get what you pay for. It's a cheaper product compared to others, so I don't think other reviewers should be complaining. This is a thin protective piece of fabric that wraps around my spare nicely. I have a 31&#34; tire on my Jeep, fits fine. My only gripe would be the tightening strap; it works, but once it's under a heavy tug (what I would call roadworthy) it seems to want to slip and loosen up. To prevent this, I simply tied a knot just before it. Holds fine now. May not buy again, but overall a decent product for the price.
B00A80GED4|5|ABOUT TIME TO REPLACE OUR BATTERY BACK UP BATTERIES....THESE ARE EXACT REPLACEMENTS!! HIGHER AMP HR FOR LESS COSTS!
B003TOFNDS|5|Appears to be good quality.  So far it's a good kit.
B003WEB2KI|5|Installed these on an 09 Altima, the most invasive thing I have ever done to a vehicle, installation was pretty painless for the most part.
B008UX68OQ|5|This is awesome and it fits perfectly over our 2010 Can-Am Spyder RT-S.  Looks very nice too..... :-)
B00L2T5R3S|5|Wow great item. Matches the truck color. Was super fast in shipping.  Love this
B0065MY93Q|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B006RYALX4|1|Chrome on the front emblem badge wore off after two months.  On the positive side was relatively easy to install by shaving the pins and relying on the adhesive padding.
B00PT18QAQ|4|From a customer service perspective, this company is top notch so far. Though I haven't had any issues with mine, I received an email from the president of the company the same day I received the pressure gauge. The email solicited feedback on the product. I replied and got a nice note back. The product itself is decent enough, and gives readings consistent with my other gauges so it appears to be accurate. I don't have access to a definitive measuring device so I can't speak to it's absolute accuracy. The ridged black ring around the gauge you see in the picture is rubberized and protects the gauge from drops. My only complaint is the release valve button could be a bit sturdier. It works fine so far, but does not seem heavy duty. Time will tell how well it lasts.<br /><br />To use the gauge, just connect it to the tire valve and make sure you have a good seal. The needle will move and then stay on the reading until you press the release valve. Pretty simple to use.
B001OMVCIC|5|No surprises.  I've installed airbags on my last 4 trucks, and the quality has stayed the same.  The install is easier than it was on some of the older trucks, because these mount inside the coil rather than mounting a bunch of brackets.  Not the first Air Lift kit I've installed, and won't be the last.
B00OPUDDS2|1|Way too small for the money.
B00QLP5IQE|1|Package all beat up and filter is not useable
B0084UJTFU|5|Very satisfied with product
B00BGZ2YD4|5|love the color, fit my fob perfectly
B00GOZZCBW|4|Part was a match with one exception.  The original mirror had threaded screws that fit into molded plastic.  The new mirror came with a threaded nut that I needed to find metric bolts for.  In addition, the bolts were easily found at Home Depot but I had to hacksaw approx 1/2 inch off each bolt.  This added a little more to the job but it still came out perfect.
B00KTJ0NE0|5|Works perfectly.
B0002JN2EU|5|FANTASTIC
B005CGZ5HU|4|works well. it will be great if there was a protective coating or a glass sleeve on the LED's but maybe its asking for too much.
B006TJBFKU|5|Great quality.
B00BAZMHUU|1|DOES NOT FIT FZ1 S 2007
B004Q6N5O2|5|Great product.  Worth every dollar.
B0040Y301S|5|Nice gun
B00QIVZXS4|5|Very good tanks
B0053HOX4O|1|Do not buy this tank!!! Don't buy this tank if it will be exposed to sun and rain. As it is a sealed tank, the heat from the sun causes it to inflate and if it is rained on, the rapid cooling causes the rain to be sucked in around the fuel gauge installation area.I learned the hard way after being towed back to the dock twice.Just enough uncontaminated fuel in the carb and line to get you about one half mile out. Wal-mart has same tank without fuel gauge for $15.00 more. Go figure.
B00713A5OU|5|Simple install works great feels like new.
B001O7PNNM|5|Decent compound, works well.
B000SL0R9K|5|Great first aid kit. Comes with a lot of stuff in it, I would definitely purchase it again.

B00HP94Y8S|5|Easy to install. Looks great; much cheaper than dealer install.
B002ITTGEC|1|I have the Pro Pad Mini Beast 4 Air horn. WE Installed it on Harley Davidson Ultra Classic in January, then in May it went out. Turns out that the heat from the engine caused the seal between the plastic horn and the compressor to melt. So I put another one on in May. Guess what? Now it has the same problem. I can actually move the horn back and forth and see the gap where it melted. After careful study, before We install the next one, we will wrap it with &#34;Heat Shield&#34; to stop this problem. Other than that, this is a fantastic horn. Because my life depends on a LOUD HORN, I'm only giving this one star because the HASSLE is a PITA!<br /><br />Here is the video of the movement of the broken horn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px5LYfDItwA
B003TTL0TE|5|Great mitt. Cleans well and good quality.
B00276D5RK|1|Item not as shown, slightly crushed and poor quality.<br />This is not a &#34;bound&#34; filter but a cut from a larger strip of filter.<br />It lacks rigidity and does not maintain its form well.

B00F9LPL5E|5|I use this in a stereo cooler when I float the apple river in Wisconsin. I get 3.5 hours use running a 300 watt cerwin vega amp with a 10&#34; sub and 2 6.5&#34; speakers, at 3/4 volume on an iPod, steady, [non stop]. Total weight of the cooler is now 26lbs, down from 50lbs when I used a 35Ah lead acid.<br />Absolutely love the light weight! I have a a lead acid 18Ah that gives me about 5 hours use with the same load. I will buy another one of these battery tender lithiums and connect them in parallel to get the 6-7 hours to match the 18Ah lead acid.. The weight is fantastic, and for my need this works perfect. I never expected equivalent power to a lead acid on it's own 2 in parallel will. No complaints here.
B005644G7I|5|Easy to install and enhances your view since these lights are clear and bright . I would recommend to any friend to buy this product. Well worth the investment.
B00NSGCVWI|5|works well
B004C6OBBC|5|nice and heavy
B002U2O7EG|5|Absolutely love my new anchor car decal! Was shipped to me quickly, and was sooo easy to work with! I now, have had it on my car for years. And still get compliments to this day. Hasn't started to peel off or anything! Love it.
B001J5ZXN4|5|Works well but didn't fix the problem.
B0066T99EC|4|Works as intended, seems a little flimsy but so did the stock one. There are beefier aftermarket links around for similar prices.
B000CC4O58|4|Haven't hit a deer since putting these on my car.  I'm hoping that's because of the whistles.
B0065N0XG2|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B007GLCO3W|4|This is a great product. Keeps the dashboard shiny.
B001RKH7FS|3|Just wanted it get far colder than it does.
B006X6MQP2|5|My wife's car looks like new!
B00P57ZEHM|5|perfect
B00JIEX722|5|Great lights and very bright
B000CB7DG6|5|Got my supply for 1 yr thanks
B0007VANJK|3|Good item but does not fit 2004 Tacoma as stated in description.
B000CIFW5I|5|Item was as described and met my needs.
B002XLHUQG|5|Make a huge difference!
B0044B30TO|5|works well, fit well and its OEM. so no worries.
B006ZAPE2I|4|you'd think kuryakyn would be better quality. it fits good
B004RNOW64|1|Not worth the money
B00DPFBM5Y|5|everyone should already know that this IS BRAND NAME BUT NOT BRAND NAME QUALITY, if you are looking for very high quality mudflaps for your very high quality car then go look at some other very expensive mudflaps but if you are looking for something that doesnt cost over $90+ and does what it needs to be done then this is it, there are no pre drilled holes so you are going to have to map it out yourself and mirror it on to the other flap, perfect for the people with personal preference
B000UODUR6|5|Bought to change all the O-rings on my 03 Impreza's AC system.  Fit great, had plenty of o-rings, and my system is now leak free.  Well done.
B005GX3GFW|4|Needs some extra rubber pads
B000KL49MY|1|This product is useless without mounting hardware... Returned for refund.
B00V9CPSS2|5|Seller is very prompt! Excellent quality!
B001R9N41K|4|Great
B00077ZDWQ|1|Fits very loose in the 2 inch receiver, it it unacceptable to me to have my bike rack wiggle around that much.  I had to wrap the shaft in tape and this is just a mickey mouse fix.
B000R9ZYNW|5|Worked perfectly on my Discovery 1 hub nuts.  1/2&#34; drive means that I can use my ratchet or breaker bar without having to keep 3/4&#34; drive tools.
B001XSJI38|5|Stuff seems to really work. I wouldn't bother with anything under the gallon size since you use it so much. Smells good too.
B004RH89V4|5|Good quality emblem!  But didn't think it was so big... it's larger than my Germany metal emblem and that's not cool lol! Plus it's my car.... so now gotta find anotha one that trumps my husbands Canada emblem .... haha<br /><br />Eve B
B0040DVL6U|5|This works great, allows you to see a blind spot on one side of the car that you couldn't see before.
B01125ILQQ|5|Works great!! Perfect fit
B001KS0M5E|5|Good fit and gets the job done.
B003JLJLVQ|4|Easy and quick install on my 2006 ZX14. Didn't have to do any adjusting once put on.
B00681BE2S|4|First one I received did not work...but I sent them an email and they immediate shipped another that worked perfectly so I am very happy.
B0035HAS6G|3|Grips seem good but don't be fooled by &#34;Open ended&#34; thinking they were made that way from the factory. They are cut by someone who doesn't have a steady hand obviously, not a huge deal but I'm ocd and want a clean looking end to my grips. Save yourself the frustration and buy a set of closed grips and cut the ends yourself with a sharp razor blade. Will look way better than these! Grip function is excellent however.
B00MFZYUJU|5|Great Sticker. Stays on securely and is readable from a distance.
B0055B121U|5|Worked excellent for my 2007 Impala. This is a MUST HAVE if you are replacing the Evaporator Canister Vent Solenoid (AC Delco part# 214-3218).
B009MASRMM|5|Very pleased! Insulated, reflective and fits Volt windshield very well..  Temps are noticeably cooler in direct sunlight all day.
B00NNXWLVW|5|works great on our 99 GMC suburban
B00G2TV7OG|4|Nice bulbs.
B000COWXO0|5|Direct bolt in, no issues
B000GU7UBG|4|worked well, instructions suck, good YouTube video's  on line on how to do properly, and some variations on what to block off and what not to. over all had everything to get the job done. overall I'm happy with the purchase. thanks to you Tube!
B007NGB5VW|2|Nice quality but I'm not sure who they are trying to fit these to. I wear a size 6 levi blue Jean and bought an these in XL because everyone said they run small. These were so tight in the thigh when I finally got them zippered, there was no way to squat down without blowing them out let alone get on a motorcycle with them.  On top of that, the waist was so big I could get two of me in there on the smallest setting. Super misproportioned!!! I'll give them two stars because the leather was good quality.
B0031ZDU62|5|:)
B0009NUG66|3|Easy to setup, easy to hook even without a roof rack. Unfortunately, it has already ripped on the seams where the zipper is located. I purchased this carrier for a future trip and finally used it this past weekend, mind you I purchased it back in May to ensure I understood how to use, install and test it out, time-wise for traveling. It's easy, as I mentioned previously. The material feels really sturdy and can take the wind from the trip except that maybe it has some weak spots? Every where else the carrier is fine, but for some reason is has ripped in one area of the zipper. I'm unsure if I can claim warranty on this carrier now as it's too late to return. If not for the rip I would give it 5 stars for portability and ease of setup. I even purchased the non-slip material and hooks since I don't have a roof rack, which is just fine.
B00VK4H75G|3|Its ok.  Much smaller than you would think.  Tough to position, and the QD screw is a pain to get tight enough that the mirror does not swing forward in motion.
B00C7PTD54|5|Love this product. Bought the dark smoke grey avs VentShade for my father-in-law's 2015 Fusion and I liked it so much that when I bought my 2016 Fusion Titanium, I couldn't past it up. With the shadow black paint job I added the chrome aeroskin to my car and it looks awesome!! Easy to put on! Matches the chrome on the front of the car.
B0081ZY73M|4|Very nice wire but it was a tangled mess in the box but it wasn't to hard to get untangled.
B00IO9CK7K|5|Installed these on the wife's explorer and they are great. Very smooth and quiet. Harold
B006V7TBDI|5|I bought these for my husbands truck. When i first saw them i was so excited! They looked awesome and i couldnt wait to install them. He had a bar on the front that we placed them on, on the inside of the headlights right in front of the grill. After some adjusting they were perfect! Extremely bright, perfect for our dirt road travel.
B006B2VPJG|4|2007 Honda VTX perfect fit took 10 minutes to install highly recommended
B000CHJ8C2|5|cheap and perfect fit
B001VMV4JC|5|Perfect fit
B00295EM0S|1|Be careful when ordering.<br />I received Mis-Labeled items from the distribution center in North Las Vegas.<br />I received (2) 1 liter bottles of Liqui Moly 1618 4T 10W-40 Scooter Engine Oil.<br />NOT (2) 125 ml bottles of 1580 oil additive.
B011Q18D14|4|Fast shipping is always a plus but the fact that this product is so accurate is even better, works great!
B007KPX8Q6|2|The Fender was not the correct width as advertised. Spent quite a while shaving down the edges to remove a quarter inch on each side for my Softail Custom (11.5&#34; width)
B004A4ZE7G|5|Perfect fit
B007K22FVS|5|Simple to install, great fit, works well and looks good.
B00PH5LG5Q|5|This vacuum cleaner that has been designed as it should have. I have had the previous models and they had so many design problems. This one has been made so easy to charge (just put it on the pod, no connectors involved). It has been made easy to clean or to deep clean. All the parts seem to be put together and taken apart so easily. The vacuum pressure is pretty strong. I even sucked some carpenter ants into it and took them out and cleaned it out, thereby avoiding introducing pesticides inside the home. I received this with a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased review.
B007RSGQAG|4|Great buy! Exact match to my Honda 2009. Can't get pen to engage tho. Thank you
B004BYIG6Q|4|Hooked right up with no problems.
B008RUINI6|5|Part worked as it should, this was not my issue as to why my scooter wouldn't run right.
B004VTF236|1|Had these lights in my 03 2500 for a couple of years.  Looked great, worked great, but didn't fit very well.  the shape was slightly different than the taillight opening and the fit into the rubber grommets was very poor.  The left side broke the tabs where the screws attach recently and the light fell out somewhere on the highway.  I'm now back to running the stock taillights and looking for another brand of LED lights.
B00JM6N8FW|5|perfect fit
B00469MPD6|5|For that showroom feel and look...not that cheesy armor all shine that looks like a discount auto parts store special
B00I5JIV7W|2|Full kit is kind of misleading and my 6 year old son was helping me and snapped a couple of these while tightening them. You get what you pay for and this is far from oem quality.
B000E243AW|5|Excellent product
B00CQ44I42|4|Not terribly difficult to install. Can't complain. It doesn't look as clean as a factory hitch, of course, but function is more important than form here. Solid buy, and at under $150- a good value. Mine was ~$125 shipped (w/ Prime). Can't beat that.
B0083H5Q06|5|So far so good it hasn't given me any issues worth buying for the price
B006WPQNB2|1|I've had this unit for about 2 years and have been very happy with it until,,,,,, Usage has been very light. I'm sure less than 100 flushes. Now the electric pump assembly has gone awry and cycles on and off continuously. It has emptied my tank twice and killed 2 sets of batteries as it did not do this when I was around the unit. New pump assembly costs 135.00 dollars. Sorry, not at my house. I can easily buy many good porta potti units for less than this pump assembly. Ridiculous ripoff of customers. I couldn't believe that a company would try so hard to lose customers!!!
B001R93JV0|2|I bought this brontosaurus dinosaur sticker, for my fiancés upcoming birthday! I know he's going to love it because he is obsessed with anything brontosaurus. I, however, am not really happy with it. I can't remember if they posted the measurements (so it's pretty much my fault) but this thing is freaking small! Mind you it was only $2 something with free shipping, so I can't be too disappointed. But, definitely make sure you know measurements before buying, on anything!
B00QWYO5A4|2|More like pink than red
B000OUXA2Q|3|Have this in my 48 gun safe in Arizona. Should not be super humid, but I have to &#34;recharge&#34; it in the microwave like every month.<br />So it does what its suppose to, color changes well.
B00T8BJ3TQ|5|Good
B007NQMNUY|5|Very useful. It can obstruct your view if you are tall.
B00WRCLLZ2|5|Just what I needed.
B000E286ZK|5|Little high in price but works great had no problems installing my bike is running great
B001AJH1HK|4|So far, so good. The installation was without issue, but have not yet had an opportunity to road test. Precautions have been taken to prevent loss of either mirror while on the road by additional tethering to SUV. After reviewing feedback from other buyers, I'm not going to risk loss or breakage.
B00H6ETIWY|2|returning do not like the fit sorry
B00HE0NJTS|1|baaaaaaad
B004GC7B1Y|5|ok
B00EQ1PVLW|2|TOO CHEAP...GET A BETTER ONE
B00F89VJ1C|1|Old no glue
B00KTJVFU6|5|Perfect fit
B0006IX87S|4|Works satisfactory
B00BFE45X8|5|Works as advertised. Perfect fit.
B0006PY0M8|5|Looks awesome installation rather easy all though it says put rubber bumpers on vehicle i placed them on bugflecter
B00HD9RUUO|5|Nice 5 minute install
B0017THMLS|5|Feels good<br />Doesn't get hot in summer<br />Simple design<br />AWESOME price!
B00CJHCXD4|3|These mounts r well made fit my 97 Honda civic but vibrated like hell
B00L6MOWPU|5|Love this key chain! Its perfect and exactly what I was looking for to detach my car key to give to valet!
B00EPJDQF8|5|Love the lights, got them for my w220 mercedes and they work great. Easy installation, only took me about 15 min per light and quality is amazing! Super bright I don't even need to really use high beams anymore on unlit roads!!! Best part is it's pure white and not a white with a hint of blue like 6000k
B004TOB5CU|5|went on in a short time...sturdy nice package!
B006B28896|5|Great price for product that I used for many years on various mororcycles. These pads work great for track bikes and don't fade over time like  stock pads.
B00FWOKKGI|5|The light is bright is bright and I haven't had any issues with moisture getting inside the light and fogging up.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Nice kit, was great lightening deal on Happy Prime Day!
B00WVJR0D8|5|Light exceedes all expectations. Great beam pattern on high and low. Clean and white color. Put it in an old 1986 Venture Royale. It did fit behind the housing, but not a lot of spare room straight behind it. Now my bike has an old reserve lighting module from the factory. If low beam goes out it switches to high at a lower voltage. And turns on a light out indicator. This did trip the module. But I expected that. It may be CANBUS safe but Opt-7 could not be expectes to account for 30 year old technology. I took out the factory system and rewired to a plain circuit. Works fantastic. If longevity is there, I do not plan to ever go back to incandescant.
B00ZVJ2WEM|3|great product just didnt like how the seats were sepersted
B00V5RA476|2|I purchased this to install over the front chrome bar on a new c7 corvette.  It looks cheaper than I expected and the adhesive isn't strong enough to hold.  Ended up not using it.
B00E7NO606|1|Took long and was the wrong part.
B00065TSRK|5|Works great and smells awesome. Works better with pumas, I just don't like the sand all over the place.
B001O19INO|4|it would be 5 stars if the cap came with the hole in the handle like the oem caps (to connect the gas cap hanger).  I drilled out a hole and it seems to be working well
B000JZN0CQ|1|Didn't fit my car when it said it would.
B0017T7WHW|5|The benchmark lift for emergencies.
B00F81MCZC|2|Overall good quality, came wrinkled which made it harder to apply, the fact that the picture is black which is what I wanted and it came in a default color of white was complete crap. Maybe you should change your default color to black or change the picture to a white one??? Two stars cuz it's good quality and came fast.
B0090IRKUG|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B006EI8OM8|4|This front is a rear? One or two?
B005OV44DE|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Terrain.  No adapter necessary.
B00CO2QQQ4|1|I ordered it because I had to replace the fender for an 04 Honda Civic Si, and they were gonna be needed to reclip the plastic shield around the tire. But they were too large! i already opened the package so I can't return them either! How unfortunate
B001OMLE4E|2|Anyone else have trouble getting this on over your top? Going to try today leaving it in the sun but I shouldn't have to remove the soft top hardware to get this to fit.  Am I doing something wrong?
B004A08CN8|1|Bought this bearing because of the price, of course, and installed on my 06 Pontiac G6 and the sounds of a bad wheel hub didn't go away.  In fact they had gotten worse with a brand new bearing.  Took it to a garage and they had said that the new bearing I had bought and replaced was bad.  I was hoping I would be one of the lucky people on here that haven't had any trouble with these bearings but that didn't happen.<br /><br />I didn't take the time to send this one back and receive another one so I'm not sure if my next one would have been bad as well.
B00XJWLIC0|5|Great product for the cost! Buttons are a little sensitive, but nothing major. Installed on a 2005 Chevy Aveo LS hatchback and I love it! I have absolutely no experience doing power lock conversion kits, and it worked excellently for me! The wiring wasn't bad either. I do recommend having someone professionally double check the wiring. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the fact that the kit is presided for an alarm install. Now all I have to do is wire the alarm to the control box for the locks and my alarm will lock and unlock my car! Genius! It cost me $40 dollars for my tech to check my entire car. So for $80, the iSaddle kit and professional checking of the wiring, my car has power locks! Happy girl :)<br />Attached below are photos of another guy's Aveo same make/model as mine. I attached my actuators the EXACT way and it is working lovely. First pic is how to attached the front doors. Second pis is how to attach the back doors. Good luck!
B0009IQZFM|5|I was skeptical about this leaving the car streak-free, as I have other microfiber towels that don't.  It was very nice to find that it worked as advertised.  And, it dried so quickly in the sun that I was able to wash a second car and use use it again later the same day.
B00BXMRP4I|5|Very pleased with this pump!  As other reviewers pointed out, if you are using this with automotive R134 systems, get this adapter to fit your hoses: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JMF98?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44.<br /><br />I have used this pump once.  Very quiet and pulls a nice vacuum.  Instructions are not very well written - Apparent that the writer does not have a great grasp of the English language.  But it's enough to tell you what you need to know.  You can't beat the price of this pump!
B0085YBJ6C|1|Garbage product! Not built heavy enough. I recommend getting the solid billet ones offered from other companies, or if u have the means fabbing up your own out of square tubing. One side completely broke and the other cracked a 1/4 of the way. Save your self the time and headache.
B00E1JJ85O|5|Works as described. Fits perfectly in my Scion FR-S.
B007VGFZEM|5|Looks Great ! Good Quality.
B002BHWZFI|3|I used this on my motorcycle helmet shield, and although it did appear to reduce the fog a little bit on cold morning commutes, it did not do the job well enough to recommend to other riders.  I have not tried it yet on my scuba mask or eye glasses.
B00MAV0XVS|4|Arrived before expected...size was just right..nice jersey...was hard to find an XXL.
B00EZMTPDM|1|The top part or this case was made wrong or something and it won't shut. I looked up a video on how to do it so I wouldn't break it but still it didn't work. I didn't return it just it was so cheap
B004PRZ5JU|5|Fits perfect and looks much more dressier, like its part of the furniture.
B000C30J1A|5|Can't argue with the price or the quality of this belt. Took care of the squeaking & squealing instantly
B000EQVYA0|5|perfect fit
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great product for the money, quality materials used.  The eight ties take about 20 minutes to cinch down.  I don't have cross bars on my vehicle and this still worked for us.  Plan well because it is tough to get into the top after it is tied down.  The rain didn't get in and I didn't hear much vibrating from the straps (which i had to tie off myself) or material.  Perfect for us.  After using it, I'm glad I don't have to store a hard top carrier somewhere.
B008Y2RZ7W|4|Nice quality!
B00A0GN3R6|5|Nicee Key chain.
B000CNAXTI|5|Seriously, the easiest install ever. Under 10mins.<br />Amazing difference in quality over OEM stuff.<br /><br />Now the transmission actually stays where it should, an no more vibration problems on my 99 Yukon 4x4.
B004K9I25C|5|Replaced OEM part with this one on my 2001 Suzuki savage. It works 10 times better. Original part is about $80 vs this much cheaper and better alternative. My bike no long has a problem with getting fuel into the carburetor causing the bike to shut off. The vacuum suction the other OEM part has causes problems once it goes bad. This one is a straight flow into the carburetor; on, reserve, off, very simple. Just make sure to shut it off when you're not using it and seal the opening where the vacuum hose runs to on the carburetor. Easy install. Great product.
B00K889FCI|4|This is admittedly a difficult product to review. At the end of the day, I'm reasonably happy with the results. I knew going into this that it would require a healthy amount of elbow grease, and it does, so be prepared. I spent about an hour and a half total sanding, but my headlights were pretty far gone. My biggest beef with the product is the included mini sanding pad. (about 1.5&#34; sq?) I don't think it's a realistic amount of sandpaper for headlights that really need to be restored. I ended up going to the local hardware store to grab some extra 2000 grit, which sped the process up considerably.<br /><br />Really, what you're paying for in this kit is the soaked pad of chemicals that you spread on as the last step. Everything else is throw-in stuff. I was seriously skeptical; even after all the sanding i could muster before full-on depression set in, my headlights still looked oxidized, yellow, and crappy. I applied the chemical pad in a very &#34;oh well, lets just do it&#34; mindset. To my surprise, the brightened up more than I expected. Are they perfect? No. Are they improved? greatly. You can still see the oxidation line across the top if you're close, but they pass the 5-foot-away test, which is more than i could say before. Now, how it lasts will be another question....
B000765MHI|1|This did not work as described. Barely gives any air on high setting. Tornado, I don't think so. I breath more air than this pushes.
B0024E6TQY|5|this is a direct replacement for the notoriously bad regulator on Forest River's Solera RV's.<br />Easy to install and works like a charm!
B00OBSWO7Y|5|JUST GOT MY FLAG DECAL (07/29/15) AND IT APPEARS TO BE QUALITY MADE AND BUILT TO LAST. I PUT IT ON THE BLACK RUBBER PLUG THAT COVERS MY TRAILER HITCH (1 1/4\\"). IT BEING A LITTLE LARGER IN WIDTH THAN THE HITCH COVER STILL WORKED OUT SINCE IT IS MADE OF A METAL LIKE COMPOUND, WHICH CREATES THE 3-D APPEARANCE. ONLY TIME WILL TELL HOW WELL IT HOLDS UP TO THE ELEMENTS AND NOT TO MENTION CAR WASHES.. I'LL POST UPDATES LATER
B00O3QBFSS|5|This is awesome.....money well spent!
B00BGC6KJ6|4|Nice add to my auto tool kit.
B0024ECC3S|5|Good quality and easy to install - even has a little trap door on top so you can turn the propane tanks off without removing the cover
B00PV5CXP4|4|These have been great for my car, some of the edges had some wear and tear but I just cut some of it off and they still work great! I also like the fact that if there is dirt or anything I can take them out of my car shake them off and spray them down and they look almost new.
B0031BUYOW|1|Didn't last two rides and resistor fell off. This is  cheap made and I would not recommend any one buy it.
B0077FINY6|5|Fit like a glove on my 2002 Jeep Liberty. Has been working fine for about a month. AC is kicking cold, woot woot!
B008SANL5A|5|Love love love it!!
B00IKPFQNS|5|Excellent price.  All functions worked perfectly.  Only minor detail is wiring harness is slightly longer but that's not to bad, still tucked in under dash fine.
B0009IK9DG|5|5 stars
B00KP35ZHA|5|Looks nice.
B000IYEMNY|4|Items arrived on time as promised and packaged really well.  My mechanic installed them after I couldn't figure out for the past 6 months why my car was making weird noises-in particular, the front wheels and vibrating the lower chassis. After changing tires, doing a front and rear wheel alignment, and cleaning brakes the noise was still there! Finally my mechanic suggested i get the wheel bearings replaced- honestly I didn't know car wheels had bearings, so i ordered these through amazon and a few days later had them installed and voila!  No more noise and vibration was gone too!  My 2006 Xterra felt like new again!  Only gave 4 stars because I've only had them for about 2 months- will update in about 6 months time.
B00S05MSRK|5|Love this organizer and I like the way it accordion closes when not in use.
B00Y5HLC8S|5|Good
B002305A1E|4|A cheaper mirror that will give you some rearview capabilities. I say some because they are NOT convex mirrors, but they still do some good. A lot of the comments are saying that they are too loose and flop all around. I don't understand because you can tighten the ball joint so it doesn't move. There are 3 or 4 nuts to tighten doing different things. Like screwing tighter to the bike or tightening the ball joint. The trick is figuring out which one is which.<br /><br />I bought one of these a month ago to test it and then I just received my second one. I have mine tightened down pretty snug so I can still fold them out of the way for offroad riding.<br /><br />The only thing to worry about is the vibration with the mirror. Which is mostly from the bike at faster speeds.<br /><br />I ride an xr250l.
B000XBCURW|5|Worked great as advertised
B00C5TJATQ|5|It's McGard so nothing else needs to be said.
B008G3KCHE|5|Best buy on these parts.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B00NFANPCC|1|sharp edges, for the price, to be expected
B001GJ3E2K|4|Nice brush. Does a good job of cleaning wheels, at least the spots it can reach.
B002E5ATCI|5|Check this part before assuming the issue is the main relay. When the ignition switch was in the run position, dash lights and all had no power. Of I held the key in start pos, everything has power. I've used this brand many times before with no issues on quality. Be careful around the yellow harness. Disconnecting it can deploy airbags.<br />**EDIT** 3K miles later, still going strong with NO regrets. I'd recommend this part to friends/family
B000BZG8ZU|5|ok
B00496RDVA|2|The part was not the right part for the vehicle.
B00BN4630S|5|Great quality
B00M78820I|3|Too small for a Toyota Corolla.  Functional still, but I should have gone a size up.
B00KLZ65GM|5|A1
B00EQ2X6GI|5|High quality and fit (and look) great on my GX460.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Easy to mount, remove when needed, and remount. For the price, happy with my purchase.
B0072UHPR2|5|I purchased and installed this on one of my Passats for the purpose of attaching a bike rack (a Swagman XTC 2-bike rack).  The hitch was fairly easy to install (I've installed these before on other vehicles), and required no drilling.  Once installed, it seems to be very sturdy, and I'm sure I could easily pull a small trailer if desired (and if I added a wiring harness).  I attached the rack, loaded my favorite bike and my wife's favorite bike and went for a test drive.  I was amazed at how stable it was - and how good the ride quality of the car was.  I'm looking forward to taking this on some longer trips - and I commit to come back and update this review based on those experiences.

B010H0QV7S|4|This review is for the 5 in 1 gauge.<br /><br />Included with the gauge are the instructions.  Although other reviews indicate watch type batteries, the gauge I received requires 2 AAA batteries that are not included.<br /><br />With digital tire gauges in this price range (currently 13 dollars), I don’t have high expectations, especially after trying a digital one a few months ago that was consistently 4 pounds off. This particular gauge is a multi-function type with some features a bit better than others.  For me personally, while it may be convenient to have a multi-use device, I normally prefer a tire gauge to be just that, mainly because it tends to function more reliably than multi-purpose devices.  This gauge has a flashlight on the end, a red LED light on the underside, a flip out window breaker and a seat belt cutter.  The gauge has a power switch that allows you to turn on the light of your choice, either the red Led or standard light, depending on which direction you push or turn the light off completely.  The lights work fine for finding the tire stem in the dark helping find a lost tire stem cap or something like that.  I am not sure of the additional benefit of the red led over the standard light but I guess it could help contrast something you drop in the dark.  The glass breaker has a switch that when pushed flips out the pointed metal hammer end.  Although this seems a bit lighter than the standard glass breaker and  I can’t test this on glass, this does seem like it would work for breaking glass in an emergency situation.  The seat belt cutter is located in the slotted end of the handle, the blade in comparison to others I have used was surprisingly dull and I could not get it to cut paper or cardboard well and I doubt will cut a nylon seat belt.  Could it be I received one with a defective blade it is possible but I am not sure I would rely on this cutter prior to testing the blades sharpness.  For me, I am more concerned about how accurate this device is for air pressure.<br /><br />Turning on the gauge is accomplished by pushing the power button just below the display.  To change the measurement type on the gauge, just tap the power button to change either to PSI, BAR, KG/CM2 or KPA.  To turn off just hold the power button a few seconds.  When powered on a blue backlight for the display comes on for easier viewing.<br /><br />Having had a bad experience with a different brand of digital gauge, I tested this one on multiple tires on two different cars and use a reliable analog gauge to compare the results.  This gauge read consistent with my analog gauge within a half of a pound each time I tried it.  So I am satisfied that it is at least as accurate as any analog gauge I have.  Like most digital gauges in this price range there is no way to calibrate it, if the reading gets inaccurate.  The tip of the gauge is made of plastic and removable by unscrewing, I presume, for replacement if it breaks.  Although I don’t really expect in this price range, I would prefer a metal tipped gauge.  The tire stem is also a bit short in some circumstance and I would prefer a longer pressure stem or one with a hose attached to make it easier to use.  The handle makes it easy to grip and is fairly comfortable otherwise to hang onto.  The body of the gauge like the tire pressure stem is plastic and well and most likely won’t hold up to rough treatment or extreme conditions.  Because of that, this is more of a home or occasion use type of gauge.<br /><br />For a budget level gauge, this is fairly accurate in determining tire pressure.<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

B00BSXJT8M|3|Replaced the servo and looks nice but the service light is still on so money wasted
B00B1VBQRS|5|stopped the pinging after about 20 miles. very satisfied with all Royal Purple products!
B00VB2OJLW|4|Great cover
B00725WTRI|4|Was a gift
B004GCGSAY|3|Excelente
B002ZBWKAU|1|Item delivered was not as pictured.  Returned.
B00NFEYH5M|5|My hubby loves this little gift!<br />He's had the set for a couple of months and the valve stem covers still look like new. The keychain &#34;tool&#34; tightens the covers on just right enough that they're very difficult to remove by hand. But, with the tool they come right off.<br />As a keychain, it's comfortable to carry and light enough that you don't even know it's there. He likes having the VW logo and it's a fun talking point when people wonder why it's shaped that way.<br />The order was fulfilled by Amazon, so it arrived quickly and safely. I would highly recommend this as a great little gift item.
B008G1WVO8|4|Headlights looked great after installing them. They did need some of the plastic trimmed on the back to gain access to one of the mounting bolts, the oem lights had a contoured shape to allow access to the bolt that these did not. However it was not much of an issue. Very satisfied.
B00GVW3OS6|4|The first package arrived open and empty, but the seller promptly reshipped no questions asked.  The color match looks good.  The issue for me is that it's difficult to use the pen when it's near vertical with the tip in the air.  This is an understandable limitation and can be worked around, but a brush on application for small spots requiring vertical application would probably be preferable.
B00029JKI2|4|Works well once you figure out how to install it.
B00391FOSK|5|My AC/heat was only blowing at my feet. Replaced the bad one<br />Works great!!!<br />Very easy to do.<br />Don't go to the dealer I saved myself $800!!!!
B006N933F6|5|Easy install, part looks like a quality part
B00INIK13M|3|Nice looking jacket, comfortable and breathable but don't expect any protection. Feels like any other flannel jacket with a bit of air flow.
B00496F0HY|5|Works great, easy install and priced right!
B010MNR3Y0|1|Easy to install and look great, quick 5 minute install.<br /><br />Update after being on for 30 days I am standing next to my truck while my friends were saying how great it looked. With no one within 10 feet of the truck the tail light cover just fell off. Product looks great but you do have to do some customization (new silicon seal and sealant to get it to stay together).
B00PBAK34C|5|Good
B00HR39P18|2|Lowered my 2003 Ford Expedition about 2&#34; front and back as described but I then would constantly bottom out in the front. Not sure if it was the coils hitting together or if it was my strut bottoming out. Either way I removed them and put the stock springs back on.
B00W5MG8XY|5|Tire gauge is accurate, tough, and sturdy. The light is useful, and hopefully I will never have to use the seatbelt cutter, but it is there just in case. Pressure gauge works upon receipt. Light requires an extra battery not included
B001LRJHFK|4|Ok for the price
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Sweet deal, and cheaper than any installer out there. Came quickly, in good shape, and nothing was messed up at all. It took me a while to install, but once I did, I was a happy camper. Have had these on for a couple of months with no problems.
B006H34BUY|5|thank you
B000WJYMMQ|5|alot more heavy duty than I expected
B00O870QRS|2|Would have liked to give more than 2 stars, but when installed on my 2015 Ram 1500 4X4 it created terrible wind noise.  At speeds above 60mph, the antenna created a whistling that could be heard noticeably inside the cab.  I couldn't believe it was actually the antenna, but it was the only change I had made.  Removed the antenna, replaced with the original, and the whistling was gone.
B00V7GHVL2|5|Very pleased. It gave my 2014 Tacoma a whole new look.  Very pleased !
B00J1TJHSW|1|Cheaply made. Terrible customer service.
B00BCRMAAS|1|HARD TO FIT YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON CHECKED AND SAID THEY WOULD FIT...VERY HARD TO FIT<br />TOO SMALL. HELP
B002Z34VOQ|5|works well
B002P8QGW6|5|Perfect fit
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Perfect! Lotsa fun to fold, too. But is really does the job.
B000CAVLKQ|2|Arrived with no packaging except large shipping box for multiple items (parts flopping around loosely) and only came with 2 of 4 spark plug tube seals.
B0008FUH46|2|very hard to lock and unlock
B00HL5AHDM|2|had to return it did not fit my trailer
B00CBFTBA2|5|I get a lot of comments about this decal and the other two I have made by Team Promark, LLC (IU & Colts)...great product.
B005FL27QY|4|Great parts - absolutely a worth while purchase. Be sure that these are compatible with you vehicle model and year. The rotors are surprisingly good quality, and the pads work perfectly with them to achieve fantastic stopping power. I noticed a difference immediately after installing these. My repair became more than I expected when I noticed damage to my calipers during installation. I would honestly recommend getting calipers, and the brake pad brackets in conjunction with this kit to complete your job with all new parts. (Yes, it's more expensive and you'll have to bleed your brakes but an all new installation with make for an easier and more reliable repair).<br /><br />Anyone complaining about these parts either installed them incorrectly or got a bad batch of parts (seems unlikely though).<br /><br />I've had these on for a few weeks, and if I come across any problems I'll update my review.
B007TO3Z02|5|Worked as intended
B000Z0HVHA|5|Iam very happy with my purchase
B0097JQ9B4|4|Great material, easy install, looks good  just a small gap and impression made me give it only four stars.
B0028JW4PU|5|Works for both a low clearance car and a large SUV.  Perfect for my needs.
B00XWP356G|5|Nice and smooth on foot, doesn't mark up shoes when changing gears. Excellent piece to add to my Harley Davidson. ...looks great!
B002IBFUNG|3|Yellow not as vivid as I would have liked it. I get comments on how nice they look and they do work fairly well, but the yellow is more washed out as I would have liked.
B0076C8WLE|5|perfect
B00F8PLZQK|5|Had a bad wheel bearing and decided to replace both sides since these are half the price of most other parts I've looked at. Parts shipped fast and were exact fit for my '07 Cobalt LT. Seem to be of very good quality.
B00DMEFH7W|5|Was a bit difficult for me to put on the back seat covers. Need extra hands to help. The look is perfect the fit is fantastic and really happy with my new seat covers
B000ALG86E|5|Very good car cover; durable and the fit is great
B00TYZKX04|5|Perfect size.  Easy and quick to put up and take down.  (No bashing the passenger with folding the wire hoops!) 🙋
B001OBKIWY|5|Works great for me.
B000C9H7BE|5|Perfect fit oem rotors
B00A82A2ZS|5|Used this as a replacement in my Grandson's John Deere tractor.  Worked perfectly and was about 1/8th the price the toy company wanted for the exact same battery with a plastic blue strap on it and a wiring adapter.  Take the adapter off your old one and use it on this one.
B00NAUKYU8|2|Had these for 2 months and one of the amber lights quit working.was going to try to get it swapped out but the message said not eligible for return,I would recommend buying ones with a warranty
B00195JNA8|5|Product was exactly what I needed and worked great!
B00FRHOLK6|1|Worked for about 5 months and still works...just not the end of the wiper that should be wiping the streaks from my line of site. like 25% of the wiper does not wipe even my washer fluid spray away to where i can see 100%, it's maybe 60% visibility, or i scoot my chair lower...<br /><br />very disappointed... i will look more closely at the negative reviews when purchasing more wipers.  maybe the 24&#34; is not made as well as the 18&#34; (which i gave 5 stars)
B000CB6ADS|5|easy to install.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Works Great
B00UZ211VU|5|Great
B000P0ZJIS|5|I changed valve seals on my Lexus 300 and the tool saved me a lot of money. Relatively easy to use.
B002VVIC06|5|Works perfect
B009G4ONJK|5|Comfortable. Fits wonderfully. Love the built in sunshade.
B00HD9UKPG|5|oem quality
B004A6JA2O|5|It fits my Camry SE 2012, thanks
B006YHWCKO|1|Not the correct size in the posting
B0067BPC68|5|ok
B001EOWR3Y|5|Perfect for our trailer hitch really reduces the slack.
B00397NQ0C|5|it no joke this stuff look awesome n can take a beating as welll
B00SX5604E|5|I have really enjoyed this product in my car.  It keeps the console clean and that is what I was looking for when I purchased this product.
B000C2WIGK|4|Still can't get an answer to my question. I am  trying to remove my AC unit from the 89 Wrangler 4.2 engine. So a pulley must go there to replace the ac to keep the wide serpentine belt going. All I get is this pulley.  There must be something else like, brackets,bolts and a grooved pulley to go in the ac's place.  Anyone heard of this problem?
B0042TTIYO|5|Great
B00496U4ZW|5|Perfect fit
B00B9ESDSM|5|Great service!! Great product!!
B004I12424|5|Watched Youtube video on how to install and took less than 10 minutes to install after that.  Even came with light bulbs already installed. Works great.  Identical to the original drivers side rear tail light assembly.
B00P1JFWVM|5|I purchased a Philips daytime running light kit back in 2012. After a little over two years, the controller stopped working. I was hoping to find a replacement without having to buy an entire DRL kit. I'm so glad I chose the iJDMJOY Universal Controller. First off, it has more features than the Philips controller. It also plus directly into the Philips lights (you have to bend the electrical contacts, but the connection is firm) so installation is really easy if you already have the Philips DRL system.<br /><br />I particularly like the fact that this controller dims the DRLs when you have your headlights on. The Philips controller shuts them off completely. The iJDMJOY controller also leaves the DRLs on for 15 seconds after the car is turned off.  On my Honda CR-V, the DRLs  come on for 15 seconds whenever I use the remote to lock or unlock the car. That bothered me a bit at first, but it's nice having the extra illumination when looking for the car in a crowded parking lot.<br /><br />This controller can be wired to turn off the DRL on one side if that side's turn signal is on. My DRLs are far enough away from my turn signal lights that I didn't bother wiring it that way, but it's nice knowing the feature is available if you need it.<br /><br />I've had the controller installed for almost two months now and am still very happy with the purchase.  I may buy another to control some other lighting.<br /><br />If you want to add daytime running lights to your car, I think you'll be very satisfied if you choose this box to control them.
B00HQRVA9U|5|Great handle covers for the price
B005VKLGUW|1|I am trying to replace a battery in my remote entry car key when I stripped out the one screw on the device. I then bought this product in case I broke my original trying to replace the battery. I began to use the screwdriver when the tip twisted rendering the screwdriver useless, now I have to either drill out the screw or go to the dealer to fix this. Completely wasted my money on this product.
B00BCRM9RM|3|Looks good but really difficult to put on. Instructions were not clear at all. Based on the picture the zippers were supposed to be on the inside, I put them outside so i could fold the seats down but it makes the pattern a little off .
B00HXJGXMK|4|Nice look to the pipes, easy to install, sound was not quit what I was hoping for. Over all nice would recommend them to others.
B0039OFZ3Q|4|When I bout my 91 Xj it still had the factory shock, which was in horrible condition, then I went from 29's to 33's and bought this RC shock, and I couldn't be more happier and satisfied. Also helped cure my death wobble and most of the instability I had in the front end. I recently went off reading and accidentally thrashed it. But Im definitely coming back for a rebuy. Size of product to big to wrap your fingers around and touch
B00GNG9N30|1|Battery life is very disappointing. The battery will not hold a charge after less than a year with only occasional use to inflate tires. Last thing you would expect from a jump starter - the battery is no good.
B004AHB2HE|5|Cheapest battery I ever found for my 2005 Hayabusa, and it works!!!! Got sick of blowing $100 every year on a new Yuasa or similar battery.
B00QGPTAXQ|3|Good light color, not a great fit, not a bright light.
B00OVBTKKU|5|Product was received on time.  Shipped in a padded envelope which to me is NOT adequate packaging for such a sensitive electronic item.  Was paackaged in an anti static material.  Both LED assemblies did work properly however.  These ARE very bright and may well be 800 lumens AT THE EMITTER.  That last part is key.  Unless otherwise specified lumen output is generally taken at the emitter.  You will then have losses due to reflector design, lens design, etc..., so every vehicle will be differenct. Thus what starts out as 800 lumens may be half that &#34;out the lens.&#34;  Please also keep in mind that our eyes do not see increases in light output as you would expect.  A 50% brighter bulb will not appear 50% brighter to you.  You may see only a small difference.  That said, these LED &#34;bulbs&#34; installed in a 2015 Santa Fe Sport made a significant difference in both visible light and also much better rear vision camera use at night.  I would place the tint in the 4,000 to perhaps 4,500 range, meaning that there is some blue in there but it is not offensive.  It is very important not to touch the electrical contacts during installation as any static electricty charge may damage the lamp assemblies.
B003U662NU|3|First off the jacket is definitely a summer jacket which in my case,  safer riding with more Protection than just a t- shirt on.  The only bad thing about the jacket is that the button on the sleeve broke the first day I wore the jacket. Other than that it what I expected for something less than 70 bucks.
B005EI7Q3C|5|awesome! thanks!
B003RF8VEC|4|My wife says it is really worth it. I got her the 9x11 AirHawk2. Two important things it did for her 1.Helped eased the pressure points for the long hauls 2. It created great air circulation to prevent sweating and then a rash. We went over 600 miles for the first time use. Even though you won't get 100% comfort but 95% is great. The complaining was a lot less overall. So I would recommend this for any passenger. Well worth the purchase! I never used it for myself but I'm sure I would enjoy it to. FYI the proper air pressure is key. Less air is the best. The rider should barely hover over one's seat.
B00480BWCI|2|Total bust. I managed to crush four of the blocks.<br />Don't use for any purpose other than parking the tires on the blocks. No jacks allowed.
B00M9WUBBA|4|Phone connected to blue tooth works great behind a loud Harley at 80. Intercom works pretty good between rider passenger. Have not tried rider to rider to see range. Wish colum was louder but I have a half helmet and not 3/4 or full. Not overly impressed with Velcro mounting but I am also mounting it to fabric. Do t know longevity or durability. Only used for 6 hour cross country ride. Happy it will connect to both phone and other headset at same time. More time will tell..
B000BW8LQW|1|Absolutely terrible!<br />Ended up tossing them and getting a set from Autozone
B00LI14Y7U|3|I bought this in February, and in less than 6 months the elasticity wore out to the point where it's not usable anymore. When it's new and tight it's fantastic and looks amazing. But for ~$7 it doesn't last long enough to be worth it. I would probably only buy this again if they were $1 each or sold them in packs of ten for the same price.
B00170L4UC|5|Fit perfectly!!
B0091B5338|5|It fits my honda civic 2014 perfectly. It looks like very good quality filter.
B0086E2Z46|5|Good
B00BCRMBGQ|5|The Oxford 17 pc Set Flat Cloth Mesh by OxGord is a great alternative to the pricey car covers that you can purchase form an auto part store or even worse--- the dealer GASP.<br />Look<br />The 17 pcs set is great. It comes with a steering wheel cover, the cover for a bench, the cover for a bench back, several headrest covers, several bucket seat covers and a nifty carrying case.<br />The set up<br />At first, all of the straps were very weird, BUT of course, me not reading fully, at about 20 minutes, I found hooks. My dad and I used the hooks to to make sure after putting the bungys strings on the hook in the back, we secured the ones that seem to not go anywhere to the back of the seat. Putting on everything was a snap. Then we put on the head rest covers and made sure they were tucked under the back so it looked like one seamless cover. Attaching the bench cover was great because instead of leaving gaps where most covers would do, they use zippers to make sure the belt buckles come through .<br />All in all, the covers make  it look like a brand new car. Please make SURE you ask the seller questions and make sure it will fit you make and model of car.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
B001WB8UZS|5|Excellent.
B008VJES28|5|Great seller. Recomened to all buyers.
B000C5YD0G|5|Direct fit to 98 Mitsubishi Montero. Do not forget that you need a special tool to remove existing one. Works just fine.
B002PUTC0M|5|Excellent, big, easy, heavy-duty gauge and nozzle. This thing makes it easy for not only me, but my wife and two girls to fill their tires. It may sound crazy, but it makes filling tires fun.<br /><br />There is nothing flimsy about this tool and I guarantee you'll be a bit surprised at how big it is. Regardless, it was fairly easy to install the batteries (unlike what some other reviewers have said) and it looks like something that will last years.
B00XXKZXHO|5|This came quickly and well packed was just what needed perfect for cleaning car as for the suction.but those was a bit short but replaced it easily with an old vacuum cleaner hose used their ends changes well on wall. thanks
B0024NSR4C|5|These took years off the look of my car. They only took a few minutes to install and they have absolutely met/exceeded my expectations. Love them!
B00B9F5Q86|5|Great bumper and customer service. Had an issue with the bumper but the company fixed it right away. Would buy again.
B002UC8MJW|5|This works with the Camp Chef Big Gas Grill , 12ft of hose is nice ...
B00AVA2DJA|5|If you're frustrated with the new &#34;safe&#34; gas cans that California made the entire country convert to, then these jugs are for you. As you have doubtless experienced those new &#34;safe&#34; gas jugs are anything but safe. I've spilled more gas with them than I ever did with the old jugs. These are available because there's a loophole in the new law that allows &#34;racing&#34; jugs to be simple jugs without all the crazy stoppers, breathers, valves, etc. that the new gas jugs have.<br /><br />These jugs are top-quality and heavy-duty. They have simple screw-type breathers, long heavy-duty hoses, good O-rings, and a PVC pipe cap.<br /><br />Buy them. You won't be disappointed.
B0073WDPEQ|5|Fast shipping and perfect fit. This is a great product!
B007ZDIXY0|5|the are really orange you can tell on the pic
B001GE3Z1K|5|Awesome product. Cooled my 6.5 turbo down by 10* 0n Mountain climbs just by adding to 50/50 mix
B000UKHHQ0|5|DOES WORK ON 2009 AND NEWER. I just installed this beauty on my 2015, so do not listen to the &#34;Does it fit&#34; BS on the Amazon page. This is amazing. I wear a size 12 Alpinstar Tech 10 ( super stiff MotoX boots) and it is awesome. Shifting was such a chore before, and really had to be thought about and I kept missing the 1st-2nd shift and then would catch and downshift accidentally when I was trying to slide my foot under to up shift. This IMS upgrade was easy to install and holy cow. If you have a size 11+ I would say make this a top priority. It makes shifting so enjoyable instead of a chore.
B00873J0YY|2|Anyone who wrote a review saying these are sturdy have not been on the Interstate in high cross winds.  After 10 hours mostly on the interstate, one folded driving at just under 80 mph with side winds of 16 mph. Not sure how fast the gusts were since the weather app did not say.  I bought two sets and was carrying two 10 foot Sun Dolphin excursion kayaks at 41 lbs each.  The 7 hour drive two days before was with no wind and I could hardly tell they were on the roof.  They fit secure.  Only issue was the cam straps would slip a little and loosen up which I'd have to re tighten at rest stops.  The drive home was much windier and I could hear and feel the difference then suddenly the driver side kayak shifted in the front about two feet to my left.  I had to slow way down and pull to the side.  The front Rack bent about 5 inches outward and another inch forward from the wind.  I had to bend it back enough to get it facing straight again on my roof.  This was dangerous for drivers behind me and myself.  I got home and straightened it out some more but it's still bent forward and paint is cracked so it will now rust too.  These are way too light gauge for interstate driving in windy conditions.  Had to drive last 4 hours home at 60 mph just to be safe.  One foam pad was gone after one trip and two others were splitting.  Have had to wrap them in electrical repair tape now. The bolts were too long for my 1999 Toyota Seinna van that it was hard not to scrape up the paint putting them on.  Had to cut them shorter with a cutting disk by an inch. Both my 1998 Honda CRV and 1996 odyssey factory cross bars were too narrow to fit.  The hand tightening knobs don't tighten enough by hand that you have to use a nut and box wrench to secure them safely so these are more like semi permanent mount.  They only have an assembly drawing with no written instructions or warnings about use and safety.  The webbing of the cam straps already are fraying after one trip.  The box  they came insaid made in China.  They assembled rather easy and pieces fit pretty good but had to use a mallet a few times though to get some bolts started that did not line up quite right.  These are adequate for transporting at speeds lower than interstate speeds and in low wind, otherwise unreliable and not safe.  Not worth buying because I now have to replace anyway.  Would probably work fine on trailer in slip steam of vehicle where winds are much lower.  I plan to get a trailer now and maybe try mounting them there.
B00OCEGONC|5|My oil pan bolt was stuck so bad no one could get it off without redrilling and setting a new one.  I instead opted to try this pump to take the oil out from the top of my car. Worked like a charm.  Had to pump it about every 5 minutes but it got it all out with ease.  It is store conveniently in the container for recycling too.  5 stars.
B00O4P9SVY|5|i like this decal, gonna buy another one
B00GWV5AGU|5|I do love it for what it is! Can't beat it!
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|Super bright perfect fit
B001NAQSNO|4|Fitment was a little off with the stock airbox. Had to bend it slightly but once I got the cover on it sits flush.
B002ZTGNBY|5|Easy install of OE part. Just have to drill the odd rivet out that holds the old unit in and replace it with a bolt.
B003AKN8UG|5|Fairly easy to install with the provided instructions.  Looks Great.
B00RJX16WM|5|Works perfectly and just as described. Main product picture is pretty accurate. Perfect for any ride-share Uber/Lyft drivers looking to get those perfect 5-star ratings. Have heard nothing but great things from friends and passengers alike.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Keeps items cool<br />- Outside pouches have good elastic grip on bottles/packs.<br />- Love that Kleenex box extension is optional and hides behind pack if unwanted.<br />- Fits up to 8 mini-bottles (6 inside, 2 outside)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Comes super compact and folded, so it takes a good while to de-wrinkle and begin to take shape, so keep in mind.<br />- Not sure how the bottom string-thingies help much. Add only minimal stability to the pack, unless it's empty, but then again why would you use if empty?
B0081SC1Z0|5|It is great to be able to put window up when it is cold and nice to have half window in the warm weather.  The company was super to work with us.
B0037DD3RO|5|I bought this set about 3 years ago and have put thousands of miles in with this stove. I'm a minimalist and this pot set has performed perfectly. Other backpacking buddies use snowpeak, and other titanium cooksets but don't have all the conviences this set offers. I don't use the phoon it's garbage. Some people argue that a jetboil is better. I like the weight savings I get with this pot. You can't simmer or do anything but boil water with a jetboil. My other complaint is all the parts on a jetboil can fail. Regardless of any break downs I can still use my pot. You can't stick a jetboil mug over an open flame if the stove breaks. I also have more options for fuel sources with this kit. Esbit, iso butane 4 season mix, propane, etc. Excellent product.
B001BFKW4M|3|The compass was easy to install.  The only thing that went wrong is East and West were reversed.  When I turned the sensor upside down from the directions, it worked properly.  I only wish the display was brighter.  I can read it without my sunglasses on but not with them on.  Otherwise we are happy with it.
B00318UXY6|3|That fan is indeed powerful.  However, the fan blade is terrible out of balance.  If the fan is mounted to heavy object, it is still noise but not objectionable.  However, in my particular use case, I intended to mount it travel trailer where the wall are made of thin material with little backing.  The out balanced fan blades are actually able to vibrate all near by wall panel which reverberate thru out he trailer cab.  Needless to say, this is not accept to use at night.
B001C6IVZC|5|My car is back on the road thanks to the affordability
B00EI6CKVE|5|Cute, I get a lot of laughs.
B005H7DRQA|5|I have always used ArmourAll because I have never know the difference. I talked to a guy in the actual car business (not a salesman) and he said Lexol is really the only option for leather... That man is correct
B001OMPJHM|5|Good
B00393V9GO|3|Like others have said, it's 5000K not 6000 as stated. Still brighter than what I had before so I'll live with it for now. Can't beat it for the price.
B008ADD3W6|4|Good product fits perfectly
B003ZLS77E|4|Great price.
B00IUVJYL2|5|Have 2 bmw 5 series just  fit to dashboard  out my self put them in perfect  save myself  3000.00 dollars  stars
B004YK3SME|2|Cord is to short to mount inside of local cabinet, connectors are for phone handset and no connectors are available. Had to cut solder and splice a section to reach from the charger to an inside location.
B001JT1IPM|3|Serves a purpose ~ No issues with this product
B008RO9DZE|1|This is an outrageous price for a simple plastic tube plug....
B0046ID5EK|3|Only works part of the time iv put a new battery in it and still only works part of the time will not order from this seller agen
B00RFH9JQM|3|No comment!
B00155237W|5|Not too dark but just dark enough, worried it would be illegal but i have been tailed by many cops and even pulled over and its just visible enough.
B0093O6ZQ2|1|I thought it was a great deal until I see de ridicously shipping price makes no sense at all
B001IGE6ZK|5|These come in handy.
B001M0IFKY|5|The best one I ever had for the price.

B00Q4AS1G0|5|If you need it for 3 series that's the right one.<br />I tried &#34;regulator fix&#34; before and their spring didn't work .
B00K325MC6|5|i used already twice a work perfect,i recomended.
B0055AW0N0|1|Holes too big for soda cans and will spill over on a sudden traffic light stop.
B0036GM3O6|1|picture shows front and back breaks the description doesn't tell you anything. they only send you one front break
B000C57KHE|4|Help my truck drives better.
B005JU5XE4|5|Though common autoparts stores nor Bosch list it, 19B and 26A do fit on the 2015 Outback. TireRack had it listed, and I tried it, and it works. Can't go wrong with the Bosch ICON.
B003WHBVDI|5|Great product!
B0023WCS0S|5|Nice looking side lights.  Better than OEM. Fit perfectly.
B00YC1SJR4|5|The lights housing is made of aluminum.  The light is sealed well.  It comes with about 4 inches of insulated wire (hot and ground) sticking out the back of the housing.  You can solder or crimp on connectors.  The guage of the wire is fairly heavy (maybe 12 guage) with good insulation.  I soldered on connectors and the wire took solder easily.<br />The housings fit inside my Auxiliary lights shells without any issue.  The light casing has the index tabs built into it so there is no turning and fitment is good.<br />The light is clear and bright.  While i haven't yet rode with them at night.  They do project a nice white light in a flat beam and go well with my LED projector headlight.
B00IP0A836|5|I love it!
B00651CLCS|5|I love the short and slick look of this antenna. I installed it very quickly and easily on my Jeep by myself. Good quality.
B001ILIQXI|5|Good product very similar product to dealer part. Highly recommended!

B00YHU8C6I|1|I own the federal trademark for this product and this is a violation. Please remove this product. Shannon Jones, I Used to Be Cool, LLC, www.iusedtobecool.com
B005CO9Y9W|5|Excellent valves need to order more.
B00L9CQH64|4|They are good for the price. Very easy to install. Included adapters if required.  Only downside is they appear quite a bit bigger in the picture than what you get.
B003IA9PNM|5|Great keychains, I've ordered these before and they last a very long time, plus as a RC helicopter flyer it suits my style.
B003AYTF1S|5|Factory fluid. The real stuff.
B00HJDI22E|4|great replacement bulb, much brighter than regular bulbs.  It will make your turn signal rapid blink.
B00NLMEVQI|5|Si good si far. Its fit.
B00O9W9J66|5|These belts fit 152211700 Craftsman grinder . You can tighten the one that goes to motor by adjust motor . the belt to wheel is not adjustable it will be LOOSE that is way it is , this is the belts . 2 belts needed .
B00RE6KV48|5|Seems to do a very good job. Non-toxic and no chemical smell, which is important for things like children's baseball gloves, etc.
B00J4TWA6U|5|Love your product everyone can't believe the price. Thanks
B00FRHOO9O|5|Better quality than I expected. Very easy to install.
B00NTNX7BO|2|REQUIRES DUAL FOCUS OF  REGULAR MIRROR AND THIS ONE. I COULD NOT GET USED TO THESE.
B0066TKKUY|5|worked perfect
B00T9GC18K|5|Yes very much. They are very well made lights. I would recommend them highly. Very bright also.
B00H9JZ84I|5|Have bought several sizes of these connectors. Always been happy with them. Glad someone offers these un-insulated. I can't find them locally...
B001YJ7YIM|5|Cheaper than most after market gas lids and it looks better too. I lost the gas cap to my vortex lid and the cap is not sold separately! You have to buy an entire lid! So I purchased this much cheaper unit and I find it much more astetically pleasing.
B000GZL29M|5|This has saved me on numerous occasions. I'm the genius that forgets the key in the bike and walks away only to return and find a dead battery. Word of advice on this charger: you may need to jump start bike battery with a car to get a little bit of juice then connect battery to charger. I made the mistake of trying to revive a completely dead battery with the charger.
B002MYW0DW|5|works great
B0074DFSO4|5|DIY'ed the replacement and saved hundreds. Very easy job. Be sure to remove air bubbles from the line or your warning light will stay on.
B001BDSUXE|5|As decribed .  Good quality...  Not sure why original one rusted out!?!  This is the exact replacement.
B000UK9DA8|5|Love it works great.
B00BITI5MM|5|Seems to be as good as any...
B00NBN1C78|5|I was really surprised by the weight of this jack when it arrived, the thing is built like a tank.  I mounted this on my boat trailer, it took about 20 minutes to get it installed.  The pieces all fit inside the metal box easily and it has a place for a padlock.  It really doesn't stand out on the trailer, so  I'm hoping it goes unnoticed by passerbys.  I tried out the jack on my trailer with the boat on it (it's a small boat) and it worked fine, as did the lug wrench.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this system, it's very inconvenient and should come standard on any trailer.
B00F1OUKYG|5|I love it!
B00A3UNYW8|4|Excellent tool but I need to its factions more
B00HLPSBL2|4|Fits 2013 JX35. Instructions are clear with good pictures. Mounting parts are labeled (ex: DF=Driver Front) to make it easier to identify. Had difficulty putting on 2 nuts. The bolt did not have a clean cut, so it was hard getting the threads to align properly. Take your time and slowly tighten; I think the nut rethreaded some parts of the bolt. All the other bolts and nuts went on easily by hand.
B001OXZ1IS|5|Just what I was looking for.  Great product.
B000C846VE|5|Its a gas cap...and it does a good job of holding in gad.
B00QMWQSAG|5|These were exactly what I was looking for. They are very strong the perfect size and color I wanted. They came on time and the packaging was also in great shape. I would definitely buy from them again.
B00BAZCRRS|5|So far they seem to be good
B001341K92|5|Very pretty, makes the car look complete
B00MVMMIA0|5|These work well in my 12v AC landscape lighting system. I used them to replace some 18w Philips bulbs that would burn out about once a year. A couple things to note: When used in an AC lighting system, there is a small amount of 60hz flicker if you look directly at the bulb. This may not be visible depending on the fixture. Also, as noted in the product description, these are over 1&#34; long (T10). The Philips bulbs are T5. I used them in a coach light fixture, so the extra length was not a problem, but you can see the bottom of the bulb now. With T5s, the bulb was completely recessed. The Philips incandescent bulbs output about 140 lumens - these are about double, but use 1/3 the electricity. Color temp is very close to 2700K incandescent.
B004C67GIM|5|I found that I had a re-usable filter in my 4Runner, but it was almost unusable. This filter is now in place and the A/C does a MUCH better job. The re-usable is in reserve for next year.
B00EA2VLE8|4|Animal print is so me, so this was a no brainer. The blue with black stripes looks really good on my blue car, plus it made it easier to spot in a crowded parking lot. Great for the animal lover or hunter. Only wish it was made of metal, hence the four stars.
B00P9EJGR0|5|Love them! I just bought a 2015 Jeep Cherokee. I have two small grandchildren. See where I'm going with this?! Lol. The fit is perfect. I highly recommend these seat protectors. Happy Nana! Thank you!
B00RW7EVKO|5|Simple to install.  Easy to fill tires on my dually truck.  So far, no sign of any leaking.
B011Q18D14|5|Love this product! Let me first say obviously I am a female and guys love to try and take advantage of women. Now with this tool I have I can check my own service engine light at my own convenience  and not have to worry about others lying to me I love it definitely worth the price as well
B002BI2RUK|5|Great
B000EQJUEM|5|Quality brakes. Good performance.
