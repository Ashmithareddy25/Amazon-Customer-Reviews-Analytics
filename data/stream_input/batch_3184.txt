0439023521|5.0|In a adventure filled, action packed thriller, The Hunger Games is a “must read.” In a setting once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, this Capitol is over the 12 districts and have control over them. Due to a lost rebellion by the districts the Capitol forces one boy and one girl from each district to fight till the death in the annual Hunger Games.

Driven by fear, hope, and love, Katniss a 16-year-old girl from the poorest district of Panem, which is known for mining, volunteers in place of her little sister and fight in her place. Along with her Peeta, the son of a town baker who is picked to lose first, are both selected to fight till the death.

Fighting for all that is worth, alliances or not history is made and the fight is over, leaving a twist on the rules, and a sudden turn in the story. Suspenseful, nail biting, and unpredictable makes this book a “must read.”
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Interesting. Able to sit through all without having to get up. Some of the scenes brought tears to my eyes. Would recommend. No indecent added scenes. This is hard to find in todays flicks. Very refreshing. Found this along with other great movies using Amazon Instant Video. Thanks Amazon for having good watching like this one.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|Secret Daughter<br />Can't rate it yet, It's asking me to rate the novel when I'm only 65 o/o through. I love it so far but would like to be able to finish it. What's going on?
B00G32OER4|5.0|Wow!~! Good filming. Kept me on the edge of my seat whole time. Screamed during some scenes. What makes this even scarier -it's based on a true event. Worth watching if you like the scary can be found on Amazon .com
B0058VW36U|1.0|For a paid version there should be no adds. This one is full of adds. Do not waste your money on this, just get a free one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining.  Keeps the mind and eye coordination very active.  Improves your sense of timing since your have to beat the timer.  Just great fun.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Stryper's &#34;No More Hell To Pay&#34; is a fabulous record.  My to favorite songs are &#34;Saved By Love&#34; and the song Michael wrote 20 plus years ago, &#34;Marching Into Battle&#34;  I would have to say that I don't care for the cover they did of &#34;Jesus is just alright&#34;. Seems like they took a strong record and made it weak. I am looking forward to hearing the recording they did at their sold out show at  Whiskey A Go Go in November. Great work Michael,Tim, OZ and Robert. Can't wait for the next record. Go Stryper.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has been wonderful.  Granted, you have to play around with it to understand it, but once you do, it's great.  If you watch online content, this is for you.  Primarily used with Netflix and YouTube, you can see regular websites as well with its casting feature.  However, the speed of the video might take a hit.  If casting from a desktop, you should get better results.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|To say it all in a short summary...The wait is over.  Carcass has delivered what may be the best recording of 2013.  This little nugget will tear out your eardrums and make you beg for more.  If you are or were a fan of Carcass, you owe it to yourself to pick this up or download the MP3.  You will not be disappointed.  Actually this album may make you forget that Swansong existed.  This is the album Carcass fans have been waiting a long, long time for.  2 big thumbs up.  The end of the year is almost here and I'm warning you that Surgical Steel will top many, many best of 2013 lists when it's all said and done.  Highly recommended for your listening pleasure.
0385504225|5.0|This book is for my wife and it came really quick.  Plus, it was brand new and the price was very good.
B00DCRE83S|4.0|Newsted full length debut follows up his E.P. nicely.  His style is certainly welcomed in this time of good metal music being released.  His vocals are spot on and there are hints of his Flotsam and Jetsam roots bringing out some speeding riffs and yelling vocals.  Overall a great effort from a legendary musician whose history in metal have been timelessly branded through his time with Metallica.  Not a true 5 star effort but a strong 4.5 stars in my opinion.  This album will take a few listens to even start to understand to depth of this slab of metal.  Should you buy it?  If you have a taste for thrash, progressive or even classic metal, this recording should be up your alley. Recommended!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|I like the fact that it doesn't aim like most bubble games.  I love bubble games but usually get bored pretty quickly.  With this game the aiming is different so my attention is caught a little longer.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|To start this off I must say this is the Stryper album that I have been waiting years and years for.  I have been anxiously anticipating the release of this album ever since I first heard an interview with Michael Sweet on the Focus on Metal podcast.  Little did I know that this album WILL be considered the greatest Christian-Metal release of all time.  The riffs are here, the solos are here.  There are catchy vocal lines and the music is very memorable.  If you ever gave Stryper a chance and gave up, buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed in any way.  This is the Stryper album I always wanted.  I will say thank you to Michael Sweet and his dedication to the music to finally release an album that is this incredible.  No More Hell To Pay is very worthy of 2 huge thumbs up and Highly recommended!
B004GYY714|5.0|Tune in Radio has WGN 720 from Chicago, and now i can listen to the Chicago news & sporst in Florida on my Kindle fire. JJ/77
B009R659L8|3.0|Great surprise ending! The book was a little slow in the middle, but towards the end, I couldn't put it down.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|at first it's fun for a while then it sucks it cheats almost more than any game I played you do what it tells you and when u do it it says game over try again.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this after seeing a poster for the Motion Picture that was coming out. While I found that it had a little bit of the Twilight series' elements I was still impressed with the plot. I was able to connect with several of the characters and couldn't wait to see where the series would lead. The sister/brother situation was alittle creepy but I understand that there had to be something keeping the star struck lovers from being together (not sure if this was the best option though).
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I have already pre-ordered the next book in this series, I can hardly contain my excitement. I believe the new ibook comes out in May. Read all of them, you will get caught up in the characters.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This is the sequel to City of Bones and it is pretty good. Glad the Cassandra Clare gave us more of these characters to see how they grew. This book contains more action and dives deeper into each of the characters lives. Not as good as part one but still worth the read.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|If you haven't watched &#34;Bullitt&#34; you must watch it for what is probably the greatest car chase ever filmed, done of course without any ridiculous computer generated effects. McQueen in his 390 Mustang chases syndicate bad guys in a 383 (not a 440 as claimed on Wikipedia) Dodge Charger around the hills of San Francisco, and as the cars go airborne and then bottom out the in-car cameras make you feel like you're in the riding in the cars yourself. The action starts around the 1:02 mark.<br /><br />&#34;Bullitt&#34; was a McQueen project from start to finish, although he did little of the actual driving in the chase scene (although he was a capable driver). His insistence on filming it on location caused his studio to back out due to cost fears so he produced it independently; it was the fifth highest grossing film of 1968.<br /><br />&#34;Bullitt&#34; is worth watching for more than the car chase however, and features solid supporting performances from Robert Duvall, Robert Vaughn and Simon Oakland.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This third installment to the series is the best since the first book. If one were judging purely on action it would be rated the best. Many questions are answered and finally Clary and Jace get to learn the truth about their relationship. I love that this series includes many different types of personalities and lifestyles. I was impressed by this latest book and think that it was well done. I kept seeing this as a motion picture as I read each and every page - would be great graphics!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|best Monsters movie. Funny, good story, and although set in a University- it remains age-appropriate for younger viewers. Highly recommended.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|It was so sad to see Alex's journey ended but it ended in a beautiful way. I loved this series from the beginning and to see it end makes my heart break but I'm so glad it ended the way it did. Seth redeeming himself, Aiden's love for Alex. Alex's strength and bad ass attitude when it was time to show what's she's really made out of. I love it!&#60;3
B00915G6MG|5.0|What can I say?  I am a major fan and have all of the NCIS seasons.  Looking forward to #11 coming out.
B00BL9860K|4.0|Baldacci, always writes great books,this one was also very readable.I love the play between King and Maxwell.I also liked the plot. I always look on Amazon for his latest book,as I have read all of his.
159514188X|5.0|I was told about this book. It was so good i couldn't put it down. It was read in a few days.. Now my grandma is reading it.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|My wife loves this movie so I purchased it as a Christmas gift. She was very pleased to say the least.
1589946901|5.0|I played this at a friend's house for the first time and immediately purchased a copy of my own. It's a really casual card game that can be played really quickly: under an hour if you know the rules. The rules themselves are quite simple and many of the cards are hilarious. I've yet to play enough games to get a deep sense of the balance between the races/teams, but each game I've played has been a blast!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|Clever, has action, emotion, and a surprise ending.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It may even make you jump up every once in a while.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I can no longer connect to facebook with my kindle on candy crush so it will not update to move on to new levels.
B004HYDL1K|4.0|It's action packed and fun, with a message.  It's nice to see Danny Trejo with the lead in a movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is fun , funny ,and ideal for kids I love it myself it's like temple run except with minions
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Same scenes level after level.  Same games over and over.  Some different types of games and different background scenes would make this game more interesting.
B008Y212PI|3.0|It is a fun game. I enjoy playing but they make you do a review to get the full content.
B00EKTCQCC|1.0|Hardly gives you any human anatomy information! You have to pay about $30 or more for the entire human anatomy app. Very misleading! Don't wast your time downloading this free app, isn't worth the time, and doesn't offer all of the info it says
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have had this for 1 week. It does what it says it will. I have it on 2 devices now. Recommended.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|The actors are good ones, so there is that. However most of the scare tactics have been used so many times in other movies (Insidious, for example) that it didn't really add much for me. The atmosphere and setting are great - it lost interest for me once the possession factor got added in. From there I felt it just fell apart.
0385340990|5.0|A fun and fascinating read. I learned so much about this island and it' WW II<br />Experience, great characters and humor. I laughed out loud.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Being from Vharlotte, where this was filmed, I was curious about the film. Then there was lots of hype about it. So I watched and really enjoyed this movie and look forward to its sequel.  I only wish I knew how to play these videos through my big screen TV!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this after deciding I needed a change from the Cormac McCarthy binge I was on. I'm glad I did. I had read about Wool in the WSJ when the book first came out, but was too busy to start reading it.<br /><br />Although this is a technically a sci-fi book, you don't have to be into sci-fi to enjoy it. I found it be great story that really draws you in as you follow the main characters and what happens to them. It is well a written book and leaves you wanting to read the the next book in the series as soon as you are finished.
038536315X|5.0|Fabulous flow of the plot interwoven with character development. From the beginning to the end, a fantastic story unfolds with perhaps a sense of reality aimed at our society.
B00F0N7JUG|4.0|Movie was great and came in all formats. The collectors edition packaging is a little cheesy, but still cooler than the regular case.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie in Bond tradition. I always love the action adventure that only James Bond can deliver. I love the ability to view such a great movie at home.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Loved the acting and cinematography. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars b'se I don't like it when parts of the story are changed in the movie. Book is still three times as good. Main story line is, however, unaltered .
B005USZYDU|2.0|This must be a kids book.  I mistakenly purchased it thinking it would not be so juvenile.  Oh well-live and learn.
B009O2XY12|5.0|A very nice game.  Anyone would love this.  Even youngsters would like this one The Graphics are great.  Lots of fun, keeps you on your toes.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|If you like sci-fi and fantasy then this one's for u!!!!  nine eight seven six five four three two one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just a fun game.  Love it. The Graphics are good also.  All ages will love this game..  Graphics are good.<br />Thanks.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Wonderful music.  Always enjoy listening to this group.  I love my children being able to hear people who can actually sing well instead of someone who sounds good because of autotune.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Wish the energy would reload faster. I love playing these kinds of games. This will keep me entertained for a while.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|This is a silly, crude movie that is a waste of the acting talent of everyone involved.  Not funny, either.  Don't spend your money on this.
B003VQQG8K|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!! For me not being a big reader that means a lot!! Definitely well worth your time!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|There were things that I liked about this book and things I disliked. I would actually give it a 2.5 rating out of a 5 star rating scale if I could. This is the third and final book in the Divergent trilogy. It explains some things and shows what the rest of the country was like, but it still ignores the rest of the entire world. We finally find out what is going on, but it is rather bizarre and totally unrealistic. Good fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian fiction has a world that is believable in it's own setting and this one is not. I did not like the ending. At all.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of my new fav, TV shows, I wont pay for cable buy for 7.96 a month I can watch the show and I still dont have to order cable for crazy $$ per month
B005K17RU0|2.0|It hardly ever updates wwhat the weather is for the hour. it will be 9 and the app will be showing me the weather for the day before.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love how easy it is to use this app. U can clean files and folders delete unwanted apps. Just hit the button and your done.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I think that kids who like neon will love this game. I think that everyone will love this game. So have a great time
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|The product is amazing!  First, if you put in that much detail in packaging, then I feel absolutely comfortable the product that you sell.  I have used the item and never had any issue.  Thank you for making a great product.
B005LAII0I|5.0|i have always wanted this movie and i didn't have to pay anything for it, and julia roberts is a great actress.
B000W0YWRK|4.0|Edgy music.  Obviously, favorite song on here is Happy When it Rains.  Very well written lyrics with an edge.  A different sound from more traditional music.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really am enjoying this game so far. Can't wait to see how far I can get my fairy farm to grow.
B002LFAHBO|4.0|Nice little holiday &#34;feel-good movie. Performances by some of my favorites: Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant. Good Music, fun movie. Highly recommend
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|First King novel I have read, and it's about what one might expect - interesting plot; so-so writing.  King has a lively and interesting imagination that informs the plot, but his writing is labored - no sensory experience is left unexpressed, as if he suspects that his average reader is, well, average...or less; thus he feels it necessary to describe every smell, every sight from every angle.<br /><br />As from &#34;Amadeus&#34;: Too many notes, Mozart.<br /><br />I prefer writers who hone their metaphors, and leave matters to our imaginations.<br /><br />Do you suppose he's writing for the movies?  Gee, I wonder...
0385351399|4.0|David Eggers is one of America’s most impressive and most daring novelists.  His work has won major awards, although perhaps the two most prestigious, the Pulitzer and the National Book Award, have eluded him thus far.  He is, however, still young, having just turned 40 this year.  Perhaps The Circle, his latest novel, may do the trick.<br /><br />This is a disturbing book, all about the power of computing science to create methods of social control.  Frankly, The Circle is a close approximation of the largest internet search engines, with all of their massive capabilities designed to know as much as possible of its vast body of users.  The Circle takes present-day searching many steps further; The Circle looks into every nook and cranny of the lives of virtually every individual, leaving nothing secret, eliminating all dissident opinions, crushing individual differences, and recording human behavior on a real-time, pervasive basis.<br /><br />Eggers introduces us to Mae Holland, freshly out of an elite Midwestern college, technologically untrained but very eager to learn and to please.  Her college roommate, Annie, is already well up the ladder at The Circle and in a position to guide the early stages of Mae’s career.  Eggers gets right to work and a sense of danger begins to color the plot.  The Circle is enormously powerful but becomes geometrically more powerful as the story unfolds. Only at the end do the voices of protest and dissent become evident.<br /><br />This is a story of powerful forces that frankly exist in our society today.  And that is what makes The Circle both convincingly possible and very threatening.  Eggers does a superb job in creating a sense of unregulated power in this book.  In a sense, it is a very well crafted work of science fiction but it is more than this since it is based on science that, in large part, exists today.  So Eggers’ work should be taken as a warning flare: the possibility of social control, or at least social conditioning, is drawn to full scale here.  And it is scary.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Theatrical versions of the original Star Wars trilogy.  Some of the most favorite memories from my childhood are going to the drive-in theater with my dad and my best friend to watch these movies.  Han Shot First!  Because he's not stupid enough to let a bounty hunter get the first shot off...
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|We used this app once ... only once. We were traveling and wanted to find out if we were likely to drive though snow or not. #1: we were NOT able to get that info. #2: we couldn't use it without it GPS stalking us. #3 since then we haven't been able to see the temperature at HOME! ALL that GPS stalking and now it still only tells us the temperature in the three places we looked up before. I would give it zero stars if it would let me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is really great, why does Amazon sell it but does not provide instant video on it? It's OK to make money selling the competitors product and screw your own prime customers......
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Strong story ,keeps you watching the drama as it unfolds. We wtched intently and folowed the story to te end.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Well acted, wonderfully well-cast movie about a group of British retirees on vacation in India...and their delightful young host, played by Dev Patel,  who promised way more than he could deliver, but does everything he can think of to make up for it.<br /><br /> You may well find this even more of a treat when watching it as a double-feature with Dustin Hoffman's first-rate directing debut,  \\"Quartet,\\"  about a home for retired British musicians, with all of the supporting roles played by actual retired musicians.<br /><br />Plus, Maggie Smith is in both of them.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I returned this product because I have a lot of slides to scan and it will take way too long with this device.  And, the viewing screen is so small you can't really see much and have to actually scan it into the computer in order to see what you have.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I have been waiting for this for a long time. What a great price for 10 CDs ! I like those rare gems that didn't get as much radio play such as &#34;Arrested for Driving While Blind&#34; and &#34;Dust My Broom&#34;
B0037NVM1I|4.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie.The special effects were done quite well, considering how old this movie is.<br />It's worth watching.
0312263120|3.0|I found this book somewhat difficult to get through and not very memorable.  On it's own, it's an okay story but compared to Brown's other books &#34;Digital Fortress&#34;  is a weak effort.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|No track disappoints.  Graceless, Don't swallow the cap, and Hard to Find are just some of the tracks that make this album great.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this so many years ago, but wanted to read it again before I got the new book. It was just as good as I remembered. Better, even.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Amazing book, it reinvigorated my spiritual practice.  I would suggest this as a gift to any person who struggles with faith (faith in anything really; faith doesn't have to be about religion!).  We all struggle with wanting clear evidence of that which we believe (or doubt).  This book is tremendously comforting for anyone in a particularly doubtful/fearful time of their life, or those dealing with loss.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I loved it! It refers back to the orginal tv series as well as past movies. A lot of action but not a lot of blood and guts. It was great!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Old school metal.. Cross btwn Metallica and LoG.. Been listening to it since i got it.. Awesome speeding music.. Raw..
B002K0WBXW|5.0|What a great combination.  The movie is pretty simple but getting a look at two hot stars nude is worth the price of the movie.
B00314VYNE|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old. I think she will really love it, Toy Story is one of her favorite movies. The doll was new in box as described and nice wrapped. I will order from again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found this one difficult to follow.  After his first two amazing books, this one falls short of my expectations.  KITE RUNNER is a classic so I was hoping for a similar story.  UMMM not so much.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Love these puzzles. So many to choose from, it's never ending fun that lasts forever. I find myself completing puzzle after puzzle and not even realizing how long I've been doing it.
B003B02O0A|3.0|Though I enjoyed the majority of the book, the ending left me wanting. The movie rectified this and though it is rarely said, the movie was much better.<br /><br />Here is my issue, the main character does nothing to sway the jury and win the case. All the time I spent pulling for the guy and someone else comes through. It is disappointing.<br /><br />Also... &#34;ro-ark&#34; got tedious to read. After explaining how he pronounced her name once was more than enough and detracted from the story.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Loved DS9 in the 90's and enjoyed the trip down memory lane when I was a huge fan of the series. Nice to know I can see it on amazon whenever I want. Enjoyed it alot.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I can't believe this. I'm crying. I need another book. This book was amazing and i loved the whole series. Please, Stephenie write another book, please? I'm crying because now there isn't another book. I need another book, what happens to Nessie and Jacob? And Edward and Bella? Us there any more adventures? They said that they would come back for them, what does Edward and Bella do? IDK SO MAKE ANOTHER BOOK PLEASE BC IM CRYING PLEASE😭
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a good game but every thing takes to long some times whole days to finish a resource. But other than that it's a really fun game my daughter likes the game a lot too.
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|Great CPU for a internet only type pc build. Internal gpu great for all basic needs and HD video playback.  Very nice cpu.  Upgraded from a AM3 635 quad core to this.  Extremely noticeable difference
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game. When I got it, I was amazed. You would like it too if you get this!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Works AWESOME, I own 2 with no problems or regrets, one for me and one for my gf!!  Love the LCD display and all the program buttons.....it is bigger then some of the other companys, but works great for me and my gf
B003O86FMW|4.0|One of my all time favorite books!!  the ending made me want to immediately buy Mockingjay and find out what happens between Katniss and Peeta. I think Suzanne Collins did a good job on describing the arena and Katniss's suit, especially the part about the dome. But just a warning, theres were some typos in the book.
B00GII9UCW|4.0|These two sound amazing together. This is not my normal style, but I love Norah's voice and am a Green Day fan and can't deny that these two are really good together.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|Brahms should have lived long enough to hear this. Nobody plays it better. No crowding: this is on two discs.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|ADDICTIVE!!! Thought I'd start playing for a few minutes before bed &amp; next I knew it was 3am....super fun game.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Loved the whole series. Breaking Bad is probably the best series ever. It gives you comedy along with very serious drama. Your money will not be wasted purchasing this and you will want to see the 5th and final season after you watch this one.  Blockbuster series. It definitely has its violence, but you can turn your head (like me) if it bothers you. Despite the violence I would definitely recommend this season and all of the seasons actually.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This might be more of a political review rather then a movie review so I apologize for that.<br /><br />Movie Review: The movie was drawn out and boring. It just enables the whole 'Murica mentality. Every 15 minutes seemed to have a bombing which would wake up the audience. It just seems like another propaganda movie. Since all of the information about the events are classified, who knows if the actual events of the movie are true.<br /><br />Political Reivew: We got Bin Ladin. Now get out of the Middle East. Every person we kill with a drone strike gets the terrorist 10 more recruits. Just because they are a 3rd world country doesn't mean their lives are less valuable then Americans. If China or Russia brought their army to American soil to search for a terrorist and killed innocent Americans while doing it, how would you feel?
B001DJLCRC|5.0|You will not be able to stop with this season.  I had to buy the rest after this one. This is probably the best television series I have ever seen (and I've been watching tv for many decades!).
B00B9PIWT6|5.0|Great looking boots. I get a lot of compliments with these boots. They are fashionable and go well with any boot cut jean I wear (Levis 527). I have a pair of Timberland Boots that I have worn for 10 years which are still good. These are just a bit more modern. The material of these seem a bit more thin compared to my old ones.  Maybe it's the recycled material that it is made from. Hopefully these will last as long as my old ones do.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|You have to watch the previous 2 seasons before you purchase this one. It's excellent. The actors Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are unbelievable in their performances.  You can see how Bryan Cranston's character, Walter White, evolves. This will keep you glued to your seat and wanting more when it's over.
B007WFR1TE|4.0|Great album but mechanize is better, the only thing that i do not like is that in they used drum machine but if you like ff you will love this album
B0016GOM5Q|5.0|I'd have to flip a coin to say whether &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; or &#34;Tombstone&#34; is my favorite western movie. I think I'll just call it a tie. This is one CLASSY western. Best version of the gunfight at the OK Corral that I think I've ever seen. This is my favorite role for Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. He practically steals the show.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|This book is a work of fiction,yes but a great collection.  Great characters. A must read.  Try it you will like it!
B002J8LVO0|5.0|I owned this album when it first came out in the 80s on a cassette tape. I hadn't listened to it for a while, then discovered a box of cassettes. I'm replacing them with CDs, got this album and listened. Wow. It still holds its own against today's music. It's unique, keeps your interest, and is so musically well-done. I'm not a huge U2 fan, but I continue to enjoy repeat listening of this one.
B004YXE438|5.0|I have enjoyed the puzzles in this app, the size and difficulties settings allows for many different age and ability groups to use. Have used this app with children and adults. Really like it. I am buying the expansion pack.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Okay, as hokey as it is, I'm a fan of the Farrow/Redford version of this story. But I'm a fan of the story most of all. So when this new version came out (didn't see it in theaters), I took a leap and hoped I'd like this just as much. I saw a lot of parallels in both films (as expected, since they're from the same book). I liked some elements from the older movie more than this one (period music vs. hip-hop of the new movie is no contest...this movie needed period music of the roaring 20s). I new this was a Baz production and expected it to be a bit \\"off\\", but overall, I enjoyed his take on the book. Casting was well done overall. DiCaprio did quite well as Gatsby, although \\"old sport\\" got OLD really quick (seemed forced at times).<br /><br />Note for Panasonic blu-ray player owners: this blu-ray will take FOREVER to load (actually about 3+ minutes before anything appears on screen). It's a known issue and there is no fix. The same disk played fine in my Playstation 3 and in a Sony blu-ray player.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun time waster. Highly addictive. I wish there were more trees to chop! I also like that you can x out selling options. I'm level 11 and still not able to upgrade storage:(
B003MOHX8S|4.0|Dramatically scored music! These guys are probably the best in the business at creating this stuff and they are quite prolific. The tracks are a bit too short for my taste. I like using some of it in my homemade family movies, but often times, my videos need longer excerpts. Still, you can't beat the quality.
B00GWEQOP8|3.0|WTF?? This series started out with survival and human effort to continue living in the face of an onslaught of inhuman walking things... hence \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br />Now we have the **Governor**!? I do not want to watch \\"The days of our undead lives\\" or \\"The bold and the beautiful Zombies\\".<br />This is slowly getting worse. The introduction of illness to the prison causing walkers was an acceptable twist, this soap opera crap is not.<br />Soon it will be Rick and the Governor skipping through fields, side by side, laughing and shooting anything that moves and sharing their emotions and delusions with each other, holding hands while the zombies start taking backstage popping up only when necessary to move the F'ing soap opera along.<br />AMC had a good thing going but it is going south of cheese slowly. Too much dRaMa... gets old... really fast.<br />Rename the darn show \\"The Walking alive main characters mentally struggling while killing\\"
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. I love  it and my two kids love it. They are always thinking of new updates to make  the game fun and interesting!
1582701709|5.0|Bought the book a second time to give to my daughter who requested it.  An interesting book, although getting what you want with their suggestions requires a lot of work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it.  Easy to learn, and lots of levels and different things to do, and it keeps them laughing and busy.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I am torn. I love all of Downey's movies. I love all Iron Man and don't forget about Sherlock Homes, but this one I think had<br />more of everything in it
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another wonderful Grisham. It is as fascinating to read as most of the Grisham books and intelligently written. I am a paralegal and since I enjoy my job, I find his legal stories great fun. He writes with a wonderful sense of humor and of history, as well. This novel provokes at times a sadness for the inhumanity of man, and unfortunately the reality was just that. I can't wait for another Grisham book and perhaps another movie!
B00FXMECS6|5.0|If you like the first one you will love this one. I like all Bruce Willis movies. You be the judge
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have probably played this everyday.I mean who would not like this game!? I have tricky frank Jamie tasha frizzy tagbot Lucy fresh and ninja.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I am completely hooked on this show. It is so loyal to the actual books. Well written, well acted, well directed.
B009UNH0EM|1.0|I have only had this for a few months, and it has developed an intermittent problem which has gotten progressively worse. At first, I was puzzled at the occasional lack of charging. My Plantronics earpiece normally charges to a full 7 hour charge in a very short time, even when very low on charge. But sometimes I'd have it charging on this for 30 minutes and check to find the time left was still as it was before charging. It has progressed to the point where it won't charge at all.<br /><br />I have cleaned the contacts with a swab and 99% isopropyl on both the charge cable and the earpiece. The earpiece continues to charge without issues on other charge cables. I tried this charge cable on different USB charge adapters. The problem stays with the charge cable.<br /><br />I've noticed in searching online that others have had problems with Plantronics charge cable, so I've ordered another after-market charge cable. It is working fine on the same USB charge adapter.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|This is a great CD. I absolutely love EWF!! They have really done it after all these years!! Yes yes
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have not read a better book that depicts a different way to live in the world. Grant it the book bogs down numerous times as Hugo goes on tangents that break the flow of the story. Do we really need over 2 chapters describing the Paris sewer system? But if you are looking for a story that contrasts law and grace and the redemptive power of love this is it. If you have watched the movie and are wondering if you should undertake such a large reading, you owe it to yourself to read it. Hugo's character development and the backstories of all the characters are brilliant and can only add to the enjoyment of the musical. You will NOT be disappointed.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Enjoyed the storyline a nd characters, especially Oberon. Not crazy about the setting. Lots of good guys and bad guys.
B00DE76PM8|3.0|My wife and I love to travel and the iOS [Apple] version of citymaps2go has served us well [it's a 5-star Apps]; however, Ulman needs to send their Android code-slingers back to the drawing board. <br /><br />Since 80% of the rest of the world use Android smart phones, we purchased an Android Samsung S4 for travel because it's cheaper to buy a SIMM card and month-to-month wireless plan in most countries than pay for 5 minutes of AT&T roaming charges. <br /><br />Anyway, the iOS version of citymaps2go paints the maps quickly [iPhone 4S], includes bookmark folders, and allows the user to save user pins to the bookmark folders, and add notes to the user pins. <br /><br />The Android version of citymaps2go paints the maps painfully slow [even with a much faster Samsung quad-core, Snapdragon processor], does not include user-defined bookmark folders, and user-defined pins cannot be added as bookmarks. And the millions of pre-defined pins [points of interests] often have generic names which make finding a specific POI in the user bookmarks list a guessing game; e.g., is the &#34;Walmarts&#34; in my bookmarks list in Farebanks, AK or Miami, FL?
B00BU18U82|1.0|I hats this game because its not like the Pc virgin I like the Pc virgin. But I hate this one.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|For the past 6 months I have used Dropbox as my primary tool for storing photos and documents, and sharing them with friends and family; and I would rate it a 5-star application; however, recently, while off-line, when attempting to show some favorite photos to my parents, I could not access any favorites on my local devise [an iPad 2] without logging on to my on-line account. Since I was 30 miles from the nearest internet access point, logging on to my on-line account was not an option, and fortunately I discovered this limitation before traveling overseas - which my wife and I do frequently. I have no idea why I was blocked from accessing favorite photos stored on my local devise, but until the issue is resolved, Dropbox is no longer my primary storage tool.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad Amazon finally added this game to the kindle. It's very challenging.<br />Also connects you to your Facebook game if you played before it was added
B009MJU52I|5.0|Ordered this to use in a terrarium I'm making.  Perfect size for diorama setting in terrarium.  Adds a regal compliment to the plants.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A different type of book and written very different.  This is not the type of book I usually read but I found it very refreshing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game occupies my time and my 3 year old loves this game too. He loves imitating the noises at the start of the game
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game is addictive when you want to play a racing game! Also this game makes it look like you are driving a real car. 5 Stars :)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This story is a twisting, turning, ride. The connections between the characters made me feel like I knew them myself. Highly recommended, I was hooked immediately!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I'm a big fan of thrillers and the CIA exploits. This was pretty exciting and it got me hooked on the series.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|For those of us who were fortunate enough to have been there, this CD/DVD combination is a dream come true. And such a deal! I'm honestly amazed that with the amount of material we're getting in this package, the price is still under $20.00.<br />One thing that most people listening to the CD will not know is that Barbra had a bad cold. She went on anyway and sang right through it. BOY did she sing through it! The slight rasp in her voice is not due to a change in her voice, but rather to a nasty head cold that would have had other lesser artists canceling their shows.<br />Her choice of material for this concert is a dream come true. 9 songs never previously performed live combined with many classics. Duets with the young and talented Il Divo, Chris Botti, and her son, Jason Gould were woven seamlessly into this historic event. There was also an exceptional female violinist whose name escapes me. Her performances were sadly, left off the CD/DVD. Actually, as much as there is on the CD/DVD, there was even more at the live shows. Barbra's son, Jason Gould, has an exquisite voice. His solo rendition of &#34;This Masquerade&#34; is in the bonus material on the DVD but was left off the CD. At most of the other shows on this short tour, Barbra reprised her famous duet with Judy Garland by singing Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again with her half-sister Roslyn Kind. I would have loved to have seen this on the DVD, but it simply didn't happen where this was recorded… in Brooklyn.<br />To summarize, if you saw one of the shows, it's already a given that you will buy this. If you weren't able to see her live on this tour, this CD/DVD package is the next best thing. Recorded with exceptional quality, it is a great addition to anybody's Barbra collection. If you're not a collector, it will give you a feel of what those magical moments with Barbra are truly like… Perfect.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is lots of fun. Because it is so addictive maybe it is a good thing you need to wait to get free opportunities to continue playing.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I have facebook but I cannot add them as friends/neighbors. I really like the game except for the limited storage and how long it takes to get items...7 hours for a blueberry patch??
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was so engrossed in this book that I felt transported back to the 50's with Jake.  This book has it all love,loss and hope.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Addictive - keeps your levels completed marked for you so you can start where you left off.  Deducted one star because mine shuts down sometimes randomly.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's The Walking Dead! What's not to love?! Season 4 has more zombies than before and is just as good as the previous three seasons. I love this show! I can't wait for the spin-off!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham. Hard to put down...you just want to read one more page! I highly recommend!
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|I love this movie!! This movie is even better and more funny than the first. If you liked Red, you'll love Red 2!!
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Amazing. One of the best books I read this year. An amazingg adventure. Great writing. teaches you a lot about India and human nature. And it's a true story!! Sooooo looking forward for port two to come out
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Tedious, stream of conscious conversation about mundane tech savy inadequacies and how trying it is to be the mother of primary age children.
0061245097|5.0|I loved this book and Bones was perfect the entire time. The first book was a lot of explanatins from the past and I got bored, but this time was action from the first second and it made things more interesting to me. Cat is more sure of herself, and I think it’s because she needed to grow a little and get some distance from her mother. This new adventure is set four years after the end in Halfway to the Grave, so Cat had some time to adjust in her new vampire hunter life, plus she’s living alone and trying a new relationship. Her life is not perfect, because there’s no Bones, but I liked to see her grow and learn to live on herself.<br /><br />Cat is now working for the government and I was scared when they first appeared, but now I just hate her boss, especially after discovering all those things he kept from her. Bones demonstrate a lot of sentiment in this book and the end was such a surprise for me. I barely kept from crying. I think Cat and Bones make a cute couple, but needs to learn a little more about vampire rules before making another mistake soon.<br /><br />A good surprise for me in this book was Cat’s group, her men are loyal and fierce, plus we can really see they adore her, some of them more than that. But Bones made things perfect for me. Can’t wait to start the next book.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Truly an amazing album. I reccomend it for everyone. Every song is catchy or fun to listen to. There's deep aner personal songs and then there's songs you would hear at a club.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game I just started it but it's fun for kid's and young adults. my sister loves to play it to and she's 10 so it's good for everyone .have fun :)
0425166805|1.0|There have been occasions when I have scored a book poorly because of a lack of interest in the truth - volume and easy answers at the cost of credibility.  That is not the case here, Daniken clearly had made the effort to learn and understand.  On other and less regular occasions, it has been the writing itself that has been the issue.  Many scholars of the nineteenth century did not insist on the precision of research and language necessary to match modern standards.  This is Daniken's flaw.  While he throws out remarkable and frankly unexplainable bits of information he does not organize it in such a way that can be easily studied and judged.  He may have undeniable evidence of alien encounters in there somewhere, but if so it is lost in the flood of information he gives the reader.  If Daniken had learned to write in a scholarly manner he might have been proclaimed a genius, he might have been a pariah like Dr. Daniel Jackson of Stargate (a movie/t.v. show modeled on Daniken's theories), or he might have learned in the course of his studies that there were alternate and perfectly credible explanations for the evidence he presents.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Loved buying from this seller and it works great with my kindle. I was happy when I received it and I would buy more from this seller.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Hands down best series I have ever read!  Terrific details, characters who live and breathe on the page, and a storyline that you don't want to end
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|I don't know whether it's a good script or good story, but definitely great actors and it's just hilarious, from the beginning to the end! Really got my attention within the 1st two minutes! Not for family viewing though (language and some graphics)? -would be great without them.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|You have to pay at least three dollars to do the other half of the  process. And you can't even do much if you don't buy the other half. You could spend up to seven dollars just trying to finish and do a decent check up and not do just 50 percent. Don't buy this game if your short on money!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have lot's of fun playing against family and friends.  It can be frustrating at times, but when I pass a level before everyone else it's great!<br />Really enjoy playing candy crush.  Addictive!
B00E9E4EC8|2.0|A country album with a banjo and a violin. Great vocals from Alan Jackson. I'm glad I have the cd but I don't listen to it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|As much as I abhor hunting for real I must admit that the game is pretty fun.  Ive always been good at aiming at things.  My favorite school activity ever was archery.  I wish everyone would just play a game like this instead of killing defenseless animals.  Im almost embarassed  that I enjoyed this game being such a self-professed bleeding heart liberal but Im being honest.  Its a hell of a lot of fun to shoot at things.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|its fun I liked the movie a lot so I downloaded the game and have not been bored with it. would recommend to friends for sure
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This movie left me unstable and somewhat depressed for a while. This is not a movie to bring your family too. But a movie that can change how you feel, or perceive the world, is what makes it a great movie. Each of the characters all had their sad back story. Ellen Burstyn gets to be on television, and goes into diet pills. She gave one of the most heartfelt acting I've ever seen. Jered Leto plays Harry, her son, a heroin addict and dealer. Even Jennifer Connelly, playing Marlon, Harry's girlfriend, gave a convincing story of being a<br />*Slight spoiler alert stop reading here*<br />hooker just to get money for drugs. and Harry's friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) had a backstory, though not as nervewrecking as the others, of his mother. The movie sadly didn't get me too deep into it. (Specially since he was thinking about her right before sex?)<br />*Spoiler stops*<br />This movie is also known for its soundtrack. It's annoyingly epic overused soundtrack of all time. If you're here just to see where this infamous soundtrack originated from, leave, or get ready for the intense depiction of drug addition(s), nudity and graphic sex.
B0001I561E|2.0|This movie has to be taken out and replaced by part two.  I wanted to be able to play it all at once.<br />Most movies are on one disk which is so much easier when you're taking care of an infant.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|the first movie arrived and was defective that would only play half the movie, I returned it for another disk which plays fine there was no problems with the return policy.<br />thank you well done
B0064MGU98|5.0|Extremely intriguing and interesting.  I would recommend this series to anyone not already watching it.  Actually, it's #1, so I guess most people are already watching!
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Seems quite a good game. Would recommend. Not sure were it's going but will soon find out no doubt if my daughter lets me have a go.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|I installed it, then tried to start it on my Nexus 4 with KitKat, and all I got was a blank screen. I cleared cache, rebooted, reinstalled it, tried a bunch of stuff like that and the app absolutely refused to start.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how it tells you what to do and its fun also it's better than temple run awesome game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY they have candy crush saga!!!!! And it is better then ever, plus they have the feature of connecting your facebook profile to the game!!!!! Love this game
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great story! Martin really builds the characters and takes you through unexpected twists and turns. Not a predictable  ending. I hate that a few of my favorite characters didn't make it but I'm sure there's more to come.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|I think that this game is really fun to play. The first time I played the game I got to the15th level.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most games dont hold my attention for more than a few weeks but this game has been on my favorites list for the past 13 months! Attention grabbing and perplexing. Love this game!
030758836X|5.0|Could not put this book down. Was blistering, fierce, amazing, suspenseful; everything you want in a book. Loved it and kept it (rare for me as I don't read a book twice).
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Okay I loved loved LOVED the first two books. I mean I loved them so much I read them in 2 days and i could not wait to start Allegiant but it disappointed me beyond belief.<br /><br />SPOILER*** read at own risk<br /><br />I was completely happy with the way everything was going until about the last 70 pages. WHO THE HELL KILLS THE MAIN CHARACTER??!!!!! Seriously everyone reads books for happy endings I don't care if you know everything good is going to turn out or not. No one in this world wants to read something where you have the perfect ending and then when you finally get to the last book your whole vision is shattered. I have never been more pissed about a series.<br /><br />I never and I mean NEVER write bad reviews on books and I had to make sure everyone was warned about this. I guess I should have read all the reviews on all of the books before started the series. I've already recommended the series to a number of people and I'm definitely going to tell them it was a mistake and not to buy the books. Such a waste of time and money!!!
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Pretty good, strange movie though.  There is one part where turbo goes through a engine but they way they depict it isn't even close to true.  Besides that a snail that can go that fast makes for a odd movie but since I like odd movies I thought this to be fun.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I loved how they had different styles of the justice league me and my friends love I loved the game it was so much fun sincerely your friend streetninja0509
1401235425|5.0|Awesome reboot of a classic character.  This storyline was great so I got this as a gift for a friend for him to read.<br />He enjoyed it as well.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This game looks awesome. I love injustice on xbox. But, every time i try to download it. It just won't. Please fix this.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the mysterious aura of this game. Loved the characters...Good art, good story line, and interesting mystical fantasy game.<br />Loved the game.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|I am trying to apply minimalism to my life, this book is a good introduction and very useful but I foud some things very extreme and nonsense.. It tends to be boring at some points
B0086700CM|5.0|It is the most fun game there is a second one too but I like this one better and there aren't too many annoying ads so its just the best game ever
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|You have to regain a lot of coins and sell goods . But it's all worth it , I'm on level 13 it gets difficult but it's amazing .
B002QP145C|5.0|I'm a viet nam vet, and this is an authentic movie that hooked me.  I watched it when I got it, several weeks ago, and I'm still thinking about it from time to time.  Characters' got my attention, and held it.  Simple story of survival.  Very realistic, which means not for kids.  No holding back on the blood and such, but in realistic amounts.  Grenades and explosions were realistic (no balls of flame from grenades or HE).  Very impressive production values: for example, tanks appeared to be period tanks, weapons appeared to be from the correct time period.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very good game.. I truly enjoy this game... I get lost in time with this one so make sure you have a lot of time on your hands...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app.  The harder levels give your gray cells a real work out.  I find it hard to stop playing.  I look forward to more additions to this compelling app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game! I'm addicted! I must try some of the other games my sissy is playing. Now to beat my high score!
B006S01GH2|5.0|One of my fav. films! I watch Amelie to cheer me up on down days.. Definitely a classic! XD :P :D
039916409X|5.0|Margaret Lynch has an awesome style of communication....her ideas and techniques and teachings are clear and concise, easy to relate to and in the style only Margaret possesses!  Every step of the way is mapped out in this book....in clear directions and exercises.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is excited about EFT, learning EFT and excited to change their life on the inside as well as outside.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesomeness this is the best game ever. My daughter loves this and I am totally addicted. Keep up the good work and the updates.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Wow!  If this doesn't convince you to not break the law, I don't know what will.  I have not watched the TV series, but this book is really well done.  You will feel like you are living the life Piper lived.  Well done.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very user friendly! Helps find new radio stations similar to your current likes. Love it! Even got husband using it!
0141394811|5.0|Excellent narrative.  Witty, and always talented in the telling of even an ordinary experience.  I'm glad Morrissey chose to write and release this now and didn't wait to have it release post death.  The US edition will be released Dec 3rd.  An excellent xmas gift.<br /><br />He is very quick and concise in some areas and then let's go elsewhere.  The Smiths history doesn't have Morrissey rambling on lamenting the demise, he delivers and moves on.  Of course he is always seen in the light of goodness.  It would be nice to read that he admits he can be a bit of a t*at, something he's been called more than a few times, if only to see he has some sense of reality in regard to his own actions, e.g. the notorious reputation for canceling performances, sometimes with a weak reasoning when if we look at the track record he will cancel shows that haven't sold well.  Yes, he is ill at times, to be sure.<br /><br />Many wonder exactly what goes in that mind who wrote the lyrics that saved my/your life.  We finally get a glimpse into the enigmatic, earnest goings on.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Awesome read straight through in two sittings.  Only because I started late one night and just couldn't force myself awake any longer.  Love this kind of real world virtual reality stuff. And of course the riddles and scavenger hunt plot. Love love love it!!
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|His best album in years a must have for all Elton fans. The live tracks are a nice addition. You will<br />Want to play it over and over
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus Free works very well. User friendly. Everybody should get this app. Very convenient easy to use. One of the best.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Zusak's talent with words is unmatched.  He grips the reader with his simplicity and ability to uncover the human dignity of such graceful individuals.  I will never forget Liesel.
0143038419|5.0|I absolutely loved it. It changed my life. If you don't like it, don't keep reading it while complaining to online forums the whole time. By revealing her sometimes selfish behavior on her spiritual journey Gilbert gives the reader permission to put themselves first in the quest for happiness.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I didn't know how to play backgammon until I downloaded this game.  And now, I'm addicted, of course.<br /><br />The graphics are great, the menu options simple to understand, the gameplay is smooth.  Rarely nags for ads and keeps track of your wins.  I play this every day, love it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Too much heartache.....<br />Too many beloved characters tortured in various ways.....<br />But constantly on the edge of my seat....<br />Glad she shot Coin!!
B00GX598FO|4.0|If you enjoyed Red, you will LOVE this one.Way over the top action. Great characters, but mostly a real FUN movie.
B00FEQ3VFG|5.0|An excellent set of figures that actually portray source material accurately.<br /><br />My daughter loves the Elsa and Anna figures in particular, but they all hit the high marks as she lugs them around everywhere in the house.  :)<br /><br />I hope a version of the characters as children is also released.  A little Sven would be awesome.  :)
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|The graphics and storyline were good, but WAAAY too short for the amount of money. G5 needs to seriously reevaluate their game prices, because for $4.99, the game should last at least a few days, and I was able to complete it in a few hours.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Good for a while then too glichey( sticks, freezes ,slow, no pix, limited timeline feed, wont update posts,comments ,likes) at times , kind of useless. Will try again later.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A series that draws you in with upstairs/downstairs intrigue but delivers on every level from story to acting to setting.  Wonderful for the viewer when writing and casting come together so seamlessly--even the villains are a treat to watch.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Of the plethora of Christmas music that surfaces after Thanksgiving, Christmas In The Heart has found its way to the top. It does a perfect job in conveying those holiday sentiments I clung to as a child. Granted, Dylan is no Bing Crosby but the feeling is the same. For what it's worth, this album does get a few listens throughout the year. It's that good.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It's so funny because you are trying to keep the people from dying and it even has it's own song called dumb ways to die  like take of your helmet in outer space or use a shirt dryer as a hiding place .
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|Wife said it was a really good show, I don't remember much I'd give it 5 stars for putting me to sleep.  I'm kidding it was OK.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Truly love Andrea and this cd is as good as any others of his!  Buy it, you'll love it too
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is so cute. The story is heartwarming, and there was nothing inappropriate for my 6 year old. We loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device is awesome. It basically allows my TV to become an app device, controllable by my other app devices (iPhone, iPad, laptop, etc.). I wish there were more apps that worked with it, though. I mainly use it with Netflix, Pandora, and YouTube. I can &#34;cast&#34; google chrome web pages to the tv, but most embedded video on web pages (except for YouTube), like CNN video will not work with chromecast yet. Hopefully more app brands decide to support chromecast in the near future. If it could somehow by upgraded to stream my desktop to the TV in real time, like any HDMI cable connection, I'd probably give it 5 stars.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I lit my hand on fire once using the string, polish remover and lighter method to break bottles. This is a very good alternative for a klutz like me!

B000VUVG7U|5.0|One of my favorite pieces of literature is Beowulf.  This is one of the greatest visual tellings of this ancient legend.  The cast the crew did a marvelous on location shoot of the story.  As with all great stories, I fell into it and believed it,  Great! Just Great.
0753827662|1.0|Clever writing at times but characters in this story leave you feeling nauseous ,<br />nothing entertaining about any of this story except some writing, which<br />seems very contrived to many times. The only page turner aspect of this<br />story is you want them 'gone' as fast as possible.<br /> May be a best seller but I sure have read more<br />interesting and compelling stories. Don't waste your money.
B0055SWM08|5.0|AWESOM GAME!<br />Really worth it and I highly recomend!!<br />It is very addicting and and cery fun to play!<br />Quell... Best game ever
159463176X|5.0|Wow! I think I liked this even better than Kite Runner. The novel starts with a poor Afghan family and a heartbreaking choice made by the father and seemingly meanders into a variety of narratives by different characters who all turn out to be connected in one way or another. Hosseini does a masterful job at pulling out a character from one story and weaving it into another story and another until it circles back around and gives the reader closure. I highly recommend this one!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was just amazing, you can just learn so much from this story.  I loved it.<br />Best book I've ever read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It was not as good as i expected. Some times it is slow and also do not support web browsers.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book is truly beautiful.  Meaningful, deep, and a good plot line, I will definitely be purchasing a hard copy.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Needs no words, to be the best.<br />Just watch it....  You will watch<br />It over and over again..<br />Love is Great.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really did like this book. It held my interest, and I was excited to see what would happen next. HOWEVER, the ending killed the book for me. I don't even want to see the movie now knowing what the ending will be.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is beautifully written.  It engages the reader into the story.  This is an easy read.  You can sympathize with the characters in the book, and understand how their lives worked out living in the times that they did.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It has amazing graphics and storyline. Lots of areas to visit and tons of puzzles, mini games and HO scenes. Good hints if you need them.  Love to see more like this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is so funny and the ponis are so cute !! I love this game :) because if I don't have to do nothing, I can play this game if I was boring. I don't know to much English but I hope that you can understand me :) God bless you
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome I love the graphics and that you can climb buildings and I liked when the  door dropped and I used it like a surf board. I like the big city I like jumping off buildings and fighting bad guys.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I gave it five stars because it was genuinely suspenseful, and unlike many horror films, it had a satisfactory ending.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|Fascinating account of one of my heroes. So glad he can remember anything at all! Anyway, my own life's background music... what an account.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Excellent for USD 54, nice appearance and finishing. As automatic device the power could last longer. The watchband is unique, to buy replacement is desirable.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Too many typos have prevented me from fully enjoying it -but he's a great story-teller, and the world he describes is just so fascinating.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Seems like it quickly progresses to requiring large amounts of collected items to move forward in the game.  The graphics are really good however
B00CZF8B68|5.0|BEST SONG MADE. You will feel happy an optimistic about life after hearing it! Plus I absolutely love Pharrell Williams. Genius.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|Darling little fox figurine. We used it to decorate my toddler's birthday cake and he loves playing with it, pretending it is running on the furniture or eating things around the house. Well-made, sturdy, and a nice size for little hands to play with.
0992251656|5.0|Very true to the series, great for fans of Firefly, but is also a fantastic board game in its own right. High production quality, from the board, to the cards, right down to the little miniature ships. Very themeatic and captures the 'just keep flying' attitude of Firefly perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.
B008D36INE|5.0|This movie was very obscure and dark but that's what I loved about it. I've seen all the boy meets girl movies - they are predictable! This movie tugged at my heart and soul and was relatable to those who have been in a toxic relationship.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Great cast especially Helen Merrin.  Good script  with  Lots of action and no dull interludes.  The plot is silly but that was intended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book captivates you so you never want to put it down. It pulls on your emotions shock make you love each character in your own way.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|This Is classical Grisham... Back to the basics we enjoyed so much.<br />Glad he decided to visit Ford County again
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This is a very long book that follows Theo Decker from losing his mother in a terrorist bombing at a museum they were visiting. This was where he first laid eyes on a beautiful red-haired girl with her grandfather. When Theo awakes, dazed from the explosion, her grandfather beckons Theo, thinking he is someone else, gives him a ring and an address. He also points to a piece of canvas in the rubble, The Goldfinch, a rare painting that was a favorite of his mothers. He takes it, still dazed and looking for his mom. He can't find her so he heads home, following a plan they had made for emergencies. But she never shows as she didn't make it out alive. Theo goes to live with the family of a school friend, until his deadbeat dad arrives to take him to Las Vegas. There Theo becomes friends with another outcast, Boris, a well-traveled and far more experienced person than Theo. Then things change and Theo finds himself back in New York now living with Hobie, an antiques dealer, who lives at the address given to Theo by the man at the museum.<br />Throughout his travels, Theo keeps the painting close to him as it reminds him of his mother. But as the years pass, Theo realizes the painting is on a list of paintings that most likely survived the blast. He is now scared of getting in trouble and causing trouble for the people he knows.<br />For the most part I really enjoyed this novel, much more than The Little Friend. But it could have used some editing. The story is many things, a coming of age story, which can get a little tiring, especially during his time in Las Vegas. I liked Boris but a little of him went a long way, then he shows up again when Theo is in NY, engaged to be married and working with Hobie.<br />I also found it annoying how Theo hid the painting, afraid to get caught, instead of mailing it back anonymously.<br />This could easily had 200 pages cut from it, and the ending after the ending is just a long, rambling philosophical extra that should have been cut. I don't know how these almost great works get by a really good editor. It was worth the read but I'd never re-read itow these almost great works get by a really good editor. It was worth the read but I'd never re-read it
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|If you love Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, and would like to see him grow as a character and perhaps fall in love….this is the book for you.<br /><br />This novel is a romantic comedy--not a dramatic piece of literary fiction, but it is well-written and character driven.  This isn't a terribly serious portrayal of an individual with Asperger's, but it is a respectful and thoughtful portrayal.  It's also fun, engaging and thoroughly enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars: a touching book that make you feel like your emotions are being dragged out of your body. Beautifully written, a cup of cancer, tea spoon of star-crossed lovers, and 23/7 drunk writer will make you cry one second and laugh like a madman the next. It's like having your period. (I'm still talking to guys here, too!) Hazel's blunt humor and frankness is _____! I DONT EVEN HAVE A NAME FOR IT! I always highlight my favorite parts of books, including comebacks and etc, just to put it out there, I highlighted the whole thing! I love Gus, he is the whole package. I love him, and his best friend Isaac(funny pair.). I give no spoilers, so what I comment is what you deal with!:3 No regrets!
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Not my favorite Christina Aguilera album, but there's a lot of really good songs on here. Some of the lower, more sentimental songs took away from her more powerful songs, but that's just my opinion. Good album.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'll admit I was hesitant to purchase and read the final book in this trilogy but I am glad I did.<br /><br />Collins has beautifully concluded the series. It definitely didn't seem forced or awkward but more intuitively written, as if you could see the progression of Katniss from victim to an ordinary person.

B00319ECGU|5.0|Great collection, it's awesome it's on Blu-Ray. If you look at most of the other sellers that are cheaper it is an overseas version which believe it or not won't play in a lot of DVD/BLU-RAY player. This is the American Collectors set and I couldn't ask for a better price and shipping only took 4 days from CA to PA. Thanks!!!

B000IKHNT8|5.0|I'm so pleased to have this series now. I had to search long and hard to find the trilogy compilation that included the original theatrical releases (Han shot first, etc) and this one has it. Huzzah! The metal box is great also. The artwork on it is fabulous and it's quite durable. Super pleased. :D
B001ECDVKE|4.0|Mars Attacks! is an a parody of science fiction B movies, with elements of black comedy and political satire directed by Tim Burton. Based on the cult trading card series of the same name. The film was also inspired in part by a parody Howard Stern did in which Martians attack and the discovery that the only way to kill them was to play Slim Whitman songs.<br /><br />The decision to hire an A-list ensemble cast for Mars Attacks! parallels the strategy used for disaster films such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974). The film features Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Short, Natalie Portman, Rod Steiger, Michael J. Fox, and Christina Applegate.<br /><br />A sign of a great actor is when someone is unrecognizable (without the aid of makeup) purely based on how they act. Annette Bening transforms herself into an authentic portrayal of a new-age hippie. Professor Donald Kessler is portrayed by Pierce Brosnan. Glenn Close all but eats the scenery in an inspired scene-stealing portrayal of First Lady Marsha Dale.<br /><br />Continuing Burton's trend of recasting actors from his previous works, Jack Nicholson from Batman (1989) is President Dale, Danny DeVito from Batman Returns (1992), and Sarah Jessica Parker from Ed Wood (1994). Reporter Jason Stone is portrayed by Michael J. Fox.<br /><br />Mars Attacks! delivers on its satiric homages to 1950s science fiction B movies, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964). Mars Attacks! is all modern cynicism and disbelief, mocking the conventions that movies such as Independence Day took seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker is one of the films most disturbing \\"Body Snatchers\\" visuals.<br /><br />\\"Popularity-casting\\" aside Mars Attacks! delivers as an all-star sci-fi extravaganza.from Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Danny DeVito from Batman Returns (1992), continuing Burton's trend of recasting actors multiple times from his previous works. This is also notable for one of the few times that Johnny Depp turned down a role in a Burton film. He was originally approached to play reporter Jason Stone. Michael J. Fox was cast instead.<br /><br />Mars Attacks! homages to the 1950s science fiction B movie classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964). Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the conventions that Independence Day takes seriously. One may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's as a chihuahua.<br /><br />&#34;You have to admire everyone's chutzpah: the breadth of Burton's movie references, which range from Kurosawa to Kubrick; and above all their refusal to offer a single likable character. A thoroughly mean-spirited big-budget movie is always a rarity.&#34;<br /><br />Mars Attacks! &#34;a cult sci-fi comedy cast as an elaborate, all-star studio extravaganza.&#34;
0740748475|4.0|Purchased this as a gift and was not disappointed. Very nicely done. The panels are large and nicely printed, the pages glossy, the binding quite nice. Be warned - super heavy!
B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious is a bleek yet inspirational film unflinchingly capturing abuse and dysfunctional life, largely bolstered by exceptional performances from its cast. To merely call it harrowing or unsparing doesn’t quite do it justice. Compelling and uncompromising, a mixed bag of debasement and elation, despair and hope. The film is about improvement and self-actualization with a protagonist who is too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, Black, overweight single mother in the inner city.<br /><br />Without being familiar with the source material, one really has no idea how much work went into this adaptation or how well it was done. First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher did yeoman's work turning Sapphire's idiomatic graphic novel into a coherent story about the journey of an abused teen.<br /><br />A potent character study of a world we'd rather pretend does not exist, the film that doesn't shy away from the lower depths of human experience, going into the pathologies that may linger in the closets of some impoverished lives. It also shows the strength and resilience of which humans are capable, even at our lowest moments.<br /><br />Mo'Nique's performance is frighteningly convincing. Mo'Nique delivers a dynamic performance that incites anger, hate, pity, and then tears at the heart. Mariah Carey's authentically deglammed performance is surprising pitch perfect.<br /><br />Daniels cast name actors and was able to go beneath their surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right.<br /><br />Sidibe's debut film is a tribute to her ability to sustain empathy because she completely embodies the massive body of the inarticulate and emotionally shut down Precious character. The film's fantasy sequences show that Sidebe is indeed acting and that she is a joyous person completely different from Precious. Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who actually look. Her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. &#34;These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,&#34; she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance.<br /><br />Paula Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as compassionate.<br /><br />It's a moving experience, because by the end the viewer has witnessed the birth of a resilient soul. The final scene of revelation between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters is strong enough to be able to leave viewers filled with pity and terror.<br /><br />A rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, it is a shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely courageous story.story is that of a writer discovering a voice. &#34;These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,&#34; she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance.<br /><br />Paula Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as compassionate.<br /><br />It's a moving experience, because by the end the viewer has witnessed the birth of a resilient soul.

B00DZJ82TY|5.0|I agree with the DJ who said &#34;You won't find another album that starts out with five songs better than the first five here.&#34;  The alternate track version of &#34;Into the Mystic&#34; is a great choice for the &#34;Expanded&#34; 2nd CD, it has Van's vocal with guitar and not much else.  To me, it's as good as the &#34;polished&#34; arrangement on the original version.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Great movie! Very much &#34;worth the squeeze&#34;.I would recommend this movie to anybody who can handle a little adult humor.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I It is not ad free. The ads come up when you replays failed level. The ads are for o t her angry bird levels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow...I'm at a complete loss for words! This book had me captivated from start to finish. I could not put it down if I wanted to, and am now left even more intrigued to read book two in this insatiable trilogy.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|The suspense of where the hero went is kept during the entire novel.  The author has done an excellent job, as he has with the others in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Need I say more? Very relaxing game and I just cant get enough! Until I run out of lines,  that is. It's fun but,  I refuse to spend money or anything like that on a game.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another fine novel in the Heroes of Olympus series.  It does keep one riveted, as it is quite as hard to put down as the others in the series.

B0001I562I|4.0|A fun movie from some time ago, filled with twists and turns as the navigator flits back and forth in time, mostly unknown to him why with a good ending.
0553565915|5.0|I have ordered dozens of copies of this book and given them as gifts to people in need of this message. I love it so much that I have read it several times as it changes the way I live my life as it ultimately will impact my eternal life. I view this book as a must read, and used copies can be purchased for 1 penny plus shipping. The vendor was amazing as always, excellent representation of the quality of the copy and shipped as promised.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's value for money but it could be better. A kind of delay when you connect to your PC (chrome) (3-5 seconds).<br />Doesn't works with iPad 1 (chromecast app needs iOS 6+
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It worked for about an hour and then quit.  No matter what we tried it would no longer boot up.  Unfortunately, I waited a couple of months to install it and by the time i did and found it had a problem, it was too late to return it.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This movie is emotional and hilarious. That actors are wonderful and I really enjoyed the sweet story. It was interesting to see Aaron Eckhart in a movie where he wasn't the villain.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|It's the Mule, and with their best songs and arrangements in the last 5 or so albums.  Buy the bonus disc, also; the different arrangements and vocal approaches are a revelation.- Dr. John's cut reason enuff.
6302180163|5.0|The film is very good, as one would expect from Truffault. Jeanne Moreau is stunning and devastating in this classic femme fatale role. One small quibble regarding the VHS version: on our television, the subtitles are at times obscured and truncated. However, it isn't at all enough to ruin the viewing experience.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|The Energizer Bunny of rock-and-roll is back, but that ain't no battery-pack he's wearin'.<br /><br />*RIP* Ron, welcome back, James. The rhythm section's doing fine, mom, all sweaty like that, and the sax is sexy.  Right Mom? What? Dad keeled over? We'll have to dedicated no. 10 to him, so keep on dancin'. Or rolling around in the glass, yep.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|seems to be easy now but just wait until it gets further into the game. I played it before it gets complicated. keep going fun
B00BUNQOOM|4.0|Just plain good rawk, well-recorded, writ and played. I wish I was in this band, and I'm glad they're back.<br /><br />Cool Neil Young cover, and great album title, too.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|love the movie.  Hope there is another one in the future.  Enjoy all the characters and the sly comments between the characters
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|An amazing guitarist, a great write, an unique vocalist at his peak here. Get the second disc, which makes it a worthy double album.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Trash. Complete trash. Terrible writing. Awful grammar. The sex scenes are written with the maturity of a junior high kid. Over-rated piece of garbage.
B00979CS50|5.0|I hear this even when I haven't listened to it in like a month, man. I mean, like I'll be sitting there looking out without even any window pane, and I'll be like right in the middle of it.<br /><br />And it's *good* man. Like, it's really kinda long and the guitars wank all over and Neil's like *pissed*, man, and I feel sometimes it's at *me*, y'know?  And Crazy Horse is all that, man, and they could be playin' right here in my garage except somebody - probably that evil soccer mom across the street - would call the cops and they would come and bust us, man, and that wouldn't be good, and if we tried to keep 'em out they'd knock down the door and break all the window pane and *that* wouldn't be good.<br /><br />Y'know? You *know*.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|A sad, nice, book and worth the money because it was full of facts, and really gave me a picture of her real life. I really liked this book, but the end didn't seem like an end, of course because before she could write anything else the Nazi's took her away.....this sad story written by Anne really showed her personality. I wish I could have met Anne in real life. The story made me understand Anne  very well.
B000E5N62U|4.0|You either like this guy and his solo records, and his bands, or you don't. He tends towards the brainy, the obscure, the poetic, the complex and the exceedingly musical statement, with lots of irony, sarcasm and touches of bitterness and humor, and bitter humor. All of that is here, with some kind of weird concept in the title song ... and Ray Charles' ghost.<br /><br />Their notoriously stellar musicianship aside, his records are famous for their nearly always squeaky-clean production (the first SJ and the &#34;live&#34; records are exceptions). This is sonically beautiful.<br /><br />And yet, you can dance to it.<br /><br />For me, this is tied with *Kamakiriad*; I prefer *Sunken Condos* and *Nightfly*, in varying order
B008LXZFH6|1.0|It was pretty funny for 10 minutes or so, then we turned it off. Not much more to say than that.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|They keep calling it &#34;dad rock&#34; in the media - so what?  It does rock, in a kind of martini/stoned way, but don't let the apparent casualness fool you.  The songs are brilliant, the lyrics can be downright vicious, and the playing is wall-of-sound sharp, with Berninger's croon sounding a couple of tequila's away from mayhem and murder. Great band with yet another great album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book! Gripping! Lost sleep because I couldn't put it down. Thriller but frustrating at times depending on who you get attached to and where you want the storyline to go as the reader.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This film has everything, good script, great cinematography, superb acting, everything.  Can't wait 'til the next part opens on December 13.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just plain old fashioned fun!!  Great for down time or, as in my case, an escape from 6 hours of a movie that my girls are enjoying.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Great DVD has good quality and sound. Their show in Vegas was really entertaining and has a lot of great close ups. All the best songs too.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|It's a semi-interesting film, depending on the ongoing popularity of Marilyn Monroe to sell it.  'Sort of like the many films about Jackie Kennedy and Princess Di.  This one is patterned after an alleged almost-romance with a young English fellow who worked on the set of the film she made with Lawrence Olivier.  I think the problem, other than the difficulty of finding anyone to do justice to Marilyn, is that the story is so thin.  It's about this Englishman who manages to get a job on the film set and then again manages to spend a little time with her.  It's more about him than about her but of course no one cares about him.  If they had had a real romance that might have been more of a story...but apparently this was little more than a school boy crush....a few encounters that he embellished greatly in his own imagination....wrote a book about it and now this film. You have to give him credit for parlay something very slight into a major motion picture.<br /><br />As others have said, Michelle Williams does a wonderful job in an impossible task....who could play such a person?  Michelle captures the vulnerability, innocence, and lost-child qualities of Marilyn beautifully.  What she lacks is the  sheer sexiness.  Her scenes where she is &#34;successful&#34; in the film, playing the naughty showgirl are not convincing, and almost embarrassing.  The fellow who plays Colin, the young star struck fellow, is good as the innocent caught up in first love.  Emma Roberts is noteworthy in a small role as the wardrobe girl (not the acting coach as the Amazon reviewer stated.).  Kenneth Branagh is one dimensional as a constantly annoyed Lawrence Olivier.  I had to wonder if the real Olivier was that mean.  Also suspect to me was the character of Paula Strasburg, who was portrayed as almost an evil enabler of Marilyn's unreliabiltiy.<br /><br />Since the story line is so flimsy and hard to beileve, the success of the film rests on the somewhat fragile shoulders of Michelle Williams to convince all the viewers that she is Marilyn.  It's a terribly difficult job and she does a heroic job, but that's not enough to make a  totally satisfying film.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Awesome set. The CD's and the DVD are great have really enjoyed them have listened and watched several times now.

B00D8HNR2K|2.0|so disappointed in this album, i guess i expected to much.  well, i expected NIN .... not a dance album for clubs... boo.<br />none of the songs made my phones memory card, where all the rest of NIN lay
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Excellent story written in a surprising way. People my age and older will remember these years. Younger people need to hear the story.
B00000DQSF|5.0|Just love the Band and like this album the best. Brings back many good thoughts and times. Know the world will never see another point in time as&#34;pure and unselfish as this time was!&#34;
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|This book seems like it might have  been written for a high school  composition class.  The story was predictable and the dialogue was stilted.  Could have been a page turner, but just wasn't.  Near the end when a good book keeps you  intrigued I put it aside to play a game on my phone.  Finished the next day.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoy the theme of this story. I enjoy  how you made it very dramatic and very emotional . I cried at least 2 times. I also like this story because  I never wanted to stop reading because it was so intense.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol is a classic novel put into a fun and enjoyable family movie that we watch every year along with other great Christmas time classics like &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; &#34;Home Alone&#34; &#34;Christmas Vacation&#34; etc.  Buy the movie and buy from this seller.  NIB, arrived almost instantly, great packaging.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|The quality was horrible! We had to pause and let the video load every five minutes. It wasn't our internet connection either because we streamed netflix without an issue.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I loved it when I watched it the first time with my oldest daughter 14 years ago, and it was just as thrilling watching it with my youngest daughter now.  The way it was filmed puts you in the middle of the musical and lets you see so much more of the characters than you would if you were in the audience.  The cast is truly talented and the music is sublime.  Shows like this will keep the arts alive for generations to come.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|beautiful story. I was surprised at the narrator, and curious how the story could be told in such an unusual way. beautiful book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing, as usual.  It tied things up nicely and left just a few fun questions for... dare I hope... the next installment
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I could write a long review about all the things I find brilliant about that movie. But I'm sure there are already hundreds of good reviews doing that. So I'll just say: if you like computer-animated comedies, you'll love this. Get it. (If you can display 3D, even better, movies like this are made for it.)<br /><br />One of the telling aspects of a great animated film is the LIGHT. And DM2 has it in spades.<br /><br />By the way, I think they make a little mistake by featuring basically only the Minions on covers and such. I feared that the other characters, for example the girls, would take a secondary place to them. Fortunately this is not true, it has a full character gallery, all used well.<br /><br />One of the best new characters is Lucy Wilde, agent of the Anti-Villain League. This adorable redhead is a mess of delightful contradictions: She is bubbly, inventive, tough and super-resourceful, a bit bashful, clumsy, slightly sadistic and yet loving, and a martial-arts master.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is awesome, too bad you lose your 2 coins or gems if you lose your internet connection. Otherwise it's a great game!

B008602KQI|5.0|Never thought that I would have interest in this movie. Just wanted to start watching it to see if my basic assumption that I would not like it was true and then turn it off. Too my surprise found it to be a very good movie and do recommend to others.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's A good game I love it, however I'm giving it a 4* cause sometimes after upgrade it freezes. It becomes frustrating but other than that I'm addicted!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper truly opened up to the world in this captivating memoir. Don't let the Netflix show fool you; this story is real and honest.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Fine for a free book. Minimal to non-existent character development. Supposedly important events occur but then are shoved to the sideline, such as the eagle and the leopard. Abandoned leopard cub that does not need to be fed every hour? PETA and the SPCA would have a field day. Then of course, the fact that time vs distance relationships are absolutely ignored. Crossing half a kingdom in less than half a day on a squire's horse = SMALL kingdom. Even after claims of the Kindle edition being re-edited, I found typesetting errors and a few factual mistakes. Probably won't buy any of the other 8 books in the series, unless snowed in.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I can not say whether the author is correct in his findings.  But I can say that he makes a very credible case for them and one that makes a lot of sense given my limited understanding of the Christian religion.
B0062NAVXA|4.0|This movie was very well done and not overly &#34;preachy.&#34; Enjoyed watching this one. Recommend for others to watch this video.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This was a very entertaining book on many levels, following a teenager grappling with all the trials and tribulations of growing up mixed in with the fear of madness as new found psychic abilities reveal themselves. The concepts of reincarnation and destiny are things many of us think about and this makes Outview an absorbing and fascinating read, made all the more real by the unwanted excursions the lead character is forced to make into some of the horrors of his past lives. This is a very well-thought out, well-written work that balances sophisticated ideas into a page-turning story that adults as well as teenagers can relate to. A deserved 5 stars!

B00GH4RKYM|3.0|While I love Superman...and this Superman especially,  (I did enjoy when he took out General Zod for dissing' his mother!) overall Man of Steel was on and on and on...with better editing it would have been a 4.5 star.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Heavy on bibliography but light on depth and analysis.  Albeit there are few historical facts regarding Jesus, there is enough history of the era to illuminate who this man was and how he managed to change the Western world.<br />Aslan seems to dwell too much on his type of Bill Maharism rejection of religion rather than a real analysis of the historical Jesus.  A Soren Kierkegaard he is not!

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I purchased this when it was $14.99. It is now .99 and it would still not be worth it for me. I have attempted several times to use text and docx files that I have stored on my cloud/in my library. When I access them from the OfficeSuite Pro app, the app says they are not compatible. I have tried every way possible, for hours, to get an \\"acceptable\\" document that I can import and work on in the app. It simply is not working on my Kindle Fire tablets. If anyone knows a way to make this work, I would love to hear it.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ever since I started playing this game I cannot put it down. It's a no-brainer but surprisingly fun. The down side is that you start out with 40 coins which empties fast and it takes time to build it up again. So you can either buy coins, sell your prizes or wait for the coins to build up again. But worth waiting for.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|How perfect to find a New Age fiction writer to reinforce with entertainment the awakening of ones soul!  And the journey continues!
B00FOQRNPA|5.0|Reading this book should be mandatory for everyone, especially those who are overweight or obese (that is not medically caused or related), diabetic, diagnosed with ADHD and mentally-related illnesses.  It is not about this being the truth for everyone; however, it is an option to consider rather man-made drugs that just put more poison and toxins into your body.  Thhose drugs only really 'mask' the problem and do not really cure it.  I believe that the human body can cure itself if you give it the right fuel in many instances and the information and research in this book provides valuable information in how to achieve that.  If you are suffering from any of the illnesses mentioned in this book, or you want to ensure that you don't suffer from them in the future - then I would recommend you read this with an open mind and consider the options it puts forward.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Youtube doesn't load on my Kindle, so I thought 'Why not?' I decided after reading many bad reviews that if I wasn't happy with it, I would just uninstall it.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I wanted to read this book only because it was written by J.K. Rowling. I love the Harry Potter books and was interested to see her book written for adults.<br /><br />I borrowed this from the library, thank goodness. Started reading it and gave up around page 50. From reading other reviews it doesn't look like I missed anything. Way too many characters, way too BORING. I found my mind wandering as I was trying to get into this story. I was thinking about all the other books that I have to read and decided my time was too valuable to waste on something that I wasn't enjoying. Pity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  It is the best game of the year!  You really need to get it because it's awesome!

In her words, this is her review.<br /><br />i really liked the fact that the writing looks like it is handwritten. i also like that it has a picture on each page. I preferred reading this book to watching TV or playing WII. I was so happy when my mom said I could read it!<br /><br />I can honestly say that I love every word in this book-even the end! It had some of the best funny parts, and I love going back and re-reading my favorite parts.

0156030306|4.0|I read this book a couple of years ago. I had seen the movie Charlie when I was young, but this was the first time I read the book. It was a great book--completely enthralling. I would recommend it highly to anyone. There are a few issues here and there--sex and some language issues--but Danile Keyes indeed wrote a book that truly captured the mind of the main character.

0670024856|4.0|I approached THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS with only a vague idea that it was a novel about a female botanist trying to make good in the gentleman's club of nineteenth-century scientific exploration. Well, I wasn't wrong, but I could have been so much more right, if only I had realized that this was a novel about a woman named Alma Whittaker. That might sound like an overly simple statement, but you should not judge it as such until you've met Alma Whittaker, because Alma Whittaker is anything but simple. Alma Whittaker has great depth of character, and because Alma Whittaker has great depth of character, THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS also has great depth, as well as great scope, great humor, great pathos, and great beauty. Don't make my mistake and approach this book thinking that you know what you're going to get, because you don't know, you can't possibly know. Every time you think you know where the story is going, it will surprise you. Every time you think the story is becoming a little sedate, it will gallop ahead again. Every time you think you know all there is to know about the characters who move in Alma's orbit, you will find that you never knew them at all. If you want to go on a great adventure, not of the body but of the soul, take Alma's hand and let her lead you through the winding, witty, whimsical, wondrous pages of THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS.<br /><br />The novel begins with Henry Whittaker's &#34;rags to riches by way of hard work, cunning, and ruthlessness&#34; story. He claws his way to the top, becoming a rare plants and pharmaceuticals baron, one of the richest and most powerful men in Philadelphia, and the proud owner and resident of the great White Acre estate, home to and propagator of both rare plants and rare intellect. Many readers have noted that Henry's story seems to be given too much lengthy attention in a novel that is ostensibly not about him but about his daughter, Alma. However, if this book revolves around Alma, Alma revolves, for much of the book, around Henry and around White Acre, which is almost more a character than merely a location: &#34;White Acre was both magnificent and daunting, especially upon first sight. The place had been expressly designed to intimidate, after all, and few guests could hide their awe, their envy, or their fear.&#34; Now ensconced in White Acre, and having acquired, somewhere along the way, a very sensible, intelligent, and industrious Dutch wife, Beatrix, Henry is now ready to raise a family in the splendor he only dared to dream of when he was a child himself.<br /><br />As fate would have it, Henry and Beatrix are blessed with only one child, a little girl named Alma, born in the year 1800 (which makes it very easy for readers to know how old Alma is whenever a date is mentioned in the story). Surprisingly, Henry is unperturbed at having only a daughter as his sole heir, and he is more than happy for Beatrix to raise Alma under the strictures of a very thorough classical education, while both her parents imbue in Alma a supremely logical and scientific way of thinking, as well as a love of and aptitude for well-reasoned debating, which earns Alma her place at the table during the Whittakers' famous dinner parties, hosting the greatest minds of the age.<br /><br />Growing up at White Acre, all Alma lacks is affection, the companionship of other children, and the time and ability to simply play and waste time. This is where the author's love for Alma becomes very apparent, as she steps in to provide Alma with the remaining components needed to nourish her humanity. An adopted sister, Prudence, appears in the middle of the night when Alma is still quite a young child. However, beautiful, passive Prudence appears ever cold and aloof: &#34;Prudence ... as ever, looked porcelain and unimpeachable.&#34; She initially appears to be a mere cipher, a &#34;not-Alma.&#34; But then the author provides Alma and Prudence with the third power of their triumvirate in the form of their new neighbor, Retta Snow, who, irrepressibly ebullient, immediately adopts Alma and Prudence as her best friends in the whole wide world. Described as &#34;overly young, not very bright, and just the tiniest bit frantic,&#34; Retta casts a friendly spell over all the inhabitants of White Acre, one of the effects of which is to bring Alma and Prudence closer together. If Prudence is &#34;not-Alma,&#34; Retta is &#34;not-Alma-or-Prudence,&#34; and she teaches them the only thing they have left to learn: how to be silly.<br /><br />And so, this is the environment that produces Alma Whittaker. But who is Alma Whittaker? As far as the world around her is concerned, Alma Whittaker is competent, sensible, intelligent, obedient, and amiable. She is also an ugly duckling who never did turn into a swan. Finding her a husband may be problematic: &#34;Who would have her? Who would take this giant female creature, who stood above six feet tall, who was overly stuffed with learning, and who had hair in the color and shape of a rooster's comb?&#34; The world would certainly have to admit, though, that even at a young age, Alma Whittaker is a very promising botanist, despite the fact that: &#34;In the scientific world of the day, there was still a strict division between 'botany' (the study of plants by men) and 'polite botany' (the study of plants by women) ... [even though] 'polite botany' was often indistinguishable from 'botany' ...&#34;<br /><br />This is the point from which Alma's story really begins. Yes, she is everything the world observes her to be - but are any of us merely the sum total of what the world observes us to be? In a narrative voice that has a merrily ironic sense of humor, THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS somehow manages to move along at a hectic, whirlwind pace even when many of its scenes are merely domestic. Alma's fully rounded character is revealed as we are granted intimate insight into the sensual and romantic sides of her psyche. The true scope and intricate nuances of her botanist's brain are revealed when, surrounded by causes like the treatment of women in asylums or the abolitionist movement, Alma takes up the study of MOSSES! This seems either hilarious or infuriating initially, until realization dawns that this may signal Alma's entry into the most exciting issue of the time, the first steps toward a theory of evolution by natural selection. But Alma really is captivated by moss in its own right, and if we scoff at the idea to start with, we are ashamed of our scorn when Alma tells us, &#34;I find the miniature world to be a gift of disguised greatness, and therefore an honor to study.&#34;<br /><br />Alma's already captivating story is thoroughly shaken up and taken to new and surprising heights and depths by two events: the entry of a unique botanical artist by the name of Ambrose Pike and Alma's eventual release from Henry Whittaker's thrall. Ambrose turns Alma's world upside down, so that she has to wonder, exactly what are the borders of reality, and are they fixed? It is because of Ambrose that Alma finally experiences the heady highs of ardent love and the soul-wrenching lows of love lost. This is where THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS shows its greatest depth and Gilbert her most inspired authorship, with breathtaking writing such as: &#34;... truly there were times when the sadness of this world was scarcely to be endured, and the violence of love, Alma thought, was sometimes the most pitiless violence of all.&#34;<br /><br />When the chips are down, Alma is a Whittaker of White Acre, and she will use her power to save her own heart from that which cannot be borne. Yet it is when she finally relinquishes that power forever that she becomes free for the first time in her life. Grasping her new freedom with both hands, Alma goes on an expedition to Tahiti. But are plants really all she is looking for there, or is she looking for answers of a different kind? And if she finds them, will they bringpeace to her life or destroy it?<br /><br />THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS is, indeed, a novel about a nineteenth century woman botanist. It is also a novel about life and death, especially death, and whether the struggle for life is worth it. It is a novel about time, about the almost-infinite &#34;moss time&#34; and about the never-enough human time. It is a novel about altruism and self-sacrifice. It is a novel about the scientific and the mystical. Most of all, it is a novel about Alma Whittaker and what life taught her: &#34;This life is a tentative and difficult experiment. Sometimes there will be victory after suffering - but nothing is promised.&#34;pe and intricate nuances of her botanist's brain are revealed when, surrounded by causes like the treatment of women in asylums or the abolitionist movement, Alma takes up the study of MOSSES! This seems either hilarious or infuriating initially, until realization dawns that this may signal Alma's entry into the most exciting issue of the time, the first steps toward a theory of evolution by natural selection. But Alma really is captivated by moss in its own right, and if we scoff at the idea to start with, we are ashamed of our scorn when Alma tells us, &#34;I find the miniature world to be a gift of disguised greatness, and therefore an honor to study.&#34;<br /><br />Alma's already captivating story is thoroughly shaken up and taken to new and surprising heights and depths by two events: the entry of a unique botanical artist by the name of Ambrose Pike and Alma's eventual release from Henry Whittaker's thrall. Ambrose turns Alma's world upside down, so that she has to wonder, exactly what are the borders of reality, and are they fixed? It is because of Ambrose that Alma finally experiences the heady highs of ardent love and the soul-wrenching lows of love lost. This is where THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS shows its greatest depth and Gilbert her most inspired authorship, with breathtaking writing such as: &#34;... truly there were times when the sadness of this world was scarcely to be endured, and the violence of love, Alma thought, was sometimes the most pitiless violence of all.&#34;<br /><br />When the chips are down, Alma is a Whittaker of White Acre, and she will use her power to save her own heart from that which cannot be borne. Yet it is when she finally relinquishes that power forever that she becomes free for the first time in her life. Grasping her new freedom with both hands, Alma goes on an expedition to Tahiti. But are plants really all she is looking for there, or is she looking for answers of a different kind? And if she finds them, will they bringpeace to her life or destroy it?<br /><br />THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS is, indeed, a novel about a nineteenth century woman botanist. It is also a novel about life and death, especially death, and whether the struggle for life is worth it. It is a novel about time, about the almost-infinite &#34;moss time&#34; and about the never-enough human time. It is a novel about altruism and self-sacrifice. It is a novel about the scientific and the mystical. Most of all, it is a novel about Alma Whittaker and what life taught her: &#34;This life is a tentative and difficult experiment. Sometimes there will be victory after suffering - but nothing is promised.&#34;
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|This is a great movie. I watched this movie twice on TV but I didn't have time to watch the whole, so I ordered one DVD for myself. I don't want to advertise for this movie but it doesn't waste my money and my time to watch this in the Thanksgiving day of 2013. Forest Gump: A simple love of a very profound veteran.

B0012QVJXS|5.0|My 14yr old son and I watched the newest Superman (2013) this weekend and I couldn’t believe how far  away they went from the original.  My son asked what I was talking about.  So instead of telling him I made him watch it with me.  While he liked the visual effects of the new version he got a kick out the old one.  After the movie I asked him if he could tell me how many times they cursed in the movie.  He said he didn’t think they did.  I told him it’s funny how back then they didn’t need to curse to make movies.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I bought &#34;Jess And Julia&#34;, partly b/c I saw several episodes and found them all funny, but also b/c I remembered the last scene in this particular episode where one of the dudes was trying to defend him wearing the other dudes' underwear, and the horrified look on the black dude's face was priceless.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had a good idea of what I was getting into so I was delighted to get my Chromecast.  Since having an iPad and already being aware of how many videos have mobile-access limits, I understood how Chromecast works.  It allows you to &#34;cast&#34; (as-in casting a net in a pond to catch fish) and &#34;reel-in&#34; content from your mobile device (with it's already known video access limits) as well as allowing you to &#34;cast&#34; from your PC or in my case my Mac.<br /><br />Since you first log into the Chromecast device as if it were a wifi hotspot, then log back into your normal wifi Internet, the device itself ends up accessing Internet on its own after its fully installed.  Chromecast will then stream content direct from the Internet and not your device or computer, although it requires your mobile device to be actively engage on the wifi network as a persistent authentication is required to maintain streaming capabilities.  If you have photos and videos on your mobile device (cell or tablet) they may or may not be &#34;cast-able&#34;.  The best option for you is to use a cloud to store your pics (Picasa) and videos (ex. YouTube must be set to &#34;Public&#34;) and share them via apps that work with Chromecast.<br /><br />You can also use Google Chrome browser, add the Chromecast extension and be able to &#34;cast&#34; or transmit if you prefer everything from your computer, except of course audio which must be output by your computer's audio port.  What I love most is how portable it is, basically the size a thumb drive and you can take it anywhere you have an HDTV and want to bring your Netflix, HBO Go or other supported content.  Since Google still owns Google TV and Widevine's technology, I'm sure they'll be more to come soon I'm sure!
B000083C49|5.0|I like this movie very, very, very much.  I had this movie in VHS, but I would like to have my own DVD, so I brought this DVD.  The reason that I love this movie, let me explain.  Mr. Spock asked a person to turn it down his radio, but he refused.  Mr. Spock put him to sleep and turned down his radio.  People on the bus applauded him.

6302373972|5.0|Prime-time Lou Reed performance. The Man is captured here at the definite peak of his powers. One would think it's impossible to improve upon a masterpiece --- the &#34;New York&#34; album --- but Lou & his crew manage to accomplish that very feat in this concert. The studio recordings are 'bested' by the fiery, passionate playing by the musicians & the totally committed 'take-no-prisoners' vocals delivered by Mr. Reed. Live Rock doesn't get better than that documented on this video.<br /><br />My favorite segment of the show is when the band plunges in to &#34;Busload of Faith,&#34; &#34;Sick of You,&#34; &#34;Hold On&#34; & then follows those up with a thunderous reading of &#34;Good Evening Mr. Waldheim.&#34; A transcendent musical moment indeed.<br /><br />I've wanted to add this video to my collection for nearly 23 years. Now that I think about it, I've really desired some form of visual documentation of Lou's &#34;New York&#34; Tour ever since I attended his show at the Palace Theater in Columbus, Ohio in March, 1989. That gig was a stellar performance, like this one, & was also filmed. Where is that footage today?<br /><br />While I absolutely love this video in its 'as is' state, I do have two suggestions for improvements on a reissue of this title. 1) The entire concert needs to be released on DVD. The performance of the &#34;New York&#34; album, in its entirety, was only the beginning of the show; other selections were played, encores need to be included. In Columbus, I recall a very potent version of &#34;Vicious&#34; being offered as the final encore. 2) A 'deluxe edition' DVD(s) of this concert (filmed at Montreal's Theatre St. Denis on August 13, 1989) should be made available to the general public, with bonus discs containing interviews & the complete March, 1989 Palace Theater gig in Columbus.<br /><br />Dear Laurie Anderson, are you listening? Will you please be so kind as to treat us to a gift such as this?

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is such an original, mainly being known as &#34;Scariest game ever&#34;, and I would definitely agree. Slender Man! Chapter 1: Alone has a little twist. These maps are (I don't think) not part of the PC game.<br /><br />The first one, &#34;Road&#34;, is a medium-sized map that of course, is a road that leads through the woods. According to a billboard, it is 100 miles away from Arizona. There are 3 buildings; two houses and a big building. The pages aren't much of a challenge, and aren't super hidden. This one is a good map for beginners.<br /><br />The second one, &#34;Farm&#34; is a bigger map. It has a few buildings; a barn, windmill, and I think a couple more. In this one, the pages are hidden well. This map is a great map for the players who want a fun challenge.<br /><br />The &#34;Road&#34; map was very easy to me, I had won it on the first try. Farm I had quite a hard time and it took a few tries.<br /><br />When you start a game, you get the option of &#34;Easy&#34;, &#34;Medium&#34;, or &#34;Hard&#34;. Then you get the option of &#34;Day&#34; or &#34;Night.&#34; Easy is perfect for the beginners. Medium is for the ones with the expierience of Slender. Hard is for the master Slender players. Day is obviously daytime. It makes it ALOT easier to see. Night makes it nighttime, and makes it very hard to see.<br /><br />What made me take a star off was that the turning is very slow and &#34;Glitchy&#34;. When you turn, it teleports around and then makes it hard to grab pages.<br /><br />I give this app a **** (4 stars) It definitely beats any other on the Appstore.

0545626382|5.0|The new movie out was amazing #1  but this box set is a great start for people who are new to the trilogy. This box set idea makes me want to write more books more towards a novel format.

B005NFJAT4|5.0|DVD arrived in good shape. My husband and I watch this movie every 4th of July. It is a moving story, with personal glimpses into the hearts of several of the Union and Confederate leaders, very true to Jeff Shara's Killer Angels. The soundtrack is incredibly stirring. We are not Civil War buffs at all, but we love this movie. Jeff Daniels has done some terrible acting in his day, but he outdoes himself in this one.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Really worth the length. Loved this book and can't wait for the next book in the series. And hopefully another two movies in the making!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I liked it! Very fitting end to the series. There was lots of action, lots of love, happy and sad tears, twists and turns... and of course, some deaths along the way.<br /><br />Words cannot express how much I love Aiden. His throne in the Book Boyfriend Hall of Fame should be bronzed or dipped in platinum, then bedazzled with a billion jewels. Or maybe something more manly or rustic-y... but you get my drift. Gods, he would do anything for Alex just like she would do for him.<br /><br />&#34;He was my strength when I needed him to be, my friend when I needed someone to talk me down, my equal in a world where by law I would always be less than him, and honest to gods, he was the love of my life.<br /><br />And he would wait forever for me, just as I would wait forever and a day for him.&#34;<br /><br />Plain and simple: Alex + Aiden = True Love. No doubt about it. If you're a fan of this series then you already know this! :) I LOVED every kiss, hug, touch... especially when it was done in front of other pure-bloods. Yea, take that and shove it!<br /><br />And let me just say, I'm Team Aiden all the way but Seth... I have a soft spot for him. He's been through a lot too, granted, he's been more of a bad guy lately but still... Let's just say he definitely makes some changes in Sentinel.<br /><br />I was a little worried with where things were headed at the end but then I went, &#34;Yea, I could work with what I think is gonna happen...&#34; Then, I went not too much later, &#34;YES! I knew there was a way to make dreams come true! Thank Gods!!&#34;<br /><br />P.S. That Apollo is quite the clever guy...

B0084AZXKK|5.0|it was suspenseful and I enjoyed the characters. It's a book you can reread every few years. One does not realize how much it has contributed to our culture- 16 men on a deadman's chest is a phrase every one knows. Of note, one can compare the pirates to our present day gangs-sociopaths do not change with time.
B005529EI2|1.0|The first of the extended editions was captioned. You could watch this extremely long movie which has a great variety in volume level without disturbing others, as you could see the captions. In addition, you didn't miss dialog which is not always so clear, as there were captions. What does Gandolf  say last in the first movie? I only know because of the captions. He says \\"Fly, you fools\\". It's really important to know what he says and how he's looking at the situation.<br /><br />The extended edition for the first movie was great! There was much more detail about the worlds and character development, which to me are the best parts. I'm hoping the same is true for this edition.<br /><br />The third extended edition also has captions. So, what happened to this one?! I thought we could count on captions these days. Everyone benefits from captions even those without hearing impairments, like myself. In addition, they are essential for many of those with hearing impairments.

I couldn't even see the ready to cast screen on my tv!  It is cheap for a reason people.  I bought a roku and I am hoping it works better.  All I wanted was to watch Netflix on my big screen tv.
B00447L4JG|5.0|What's the Halloween movie that also gets everyone excited for Christmas? Tim Burton's \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" of course, which even goes so far as to throw in a dash of Easter as well. Having long-since been established as a holiday classic, there's a good chance that anyone reading this review has already watched the film countless times, so let me try and tell you something you *don't* know about it...<br /><br />Contrary to the name on the poster, Tim Burton did not direct \\"Nightmare\\" nor even write the screenplay. The task of directing went to Henry Selick (who would go on to direct the brilliant [[ASIN:B002BWCJOA Coraline]]) whilst Caroline Thompson wrote the script. Burton's contribution was a sketch-book full of quirky character designs and a basic idea inspired by the holiday TV specials [[ASIN:B003P3PQOO Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer]] and Doctor Suess's [[ASIN:B001M6KTM0 How the Grinch Stole Christmas]].<br /><br />In fact, \\"Nightmare\\" can best be described as an amalgamation of the two: combining the stop-motion animation of Rudolph with an inverted Grinch as the story's protagonist. As it turns out, Jack Skellington doesn't want to destroy Christmas because he hates it. He LOVES Christmas, so much so that he nearly ruins it in his attempts to hi-jack it for himself.<br /><br />The residents of Halloween Town - witches, ghouls, goblins and many more - all come together on Halloween night in order to enjoy getting thoroughly spooked. Leading the celebrations is Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, but lately he's been feeling rather melancholy. It turns out that he's tired of the same old routine and is on the lookout for something new and fresh. After a long walk in the forest he comes across a strange portal that leads him to a place called Christmas Town. Instantly delighted by the colour and magic it provides, he resolves to introduce it to the townsfolk back home.<br /><br />They're eager enough to get on board with Jack's new passion, despite the reservations of the down-to-earth rag doll Sally, but simply replicating the holiday isn't enough for Jack. Nothing else will do but that he seize control of Christmas and take the role of Santa Claus (or \\"Sandy Claws\\" as he's mistakingly called) for himself. As you can imagine this doesn't go well, especially not for Santa, left to the mercy of the horrid Bogeyman...<br /><br />There is a timelessness to stop-motion animation that spares it from ever looking old or dated (unlike some of the earliest computer animated films), and twenty years on \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" still looks as gorgeous and grotesque as ever. For the style and atmosphere of the film, the creators turned to the etched pencilled quality found in the works of Edward Gorey and Charles Addams, rending Halloween Town a creepy yet beautiful place, complete with a colour palette of black, white and orange.<br />Also worth noting is Danny Elfman, composer and long-time collaborator with Burton (in fact, he's provided the scores for most of his feature films). The musical numbers are integral to the storytelling process, each one catchy and memorable, and Elfman even provides the singing voice for Jack.<br /><br />The imaginative force behind the creation of the film results in a number of iconic characters, from the spidery Jack Skellington to the stitched-up rag-doll Sally, as well as the distinctive residents of Halloween Town: from the (literally) two-faced Mayor to Jack's ghostly dog Zero. Even Santa gets in on the action, portrayed as a no-nonsense harbinger of joy and good tidings, who nevertheless won't stand for his own kidnapping.<br /><br />It seems strange to think that when the film was first released back in 1993, Disney decided to release it under Touchstone Pictures, deeming it too scary for small children. Since becoming a massive hit, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" has since been fully embraced by Disney, going so far as to give it a 3-D conversion and refurnish Disneyland's Haunted Mansion every Halloween with \\"Nightmare\\" characters. The latest DVD release is full of special features, including deleted scenes, storyboards and behind-the-scenes featurettes, shedding insight on the creative process.<br /><br />Though some of the imagery might be a bit too intense for the *very* young, there's a reason why \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" has stood the test of time and is now considered a classic. With the fun subversion of villains and heroes, a protagonist who means well but nearly destroys Christmas for everyone, and a sincere celebration of the holidays, this is one of those films that will be brought out every year to get you in the right mood for Halloween - or Christmas.yland's Haunted Mansion every Halloween with \\"Nightmare\\" characters.

B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Waited a long time for a new album, and was little worried that it would be different from what I've come to expect from Mazzy Star.  That isn't an issue though, this album fits right into their catalog, from the first track, to the last, you absolutely know who you're listening to.  The CD jewel box is cardboard and there's no booklet or anything, so don't get your hopes up for anything fancy if you order the CD.  No complaints at all, happy to see them touring and putting out fresh music.

0340822783|4.0|This book was amazing. I read the book before I saw the movie. It's not an easy read as you have to shift gears between vastly different storylines, but it is an unforgettable, original, and beautiful piece of fiction. It also, for me, started off slowly and it took awhile for me get into the storyline.  The most compelling chapters were the ones on Somni and the most off-putting storyline had to do with Zachary, only because it was written in the island dialect. I want to read other books by this author.

B000EWBKK8|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. Great story of how Ukranian immigrants in the US get the urge to make lots of money by selling guns on a mass scale to warn torn countries. We see the effect of these weapons on the countries as well as the effect of selling these guns on the main characters and their family. Overall amazing movie and the quality is superb here on amazon.

B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Other than the personalized options for the backdrop, i dont see how this is the best freecell game. There are free versions of this game which i personally think have better controls and i can live without a special background. I wouldnt waste my 99&cent;&hellip;

B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This is a great version of Free Cell for mobile devices - but it is really too small on my phone. I'd recommend it for tablets only.<br />Although I did see several commenters state the game did not play on their devices, I had no problem with the Kindle Fire HD. The cards moved as I expected and the game play is true to the version that was on my PC several years ago.<br /><br />I did not find any intrusive permissions and it is not a large file, so if you like Free Cell, this is a good option.

B00GQ051NY|1.0|It really feels like Dexter production went through austerity measures. Everything from the writing to film work is amateur quality.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|A great movie for all ages. The humor is gentle and the relationship between Gru and his little girls is adorable!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I realy liked this product because its a sad story but a true story and apart of American history. The color and contract is amazing and the sound and music is awsome.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's good the game is really fun to play underhand funded kiddo kids landed discussions Nanak Jansen kickoff month duck kindle kiddo knocks
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Come on, it's Brian and the Boys!  Brian also brings along one terrific backup band.  As much as Mike Love can be a pain in the butt, his recording is superb.
0439023491|4.0|Good follow up to THG and good bridge to book 3.  A lot of telling and not showing, which knocks a star off.
0143038419|4.0|True to the motion picture.  I wish I could take the journey she did and come out with the same ending.
0439023513|3.0|I was rather disappointed with the conclusion of the Hunger Games trilogy.  It seems like things were happening TOO Katniss, rather than her taking charge and making things happen.  We are told, not shown.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I HATED that the author ended up killing Primm.  WTH??? It's rare I get upset at a characters death, but this one really got me.  It seemed so unnecessary after all Katniss went through to keep her safe.<br /><br />I also did not like Gale turned sort of evil.  It seemed like a cop-out plot device to make Katniss choose Peeta.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it......completely useless at it tho! Very addictive. I will get no housework done till I can beat my daughter!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Great to watch for any Dr Who fan.  My Hubby ordered this as a surprise and I was glad he did!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I used to play this game all the time on my computer.  Nowadays I'm on my Kindle Fire HD most of the time rather than the laptop,  and didn't realize how much I missed FreeCell.<br /><br />This is just like the Windows game.  At first it threw me  off having the Aces on the top left and the open cells on the top right.  However, just like most of the things that reviewers are complaining about,  that can be changed by accessing the menu options.<br /><br />When I first downloaded the game, I didn't open it right away.  I turned off my WiFi and later when I tried to open and play it, it told me that there was an error and to reload it from the store.  Hmmmmm.  So I did, and this time it did open and play when I left my WiFi on.  So I thought, Geez, that's suspicious, why would you have to have WiFi on?  But now it will play without, so hopefully it was just coincidence.<br /><br />Good game, no other problems.  Would have liked an Exit option, though.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I didn't miss an episode of this during it's long reign on TV so was thrilled to add it to my collection.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Excellent app. Give me access to my email when I'm on the go. I'm sure millions of smartphone users will find this app as useful as I did.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a nice looking alarm clock app and it works pretty well.  There are different clock styles and ringers to choose from and they are all loud enough to hear.  A lot of these digital alarm clocks don't ring that loudly.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Actually,it was pretty obvious who  the laughing man was.Refer to the phrase &#34;smart kid&#34; in the book.<br />I liked the way the series of events unfold,the bullet-point chapters where everything is is explained to you and the chapter headings.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game is a cross between Pain from the PlayStation network and Angry Birds.  You are a tennis player and you are taking out the bad guys with a tennis racket and balls.  There are things that can help you - glass, debris, dynamite, etc.  Every level is a little more complex in the way you have to reach them.  I'm not much for this sort of game, but I did have a lot of fun playing it and this one I can see why someone can get addicted to the gameplay.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Amazing show! Made me stay up late at night, watching episode after episode and keeping my husband awake.<br /><br />I only got this because it has great ratings. I have heard of the show in the past but never paid attention. Wow, I've been missing out! The show is marvelous. I love Chris Noth (Mr. Big). And there are a ton of other amazing actors in here too, all great.<br /><br />Get this! All the good ratings are true. This show really is wonderful. And the first season here is about 17 hours (some 20 episodes) of TV with no commercials. The price is totally reasonable.<br /><br />There is just one drawback. Makes you lose sleep and can't get anything done! But that's the price you pay for all good shows.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was a little hesitant with reading this novel. I fell in love with Neverwhere and American Gods but knew that he had strayed away from adult novels. Seeing a lot of 5 star reviews, I decided to pick it up anyway. I cannot say that I was disappointed, but I did feel a little let down. I felt like this was more of a teenage fairy tale than adult. Nowhere near the likes of American Gods, but good enough for me to finish. I would highly recommend getting it from the library instead of spending money on it.
B00BIK3FAI|2.0|Giving this a 2 star rating as it doesn't work on my Nexus 10 tablet, although Amazon's website indicates that it's compatible.  Not sure what's up with that.  So, the program will fire up &#34;slowly-takes 30 seconds to get to the main page&#34;.  Then it just sorta hangs, and won't respond, but the audio keeps playing.  After 20 seconds or so, a dialog box pops up saying that the application is unresponsive.  Tried re-booting the tablet, no go.  Tried installing the &#34;Lite version&#34;, no go.  It's a shame, because it looks like a cute app, hopefully the developers will see this and fix this issue.  Was running the latest version of Jelly Bean when it didn't originally work, now running Kit Kat, still no go.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|This is the perfect Halloween suspense, along with the original Halloween movie. This is a timeless classic. \\"They're all gonna laugh at you!\\" BTW....I hate all the remakes and DVD sequels. This original is a keeper!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love whisper sync.  Sitting in the doctor's office I can pick up right where I left off on any of my other devices, see my highlights and notes.  I love Kindle!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|this is a very addictive game yet very challenging, especially as you move up in levels! great brain teaser. try not to use the hints!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This has become my new favorite book. The originality of the writing style and point of view  coupled with the precise words that illicit so any strong emotions make this book a master piece.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|One of the best TV shows I ever seen! Great script, amazing actors! Only good thing could I say about it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|You get to buy weapons that help you kill many wild animals if you play this you will have fun believe me
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The graphics are amazing and the hole game is very fun and addicting<br />I absolutely love it and there is multiplayer too
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun I loved it I have so so so much fun I play it all the time  I learn like all the time
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great book, good movie. I found it pretty entertaining, its hard to make movie exactly like the books but I think they did a pretty good job. You don't have to be a fan of the books to enjoy this movie.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|This is my favorite sound track of all time. Hands down. Expertly arranged with the intention of capturing the liveliness of the 1920's era jazz and swing by mixing in todays popular hip hop, it is a musical masterpiece.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Sooooo stupid and disappointing.... Talk about a low-budget flick! The 'space ship' is made of Saran wrap, rope, PVC tubes, cheap plastic molds, and paper mache.  Will Smith is an über egomaniac.  His attitude may or may not be warranted but it is loathsome to see his young son strutting about with a similar demeanor; having not yet earned his acting chops.  Also, 50% of the time (and I am being kind) Jaden Smith can barely enunciate his words and what does come through is a weird, watered-down, British accent. The Will Smith character has an American accent. And what's up with the mother and the daughter? They look like identical twins. What really makes this movie dumb and RACIST is Jaden Smith's propensity to oversleep throughout the movie a la Lincoln Perry.  Just dreadful. Pass on this stinker. You have been warned.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I liked the ending but found it too &#34;perfect&#34;.  Totally enjoyed the concept and the love &#34;affair&#34; with both the flowers and with Grant. Beautifully written
B0055SWM08|4.0|Pretty easy to start, gets a little harder the longer you play. Can usually figure it out, but gets more unpredictable as you go. Great time waster!
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|I think I'll give this 3 stars instead of two as I watched this thinking it was going to be a comedy.<br /><br />It struck me as sad and odd (as I don't know anything about the disorder) so I had a problem relating to the characters.  Good acting though.  I'll have to rewatch it now that I know what to expect.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I had a hard time staying focused at first, took awhile to weave the story lines together.  Really well written, could definitely see this becoming a movie.  Must read be epilogue.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use my kindle to read books, play games and read emails it cleaned up my kindle like new thank you very much
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good verdict, details  before trial began a bit tedious, but story behind the reason for the will excellent.  The tread of John Grishams  story telling ability comes thru.
0525478817|5.0|This book was an unexpected––but very definite––life changer. I'm in my mid-twenties, and wouldn't have otherwise picked up this book, but I had an obligation to do so, and I'm very glad I heeded it.<br /><br />Given that it's been almost two years since I read it, and its effects are still as vibrant today as they ever were - I can confidently attest that this book stands the test of time. Shortly after reading it, I wrote a little diary entry about my experience, which fairly-adequately conveys the emotions I experienced...<br /><br />&#34;It was late. It was a fairly warm evening for a January in Utah, dry, and still. The darkness outside was the kind you could almost smell. It was calm, silent, and the stars were so visible, it was almost as if the moon was calling for backup in order to light the city below.<br /><br />I was on the couch nearest the front window in my living room, and I had been there for about 7 hours that day – getting up only to eat and go to the bathroom, and when I ate, I brought the food right back onto the couch so I could continue to read. It had been such a long time since I was able to get so engrossed in a book. Let alone a fictional book, primarily geared toward an adolescent audience.<br /><br />And yet here I was, devouring page after page. I had a goal in mind, a bigger purpose for reading the book, otherwise I wouldn’t have spent all day reading it, let alone would I have justified breaking my 3-year-long “fast” from reading fiction. But as I read the last few chapters, the goal didn’t matter anymore. I was emotional. I was full of insights and perspective. And most of all, I was anxious to finish the book so I could go and speak with my wife.<br /><br />As I teared up, reading the last few lines of the book, I got up and began to look for my wife. She had been playing the drums for the better half of the day, and working on a video that she would be publishing the following morning. But almost by magic, she walked into the front room just as I decided to go looking for her.<br /><br />She saw the look in my eyes, and knew I needed her presence and full attention. I looked deeply into her eyes and gently placed my hand on her cheek. I could tell she was uncomfortable just enough at first, having been working on her video, it was a bit of an adjustment to pull herself completely into the moment. But it didn’t matter to me. Not then.<br /><br />I poured my heart to her, as tears streamed down my face. “I love you, Mari. It is such a privilege that I get to love you. How lucky am I that I get that opportunity?”<br /><br />As I expressed my heart’s intent openly, she began to open up. I’m intimately familiar with that look in her eyes, where her pupils begin to widen, her deep, dark brown retinas begin to blend with the shade of her pupils, and they glow. It’s a sweet feeling, swimming in a little sea of infinity. As the author John Green put it, &#34;some infinities are bigger than others.&#34; And this moment was our little infinity, stretching out beyond space and time, a connection that could not be penetrated by fear or shadows, or distracted by noise and excitement. This was love, and it was melting us in the moment. It felt like our ceremony on our wedding day, but so much more simple. This was raw authenticity, immersed in the honor and privilege of having the opportunity to love one another.&#34;<br /><br />I can't give all of the credit to the book, because I proactively created such a deep, integrated experience facilitated by the emotion the book inspired. But the feeling has never faded. Every day, I am thankful for the privilege of getting to love my wife. Whether she’s being a complete joy to be around, as we explore and experiment and create great things together and converse late into the night, or if she’s frustrating me, doubting herself and questioning her worth, letting her anger for the hurt in the world get the best of her – I just feel damn lucky and privileged to get to love her.<br /><br />I highly recommend you get this book, immerse yourself in it, and make manifest whatever emotions it may ignite within you.l damn lucky and privileged to get to love her.<br /><br />I highly recommend you get this book, immerse yourself in it, and make manifest whatever emotions it may ignite within you.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Beautiful packaging on this set.  A book slides out of the sleeve and inside the book are wonderful pictures with the cd's inside.  Very neat! I have photos I'm going to try to submit.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I am a big fan of American Horror, but these episodes I missed for some reason, so I ordered them via Amazon Channel. They are scary and out of sorts. But I am still enjoying them.
0061122416|5.0|My favorite book of all time!  Never gets old, and always inspiring.  This is one book I will keep reading again and again.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a well told story that makes the perils of that great war so personal. There is great character development and well described detail of the horrific events that unfolded during that time.
B003K16PFU|5.0|My grandad on my father's side was in several Spanish prisons. His survival he owed to strength, providence and Grandma's love and packages which I have records of. After he was finally released they fled to Venezuela with their 2 sons where Mom married dad and I was born.<br />Grandma was angry with Grampa for expressing his political opinions and associating with the \\"wrong\\" crowd which landed him in prison for 7 or so years.<br />Orwell's accounts amaze me, and it saddens me that his actions and those of many others couldn't keep Franco from taking over.  That Orwell's wife suffered for his risks, I have much compassion.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like playing The Secret Society Hidden Mystery game.  I find it challenging when the game constantly changes the manner in which you find the items. Once I figured out you get bonuses from the pieces at the top of the board it made it nicer. Haven't had to spend a penny to play!
B00DOPEGAS|3.0|Rubberbands were good some broken. the rubber band loom didn't hold rubberbands that great can't put multiple rubberbands on it b/c they fling off..
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Awesome movie, pokes fun at itself while being very watchable. I know the cast of star trek also got a kick out of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is highly addictive! Love the bright color scheme. The music reminds me of an old time carnival. Great way to de-stress.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Sped through this book over two plane rides at thanksgiving and really enjoyed it. The mixing of the stories was really well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to download book three.  I can not wait to see what happens next to Peeta, Katniss and what is in Distric 13.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|ABOUT GAME<br />This game is a platform game. You shoot zombies and collect coins. To beat a level, you have to get to the other door(ALIVE).<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />You probably have read the other comments, and they most likely said something bad about the controls. They probably didn't know that there is an option that adjusts the controls, so you can make it just right for you.<br /><br />CRASHES<br />It might crash every once in a while, but you can just press &quot;wait&quot; on the pop up. The wait button will just continue the game.<br /><br />CONTENT<br />If you are a parent then this is the section to pay attention to. The content is, in my opinion, rated E+10(everyone 10 years old and up).<br />It contains a little bit of pixel blood on ONE creature. You do shoot at the zombies, but there is no blood. When they die they deplete, and when you die you just respawn. There is no blood, gore, sexual themes, or stronge language. I would let kids at least 8 years old play. Unless you are one of those parents that let their kids play M rated games when they are 7.<br /><br />COMBAT<br />There is a jump button and a shoot button. You can dodge attacks, or shoot at the enemies. That is all.<br /><br />RATE<br />I rate this game 50 gum drops, 10 gold, 3 killing sprees, and 1 golden toilet.<br /><br />Thx for reading, press yes for this comment pls!
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|It was not nearly as good as the first two books. It felt much more drawn out, and the ending seemed rushed considering it was the final story in the trilogy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An excellent book unlike any I have ever read.  An almost whimsical literary style of writing concerning a subject matter that is certainly not whimsical.
6305428425|5.0|I love this dingy yet hilarious movie. Lisa Kudro does a great job in this movie. She and Mira Sorvino are very entertaining.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The Star Trek reboots are fun and well thought out. They are enjoyable for fans and those new to the genre. It was well cast and very exciting.
076780421X|5.0|Fools Rush In is one of my favorite movies. The chemistry between Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek is great. You really get into the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book is so funny. Damn you Tina Fey why did you make me want to see more of you right before 30 Rock went off the air?<br /><br />She's hilarious, self deprecating and she points out flaws in the industry. It's a book that you should read when you're feeling down or just want a quick laugh. You don't need to know squat about who she is. Just read it and you'll laugh and laugh.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|After watching this movie I have changed my views on Seaworld. Unsure if I'll ever take my children to seaworld.
0345528581|5.0|I love this book.  It has a lot of great information.<br /><br />I also love how Mike Lauren is really accessible in real life.  He takes the time to answer people's questions, and answer them thoroughly.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|OVERALL GOOD GOOD VERY GOOD . Keeps me busy I guess it's a great game u know man.Alright in some areas
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|Awesome movie!. However not that much POP OUT 3-D action but it's cool anyway. Good thing you don't go to a movie theater because of the cost with 3-D glasses, not worth it. At home, it's worth it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is great it has great graphics and is very easy to play the campaign is awesome because you can be on both sides the villains and the heroes. This game isn't like nova 3 it has actual guns instead of sniper rifle or assault rifle the multiplayer is great but there are some hackers the game can easily be a platform system game I would love to see this game on ps4.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Its ok. Chose to read it because of the hype. Follows the same pattern of any romance novel. * *
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty decent. It is a good simulation of an actual city.  I like how much control you have over everything in the city.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|Great game it is a lot of fun. the only thing I.don't like.is that you have to wait real time for.things to get done.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Unbelievably amazing story. The best of the series so far! I couldn't stop watching it and plan to see it again soon with my daughters.
B00DGL3ILS|5.0|One of the Kreator Concerts ever!! Love the video and sound Quality!! Nice Product for any trasher collector!!. KREATOR RULES!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app! Easy and quick. Better then the website. I use this app everyday and its fun and love talking to my friends
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Best way to reach customers family and friends from around the world.  Meet new people and reconnect with people you totally forgot about.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This is a very powerful film. Denzel Washington, as is usual, performs wonderfully and with great emotion in this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game. But it kicks you out after so many tries and you have to pay to get more lives or wait for so long. That's very frustrating.  But it's fun and challenging other than that.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Hoping DC will give us one more go as 007. Really enjoyable tips of the hat to the older movies. Sometimes the old ways are best.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love this game it has all kinds of hidden things to do the grafts are amazing and the sound is Crystal clear the story is very mysterious and keeps you on the edge this is a must have game
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Wonderful documentary on reggae legend Bob Marley.  It is a must see for any Bob Marley fan and  also well worth watching for those who do not know much about Bob Marley or his music.
B001NLKT60|2.0|Good story but such a heavy style.... half book could be spared... useless details... unrealistic skills for this character, lost credibility of first book
0812984412|5.0|Just a wonderful book, amazing story telling. Read it because I attended an event where he was the featured speaker. I figured anyone that personally engaging had to be a great writer and I was not disappointed.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a great classic about the adventures of Tom Sawyer and his friends I recommend this book to anybody with a thirst of adventure.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|Beautiful animated! I want to see it again! The characters were lovable. Kept me completely entertained throughout. Saw it in 3D completely worth it.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It was fantastic. I liked the different ways you learn.  Having to translate back and forth helped. As did having to type the translation. Another thing I liked was how it explained what you did wrong.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this version. I play on my droid andon my fire. Occasionally it will freeze whichnis a bit irritating but free game snd works great for the most part.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Cool book I can't wait to read the sequel very cool awesome very surprised  I recommend it to everyone matt
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|LOVE this game, but this will NOT connect to Facebook so I don't have neighbors and I want to expand my farm!!!! PLEASE FIX OR I CAN'T PLAY ANYMORE!!!! Please fix!!! Anyone else have this problem????
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game, yes you need facebook to be able to use the sea trade portion but what I really like is that you don't have to have fb friends that also play to &quot;help you&quot; in order to complete missions. Most of my fb friends don't play, so I still get the enjoyment without having to annoy them all the time.
0060794410|5.0|Interesting book with some great management tips.  Although this book is not brand new it still has some leadership principles that apply today.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing!! I was so deprecated at the end! John Green you are an amazing author and I hope all your other books are as amazing as this one
B000BNI99K|5.0|this is one of my favorite CD collections.  I play them almost weekly and sing along with Mr. Stewart.  He has a great take on some of the best songs ever written.  His gravelly voice does the songs justice!!  Bravo to him.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|It's so fun to read a book about underdogs that prevail against overdogs. If you enjoy reading underdog success stories, you will love this book.  It may give you hope in taking on the Illuminati, New World Order, CIA, Walmart, or other overdogs.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Doesn't play sound correctly on my Xbox kinect. I wasted my money had to rent it from direct tv instead
B0029VUV70|5.0|Very well done, we need more thought-provoking movies like this. Superb acting. I particularly liked the actor who played the young Michael.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|Excellent movie!  Ashton Kutcher did a tremendous job portraying Steve Jobs!!!  Pretty amazing movie to know more about the history of Apple
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I read this book for the first time almost 50 years ago.  I always remembered it fondly, and once I had the time I read it again.  It remains in my mind a masterpiece, an astounding and insightful piece of literature.
B00466HM28|4.0|It does what it claims, its Ultra Portable, which is very useful in situations where you can't move a lot of equipment. The pads and knobs work perfectly, and I love that the software that has lets you customize every knob and pad midi message, which is awesome
B0063IH60K|3.0|I play this a lot, and like/love it--until the inevitable ad that won't run the video but won't stop the audio, or the ones that just shut down EVERYTHING. I would pay for an ad-free version--and did pay for another developer's version--but this one is not a available ad-free. So downloader beware.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|It was free with my camera purchase. It's a sturdy bag, and it's easy to carry. It is just a bit small when I have to fit two lenses inside.
0739359320|5.0|John Grisham knows how to write suspenseful and compelling novels.  This was no exception.  I recommend it highly.  A very good read!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The product information did not make it clear that this can only be used with compatible (i.e. Google) apps and not to mirror your desktop.  I wanted to be able to look at my photos, stream from Facebook and anything else from my desktop.  So I returned it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent writing.  I literally was spellbound until the end.  I recommend this for a wonderful read.  It could have been longer.  I was sorry to have it end.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I personally do not enjoy writing with the Cosmonaut because I prefer to write notes with a fluid motion. I take lecture notes for 6 hours straight on some days, and it tires my hand out very quickly with the Cosmonaut. I also tried the AluPen by Just Mobile, and that stylus was far better suited to my writing style, and far more comfortable in my hands for a large period of time. I like breaking out the Cosmonaut occasionally to draw, but I sometimes get frustrated with how much force I have to press down with in order for the iPad to register it. This was consistent even after a breaking in period, unfortunately. Still, if you like the feel of big crayon in your hands, this could be the pick for you.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really enjoy this puzzle set plenty of freebies and great graphics.  Only negative is it does eat up the battery fairly quickly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Darn cant crush!  So addictive!  I really hate that it's available on kindle now.  I'll never get my laundry done!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|It is always good to watch this movie and get inspired and laugh.  We had student from spain that requested it
0765338149|3.0|Okay, I REALLY didn't get what all the fuss is about! My hairdresser told me this is her all time fav science fiction book. I kept plodding through only to end up disappointed. The &#34;surprise&#34; ending wasn't really that much of a surprise. It did make me wonder, though, if our government could pull of a similar scenario given all the (warranted) distrust swirling around.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I love this app but I can't play unless I'm connected to the Internet. I tried deleting the app then re-installing it to see if that worked. Still having issues with it and I lost all my progress
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|bryson is a a fascinating writer,always entertaining &informative. you always learn interesting things when you read his books.you make rating too  much trouble
B001BANK32|5.0|Register after reading Dr Sleep.  Still a good read.  I think I`'ll revisit the movie.  I really like that version of the tale too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I told myself I wasn't going to be like the others and I'd just take a peak at all the rave.  Totally hooked and can't stop playing!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I started to read this book, I stopped, and  read The Shining. Like most people, you I cannot rely on the movie. Now that I read the shining, it made Sleep Doctor that much better. A book in the true sense of Stephen King. I'm glad he explored the life of Dan Torrance. Should it be a movie? Well, if that happens, it will take a lot of work, to bring all the magic out for the visual learners.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I purchased 2 of these, one for a friend. They work so well.  You can hear clearly, you can easily turn it on and off, and the best, is the battery last many weeks without charging!
031623480X|4.0|I feel that the information in this book will change my life.  I have begun to forget a few things, although I remember them later. I do not want to get in the position of not knowing my family members, as time goes on.  That possibility is so very scary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive! Played it once and now I can't stop! If you connect through Facebook, you can get additional lives from Facebook friends also playing.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I’ve known the broad outline of Jane Eyre’s plot for a long time, of course, but that never made me want to read the book. Tragic orphan, cruel boarding school, fiercely brooding Rochester, mad wife in the attic, etc, etc. It all sounded overblown, almost ridiculously gloomy, and far too melodramatic for my taste. Then I read the book and, WOW,  after (for me) a slow start it wasn’t what I anticipated at all.<br /><br />I did not expect the wonderful relationship between Rochester and Jane, with mutual respect and lots of playful, witty banter. I did not expect the harrowing terror I felt when Jane flees Rochester’s house after the big reveal, on her own and without resources.  But the biggest difference between my anticipation and reality is that I in no way expected that what would really make the book for me is Jane herself. To say she is spunky is not right, but she is smart, lively, principled, and determined. Her first person narration lays open her heart in a way that captured my mine, and her life journey moved me more than I would ever have guessed.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Great movie for kids.<br />my kids loved this movie; they watched it over and over! It made for a smooth car ride.
0307352153|5.0|Read this for my business bookclub, and it was one of our groups' favorites. It gave extroverts insight into what it's like inside the minds of introverts, and showed introverts the advantages of their ways, and the power in their silence.
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting it to be a bad movie. It wasn't. The story could have been a little more complex and developed more. Overall, I felt like the movie and the acting didn't have as much depth as it could have. But All in all it was still a good movie with good performances from Travolta and DeNiro. If you like either of these actors and you like showdown mano a mano type movies then this is worth a watch.
B006UAWH2S|5.0|Great, heartbreaking movie. Very unique plot and ideas, and wonderful acting. This is one that will keep you thinking after the credits - my favorite kind of movie!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Love to watch it every year at Christmas just to hear Judy Garland's beautiful rendition of &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.&#34;
B004YRSBTW|4.0|Took a while to finally see this - very clever, but you have to pay close attention, wondering what parts matter, trying to remember who's who, and just feeling compassion and fear for this guy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this game for a while now and I love it! The unique powerups and combinations keep me playing. Although its kind of annoying when I run out of lives and have to wait for more. But I guess it's good if you are really addicted and you get a break rather than play all day non-stop. :)
B001NA6096|5.0|Love this intro to the best film trilogy ever. Yes, even better than Star Wars. And here's the amazing thing - I watched this a few months ago in preparation for Before Midnight, and was amazed by it's almost timeless quality. In an age of cellphones, computers and the internet, this film is still relevant because it's message is about love.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|Love the colors and the protection without the bulk. Price was good too. I spent $150 dollars replacing a cracked screen , don't want to repeat that again...looks like this case will help.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the best game and I love it !!!!!  I totally recommend it for anyone .  Younger kids will love it ,teens will love it , and adults who have kids will love it because it makes kids quiet
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Love this game, the graphics are beautiful, I like the music in the background and I REALLY love the hints. I don't like getting frustrated when playing a game. Highly recommend. I intend to buy more games from this developer, Fire Maple Games.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|better story than previous movies fills in the gaps. great costume. the modern technological effects make for a visually stunning movie.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is fun to play when bored.  Some emojis could be better, but overall it is good;)  fun and age appropriate too
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row.  I haveread most of his books and like them very much.  He is an excellent author.  Hope he will continue to publish more in the future.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Hasn't lost her touch. And a happy ending. What we all need! There's hope for everyone, great read for all
B00FATEJYE|5.0|THIS GAME ROCKS. I have been waiting for this,it's been on ios for  a while. So happy . 5 stars hands down
B004FRX0MY|1.0|its not on my device not sure if i dont know what im doing i dont know how to sync it i guess
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|It said i need to erase some of my memory to play the game because i had no memory on my device.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|So intelligently written, directed and acted. Can' t say enough about BC's performance. He was Tietjens! Watched it several times over.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Just started to use this but so far it is easy and effective.  It has a lot more options than the program that came with my camera... like it a lot so far.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I loved try is app!! Very helpful even in the free version! Don't know what i did without it!! Would recommend!!
B009CGR9S4|5.0|Great movie if you like the Hannible Lector movies. Plus some great cameos from the &#34;minor&#34; characters from the original movie who are part of the story.
B008JFUORW|3.0|Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it. I didn't get most of the hate about the second Hangover. It kept most of the winning formula of the first, where the guys try to piece together their night, aka you're likely to have a HANGOVER. It brought on a new story in the new country, and kept me entertained. But as usual, people complained because there were similarities to the first movie.<br /><br />So this time, there no longer was any kind of party. The series did a complete 180 and tried to be some kind of action adventure, which it is not. There were a few times I chuckled, but not from any under the influence antics that I came here for.
B004TI1WME|5.0|If you are going to have a calculator, you might as well have this one. It has an easy to maneuver interface that shows all of the recent calculations step by step
B009LA1QW6|5.0|The quality of the CD was excellent making the sound clearer to hear.  It was as if she were in the same room as me.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I thought I was interested in a list make but I guess I am not. I tried to use it, and what I saw was very easy to use
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am a little monster of Lady Gaga. Yeah!<br />Thank you Mother Monster, Lady Gaga.<br />Your a great singer to me. Yeah!
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Good action film built on humour and action. Willis and crew deliver an entertaining movie. Willis and Malkovich should team up again because they have the chemistry of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the Road series of films the latter pair did back in the forties and fifties. They really work well together and I hope somebody thinks of more to do with these two together. They were the heart of the film and it was greatly funny.
0307887960|3.0|I heard that Williams diet used it after they had baby George.  When I read it I felt it was like the Atkins diet.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put the book down. I am recommending this book for my book club selection soon.  Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|love the game but it shouldn't be so hard on certain levels. it just updated on android.... when is ours coming??
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This is a fat, gaudy, bloated comic-strip of a film. It offers no insight into Fitzgerald's characters or the story that Fitzgerald tells in the book. After about 20 minutes we turned it off. We couldn't take it any more.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Casting from phone or computer has become a cinch.<br />This is a great device to just shared with others.<br /><br />Hopefully Chromecast will be able to share anything on the computer in the future (5 stars), but from now only youtube and chrome tabs, hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />Would recommend anyone to buy this.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A good read. Lots of unexpected twists and turns. Now to watch the movie! And read the next book. Soon.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It was good over all a littel laggy at fist but good overall. If i had to choose it agine then i would
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a so awesome but there are things that need to be added<br />1.It needs more animals like puppys ghast osalots fish different kinds of Skelton<br />2.it needs to have the twightlight zone the under world mars<br />3.It needs more types of eggs<br />SO MOJAN PLEASE NOTE THESE TYES OF THINGS YOU NEED TO ADD YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUT I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU WOULD :)
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I LOVE it because it's like a puzzle. I love it because it makes you think.<br />Of ways to solve problems.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|great family movie!!  Good humor for all ages.  very clever and jokes that all family members can appreciate on different levels.
0739384171|5.0|My last physical AudioBook CD purchase (already 3+ years ago by the time of this review).. I moved on to Audible shortly thereafter. A great Amazon subsidiary, and a much better way to go. Instant downloads wherever you are.<br /><br />As for the story. it was excellent! Incredibly compelling, though dark and sprinkled with occasional violence, which I don't usually go for. I went through the whole trilogy in a few weeks! But the writing transcended the violence, and the young tech savvy female protagonist is so well drawn as a modern underdog who unintentionally evolves to heroic stature over the series. The forces arrayed against her, that is, the modern state, through it's medical/psychological & legal establishment, are fierce and relentless, as is their nature. A wonderful female David and Goliath tale.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'm sorry to say that I have read most of this series already.  I kept hoping it would get better - unfortunately, it did not.  It most definitely is geared toward a younger audience.  Also, Ms Rice should get her editors to do a much better job correcting grammar, spelling and sentence construction. Very very predictable and enough to make you retch.
B00190N4E4|5.0|Well done. Kinda long yet you don't even notice because you're enjoy the story line and history.. Seems to be a must watch on any movie list.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|I just downloaded this app.  It seems to be so far,  a  bit on the simple side.  Preschoolers may enjoy the colours and sounds.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing, thought-provoking, and entertaining.  This is certainly on my list of best-loved books.  I do not think i will watch the movie; there is simply no way it could capture the nuances of the story.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Awesome<br />The game is awesome Leo and Donny are my favorites it used to be $3.99 but now it's free people should buy it
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Strange goings on in a sleepy town!  I enjoyed this book a lot.  It took me a little while to get into it, but am really pleased that I persevered because it twisted and turned very well.  I have already downloaded the next two Rose Gardner Mysteries.  Does she stay with Joe, or whatever his name really is?  And what happened to Muffy?!  There has to be a better job for her than working in the DMV...
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I started out with the free version of this app, and bought the paid version soon after, when I saw how much my kids enjoyed it and how well done it is.<br />A lot of puzzles are included, and both my kids love puzzles and are very good at them, so this is perfect for them.<br />My kids are five and two, and both of them find the games engaging. I like that the game is well made, gives parental control over which games to turn off and on, and has very vibrant colors.<br />Also, as I said in my review of the free version of this app, it is great that the kids build two skills at the same time -- learning the alphabet, and spatial skills through the puzzles.<br />Definitely another winner from the devs at 22learn!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I got this when it was FAOTD. Fun, gently challenging, nice graphics. My only complaint would be that it is too short.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|What a wonderful and touching journey. The perspective of death in our lives was ver vividly portrayed. A tru masterpiece
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|My wife and I were extremely disappointed in this one--while the first hour actually had a storyline, the second hour is nothing more than extended battle and chase scenes that really added nothing to the story at all.  The way that Khan defeats the Klingons single-handedly is ridiculous, for example.  By the end, we were both glad it was over.  While a good chase scene or battle scene can work well in a movie, here they're just an excuse for the special effects.  The real film basically stops when they send Kirk after Khan--after that, we get a few scattered details about characters and background, but no real character or plot development.  And the way they drag out the Enterprise's almost-destruction is simply tedious.  All in all, I'm shocked to see so many five-star reviews of this over-produced, mediocre movie.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I just started this series and I'm hooked. Reacher is bad ass through and through. There's not single weakness about him.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This is a broke version of YouTube for the kindle.  It's so bad, we usually use the website rather than the app.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My girls love anything that has to do with One Direction. It was a hit with them and their friends.
B008Y7X3JG|5.0|A family classic that is funny but yet chalk full of teachable moments. Also I am so glad I am a vegetarian otherwise this would be hard to watch!
0062213423|5.0|My girls love anything that has to do with One Direction. It was a hit with them and their friends.
0743496736|4.0|got this for a girlfriend of mine, she said she liked it. she really like this author so idk how helpfull this review will be..
B004CRR9G0|5.0|THis is hands down one of the greatest animes ever. This was originally drawn and made entirely by Miyazaki. Love this Movie
B00C0ALZ0W|3.0|I have read a couple of books by Jason. I really like the writing style. Unfortunately there was nothing to learn here.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son LOVES this movie! We started watching it last year and we have probably watched it on DVR about a 100 times. Now it's time to get it on DVD for this year so he can watch it no matter what. Thank you! Love it!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I used this i5 processor in my PC I built in 2012. One year later, here is my review.<br /><br />So far this little devil still plows through everything I throw at it. windows 7/8.1 run flawlessly. In windows 7 at Idle would only run about 4-7% of the processor even searching through web or youtube on 1080p I would be usually less than 50%. The i5, is the perfect balance between cost, performance and efficiency for what most people would need to accomplish in a normal day to day setting. I have been able to run Crysis on this PC and with my 32 inch monitor, the processor does everything I could ask ad still has enough power for more.<br /><br />Pro : Powerful, efficient, great performance, heat output, comes with its own heat sync<br /><br />Con: slightly more costly than AMD
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Gives you the sense that, even if life isn't predetermined by physics... just knowing that there is a beginning and an end limits the possibilities.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is the best drawing app that I have used. There are so many things to choose from. There are stamps, color pencils, crayons, paint brushes, and markers. The cool thing about this app are the different backgrounds that you can choose from. Drawing pad is definitely worth your money.
B004GJYROG|1.0|I saw this in the theater when it first came out. I too was taken in by the hype and promise. I was hoping for another Roger Rabbit.<br />Boy was I disappointed.<br />Yes. Some of the animation was fluid and presentable, but it seriously came off as a \\" Let's hype the hell out of Michael Jordon and his shoes.\\"<br />I actually stayed through the whole film. Hoping, praying it would pull through at the last minute. But no.<br />Not since Water World have I complained to theater management wanting my two hours of life back cause it was so terrible. I got lucky and received two free passes to another movie, even the manager agreed with me.<br />Save your money. Save your soul. Don't' waste your time with this nightmare unless you want it for a bad movie collection.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Loved it!  Action packed with great cinematography!  This struck me as a believable forecast of the future of big cities!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Good read / Kindle version works great on laptop / Amazon has free Kindle for PC - easy to DL at their site and easy to get books from their book store/
B004G6009U|5.0|One of my favorite and a family favorite!This has to be one of the cutest movies I have ever seen and my little guy loves watching it with me!
0762451319|5.0|So much more that what I expected, I bought it because of the fake tatts but I got more, the magnets are so cool, the mini book is so cute and the necklace is lovely I have it in my neck since this arrived!
0694003611|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old and have makes me read this to him every night before bed! We both love this book! I would recommend Goodnight Moon to anyone!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The ending of this movie is pretty implausible, even for a zombie love story, but I somehow found myself smiling anyway.  This would be a great date movie.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Creepy and riveting, this film grabbed me from the first scene and squeezed me more tightly as it moved along.  This is one of the the most intensely scary movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />If you're looking for answers, pass this by.  If you're looking for blood and guts, look elsewhere.  This film will grab your imagination and whipsaw your emotions into very dark places.  Too intense for some people . . .
B006C1DH92|4.0|This game is great! One thing that maybe you can improve on is making this more challenging, better. I love both modes, and my friends have a ton of fun with it too! Great app!
B0013F1D02|5.0|Second to the last sword fight beats anything in Princess Bride. Wonderfully restrained performance by DeNiro. Michelle Peiffer was wonderfully over the top. Everyone gave a stunning performance, even Claire Dane (whom I usually don't care for much.) Funny, sweet, scary enough for children and tantalizing enough for adults. Really, I prefer Captain Shakespeare to the Dread Pirate Roberts any day. Just when you think you know what is going to work, it doesn't. Yes, it is a new fairy tale with the fairy tale ending but, oh, what a fairy tale! Artwork that is beautiful and mundane at one, rusted and gilded, twisted and true as an arrow. Enjoy!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I chose this book because I have read the other book. Thanks full of superseded and romance I would read it if I where you.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I first saw this when I was twelve and I inhaled the book. After 46 years and numerous documentaries on reintroducing animals to the wild and the Christian the Lion videos, I decided to revisit this, my introduction to wild cats. And forty six years and all those documentaries haven't diminished its impact - I still found myself well up with tears as the credits rolled. The real George Adamson can be found on the Christian the Lion videos on YouTube but you don't really watch this for George - you watch it for Joy (played by Virginia McKenna) and Elsa (and yes, I know the cat in this movie was NOT Elsa but Henrietta but that doesn't matter.) Thus - as the true life of the wild Elsa doesn't diminish the impact of this film - thanks to the Adamsons and their books, the idea of caging big cats became recognized as the cruelty is was and habitat zoos replaced most zoos around the world and sanctuaries for retired pet and circus cats and reintroduction programs for 'excess' captive bred lions were successful. But that sight of the once pet lion and her mate and cubs recumbent on a boulder still makes me cry. I want to share it with every youngster in my family and yours.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|some of the features are werid and hard to use like the comb. you also have to pretty much buy everything on the game. fix this and ur game could be better 6677g Itd.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I play the small grids in my phone and the big ones in my tablet and the game is beautiful. The Logic may get repetitive after a while but keep improving the algorithm to come up with grids!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|So this book starts with a fun, imaginable aspect which you long to have unfold in ribbons of glory... but the author falls short for me. The book felt rushed and uneducated. The book posses a great story, poorly written.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Have enjoyed playing this hidden object game.  Would like to have more friends in the game. Hours of playing time to be had.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this app my friend showed it to me best game ever cant stop playing it my friends love it I recommend it a lot.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I've always loved this movie!  And Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner make a great pair in this movie!  The music as well is awesome.
B00E9A656K|4.0|So some of y'all already played this game right. Ok know I want you to till your own friends so they can play this game.SO I SAY LOVE THIS GAME!
B002VECM4A|4.0|This shows a deep problem known all to well with families that try to cover up the secrets in their homes!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I, at almost 70, enjoyed reading it to my 10 and 13 year old grandsons.  They described it as awesome.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|well its great and all but it takes a lot of time to load at first and u can't find friends only if u play the in with them I know its saftey but really y'all can do better Cu's y'all have a lot of goods games! sooo ehhh not that good.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is a must see especially for those of us who live inside the beltway in Washington, DC.  Looking forward to Season 2.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Too many phoned in performances.  Willis was at his worst.  I'm a Willis fan but there comes a time to stop.  Otherwise a terrible remake of a fun first movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|What can I say that everyone else hasn't said.  Hooks you from the pilot and never, ever jumps the shark through the entire season.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|Will be watching this many times. BBC Cardiff has turned out some wonderful work the past couple years. Both Day Of The Doctor, and An Adventure in Space and Time are musts for any Dr. Who fan. One hint. Have some tissue handy for the last couple scenes of An Adventure in Space and Time.<br />An Adventure in Space and Time might be one of the best period works ever. In addition to flawless sets, Cardiff resisted the temptation to give 60s characters modern morals. Anything more would be &#34;spoilers&#34;, but it's a step back in time, for the watching.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|LOVED THIS ALBUM... SAW ALAN ON THE LETTERMAN SHOW SINGING &#34;BLACK TOP&#34; FROM THIS ALBUM AND ORDERED IT THAT NIGHT.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Very fun and entertaining game. Great graphics and my 7 yr old even enjoys it. Keeps you coming back . Thanks to Zynga for another fantastic game experience. Definitely worth downloading! Great game!
630542845X|5.0|An incredible epic of an extremely sensitive and gifted young man. A classic case of Mans Inhumanity to Man !!!  Due to his differences which they don't even try to grasp, they fear (hate) him and he becomes subject to constant torment. He remains loyal to his upbringing handling adversity with compassion.
0307949486|5.0|It came fast and it was in good condition, and it was a good read.  I would recommend it to others.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best. Book. Ever. I'm so sad and so happy right now...just...ugh. Thank you John Green. Thank you very much. Ugh
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Not bad. Just a long loading screen between tasks. Every task. Slows the flow of the game. Kills the fun. Galaxy Note 2.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I feel it is a fabulous game. I love playing...challenging. Certainly enjoy the different levels...makes it never boring. Lots of friends play also do that's a real plus.
B003F48E4W|5.0|It's a gift so I got what he wanted.  It's hard to judge something I won't see.  You should have a different system for Christmas.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great game.  Very relaxing and entertaining.  I play this all the time and don't have any issues.  Great app to have.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|Shah Ruck does very well in this movie as an autistic person. Kajol is also up to par. Great performance and great story.
0062255657|5.0|I've been a Neil Gaiman fan since I first Read his collaboration with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, the Nice & Accurate Prophecys of Agnes Nutter, Witch. Everything I've ever read by him is first quality. I dont think Neil is capable of boreing mundane writing. This is Likely for a juvenile but I'm 70 & I loved the book. I would reccomend it to any age.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|Don't like the script, don't like the story and don't like the actor. Sorry Poor direction and poor story. No impressive at all.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Almost perfect movie with top notch casting in the two lead roles as well as the great Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. The rest of the cast is a little spotty but probably the worst in the film is January Jones as The White Queen. She's pretty, yes, but so is a LOT of other talented actresses that could have been much better in this film. The icing on the cake goes to Fassbender, for his heartbreaking portrayal of Magneto. Probably the first time a director has been able to truly show the reasoning behind his motives.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So interesting that you could not put the book down.  Could not wait to read the next book and next and next.  Waiting for the next book.  I guess it's coming the summer of 2015, which is a very long wait.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss<br /><br />“Salt Sugar Fat” is a fascinating expose of the tactics used by the process food industry to seduce us into buying their products.  The focus of this eye-opening book is on the leading roles that salt, sugar and fat has in the food industry and their link to an obesity epidemic.  Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter at the New York Times, Michael Moss provides the public with a real &#34;treat&#34;.  This top-notch researched 481-page book includes fourteen chapters and is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Sugar, 2. Fat, and 3. Salt.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. As well researched a book as you will find.  Well written and accessible.<br />2. A fascinating and eye-opening topic.  The tactics of the process food industry, an expose.<br />3. Moss captures comprehensively the lengths to which food companies will go in order to shield their operations from the public view.  Many examples throughout the book.  &#34;Yet many of the biggest slaughterhouses would sell their meat only to hamburger makers like Cargill if they agreed not to test their meat for E. coli until it was mixed together with shipments from other slaughterhouses. This insulated the slaughterhouses from costly recalls when the pathogen was found in ground beef, but it also prevented government officials and the public from tracing the E. coli back to its source.&#34;<br />4. The food industry's eye-opening pursuit of allure.  The sophistication, the science behind it all.  &#34;They’ve discovered that the brain lights up for sugar the same way it does for cocaine, and this knowledge is useful, not only in formulating foods. The world’s biggest ice cream maker, Unilever, for instance, parlayed its brain research into a brilliant marketing campaign that sells the eating of ice cream as a “scientifically proven” way to make ourselves happy.&#34;<br />5. Why sugar is irresistible to us.  &#34;In truth, the entire mouth goes crazy for sugar, including the upper reaches known as the palate. There are special receptors for sweetness in every one of the mouth’s ten thousand taste buds, and they are all hooked up, one way or another, to the parts of the brain known as the pleasure zones, where we get rewarded for stoking our bodies with energy.&#34;<br />6. Many informative facts throughout the book. &#34;On average, we consume 71 pounds of caloric sweeteners each year. That’s 22 teaspoons of sugar, per person, per day. The amount is almost equally split three ways, with the sugar derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and the group of corn sweeteners that includes high-fructose corn syrup (with a little honey and syrup thrown into the mix).&#34;<br />7. Kids and their love affair with sugar.  &#34;This much is clear from the research at Monell: People love sugar, especially kids. And up to a certain point—the bliss point—the more sugar there is, the better.&#34;<br />8. The link between sugar and obesity.  &#34;The overconsumption of sugar in solid foods or drinks has increasingly been tied to the obesity epidemic, which has only grown more dire. Overeating is now a global issue.&#34;<br />9. Revelations from consumer scientists. &#34;Supermarket real estate is so precious, in fact, that consumer scientists have conducted experiments in which they place devices on the heads of shoppers to track their eye movements as they roam the store, and the gleanings from these studies has helped define the pecking order on the shelf.&#34;<br />10. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is following the rise of some of the most popular food products.<br />11. Keen observations that led to multi-million or even multi-billion dollar products.  &#34;The data showed that people had varied preferences for coffee that could be grouped into three different roasts, weak, medium, and strong. Each roast was considered equally perfect by their respective fans. This was a novel concept at the time. The American consumer was viewed as a singular target, uncomplicated by variation, and every food company making every grocery product was focused on finding the one perfect formulation. Moskowitz, in a bold stroke, convinced General Foods that it should be selling not one but all three of these roasts—a breakthrough that the executive in charge of fixing Maxwell House at the time, John Ruff, told me saved the brand.&#34;<br />12. The importance of convenience.  &#34;But the sky was their limit, he said, and there were only a few constraints that he would place on them. These foods had to be easy to buy, store, open, prepare, and eat.&#34;<br />13. A lot of fascinating history here.  &#34;The second move by the industry was perhaps the most influential of all. To compete with the home-cooking skills being taught by Betty Dickson and the other home economics teachers, the industry wielded its very own Betty to preach the creed of convenience. Her name was Betty Crocker, and she quickly became one of the most famous women in America, notwithstanding the fact that she was entirely fake.&#34;<br />14. Marketing.  The key behind Coca-Cola.<br />15. The role of cheese. &#34;The soaring amounts of cheese we eat is no accident. It is the direct result of concerted efforts by the processed food industry, which has labored long and hard to transform the very essence of cheese and its role in our diet.&#34;<br />16. There are many interesting storylines behind some of the most financially rewarding products including Lunchables.  &#34;The Lunchables, however, used the regular products and were already a superstar in the Oscar Mayer lineup. It had gone from being a money loser—or, as Eckert put it, “a bleeder”—to being “a growth engine,” a foundation of the company’s profits. “We’re leading the hottest segment of the supermarket’s refrigerated case,” he said. That year, the Lunchables hit a string of milestones: 100 million pounds in trays sold, half a billion dollars in revenue earned, and $36 million in profits.&#34;<br />17. The role of the government.  The battle between the lobbyists and the Dept of Agriculture.  &#34;Inside the Department of Agriculture, where the public is less welcome, the agency pursues an agenda that is every bit as massive as the buildings themselves: Overseeing the food that Americans eat. Its principal mission is to ensure the integrity of the country’s most fundamental life-giving force, from farm to fork.&#34;<br />18. Interesting storylines regarding the main quest of making money versus health risks. &#34;To be sure, in these early days of handling fat, Philip Morris viewed the public’s worries as entirely manageable. It merely had to deploy a strategy, used by the entire consumer goods industry, known as the line extension: When people clamor loudly enough for healthier products, enough so that they are willing to sacrifice some of the pleasure these products provided, companies produce a better-for-you formulation.&#34;<br />19. The power of salt. &#34;The power of salt in food is smartly summed up by the industry’s largest supplier of salt, Cargill, which says in its sales literature: People love salt. Among the basic tastes—sweet, sour, bitter and salty—salt is one of the hardest ones to live without. And it’s no wonder. Salt, or sodium chloride, helps give foods their taste appeal—in everything from bacon, pizza, cheese and French fries to pickles, salad dressings, snack foods and baked goods. People don’t just love salt, they crave salty foods.&#34;<br />20. Chips! &#34;As long as the chips remain alluring—through their fat, their crunch, their salty flavor from salt substitutes—and the marketing campaigns give you psychological permission to eat as many as you like, they will continue to deliver calories. And that, after all, is the ultimate cause of obesity.&#34;<br />21. What we can do to combat obesity.  &#34; This notion of seizing control in order to ward off an unhealthy dependence on processed food may be the best recourse we have in the short term. Consumer advocates are pushing the government to compel the food industry to undertake a wide range of changes in their formulations and marketing, including large reductions in their loads of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, restrictions on what foods can be sold through school vending machines, and redesigns of labels to make their nutritional information easier to read. But if the government or industry resists, these changes could take many years. In the meantime, only we can save us.&#34;<br />22. An excellent epilogue, great supporting material including notes and bibliography.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. About a hundred pages too long.  Well written but too many unnecessary details that at times bogs the book down.  It does require an investment of your time.<br />2. A summary table of the main players/companies and their products would have been helpful.<br />3. The book does a much better job of exposing the food industry than providing specific guidelines on what the public can do. It's not that Moss doesn't provide some suggestions including revealing how Finland helped its citizens lower consumption in salt but it's very little in comparison.<br /><br />In summary, the insights into the process food industry alone makes this book worthy of five stars.  The research of this book is top notch and Moss makes many eye-opening revelations that are troublesome.  It's amazing how little the general public knows about what is going on behind the scenes in the process food industry.  This book will go a long way toward creating awareness and hopefully inspire leaders to do something about it.  The book does require an investment of time and focuses more on the societal ills caused by the big three than the cure but it's such an important topic that it's must read material.  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: &#34;The End of Overeating&#34; by David Kessler, &#34;Mindless Eating&#34; by Brian Wansink, &#34;Fat Chance&#34; by Robert H.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this book because I haven't read it. I would think you would want a better review than what your making me type at this moment? Haha
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I feel exclamation points in this review would be pointless. As I finished this story and stared blankly at my bedroom wall, I was not thinking in exclamation points. Only in colors. In beautiful colors and in utter awe at what I had just read. Told from the point of view of Death, this story reads like nothing else I have experienced.<br />The story of a  little German girl named Liesel, lovingly called the Book Thief by one of her closest friends, is a tale full of unimaginable sorrow. And wisdom. And fear, mischief, determination, love, anger, more love, and hope. Especially hope. Stick with her to the end, and I promise you won't be disappointed.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|It was a presant for my husband! It was so hard to wait for his birthday! It is just what I hoped it would be and it came quickly and safe.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun and simple great time burner just as fun as any other bubble game out there. If I could give it a higher rating than five stars I definitely would two thumbs up.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Very good book. In terms of ideas, it`s clear and makes a compelling point. The historical comparisons are very enlightening. However, in terms of language, it tends to be very repetitive. Also, I think some historical accounts might be oversimplified. Case in point: The author speaks of Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire and refers to its various companies as monopolistic and having a tight grip on the market. Now, I'm Mexican, and it is true that Slim's companies are everywhere, are very big and very influential. But, and this is important, they don't suck. Let me elaborate. Telmex, the originally state owned telephony company, when it was operated by the government was one of the worst companies to ever served this country, service was awful, expensive, full of line cuts and interference, with long waiting times for service. Fast forward to the 2000 some years after being operated by Slim. The company still controls most of the market, but service is very good, you almost never experience failures of any kind,  and they have a variety of useful complementary services to their main offer. It's still expensive though. My point is that the author tries to give the impression of Slim shoving its products down the country's throat wether we like it or no, when in fact, his companies present a reasonable offer and nobody forces you to buy from him, other options being available.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|The rare album that has no filler - all songs are excellent, from the catchy opening track to the outstanding &#34;Gang of Rhythm&#34; (check it on youtube). These are great songs for running.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Everyone should read this book and become familiar with the ideas therein.

1856697061|5.0|this is couture...fashion to be amazed with.  Knowing how to produce these unique features is wonderful.  Some I can envision toned down a bit for a special outfit.  These magical creations get the imagination in high gear.  LOVE knowing how to recreate even if in a more modest manner.
B001ANSS5K|2.0|I read this after reading (and loving) The Fault in Our Stars, but was disappointed. Like all of John Green's books, it was beautifully written, but that is all I can say in its defense. It's hard to discuss why I disliked it without giving anything away. The main character is a selfish, angsty teenager and I had a hard time feeling anything but annoyance at her actions.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I have been using and recommending SwiftKey for a couple years now. That all changed today with the 4.3 update. They removed one simple feature, the key height. I noticed my keys were small on my screen after the upgrade. Luckily I had a backup so I can run the old version but it cuts me off from any future updates.<br /><br />Please put this feature back!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written. A book about cancer, without being a book about cancer. I honestly couldn't put it down. Absolutely recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play and it gives you lots of lives to be able to play unlike other games.  Challenging also.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This was a very good book about one mans journey for redemption and understanding. Definitely a page turner. You discover very quickly that Harold is far more than he seems as his past comes into the light.  The people he meets and the ones he left behind help him come to grips with that past. Moving and insightful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was phenomenal! Could not put it down! It was sexy and raw. Can't wait to see what happens next!
B008B7OQHM|5.0|Slipknot,I've been listening to Slipknot and going deeper into everything what they mean. They're not Satanic what some religious people say,but it's just how they can let all the hate out and trying to let their fans free with all that stress. The fans get to understand that too and every concert of Slipknot has a meaning and in every kind of crazy type of sound they make is the true personality they have. Families they have too and so do their fans. Slipknot has inspired me since the beginning. And I love them very much! \m/!!!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved this story. Love everything about this book!! Drew you sexy beast! I  wanted this book to go on forever!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django Unchained in my humble opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino movie he has ever dreamed up, and there have been some great ones in the past.  This movie features Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and a great performance by Samuel L. Jackson.  The movie is deceptive from what you see from the trailers.  Django Unchained looks like your run of the mill revenge film, which it is, but its more.  This movie is also about friendship (Foxx and Wentz) and lost love (Foxx and Washington).<br /><br />The movie features an outstanding soundtrack and the literary language used in the film is perfect.  The supporting cast is great as well, which is to be expected from a Tarantino movie.  I actually paused this review to watch a little of the movie while writing this review, this is how much I like the movie.  I think you will love this movie and I would definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun to play even for my 4 yr old. she loves taking care of her horse. her favorite part  especially taking pictures. she really wants a zebra :/
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a great movie that I knew nothing about before I saw it.  I remembered watching this movie and saying to myself wow this movie is great how was this not a bigger hit.  The movie is based on the Fox TV show, Firefly (which is equally great).  Serenity comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, who is the mastermind behind Marvels \\"The Avengers\\", Dollhouse, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The movie features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.  The movie has a great cast and writing is also great, which is to be expected from a Joss Whedon movie.  The visual effect are first class and the movie in my opinion is great from beginning to end.  Once you see this movie will be a big fan and it will make you want to watch all of Joss's other projects.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
1419705849|5.0|If you enjoy the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and movies then you need to have this book in your collection. The trend of funny and entertainment continues strongly through this book. I am amazed at how high a level Jeff Kinney has kept up the book series is still at seven books in. If you have not read these books then I highly suggest starting from the beginning. These books are aimed at kids, but are highly entertaining and a quick and never stop being a good reread.
B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men: First Class is a great movie that you will find yourself watching over and over again.  This movie was directed Matthew Vaughn who directed Kick-Ass and Layer Cake (good movie you should also check out).  This movie features James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, and Jennifer Lawrence.  The movie is set in the 1970's and shows the start of the Professor X's X-Men.  The movie has heart and is has a great cast that showcase some great acting chops.  The bad boys are tough and menacing unlike some weaker superhero movies.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game itself is enjoyable, and I would have no problem continuing to play it if it did not have such intrusive adds.  They cover the entire screen and cause accidental clicks often.  I have no problem with a banner here or there, but these are ridiculous.  I am deleting this because of the adds and sticking to one of the many other coin pusher apps with less obnoxious adds.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first work of the smart, yet sensitive John Green's that I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a huge critic when it comes to reviewing media (well, I try not to be), although I feel that I have quite a fair amount of room to comment on this lovely philosophical romantic that I nourished my story-hungry mind with this past weekend. Hey, if the mods of the Amazon Kindle Store will let any old coot say, \\"This book rocks harder than Dwayne Johnson!!\\", then why can't I? :P<br /><br />Still, if I had to reveal any sort of internal criticism toward this book, it would be rendered toward the fact that Hazel and I would have a few disagreements on beliefs regarding human nature and divine appointments. I understand that this is only a fictional story (and a grand one, at that), but sometimes I feel for the characters more than I should, whether those feelings be positive or negative. I guess this is more of a criticism towards her and not towards the story itself, in which case, excuse me for my excessive bantering. (I did say I wasn't much of a critic)<br /><br />Regardless of whatever other stabs I've taken from it, \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" is a prime example of why we should be more aware of the outward, not just inward, damages cancer can cause. That and thankfulness plays a huge role in cherishing whatever life we live, so ignoring it would cause bitterness and a negative perspective on life. You wouldn't want that, would you? Happy reading, fellow bookworms!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really great book. It took me a while to get in the story. But then I couldn't put it down. Really great reading!!!!!

B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|This first major label release is as good as the first two releases by Gregory Porter. He has joined a short list of artist whose music I buy without needing to hear the CD first (e.g., Kem, Diana Krall, Jill Scott). Even on the few songs not written or co-written by him, Gregory puts his own spin on the track making songs you new and inspired. I look forward to listening to Gregory Porter for decades to come.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing book !!!!!!!!<br />It was really touching and described beautifully as though someone was telling me the story.<br />You must get this book!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. Grisham at his finest. Was sorry the book ended and wanted more.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Patricia does it again! Another page turner that really focuses on Kay and Benton's relationship as they navigate through a series of serial murders. My only disappointment was that the true killer was kinda snuck in at the end and there was very little character development of him. Otherwise A+!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I used to love this app. It's not very challenging which was somewhat disappointing but it's great for passing time. With that said... with this last update all of my paid and downloaded puzzles disappeared. The new &quot;restore paid puzzles&quot; button is great if it actually worked which it doesn't. It tries to load and then says the web page does not exist. Since I paid for the ad free version I expect it to work like it's supposed to. If they fix the problems I would likely give it at least 4 stars
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very addictive game. So glad it finally came to kindle. Love the game. Would recommend to all of my gaming friends.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|This is not a get rich quick book.  It is more about planning a life that will get you rich the slow and sure way.  Most people learn their financial values from people who have not been financially successful.  This book will help you develop a financial plan for your life that is going to work.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Really good horror movie! I screamed and jumped and... well, enjoyed it very very much! I am planning on visiting some sites in CT just because of this movie.
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|I am sure this will work for some people but it is very protein heavy.  I was unable to stomach this diet.  There is just a limit to how much meat I can eat.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Sad Sad movie. The worst thing is the Crystal Skull, who really cares about an Alien Crystal Skull? The Sankara Stones, the lost ark, the chalice.... those are all ¨Macguffins¨that relate to a notion of community or culture... therefore you participate with it, but the crystal skull? It's hardly possible to relate to that... not even Indiana seems to give a damn about it.<br /><br />And the giant ants... pleaaaase.... Utterly dissapointed.
B000002MUQ|4.0|Not Van Halen's best work but to a fan an essential part of the collection.  Weird cover art.  To a Van Halen fan an essential part of the collection.
B00G70WLJA|2.0|Average, boring.... really not interesting. If you liked Thor you might like this? I mean it is fun, but really uninteresting... As bad or worse than the previous Wolverine movie.
B000002LPD|5.0|I love Eddy Van Halen's guitar work.  This is a classic album.  For a Van Halen fan this is a must have album.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Usually the weather forecast is 70% right, or near correct.  We enjoy opening the app to see what it says for the current, for tonight and tomorrow.  We do appreciate the weather alerts.<br /><br />The 'current temperatures' are frequently off, but it is probably due to our rural location in the Oregon Coast range (lack of reporting).  We look outside to be sure.  We love TWC  on television.
0316017922|4.0|This book is a really good reminder that hard work can pay dividends.  Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice.  You don't have to be porn in the top few precent of IQ to achieve at the top of your field.  Anyone in the top 25% can make it to the top with training and practice.  Even the people the average person can have considerable success with training and practice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger Games is one of my favourite book series ever. I could recommend this til I'm blue in the face.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, fun game to do in my spare time.. was grateful it was free, I was happy the app was free, thank you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome and really cool!!!  You should really really really get this app. It is fun and makes time fly.
0307271080|4.0|Americanah,’ by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie  2013  475pg<br />Realities of race, this is the 3rd novel of the author<br />An Americanah is a Nigerian that has lived in the States long enough and when they return to Nigeria are different from the locals.  From this book we learn about ex-pat Africans in the States as well as life in Nigeria.<br />Terrific novel and as I lived half my life in South Africa was able to appreciate this up to date story.
0670024856|5.0|Absolutely fascinating ! Would be interesting for both women & men. A novel yet historically correct. Excellent. Take your time and enjoy this book.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great movie in the new series of Star Trek. I believe that both Trekkies & &#34;normal&#34; folks with like it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is James Bond-Daniel Craig & Judi Dench. No more words necessary. Fascinating story line and villain most complex and interesting. Did not expect the ending...
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Absolutely wonderful and heart wrenching as this is a true story.  Reminds me of our North American Indian residential schools
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great read and it kept me activated to the last page.  A beautiful love story which still holds true to reality.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Another great Flow game. I lose track of time playing this and the price is just right. it keeps my brain happy.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love love love these headphones.  I think the sound quality is amazing and they're comfortable.  I just wish they were a bit hardier as this is my 4th pair in several years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|dope game for the toilet, meetings, and when nothing else is happening.  Not sure what I would do in the WC before this game.........stare into space???
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I gave it a five star rating because it was entertaining and well written. The words flow easily and the suspense is fast paced. The story does not drag at all.
B00G21YLF6|4.0|Good but missing Amy and Rory. Really dissapointed they couldn't get them in the episode. Not only that but the episode is lackluster compared to the first two Matt Smith seasons which were very well written. But this episode is better than the Clara episodes and would be worth seeing.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Loved this movie...! Heath Ledger's performance complimented Christian Bale's Batman! I purchased this movie for my grandson, who is an extreme Batman fan!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this so much me and my friend got it and  we are so hooked! I love making giant castles and I would recommend this app to everyone. I love playing online with my friends. So obsessive!!!!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like the storylines and the travel from land to land.  You have challenge of the match three and the progression through a map.  Extremely entertaining.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|fun, easy, and cool. the best boxing game in the world this year. all robots are able to be designed by you and I would save money and go big on your robot
1401923119|5.0|This book is a life changer.  And in my personal opinion, a life saver.  It changes everything about what we've been told about hereditary diseases and frees you from them.
0553583182|3.0|This book points out the obvious to us.  If you have a positive attitude, this just reinforces it.  It is kind of slow reading and not that interesting.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great story lines, great acting. We have enjoyed this series right from the start and it just keeps getting better.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I just felt like it spent the entire movie building up for the sequel.  Maybe take a page out of Star Wars and start halfway through the saga.  It was a bit boring and left too many questions at the end.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is one of the best apps I ever just played just takes a while for power cores to recharge.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie is OK but I have no desire to watch it again.  It is supposed to be thought provoking but it falls short of that mark.
0307120007|5.0|Good book to read to children unable to speak or barely able to. Pointing to the pictures, getting child to pat the bunny, and reading along establishes a comfortable ritual for children. This positive experience with books and reading can then be built on with more advanced books.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was incredible.  I can't believe that it didn't do better in the box office -- I don't know maybe it did.  This is definitely worth watching.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use. Large format is easy to read. Great for simple calculations.  And it's free. That's an unbeatable combination.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Love all the pendergast books. Really starting to get attached to each of the characters. One can only imagine what the next story will entail!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My Boys love to watch all three and this makes it easy for them to chose the movie they want. I haven't check out the extras as my boys aren't interested in the extras so I haven't reviewed them. However if you are looking to collect all three movies these are good. I would like to note that the movies don't start automatically so you do have to start them manually.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. It grabbed me with the first line, and kept me until the last one. I don't want to give anything away with the ending so I'll comment on the rest of the book. I loved the character development. I loved the premise that was so smartly written and researched. It flows so smoothly. I would read other books this author has written. I highly recommend this one. It might seem that the subject matter is depressing, but it's not. There are funny moments. There are heart wrenching ones. All of it beautifully orchestrated.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Love Fracine's books she makes me want to throw all of my extra stuff (toiletries, etc.) away immediately but also living on a tight budget I realize I need to use these items and let them dwindle down over time so as not to waste money. But I am not allowing myself to buy anything else till they are gone no matter how tempting. I did get rid of all of the extra dishes and such my boyfriend had when I moved in which is great because it motivates me to do the dishes immediately. I highly recommend this book to motivate you into living a less stressful life.
B00FRKPC9C|5.0|I love this book.  It is an annual read for me.  Every year I get new insights into the story and its characters.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King has almost become a friend from reading his books for over 40 years.  I laugh, cry, and yell at him and his books while reading them.  His bad guys, or gals in this case, are so bad that you can't wait for the good guys to take them out.  The depiction of death and redemption in this book is a model for everyone to live by.  That is one of the great things about reading Stephen King;  he makes one look into their inner soul and question yourself about life, charity, loyalty and goodness.  He knows there is terrible evil out there but Stephen King combats bad with good.  Oh if only our world worked that way but it is so nice to go into Mr. King's world and dream of the &#34;shoulds&#34;.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|Cheesy ending ruined it.  Unlike others, only the laptop computer was recording that the family was aware of, all the rest of the camera angles appear to be video cameras, but it's obvious that no one in the family set them up because they never reviewed the footage.  Lame.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Wow, what a great story.  A very imaginative concept for a story.  Adults can enjoy it as much as children.  I have watched this many times and find it lightens my spirit.  A great film by Pixar and the crew.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I AM DEFINITELY AN NCIS FAN AND COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO DUCKY WHEN HE COLLAPSED ON THE BEACH.DVDS WERE IN PERFECT CONDITION.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|Although this was a good Pixar film, it wasn't the best.  The theme is good, but people are not yet a great staple in technology yet.  If you see it as a cartoon, then it is fun and kids can relate to it.  It doesn't have the story down for adults like other Pixar films that goes across various ages of viewers.
1401324649|4.0|An excellent read. However at 400 pages it did sort of drag to conclusion with the last 50 pages. The exploits of 100 year old Allen Karlson somewhat crazy to not get several laughs per page in many places. I would read another from Jonas Jonasson in the future. 4 stars out of 5 (a bit too long) A great read not to miss !!
B001BKG9SK|3.0|It is ok, but just having the music was enough.  The movie was not impressive.  I like David's songs, even at my age, but buying this DVD was a mistake for me.
B00006JIA4|5.0|If you're a Queen fan, this is a great CD collection to have.  I've put away the turntable so I've been replacing albums with CD's.  This is a great one.
B00275EHJG|4.0|As most of the Pixar sequels this is another good one.  It carries the story of the first Toy Story to a &#34;Trilogy&#34; level with this third version.  Thanks to many great animators and very creative individuals this is one that can be passed on to the next generation before it will be eclipsed by newer technology - a great buy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a fabulously touching, heartwarming, cheerful and deeply moving line up of characters and their story. As a committed lover of books, words and people, I couldn't put it down. Mr. Zusak has a masterful command of the English language. He also gently expanded my minuscule knowledge of my German ancestors' mother tongue. For those of us that are WWII story buffs, this incredible story came close to hundreds of others, not just in Germany, but in towns and villages all over war torn Europe. A superb must read!! Now, on to the movie!!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This was one of the great Pixar classic films.  Had a imaginative concept and though at times predictable, since kept me enjoying 90%+ of the film.  I have watched it many times and glad I purchased it.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|I just updated feedly on my kindle fire, and i'm finding the same problems here as on my phone. It takes mashing the back button to close, and it will often skip, showing an already scrolled through page twice.  I'm getting ready to delete it from both devices.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Prism is an appropriate title for this album.  There's a range of songs on here from bright, fun, and cheery, to dark and complex ones.  It's rare for me to like a whole entire album, so I am happy to say that this one's in that category.  Well done, Katy Perry!  Just be forewarned - you won't be able to get these songs out of your head!
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Great movie, perfect comic book-come-alive visuals and quirky love story. Great cast and the plot wasn't so simple that you could always guess what would happen next, which happens all too often.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|I hate to say that I hate this album - but I do.  I AM a Lady Gaga fan!  I have all of her other albums and usually love at least 75% of the songs on each of them.  Unfortunately, I can't stand to listen to more than 30 seconds of any of these songs before I'm ready to skip on to something else on my playlist.  She sounds like either a hooker, a serial killer, or a self absorbed witch on most of the tracks.  Don't waste your money.
B007PFD90G|5.0|I usually don't read memoirs but I am glad I read this one. This is by far one of the best books published recently. I highly recommend it.
B00B2QG3K2|1.0|I've been listening to Paramore since they were unknowns years ago. Paramore has always been one of the bands where I can literally listen to every single song and like it. The amazingly artistic instrumentals as well as amazing voice from Hayley is what sold me on this product. Their second album, brand new Eyes, was just as good as the first album. There are a couple of songs I would skip, but 8/10 of the songs are superb. They outdid themselves and lived up to the hype.<br /><br />This album however, does not suit my style at all. I find myself skipping almost every song on the list. About 2/10 of the songs I can bare continue listening to. Hayley still has the voice, but something has changed in the instrumentals and music. It's not as catchy. The style does not fit Paramore. They are moving towards a new direction for some reason and I don't like it. I would not recommend this album. Hopefully the next album they can produce the same music that made me love them.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I so wish this girl was nicer when I see her on TV, it absolutely kills me but I love her music
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use the alarm clock to remind me of important things I have for the day..easy to set and change..love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minions. do I really need to say more. They rock. they collect bananas and dodge bombs. Its awesome for me and my kids.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Great story....just told all thorough individual's thoughts. Slow read, not a lot of action until the end. Wasn't sure I would finish it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|1. I use it daily, fits with most outfits, not too casual not too fancy<br />2. The feel, weight and look says it's a quality watch<br />3. The fabric strap is what I prefer since it actually breathes opposed to a form of plastic, or metal<br />4. The backplate window is fun to show off, gives me a steampunk feel, wish the front was also seethrough, that'd make my day!<br />5. The time every once in a while will be off by a bit or by a lot (happened only once) since it's a mechanical watch and I didn't wear it for multiple days in a row, assuming it just ran out of &#34;juice&#34;
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlen Coben writes a really, really, good story. The characters are well written and they drive the story. Coben's book usually capture my attention right from the beginning and hold it until the end. Gone for Good was no exception. I think My. Coben's The Woods was really his best book to date. Gone for Good came in as a close second.
B00D7HXSVQ|5.0|This book is awesome! It has some delicious recipes and I can't wait to try them all out. The best recipe is the Madras Fish Curry (also the author's favorite).
B001F4UHFI|4.0|Great movie with a lot of unfortunate truth. Well acted and very believable. Love the setting and plot of the movie.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|the controls are easy and the mechanic are easy to pick up I liked it. there is a bunch of guns so you and either be a redneck or a cityfolk hunter.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Why do I have to have a internet connection to play the game. That's freakin stupid. But that's gameloft for you. Shame on you gameloft for making me have to have a internet connection to play the game.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This camera app definitely serves it's purpose! I use it all the time and it gives fantastic pictures and videos...
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game is fun,challeging. Beginning, I had no clue as to what yo do.. Muddling ahead I found out (for example, what was &#34;jelly&#34; that I was to get rid of?). Eventually I cleared Level 39 but then found.myself back at Level 35 where I'm STUCK ! I've cleared it 4 times. Tried to contact the King Game people  by email. Will try Amazon.
0316548189|5.0|I love this book also, about a Great Man, who showed the world that we can accomplish good with just using our heads. After all, it's just sitting on top of our neck and shoulders! We don't have to search too far to get to it!
0439023513|5.0|The book came new and no kissing pages or anything. It's the real book! And it came shining and perfect and ready to be read!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am so hooked to this game that my wife is planning to take the tablet away from me I can't wait to unlock more characters. I also saw some other games I want to get.
B000002OR4|4.0|This was purchased for my daughter's ballet recital.  I have a great appreciation for the movie.  By itself, it takes a person certain taste.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a Harry Potter fan and have read all the books. These seem just the right thing to have around. Love watching the stars grow up, too.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|The movie was good, I enjoyed it.  It was what you expect in a good action/super hero movie.  ....But what i don't understand is why the volume was so low at times, and then when an action scene would start the volume would be way higher, so you keep having to adjust the volume.  This was so bad in this movie that I had to turn on CC to read what they were saying because even at 80% volume I still couldn't hear, and didn't want to be at 100% to then quickly have to adjust when a loud scene started.  I stream on amazon often, and on all others as well, but I rarely have this problem.  So not sure what they need to do to correct this.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really fun and the best part is that they have servers that are mini games and you can play with other people. But, I don't have the 0.8.0 update yet. Can some one tell me how to get the update? ;)
B0083P1QUM|2.0|It was disappointing.  I've been reading about Scarpetta from the start and hardly recognized her in this book.  She seemed whiney and ungrateful for the wonderful life she was finally living.  It was as though once she got what she wanted she was bored.  Even the case wasn't that well written.  I kept getting the feeling that Cornwell had a deadline to meet to produce another book and this was a throwaway.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|Wasted 15 min of my life waiting for it to download. Then the game wont even load to the title screen. I have a new Kindle Fire HD and it doesnt work on it. Thought this was the &quot;kindle&quot; version?
B00G5G7K7O|5.0|My wife, 22 year old daughter and I attended this today. I thought the first 60 minutes was quite simply the best movie I've seen in several years. This was based on a story from Hans Christian Anderson. As many of you know this movie had several starts and stops but the final result was amazing!<br /><br />The story was very unusual in that there was barely a villain as the major theme of the story is redemption of one of the female leads, Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) who has the power to control the cold and snow. Having seen Idina Menzel live she doesn't disappoint here. I find the strength (and the range!) of her vocal abilities stunning, especial considering her relatively small physical size.<br /><br />I did find Olaf the snowman a little irritating but otherwise this was a movie destined to be a classic. I didn't see the evil turn of Hans , a prince from another country there for the crowning of Elsa as queen.<br /><br />And the music was top notch as well. Animation was very well done with quite simply incredible detail!! My daughter said it was almost as good as 'The Little Mermaid' which is her favorite Disney movie!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - I would rate this a 9.5 to 9.75 out of 10!!!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I tried updating it so I could play the new short fuse levels but it says I have to buy a new version of angry birds! Why can't it update my current version?!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Of my four Muse albums, this is my favorite.  It is one of the more theatrical Muse albums, and several songs are among my all-time favorite Muse tracks (e.g., Map of the Problematique, Knights of Cydonia).  Like other Muse albums, they integrate unusual styles or sounds into their rock format (e.g, Take a Bow sounds like a mix of Phillip Glass mixed with Queen), which is an experimental aspect of Muse's music that I think makes them a joy to listen to.  Very highly recommended!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|The app said it would update to the new December 2013 artic levels but it hasn't been updated or released into this app and I'm very angry about that!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|This was a very funny movie just as the 2 previous movies before this one. Major trouble follows this gang every time they get together it would seem.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am having difficulty when clicking on buy more.  It won't load the page and has been doing this for two days now.  What do I do.  I like this because I love puzzles.  Help me please.<br />Please solve this issue.  I love this game besides having this issue.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So happy I finally got to view Season 3, worth the wait! Excellence in acting and riveting story line. Awesome!
B004WR125O|4.0|Got this to hook up my 525 receiver to internet. I wanted something to listen to the Dutch radio stations. Yes, I do get them through the computer. But when I'm in my living room and working on other things with the laptop, this should work, right?<br />Anyway, opened the box, plugged it in, and did the manual setup. Enter my network password, easy peasy, 5 minutes and I'm listening to Radio Veronica's Ben Liebrand. Yeah! Not bad for $20.<br />Did subtract 1 start for low (35-50%) signal. Should be higher IMO, since I'm fairly close to my router. My laptop is at just about 100.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a bit addictive...and can be expensive because you have to buy moves it you can't beat a level.  I wish I could just buy the game outright.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Of course I cried. I'm a cancer survivor. Leukemia at the age of 5. If my friend had told me what this book was about, I might not have read it. But I'm glad I did. I fell in love with the characters and will read more by this author. Although I do kinda associate him with Van Hauten, now. But I know that's just transference or whatever the proper word is.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Very funny, but has its crude moments (for those easily offended).  Simple entertainment that we all crave for sitting on the couch with adults (not for children!)
B006XF5BTG|5.0|great book to really get started with weight training and eating properly. Mike Matthews sheds light on many myths of strength training and nutrition, which helps to gain insight into making intelligent decision about building muscle and getting leaner. He has designed programs in an easy to follow format, which for beginners, like myself, allows us to begin exercising correctly and eating properly. I almost hired a personal trainer to learn some techniques, and I still might, but I feel I'm learning all I need to know (for now) in proper and safe lifting techniques. I've been following his 5 day program for 3 weeks now, and although I'm very sore, I'm beginning to notice some changes in my body. I'm basically a skinny guy with a tummy, so am trying to build muscle, put on weight, without adding fat.<br />I've tried many exercise programs over the years and have never really stuck with any of them, but Bigger Leaner Stronger has really helped  motivate me. It's intense and involves making important decisions and having discipline and will power, but it's easy to follow, and doesn't really take that much time. I spend about an hour at the gym after work doing strength training. And the exercises are organized in a way that I don't get too tired. Part of the problem in the past was that I tried to do too much in one session.<br />I highly recommend this book for someone who wants to building muscle and get into shape.
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|I hated it. It was silly and completely unrealistic. I usually like the animated movies and they usually have a lot of adult humor in them, but this one was just plain stupid.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really didn't know much about Tesla. This is a really quick read loaded with interesting facts about Nikola Tesla.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|Affecting storytelling, Compelling narrative structure, a great ensemble cast, cinematography, music and editing all combined in a forcefully memorable film.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Photo Editor is so far the BEST (Not to mention free) editing app I've seen! It has great effects, frames, tools, and more! You won't regret buying this app!
B000SGGUWS|4.0|Really good book. The tv series is also amazing, if not better. The book is pretty short, though. I finished it in one day. Anyways, great book.<br />~Janaya
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Hard to believe so many years have passed since that amazing story was told. This book picks up three years later and that history is rarely mentioned  but it is relevant.  The main characters are the same but the parties have changed.  I could easily see this compelling story become a movie as well.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|In the genre of &#34;monster movies with a heroic defense of humanity led by a multi-racial cast who come together for sacrifice and love, saving the world and learning something in the process&#34; this is a standout entry. An underrated gem of a movie, and certainly better than anything Michael Bay has ever directed. Don't set your expectations too high, but definitely watch this one.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett, but sometimes his novels just bog down too far to continue. This one, however, was entertaining and educating from cover to cover. I must admit the events were before my time and so I was intrigued with the storyline, but even while providing us with less than exciting material at times, he kept his characters alive and involved. I will be purchasing #2 and #3 of this series. Anytime I have a book that draws me back to reading more, it is a keeper in my estimation.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The game create a surreal effect as it takes you from your little house into a mystical world. Makes me feel like I just entered Narnia. Very relaxing with interesting puzzles. Story is not too in depth, but that's actually a positive as you can imagine your own story as you explore from room to room.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Was a very good game until I took the update 3 days Ago.  Since then I have not been able to connect via Facebook.  Not sure what happened, hopefully they can fix the issue.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|It was an interesting story about botany and a woman's early role in life during the 1800s.  I was surprised to find some rather frank sexual passages in the book.  I will say, however, that the passages were not contrived.  They did fit with the story.  I was engaged in the story throughout and felt satisfied by the ending.  I would recommend this book to others.  I loved the early history of plants in the book as well.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great Blue Tooth device for active professionals. Comfortable yet reliable ear piece and really good audio. This charging case provides good protection and holds several charges of it's own for long days in the field.
B008476HBM|5.0|Which I truly am. Although I have been crossed in love. Broken hearted even.  I never give up on love! Since my earliest memory of my first encounter with this book I have always loved love.  This literary masterpiece as taught me to be patient and wait for it and  to never settle for anyone less deserving. This will forever be apart of my personal collection of books. And will always be my favourite book of all time...well outside of the bible..which calls for it's own review!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Very Good Movie!!  It is interesting and fun to watch.  It is a totally different take on the Snow White story.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Very good movie!  It is a lot of fun and interesting.  It has great music and the characters are hilarious.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think jet pack is fun because you get to shoot things out of your jet pack. I love it. Awesome game.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|great game. would be better if the guns weren't so expensive. would be a five star if so. good graphics. plenty of different game to hunt
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a really good game. Only problem is once I start playing, I can't seem to stop :) good boredom buster
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|No problems with the content - how could there be? SW is amazing.  But I ordered this a month and half ago and have just now been able to watch Episode VI. (there are 6 discs in total if you count both Blue-Ray and DVD, so getting through all of them takes a bit.) The DVD skips terribly, it's unwatchable.  If it weren't past the return deadline, I'd definitely return for a refund.  If you buy this product, try to watch as soon as possible to check for disc damage.  How disappointing...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some infinties are bigger than others. And as I am not as wise as Augustus waters nor Hazel Grace I realize that life is the biggest infinity because there is no other. One of my favorites, next to The Help. Yes I believe in God and heaven, but I take the capital-S something/somewhere to heart.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Intelligent writing with a female lead.  Katness is a real young woman who is &#34;finding&#34; herself.  Then, of course, she is thrown into adulthood and we get to see, hear, read, feel how she does so.<br /><br />She also has her faults, but the writer shows how she works through them, and we get to hear what's in her head while she does that.<br /><br />Hated that Prim dies.
B000BMYWYC|2.0|As a person that had just gotten into the scale modelling hobby, I bought this glue because it had a brush, it was clear, and it is known for a good bond. I used this product for two months, and while it was everything I knew it would be; the problem I had most was with the overpowering smell of it. The other reviews don't talk enough about the truly insidious quality found in the smell that looms and lingers in the room long after you've closed it up and stopped using it. The toxic scent is that of fingernail polish remover but it clings to your nasal passages like a fume. I ventilated the room with a ceiling fan, central air and had the window up, but to no avail. After only thirty minutes assembling a model, I would begin to cough. If used for a couple hours, afterwards I would feel edgy and agitated. I was in denial of these problems due to my love of a new hobby and thinking I needed to toughen up if I was going to enjoy myself. However after I realized my feeling drained and burned out was part and parcel because of the use of this product, I stopped using it. I have not used it in two months and I never felt the way I did while using it.<br /><br />The fact is the label says, &#34;WARNING: This product contains chemicals which are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and reproductive harm.&#34;<br /><br />So if you care more about the adhesive quality than the smell and the potentially damaging quality of the chemical vapors, this is your product. Before I gave up this hobby altogether, I found an alternative, but this product made me wonder if the health side effects were worth the finished product of a finished model.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed the intertwining plots and the flashbacks in each chapter. Good and easy read! Fast paced and keeps you interested.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I am a pretty big fan of dystopia novels and it has been a long time since I have read a contemporary one that I like. The Circle is an interesting novel that takes a look at social media and its impact on society. Like all good dystopias it examines a current technology or aspect of society and drags it out to to an illogical but fascinating and somewhat horrifying conclusion. The Circle examines how social media errodes privacy, and makes some interesting comments about how this technology impacts &#34;the self&#34;. I would recommend this novel to any one who likes a good dystopia. Obviously, Dave Eggers doesn't have the ability of say Ray Bradbury, George Orwewll, or Aldous Huxley but he is a better writer than Suzanne Collins who's hunger games some how gets lumped into the dystopia genre.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was so anxious to read this book because of all the hype surrounding it. I get people don't like how it ended, but I thought it was pretty good still. Personally, I have no problem with the ending, even if it is not what I was expecting. This book was a lot slower than the first two – not nearly the action and a lot more time spent explaining things – though it had its good points as well.<br /><br />I actually went into this thinking I was going to be disappointed with the explanations given, but I wasn't. There was a lot of conflict even inside those explanations – and as vague as that is I can't say more without giving away too much. I think the thing I liked the best about the book, and really the whole story overall, is that there was no clear-cut black and white right or wrong. There was no real antagonist – yes there were bad people making bad choices, but they thought their choices were the right ones for the right reasons. So what it comes down to is when all you have is bad options, pick the ones you can live with.<br /><br />Though this was my least favorite book of the three, I did enjoy the series overall and am glad it ended when it did.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Very fun toy, but the batteries die quickly if you sonic things a lot. Oh well, at least the universe is in tact, right?
B00B1LN8WY|1.0|All discs skip and wont play.  Dont buy this particular set.  I sent this back due to all the playback issues.  Otherwise it would have been a great set.
1476747016|5.0|I got it in the mail very quickly and fell deeply in love with it!! It's such an adorable book and a must have for all pusheen the cat fans!! &#60;3
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All of the books in this series at really good. They are funny and beat the competitors. I really liked this book and look forward to reading book number eight.
0756982596|5.0|I do not think that's how Llama's behave! Perfectly delightful reader for small children. A must have for any wee-one on your list.
B000SW2F80|5.0|I watch this movie many times with my brother it's always fun classic to watch  mini series with each telling a different story
B00AW57L96|5.0|I loved it. Everyone should read it. Reinforces so much about the truth in life around us. The world spins on a dime and thing's can change your life forever, in the blink of an eye. Relationships are complicated and not full of sparkling romance as you so would like them to be. That doesn't mean they aren't worth having. The choices we make have huge implications in our lives which we often don't want to acknowledge because that ultimately means we are the masters of our own destiny for better and for worse.
B00280LYHS|5.0|it's a really great book, perfect for elementary through junior high.<br />I couldn't take my eyes of of it. No matter how many times I read it<br />It never gets old. Riordan does an extravagant job of keeping the reader content
B0000TB014|5.0|Rekindled old memories of the 80's (and yes; the 70's) and this guy definitely comes to mind. Very memorable and soothing music. Mike was always the king of pop.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|A terrific, motivational read. I highly recommend this book to anyone, who wants to live life with purpose, priority and productivity!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. Great graphics. I love the gameplay. It's simple and engaging. I'm hooked. Been playing for hours a day. I have this on my phone and my tablet. Can't get enough.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Should be a classic if not considered one.  The acting is superb, the music score is the best, cinematography will have you sweating along with the &#34;fire eaters&#34; and the story line will take your emontions on a roller coaster ride.  Definitely one of my favorite movies.  No problems with the disc.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  A great read.  It is a detailed description of the actual story and what led up to the Bin Laden ending.
B003ZDO90G|4.0|I have not been a fan of short stories, and only tried these after Munro won a Nobel prize for literature but from the first story I was engrossed. I felt that her stories showed something about human nature and / or the human condition and were also very readable and absorbing. Perhaps the last story didn't quite match the others
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Absolutely awesome movie!  It is rated R for a reason and is not a 'kid' movie. But great flick for adults.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|This is one of the best geography games I have found.  Not only are there multiple games within the game but so aspect aspects of geography are covered from actual physical geography to capitals to flags.  There is also a bit of physics thrown in for good measure.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book handles the painful subject of early onset Alzheimer's with clarity and compassion.  Written from the viewpoint of a brilliant woman experiencing the rapid but erratic process of dementia, it gives the reader a new way of thinking about how we know who we are.  It's a must read for anyone dealing with or facing the prospect of dementia of any kind, whether in the family or personally.
B00E8JZILA|4.0|Great game a good 15-20 hours of game play .<br />Got for great price .<br />Def worth it .<br />Fun and on the edge of tour seat the whole time
B00FLDG52I|1.0|The sync is so bad that the drummers sticks are in the air on the beat! Although this is the worst I've seen, I've bought several concert disks now that have this same problem.  The industry just doesn't give a crap what kind of &#34;stuff&#34; they stick the customer with anymore.  You'd think Eric would care and try to do something to fix this.  I mean this thing cost me 17 bucks!  I'm going to try to get my money back, but usually once the package is open you're stuck.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show, good acting, engaging plots. No wonder Benedict Cumberbatch got tapped for major motion picture work. I just hope they come back with more of these after Star Trek finishes filming.
B000NA28I4|4.0|I have read all the Eragon books and loved them. Many people who are fans of the books say this movie was a failure, but I disagree. The movie was no more that it could have been. There are a couple parts that I do think the could have done better though.<br /><br />1) The way Eragon and Brom's relationship was completely overlooked. When Brom dies, people who haven't read the books won't care at all. In the movie it doesn't seem like they are that close.<br /><br />2) Saphira  changed from a baby to an adult dragon in a matter of seconds, which I thought was kind of lame. They director should have done a montage instead.<br /><br />3) The girl who played Areya. I thought that casting for her was pretty bad. The person they got to play her just wasn't right.<br /><br />But overall I thought the movie was very good. People are complaining so much and its like: &#34;They can't include every detail of everything. Just look at the movie overall.&#34; If you are a die-hard fan you might not like the movie as much, but they can't please everyone. If you really love the books I'm sure you will enjoy the movie as well.
B007I0OY02|5.0|Tina Fey is a comedic Genius! She totally gets it! I couldn't put it down. I found my self laughing out loud!
B002DMJLTE|5.0|Have to own this one! One of Tea Leoni's best movies.  I never tire of this movie- it's one of my favorites!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|All his books are good, but this was outstanding.  It started out good and got better with each page and had a great ending.  I did not want this book to end.
B009K86D86|5.0|This is information we all need to know. While it's upsetting to see the truth, we need to take control over what we're eating.
1468161660|5.0|Love love love. I can't wait to get the second book. The story is beautiful and returned me to my live of poetry.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Sycamore Row is well-written.  It flows well and as a sequel, it does a good job maintaining the personalities of the characters from TIME TO KILL.  Unfortunately, the story lacks that suspenseful, punch one has come to expect from a Grisham novel.  This is still a good book; just not a great one.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Sorry to see them all go, but my goodness it took forever to crawl my way to the end of this last one!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|This was a good entertaining movie with laughs at every turn. Not a work of art or Oscar material but great humor.
B007IX383I|5.0|Most excellent album.  I haven't listened to Anathema since the early days... and frankly I didn't care for it.  This is definitely more mainstream, but the emotional intensity and the composition/production of the material is second to none.<br /><br />Highlights are pretty much the whole album.  Ones that stick in my head are &#34;Sunlight&#34;, &#34;Lightning Song&#34; and the opening &#34;Untouchable&#34; songs.  But really...there aren't any bad songs here.  Perhaps not progressive enough for prog-heads and not hard enough for metal fans, but it is a musically brilliant album.  You can feel the sun rising in Sunlight... you can hear the storms gathering and feel the calm afterwards.  I cannot explain it adequately but the connection of the sound to the visuals to the emotions is as good as I've experienced in many years.<br /><br />I love Steven Wilson's work, but the production on this album by Christer-Andre Cederberg far surpasses the work Wilson did on &#34;We're Here Because We're Here&#34; (which is itself a good album).  It is masterful.<br /><br />Set aside preconceptions of what Anathema &#34;should&#34; be and just have a listen.  It is in heavy rotation on my music list and has been for the 2 months since I purchased the album.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|this movie sucks. boring, and the story sucks, acting was bad also. the movie was a complete waste of my time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's differently something that will keep you entertained. Good for kids and time consuming. it will drive you completely bananas
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This is a captivating story which brings us to the underbelly of Indian culture and you truly feel you are there!  Great character development. Clearly juxtaposes the class differences in India and contrasts the American culture and cultural expectations!  Well written. I look forward to reading another book by Gowda!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this is a sad story, I really enjoyed reading this book and all of the characters.  I highly recommend this book.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 yr old grandson enjoys this game when he completes the puzzles by matching the shapes. He especially enjoys the rewards of floating balloons. He likes hearing the balloons when he pops them.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the tool I needed to clean up my mess that I always download on my kindle just the best
B003YUC2FE|5.0|i bought this for my grandson's birthday. He and his little brother just love watching all 3 movies and it helps his mom work a few hours from home.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Beautiful and touching film. My 6 year old loved it so much he asked and asked for a copy. He is eight now and still watches it on occasion.  Happy to find it through Amazon. It was used but in perfect condition and at a more reasonable price than new. Worth watching and then watching again. The cinematography is stunning.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|This movie was the retelling of the movie &#34;Cars&#34;.  The animation was good and my two three year old twin grandkids enjoyed the movie and Dusty is now as much a hero to them as Lightning McQueen is.  It's a fun movie with great pictures and the kids loved it.
1419705849|5.0|Love the reasonably priced hard back copy. More durable for a book that has been read and reread. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series hooked my 2nd grader on reading. He reads more of a variety now in 3rd grade but returns to these over and over.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This is one of the best new television shows of recent years, and may be one of the few that is worthwhile to buy. The actors are superb, the writing is amazing (plainly inspired by the books), and the story is a thrilling ride. I just absolutely love this show. If you like horror, psychological thrillers, and/or the Hannibal movies, you should definitely check this out!<br /><br />The concept is &#34;What was Hannibal like before being imprisoned?&#34;, a practicing cannibal and serial killer living among normal people. While that is a big part of the show, the major plot focuses on Will Graham, a professor who has given up being a detective, though he consults in small local cases with the police. He is offered a consulting job with the FBI BAU to help solve serial killer cases, and meets Hannibal there, who is also consulting. Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect Hannibal, though interpreted differently than Anthony Hopkins's portrayal (which makes sense because he hasn't been in prison for years). Hugh Dancy as Will Graham is also incredible, totally believable. All the characters have great actors, actually. It's a very visually stylistic show. Very beautiful overall, though the gore will probably make you cringe :)
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very scary!! I was so surprised how suspenseful this series was to me! My family keeps asking &#34;Why do you do this to yourself?!!!&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that candy crush is the best game because try have candy in there and I live candy and again they have candy in the store!!!!!!!
B004I744AS|4.0|It's a dictionary !  It seems to be accurate and well organized. Usage and time will tell me whether or not it lives up to my expectations.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|All of Stieg Larsson's books are magnificent.  This is no exception.  He writes a great story with sensational characters.  It is too bad he has passed and will write not more.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|The music, history, personal tragedy and inspiration of Mozart's life and far too early death, the acting, inspired casting of Tom Hulce as Mozart
B001NLKT60|5.0|Stieg Larsson writes a great mystery, thriller, novel.  His character development is outstanding and story line a real grabber.  I definitely recommend this book.
B000066AXE|5.0|Russel Crowe gives an outstanding performance in his portrayal of a man plagued by mental illness. This movie offers great insight into the world of some in our midst who do not see things the way most people do.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Captivating. A John Gresham novel to remember.  One of his best..couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.  Surprised throughout the book.
B00013F38K|5.0|If you grew up in the 70's, then you may remember this t.v. show which aired at that time. I was only 11yrs. old then and can vividly recall just how much of an impact this show had on me back then, just as much as it has helped to shape some of my philosophies in this present day.<br /><br />Granted, by today's standards, the show may be slow paced and at times presents some awkward dialog.<br /><br />But if one has the patience and willingness (traits that are also illustrated example lessons brought up for consideration as part of the storylines) to slow down and really 'absorb'  what is trying to be said... the main character's situation as a stranger in a foriegn land...wanted (regretfully but unjustly, also a matter of perspective) for murder... despised and looked down upon because of the ignorance of those who do not understand his race and culture and yet he posseses a physical discipline and spiritual wisdom to deal with how and why these things are all part of the human condition, you'll find the character of Kwai Chang Caine a very inspiring and unique individual.<br /><br />Pretty deep stuff for an 11 yr. old (or for that matter, American television back then).<br /><br />Great life lessons are a part of the benefit of this show.<br />As much as I loved Kung Fu, it would be great to see a tv show today which (perhaps in an updated sophisticated setting that younger people can relate to, although I do have a hard time endeavoring to be tolerant with some of today's moral standards) would present some of the thought provoking scenarios that were prevalent in alot of the episodes in this series.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|awesome awesome movie I love the minions buy it is you have the chance or see it at the movies
B009KS4XRO|5.0|played a lot of the bingo games on the kindle this is by far the best,  could be a little more free with the bingo tokens especially with the holiday games.
B00G70WLJA|3.0|Movie was just OK. Not the best, but still exciting. Almost everything in the story was as expected, except the very end.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have to wait over &amp; over again for it to download.  I hate this app.This app is just a waste of money.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|my granddaughter put it on phone and it interrupts calls, sleep, and is so annoying i am going to delete it.
B000067QMD|5.0|I bought these discs after my little one moved from the 4oz bottle to the 9oz bottles. They allow me to use the smaller bottles to store breast milk, formula and water. They work well on my Avent natural 4oz and 9oz. bottles and can be sterilized in microwave steam bags.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Although written so long ago,this Christmas classic is a joy to read and renews the true meaning of Christmas spirit.
0316204366|5.0|Excellent author and topic. Malcolm Gladwell makes you think …in a different sort of way.  You don't have to agree with his conclusions, but I appreciate the way he looks at the world.  I have read his other book, &#34;Outliers&#34;, and enjoyed it as well.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Not the action I had expected from such a fan of kung fu movies. The thing that makes foreign kung fu movies cool is the comedy combined with amazing fight scenes and action.  This movie had the gimicky jokes and gore but no high flying action.  I hate to say it but maybe Rza should stick to what he knows, making music.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|use it as my main web browser for android.. it's a nice solid browser.. I use the desktop version on android.. so it looks like it would if browsing on an actual pc.. that's why I like it most..
B000WS4P5G|5.0|Classic Danzig.  You wouldn't buy this if you weren't already a fan, but Danzig never disappoints.  His music is enduring and always worth listening to.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|part of the Sky.fm family.. I actually use this app more than there main app.. I'm more into Trance/Dance music and this app fits the bill 100% subscription is required for 5 bucks a month.. worth every penny..
006202406X|5.0|Amazing book i loved it, didn't end the way that i had hoped but still excellent book and i would recommend it to as many people would listen.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it kept me on the edge of my seat! I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
B0015AARJI|2.0|These controls came pavkaged nicely but they dont work, the stay on for two minutes and then shuts off during game play and have to stay on the charger
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the game.  seems fun with some challenge would like to see more levels.  If there is more levels and they are more challenging maybe add a little help or hint button.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|This Western Digital 2go app lets you instantly have access to all your cloud storage such as Drop Box, SkyDrive and GoogleDrive.  All you need to do is switch between them.  You can not alter anything but you can read anything just like if you had sent it to your Kindle Docs.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|pretty standard actioner. Just a bit above average.  There are a few 'oh come on' moments but, overall the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Will change your views about everything you do and how you \\"run\\" your life. Wish I would've came across this book sooner
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great free game. Simple and fun... but very addictive. Kind of similar to Bejeweled, with some added elements.
0375842209|5.0|This book was truly phenomenal. I read it many years ago when in middle school and having read it recently, while in college, I can safely say this is one of my favorite books. Even though the targeted readers are young adults, I feel like this book can easily be meant for adults. While the time period of the book is set during the holocaust and WWII, it is not a war book. Rather, it is the story of an abandoned girl struggling to make sense of the craziness that is Germany. I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this novel. It is the kind of book where you laugh and cry with the characters.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great story, but I would not recommend it for kids under 17.  I wasn't sure where it was going during the opening, and I admit, I missed the vodka bottles.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Good season, but a little bit predictable. There is a lot of tension within each episode, but at the end of the day, everyone is safe and sound. Still, this show introduces interesting worlds and concepts, and has enough drama to keep me interested. It's a solid show, with decent plot and decent, if predictable, characters.<br /><br />I wish this show hadn't been canceled.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This was by far the best concert to watch and hear, and it's so sweet to be able to relive it. She is captivating and the production was the most top notch that I have ever witnessed. Nothing has come close to the artistry of this tour.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've had the pleasure to purchase all seven years. The collection is a big part of my daughter's collection of videos.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good app. Same as the Face book app. Fun to play. Keeps my attention and skill level is fantastic. Love it!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Enjoyable science fiction tale with all the usual elements.  The strongest point was the agreeable young cast with probably the strongest performance coming from the young lady protagonist.  And, the monster was pretty good and not such a bad sort after all.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I am not a serious podcast listener, but I can see the amount of time spent listening increasing thanks to this app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing show. The acting and the storytelling are just spectacular. It's dramatic and funny and a joy to watch.  Amazing cast. Maggie Smith is a delight.
B000002AH9|5.0|Remarkable as this was her last recording.  Music is melodious and poignant despite her raspy sounding voice.  The orchestration is exceptionally good.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I bought the Kindle edition a few days ago for 9.99, today, could have it for 2.99? iid this right?
B00009W0U4|5.0|The movie is good but the story is very gritty.  It's good to have films delve into mankinds darker side.  This film delivers.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I like the cover...wish it contained a &#34;pocket&#34;.  If it had a pocket I could use it to carry a business card of something of that nature.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Hanging Tree<br /><br />Just a great story with so many twists and turns.  Good characters.  Hard not to like the maid and hate his kids and ex-wives.

B00GLX1MG6|3.0|very funny movie with an extremely limited vocabulary.  kind of a cross between airplane and listening to an eddie murphy comedy special.  if you want to hear the f word a few thousand times interspersed with a couple of other words than this movie is for you.  if you are watching just for the pole dance watch true lies as that was a lot better pole dance.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This is such a cute movie! My kids ages range from 6 to 12 and they are all entertained by it. It keeps the adults entertained, too, so you won't mind when the kids want to watch it again.
0684808323|3.0|Casino was okay. I had hoped for a more detailed look into the story I already understood. Details were not as interesting as I had hope....Well written dry subject....
B00355L2TU|5.0|A super hard work out that gives super results. This video goes in six minute circuits: 3 minutes of strength training, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute of core work. Just when you feel like dying, you move on to something new and you can breathe again. The only thing I would say to watch out for is if you have bad knees. After doing this 4 to 5 days a week for two weeks, my knees really hurt and I was careful with my form.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I chose this rating because the story was great for what it is.  It had a couple minor appearances from the previous book(except Danny ).  the details about Danny's past from the shining were kept in tact.<br /><br />the main weakness was that some parts of the climax were fuzzy because it felt like the main protagonists and antagonist got jumbled if you lost track of what was going on.<br /><br />either way if you like the shining, you will like this sequel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun, easy, and free.  Challenging but keeps you sharp and mentally active.  If you need a break once in a while.

0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal is a really great author.  He kind of reminds me of the guy who wrote Looking For Alaska.
1250012570|5.0|I finished this in about six hours... it was that good. I've never considered myself a YA person, but novels like this and TFiOS just prove that high school is no laughing matter, not something adults can or should shrug off because it's &#34;for kids.&#34; This book is about kids, but it's so very adult, in a good way. In the way that makes it exactly perfect for high schoolers and everyone else to read.
B008220C38|2.0|Fancy window dressing and art for art’s sake fail to compensate for what is simply a creaky morality point of view from the latter part of the 19th Century.  Worse than being irrelevant for the early 21st Century, it’s just plain boring as a film.  The machinery of using a play within a play and film inside and outside of a play becomes tedious rather quickly as well as virtually eliminating the chance of building audience bonding with the protagonists.  Just when character empathy starts to build, the machinery dashes this prospect by repeatedly and abruptly shifting from film-generated intimacy to distant, formal stage play by actors who do not seem to have much in the way of (or are prevented from exhibiting) stage-acting presence.  The silliness includes unending disco-dancing waltzes, meaningless mannerism, and a model electric train that predate the invention of the light bulb.  Gigantic misuse of talent on all levels (above and below the line) with the exception of the film score which is brimming with very cleaver audio segues and leif motifs.  Be prepared to be seriously underwhelmed.<br />WILLIAM FLANIGAN

B00942Y35S|5.0|Great quality viewing without interruptions.  This story is more for the family or teenage girls but was a cute romance.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Very entertaining look into the world of illusions and how several magicians pull off clever heists to steal money. Great performances by Eisenberg, Fischer, Harrelson and the rest.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|High above the world of Cars comes a low-altitude spin-off that never quite takes off. That's right, three aviation puns in one sentence. And if that has you rolling your eyes, brace yourself for director Klay Hall's Planes, a well-intentioned family-friendly racer sure to entertain younger kids, and just the kids. There's nothing particularly terrible about the film, and it's certainly not as bad as you've probably heard. Still, the animation lacks the fresh coat of paint typical of most theatrically released CG-animated spectacles, Jeffrey M. Howard's screenplay relies heavily on familiar clich&eacute; after familiar clich&eacute; and, sorry to say, the voice cast isn't all that special. Not so surprising considering the pseudo-sequel began its life as a DisneyToon Studios direct-to-video project and was only later promoted to feature film status at the last minute. And yet Planes remains a decidedly direct-to-video adventure, with Hall and company distilling elements of Cars and Cars 2 into a cute, harmless, ultimately unremarkable underdog story most parents have sat through a hundred times before.<br />When a crop duster with big dreams named Dusty (Dane Cook) defies all odds and narrowly qualifies for the globe-spanning Wings Across the World race, he finds himself jetting from New York to Iceland, Germany, India, Nepal, Shanghai, Mexico and back across the United States. To win, he'll have to out-maneuver and outrace an array of international fliers, including mean-spirited reigning champ, Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith), and his toadies, Ned and Zed (Gabriel Iglesias); French-Canadian racer, Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); stuffy Brit, Bulldog (John Cleese); passionate Mexican Gee Bee, El Chupacabra (Carols Alazraqui); and Indian love interest Ishani (Priyanka Chopra). And it'll take everything Dusty's got, along with a little help from his friends: best friend Chug (Brad Garrett), mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher), reluctant mentor Skipper Riley (Stacey Keach), forklift Sparky (Danny Mann), Super Hornet duo Bravo and Echo (Top Gun alumni Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards), and others who rally behind the crop-dusting upstart.<br /><br />Despite Hall and Howard's best efforts -- and the two do make a concerted effort -- there's not a lot to Planes that isn't derived from the series' core films. From the quaint but sharply penned Cars comes the clash of vehicular cultures and destinies, the racing scene, a fish out of water adventure, a romantic subplot, a crusty old racing mentor haunted by his past, a cocky rival desperate to win at all costs (he's even green and black, just like ol' Chick Hicks), several sidekicks in the making, and, of course, a glimpse into the eerie but amusing world of sentient cars with no human masters. (Why is Dusty dusting crops exactly? Other than the fact that he's a crop duster?) From the maligned Cars 2 comes the international hotspots, a colorful cast of multinational racers (each one showcasing a bigger stereotype than the last), the thrills and chills of a worldwide race mixed with... you get the idea. Planes is at its finest when imagining how a society of planes would function in the larger Cars world, and when humanizing its aeros and autos. But sparks of imagination don't seem to come as freely or frequently as before, and Dustys rise to fame is far more derivative than it is original.<br /><br />Ironically, had Planes never dared to dream more than a direct-to-video dream, it would have been more successful. The film struggles to inflate itself to theatrical proportions, reaching for the stars and barely lifting off the ground. There are laughs to be had, an exciting but predictable race to follow, and enough lovable personalities -- yes, even Cook's Dusty -- to keep the movie in the air. It rarely soars, though, and even at its best, tends to skim the surface of its potential. Adults would do well to watch the disc's behind-the-scenes featurette, &#34;Klay's Flight Plan&#34;, and only then giving Planes a go. Realizing how much of the film a personal passion project was for Hall makes for a richer experience. The story still only skims the surface, but the heart it proudly wears on its wings suddenly begins to shine that much brighter. Kids, on the other hand, needn't invest any prep time. Planes will strike anyone under ten as a fun, wondrous race across the skies of one of their favorite animated universes; one with a few life lessons worth reinforcing. As family entertainment geared for the grade school set goes, it excels. As a Pixar spin-off, though, it lacks a certain level of magic, wit and refinement.<br /><br />Disney's Planes looks great on Blu-ray, with a pristine 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation. Colors are bright, vibrant and playful, and bathed in convincing light and shadow. Primaries are strong and black levels inky, with consistent contrast and unhindered clarity. Detail is quite striking, with crisp edges and exacting textures, and aliasing isn't a concern. Perhaps more thrilling is Planes' DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track, even if the film's original sound design isn't really all that engrossing. Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without anything in the way of muffled or buried lines. Voices tend to float in the mix, but no more so than in most animated films. LFE output, meanwhile, embraces every engine chug and roar, propeller drone, and dive-bomb attack, making the most of the adventure's every racing sequence.<br /><br />Planes would have been better off abandoning the racing scene of the first two Cars movies and focusing instead on something new to the series' universe. Private and commercial aviation, the Air Force, the daring rescue work glimpsed in the trailer for next year’s Planes: Fire & Rescue... just a few of the tantalizing possibilities that would have set Hall's spin-off free. Not that kids will care. Younger children will have a blast, if only because they won't notice just how much Planes begs, borrows and lifts from a hundred other underdog stories. Disney's Blu-ray release is more satisfying, fortunately, with an excellent video presentation and involving DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track. Its supplemental package is much too direct-to-video for a film that earned a theatrical release, but complaints end there. Bottom line? You could do a whole lot worse this holiday season. Planes is perfect for the kiddies, even if it will prove somewhat disappointing for parents.hen giving Planes a go.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Super Sycamore!  This is truly one of Grisham's best, and they all rate high marks. Just read it. Even friends who are not avid mystery/lawyer book fans loved it. Lots of sub-plots with the main thread. You'll love the protagonist.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the best version of &#34;Emma.&#34; Very true to the book. I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Mr. Knightly. Michael gam on is also perfect as Mr. Woodhouse. Beautifully filmed, the early nineteenth century British village life is charmingly portrayed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love to read John :)<br /><br />g<br /><br />just great book with many twists and surprises, and hard to put down, even sleep
B008JFUS5A|1.0|Adolescents like non-stop action with little to think about.  Yes, \\"there was always action\\" - senseless, meaningless action.  A GOOD drama - play, movie, tv episode - varies the intensity, mixing quiet with noisy scenes so the audience is not tired out by non-stop action.  Besides the lack of variety, too much of the plot just made no sense.  Absence of graphic violence? Perhaps the reviewer who wrote this was at the concession stand when Kathness's lover was being brutally flogged by a storm trooper, or when the resulting horrid gashes were being treated with some caustic liquid that made him scream in agony. Many were the antagonists who were skewered by Kathness's magic bow and arrows, which were washed into the artificial lake at one point, only to reappear in the next minute in her hand, her quiver magically replenished from three to a dozen arrows. No doubt about it - she's a special gal!  About the only good thing in this film - which was all middle, since its beginning is in an earlier movie and its resolution is still to come - was the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence, who is proving to be a major talent who fully deserves the academy award given to her so early in her career.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Loved the different narrative perspective Zusak used. Easy read, would've liked more &#34;meat&#34; to the story but I'll admit I was terry when I finished it while on the metro!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. I thought it was stupid but I found myself scrambling to upgrade my robot and give it sexy decals! I haven't seen the movie, but I do now, as this game has wet my appetite to smash some more real steel!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I enjoyed the first 2/3 of the movie more than the end.  It could have used 10 minutes less 'fight scenes' replaced by more 'human interest' stuff... his history, maybe a few scenes saving people and being the mystery hero.  I thought the end dragged on a bit.  Other than that, great movie, and some great twists on the typical Superman movie.  I watched it twice :-)
0395389496|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I purchased a number of them for Christmas gifts for my grandchildren. The illustrations are magnificent and the story is heartwarming. I would recommend the book to anyone--old and young.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|I tend to take my D800 on long outings, often away from power sources. This option gives me the ability to extend my battery life without having to swap out the extra batteries.

B000009HF2|4.0|This is one of those CD that 40- and 50- somethings secretly have in their collections, and as we age, we are less and less ashamed to admit just how much fun this live album really was.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This case looked good and worked well, at first. We kept it in the diaper bag. The problem was that the red slider button that you use to open it kept coming off. After a couple of weeks, it was lost and gone for good. I threw the case away, as it's open to the air without the red slider. I don't know how anybody with a baby or toddler around keeps track of the slider for this thing.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|Wonderful group of songs with a unique sound of rock/pop, especially since this is not my usually my taste.  Lead singer vocals are especially strong yet sensitive.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I've used this every day for my Nexus 10 since I received it 8 months ago.  It has performed excellently and held up perfectly under heavy use.  Two somewhat minor cons: (1) the cable is a bit short for my use, but this can be remedied with a usb extension cable (2) the connector is a bit prone to disconnecting when holding the tablet and using it in landscape orientation.  Overall, I highly recommend this accessory for the Nexus 10.
1451666179|5.0|Allie is amazing and the things she makes are both poignant and also make me laugh till I cry.  This book does have a lot of overlap from her website, but I'm more than happy to financially support someone who puts so much of herself into her work and is able to enunciate difficult things like clinical depression.

B00FEX2ZFG|1.0|Lacks verisimilitude.  Poorly written, highly unbelievable acting.  Made for children, perhaps?  Not scary at all.  Just annoying and a wastes of time.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Way better the second time around. The pace is quicker and not as detailed but you can really get to know the characters
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very fun &amp; well thought out puzzle app that gets me thinking. I love all the levels and details. The music in the app is very calming.
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|A good caper film has to bring the audience along. We might not understand why the characters did what they did until all becomes clear at the end, but part of the bargain is that it does become clear at the end. And that's one place Ocean's Thirteen falls a bit short. It assumes too much background from Eleven and, especially, Twelve. (If you don't recognize Francois Tolour, having the camera follow him without any sort of introduction won't make much sense). There are extraneous bits that muddy the waters. (Why did the building keep shaking? Why foment a lockout at the maquiladora?) And some important twists, such as the FBI agent's identity, lacked adequate foreshadowing.<br /><br />I also found myself missing the tightly-written dialog from Eleven. The dialog in this film is serviceable, but in Eleven it sparkled.<br /><br />Finally, some plot twists just weren't consistent with how we'd expect the characters to behave. For example, if Willy Bank is so ruthless--the film hints he's even more dangerous than Terry Benedict--would Danny Ocean really be so overt?<br /><br />Overall: three stars. Better than the Rat Pack's Ocean's 11, but not up to the quality of the 2001 Ocean's Eleven.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have been using the free version foe five months and it worked very well.  I converted to Pro and I am very satisfied with the additional features.  The fonts are working great. I recommend the purchase.  I am a Prime member and I saved a bunch, thanks Amazon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched every episode right after another, with a few breaks, and I thoroughly enjoyed every season so far.  I'm anxious for Season 4 to get under way.
B00F88U4J6|5.0|Great application.  I use it to read books on my Kindle Fire HD downloaded from the Gutenberg Project.  It is easy to use.
B00F9F1G4U|5.0|Easy to use, nice interface.  Good reports on performance relative to global averages. Keeps track of the history of the tests run and which type of test (LTE, wireless, etc.)
B005IT0V8O|5.0|The best grammar book ever written.  I carried a copy of this book since &#34;bone head English in 1961&#34;.  It is must have without exception.  I gave copies to staff at Xmas.  Now I have an electronic copy, life is beautiful! Thank you very much.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Kerman really gives a frank perspective about prison life and the unfortunate dysfunction of the prison system. I was pleasantly surprised the book is so different than the TV series. You get a different experience. A quick and insightful read!

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I can't say I'm as crazy about this show as some of the others here but I definitely enjoyed it and would like to have seen more seasons. I'm not really a big fan of mixing &#34;The Old West&#34; with sci-fi as those two genre's just don't really sync well, but here they make it work. This show has a lot of great laughs, interesting characters, and good effects. I'd recommend this to people of all types, not just sci-fi, the comedy and relationships between the crew are pretty universal.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|very interesting game..never get bored playing it..I love the different color and it is addictive..I could play for hours..really interesting..

0385349947|1.0|This is a book written by a lady who obtained everything a woman can dream of from her life.  She got a kind husband, kids, a high profile job, and supportive family.  AND she wants more.  It's astonishing some woman is so lucky to be able to keep getting what she wants and others who were born in dysfunctional families or lack of intelligence to be born with cannot even get one thing.<br /><br />Of course, Ms. Sandberg put impressive amount of effort to make those accomplishments.  But as one of those unfortunate ones myself, and even after I tried my best and obtained high level education, my hands are empty.  I felt not be able to relate and miserable reading this book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great game that never gets boring or too easy.  Some people will say that you have to buy power ups to get far, but that simply isn't true.  I'm on level 245 and I haven't bought one yet.  Yes, you get stuck for long periods of time on some of the higher levels... but that only makes it more  satisfying when you finally beat that level.
1442353279|5.0|I'm truly inspired by Total Recall. Very well written by a man that has achieved great success in a variety of forms.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|The entire series is going to be a classic.  J.J. Abrams is a master at keeping the viewing audience guessing as to what's going on.  Just when you think you got it, another twist comes along.  A great series.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|I wanted turn the movie off in the first ten seconds, but was prevented from doing so due to the collective curiosity in the audience. This desire to turn off the movie then repeated at a pace of every 10, 20 or 30 seconds throughout the entire movie stopping for longer periods of time when naked women appeared on the screen.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Forsyth again braids top war game technology with a nearly impossible scenario for a story with many interlocking parts that all click together for an exciting and satisfying resolution. I recommend this book, but it lacks Forsyth's usual meticulous characterization. For me, the hero remains a bit of a cypher. I don't understand how or why the author could have him be married and then a widower within a couple of paragraphs.  This is a well-told tale, but it doesn't work as well as Forsyth's usual standard because it is absent a psychological subplot. I do think it is an invaluable look at what wars of the future will look like.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a lot of fun to play and it helps with patience. :) You have to learn to wait for things. I enjoy the aspect of breeding different dragons. I also get a bit too involved in the races. I have an account on my android phone (the screen is a bit small but that isn't dragonvale's problem) I am attached to my Facebook account so I have friends with Dragonvale who I can &#34;visit&#34; and give gifts to.<br /><br />My 9 year old has an account on her Nabi, but because I won't let her have a Facebook account, she has no &#34;friends&#34;. She is enjoying playing just as much and is able to do plenty without the addition of being able to visit others etc.<br /><br />I think it's a pretty good game for all. :)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this book.  Beautifully written and a good story.  I also think it transcends ages.  After I finished reading it, I picked it up and read it to my 6 and 9 year olds.  They may not have gotten all of the points but they enjoyed it as well.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great book reading. Although it took Me a little while to finish this one, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend it

B0018YIW4S|4.0|One of my goals is to own some of the more critically acclaimed live recordings and that search has whittled down the titles to UFO's &#34;Strangers&#34;, Deep Purple's Live from Japan, Thin Lizzy's &#34;Love and Dangerous&#34;, and Rush's first live album, &#34;All the World's a Stage&#34;.  With a live album, I look for interaction with the crowd, a real &#34;live&#34; sound, not just note for note playback, and just plain old fun. Out of the above albums (which all up for debate), UFO's does a decent job.  They are certainly having fun, there is a big live sound, and Moog interacts well with the crowd.  UFO's music is not as good as the other groups, but this album should be part of one's &#34;Live&#34; collection.  Highlight are &#34;Lights Out&#34;.
1556438850|5.0|exceeded my expectations in everyway!!  AI love the history and philosophy ! An area I feel is gravely overlooked or excluded!!
B000005RU2|5.0|If you read my review of UFO's Strangers in the Night&#34;, you will see my favorite rock live albums and criteria for inclusion. I like Deep Purple music (and saw them live too) and believe this is one of the top live recordings one should own. Unlike Lizzy's equally great &#34;Live and Dangerous&#34;, this album sounds more raw and &#34;live&#34;. Glover's spontaneous voice is just amazing and the band is tight and loose and the same time. There are some long songs that are great to lose oneself in with the band.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't believe I pour myself through the torture of reading books I know will have a sad ending. But I do it over and over, and I will continue to do so if only to absorb the beautiful deaths of my fictitious loved ones. To the people who say this book was bad and not about cancer, I hate to sound portentous, but you're completely mistaken. So what if it's not about cancer? Cancer isn't the bad guy...it just wants too be alive as John Green beautifully illustrated in this novel. I fell in love with Augustus Waters, and I may just have to read this book again. Maybe it's my version of Hazel' s favorite novel.

B000AM2L1O|2.0|We have 2 of the Middleton dolls, and one of these Corolle dolls.  The dolls are comparable in size and style.  Our Corolle doll hasn't held up nearly as well as the Middleton dolls.  In fact, the leg is coming off- where the harder plastic meets the stuffing on the leg, it is falling off.  Not impressed.  Perhaps we just got a bad one, but I expect more from a doll that gets such high ratings.
1587143879|2.0|The books are solid, interesting, informative... but not focused on what is on the exams and what materials need to be learned to succeed at the exams. Given that these books are not directly focused on real life problems and &#34;how to be a good beginning admin&#34;, and they're only perhaps 60-70% relevant to the exams, I'd suggest a different resource more focused on whichever need you're attempting to meet.

B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I loved this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone. With Katniss, the world seems so amazing and interesting because of her point of view!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Although the material was pretty dark (slavery) I found the story very compelling. I really felt that I was right there with the characters in the late 1700's early 1800's and I really felt for the them as they struggled against evil overseers and other authority figures in their lives
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Most fun game I've ever played, funny and creative, let's you forget your day with lots of laughs, would recommend to all ages six and up
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|I wish there was a way to shut Sea World down. I will never go there and will never take my kids there. I have felt for a long time that whales do not belong in captivity. There is no way for us to possibly recreate their actual natural environment. I am not a tree-hugger or an environmentalist, but even I can see these animals are extremely intelligent and it is morally wrong to keep them in captivity. Let people appreciate them in the wild from a distance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A beautifully constructed chest that unfolds a mystery as you unlock its different devices. This game is beautifully rendered and the box is a joy to explore with so many elaborate mechanisms. This game is miles ahead of the rest
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Just awesome! If you are a fan of dark science fiction I would highly recommend. Creepy, funny, emotional and thought-provoking; Anna Torv, John Noble and Josh Jackson crush these roles. Great acting, writing and production. A must see!
B009AY04A8|4.0|this is your typical hidden object game. find the object by name or shape. its all pieced together with some unecessary pirate story line. either way, fun for all and fun for hours.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I love Riordans' books! Great mythology through out the book. I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Greek/Roman mythology or for children over 10.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Great album, showed the people he stil has what it takes to be a great emcee. I would defiently give this two thumbs up and I rarely buy cds anymore...think this is the first one I've bought since...Alchemist back in 2001
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I love this series of books.  They are an easy read and interesting.  I would recommend this series to my friends.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This program saved my life! I was able to do a lot of work with it. It was adequate for my office needs and I will continue to use it!
1451696191|4.0|The main character Charlie is a quirky, deep thinker who is out-of-step with his classmates.  While Charlie's social and mental health struggles are more extreme than those of most young people, I think any adolescent can relate to the difficulties Charlie faces in understanding himself and who is and wants to be.  It was a hard story to put down.<br />My only criticism is that Charlie's voice is, in my opinion, too young.  He is supposed to be extrememly bright, and particularly gifted in English.  Although he definitely has unusual insight, his writing does not feel like a super smart 9th grader.  The story is told through a series of letters, which in content are like a diary, and so the tone is rightly very casual.  However, sometimes it sounded like it was written by my 4th grade son rather than a super-reader freshman.<br />Also, parents should be aware that there is a lot of casual drug use by the protagonists.  If my kids read this book some day, it is something I would want to talk about with them.  There is also a lot of sexual content, but it is handled in a way that is a lot more cautionary, so is less troubling to me as a parent.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fun and good for the grey matter.  Well worth the price.  Great scenery.  Good story line.  Nice background music track.
B004F1F32A|5.0|The premise is a little flaky, but ignore that and it's an action packed, seat of your pants thriller. Highly recommended!!!!!
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|Same white screen issue as others reported on kindle fire hd. I have same program on my pc and it works great. Was hoping to get access to my server from my kindle as well. Will have to wait I guess.
B0034JKZ8G|5.0|My grand daughter loves this movie! Had it recorded at one time but erased it! Now we can watch it any time we want! Lovy Disney tale!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Great content, Interesting puzzles. Just wish there was more of it because I Completed game in 3 or 4 hours.
1476727651|4.0|SK's plots are truly twisted and unique. I only wish it had more more in-depth scary character stuff like some of his earlier stuff and was longer with more &#34;gottcha&#34; moments.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's war and very realistic in violence and the after effects of it. So much pain and blood it's hard to read. The story keeps you turning the page but at the same time wishing for respite. The ending is probably  a realistic one without any flowers but after all is said and done I would have liked a little more happiness for those that lived through the tragedy and lose.
0395389496|5.0|This is a classic kids story.  I read it every year to my little one.  The book has held up nicely.
0446547638|4.0|It was a great book but why did Dawson ahve to die after a long loss love and die :(?
